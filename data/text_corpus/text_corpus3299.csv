16495,this study demonstrates that cu ii can significantly enhance the decomposition rate of bromamines apparent second order rate constants of 2 31 0 01 m 1s 1 and 0 36 0 01 m 1s 1 at ph 7 5 were determined for the reaction of cu ii with bromamines and the self decomposition of bromamines respectively increasing the ph from 6 0 to 8 5 the rate of bromamines self decomposition decreased while the rate of cu ii catalysed decomposition of bromamines increased species specific rate constants indicated that cu oh 2 was the most reactive copper species towards nh2br and nhbr2 experiments were carried out with 15n labelled bromamines to analyse the nitrogenous degradation products of bromamines in the presence and absence of cu ii nitrogen gas n2 was found to be the major product from the self decomposition of bromamines with n2o no2 and no3 as additional minor products when cu ii was present the product distribution changed and no2 and n2o became significant while n2 and no3 were produced at low levels increasing the cu ii concentration from 1 0 to 5 0 mg l increased the n2o production while decreased the no2 formation based on these results a mechanism for cu ii catalysed decomposition of bromamines is proposed this work provides new insights related to the chemistry of bromamines in chloraminated drinking water distribution systems where copper is present graphical

bromide and chlorine ozone peracetic acid in the presence of ammonia or chloramines heeb et al 2017 inman and johnson 1984 inman et al 1976 luh and mariñas 2014 pope and speitel 2008 soulard et al 1981 trogolo and arey 2016 during ozone peracetic acid treatments and in line chloramination i e when chlorine is added before ammonia addition bromide is oxidized to bromine hobr which further reacts with ammonia to produce monobromamine nh2br in equilibrium with dibromamine nhbr2 allard et al 2018 alsulaili et al 2010 buffle et al 2004 inman and johnson 1984 another pathway to form nh2br is the reaction between monochloramine nh2cl and bromide even though nh2br is formed at much lower concentration than bromochloramine nhbrcl trofe et al 1980 it was shown by kinetic modelling that nh2br accumulated up to 12 of nh2cl at alkaline ph during in line formed chloramination allard et al 2018 bromamines include three species monobromamine nh2br dibromamine nhbr2 and tribromamine nbr3 the distribution of these bromamines is highly dependant on the ph and n br ratio hu et al 2021b kirmeyer 2004 wajon and morris 1982 under typical drinking water conditions ph 6 8 5 bromide 10 2000 µg l allard et al 2018 magazinovic et al 2004 ammonia 0 15 mg l typical value for n br molar ratio is 1 to 1000 turan and celik 2003 vartiainen et al 1988 nh2br and nhbr2 are the major bromamines species present in solutions and nbr3 is not formed allard et al 2018 hofmann and andrews 2001 lei et al 2004 in this manuscript bromamines refer to the sum of nh2br and nhbr2 nh2br and nhbr2 are highly reactive towards different inorganic and organic substances compared to their chloramine analogues heeb et al 2017 for example nh2br was more reactive than nh2cl with cn with second order rate constants of 2 63 104 m 1s 1 and 1 96 10 2 m 1s 1 respectively lei et al 2006 schurter et al 1995 the same behaviour was observed with organic compounds e g nh2br reacted four orders of magnitude faster with phenol compared to nh2cl heeb et al 2017 the reaction rates between nh2br and amino acids were a hundred times higher than with nh2cl simon et al 2015 it has also been demonstrated that nh2br and nhbr2 have a higher potential to produce disinfection by products dbps in comparison to nh2cl allard et al 2018 pope and speitel 2008 for instance formation of trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas was significantly enhanced when amino acids were reacting with nh2br compared to nh2cl simon et al 2015 the presence of bromamines also led to a shift from chlorinated dbps cl dbps to brominated dbps br dbps in chloraminated distribution systems and it is well accepted that br dbps have a higher toxicity than their chlorinated analogues hua and reckhow 2012 richardson et al 2007 sharma et al 2014 chloramine decomposition by products have been experimentally identified previously vikesland and valentine showed that nitrogen gas n2 and ammonia were the major nitrogen decay products of nh2cl self decomposition vikesland et al 1998 in the presence of natural organic matter nom the speciation of the decomposition products changed nitrogen gas formation was decreased while ammonia and nitrate formation were promoted and ammonia became the dominant nitrogen decay product vikesland et al 1998 however the decomposition products of bromamines have not previously been experimentally determined dissolved copper is present in drinking water either as an added biocide to prevent nitrification or as a corrosion product from copper pipes borkow and gabbay 2005 liu et al 2013c lytle and nadagouda 2010 xiao et al 2007 zhang and andrews 2012 changing disinfectants might also affect the release of copper from water pipes boyd et al 2008 gonzalez et al 2013 a survey of water samples collected from 2944 households containing copper plumbing reported that the median and maximum copper concentration were 0 45 mg l and 4 2 mg l respectively zietz et al 2003 the guideline values for copper in drinking water are set at 2 0 mg l and 1 3 mg l by the world health organization who and united states environmental protection agency usepa respectively usepa 2002 world health organization 2017 metals cu ii and fe ii have been shown to enhance the decomposition rate of monochloramine fu et al 2009a 2009b vikesland and valentine 2000 copper oxide cuo has been extensively investigated as it can catalyse oxidants clo2 nh2cl hocl and hobr decay in the drinking water distribution pipeline hu et al 2021a liu et al 2014 2013a b liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2008b for example cuo catalysed hocl and hobr disproportionation leading to the formation of toxic chlorite chlorate and bromate liu et al 2013a 2012 in locations where distribution systems are large and extend up to several hundred kilometers the stability of the residual disinfectant is crucial to ensuring the delivery of safe drinking water to consumers li et al 2019 furthermore copper contamination from corrosion of premise plumbing pipes may affect the residual disinfectant on a much shorter timescale compared to distribution systems zhang et al 2008a this study aimed to explore the catalytic properties of copper with bromamines formed in water containing ammonia and bromide the effects of several parameters type of copper ph and cu ii concentration based on typical water treatment conditions were investigated to determine their impact on the decomposition of bromamines species specific rate constants were determined and the degradation products from the decomposition of bromamines were characterised based on these findings a mechanism for the decomposition of monobromamine is proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents all chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade purity and stock solutions were prepared with deionized water 18 2 mω cm milli q millipore ammonium chloride ammonium sulfate potassium bromide and copper ii sulfate pentahydrate were obtained from chem supply pty ltd cuo powder was prepared according to the method described previously and it was insoluble at ph 8 6 liu et al 2012 stock copper solutions 2 g l were prepared by dissolving copper ii sulfate in deionized water chlorine stock solutions were prepared by diluting a commercial sodium hypochlorite solution 10 15 active chlorine sigma aldrich and standardized spectrophotometrically at λmax of 292 nm using a molar absorptivity of 362 m 1cm 1 for ocl furman and margerum 1998 bromine stock solutions 2 mm were produced by the aqueous reaction of naocl with kbr molar ratio br ocl of 1 05 at ph 11 adjusted by naoh for 24 h for full conversion of ocl to obr lei et al 2004 liu et al 2012 the produced bromine stock solution was kept at 4 c and used for a maximum of 2 weeks after its preparation the bromine concentration was standardized spectrophotometrically at a λmax of 329 nm using a molar absorptivity of 332 m 1cm 1 for obr troy and margerum 1991 nh2br stock solutions were synthesised by mixing equal volumes of nh4cl or nh4 2so4 and hobr both prepared in 20 mm ph 9 borate buffer solutions at an n br molar ratio of 1000 1 or 100 1 lei et al 2004 the effect of n br molar ratio on nh2br stability is presented in fig s1 a high n br molar ratio of 1000 1 was applied to synthesise a stable bromamines solution for kinetic experiments for the reaction of bromamines with cu ii hu et al 2021b lei et al 2004 while a lower n br molar ratio of 100 1 was used for product studies from the bromamines self decomposition as well as from the reaction of bromamines with cu ii the influence of chloride and sulfate as typical anions on the bromamines decomposition with and without cu ii is presented in fig s2 and text s1 in accordance with these results nh4cl was used for the kinetic investigation while nh4 2so4 was used for the mechanistic investigation it was confirmed that chloride concentration had no effect on bromamines decomposition kinetics in the absence and presence of cu ii fig s3 the resulting nh2br and nhbr2 concentrations were quantified by uv vis spectrometry using their representative molar absorptivities ε n h 2 br 232 82 m 1cm 1 ε n h 2 br 278 425 m 1cm 1 ε nhb r 2 232 2000 m 1cm 1 ε nhb r 2 278 715 m 1cm 1 as described previously lei et al 2004 2 2 analytical methods the presence of cu ii in bromamines solutions could interfere with direct uv measurement therefore bromamines concentrations during the reaction of bromamines with copper were analysed spectrophotometrically using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method at 515 nm as bromamines nh2br 2 nhbr2 liu et al 2012 nitrite and nitrate analyses were performed by a dionex ics 3000 ion chromatography ic with a suppressed conductivity detection and an ionpac as9 hc column salhi and von gunten 1999 total copper concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy at 324 8 nm with a detection limit of 0 05 mg l x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was used to differentiate different copper species i e cu i and cu ii biesinger 2017 in order to get an adequate amount of solid copper to perform the xps analyses a 1 l solution containing 500 µm nh2br and 1 mm cu ii was reacted for 2 h thereafter the solution was placed in an oven at 70 c until the aqueous phase was evaporated and the solid completely dried the 15n2 analyses was performed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms based on the method developed by vikesland et al 1996 a cylinder containing 15n2 gas 98 purity sigma aldrich was used as a 15n2 standard to calibrate the gc ms 15n labelled ammonium sulfate was used to avoid the interference of the ubiquitous 14n2 present in the air sealed 20 ml amber vials with 10 ml solution and 10 ml headspace were used while an equilibrium of nitrogen gas between the aqueous phase and gas phase could be achieved at room temperature 24 1 c it was calculated that 98 of the nitrogen gas produced partitions in the headspace vikesland et al 1996 10 µl of the headspace gas was withdrawn using a gas tight syringe and introduced to the gc ms for the analysis of 15n2 ion count at a mass to charge m z value of 30 was monitored to quantify the nitrogen gas production from the decomposition of bromamines an example of the calibration curve obtained for 15n2 quantification is shown in fig s4 membrane introduction mass spectrometry mims microlab aarhus denmark was used to separately analyse the different bromamines 15n2o and 15no2 the use of mims enabled the quantification of nh2br nhbr2 and nhbrcl hu et al 2021b while had uv vis spectrometry been used overlapping peaks may have led to uncertainties and had colorimetric reagents methods been used they would have measured the sum of the bromamines to avoid any interference from co2 which has the same m z value of 44 as 14n2o 15n labelled ammonium sulfate was used the inlet membrane temperature was set to 40 c and the liquid sample flow rate was controlled at 2 2 ml min to analyse for nh2br and nhbr2 m z values of 97 and 175 respectively were selected hu et al 2021b the 14n2o gas was prepared in accordance with the boiling water bath method li and blatchley 2008 a saturated 14n2o solution was obtained by dissolution of the 14n2o gas at 25 c 14n2o standard solutions were obtained by serial dilutions of the saturated solution in 20 ml amber vials with no headspace an m z value of 44 was used to calibrate the mims for 14n2o and an m z value of 46 was used to calculate the concentration of 15n2o for real samples with 15n labelled precursors it was considered that 14n2o and 15n2o produced similar mass spectra in the mims except for a mass shift of 2 amu li and blatchley 2008 the 14n2o concentrations and mims response presented a good linear relationship with correlation coefficient of 0 9994 fig s5 the formation of 15no2 was also monitored by mims using an m z value of 47 but not quantified due to the lack of an analytical standard all experiments in this study were conducted in duplicate it was not possible to quantify ammonia because of the high n br molar ratio of 1000 1 or 100 1 used to synthesise monobromamine i e the produced ammonia only accounted for a maximum of 0 1 of the total ammonia in the solution no detectable bromochloramine was observed by using mims or kinetic modelling under our experimental conditions figs s6 and s7 2 3 kinetic study the experiments were conducted in a batch reactor 100 ml volume under gentle magnetic stirring at room temperature 24 1 c the bromamines solutions 50 µm were prepared by diluting the freshly prepared monobromamine stock 200 µm solutions with deionized water the ph of the solutions were established by the addition of hcl h2so4 or naoh using an automatic ph titrator metrohm 857 titrando before the addition of cu ii 0 5 mg l the concentration of the acid and base in the ph titrator was varied according to the targeted ph to ensure a minimal variation of the solution volume for experiments at ph 9 and above a borate buffer was used to maintain the ph the ph titrator was used at ph values below 9 because borate buffer is not effective at this ph range and in the presence of a phosphate buffer copper phosphate complexes are formed liu et al 2013a the variations in ph during the experiments were less than 0 1 ph units from the targeted ph conditions samples were collected periodically for the analysis of bromamines concentrations the kinetic simulations of the decomposition of bromamines in the presence and absence of cu ii were carried out using the kintecus program allard et al 2018 ianni 2018 2 4 mechanistic study due to the interference of chloride on nitrite analysis by ic nh4 2so4 was used instead of nh4cl to synthesise nh2br at an n br molar ratio of 100 1 different cu ii dosages 0 5 mg l were added to the bromamines solutions 200 µm the solutions were left in the dark for 52 h to ensure all the oxidant was consumed except for the experiment without copper where the sample was quenched with sodium sulphite for nitrite and nitrate analysis as a residual oxidant was still present the presence of 15n was used to determine 15n2 15n2o and 15no2 these experiments were carried out in 20 ml amber vials at ph 9 2 with a 20 mm borate buffer the mechanistic experiments were performed at ph 9 2 in order to maximise the formation of nh2br and minimise the presence of nhbr2 therefore only one species i e nh2br was used to explain the formation of degradation products and propose a mechanism for the copper induced bromamine decomposition 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of different copper species on the decomposition of bromamines fig 1 shows the decomposition of bromamines nh2br nhbr2 in the absence and presence of cuo and cu ii at ph 7 5 it was verified by direct uv measurement that nh2br accounted for 90 of the bromamines at ph 7 5 with an n br molar ratio of 1000 1 fig s8 in the absence of copper the decay of bromamines at ph 7 5 accounted for 28 of the initial concentration after 3 h the addition of cu ii 0 5 mg l 7 8 µm increased the decomposition of bromamines to 40 of the initial concentration after 3 h increasing the cu ii concentration to 2 0 mg l 31 2 µm increased the decomposition of bromamines to 65 of the initial concentration in contrast to cu ii the presence of 31 2 µm cuo had little effect on bromamines decomposition while 625 µm cuo showed only a moderate effect on the decomposition of bromamines with only a 38 decay in the initial concentration of bromamines in 3 h the dissolved cu ii concentration from the solution containing 50 mg l cuo was less than 0 05 mg l below the detection limit this indicated that for an equivalent molar copper concentration cu ii is more efficient in degrading bromamines than cuo this behaviour differs from other oxidants where cu ii had a little effect on hocl and nh2cl decay fu et al 2009c nguyen et al 2011 and cuo catalytically degraded hocl hobr and clo2 liu et al 2013b 2012 the enhanced decay of hocl hobr and clo2 has been explained by a catalytic disproportionation mechanism in which adsorption of these oxidants on the cuo surface is important apparently this surface catalysed disproportionation mechanism is not possible for cu ii further investigation is warranted for the reactivity difference between cu ii and cuo toward these halogen based oxidants 3 2 effect of cu ii concentration on the kinetics of the decomposition of bromamines to identify if both nh2br and nhbr2 were impacted by the presence of cu ii the mims response was recorded for nh2br m z value of 97 and nhbr2 m z value of 175 in the presence and absence of cu ii fig 2 it is known that nhbr2 fragments will interfere with the analysis of nh2br hu et al 2021b thus a high ph of 9 2 was used to minimise the formation of nhbr2 fig 2a b show that the presence of cu ii significantly enhanced the decomposition of nh2br and nhbr2 it was evidenced that the mims results were consistent with the dpd results fig s9 under these experimental conditions the half lives of nh2br decay decreased from 6 h to 55 min 27 min and 13 min in the presence of 0 1 0 2 0 and 5 0 mg l cu ii respectively the same trend was observed for nhbr2 with half lives decreasing from 1 7 h to 13 8 min 7 8 min and 3 9 min respectively for the same cu ii concentrations subsequently the decomposition of bromamines in the presence of varying cu ii concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 0 mg l at ph 7 5 were studied as shown in fig 3 a the decomposition rate for bromamines increased with increasing cu ii concentration from 0 2 to 5 0 mg l fig 3a the pseudo first order rate constant k obs for the decomposition of bromamines was determined from the slope of logarithmic relative concentration of bromamines versus time at different cu ii concentration fig s10 even though cu ii was not present in large excess a good linear response was obtained using a pseudo first order rate equation with r2 ranging from 0 9859 to 0 9998 indicating that cu ii acted as a catalyst fig 3b shows the k obs as a function of cu ii concentration the k obs values increased linearly with increasing cu ii concentrations with r2 0 9988 this indicates that the reaction between bromamines and cu ii is first order with respect to both bromamines and cu ii suggesting that the overall reaction follows a second order rate law a second order kinetics was chosen based on the molecular mechanism nh2br nh2br products for the self decomposition of monobromamine k 0 was calculated to be 0 36 0 01 m 1s 1 based on the bromamines decomposition experiment without cu ii fig s11 other reactions e g nh2br nhbr2 products might affect the stability of nh2br as comprehensively depicted in numerous studies lei et al 2004 luh and mariñas 2014 wahman et al 2017 however they were not introduced in eq 1 due to their negligible contribution compared to self decomposition and reaction with cu ii table s1 and fig s12 since nh2br accounted for 90 of the bromamines nh2br was used to model the system the rate law for the decomposition of bromamines mainly nh2br in the presence of cu ii at ph 7 5 may be expressed as follows 1 d nh2br dt k0 nh2br 2 kapp nh2br cu ii where k 0 represents the second order rate constant for nh2br self decomposition and k app represents the second order rate constant for cu ii induced nh2br decomposition the rate constant k app was obtained from the slope of k obs versus cu ii concentration and found to be 2 31 0 01 m 1s 1 fig 3b the calculated rate constants were used to simulate the decomposition of bromamines both with and without the presence of cu ii the modelling results are in good agreement with experimental data for the decomposition of bromamines in the presence of cu ii at ph 7 5 fig 3a 3 3 effect of ph on the decomposition of bromamines the decomposition of bromamines in the absence and presence of 2 0 mg l cu ii for different values of ph between 6 0 and 8 5 are shown in fig 4 the decay of bromamines in the absence of cu ii decreased from 45 9 to 12 4 after 3 h when the ph was increased from 6 0 to 8 5 fig s13a in the presence of cu ii the decay of bromamines is relatively similar for all phs with 54 4 52 7 57 7 and 53 5 decomposition of the initial concentration at ph 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 8 5 after 3 h respectively fig s13b however cu ii induced bromamines decomposition i e the difference between the self decomposition of bromamines and cu ii induced bromamines decomposition increased with increasing ph fig 4 an additional experiment was carried out with a 20 molar excess of ammonia at ph 8 5 to mimic the lower limit for nh4cl br molar ratio as shown in fig s14 the decay of bromamines was already significant in the absence of cu ii and became faster in the presence of 2 0 mg l of cu ii this indicates that under low nh4cl br molar ratio the self decomposition of bromamines is likely to be predominant compared to the reaction with copper however the impact of copper is still significant under these conditions in order to calculate cu ii induced first order rate constant for the decomposition of bromamines k cu ii the first order rate constant for the self decomposition of bromamines k 0 was subtracted from the first order rate constant for the decomposition of bromamines in the presence of 2 mg l cu ii k obs pseudo first order linearization was used for both experiments with and without the presence of cu ii fig s15 the pseudo first order rate constant for the self decomposition of bromamines increased from 1 17 10 5 s 1 to 6 00 10 5 s 1 at ph 8 5 and 6 0 respectively this ph related trend is consistent with the previous study conducted by lei et al 2004 the calculated cu ii induced first order rate constants for the decomposition of bromamines are presented in fig 5 similar to the oxidation of manganese by bromine allard et al 2013 the ph dependency of k cu ii can be explained by the speciation of cu ii and the speciation of the bromamines monobromamine 97 was the dominant bromamine species at ph 8 5 whereas dibromamine 62 was dominant at ph 6 0 fig s8 the distribution of cu ii species is also dependant on ph fig s16 the species specific rate constants were determined according to equation 2 2 k cu ii α c u 2 k c u 2 n h 2 br α n h 2 br k c u 2 nhb r 2 α nhb r 2 α cu oh k cu oh n h 2 br α n h 2 br k cu oh nhb r 2 α nhb r 2 α cu oh 2 k cu oh 2 n h 2 br α n h 2 br k cu oh 2 nhb r 2 α nhb r 2 where α c u 2 α cu oh and α cu oh 2 represent the fraction of cu2 cu oh and cu oh 2 for example α c u 2 cu2 cu 2 tot with cu2 tot cu2 cu oh cu oh 2 similarly α n h 2 br and α nhb r 2 represent the fraction of nh2br and nhbr2 respectively values of k c u 2 n h 2 br k c u 2 nhb r 2 k cu oh n h 2 br k cu oh nhb r 2 k cu oh 2 n h 2 br and k cu oh 2 nhb r 2 represent the species specific second order rate constant bromamines speciation i e the initial ratio of nh2br and nhbr2 at different values of ph were determined by using a kinetic model developed in a previous study fig s17 allard et al 2018 while the speciation of copper could be calculated by using the pka values of 7 4 for cu2 cu oh and 8 6 for cu oh cu oh 2 fig s16 the species specific rate constants were determined via nonlinear least square regression analyses using sigmaplot the procedure used for calculating the species specific rate constants using sigmaplot are presented in fig s18 the values of k c u 2 nhb r 2 k cu oh nhb r 2 k cu oh 2 n h 2 br and k cu oh 2 nhb r 2 were determined to be 1 33 0 40 10 5 m 1s 1 2 78 0 20 10 4 m 1s 1 6 25 1 68 10 5 m 1s 1 and 1 29 0 25 10 3 m 1s 1 respectively while k c u 2 n h 2 br and k cu oh n h 2 br were found negligible using these calculated species specific second order rate constants the model fitting shown in fig 5 black line for ph ranging from 6 to 8 5 demonstrates that eq 2 describes the k cu ii well nh2br was solely reactive with cu oh 2 as cu oh 2 is a stronger nucleophile than either cu2 or cu oh and it is also more reactive towards the electrophiles nh2br and nhbr2 as expected nhbr2 reactivity with the different copper species is higher than nh2br since it is more electrophilic due to the presence of two bromine atoms the reactivity of nhbr2 is also dominated by the hydroxo species cu oh and cu oh 2 3 4 products from the decomposition of bromamines it was verified by using a previously published ionic chromatography method salhi and von gunten 1999 that bromate was not formed during the decomposition of bromamines in the presence of cu ii therefore bromine in bromamines is fully reduced to bromide the loss of bromamines and the production of n2 n2o no2 and no3 for the decomposition of bromamines in the presence and absence of cu ii after 52 h reaction time at ph 9 2 are shown in fig 6 the nitrogen decay products n2 n2o no2 and no3 provide direct evidence of the mechanism of the reaction between monobromamine and cu ii by comparing the distribution of products in the presence and absence of cu ii it is possible to gain insight into the pathways for the decay of bromamines the percentage recoveries in mole of the different nitrogen species are presented in table s2 in the absence of cu ii the total nitrogen recovery for nh2br self decomposition was 109 2 similar to nh2cl decomposition in pure water system vikesland et al 1998 n2 was the primary nitrogen decay product accounting for 76 5 while n2o no2 and no3 were measured at low concentrations with 11 6 15 2 and 6 0 of total nitrogen respectively fig 6 and table s2 in the presence of cu ii the distribution of nitrogen containing degradation products changed the addition of cu ii led to a significant reduction in the formation of n2 the formation of n2 only accounted for 11 6 6 6 and 6 0 of the total nitrogen in the presence of 1 0 mg l 2 0 mg l and 5 0 mg l of cu ii respectively it was found that n2o and no2 were the major products during the cu ii induced decomposition of bromamines representing a much higher proportion of the total nitrogen than in the self decomposition of bromamines interestingly n2o formation increased while no2 formation decreased with increasing cu ii concentrations in the presence of 1 0 mg l cu ii n2o represented 29 5 and no2 51 8 of total nitrogen conversely n2o accounted for 48 1 and no2 for 24 0 of total nitrogen in the presence of 5 0 mg l cu ii fig s19a shows the initial stage 1 h of n2o production monitored by mims confirming the enhanced n2o formation with increasing cu ii concentrations no3 was formed at low concentrations in all conditions studied overall the total nitrogen recoveries in the presence of cu ii ranged from 98 to 80 for 1 0 to 5 0 mg l cu ii respectively it may be hypothesized that other nitrogen decay products may have formed in the presence of cu ii such as nh4 and no2 fig s19b shows the mims response for an m z value of 47 which corresponds to the mass of 15no2 the no2 concentration increased with increasing cu ii concentrations therefore it may be one of the missing nitrogen decay products however no2 is expected to be present at low concentration as it rapidly undergoes dimerization to form nitrite and nitrate huie 1994 3 5 proposed reaction mechanism in order to elucidate the different reaction pathways involved in the decomposition of bromamines by cu ii xps was used to investigate the change in oxidation state during copper reaction with bromamines fig s20 compares the xps spectra of a cucl2 s standard and the copper particles collected after reaction with bromamines the cu 2p of the cucl2 standard showed that it had two peaks at binding energy of 934 8 ev and 954 5 ev similar to that of 934 6 ev and 954 4 ev of cucl2 reported in the literature van der laan et al 1981 it was found that the copper particle sample presented two peaks at binding energy of 931 7 ev and 951 5 ev the cucl s standard has peaks at similar binding energy 932 2 ev and 952 1 ev robert and offergeld 1972 indicating that cu i was produced in the reaction based on the copper species produced the formation of degradation products observed in the previous section and according to the literature the following reaction mechanism for monobromamine decomposition in the presence of cu ii is proposed in scheme 1 at ph 9 2 monobromamine is the dominant bromamines species therefore only monobromamine is described in the reaction mechanism even though there is no direct evidence of the presence of radicals it is hypothesised that similar to the mechanism of nh2cl and h2o2 decay in the presence of cu ii fu et al 2009b lee et al 2014 cu ii is reduced to cu i via a one electron transfer reaction and produces a nhbr radical 3 cu i is oxidised to cu ii by nh2br forming an amine radical nh2 and bromide 4 this confirms the catalytic behaviour of cu ii allowing the use of pseudo first order conditions to determine rate constants once nh2 is formed it quickly reacts with o2 and forms an intermediate peroxyl radical nh2o2 5 clarke et al 2008 laszlo et al 1998 thereafter nh2o2 is decomposed in two parallel reaction pathways pathway 1 leads to the formation of no and h2o laszlo et al 1998 the no is not a stable product and is oxidized to nitrite in the presence of o2 ignarro et al 1993 or leads to the formation of no2 as evidenced by mims 6 and 7 in pathways 2 two nh2o2 are reacting which leads to a formation of two hno and one h2o2 the formed hno decays rapidly to n2o and h2o 10 bazylinski and hollocher 1985 schreiber and mitch 2007 this is consistent with our findings fig 6 i e the two main byproducts no2 and n2o are in competition since one is coming from pathway 1 and the other one from pathway 2 the formation of no3 is coming from no2 oxidation by monobromamine or no2 dissolution in water 8 and 9 similar to nh2 it is hypothesised that nhbr radical reacts with o2 to produce a peroxyl radical nhbro2 that further degrades and forms n2o and no2 as the major end products 4 conclusions and environmental implications in real chloraminated water distribution systems the formation of nitrite from the decomposition of bromamines in the presence of cu ii indicates that nitrification of ammonia by oxidising bacteria may not be the only source of nitrite where cu ii and bromide are present this may help to understand the nitrogen balance of halamine reactions in chloraminated water distribution systems on one hand copper may be used as a biocide to avoid nitrification but on the other hand in the presence of bromide it induces the purely chemical formation of nitrite the kinetic product and mechanistic information for the reaction of bromamines with copper described in this study are very important to obtain a more quantitative understanding of the fates of nitrogen and bromine species in chloraminated distribution systems however more information is needed to comprehensively describe the chemistry in a distribution system containing a mixture of halamines nh2cl nhcl2 nhbrcl nh2br nhbr2 and copper and to thoroughly discuss practical implications based on kinetic modelling this work also has implication for br dbps management it has been demonstrated that nh2br and nhbr2 have a higher potential to produce disinfection by products dbps in comparison to nh2cl heeb et al 2017 lei et al 2006 pope and speitel 2008 simon et al 2015 our results indicates that bromamines is catalytically degraded in presence of copper therefore there will be a competition between copper and nom for reaction with bromamines which may lead to the lower formation of br dbps overall the improved understanding on the stability and decay of bromamines in the presence of copper will allow a better management of potentially toxic br dbps formation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

16495,this study demonstrates that cu ii can significantly enhance the decomposition rate of bromamines apparent second order rate constants of 2 31 0 01 m 1s 1 and 0 36 0 01 m 1s 1 at ph 7 5 were determined for the reaction of cu ii with bromamines and the self decomposition of bromamines respectively increasing the ph from 6 0 to 8 5 the rate of bromamines self decomposition decreased while the rate of cu ii catalysed decomposition of bromamines increased species specific rate constants indicated that cu oh 2 was the most reactive copper species towards nh2br and nhbr2 experiments were carried out with 15n labelled bromamines to analyse the nitrogenous degradation products of bromamines in the presence and absence of cu ii nitrogen gas n2 was found to be the major product from the self decomposition of bromamines with n2o no2 and no3 as additional minor products when cu ii was present the product distribution changed and no2 and n2o became significant while n2 and no3 were produced at low levels increasing the cu ii concentration from 1 0 to 5 0 mg l increased the n2o production while decreased the no2 formation based on these results a mechanism for cu ii catalysed decomposition of bromamines is proposed this work provides new insights related to the chemistry of bromamines in chloraminated drinking water distribution systems where copper is present graphical

bromide and chlorine ozone peracetic acid in the presence of ammonia or chloramines heeb et al 2017 inman and johnson 1984 inman et al 1976 luh and mariñas 2014 pope and speitel 2008 soulard et al 1981 trogolo and arey 2016 during ozone peracetic acid treatments and in line chloramination i e when chlorine is added before ammonia addition bromide is oxidized to bromine hobr which further reacts with ammonia to produce monobromamine nh2br in equilibrium with dibromamine nhbr2 allard et al 2018 alsulaili et al 2010 buffle et al 2004 inman and johnson 1984 another pathway to form nh2br is the reaction between monochloramine nh2cl and bromide even though nh2br is formed at much lower concentration than bromochloramine nhbrcl trofe et al 1980 it was shown by kinetic modelling that nh2br accumulated up to 12 of nh2cl at alkaline ph during in line formed chloramination allard et al 2018 bromamines include three species monobromamine nh2br dibromamine nhbr2 and tribromamine nbr3 the distribution of these bromamines is highly dependant on the ph and n br ratio hu et al 2021b kirmeyer 2004 wajon and morris 1982 under typical drinking water conditions ph 6 8 5 bromide 10 2000 µg l allard et al 2018 magazinovic et al 2004 ammonia 0 15 mg l typical value for n br molar ratio is 1 to 1000 turan and celik 2003 vartiainen et al 1988 nh2br and nhbr2 are the major bromamines species present in solutions and nbr3 is not formed allard et al 2018 hofmann and andrews 2001 lei et al 2004 in this manuscript bromamines refer to the sum of nh2br and nhbr2 nh2br and nhbr2 are highly reactive towards different inorganic and organic substances compared to their chloramine analogues heeb et al 2017 for example nh2br was more reactive than nh2cl with cn with second order rate constants of 2 63 104 m 1s 1 and 1 96 10 2 m 1s 1 respectively lei et al 2006 schurter et al 1995 the same behaviour was observed with organic compounds e g nh2br reacted four orders of magnitude faster with phenol compared to nh2cl heeb et al 2017 the reaction rates between nh2br and amino acids were a hundred times higher than with nh2cl simon et al 2015 it has also been demonstrated that nh2br and nhbr2 have a higher potential to produce disinfection by products dbps in comparison to nh2cl allard et al 2018 pope and speitel 2008 for instance formation of trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas was significantly enhanced when amino acids were reacting with nh2br compared to nh2cl simon et al 2015 the presence of bromamines also led to a shift from chlorinated dbps cl dbps to brominated dbps br dbps in chloraminated distribution systems and it is well accepted that br dbps have a higher toxicity than their chlorinated analogues hua and reckhow 2012 richardson et al 2007 sharma et al 2014 chloramine decomposition by products have been experimentally identified previously vikesland and valentine showed that nitrogen gas n2 and ammonia were the major nitrogen decay products of nh2cl self decomposition vikesland et al 1998 in the presence of natural organic matter nom the speciation of the decomposition products changed nitrogen gas formation was decreased while ammonia and nitrate formation were promoted and ammonia became the dominant nitrogen decay product vikesland et al 1998 however the decomposition products of bromamines have not previously been experimentally determined dissolved copper is present in drinking water either as an added biocide to prevent nitrification or as a corrosion product from copper pipes borkow and gabbay 2005 liu et al 2013c lytle and nadagouda 2010 xiao et al 2007 zhang and andrews 2012 changing disinfectants might also affect the release of copper from water pipes boyd et al 2008 gonzalez et al 2013 a survey of water samples collected from 2944 households containing copper plumbing reported that the median and maximum copper concentration were 0 45 mg l and 4 2 mg l respectively zietz et al 2003 the guideline values for copper in drinking water are set at 2 0 mg l and 1 3 mg l by the world health organization who and united states environmental protection agency usepa respectively usepa 2002 world health organization 2017 metals cu ii and fe ii have been shown to enhance the decomposition rate of monochloramine fu et al 2009a 2009b vikesland and valentine 2000 copper oxide cuo has been extensively investigated as it can catalyse oxidants clo2 nh2cl hocl and hobr decay in the drinking water distribution pipeline hu et al 2021a liu et al 2014 2013a b liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2008b for example cuo catalysed hocl and hobr disproportionation leading to the formation of toxic chlorite chlorate and bromate liu et al 2013a 2012 in locations where distribution systems are large and extend up to several hundred kilometers the stability of the residual disinfectant is crucial to ensuring the delivery of safe drinking water to consumers li et al 2019 furthermore copper contamination from corrosion of premise plumbing pipes may affect the residual disinfectant on a much shorter timescale compared to distribution systems zhang et al 2008a this study aimed to explore the catalytic properties of copper with bromamines formed in water containing ammonia and bromide the effects of several parameters type of copper ph and cu ii concentration based on typical water treatment conditions were investigated to determine their impact on the decomposition of bromamines species specific rate constants were determined and the degradation products from the decomposition of bromamines were characterised based on these findings a mechanism for the decomposition of monobromamine is proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards and reagents all chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade purity and stock solutions were prepared with deionized water 18 2 mω cm milli q millipore ammonium chloride ammonium sulfate potassium bromide and copper ii sulfate pentahydrate were obtained from chem supply pty ltd cuo powder was prepared according to the method described previously and it was insoluble at ph 8 6 liu et al 2012 stock copper solutions 2 g l were prepared by dissolving copper ii sulfate in deionized water chlorine stock solutions were prepared by diluting a commercial sodium hypochlorite solution 10 15 active chlorine sigma aldrich and standardized spectrophotometrically at λmax of 292 nm using a molar absorptivity of 362 m 1cm 1 for ocl furman and margerum 1998 bromine stock solutions 2 mm were produced by the aqueous reaction of naocl with kbr molar ratio br ocl of 1 05 at ph 11 adjusted by naoh for 24 h for full conversion of ocl to obr lei et al 2004 liu et al 2012 the produced bromine stock solution was kept at 4 c and used for a maximum of 2 weeks after its preparation the bromine concentration was standardized spectrophotometrically at a λmax of 329 nm using a molar absorptivity of 332 m 1cm 1 for obr troy and margerum 1991 nh2br stock solutions were synthesised by mixing equal volumes of nh4cl or nh4 2so4 and hobr both prepared in 20 mm ph 9 borate buffer solutions at an n br molar ratio of 1000 1 or 100 1 lei et al 2004 the effect of n br molar ratio on nh2br stability is presented in fig s1 a high n br molar ratio of 1000 1 was applied to synthesise a stable bromamines solution for kinetic experiments for the reaction of bromamines with cu ii hu et al 2021b lei et al 2004 while a lower n br molar ratio of 100 1 was used for product studies from the bromamines self decomposition as well as from the reaction of bromamines with cu ii the influence of chloride and sulfate as typical anions on the bromamines decomposition with and without cu ii is presented in fig s2 and text s1 in accordance with these results nh4cl was used for the kinetic investigation while nh4 2so4 was used for the mechanistic investigation it was confirmed that chloride concentration had no effect on bromamines decomposition kinetics in the absence and presence of cu ii fig s3 the resulting nh2br and nhbr2 concentrations were quantified by uv vis spectrometry using their representative molar absorptivities ε n h 2 br 232 82 m 1cm 1 ε n h 2 br 278 425 m 1cm 1 ε nhb r 2 232 2000 m 1cm 1 ε nhb r 2 278 715 m 1cm 1 as described previously lei et al 2004 2 2 analytical methods the presence of cu ii in bromamines solutions could interfere with direct uv measurement therefore bromamines concentrations during the reaction of bromamines with copper were analysed spectrophotometrically using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method at 515 nm as bromamines nh2br 2 nhbr2 liu et al 2012 nitrite and nitrate analyses were performed by a dionex ics 3000 ion chromatography ic with a suppressed conductivity detection and an ionpac as9 hc column salhi and von gunten 1999 total copper concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy at 324 8 nm with a detection limit of 0 05 mg l x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps was used to differentiate different copper species i e cu i and cu ii biesinger 2017 in order to get an adequate amount of solid copper to perform the xps analyses a 1 l solution containing 500 µm nh2br and 1 mm cu ii was reacted for 2 h thereafter the solution was placed in an oven at 70 c until the aqueous phase was evaporated and the solid completely dried the 15n2 analyses was performed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms based on the method developed by vikesland et al 1996 a cylinder containing 15n2 gas 98 purity sigma aldrich was used as a 15n2 standard to calibrate the gc ms 15n labelled ammonium sulfate was used to avoid the interference of the ubiquitous 14n2 present in the air sealed 20 ml amber vials with 10 ml solution and 10 ml headspace were used while an equilibrium of nitrogen gas between the aqueous phase and gas phase could be achieved at room temperature 24 1 c it was calculated that 98 of the nitrogen gas produced partitions in the headspace vikesland et al 1996 10 µl of the headspace gas was withdrawn using a gas tight syringe and introduced to the gc ms for the analysis of 15n2 ion count at a mass to charge m z value of 30 was monitored to quantify the nitrogen gas production from the decomposition of bromamines an example of the calibration curve obtained for 15n2 quantification is shown in fig s4 membrane introduction mass spectrometry mims microlab aarhus denmark was used to separately analyse the different bromamines 15n2o and 15no2 the use of mims enabled the quantification of nh2br nhbr2 and nhbrcl hu et al 2021b while had uv vis spectrometry been used overlapping peaks may have led to uncertainties and had colorimetric reagents methods been used they would have measured the sum of the bromamines to avoid any interference from co2 which has the same m z value of 44 as 14n2o 15n labelled ammonium sulfate was used the inlet membrane temperature was set to 40 c and the liquid sample flow rate was controlled at 2 2 ml min to analyse for nh2br and nhbr2 m z values of 97 and 175 respectively were selected hu et al 2021b the 14n2o gas was prepared in accordance with the boiling water bath method li and blatchley 2008 a saturated 14n2o solution was obtained by dissolution of the 14n2o gas at 25 c 14n2o standard solutions were obtained by serial dilutions of the saturated solution in 20 ml amber vials with no headspace an m z value of 44 was used to calibrate the mims for 14n2o and an m z value of 46 was used to calculate the concentration of 15n2o for real samples with 15n labelled precursors it was considered that 14n2o and 15n2o produced similar mass spectra in the mims except for a mass shift of 2 amu li and blatchley 2008 the 14n2o concentrations and mims response presented a good linear relationship with correlation coefficient of 0 9994 fig s5 the formation of 15no2 was also monitored by mims using an m z value of 47 but not quantified due to the lack of an analytical standard all experiments in this study were conducted in duplicate it was not possible to quantify ammonia because of the high n br molar ratio of 1000 1 or 100 1 used to synthesise monobromamine i e the produced ammonia only accounted for a maximum of 0 1 of the total ammonia in the solution no detectable bromochloramine was observed by using mims or kinetic modelling under our experimental conditions figs s6 and s7 2 3 kinetic study the experiments were conducted in a batch reactor 100 ml volume under gentle magnetic stirring at room temperature 24 1 c the bromamines solutions 50 µm were prepared by diluting the freshly prepared monobromamine stock 200 µm solutions with deionized water the ph of the solutions were established by the addition of hcl h2so4 or naoh using an automatic ph titrator metrohm 857 titrando before the addition of cu ii 0 5 mg l the concentration of the acid and base in the ph titrator was varied according to the targeted ph to ensure a minimal variation of the solution volume for experiments at ph 9 and above a borate buffer was used to maintain the ph the ph titrator was used at ph values below 9 because borate buffer is not effective at this ph range and in the presence of a phosphate buffer copper phosphate complexes are formed liu et al 2013a the variations in ph during the experiments were less than 0 1 ph units from the targeted ph conditions samples were collected periodically for the analysis of bromamines concentrations the kinetic simulations of the decomposition of bromamines in the presence and absence of cu ii were carried out using the kintecus program allard et al 2018 ianni 2018 2 4 mechanistic study due to the interference of chloride on nitrite analysis by ic nh4 2so4 was used instead of nh4cl to synthesise nh2br at an n br molar ratio of 100 1 different cu ii dosages 0 5 mg l were added to the bromamines solutions 200 µm the solutions were left in the dark for 52 h to ensure all the oxidant was consumed except for the experiment without copper where the sample was quenched with sodium sulphite for nitrite and nitrate analysis as a residual oxidant was still present the presence of 15n was used to determine 15n2 15n2o and 15no2 these experiments were carried out in 20 ml amber vials at ph 9 2 with a 20 mm borate buffer the mechanistic experiments were performed at ph 9 2 in order to maximise the formation of nh2br and minimise the presence of nhbr2 therefore only one species i e nh2br was used to explain the formation of degradation products and propose a mechanism for the copper induced bromamine decomposition 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of different copper species on the decomposition of bromamines fig 1 shows the decomposition of bromamines nh2br nhbr2 in the absence and presence of cuo and cu ii at ph 7 5 it was verified by direct uv measurement that nh2br accounted for 90 of the bromamines at ph 7 5 with an n br molar ratio of 1000 1 fig s8 in the absence of copper the decay of bromamines at ph 7 5 accounted for 28 of the initial concentration after 3 h the addition of cu ii 0 5 mg l 7 8 µm increased the decomposition of bromamines to 40 of the initial concentration after 3 h increasing the cu ii concentration to 2 0 mg l 31 2 µm increased the decomposition of bromamines to 65 of the initial concentration in contrast to cu ii the presence of 31 2 µm cuo had little effect on bromamines decomposition while 625 µm cuo showed only a moderate effect on the decomposition of bromamines with only a 38 decay in the initial concentration of bromamines in 3 h the dissolved cu ii concentration from the solution containing 50 mg l cuo was less than 0 05 mg l below the detection limit this indicated that for an equivalent molar copper concentration cu ii is more efficient in degrading bromamines than cuo this behaviour differs from other oxidants where cu ii had a little effect on hocl and nh2cl decay fu et al 2009c nguyen et al 2011 and cuo catalytically degraded hocl hobr and clo2 liu et al 2013b 2012 the enhanced decay of hocl hobr and clo2 has been explained by a catalytic disproportionation mechanism in which adsorption of these oxidants on the cuo surface is important apparently this surface catalysed disproportionation mechanism is not possible for cu ii further investigation is warranted for the reactivity difference between cu ii and cuo toward these halogen based oxidants 3 2 effect of cu ii concentration on the kinetics of the decomposition of bromamines to identify if both nh2br and nhbr2 were impacted by the presence of cu ii the mims response was recorded for nh2br m z value of 97 and nhbr2 m z value of 175 in the presence and absence of cu ii fig 2 it is known that nhbr2 fragments will interfere with the analysis of nh2br hu et al 2021b thus a high ph of 9 2 was used to minimise the formation of nhbr2 fig 2a b show that the presence of cu ii significantly enhanced the decomposition of nh2br and nhbr2 it was evidenced that the mims results were consistent with the dpd results fig s9 under these experimental conditions the half lives of nh2br decay decreased from 6 h to 55 min 27 min and 13 min in the presence of 0 1 0 2 0 and 5 0 mg l cu ii respectively the same trend was observed for nhbr2 with half lives decreasing from 1 7 h to 13 8 min 7 8 min and 3 9 min respectively for the same cu ii concentrations subsequently the decomposition of bromamines in the presence of varying cu ii concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 0 mg l at ph 7 5 were studied as shown in fig 3 a the decomposition rate for bromamines increased with increasing cu ii concentration from 0 2 to 5 0 mg l fig 3a the pseudo first order rate constant k obs for the decomposition of bromamines was determined from the slope of logarithmic relative concentration of bromamines versus time at different cu ii concentration fig s10 even though cu ii was not present in large excess a good linear response was obtained using a pseudo first order rate equation with r2 ranging from 0 9859 to 0 9998 indicating that cu ii acted as a catalyst fig 3b shows the k obs as a function of cu ii concentration the k obs values increased linearly with increasing cu ii concentrations with r2 0 9988 this indicates that the reaction between bromamines and cu ii is first order with respect to both bromamines and cu ii suggesting that the overall reaction follows a second order rate law a second order kinetics was chosen based on the molecular mechanism nh2br nh2br products for the self decomposition of monobromamine k 0 was calculated to be 0 36 0 01 m 1s 1 based on the bromamines decomposition experiment without cu ii fig s11 other reactions e g nh2br nhbr2 products might affect the stability of nh2br as comprehensively depicted in numerous studies lei et al 2004 luh and mariñas 2014 wahman et al 2017 however they were not introduced in eq 1 due to their negligible contribution compared to self decomposition and reaction with cu ii table s1 and fig s12 since nh2br accounted for 90 of the bromamines nh2br was used to model the system the rate law for the decomposition of bromamines mainly nh2br in the presence of cu ii at ph 7 5 may be expressed as follows 1 d nh2br dt k0 nh2br 2 kapp nh2br cu ii where k 0 represents the second order rate constant for nh2br self decomposition and k app represents the second order rate constant for cu ii induced nh2br decomposition the rate constant k app was obtained from the slope of k obs versus cu ii concentration and found to be 2 31 0 01 m 1s 1 fig 3b the calculated rate constants were used to simulate the decomposition of bromamines both with and without the presence of cu ii the modelling results are in good agreement with experimental data for the decomposition of bromamines in the presence of cu ii at ph 7 5 fig 3a 3 3 effect of ph on the decomposition of bromamines the decomposition of bromamines in the absence and presence of 2 0 mg l cu ii for different values of ph between 6 0 and 8 5 are shown in fig 4 the decay of bromamines in the absence of cu ii decreased from 45 9 to 12 4 after 3 h when the ph was increased from 6 0 to 8 5 fig s13a in the presence of cu ii the decay of bromamines is relatively similar for all phs with 54 4 52 7 57 7 and 53 5 decomposition of the initial concentration at ph 6 0 7 0 8 0 and 8 5 after 3 h respectively fig s13b however cu ii induced bromamines decomposition i e the difference between the self decomposition of bromamines and cu ii induced bromamines decomposition increased with increasing ph fig 4 an additional experiment was carried out with a 20 molar excess of ammonia at ph 8 5 to mimic the lower limit for nh4cl br molar ratio as shown in fig s14 the decay of bromamines was already significant in the absence of cu ii and became faster in the presence of 2 0 mg l of cu ii this indicates that under low nh4cl br molar ratio the self decomposition of bromamines is likely to be predominant compared to the reaction with copper however the impact of copper is still significant under these conditions in order to calculate cu ii induced first order rate constant for the decomposition of bromamines k cu ii the first order rate constant for the self decomposition of bromamines k 0 was subtracted from the first order rate constant for the decomposition of bromamines in the presence of 2 mg l cu ii k obs pseudo first order linearization was used for both experiments with and without the presence of cu ii fig s15 the pseudo first order rate constant for the self decomposition of bromamines increased from 1 17 10 5 s 1 to 6 00 10 5 s 1 at ph 8 5 and 6 0 respectively this ph related trend is consistent with the previous study conducted by lei et al 2004 the calculated cu ii induced first order rate constants for the decomposition of bromamines are presented in fig 5 similar to the oxidation of manganese by bromine allard et al 2013 the ph dependency of k cu ii can be explained by the speciation of cu ii and the speciation of the bromamines monobromamine 97 was the dominant bromamine species at ph 8 5 whereas dibromamine 62 was dominant at ph 6 0 fig s8 the distribution of cu ii species is also dependant on ph fig s16 the species specific rate constants were determined according to equation 2 2 k cu ii α c u 2 k c u 2 n h 2 br α n h 2 br k c u 2 nhb r 2 α nhb r 2 α cu oh k cu oh n h 2 br α n h 2 br k cu oh nhb r 2 α nhb r 2 α cu oh 2 k cu oh 2 n h 2 br α n h 2 br k cu oh 2 nhb r 2 α nhb r 2 where α c u 2 α cu oh and α cu oh 2 represent the fraction of cu2 cu oh and cu oh 2 for example α c u 2 cu2 cu 2 tot with cu2 tot cu2 cu oh cu oh 2 similarly α n h 2 br and α nhb r 2 represent the fraction of nh2br and nhbr2 respectively values of k c u 2 n h 2 br k c u 2 nhb r 2 k cu oh n h 2 br k cu oh nhb r 2 k cu oh 2 n h 2 br and k cu oh 2 nhb r 2 represent the species specific second order rate constant bromamines speciation i e the initial ratio of nh2br and nhbr2 at different values of ph were determined by using a kinetic model developed in a previous study fig s17 allard et al 2018 while the speciation of copper could be calculated by using the pka values of 7 4 for cu2 cu oh and 8 6 for cu oh cu oh 2 fig s16 the species specific rate constants were determined via nonlinear least square regression analyses using sigmaplot the procedure used for calculating the species specific rate constants using sigmaplot are presented in fig s18 the values of k c u 2 nhb r 2 k cu oh nhb r 2 k cu oh 2 n h 2 br and k cu oh 2 nhb r 2 were determined to be 1 33 0 40 10 5 m 1s 1 2 78 0 20 10 4 m 1s 1 6 25 1 68 10 5 m 1s 1 and 1 29 0 25 10 3 m 1s 1 respectively while k c u 2 n h 2 br and k cu oh n h 2 br were found negligible using these calculated species specific second order rate constants the model fitting shown in fig 5 black line for ph ranging from 6 to 8 5 demonstrates that eq 2 describes the k cu ii well nh2br was solely reactive with cu oh 2 as cu oh 2 is a stronger nucleophile than either cu2 or cu oh and it is also more reactive towards the electrophiles nh2br and nhbr2 as expected nhbr2 reactivity with the different copper species is higher than nh2br since it is more electrophilic due to the presence of two bromine atoms the reactivity of nhbr2 is also dominated by the hydroxo species cu oh and cu oh 2 3 4 products from the decomposition of bromamines it was verified by using a previously published ionic chromatography method salhi and von gunten 1999 that bromate was not formed during the decomposition of bromamines in the presence of cu ii therefore bromine in bromamines is fully reduced to bromide the loss of bromamines and the production of n2 n2o no2 and no3 for the decomposition of bromamines in the presence and absence of cu ii after 52 h reaction time at ph 9 2 are shown in fig 6 the nitrogen decay products n2 n2o no2 and no3 provide direct evidence of the mechanism of the reaction between monobromamine and cu ii by comparing the distribution of products in the presence and absence of cu ii it is possible to gain insight into the pathways for the decay of bromamines the percentage recoveries in mole of the different nitrogen species are presented in table s2 in the absence of cu ii the total nitrogen recovery for nh2br self decomposition was 109 2 similar to nh2cl decomposition in pure water system vikesland et al 1998 n2 was the primary nitrogen decay product accounting for 76 5 while n2o no2 and no3 were measured at low concentrations with 11 6 15 2 and 6 0 of total nitrogen respectively fig 6 and table s2 in the presence of cu ii the distribution of nitrogen containing degradation products changed the addition of cu ii led to a significant reduction in the formation of n2 the formation of n2 only accounted for 11 6 6 6 and 6 0 of the total nitrogen in the presence of 1 0 mg l 2 0 mg l and 5 0 mg l of cu ii respectively it was found that n2o and no2 were the major products during the cu ii induced decomposition of bromamines representing a much higher proportion of the total nitrogen than in the self decomposition of bromamines interestingly n2o formation increased while no2 formation decreased with increasing cu ii concentrations in the presence of 1 0 mg l cu ii n2o represented 29 5 and no2 51 8 of total nitrogen conversely n2o accounted for 48 1 and no2 for 24 0 of total nitrogen in the presence of 5 0 mg l cu ii fig s19a shows the initial stage 1 h of n2o production monitored by mims confirming the enhanced n2o formation with increasing cu ii concentrations no3 was formed at low concentrations in all conditions studied overall the total nitrogen recoveries in the presence of cu ii ranged from 98 to 80 for 1 0 to 5 0 mg l cu ii respectively it may be hypothesized that other nitrogen decay products may have formed in the presence of cu ii such as nh4 and no2 fig s19b shows the mims response for an m z value of 47 which corresponds to the mass of 15no2 the no2 concentration increased with increasing cu ii concentrations therefore it may be one of the missing nitrogen decay products however no2 is expected to be present at low concentration as it rapidly undergoes dimerization to form nitrite and nitrate huie 1994 3 5 proposed reaction mechanism in order to elucidate the different reaction pathways involved in the decomposition of bromamines by cu ii xps was used to investigate the change in oxidation state during copper reaction with bromamines fig s20 compares the xps spectra of a cucl2 s standard and the copper particles collected after reaction with bromamines the cu 2p of the cucl2 standard showed that it had two peaks at binding energy of 934 8 ev and 954 5 ev similar to that of 934 6 ev and 954 4 ev of cucl2 reported in the literature van der laan et al 1981 it was found that the copper particle sample presented two peaks at binding energy of 931 7 ev and 951 5 ev the cucl s standard has peaks at similar binding energy 932 2 ev and 952 1 ev robert and offergeld 1972 indicating that cu i was produced in the reaction based on the copper species produced the formation of degradation products observed in the previous section and according to the literature the following reaction mechanism for monobromamine decomposition in the presence of cu ii is proposed in scheme 1 at ph 9 2 monobromamine is the dominant bromamines species therefore only monobromamine is described in the reaction mechanism even though there is no direct evidence of the presence of radicals it is hypothesised that similar to the mechanism of nh2cl and h2o2 decay in the presence of cu ii fu et al 2009b lee et al 2014 cu ii is reduced to cu i via a one electron transfer reaction and produces a nhbr radical 3 cu i is oxidised to cu ii by nh2br forming an amine radical nh2 and bromide 4 this confirms the catalytic behaviour of cu ii allowing the use of pseudo first order conditions to determine rate constants once nh2 is formed it quickly reacts with o2 and forms an intermediate peroxyl radical nh2o2 5 clarke et al 2008 laszlo et al 1998 thereafter nh2o2 is decomposed in two parallel reaction pathways pathway 1 leads to the formation of no and h2o laszlo et al 1998 the no is not a stable product and is oxidized to nitrite in the presence of o2 ignarro et al 1993 or leads to the formation of no2 as evidenced by mims 6 and 7 in pathways 2 two nh2o2 are reacting which leads to a formation of two hno and one h2o2 the formed hno decays rapidly to n2o and h2o 10 bazylinski and hollocher 1985 schreiber and mitch 2007 this is consistent with our findings fig 6 i e the two main byproducts no2 and n2o are in competition since one is coming from pathway 1 and the other one from pathway 2 the formation of no3 is coming from no2 oxidation by monobromamine or no2 dissolution in water 8 and 9 similar to nh2 it is hypothesised that nhbr radical reacts with o2 to produce a peroxyl radical nhbro2 that further degrades and forms n2o and no2 as the major end products 4 conclusions and environmental implications in real chloraminated water distribution systems the formation of nitrite from the decomposition of bromamines in the presence of cu ii indicates that nitrification of ammonia by oxidising bacteria may not be the only source of nitrite where cu ii and bromide are present this may help to understand the nitrogen balance of halamine reactions in chloraminated water distribution systems on one hand copper may be used as a biocide to avoid nitrification but on the other hand in the presence of bromide it induces the purely chemical formation of nitrite the kinetic product and mechanistic information for the reaction of bromamines with copper described in this study are very important to obtain a more quantitative understanding of the fates of nitrogen and bromine species in chloraminated distribution systems however more information is needed to comprehensively describe the chemistry in a distribution system containing a mixture of halamines nh2cl nhcl2 nhbrcl nh2br nhbr2 and copper and to thoroughly discuss practical implications based on kinetic modelling this work also has implication for br dbps management it has been demonstrated that nh2br and nhbr2 have a higher potential to produce disinfection by products dbps in comparison to nh2cl heeb et al 2017 lei et al 2006 pope and speitel 2008 simon et al 2015 our results indicates that bromamines is catalytically degraded in presence of copper therefore there will be a competition between copper and nom for reaction with bromamines which may lead to the lower formation of br dbps overall the improved understanding on the stability and decay of bromamines in the presence of copper will allow a better management of potentially toxic br dbps formation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

16496,the global distribution and environmental persistence of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas has been considered a critical environmental concern in this work we successfully fabricated a graphene oxide titanium dioxide gotio2 photoelectrode for perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos degradation in a photoelectrochemical pec system the results reveal that a 5 wt gotio2 anode possesses the optimal pec performance with a band gap eg of 2 42 ev specific surface area sbet of 72 6 m2 g 1 and specific capacitance cs of 4 63 mf cm 2 in the pec system pfos can be efficiently removed within 4 h of reaction time with a pseudo first order rate constant of 0 0124 min 1 under the optimized conditions of current density 20 ma cm 2 electrode distance 5 mm solution ph 5 64 pfos 0 0 5 µm and naclo4 electrolyte concentration 50 mm the electron transfer pathway hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals are all responsible for pfos decomposition transformation new degradation pathways were identified a total of 25 pfos byproducts are reported in this work and perfluoroalkane sulfonates pfsas perfluorinated aldehydes pfals and hydrofluorocarbons hfcs were identified for the first time pfos degradation involves the desulfonation pathway as the first step followed by oxidation and subsequent defluorination decarboxylation decarbonylation sulfonation defluorination and hydroxylation the results from this work also show that the reactivity of pfaas is related to their carbon chain length with shorter chain pfaas exhibiting a lower degradation rate in a pfaa mixture a decline in the degradation rate was observed for the shorter chain length pfaas suggesting stronger competitive inhibition and indicating stronger environmental recalcitrance during the treatment process novelty statement although many efforts have been made to identify perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos degradation byproducts previous studies were only able to identify byproducts that are related to perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas this is the first study to elucidate the new pfos degradation pathway furthermore this is the first report to identify byproducts containing sulfonate groups perfluoroalkane sulfonates pfsas aldehyde groups perfluorinated aldehydes pfals and hydrofluorocarbons hfcs this study further systematically explores how perfluoroalkyl acid pfaa degradation may be affected in the mixture system shorter chain length pfaas suffer stronger competitive inhibition in the photoelectrochemical pec system by utilizing the graphene oxide titanium dioxide gotio2 photoelectrode fabricated in this work pfos can be successfully decomposed during the pec process for the first time graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords photoelectrochemical pfos reactive oxygen species byproducts and reaction pathways competitive inhibition 1 introduction since the 1950s perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas have been broadly used in industrial and domestic applications due to their special physicochemical properties such as chemical and thermal stability water and lipid repellence and high surface activity lehmler 2005 zhang et al 2013 despite offering many advantages pfaas possess the characteristics of widespread occurrence environmental persistence and toxicity making them a critical environmental issue worldwide hu et al 2016b perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos was listed as a persistent organic pollutant pop at the stockholm convention in 2009 wang et al 2009 in the unregulated contaminant monitoring rule ucmr3 database established by the united states environmental protection agency usepa the lifetime health advisory for combined pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in drinking water is 70 ng l 1 hu et al 2016b hurley et al 2016 the conventional wastewater treatment process cannot efficiently remove pfos which results in its ubiquitous occurrence in aquatic environments in countries worldwide dhangar and kumar 2021 lin et al 2010 for instance the maximum detected concentration of pfos in surface water was in the range of 4 6 2709 ng l 1 in china japan india spain and germany llorca et al 2012 yao et al 2014 yeung et al 2009 zushi et al 2011 pfos has also been monitored in groundwater at concentrations of 60 9 18 000 ng l 1 in taiwan the usa and europe bräunig et al 2017 lin et al 2015 loos et al 2010 furthermore pfos residues have been observed in tap water in numerous countries with a maximum concentration of 11 ng l harada et al 2003 mak et al 2009 rostkowski et al 2008 the widespread distribution and persistent nature of pfos prompt us to develop efficient treatment technology for removing pfos traditional physical chemical and biological processes cannot achieve complete pfos degradation due to the strength of carbon fluorine bonds c f 530 kj mol 1 key et al 1997 although thermal treatment and advanced oxidation processes such as alkaline ozonation and photocatalytic reaction may efficiently remove pfos jin et al 2014 lin et al 2012 these processes require stringent experimental conditions e g high temperatures high ph levels and long reaction times the sonochemical process has been reported to provide efficient pfos decomposition and mineralization however high energy input is needed compared with the above treatment processes electrochemical ec methods possess high reaction rates strong oxidation performance and environmental compatibility and can be performed under mild conditions moriwaki et al 2005 in ec methods titanium dioxide tio2 is an attractive electrode material due to its good photocatalytic activity schaefer et al 2015 zhuo et al 2016 to mitigate the fast electron hole recombination of the photocatalyst graphene oxide go has been utilized as the loading material go with a high surface area has high conductivity and exhibits efficient electron transfer thus enhancing the electrocatalytic activity baig et al 2019 hunge et al 2020 recent studies have also applied photoirradiation in the ec process the combination of photochemical pc and ec oxidation processes namely the pec process has been reported to facilitate synergistic effects and can efficiently decompose various contaminants peng et al 2021 and ding et al 2010 noted that the removal rates of ibuprofen and benzotriazole were significantly enhanced via the pec process compared with the ec and pc processes alone recently yang et al 2020 explored pfoa degradation in a pec system and observed that hydroxyl radicals reactive chlorine species and electron transfer pathways were involved in pfoa degradation very limited research is available on application of the pec treatment for pfos removal until now the associated degradation mechanism also requires in depth elucidation during pfos treatment pfos decomposes transforms into various byproducts the formation of short chain length perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas via pfos decomposition has been previously reported duan et al 2020 jin et al 2014 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 however owing to the complex mechanism and reactive species involvement via advanced oxidation processes the transformation byproducts may be more than simple short chain pfcas and warrant further exploration in addition in actual aquatic environments in addition to pfos and pfoa other pfaas also exist the coexistence of these pfaas could possibly lead to their competitive inhibition in the treatment system however most of the existing literature has focused on the removal of a single pfaa and only a very few studies have investigated the degradation and competition behavior of a pfaa mixture a recent study conducted by wang et al 2020 explored the simultaneous ec treatment of eight pfaas noting that the competitive inhibition behavior of each pfaa may be related to its carbon chain length overall information regarding the competitive inhibition between different pfaas including perfluoroalkane sulfonates pfsas and pfcas in a mixture system is still lacking to date no information has been reported regarding the generation of transformation byproducts containing sulfonate groups aldehyde groups and hydrofluorocarbon compounds during pfos decomposition to the authors knowledge this study is the first to provide an in depth understanding of the pfos transformation byproducts pathways and competitive inhibition behaviors among pfaas with different chain lengths by utilizing fabricated gotio2 as a photoelectrode the pfos degradation kinetics participation of reactive species such as oh o2 and electron transfer in the pec system were investigated as were the associated changes in toxicity this work is the first to reveal that pfos byproducts include not only pfcas but also pfsas perfluorinated aldehydes pfals and hydrofluorocarbons hfcs the reactivities of pfaas with different chain lengths in the mixture system were also thoroughly elucidated the results acquired in this study aid in comprehensively understanding the degradation and fate of pfaa cocktails during wastewater treatment 2 materials and experimental methods 2 1 chemicals perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa c8

information on the hplc dad conditions is provided in text s2 to understand the changes in toxicity during the pec degradation of pfos a toxicity assessment was performed using a microtox model 500 acute toxicity analyzer microbics corp carlsbad ca usa which functions based on the measurement of the reduction in luminescence emitted by the marine microorganism vibrio fischeri samples were collected out from the pec reactor after specific time intervals and were adjusted to ph 7 0 prior to the toxicity test subsequently the samples were subjected to appropriate treatments including dilution and salinity adjustment and were then spiked into a vibrio fischeri bacterial suspension the prepared solutions for toxicity measurement contained 1 nacl 1 bacterial and samples at 5 63 11 25 22 5 and 45 the changes in luminescence intensity emitted by vibrio fischeri in the as prepared solutions were recorded after 5 and 15 min of exposure and compared with those of the toxin free control all toxicity tests were conducted at a temperature of 15 c the toxicity value is expressed as toxicity units tu where tu 100 ec50 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization and electrochemical performance prior to the pfos degradation experiments the fabricated gotio2 material was comprehensively characterized to fully determine its physicochemical and electrochemical properties xrd was utilized to identify the crystal structure and phase formation of the synthesized material fig 1 a shows the xrd patterns of go tio2 and gotio2 nanocomposites obtained with various amounts of added go the weight ratios of go are 0 5 wt the go samples show an xrd peak of 2θ at 10 confirming the reflection of the 0 0 2 peak of go the tio2 component p25 was anatase and rutile the tetragonal anatase phase of tio2 shows an xrd pattern of 2θ at 25 38 and 48 which can be indexed to the 1 0 1 0 0 4 and 2 0 0 planes respectively the tetragonal rutile phase peak of 2θ at 27 can be indexed to the 110 plane in addition the typical diffraction peak of go was not observed in the gotio2 patterns which was probably because of poor ordering in the stacked sheets khannam et al 2016 or the addition of small amounts of go on the other hand the elemental composition of gotio2 was determined by energy dispersive spectroscopy eds and is presented in fig 1b the results confirmed the presence of the elements carbon oxygen and titanium in the gotio2 nanocomposites with the carbon content increasing from 9 77 to 13 28 by the addition of 5 wt go xps analyses were conducted to identify the functional groups and chemical composition in go tio2 and gotio2 fig 1c shows the full scale xps survey spectrum it indicates peaks with binding energies of 295 280 ev 545 525 ev and 472 447 ev which refer to the c 1s o 1s and ti 2p orbitals fig 1d shows the c 1 s spectrum in which four peaks are observed at 284 8 ev 286 4 ev 288 8 ev and 287 ev which represent the c c bond c o c bond o c o bond and c o bond respectively this is consistent with the results of hunge et al 2020 regarding the o 1 s orbital in the xps pattern fig 1e only one peak appears at 533 8 ev which can be ascribed to the o c bond while the o ti bond o h bond and o c bond appeared in tio2 and the gotio2 composite with binding energies of 530 ev 532 2 ev and 533 8 ev respectively additionally the ti 2p spectrum is shown in fig s3 binding energies of 458 3 ev and 464 ev are observed and are attributed to ti 2p3 2 and ti 2p1 2 in the anatase phase of tio2 respectively showing that ti is mainly present as ti4 in tio2 and gotio2 tian et al 2013 the morphology and crystallinity of gotio2 were investigated by sem and tem analysis the micrograph of the go is presented in fig 2 a and d in which a single layer of go rugose sheets is easily visible in the tio2 images fig 2b and e we can observe the typical spherical shape of tio2 nanoparticle aggregates on the other hand the images of gotio2 are shown in fig 2c and f 5 wt gotio2 and fig s4 0 25 1 and 2 5 wt gotio2 when only 0 25 wt go was added only a small piece of the go rugose sheets covered the surface of the tio2 nanoparticles due to insufficient go addition while most tio2 nanoparticles were present as agglomerates on go sheets however when the addition amount of go increased to 1 2 5 and 5 wt tio2 nanoparticles were more homogeneously dispersed on the go layers this homogeneous dispersion may be the reason behind the increased electrochemical performance of the gotio2 photoelectrode the uv vis spectroscopy results of the synthesized gotio2 are provided in fig 3 a the results show that the absorption edge of gotio2 redshifts towards higher wavelengths in the absorption region with varying amounts of go addition by using the photon energy equation eg 1240 λ the optical band gap eg was calculated from the absorption edge as shown in fig 3b a tendency was observed that the band gap energy of gotio2 decreased with increasing go addition the increase in the go amount would also enhance the conductivity by reducing the recombination rate of electron hole pairs lv et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 zhu et al 2010 which would contribute to better catalytic activity to explore the surface characteristics of gotio2 the specific surface area sbet was investigated by bet isotherm measurements the results of sbet pore volume pore size and particle size are presented in fig 3c and table s6 by analysis the sbet and pore volume of gotio2 obviously increased from 51 1 to 72 6 m2 g 1 and from 0 35 to 0 41 cm3 g 1 with increasing go addition respectively simultaneously the pore size and the particle size decreased this results in the better electrochemical capacitance of the gotio2 photoelectrode liu et al 2018 the specific capacitance cs of the photoelectrode can be calculated from the cyclic voltammetry curves according to the following equation wang et al 2012 yang et al 2016 1 c s 1 a υ δ v i v d v where a cm2 is the working area of the photoelectrode υ mv s 1 is the scan rate δv v is the sweep potential window and the integrated area under the c v curve and i v is the response current according to eq 1 the specific capacitance values of gotio2 photoelectrodes are obtained fig 3d shows the c v characteristic curves of gotio2 obtained with various amounts of go addition under uv irradiation the results show that when go addition was increased from 0 to 5 wt the specific capacitance increased from 0 159 to 4 63 mf cm 2 table s6 indicating that a higher go amount in the gotio2 electrode contributed to better electrochemical characteristics furthermore fig s5 shows the c v characteristic curves of the 5 wt gotio2 photoelectrode under uv irradiation at various scan rates all of the cyclic voltammetry curves were rectangular in shape indicating ideal capacitive properties and the current intensity of this photoelectrode was independent of the potential energy the specific capacitance of the gotio2 photoelectrode has a close relationship with the specific surface area namely the specific surface area plays a major role in determining the specific capacitance summarizing the above analytical results from xrd xps sem tem uv vis bet and cs gotio2 was successfully fabricated its improved properties result in the enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of gotio2 3 2 photoelectrochemical degradation of pfos 3 2 1 influences of operational factors on pfos removal the photoelectrochemical performance of the gotio2 electrode was evaluated by the degradation of pfos under five treatment processes namely direct photolysis photocatalysis pc ec and pec processes and the results are shown in fig 4 a detailed information on the pfos degradation efficiencies η and rate constants k is presented in table s7 among all five processes the pec treatment possessed the best degradation efficiency in pfos degradation while no pfos degradation was observed in the background experiments i e direct photolysis photocatalysis and pc processes the results showed that the degradation of pfos followed pseudo first order kinetics in the pec and ec processes the pfos removal reached 94 83 and 75 in the pec and ec processes respectively within 240 min of reaction time the associated k values were 0 0124 and 0 0065 min 1 respectively our results revealed a synergistic effect on the photoassisted ec degradation of pfos a detailed explanation of the synergistic mechanism of the enhancement of pfos degradation is provided in section 3 3 1 similar phenomena were observed in other studies xu et al 2020 peng et al 2017 and zhao et al 2009 investigated the degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid pfoa and ibuprofen and found that the removal efficiency in the pec process was higher than that in the ec process fig 4b shows the influences of various operational factors including current density electrode distance solution ph pfos concentration and electrolyte concentration on the pfos removal efficiency by the pec process the applied potential voltage plays an important role in the pec process the red line in fig 4b shows that the increase in current density from 2 to 20 ma cm 2 was associated with an increase in the k value from 0 0003 min 1 to 0 0124 min 1 the enhancement of the applied potential could result in a decrease in recombination between holes and electrons and thus enhance the electrochemical performance peng et al 2017 zhao and zhu 2006 the alteration in electrode distance has an impact on the electron transport behavior and electric resistance and thus affects the current efficiency in our results blue line in fig 4b the best pfos degradation occurred with an electrode distance of 5 mm an increase in the electrode distance from 5 to 20 mm led to a decrease in pfos degradation efficiency the k values decreased from 0 0124 min 1 to 0 0029 min 1 a higher electrode distance led to a reduction in the electron diffusion efficiency thereby decreasing the pfos degradation efficiency duan et al 2018 hu et al 2016a ma et al 2015 accordingly in the following experiments 5 mm was selected as the optimal electrode distance the solution ph was also a significant factor in the pec process the optimal pfos degradation rate occurred under acidic solution ph conditions i e ph 3 as shown in fig 4b yellow line because pfos has a pka value of 3 27 brooke et al 2004 at the ph values studied in this work ph 3 11 pfos mainly exists in its anionic form f cf2 8so3 hence negatively charged pfos will have favorable affinity for the photoanode subsequently leading to its degradation however at alkaline ph values the pfos degradation rate was reduced with increasing ph the concentration of oh increased which led to competition between the pfos anion and oh for the sorption sites on the anode zhuo et al 2020 thereby leading to the lowest pfos removal at ph 11 zhuo et al 2020 investigated the ec treatment of f 53b which is a pfos substitute and observed that a lower compound degradation rate occurred under alkaline ph conditions since pfos exists in a wide range of concentrations in aquatic environments lin et al 2010 lin et al 2009 it is meaningful to investigate the influence of the initial pfos concentration on the degradation efficiency in the pec system the result the green line in fig 4b shows that a lower initial pfos concentration facilitates its degradation when the pfos concentration decreases from 10 to 0 5 μm the k values increase from 0 0021 to 0 0124 min 1 since the amount of pfos treatment per unit time was constant under the conditions of the pec system an increase in the initial concentration of pfos led to a reduction in the pfos degradation efficiency duan et al 2018 the electrolyte concentration was varied to study its effects on pfos degradation as shown in fig 4b purple line the pfos degradation k values increase from 0 0032 to 0 0124 min 1 with increasing electrolyte concentration from 10 to 50 mm however for increasing electrolyte concentrations from 50 to 100 mm no influence of electrolyte concentration on the rate of pfos removal was observed during the pec process enough ions in the system were required to promote electron transfer and facilitate the pec reaction while at lower electrolyte concentrations the abundance of ions was insufficient thereby leading to a reduction in the pfos degradation rate this phenomenon was consistent with the literature li et al 2009 song et al 2010 thus a 50 mm electrolyte sodium perchlorate was used in this study 3 2 2 pfos degradation mechanism in the pec process in the pec system with sodium perchlorate as the electrolyte multiple radical chain reactions occurred and several reactive oxygen species ros were generated as follows liu et al 2019 muruganandham and swaminathan 2004 2 oh oh e 3 h2o oh h e 4 2 oh h2o2 5 h2o2 hν 2 oh 6 h2o2 o2 2h 2e 7 o2 e o2 eqs 2 and 3 show the hydroxyl radical oh generated on the surface of the gotio2 photoelectrode through an electron transfer reaction eq 4 shows the production of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 from the oh self recombination reaction simultaneously h2o2 will also absorb uv light and transform into oh eqs 5 in addition h2o2 will be oxidized into o2 which further reacts with electrons to generate superoxide radicals o2 eqs 6 and 7 to elucidate the participation of reactive species in pfos degradation in the pec system scavenger experiments and probe tests were performed scavengers including benzoic acid p benzoquinone and potassium iodide each of 30 mm were utilized and individually spiked into the solutions benzoic acid and p benzoquinone can scavenge oh and o2 with reaction rate constants of 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 chen et al 2003 zrinyi and pham 2017 and 9 109 m 1 s 1 greenstock and miller 1975 palominos et al 2009 respectively the results in fig 4c show that the presence of benzoic acid and p benzoquinone led to the inhibition of pfos degradation among the two scavengers p benzoquinone suppressed pfos degradation to a larger extent the degradation rate decreased from 94 83 to 79 99 and 56 23 by the addition of benzoic acid and p benzoquinone respectively this implied the involvement of oh and o2 in the degradation of pfos in which o2 played a relatively important role the abundances of oh and o2 were further measured using the probe reagents nitrobenzene and hydroquinone each at 5 μm respectively fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 it was observed that the estimated concentrations of o2 and oh were 1 31 10 4 μm and 5 49 10 7 μm respectively detailed calculations of oh and o2 are provided in text s3 the steady state concentration of o2 in the pec system was significantly higher x223c 240 times than that of oh this result corresponded with the observation from the scavenger experiments which noted the predominant role of o2 in pfos degradation compared with that of oh on the other hand we observed that iodide anion i spiking resulted in significant inhibition of pfos degradation the η values decreased from 94 83 to 46 56 fig 4c the i present can compete with existing anions in the solution e g pfos anion and oh for sorption onto the gotio2 photoelectrode surface and further inhibit the electron transfer reaction contributed by the pfos anion and oh fang et al 2013 wang and zhang 2011 thus inhibition by i addition suggested that the electron transfer pathway also participated in pfos degradation overall the above results demonstrated that oh o2 and electron transfer reactions were all responsible for pfos degradation during the pec process 3 3 pfos transformation byproducts and pathways of the pec process during the pec reaction pfos undergoes various degradation pathways and is further transformed into various byproducts to fully explore the overall transformation pathway and elucidate the detailed reaction mechanism this study not only used pfos but also separately utilized eight main byproducts pfoa pfhpa pfhxa pfpea pfba pfpra pfhxs and pfbs which were detected during pfos degradation as the target pollutants to conduct the pec reaction the results in fig 5 a and b i represent pfos and its 8 main byproducts of degradation transformation via the pec reaction respectively the dotted lines represent the degradation of target pollutants formation of f and so4 2 which correspond to the left y axis and the solid lines with solid symbols and the open symbols represent the byproduct evolution corresponding to the byproducts nm and peak area 104 on the right y axis respectively in this work a total of 25 pfos transformation byproducts were observed detailed tof ms ms spectrometry parameter information on the 25 detected byproducts is presented in table s4 and the mass spectra and structures of the product ions scanned are shown in fig s1 these byproducts can be categorized into five groups including 5 pfsas 6 pfcas 5 pfals 4 hfcs and 5 others notably the byproduct pfsas p9 and p15 pfals and hfcs were identified for the first time on the other hand the results in most of the figures in fig 5 revealed that the transformation byproducts with different carbon chain lengths possess distinct degradation efficiencies the concentration of the long chain byproducts first increases and then decreases while the concentration of shorter chain byproducts continuously increases with time furthermore among the degradation of all studied pfaa target compounds the dotted line in fig 5 it was observed that pfaas with longer chain lengths have a higher degradation rate than pfaas with shorter chain lengths the relationship between carbon chain length and pfaa reactivity is discussed further in section 3 4 based on the identified byproduct information in this work and other relevant studies on pfos degradation duan et al 2020 shi et al 2019 the mechanism and pathway of pfos transformation in the pec system were proposed as shown in fig 6 initially pfos is transformed to pfos radicals through direct electron transfer on the surface of the gotio2 photoelectrode eq 8 then this radical is desulfonated to form c8f17 and sulfur trioxide so3 eq 9 after desulfonation c8f17 reacts with oh to generate the unstable alcohol c8f17oh eq 10 c8f17oh rapidly decomposed into c7f15cof with f release eqs 10 and 11 subsequently c7f15cof underwent a hydrolysis reaction and generated c7f15coo pfoa c8 and c7f15c o with the release of another f eq 12 through electron transfer and subsequent decarboxylation or decarbonylation pfoa and c7f15c o were further converted to c7f15 eqs 13 and 14 c7f15 and other shorter chain length cnf2n 1 n 3 6 underwent further reactions and transformed into c7f13h and other hfcs eq 15 on the other hand c7f15 also reacted with so3 generated from the electron transfer reaction of so3 and formed c7f15so3 pfsas c7 eqs 16 and 17 stepwise pfos was gradually decomposed into short chain pfaas and finally mineralized into co2 so4 2 and f on the other hand pfos also underwent defluorination and hydroxylation pathways of which p5 and p14 were the defluorinated byproducts while p4 was the hydroxylated byproduct additionally regarding the transformation trend of the hydroxylated byproduct p4 we observed that most of its concentrations continuously increased or reached a plateau fig 5 implying that it was recalcitrant and generated at the later stage of pfos transformation in summary the complete pfos degradation pathways include a desulfonation b oxidation followed by defluorination c decarboxylation d decarbonylation e sulfonation f defluorination and g hydroxylation the transformation byproducts include pfcas cnf2 1c o oh n 2 7 pfsas cmf2m 1so3h m 3 7 pfals cpf2p 1c o h p 3 6 hfcs cqf2q 1h q 3 7 and others p3 5 p8 and p14 however given that the authentic standards of some of the byproducts e g pfals and hfcs were not acquired in this work the production yields among all types of byproducts as well as the contribution of each transformation pathway could not be comprehensively elucidated compared further investigation is required 8 c8f17so3 c8f17so3 e 9 c8f17so3 c8f17 so3 10 c8f17 oh

c7f15so3 3 3 1 comparison of the pfos degradation mechanisms between ec and pec processes the transformation byproduct generation in the ec system was also elucidated as shown in fig s6 to facilitate better understanding the photo electro synergistic mechanism comparing the results in figs 5a and s6 despite the similarity of the types of transformation byproducts observed between the ec and pec systems their transformation trends were distinctly different during the pec process the byproducts were continuously generated and further degraded over time while most of the byproducts in the ec system were slowly and continuously formed the detected trends of the parent compound pfos as well as the associated byproducts in the two systems revealed that not only a faster pfos degradation rate but also a rapid byproduct evolution profile occurred in the pec process this suggested that the applied uv radiation can synergistically benefit the associated pec reactions likely decreasing electron hole recombination and subsequently promoting the electron transfer reaction and reactive species production peng et al 2017 zhao and zhu 2006 thus leading to faster pfos decomposition and byproduct evolution degradation however further elucidation of the detailed synergistic mechanism is still needed 3 3 2 detoxification of pfos during the pec process the generation of byproducts via target compound decomposition leads to a change in toxicity during the treatment process lai et al 2017 yin et al 2018 however to date very few studies have examined the toxicity of pfos byproducts following the application of pec treatment the toxicity behavior during pfos degradation via the pec process is shown in fig s7 the results show that the toxicity gradually increased from 0 13 to 11 89 within the first 6 h during pfos degradation conversely the toxicity decreased from 11 89 to 2 57 after 6 h of reaction on the other hand regarding the results of the ion formation trend during pfos degradation in the pec system fig 5a the concentrations of fluoride and sulfate ions constantly increased over 12 h with significant production yields of 21 2 and 59 2 respectively which suggested the possible decomposition of pfos during the pec process overall according to the comparison of the byproduct transformation and ion formation fig 5a with the toxicity trends pfos was continuously decomposed into small fragment byproducts which possess low toxicity this demonstrated that the pec system developed in this work is a promising treatment process for pfos removal 3 4 the reactivity and competitive inhibition behavior of pfaas in section 3 3 we observed that pfos is transformed into variable chain length pfsa and pfca byproducts which contain sulfonate groups hso3 and carboxylic groups cooh respectively to further explore their reactivity and competitive inhibition behavior the degradation of pfsas and pfcas with different carbon chain lengths in the pec system was examined individually and in a mixture system the detailed observed degradation efficiencies η and rate constants k are provided in table s8 in the individual solution solution containing a single compound the results show that pfsas and pfcas with shorter carbon chains exhibited lower degradation rates the η value decreased in the following order pfos pfhxs pfbs for pfsas pfoa pfhpa pfhxa pfpea pfba pfpra for pfcas as shown in fig 7 a and b this phenomenon was also observed in other studies which indicated that pfaas with shorter carbon chain lengths were more persistent in ec systems niu et al 2012 wang et al 2020 furthermore we compared the relationship between the carbon chain length and degradation efficiency ratio ηmixture ηindividual for different pfaas as shown in fig 7c ηmixture ηindividual represents the degree of competitive inhibition that occurred for each pfaa in the mixture system compared with that in the individual system based on the results we observed that pfaas with longer carbon chain lengths exhibited weaker competitive inhibition behavior for instance pfos is the longest carbon chain pfaa studied in this work its degradation rates in the individual solution and in the mixture solution were very similar the ηmixture ηindividual value is 99 5 nearly 100 suggesting minimal competitive inhibition occurred fig 7a and c however for most of the other studied pfaas except for pfbs pfba and pfpra their degradation rates in the mixture solution were obviously slower than those in the individual solutions fig 7a and b with the ηmixture ηindividual value decreasing greatly with decreasing chain length fig 7c the difference in the competitive inhibition behavior for each pfaa is explained as follows pfaas with longer chain lengths possess greater molecular volumes hence they might have more opportunities to contact the photoanode and undergo further degradation according to table s8 pfos showing the highest ηmixture ηindividual value bears the largest molecular volume 272 1 cm3 mol 1 among the observed pfaas hence resulting in its weakest competitive inhibition behavior it should be noted that the three shorter chain compounds pfbs pfba and pfpra exhibited minimal degradation in the individual solutions their ηindividual values were all 20 thus the calculated ηmixture ηindividual values are relatively high which does not accurately reflect the actual competitive inhibition behavior hence they are excluded from discussion 4 conclusions the decomposition of pfos in a pec system was successfully achieved in this work by utilizing a fabricated gotio2 photoelectrode new insights into the pfos degradation mechanism have also been comprehensively elucidated for the first time the presence of go decreases the optical band gap and increases the surface area of the gotio2 photoelectrode contributing to its higher capacitance and hence leading to better pec performance in pfos degradation with a current density of 20 ma cm 2 electrode distance of 5 mm initial ph of 5 64 pfos 0 of 0 5 μm and naclo4 of 50 mm pfos was completely decomposed in 4 h the scavenger probe experiments showed that pfos degradation is attributed to the electron transfer reaction and oh and o2 attack further leading to its decomposition during the pathways of desulfonation oxidation then defluorination decarboxylation decarbonylation sulfonation defluorination and hydroxylation pfos is transformed into various byproducts including pfsas pfcas pfals hfcs and others further decomposition of pfos leads to its mineralization with the formation of fluoride ions and sulfate ions overall the results provide new insights into pfos degradation pathways which facilitate the comprehensive understanding of its decomposition and transformation in actual aquatic environments regarding the reactivity of pfos pfoa and other pfaas the results from this work demonstrated that the degradation rates of pfaas depend on their carbon chain length pfaas with shorter chain lengths possess lower degradation rates in addition when pfaas coexist greater competitive inhibition behavior was observed for the shorter chain length pfaa considering that these pfaa compound residues exist in mixtures in the real aquatic environment our above results imply that shorter chain length pfaas warrant more attention because they are not only difficult to degrade but also possess greater competitive inhibition behaviors and are thus more recalcitrant to water wastewater treatment processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this study was financially supported by funding

16496,the global distribution and environmental persistence of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas has been considered a critical environmental concern in this work we successfully fabricated a graphene oxide titanium dioxide gotio2 photoelectrode for perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos degradation in a photoelectrochemical pec system the results reveal that a 5 wt gotio2 anode possesses the optimal pec performance with a band gap eg of 2 42 ev specific surface area sbet of 72 6 m2 g 1 and specific capacitance cs of 4 63 mf cm 2 in the pec system pfos can be efficiently removed within 4 h of reaction time with a pseudo first order rate constant of 0 0124 min 1 under the optimized conditions of current density 20 ma cm 2 electrode distance 5 mm solution ph 5 64 pfos 0 0 5 µm and naclo4 electrolyte concentration 50 mm the electron transfer pathway hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals are all responsible for pfos decomposition transformation new degradation pathways were identified a total of 25 pfos byproducts are reported in this work and perfluoroalkane sulfonates pfsas perfluorinated aldehydes pfals and hydrofluorocarbons hfcs were identified for the first time pfos degradation involves the desulfonation pathway as the first step followed by oxidation and subsequent defluorination decarboxylation decarbonylation sulfonation defluorination and hydroxylation the results from this work also show that the reactivity of pfaas is related to their carbon chain length with shorter chain pfaas exhibiting a lower degradation rate in a pfaa mixture a decline in the degradation rate was observed for the shorter chain length pfaas suggesting stronger competitive inhibition and indicating stronger environmental recalcitrance during the treatment process novelty statement although many efforts have been made to identify perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos degradation byproducts previous studies were only able to identify byproducts that are related to perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas this is the first study to elucidate the new pfos degradation pathway furthermore this is the first report to identify byproducts containing sulfonate groups perfluoroalkane sulfonates pfsas aldehyde groups perfluorinated aldehydes pfals and hydrofluorocarbons hfcs this study further systematically explores how perfluoroalkyl acid pfaa degradation may be affected in the mixture system shorter chain length pfaas suffer stronger competitive inhibition in the photoelectrochemical pec system by utilizing the graphene oxide titanium dioxide gotio2 photoelectrode

species byproducts and reaction pathways competitive inhibition 1 introduction since the 1950s perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas have been broadly used in industrial and domestic applications due to their special physicochemical properties such as chemical and thermal stability water and lipid repellence and high surface activity lehmler 2005 zhang et al 2013 despite offering many advantages pfaas possess the characteristics of widespread occurrence environmental persistence and toxicity making them a critical environmental issue worldwide hu et al 2016b perfluorooctane sulfonate pfos was listed as a persistent organic pollutant pop at the stockholm convention in 2009 wang et al 2009 in the unregulated contaminant monitoring rule ucmr3 database established by the united states environmental protection agency usepa the lifetime health advisory for combined pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in drinking water is 70 ng l 1 hu et al 2016b hurley et al 2016 the conventional wastewater treatment process cannot efficiently remove pfos which results in its ubiquitous occurrence in aquatic environments in countries worldwide dhangar and kumar 2021 lin et al 2010 for instance the maximum detected concentration of pfos in surface water was in the range of 4 6 2709 ng l 1 in china japan india spain and germany llorca et al 2012 yao et al 2014 yeung et al 2009 zushi et al 2011 pfos has also been monitored in groundwater at concentrations of 60 9 18 000 ng l 1 in taiwan the usa and europe bräunig et al 2017 lin et al 2015 loos et al 2010 furthermore pfos residues have been observed in tap water in numerous countries with a maximum concentration of 11 ng l harada et al 2003 mak et al 2009 rostkowski et al 2008 the widespread distribution and persistent nature of pfos prompt us to develop efficient treatment technology for removing pfos traditional physical chemical and biological processes cannot achieve complete pfos degradation due to the strength of carbon fluorine bonds c f 530 kj mol 1 key et al 1997 although thermal treatment and advanced oxidation processes such as alkaline ozonation and photocatalytic reaction may efficiently remove pfos jin et al 2014 lin et al 2012 these processes require stringent experimental conditions e g high temperatures high ph levels and long reaction times the sonochemical process has been reported to provide efficient pfos decomposition and mineralization however high energy input is needed compared with the above treatment processes electrochemical ec methods possess high reaction rates strong oxidation performance and environmental compatibility and can be performed under mild conditions moriwaki et al 2005 in ec methods titanium dioxide tio2 is an attractive electrode material due to its good photocatalytic activity schaefer et al 2015 zhuo et al 2016 to mitigate the fast electron hole recombination of the photocatalyst graphene oxide go has been utilized as the loading material go with a high surface area has high conductivity and exhibits efficient electron transfer thus enhancing the electrocatalytic activity baig et al 2019 hunge et al 2020 recent studies have also applied photoirradiation in the ec process the combination of photochemical pc and ec oxidation processes namely the pec process has been reported to facilitate synergistic effects and can efficiently decompose various contaminants peng et al 2021 and ding et al 2010 noted that the removal rates of ibuprofen and benzotriazole were significantly enhanced via the pec process compared with the ec and pc processes alone recently yang et al 2020 explored pfoa degradation in a pec system and observed that hydroxyl radicals reactive chlorine species and electron transfer pathways were involved in pfoa degradation very limited research is available on application of the pec treatment for pfos removal until now the associated degradation mechanism also requires in depth elucidation during pfos treatment pfos decomposes transforms into various byproducts the formation of short chain length perfluorinated carboxylic acids pfcas via pfos decomposition has been previously reported duan et al 2020 jin et al 2014 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2013 however owing to the complex mechanism and reactive species involvement via advanced oxidation processes the transformation byproducts may be more than simple short chain pfcas and warrant further exploration in addition in actual aquatic environments in addition to pfos and pfoa other pfaas also exist the coexistence of these pfaas could possibly lead to their competitive inhibition in the treatment system however most of the existing literature has focused on the removal of a single pfaa and only a very few studies have investigated the degradation and competition behavior of a pfaa mixture a recent study conducted by wang et al 2020 explored the simultaneous ec treatment of eight pfaas noting that the competitive inhibition behavior of each pfaa may be related to its carbon chain length overall information regarding the competitive inhibition between different pfaas including perfluoroalkane sulfonates pfsas and pfcas in a mixture system is still lacking to date no information has been reported regarding the generation of transformation byproducts containing sulfonate groups aldehyde groups and hydrofluorocarbon compounds during pfos decomposition to the authors knowledge this study is the first to provide an in depth understanding of the pfos transformation byproducts pathways and competitive inhibition behaviors among pfaas with different chain lengths by utilizing fabricated gotio2 as a photoelectrode the pfos degradation kinetics participation of reactive species such as oh o2 and electron transfer in the pec system were investigated as were the associated changes in toxicity this work is the first to reveal that pfos byproducts include not only pfcas but also pfsas perfluorinated aldehydes pfals and hydrofluorocarbons hfcs the reactivities of pfaas with different chain lengths in the mixture system were also thoroughly elucidated the results acquired in this study aid in comprehensively understanding the degradation and fate of pfaa cocktails during wastewater treatment 2 materials and experimental methods 2 1 chemicals perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa c8

performance prior to the pfos degradation experiments the fabricated gotio2 material was comprehensively characterized to fully determine its physicochemical and electrochemical properties xrd was utilized to identify the crystal structure and phase formation of the synthesized material fig 1 a shows the xrd patterns of go tio2 and gotio2 nanocomposites obtained with various amounts of added go the weight ratios of go are 0 5 wt the go samples show an xrd peak of 2θ at 10 confirming the reflection of the 0 0 2 peak of go the tio2 component p25 was anatase and rutile the tetragonal anatase phase of tio2 shows an xrd pattern of 2θ at 25 38 and 48 which can be indexed to the 1 0 1 0 0 4 and 2 0 0 planes respectively the tetragonal rutile phase peak of 2θ at 27 can be indexed to the 110 plane in addition the typical diffraction peak of go was not observed in the gotio2 patterns which was probably because of poor ordering in the stacked sheets khannam et al 2016 or the addition of small amounts of go on the other hand the elemental composition of gotio2 was determined by energy dispersive spectroscopy eds and is presented in fig 1b the results confirmed the presence of the elements carbon oxygen and titanium in the gotio2 nanocomposites with the carbon content increasing from 9 77 to 13 28 by the addition of 5 wt go xps analyses were conducted to identify the functional groups and chemical composition in go tio2 and gotio2 fig 1c shows the full scale xps survey spectrum it indicates peaks with binding energies of 295 280 ev 545 525 ev and 472 447 ev which refer to the c 1s o 1s and ti 2p orbitals fig 1d shows the c 1 s spectrum in which four peaks are observed at 284 8 ev 286 4 ev 288 8 ev and 287 ev which represent the c c bond c o c bond o c o bond and c o bond respectively this is consistent with the results of hunge et al 2020 regarding the o 1 s orbital in the xps pattern fig 1e only one peak appears at 533 8 ev which can be ascribed to the o c bond while the o ti bond o h bond and o c bond appeared in tio2 and the gotio2 composite with binding energies of 530 ev 532 2 ev and 533 8 ev respectively additionally the ti 2p spectrum is shown in fig s3 binding energies of 458 3 ev and 464 ev are observed and are attributed to ti 2p3 2 and ti 2p1 2 in the anatase phase of tio2 respectively showing that ti is mainly present as ti4 in tio2 and gotio2 tian et al 2013 the morphology and crystallinity of gotio2 were investigated by sem and tem analysis the micrograph of the go is presented in fig 2 a and d in which a single layer of go rugose sheets is easily visible in the tio2 images fig 2b and e we can observe the typical spherical shape of tio2 nanoparticle aggregates on the other hand the images of gotio2 are shown in fig 2c and f 5 wt gotio2 and fig s4 0 25 1 and 2 5 wt gotio2 when only 0 25 wt go was added only a small piece of the go rugose sheets covered the surface of the tio2 nanoparticles due to insufficient go addition while most tio2 nanoparticles were present as agglomerates on go sheets however when the addition amount of go increased to 1 2 5 and 5 wt tio2 nanoparticles were more homogeneously dispersed on the go layers this homogeneous dispersion may be the reason behind the increased electrochemical performance of the gotio2 photoelectrode the uv vis spectroscopy results of the synthesized gotio2 are provided in fig 3 a the results show that the absorption edge of gotio2 redshifts towards higher wavelengths in the absorption region with varying amounts of go addition by using the photon energy equation eg 1240 λ the optical band gap eg was calculated from the absorption edge as shown in fig 3b a tendency was observed that the band gap energy of gotio2 decreased with increasing go addition the increase in the go amount would also enhance the conductivity by reducing the recombination rate of electron hole pairs lv et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 zhu et al 2010 which would contribute to better catalytic activity to explore the surface characteristics of gotio2 the specific surface area sbet was investigated by bet isotherm measurements the results of sbet pore volume pore size and particle size are presented in fig 3c and table s6 by analysis the sbet and pore volume of gotio2 obviously increased from 51 1 to 72 6 m2 g 1 and from 0 35 to 0 41 cm3 g 1 with increasing go addition respectively simultaneously the pore size and the particle size decreased this results in the better electrochemical capacitance of the gotio2 photoelectrode liu et al 2018 the specific capacitance cs of the photoelectrode can be calculated from the cyclic voltammetry curves according to the following equation wang et al 2012 yang et al 2016 1 c s 1 a υ δ v i v d v where a cm2 is the working area of the photoelectrode υ mv s 1 is the scan rate δv v is the sweep potential window and the integrated area under the c v curve and i v is the response current according to eq 1 the specific capacitance values of gotio2 photoelectrodes are obtained fig 3d shows the c v characteristic curves of gotio2 obtained with various amounts of go addition under uv irradiation the results show that when go addition was increased from 0 to 5 wt the specific capacitance increased from 0 159 to 4 63 mf cm 2 table s6 indicating that a higher go amount in the gotio2 electrode contributed to better electrochemical characteristics furthermore fig s5 shows the c v characteristic curves of the 5 wt gotio2 photoelectrode under uv irradiation at various scan rates all of the cyclic voltammetry curves were rectangular in shape indicating ideal capacitive properties and the current intensity of this photoelectrode was independent of the potential energy the specific capacitance of the gotio2 photoelectrode has a close relationship with the specific surface area namely the specific surface area plays a major role in determining the specific capacitance summarizing the above analytical results from xrd xps sem tem uv vis bet and cs gotio2 was successfully fabricated its improved properties result in the enhanced photoelectrochemical performance of gotio2 3 2 photoelectrochemical degradation of pfos 3 2 1 influences of operational factors on pfos removal the photoelectrochemical performance of the gotio2 electrode was evaluated by the degradation of pfos under five treatment processes namely direct photolysis photocatalysis pc ec and pec processes and the results are shown in fig 4 a detailed information on the pfos degradation efficiencies η and rate constants k is presented in table s7 among all five processes the pec treatment possessed the best degradation efficiency in pfos degradation while no pfos degradation was observed in the background experiments i e direct photolysis photocatalysis and pc processes the results showed that the degradation of pfos followed pseudo first order kinetics in the pec and ec processes the pfos removal reached 94 83 and 75 in the pec and ec processes respectively within 240 min of reaction time the associated k values were 0 0124 and 0 0065 min 1 respectively our results revealed a synergistic effect on the photoassisted ec degradation of pfos a detailed explanation of the synergistic mechanism of the enhancement of pfos degradation is provided in section 3 3 1 similar phenomena were observed in other studies xu et al 2020 peng et al 2017 and zhao et al 2009 investigated the degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid pfoa and ibuprofen and found that the removal efficiency in the pec process was higher than that in the ec process fig 4b shows the influences of various operational factors including current density electrode distance solution ph pfos concentration and electrolyte concentration on the pfos removal efficiency by the pec process the applied potential voltage plays an important role in the pec process the red line in fig 4b shows that the increase in current density from 2 to 20 ma cm 2 was associated with an increase in the k value from 0 0003 min 1 to 0 0124 min 1 the enhancement of the applied potential could result in a decrease in recombination between holes and electrons and thus enhance the electrochemical performance peng et al 2017 zhao and zhu 2006 the alteration in electrode distance has an impact on the electron transport behavior and electric resistance and thus affects the current efficiency in our results blue line in fig 4b the best pfos degradation occurred with an electrode distance of 5 mm an increase in the electrode distance from 5 to 20 mm led to a decrease in pfos degradation efficiency the k values decreased from 0 0124 min 1 to 0 0029 min 1 a higher electrode distance led to a reduction in the electron diffusion efficiency thereby decreasing the pfos degradation efficiency duan et al 2018 hu et al 2016a ma et al 2015 accordingly in the following experiments 5 mm was selected as the optimal electrode distance the solution ph was also a significant factor in the pec process the optimal pfos degradation rate occurred under acidic solution ph conditions i e ph 3 as shown in fig 4b yellow line because pfos has a pka value of 3 27 brooke et al 2004 at the ph values studied in this work ph 3 11 pfos mainly exists in its anionic form f cf2 8so3 hence negatively charged pfos will have favorable affinity for the photoanode subsequently leading to its degradation however at alkaline ph values the pfos degradation rate was reduced with increasing ph the concentration of oh increased which led to competition between the pfos anion and oh for the sorption sites on the anode zhuo et al 2020 thereby leading to the lowest pfos removal at ph 11 zhuo et al 2020 investigated the ec treatment of f 53b which is a pfos substitute and observed that a lower compound degradation rate occurred under alkaline ph conditions since pfos exists in a wide range of concentrations in aquatic environments lin et al 2010 lin et al 2009 it is meaningful to investigate the influence of the initial pfos concentration on the degradation efficiency in the pec system the result the green line in fig 4b shows that a lower initial pfos concentration facilitates its degradation when the pfos concentration decreases from 10 to 0 5 μm the k values increase from 0 0021 to 0 0124 min 1 since the amount of pfos treatment per unit time was constant under the conditions of the pec system an increase in the initial concentration of pfos led to a reduction in the pfos degradation efficiency duan et al 2018 the electrolyte concentration was varied to study its effects on pfos degradation as shown in fig 4b purple line the pfos degradation k values increase from 0 0032 to 0 0124 min 1 with increasing electrolyte concentration from 10 to 50 mm however for increasing electrolyte concentrations from 50 to 100 mm no influence of electrolyte concentration on the rate of pfos removal was observed during the pec process enough ions in the system were required to promote electron transfer and facilitate the pec reaction while at lower electrolyte concentrations the abundance of ions was insufficient thereby leading to a reduction in the pfos degradation rate this phenomenon was consistent with the literature li et al 2009 song et al 2010 thus a 50 mm electrolyte sodium perchlorate was used in this study 3 2 2 pfos degradation mechanism in the pec process in the pec system with sodium perchlorate as the electrolyte multiple radical chain reactions occurred and several reactive oxygen species ros were generated as follows liu et al 2019 muruganandham and swaminathan 2004 2 oh oh e 3 h2o oh h e 4 2 oh h2o2 5 h2o2 hν 2 oh 6 h2o2 o2 2h 2e 7 o2 e o2 eqs 2 and 3 show the hydroxyl radical oh generated on the surface of the gotio2 photoelectrode through an electron transfer reaction eq 4 shows the production of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 from the oh self recombination reaction simultaneously h2o2 will also absorb uv light and transform into oh eqs 5 in addition h2o2 will be oxidized into o2 which further reacts with electrons to generate superoxide radicals o2 eqs 6 and 7 to elucidate the participation of reactive species in pfos degradation in the pec system scavenger experiments and probe tests were performed scavengers including benzoic acid p benzoquinone and potassium iodide each of 30 mm were utilized and individually spiked into the solutions benzoic acid and p benzoquinone can scavenge oh and o2 with reaction rate constants of 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 chen et al 2003 zrinyi and pham 2017 and 9 109 m 1 s 1 greenstock and miller 1975 palominos et al 2009 respectively the results in fig 4c show that the presence of benzoic acid and p benzoquinone led to the inhibition of pfos degradation among the two scavengers p benzoquinone suppressed pfos degradation to a larger extent the degradation rate decreased from 94 83 to 79 99 and 56 23 by the addition of benzoic acid and p benzoquinone respectively this implied the involvement of oh and o2 in the degradation of pfos in which o2 played a relatively important role the abundances of oh and o2 were further measured using the probe reagents nitrobenzene and hydroquinone each at 5 μm respectively fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 it was observed that the estimated concentrations of o2 and oh were 1 31 10 4 μm and 5 49 10 7 μm respectively detailed calculations of oh and o2 are provided in text s3 the steady state concentration of o2 in the pec system was significantly higher x223c 240 times than that of oh this result corresponded with the observation from the scavenger experiments which noted the predominant role of o2 in pfos degradation compared with that of oh on the other hand we observed that iodide anion i spiking resulted in significant inhibition of pfos degradation the η values decreased from 94 83 to 46 56 fig 4c the i present can compete with existing anions in the solution e g pfos anion and oh for sorption onto the gotio2 photoelectrode surface and further inhibit the electron transfer reaction contributed by the pfos anion and oh fang et al 2013 wang and zhang 2011 thus inhibition by i addition suggested that the electron transfer pathway also participated in pfos degradation overall the above results demonstrated that oh o2 and electron transfer reactions were all responsible for pfos degradation during the pec process 3 3 pfos transformation byproducts and pathways of the pec process during the pec reaction pfos undergoes various degradation pathways and is further transformed into various byproducts to fully explore the overall transformation pathway and elucidate the detailed reaction mechanism this study not only used pfos but also separately utilized eight main byproducts pfoa pfhpa pfhxa pfpea pfba pfpra pfhxs and pfbs which were detected during pfos degradation as the target pollutants to conduct the pec reaction the results in fig 5 a and b i represent pfos and its 8 main byproducts of degradation transformation via the pec reaction respectively the dotted lines represent the degradation of target pollutants formation of f and so4 2 which correspond to the left y axis and the solid lines with solid symbols and the open symbols represent the byproduct evolution corresponding to the byproducts nm and peak area 104 on the right y axis respectively in this work a total of 25 pfos transformation byproducts were observed detailed tof ms ms spectrometry parameter information on the 25 detected byproducts is presented in table s4 and the mass spectra and structures of the product ions scanned are shown in fig s1 these byproducts can be categorized into five groups including 5 pfsas 6 pfcas 5 pfals 4 hfcs and 5 others notably the byproduct pfsas p9 and p15 pfals and hfcs were identified for the first time on the other hand the results in most of the figures in fig 5 revealed that the transformation byproducts with different carbon chain lengths possess distinct degradation efficiencies the concentration of the long chain byproducts first increases and then decreases while the concentration of shorter chain byproducts continuously increases with time furthermore among the degradation of all studied pfaa target compounds the dotted line in fig 5 it was observed that pfaas with longer chain lengths have a higher degradation rate than pfaas with shorter chain lengths the relationship between carbon chain length and pfaa reactivity is discussed further in section 3 4 based on the identified byproduct information in this work and other relevant studies on pfos degradation duan et al 2020 shi et al 2019 the mechanism and pathway of pfos transformation in the pec system were proposed as shown in fig 6 initially pfos is transformed to pfos radicals through direct electron transfer on the surface of the gotio2 photoelectrode eq 8 then this radical is desulfonated to form c8f17 and sulfur trioxide so3 eq 9 after desulfonation c8f17 reacts with oh to generate the unstable alcohol c8f17oh eq 10 c8f17oh rapidly decomposed into c7f15cof with f release eqs 10 and 11 subsequently c7f15cof underwent a hydrolysis reaction and generated c7f15coo pfoa c8 and c7f15c o with the release of another f eq 12 through electron transfer and subsequent decarboxylation or decarbonylation pfoa and c7f15c o were further converted to c7f15 eqs 13 and 14 c7f15 and other shorter chain length cnf2n 1 n 3 6 underwent further reactions and transformed into c7f13h and other hfcs eq 15 on the other hand c7f15 also reacted with so3 generated from the electron transfer reaction of so3 and formed c7f15so3 pfsas c7 eqs 16 and 17 stepwise pfos was gradually decomposed into short chain pfaas and finally mineralized into co2 so4 2 and f on the other hand pfos also underwent defluorination and hydroxylation pathways of which p5 and p14 were the defluorinated byproducts while p4 was the hydroxylated byproduct additionally regarding the transformation trend of the hydroxylated byproduct p4 we observed that most of its concentrations continuously increased or reached a plateau fig 5 implying that it was recalcitrant and generated at the later stage of pfos transformation in summary the complete pfos degradation pathways include a desulfonation b oxidation followed by defluorination c decarboxylation d decarbonylation e sulfonation f defluorination and g hydroxylation the transformation byproducts include pfcas cnf2 1c o oh n 2 7 pfsas cmf2m 1so3h m 3 7 pfals cpf2p 1c o h p 3 6 hfcs cqf2q 1h q 3 7 and others p3 5 p8 and p14 however given that the authentic standards of some of the byproducts e g pfals and hfcs were not acquired in this work the production yields among all types of byproducts as well as the contribution of each transformation pathway could not be comprehensively elucidated compared further investigation is required 8 c8f17so3 c8f17so3 e 9 c8f17so3 c8f17 so3 10 c8f17 oh c8f17oh 11 c8f17oh c7f15cof h f 12 c7f15cof h2o c7f15coo c7f15c o 2h f 13 c7f15coo c7f15c o c7f15coo c7f15c o e 14 c7f15coo c7f15c o c7f15 co2 co 15 c7f15 3e c7f13 2f 16 so3 e so3 17 c7f15 so3 c7f15so3 3 3 1 comparison of the pfos degradation mechanisms between ec and pec processes the transformation byproduct generation in the ec system was also elucidated as shown in fig s6 to facilitate better understanding the photo electro synergistic mechanism comparing the results in figs 5a and s6 despite the similarity of the types of transformation byproducts observed between the ec and pec systems their transformation trends were distinctly different during the pec process the byproducts were continuously generated and further degraded over time while most of the byproducts in the ec system were slowly and continuously formed the detected trends of the parent compound pfos as well as the associated byproducts in the two systems revealed that not only a faster pfos degradation rate but also a rapid byproduct evolution profile occurred in the pec process this suggested that the applied uv radiation can synergistically benefit the associated pec reactions likely decreasing electron hole recombination and subsequently promoting the electron transfer reaction and reactive species production peng et al 2017 zhao and zhu 2006 thus leading to faster pfos decomposition and byproduct evolution degradation however further elucidation of the detailed synergistic mechanism is still needed 3 3 2 detoxification of pfos during the pec process the generation of byproducts via target compound decomposition leads to a change in toxicity during the treatment process lai et al 2017 yin et al 2018 however to date very few studies have examined the toxicity of pfos byproducts following the application of pec treatment the toxicity behavior during pfos degradation via the pec process is shown in fig s7 the results show that the toxicity gradually increased from 0 13 to 11 89 within the first 6 h during pfos degradation conversely the toxicity decreased from 11 89 to 2 57 after 6 h of reaction on the other hand regarding the results of the ion formation trend during pfos degradation in the pec system fig 5a the concentrations of fluoride and sulfate ions constantly increased over 12 h with significant production yields of 21 2 and 59 2 respectively which suggested the possible decomposition of pfos during the pec process overall according to the comparison of the byproduct transformation and ion formation fig 5a with the toxicity trends pfos was continuously decomposed into small fragment byproducts which possess low toxicity this demonstrated that the pec system developed in this work is a promising treatment process for pfos removal 3 4 the reactivity and competitive inhibition behavior of pfaas in section 3 3 we observed that pfos is transformed into variable chain length pfsa and pfca byproducts which contain sulfonate groups hso3 and carboxylic groups cooh respectively to further explore their reactivity and competitive inhibition behavior the degradation of pfsas and pfcas with different carbon chain lengths in the pec system was examined individually and in a mixture system the detailed observed degradation efficiencies η and rate constants k are provided in table s8 in the individual solution solution containing a single compound the results show that pfsas and pfcas with shorter carbon chains exhibited lower degradation rates the η value decreased in the following order pfos pfhxs pfbs for pfsas pfoa pfhpa pfhxa pfpea pfba pfpra for pfcas as shown in fig 7 a and b this phenomenon was also observed in other studies which indicated that pfaas with shorter carbon chain lengths were more persistent in ec systems niu et al 2012 wang et al 2020 furthermore we compared the relationship between the carbon chain length and degradation efficiency ratio ηmixture ηindividual for different pfaas as shown in fig 7c ηmixture ηindividual represents the degree of competitive inhibition that occurred for each pfaa in the mixture system compared with that in the individual system based on the results we observed that pfaas with longer carbon chain lengths exhibited weaker competitive inhibition behavior for instance pfos is the longest carbon chain pfaa studied in this work its degradation rates in the individual solution and in the mixture solution were very similar the ηmixture ηindividual value is 99 5 nearly 100 suggesting minimal competitive inhibition occurred fig 7a and c however for most of the other studied pfaas except for pfbs pfba and pfpra their degradation rates in the mixture solution were obviously slower than those in the individual solutions fig 7a and b with the ηmixture ηindividual value decreasing greatly with decreasing chain length fig 7c the difference in the competitive inhibition behavior for each pfaa is explained as follows pfaas with longer chain lengths possess greater molecular volumes hence they might have more opportunities to contact the photoanode and undergo further degradation according to table s8 pfos showing the highest ηmixture ηindividual value bears the largest molecular volume 272 1 cm3 mol 1 among the observed pfaas hence resulting in its weakest competitive inhibition behavior it should be noted that the three shorter chain compounds pfbs pfba and pfpra exhibited minimal degradation in the individual solutions their ηindividual values were all 20 thus the calculated ηmixture ηindividual values are relatively high which does not accurately reflect the actual competitive inhibition behavior hence they are excluded from discussion 4 conclusions the decomposition of pfos in a pec system was successfully achieved in this work by utilizing a fabricated gotio2 photoelectrode new insights into the pfos degradation mechanism have also been comprehensively elucidated for the first time the presence of go decreases the optical band gap and increases the surface area of the gotio2 photoelectrode contributing to its higher capacitance and hence leading to better pec performance in pfos degradation with a current density of 20 ma cm 2 electrode distance of 5 mm initial ph of 5 64 pfos 0 of 0 5 μm and naclo4 of 50 mm pfos was completely decomposed in 4 h the scavenger probe experiments showed that pfos degradation is attributed to the electron transfer reaction and oh and o2 attack further leading to its decomposition during the pathways of desulfonation oxidation then defluorination decarboxylation decarbonylation sulfonation defluorination and hydroxylation pfos is transformed into various byproducts including pfsas pfcas pfals hfcs and others further decomposition of pfos leads to its mineralization with the formation of fluoride ions and sulfate ions overall the results provide new insights into pfos degradation pathways which facilitate the comprehensive understanding of its decomposition and transformation in actual aquatic environments regarding the reactivity of pfos pfoa and other pfaas the results from this work demonstrated that the degradation rates of pfaas depend on their carbon chain length pfaas with shorter chain lengths possess lower degradation rates in addition when pfaas coexist greater competitive inhibition behavior was observed for the shorter chain length pfaa considering that these pfaa compound residues exist in mixtures in the real aquatic environment our above results imply that shorter chain length pfaas warrant more attention because they are not only difficult to degrade but also possess greater competitive inhibition behaviors and are thus more recalcitrant to water wastewater treatment processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this study was financially supported by funding

16497,a collaborative system including peroxymonosulfate pms activation in a photocatalytic fuel cell pfc with an bioi tio2 nanotube arrays p n type heterojunction as photoanode under visible light pfc bioi tna pms vis system was established xenon lamp was used as the light source of visible light a 4 6 times higher pseudo first order bezafibrate bzf degradation rate constant was achieved in this system compared with the single pfc bioi tna vis system the radical quenching experiments revealed that the contribution of reactive oxidative species ros followed the order of 1o2 h oh so4 o2 the epr tests demonstrated that pms addition enlarged the formation of 1o2 oh and so4 but suppressed o2 yield interestingly 1o2 was further proved to dominantly originated from the priority reaction between positive photoinduced holes h and negatively charged pms besides n2 purging tests and density functional theory calculation indicated that pms probably reacted with residual photoinduced electron e on the more negative conduction band cb of bioi to form oh and so4 but competed with dissolved oxygen other e transferred to the less negative cb of tna through p n junction will efficiently move to cathode through the external circuit the greatly promoted power generation of pfc system was observed after pms addition due to extra h consumption and efficient e separation and transfer besides three possible pathways for bzf degradation were proposed including hydroxylation fibrate chain substituent and amino bond fracture this study can provide new insights into the mechanisms of pms assisted photocatalysis and accompanying energy recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photocatalytic fuel cell bioi tna peroxymonosulfate bezafibrate degradation singlet oxygen mechanism 1 introduction the fibrate pharmaceuticals have been extensively used as a lipid regulating agent especially in developed countries and its annual consumption is estimated in hundreds of tons giebultowicz et al 2016 kosma et al 2010 nikolaou et al 2007 typical fibrate pharmaceutical compounds have been frequently detected in the drinking water rivers and sewage treatment plant effluents from ng l to μg l levels ido et al 2017 peng et al 2014 velasco santamaria et al 2011 notably the fibrate pharmaceuticals are recalcitrant to current water and wastewater treatments which could pose potential risks to aqueous environment and human health due to their non biodegradation character oliveira et al 2016 wang and wang 2016 accordingly more advanced technology need to be developed for the removal and mineralization of the trace amount of fibrate pharmaceuticals in recent decades tio2 nanotube arrays tna based photocatalytic fuel cell pfc has appeared as one of the most potential advanced oxidation processes aops technologies representing a simple and sustainable way to utilize the optical energy hu et al 2015 li et al 2014 qian et al 2019 ye et al 2018 it enables the photoinduced electrons e migrating from tio2 to the counter electrode through an external circuit driven by the photoinduced voltage and partial electric energy recovery during pollutants degradation can be achieved li et al 2019a lianos 2017 liu et al 2011 however its feasibility within the visible light region was hindered because of its wide band gap 3 2 ev and sluggish charge transfer kinetics mor et al 2006 nakata and fujishima 2012 thus the coupling of tna with a narrow band gap semiconductor is one of the most effective ways to enhance the visible light absorption ability very recently bismuth oxyhalides biox x cl br i act as the v vi vii ternary oxide and p type semiconductors have garnered increasing research interest due to its unique layered crystal structure consisting of bi2o2 2 slabs interleaved with double slabs of halogen atoms ren et al 2020 ye et al 2014 among them bioi exhibits the strongest response to visible light region in virtue of its narrow band gap 1 72 1 92 ev arumugam and choi 2020 wang et al 2020 therefore the construction of heterojunctions between bioi and tna has been received intense attention due to its distinct advantage such as higher solar absorptivity faster electron mobility and better quantum confinement effects cai et al 2019 fan et al 2020 tian et al 2018 another effective photocatalyst promoting technique is to establish an effective catalytic oxidation system through the combination of metal based semiconductor and oxidants guo et al 2020 hu et al 2019 peroxymonosulfate pms or persulfate ps activation assisted by photocatalysis has been found to be simple to operate and energy efficient without extrinsic chemical consumption or additional energy chen et al 2012 fang et al 2017 previous studies reveal that pms itself possesses an asymmetric structure hoo so3 vs 3os o so3 for ps and a longer superoxide oo bond io o 1 326 å than ps io o 1 322 å ghanbari and moradi 2017 wang and wang 2018 zhu et al 2018 as a result pms can be more easily activated and exhibit better application potentials than ps the fast recombination of photoinduced electron e hole h pairs will result in a low efficiency for contaminant removal in conventional photocatalysis systems pms could serve as an e acceptor and can also be activated to generate reactive oxidative species ros like oh and so4 chen et al 2020a yang et al 2019 if the photoinduced e from photoanode could be utilized by the addition of pms not only the charge separation is drastically enhanced but also the pollutant degradation performance could be significantly improved and the power generation of pfc system can be effectively strengthened shao et al 2020 in this case a synergistic effect will be achieved in the photo assisted pms activation process however conventional studies tend to use ultraviolet irradiation as light source li et al 2018 2019b tang et al 2019 or using transition metal based catalysts as photoanode or cathode like cofe2o4 cu co o oxide fe2o3 and so on yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2019a these settings could easily activate pms by themselves and may cause high energy consumption or metal leaching xiao et al 2018 very limited theoretical studies can be found to explain whether pms could be directly activated by pfc system under visible light in detail and the electrochemical performance of pfc system after pms addition is still not clear enough herein we are motivated to propose a collaborative system by adding pms into pfc under visible light pfc pms vis system to enhance the separation of photoinduced charges ros production and pollutant degradation synchronously a typical fibrates drugs bezafibrate bzf was chosen for

distance between the parallel photoanode and cathode was 1 cm in all the experiments the initial ph of reaction solution was adjusted to 7 0 except those designed to study the effect of ph with 0 5 m h2so4 and 1 m naoh a 500 w xenon lamp cel hxf300 china was used to provide simulated visible light irradiation with a 420 nm filter and the surface light intensity was determined by an optical power meter cel np2000 1 education au light co beijing china to be 100 mw cm2 λ 400 nm a certain amount of pms was dosed and the solution was immediately exposed to visible light to initiate the reaction at designed intervals 0 3 ml aqueous sample was withdrawn and rapidly mixed with 0 3 ml of meoh to quench the reaction all the reactions were performed at a constant temperature of 25 0 1 0 c controlled by water bath chemical quenchers were used to study the roles of specific ros played in bzf degradation by this pfc system the quenching agents for oh oh so4 h o2 and 1o2 were 10 mm tba 10 mm meoh 1 mm edta 2na 1 mm bq 40 mm l histidine or 10mm ffa respectively yin et al 2020 yun et al 2018 the estimation of second order rate constant of each quencher with ros and selection of quencher dosage were further illustrated in text s1 supplementary material all experiments were carried out in triplicates and each data point represents the average value a pseudo first order kinetics model eq 1 was applied to evaluate the degradation performance of the reaction processes 1 ln c c 0 k 60 t where c0 is the initial concentration of the degradation reactant c is the concentration at time t k60 is the pseudo first order rate constant min 1 during the 60 minute degradation process 2 4 analytical methods bzf concentrations were measured by hitachi 5100 hplc equipped with ultraviolet detector setting wavelength of 230 nm the tps during reaction were measured by a lc ms ms i e shimadzu lc 30a ab sciex triple tof 4600 more detailed information was shown in text s2 supplementary material in order to verify the pms consumption during reaction the concentration of pms in the solution was determined using a modified ki method liang et al 2008 the reactive free radicals were detected by epr technique using a hitachi epr spectrometer jes fa200 the detailed information for the detection of pms concentration epr tests and density functional theory dft calculation were given in text s3 5 atomic numbering of bzf molecule assigned in this study was shown in fig s1 the relevant dft calculation results were summarized in table s1 the crystal models of bioi and tio2 were shown in fig s2 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of photoanodes the sem images of tna is shown in fig 1 a to investigate the morphology of tna the uniform and regular tube structures could be clearly observed and the average diameter and wall thickness of tna was 150 and 15 nm respectively the morphology and microstructure of bioi tna composite were also studied by sem as shown in fig 1b d the typical sem images of bioi tna in fig 1b d showed that the chrysanthemum like nanoflowers were scattered on the tna surface and careful observation indicated that the nanoflowers were constituted by ultrathin bioi nanosheets with the thickness of about 10 nm this embedding mode will be favorable for the enlargement of contact surface and interface connection between bioi and tna the chemical composition of bioi tna was investigated by xps spectra as shown in fig 2 the signals of bi i ti o c and n elements were found in fig 2a and all the xps data were calibrated with the banding energy of c 1 s the bi 4f binding energy of bioi tna was located at 159 4 ev and 164 7 ev and the two strongest peaks were assigned to the orbital 4f7 2 and 4f5 2 of bi3 as shown in fig 2b barreca et al 2001 two characteristic peaks were displayed in fig 2c at 619 4 ev and 630 9 ev which could be corresponded to i 3d5 2 and i 3d3 2 confirming the states of i in bioi tna zhang et al 2009 as shown in fig 2d the two strongest peaks were detected at 459 2 ev and 465 9 ev corresponding to 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 of ti element ren et al 2007 the o 1 s spectrum in fig 2e exhibited binding energy of 530 3 ev 530 8 ev and 531 8 ev which was ascribed to lattice oxygen of in bioi tio2 surface hydroxyl groups and adsorbed water respectively dai et al 2011 the above xps results confirm the coexistence of bioi and tio2 in the bioi tna heterostructure the inset of fig 3 a shows the steady state pl spectra of all samples with the excitation wavelength of 420 nm in general the lower pl intensity indicates the lower recombination of charge carries 39 40 obviously the pl intensity of bioi tna was much lower than that of pure tna and bioi ti which confirms the existence of heterojunction that can help transferring the photoinduced e the transient photocurrent responses were carried out under visible light at an applied open circuit potential of 0 8 v vs she and the results were illustrated in fig 3b the average jsc value of tna was about 0 030 ma cm 2 indicating that tna could still be sensitized under visible light this could be mainly attributed to the extended light absorption from n doping wang et al 2009 the average jsc value of bioi tna was about 0 130 ma cm 2 which was 3 4 and 4 3 times higher than that of bioi ti about 0 038 ma cm 2 and tna about 0 030 ma cm 2 this demonstrated that bioi tna exhibited the highest photocurrent response which was attributed to the enhanced light harvesting ability and charge separation the interfacial charge behaviors across the heterointerface of bioi tna is an essential factor for the ros generation in photocatalysis to acquire the detailed charge transfer pathway dft calculation was employed to evaluate the electronic potentials of bioi and tio2 shown in fig 4 the working functions of tio2 and boi are 8 61 and 6 64 ev respectively the difference of working functions between tio2 and bioi could prove the existence of charge migration in the contact surface of tio2 and bioi samples as bioi has lower working function and higher fermi level it can easily serve as electron donor and oxidization candidate in contrast tio2 could function as e acceptor and oxidization candidate with higher working function and lower fermi level therefore more h leaved on the bioi surface could participate in the ros generation and bzf degradation 3 2 comparison of bzf degradation performance in different reaction systems the variation of bzf concentration c c0 with reaction time in different reaction systems i e 1 pms dark 2 pms vis 3 pfc tna as anode vis 4 pfc bioi tna as anode vis 5 pfc tna as anode pms dark 6 pfc bioi tna as anode pms dark 7 pfc tna as anode pms vis and 8 pfc bioi tna as anode pms vis systems were illustrated in fig 5 the pseudo first order rate constants k60 min 1 and bzf degradation efficiencies in different reaction systems were summarized in table s2 it was apparent that no obvious degradation was monitored in pms dark or pms vis system revealing that pms itself was unable to degrade bzf directly and also pms could be hardly activated by visible light besides pfc tna vis system showed almost no bzf degradation capacity and the low visible light response of tna might be the main reason meanwhile it can be observed that bzf degradation efficiency can be distinctly improved up to 23 7 in pfc bioi tna vis system which may be attributed to the enhanced visible light response and increased reaction sites after bioi decoration after pms addition the bzf degradation efficiency in the pfc tna pms dark system and pfc bioi tna pms dark system were compared in order to investigate whether pms could be directly activated by tna or bioi notably no obvious bzf degradation 2 6 degradation was observed in the pfc tna pms dark system but the pfc bioi tna pms dark system exhibited a bzf degradation of 10 2 this suggests that pms itself could be activated at a low efficiency by bioi because the redox cycle of bi iii bi v could cause pms activation to generate few so4 and oh zhang et al 2017 when turning on the visible light both the pfc tna pms vis and pfc bioi tna pms vis systems displayed significantly improved bzf degradation capacities especially the highest k60 and degradation efficiency was achieved in pfc bioi tna pms vis system k60 0 023 min 1 74 8 degradation which was 4 6 times and 3 16 times higher compared with the pfc bioi tna pms vis system k60 0 005 min 1 23 7 degradation this indicates that pms could be effectively activated in the presence of bioi tna photoanode and visible light and more ros can be produced during reaction than that in the single pfc bioi tna vis system additionally the effects of pms dosage initial solution ph different water matrices i e typical anions cl po4 3 and hco3 and natural organic matter nom on bzf degradation in pfc bioi tna pms vis system and stability analysis system were all systematically investigated and illustrated in text 6 9 and fig s3 s7 supplementary material 3 3 mechanisms study of pfc bioi tna pms vis system 3 3 1 identification of ros the probable ros that participated in the degradation of bzf were explored via the quenching experiments in this study the degradation of bzf through pfc bioi tna pms vis system with addition of specific quenchers were shown in fig 6 the pseudo first order rate constants k60 min 1 and bzf degradation efficiencies with different quenchers addition were summarized in table s3 the results from fig 6 and table s3 reveal that the addition of all quenchers exert negative effects on bzf degradation which confirms the contribution of each ros k60 decreased from 0 023 min 1 to 0 015 min 1 34 8 reduction 0 012 min 1 47 8 reduction 0 003 min 1 87 0 reduction 0 0018 min 1 92 2 reduction and 0 0026 min 1 88 7 reduction by adding tba meoh edta 2na l histidine and ffa respectively notably there is no obvious change of k60 or degradation efficiency when 1 mm bq was added into the reaction solution indicating that o2 played the negligible role in bzf degradation therefore the contribution of each ros during degradation of bzf follows the order 1o2 h oh so4 o2 to further investigate the origins of these ros epr spectra were measured and shown in fig 7 1 o2 made the greatest contribution to bzf degradation in pfc bioi tna pms vis system 1o2 is recognized as a highly selective oxidant that will react almost exclusively with unsaturated organics through e abstraction and electrophilic addition frimer 1979 kearns 1971 as shown in fig 7a stronger epr signals of temp 1o2 were observed after pms addition further proving that 1o2 production was greatly enhanced according to the previous studies the generation of 1o2 could be mainly derived from three pathways pathway i is that e transition of the lattice oxygen in the catalyst with low band gap may participate in the 1o2 production in order to examine whether 1o2 could be produced by lattice oxygen the xps spectra of o1s before and after reaction was compared as shown in fig s8 there is no obvious variation of the signal intensities associated to the lattice oxygen in bioi tna after 60 min reaction indicating that the contribution of lattice oxygen to 1o2 formation was negligible pathway ii is that the photoinduced e may be captured by dissolved oxygen do to form o2 which can be further converted into 1o2 through eq 2 4 and the presence of pms may boost this transformation hu et al 2019 however a very weak signal of dmpoo2 spin adduct was detected in pfc bioi tna vis system shown in fig 7c while the signal was even harder to be found after pms addition this demonstrates that fewer amount of o2 was produced in pfc bioi tna pms vis system than the single pfc bioi tna vis system thus o2 could not play an important role in 1o2 generation as is known that under visible light irradiation with energy less than 2 95 ev λ 420 nm e in the valence band of bioi will be excited up to a higher conduction band cb potential edge 0 56 v vs sce which is more active than that of tio2 0 16 v vs sce zhang et al 2009 therefore the photoinduced e could easily transfer from cb edge of bioi to the cb edge of tio2 leaving the h on the valence band vb however the redox potential of o2 o2 0 33 v vs nhe was more negative than the cb edge potential of tio2 chen et al 2017 therefore e on the cb of tio2 could hardly reduce o2 into o2 and they will migrate to pt cathode through the external circuit and be continuously consumed via the 4 e oxygen reduction reaction orr o2 4h 4e 2h2o deng et al 2014 2 e o2 o2 3 o2 h ho2 4 2 ho2 1o2 h2o2 pathway iii is that pms itself could play a key role in the 1o2 generation as is well known that pms can generate 1o2 by self decomposition because the oo bonds of pms could be activated by easy energy instead of electron transfer process as depicted in eq 5 but the 1o2 production through pms self decomposition is relatively inefficient evans and upton 1985 most importantly pms will be easier to react with h to form so5 other than react with e to form so4 under visible light irradiation in this reaction system the negatively charged pms molecule would prefer to react with the electron deficient site chen et al 2019 thus h could act as the e deficient center and lead to the oxidation of pms and generation of so5 according to our dft calculation the adsorption energy of pms absorbed on tio2 and bioi were 2 89 ev and 6 06 ev respectively this also demonstrates that pms is more inclined to be absorbed on the bioi surface other than tio2 therefore the anionic pms will interact with positively charged bioi through the electrostatic adsorption and single electron transfer could happen from pms to the h on bioi the generated so5 has longer duration than so4 and so5 will subsequently recombination or react with h2o to form 1o2 as shown in eq 6 8 to further explore the role of h played in the reaction 1 mm edta 2na was added in the epr tests as the quencher of h as shown in fig 7b a much weaker signal of tmp 1o2 result was observed after addition of edta 2na further proving that h played a key role in the 1o2 generation this could also explain the reason that why h made a great contribution to bzf degradation in this system 5 hso5 so5 2 hso4 so4 2 1o2 6 hso5 h so5 h 7 2so5 h2o 1 5 1o2 2hso4 8 so5 so5 1o2 2so4 2 the dmpo oh so4 results were displayed in fig 7d in the absence of pms no oh signals were detected in the dark but the corresponding signal was found under visible light irradiation after the addition of pms the intensity of dmpo oh signal increased slightly while the typical signals for so4 were not found in the epr spectra however several signal peaks in addition to dmpo oh were observed which could be attributed to the hyperfine splitting of dmpo x derived from the fast oxidation of dmpo oh et al 2016 yin et al 2018 the generation of dmpo x can verify the powerful oxidizing capacity of the radicals like so4 generated in the reaction system ding et al 2020 this indicates that the addition of pms enhanced the production of oh also the contribution of so4 to bzf degradation cannot be ignored however there is no obvious increase of dmpo x signal intensity after turning on the light this demonstrates that pms was hard to produce so4 by photoinduced e and only a few amount of so4 may be produced from the pms activation by bioi zhang et al 2017 therefore so4 played a minor role in this reaction system 3 3 2 detection of 1o2 origin in order to investigate the contribution of do to the bzf degradation experiments were conducted in the pfc bioi tna pms vis system with n2 purging do concentration 0 mg l the variation of bzf concentration with addition of specific quenchers in absence of do were shown in fig 8 a the k 60 and total bzf removal efficiencies with different quenchers addition were summarized in table s4 from fig 8 a and table s4 can be seen that the bzf degradation in absence of do k60 0 030 min 1 82 8 degradation was even faster than that in presence of do k60 0 023 min 1 74 8 degradation while 1o2 and h still played the dominated role during degradation compared with the condition in presence of do higher decrease of k60 was observed with meoh addition 47 8 reduction when do 6 mg l 60 0 reduction when do 0 mg l indicating the increased contribution of so4 without do this is due to that do in the solution could compete with pms to acquire e or hinder the adsorption of pms on bioi therefore pms could be adsorbed on the bioi surface much easier and boost the so4 generation without do hso5 e so4 oh moreover the generation of 1o2 from pms self decomposition or the reaction between pms and h could also be enhanced fig 8b shows the pms consumption during reaction in presence or absence of do it can be seen that the pms consumption in absence of do 44 8 consumption was almost 2 2 times higher than that in presence of do 20 4 consumption to deeper investigate the mechanism epr spectra were measured in absence of do and the results were shown in fig 9 a b a strong signal of tmp 1o2 was still observed fig 9a moreover the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 were also observed fig 9b this indicates that 1o2 oh and so4 could still be produced from pms conversion and pms activation can be strengthened without do both the results from fig 8b and fig 9a b demonstrates that the conversion from pms to various ros especially 1o2 and so4 were boosted this is because that when do was excluded from the reaction system pms will be easily close to the catalyst surface especially be absorbed on the bioi surface as photoinduced e on the cb of bioi is able to reduce o2 into o2 do could compete with pms for e which were left on the bioi therefore when do was excluded from the reaction system pms will be activated by e more easily on the bioi surface accordingly the bzf degradation will be enhanced in absence of do 3 4 transformation products and degradation pathways tps of bzf during reaction were identified using lc ms ms detection as shown in table s5 supplementary material the calculated isosurfaces and orbital energies of homo and lumo of bzf was shown in fig 10 a besides in order to figure out the relationship between the ros attack and tps formation quenching experiments were conducted to explore the effect of each ros on tps formation as seen in fig 11 in control group no quencher was added into the solution in group1 10 mm tba was added into the solution before reaction to quench oh in group 2 10 mm meoh was added to quench both oh and so4 in group 3 10 mm meoh and 1 mm furfuryl alcohol ffa were added simultaneously to quench oh so4 and 1o2 thus the effect of h on tps formation could be detected as has been proved that o2 contributed little to bzf degradation the effect of o2 on tps could be ignored in each group samples were withdrawn after 10 min reaction then the tps of each sample were analyzed by lc ms ms system a possible set of reaction pathways consistent with the observed tps were graphically illustrated in fig 10b in general bzf was mainly degraded in pfc bioi tna pms vis system via the following three pathways i hydroxylation oh addition was perceived to occur in the aromatic ring structure which was confirmed by the identified product of tp1 m z 377 razavi et al 2009 wu et al 2019 the isosurface of homo orbital mainly locates on the phenoxyaromatic acid fragment of bzf as shown in fig 10a indicating that such fragment will be more susceptible to be attacked by the electrophilic species like oh so4 1o2 and h further hydroxylation of tp1 will lead to the formation of tp2 m z 393 as seen in fig 11b c tp1 and tp2 formation decreased significantly in group1 and they were even not detected in group2 indicating that tp1 and tp2 was mainly formed from oh attack while so4 made a minor contribution ii the fibrate chain was removed while the hydroxyl group substituted the phenoxy group to form tp4 fibrate chain o c ch3 2cooh could serve as the electron donor as illustrated in table s1 and it exerts a positive influence on the electron density of the connected aromatic ring therefore c16 on the aromatic ring has a much higher homo composition 21 347 and it will be vulnerable for various electrophilic species attack as seen in fig 11 tp4 was confirmed as the dominant tps during bzf degradation tp4 was then oxidized continuously to produce tp5 and tp6 while the continuous fibrate chain substitution of tp2 might also lead to tp 6 formation except for oh attack tp 4 5 and 6 as the phenolic intermediates could also be produced by 1o2 initiated oxidation through the reaction of 1 3 addition 1 4 cycloaddition and 1 2 cycloaddition zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2019b after that tp6 underwent a ringopening reaction and can be further oxidized to form tp7 as seen in fig 11 the formation amount of tp4 5 and 6 was significantly decreased in group3 compared with other groups indicating that 1o2 attack made a major contribution to the pathway from bzf to tp6 besides there was no obvious change of tp7 formation in each group indicating that h oxidation made a primary contribution to tp7 formation iii the fracture of amino bond will lead to the formation of tp3 as the n9 atom could contribute to homo and lumo orbital both electrophilic reaction and nucleophilic reaction may happen on this site and cause the amino bond broken as little formation of tp3 was observed in each group transformation from bzf to tp3 may be the minor pathway of bzf degradation finally the above intermediates could be mineralized into smaller intermediates or directly into co2 and h2o 3 5 photo electrochemical performance and power generation the overall photo electrochemical activity of the tna and bioi tna photoanodes were assed using a typical three electrode photo electrochemical cell irradiated using a visible light simulator at a power intensity of 100 mw cm 2 fig 12 a shows the results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis analysis generally a lower arc radius in eis indicated a lower resistance value which facilitates the separation of photoinduced e h pairs ângelo et al 2016 the arc radius of bioi tna was smaller with respect to tna when exposed to visible light and a much smaller arc radius was observed when 0 25 mm pms was added into the pfc system in addition a 0 069 v bzf oxidizing peak is observed in the cyclic voltammetry curve shown in fig 12b in which bioi tna with pms addition exhibits the strongest current signal when bzf was oxidized this could further prove that the bzf oxidation could be greatly enhanced when pms was introduced into the reaction power generation of the various pfc systems were assessed by measuring the polarization curve i e voltage vs current density and determining the maximum power density as shown in fig 12c d when using bioi tna as photoanode a much higher open circuit potential and maximum power density up to 0 22 v and 4 6 mw m 2 were observed besides both the open circuit potential and maximum power density concomitantly increased from 0 22 to 0 27 v and 4 6 to 8 2 mw m 2 when 0 25 mm pms was introduced into the pfc system additionally a 2 8 times higher photocurrent response was detected after pms addition as shown in fig s9 supplementary material accordingly pms in electrolyte could serve as a good e acceptor and reduce the internal resistance facilitating the e transportation photocurrent flow increase and bzf oxidation simultaneously the power generation of pfc could be strongly enhanced besides the power generation of pfc bioi tna pms vis system without na2so4 addition as electrolyte was also conducted and the results were shown in fig s10 a high open circuit potential and maximum power density up to 0 23 v and 7 6 mw m 2 was still observed without electrolyte na2so4 addition demonstrating that pms itself could act as an electrolyte and maintain the high power generation of pfc bioi tna pms vis system based on all the results above the possible mechanism for the pollutant decomposition and power generation in the pfc bioi tna pms vis system was proposed and illustrated in scheme 1 the enhanced catalytic performance and power generation could be mainly attributed to three reasons first much more ros in the pfc system were produced after pms addition than that of conventional pfc process especially 1o2 oh and so4 due to the strong redox ability of oh so4 tang et al 2018 and longer half life and higher selectivity of 1o2 scully and hoigne 1987 pfc bioi tna pms vis system exhibits the enhanced bzf degradation performance second as pms was more inclined to interact with h on the bioi surface and the competition of pms with do for e mainly happened on the cb of bioi other e transferred to the tna will efficiently move to pt cathode through the external circuit therefore a higher electric current at the external circuit is simultaneously generated due to the amplified potential difference between photoanode and cathode also the e consumption of pfc was accelerated after pms addition 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that bzf which is recalcitrant to biodegradation and direct photodegradation could be degraded efficiently in effluent through the combination of pfc system and pms activation under visible light pfc bioi tna pms vis system a 4 6 times higher k60 and 1 8 times higher maximum power generation was achieved in this system compared with the single pfc bioi tna vis system the quencher tests revealed that 1o2 played a key role in bzf degradation and reaction between pms and h was confirmed as the major pathway of 1o2 generation because the negative charged hso5 was more inclined to interact with positive charged h rather than e the epr tests revealed that pms addition could promote the generation of 1o2 oh and so4 while o2 could hardly be produced additionally n2 purging tests revealed that pms and dissolved oxygen do could compete for reacting with e on the more negative conduction band of bioi to form oh and so4 while other e transferred to tna through p n junction will efficiently move to cathode through external circuit three bzf degradation pathways in this reaction system have also been proposed including hydroxylation fibrate chain substituent and amino bond fracture notably a much higher photo electrochemical performance and power production were achieved in pfc bioi tna pms vis system which could be attributed to the enlarged ros formation extra h consumption and efficient e separation and transfer all the results confirmed that the pfc bioi tna pms vis system proposed in this study is suitable for actual application with high efficiency and low energy consumption future study should pay more attention to the treatment of real target effluent by this proposed system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16497,a collaborative system including peroxymonosulfate pms activation in a photocatalytic fuel cell pfc with an bioi tio2 nanotube arrays p n type heterojunction as photoanode under visible light pfc bioi tna pms vis system was established xenon lamp was used as the light source of visible light a 4 6 times higher pseudo first order bezafibrate bzf degradation rate constant was achieved in this system compared with the single pfc bioi tna vis system the radical quenching experiments revealed that the contribution of reactive oxidative species ros followed the order of 1o2 h oh so4 o2 the epr tests demonstrated that pms addition enlarged the formation of 1o2 oh and so4 but suppressed o2 yield interestingly 1o2 was further proved to dominantly originated from the priority reaction between positive photoinduced holes h and negatively charged pms besides n2 purging tests and density functional theory calculation indicated that pms probably reacted with residual photoinduced electron e on the more negative conduction band cb of bioi to form oh and so4 but competed with dissolved oxygen other e transferred to the less negative cb of tna through p n junction will efficiently move to cathode through the external circuit the greatly promoted power generation of pfc system was observed after pms addition due to extra h consumption and efficient e separation and transfer besides three possible pathways for bzf degradation were proposed including hydroxylation fibrate chain substituent and amino bond fracture this study can provide new insights into the mechanisms of pms assisted photocatalysis and accompanying energy recovery graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photocatalytic fuel cell bioi tna peroxymonosulfate bezafibrate degradation singlet oxygen mechanism 1 introduction the fibrate pharmaceuticals have been extensively used as a lipid regulating agent especially in developed countries and its annual consumption is estimated in hundreds of tons giebultowicz et al 2016 kosma et al 2010 nikolaou et al 2007 typical fibrate pharmaceutical compounds have been frequently detected in the drinking water rivers and sewage treatment plant effluents from ng l to μg l levels ido et al 2017 peng et al 2014 velasco santamaria et al 2011 notably the fibrate pharmaceuticals are recalcitrant to current water and wastewater treatments which could pose potential risks to aqueous environment and human health due to their non biodegradation character oliveira et al 2016 wang and wang 2016 accordingly more advanced technology need to be developed for the removal and mineralization of the trace amount of fibrate pharmaceuticals in recent decades tio2 nanotube arrays tna based photocatalytic fuel cell pfc has appeared as one of the most potential advanced oxidation processes aops technologies representing a simple and sustainable way to utilize the optical energy hu et al 2015 li et al 2014 qian et al 2019 ye et al 2018 it enables the photoinduced electrons e migrating from tio2 to the counter electrode through an external circuit driven by the photoinduced voltage and partial electric energy recovery during pollutants degradation can be achieved li et al 2019a lianos 2017 liu et al 2011 however its feasibility within the visible light region was hindered because of its wide band gap 3 2 ev and sluggish charge transfer kinetics mor et al 2006 nakata and fujishima 2012 thus the coupling of tna with a narrow band gap semiconductor is one of the most effective ways to enhance the visible light absorption ability very recently bismuth oxyhalides biox x cl br i act as the v vi vii ternary oxide and p type semiconductors have garnered increasing research interest due to its unique layered crystal structure consisting of bi2o2 2 slabs interleaved with double slabs of halogen atoms ren et al 2020 ye et al 2014 among them bioi exhibits the strongest response to visible light region in virtue of its narrow band gap 1 72 1 92 ev arumugam and choi 2020 wang et al 2020 therefore the construction of heterojunctions between bioi and tna has been received intense attention due to its distinct advantage such as higher solar absorptivity faster electron mobility and better quantum confinement effects cai et al 2019 fan et al 2020 tian et al 2018 another effective photocatalyst promoting technique is to establish an effective catalytic oxidation system through the combination of metal based semiconductor and oxidants guo et al 2020 hu et al 2019 peroxymonosulfate pms or persulfate ps activation assisted by photocatalysis has been found to be simple to operate and energy efficient without extrinsic chemical consumption or additional energy chen et al 2012 fang et al 2017 previous studies reveal that pms itself possesses an asymmetric structure hoo so3 vs 3os o so3 for ps and a longer superoxide oo bond io o 1 326 å than ps io o 1 322 å ghanbari and moradi 2017 wang and wang 2018 zhu et al 2018 as a result pms can be more easily activated and exhibit better application potentials than ps the fast recombination of photoinduced electron e hole h pairs will result in a low efficiency for contaminant removal in conventional photocatalysis systems pms could serve as an e acceptor and can also be activated to generate reactive oxidative species ros like oh and so4 chen et al 2020a yang et al 2019 if the photoinduced e from photoanode could be utilized by the addition of pms not only the charge separation is drastically enhanced but also the pollutant degradation performance could be significantly improved and the power generation of pfc system can be effectively strengthened shao et al 2020 in this case a synergistic effect will be achieved in the photo assisted pms activation process however conventional studies tend to use ultraviolet irradiation as light source li et al 2018 2019b tang et al 2019 or using transition metal based catalysts as photoanode or cathode like cofe2o4 cu co o oxide fe2o3 and so on yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2019a these settings could easily activate pms by themselves and may cause high energy consumption or metal leaching xiao et al 2018 very limited theoretical studies can be found to explain whether pms could be directly activated by pfc system under visible light in detail and the electrochemical performance of pfc system after pms addition is still not clear enough herein we are motivated to propose a collaborative system by adding pms into pfc under visible light pfc pms vis system to enhance the separation of photoinduced charges ros production and pollutant degradation synchronously a typical fibrates drugs bezafibrate bzf was chosen for

atomic numbering of bzf molecule assigned in this study was shown in fig s1 the relevant dft calculation results were summarized in table s1 the crystal models of bioi and tio2 were shown in fig s2 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of photoanodes the sem images of tna is shown in fig 1 a to investigate the morphology of tna the uniform and regular tube structures could be clearly observed and the average diameter and wall thickness of tna was 150 and 15 nm respectively the morphology and microstructure of bioi tna composite were also studied by sem as shown in fig 1b d the typical sem images of bioi tna in fig 1b d showed that the chrysanthemum like nanoflowers were scattered on the tna surface and careful observation indicated that the nanoflowers were constituted by ultrathin bioi nanosheets with the thickness of about 10 nm this embedding mode will be favorable for the enlargement of contact surface and interface connection between bioi and tna the chemical composition of bioi tna was investigated by xps spectra as shown in fig 2 the signals of bi i ti o c and n elements were found in fig 2a and all the xps data were calibrated with the banding energy of c 1 s the bi 4f binding energy of bioi tna was located at 159 4 ev and 164 7 ev and the two strongest peaks were assigned to the orbital 4f7 2 and 4f5 2 of bi3 as shown in fig 2b barreca et al 2001 two characteristic peaks were displayed in fig 2c at 619 4 ev and 630 9 ev which could be corresponded to i 3d5 2 and i 3d3 2 confirming the states of i in bioi tna zhang et al 2009 as shown in fig 2d the two strongest peaks were detected at 459 2 ev and 465 9 ev corresponding to 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 of ti element ren et al 2007 the o 1 s spectrum in fig 2e exhibited binding energy of 530 3 ev 530 8 ev and 531 8 ev which was ascribed to lattice oxygen of in bioi tio2 surface hydroxyl groups and adsorbed water respectively dai et al 2011 the above xps results confirm the coexistence of bioi and tio2 in the bioi tna heterostructure the inset of fig 3 a shows the steady state pl spectra of all samples with the excitation wavelength of 420 nm in general the lower pl intensity indicates the lower recombination of charge carries 39 40 obviously the pl intensity of bioi tna was much lower than that of pure tna and bioi ti which confirms the existence of heterojunction that can help transferring the photoinduced e the transient photocurrent responses were carried out under visible light at an applied open circuit potential of 0 8 v vs she and the results were illustrated in fig 3b the average jsc value of tna was about 0 030 ma cm 2 indicating that tna could still be sensitized under visible light this could be mainly attributed to the extended light absorption from n doping wang et al 2009 the average jsc value of bioi tna was about 0 130 ma cm 2 which was 3 4 and 4 3 times higher than that of bioi ti about 0 038 ma cm 2 and tna about 0 030 ma cm 2 this demonstrated that bioi tna exhibited the highest photocurrent response which was attributed to the enhanced light harvesting ability and charge separation the interfacial charge behaviors across the heterointerface of bioi tna is an essential factor for the ros generation in photocatalysis to acquire the detailed charge transfer pathway dft calculation was employed to evaluate the electronic potentials of bioi and tio2 shown in fig 4 the working functions of tio2 and boi are 8 61 and 6 64 ev respectively the difference of working functions between tio2 and bioi could prove the existence of charge migration in the contact surface of tio2 and bioi samples as bioi has lower working function and higher fermi level it can easily serve as electron donor and oxidization candidate in contrast tio2 could function as e acceptor and oxidization candidate with higher working function and lower fermi level therefore more h leaved on the bioi surface could participate in the ros generation and bzf degradation 3 2 comparison of bzf degradation performance in different reaction systems the variation of bzf concentration c c0 with reaction time in different reaction systems i e 1 pms dark 2 pms vis 3 pfc tna as anode vis 4 pfc bioi tna as anode vis 5 pfc tna as anode pms dark 6 pfc bioi tna as anode pms dark 7 pfc tna as anode pms vis and 8 pfc bioi tna as anode pms vis systems were illustrated in fig 5 the pseudo first order rate constants k60 min 1 and bzf degradation efficiencies in different reaction systems were summarized in table s2 it was apparent that no obvious degradation was monitored in pms dark or pms vis system revealing that pms itself was unable to degrade bzf directly and also pms could be hardly activated by visible light besides pfc tna vis system showed almost no bzf degradation capacity and the low visible light response of tna might be the main reason meanwhile it can be observed that bzf degradation efficiency can be distinctly improved up to 23 7 in pfc bioi tna vis system which may be attributed to the enhanced visible light response and increased reaction sites after bioi decoration after pms addition the bzf degradation efficiency in the pfc tna pms dark system and pfc bioi tna pms dark system were compared in order to investigate whether pms could be directly activated by tna or bioi notably no obvious bzf degradation 2 6 degradation was observed in the pfc tna pms dark system but the pfc bioi tna pms dark system exhibited a bzf degradation of 10 2 this suggests that pms itself could be activated at a low efficiency by bioi because the redox cycle of bi iii bi v could cause pms activation to generate few so4 and oh zhang et al 2017 when turning on the visible light both the pfc tna pms vis and pfc bioi tna pms vis systems displayed significantly improved bzf degradation capacities especially the highest k60 and degradation efficiency was achieved in pfc bioi tna pms vis system k60 0 023 min 1 74 8 degradation which was 4 6 times and 3 16 times higher compared with the pfc bioi tna pms vis system k60 0 005 min 1 23 7 degradation this indicates that pms could be effectively activated in the presence of bioi tna photoanode and visible light and more ros can be produced during reaction than that in the single pfc bioi tna vis system additionally the effects of pms dosage initial solution ph different water matrices i e typical anions cl po4 3 and hco3 and natural organic matter nom on bzf degradation in pfc bioi tna pms vis system and stability analysis system were all systematically investigated and illustrated in text 6 9 and fig s3 s7 supplementary material 3 3 mechanisms study of pfc bioi tna pms vis system 3 3 1 identification of ros the probable ros that participated in the degradation of bzf were explored via the quenching experiments in this study the degradation of bzf through pfc bioi tna pms vis system with addition of specific quenchers were shown in fig 6 the pseudo first order rate constants k60 min 1 and bzf degradation efficiencies with different quenchers addition were summarized in table s3 the results from fig 6 and table s3 reveal that the addition of all quenchers exert negative effects on bzf degradation which confirms the contribution of each ros k60 decreased from 0 023 min 1 to 0 015 min 1 34 8 reduction 0 012 min 1 47 8 reduction 0 003 min 1 87 0 reduction 0 0018 min 1 92 2 reduction and 0 0026 min 1 88 7 reduction by adding tba meoh edta 2na l histidine and ffa respectively notably there is no obvious change of k60 or degradation efficiency when 1 mm bq was added into the reaction solution indicating that o2 played the negligible role in bzf degradation therefore the contribution of each ros during degradation of bzf follows the order 1o2 h oh so4 o2 to further investigate the origins of these ros epr spectra were measured and shown in fig 7 1 o2 made the greatest contribution to bzf degradation in pfc bioi tna pms vis system 1o2 is recognized as a highly selective oxidant that will react almost exclusively with unsaturated organics through e abstraction and electrophilic addition frimer 1979 kearns 1971 as shown in fig 7a stronger epr signals of temp 1o2 were observed after pms addition further proving that 1o2 production was greatly enhanced according to the previous studies the generation of 1o2 could be mainly derived from three pathways pathway i is that e transition of the lattice oxygen in the catalyst with low band gap may participate in the 1o2 production in order to examine whether 1o2 could be produced by lattice oxygen the xps spectra of o1s before and after reaction was compared as shown in fig s8 there is no obvious variation of the signal intensities associated to the lattice oxygen in bioi tna after 60 min reaction indicating that the contribution of lattice oxygen to 1o2 formation was negligible pathway ii is that the photoinduced e may be captured by dissolved oxygen do to form o2 which can be further converted into 1o2 through eq 2 4 and the presence of pms may boost this transformation hu et al 2019 however a very weak signal of dmpoo2 spin adduct was detected in pfc bioi tna vis system shown in fig 7c while the signal was even harder to be found after pms addition this demonstrates that fewer amount of o2 was produced in pfc bioi tna pms vis system than the single pfc bioi tna vis system thus o2 could not play an important role in 1o2 generation as is known that under visible light irradiation with energy less than 2 95 ev λ 420 nm e in the valence band of bioi will be excited up to a higher conduction band cb potential edge 0 56 v vs sce which is more active than that of tio2 0 16 v vs sce zhang et al 2009 therefore the photoinduced e could easily transfer from cb edge of bioi to the cb edge of tio2 leaving the h on the valence band vb however the redox potential of o2 o2 0 33 v vs nhe was more negative than the cb edge potential of tio2 chen et al 2017 therefore e on the cb of tio2 could hardly reduce o2 into o2 and they will migrate to pt cathode through the external circuit and be continuously consumed via the 4 e oxygen reduction reaction orr o2 4h 4e 2h2o deng et al 2014 2 e o2 o2 3 o2 h ho2 4 2 ho2 1o2 h2o2 pathway iii is that pms itself could play a key role in the 1o2 generation as is well known that pms can generate 1o2 by self decomposition because the oo bonds of pms could be activated by easy energy instead of electron transfer process as depicted in eq 5 but the 1o2 production through pms self decomposition is relatively inefficient evans and upton 1985 most importantly pms will be easier to react with h to form so5 other than react with e to form so4 under visible light irradiation in this reaction system the negatively charged pms molecule would prefer to react with the electron deficient site chen et al 2019 thus h could act as the e deficient center and lead to the oxidation of pms and generation of so5 according to our dft calculation the adsorption energy of pms absorbed on tio2 and bioi were 2 89 ev and 6 06 ev respectively this also demonstrates that pms is more inclined to be absorbed on the bioi surface other than tio2 therefore the anionic pms will interact with positively charged bioi through the electrostatic adsorption and single electron transfer could happen from pms to the h on bioi the generated so5 has longer duration than so4 and so5 will subsequently recombination or react with h2o to form 1o2 as shown in eq 6 8 to further explore the role of h played in the reaction 1 mm edta 2na was added in the epr tests as the quencher of h as shown in fig 7b a much weaker signal of tmp 1o2 result was observed after addition of edta 2na further proving that h played a key role in the 1o2 generation this could also explain the reason that why h made a great contribution to bzf degradation in this system 5 hso5 so5 2 hso4 so4 2 1o2 6 hso5 h so5 h 7 2so5 h2o 1 5 1o2 2hso4 8 so5 so5 1o2 2so4 2 the dmpo oh so4 results were displayed in fig 7d in the absence of pms no oh signals were detected in the dark but the corresponding signal was found under visible light irradiation after the addition of pms the intensity of dmpo oh signal increased slightly while the typical signals for so4 were not found in the epr spectra however several signal peaks in addition to dmpo oh were observed which could be attributed to the hyperfine splitting of dmpo x derived from the fast oxidation of dmpo oh et al 2016 yin et al 2018 the generation of dmpo x can verify the powerful oxidizing capacity of the radicals like so4 generated in the reaction system ding et al 2020 this indicates that the addition of pms enhanced the production of oh also the contribution of so4 to bzf degradation cannot be ignored however there is no obvious increase of dmpo x signal intensity after turning on the light this demonstrates that pms was hard to produce so4 by photoinduced e and only a few amount of so4 may be produced from the pms activation by bioi zhang et al 2017 therefore so4 played a minor role in this reaction system 3 3 2 detection of 1o2 origin in order to investigate the contribution of do to the bzf degradation experiments were conducted in the pfc bioi tna pms vis system with n2 purging do concentration 0 mg l the variation of bzf concentration with addition of specific quenchers in absence of do were shown in fig 8 a the k 60 and total bzf removal efficiencies with different quenchers addition were summarized in table s4 from fig 8 a and table s4 can be seen that the bzf degradation in absence of do k60 0 030 min 1 82 8 degradation was even faster than that in presence of do k60 0 023 min 1 74 8 degradation while 1o2 and h still played the dominated role during degradation compared with the condition in presence of do higher decrease of k60 was observed with meoh addition 47 8 reduction when do 6 mg l 60 0 reduction when do 0 mg l indicating the increased contribution of so4 without do this is due to that do in the solution could compete with pms to acquire e or hinder the adsorption of pms on bioi therefore pms could be adsorbed on the bioi surface much easier and boost the so4 generation without do hso5 e so4 oh moreover the generation of 1o2 from pms self decomposition or the reaction between pms and h could also be enhanced fig 8b shows the pms consumption during reaction in presence or absence of do it can be seen that the pms consumption in absence of do 44 8 consumption was almost 2 2 times higher than that in presence of do 20 4 consumption to deeper investigate the mechanism epr spectra were measured in absence of do and the results were shown in fig 9 a b a strong signal of tmp 1o2 was still observed fig 9a moreover the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 were also observed fig 9b this indicates that 1o2 oh and so4 could still be produced from pms conversion and pms activation can be strengthened without do both the results from fig 8b and fig 9a b demonstrates that the conversion from pms to various ros especially 1o2 and so4 were boosted this is because that when do was excluded from the reaction system pms will be easily close to the catalyst surface especially be absorbed on the bioi surface as photoinduced e on the cb of bioi is able to reduce o2 into o2 do could compete with pms for e which were left on the bioi therefore when do was excluded from the reaction system pms will be activated by e more easily on the bioi surface accordingly the bzf degradation will be enhanced in absence of do 3 4 transformation products and degradation pathways tps of bzf during reaction were identified using lc ms ms detection as shown in table s5 supplementary material the calculated isosurfaces and orbital energies of homo and lumo of bzf was shown in fig 10 a besides in order to figure out the relationship between the ros attack and tps formation quenching experiments were conducted to explore the effect of each ros on tps formation as seen in fig 11 in control group no quencher was added into the solution in group1 10 mm tba was added into the solution before reaction to quench oh in group 2 10 mm meoh was added to quench both oh and so4 in group 3 10 mm meoh and 1 mm furfuryl alcohol ffa were added simultaneously to quench oh so4 and 1o2 thus the effect of h on tps formation could be detected as has been proved that o2 contributed little to bzf degradation the effect of o2 on tps could be ignored in each group samples were withdrawn after 10 min reaction then the tps of each sample were analyzed by lc ms ms system a possible set of reaction pathways consistent with the observed tps were graphically illustrated in fig 10b in general bzf was mainly degraded in pfc bioi tna pms vis system via the following three pathways i hydroxylation oh addition was perceived to occur in the aromatic ring structure which was confirmed by the identified product of tp1 m z 377 razavi et al 2009 wu et al 2019 the isosurface of homo orbital mainly locates on the phenoxyaromatic acid fragment of bzf as shown in fig 10a indicating that such fragment will be more susceptible to be attacked by the electrophilic species like oh so4 1o2 and h further hydroxylation of tp1 will lead to the formation of tp2 m z 393 as seen in fig 11b c tp1 and tp2 formation decreased significantly in group1 and they were even not detected in group2 indicating that tp1 and tp2 was mainly formed from oh attack while so4 made a minor contribution ii the fibrate chain was removed while the hydroxyl group substituted the phenoxy group to form tp4 fibrate chain o c ch3 2cooh could serve as the electron donor as illustrated in table s1 and it exerts a positive influence on the electron density of the connected aromatic ring therefore c16 on the aromatic ring has a much higher homo composition 21 347 and it will be vulnerable for various electrophilic species attack as seen in fig 11 tp4 was confirmed as the dominant tps during bzf degradation tp4 was then oxidized continuously to produce tp5 and tp6 while the continuous fibrate chain substitution of tp2 might also lead to tp 6 formation except for oh attack tp 4 5 and 6 as the phenolic intermediates could also be produced by 1o2 initiated oxidation through the reaction of 1 3 addition 1 4 cycloaddition and 1 2 cycloaddition zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2019b after that tp6 underwent a ringopening reaction and can be further oxidized to form tp7 as seen in fig 11 the formation amount of tp4 5 and 6 was significantly decreased in group3 compared with other groups indicating that 1o2 attack made a major contribution to the pathway from bzf to tp6 besides there was no obvious change of tp7 formation in each group indicating that h oxidation made a primary contribution to tp7 formation iii the fracture of amino bond will lead to the formation of tp3 as the n9 atom could contribute to homo and lumo orbital both electrophilic reaction and nucleophilic reaction may happen on this site and cause the amino bond broken as little formation of tp3 was observed in each group transformation from bzf to tp3 may be the minor pathway of bzf degradation finally the above intermediates could be mineralized into smaller intermediates or directly into co2 and h2o 3 5 photo electrochemical performance and power generation the overall photo electrochemical activity of the tna and bioi tna photoanodes were assed using a typical three electrode photo electrochemical cell irradiated using a visible light simulator at a power intensity of 100 mw cm 2 fig 12 a shows the results of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis analysis generally a lower arc radius in eis indicated a lower resistance value which facilitates the separation of photoinduced e h pairs ângelo et al 2016 the arc radius of bioi tna was smaller with respect to tna when exposed to visible light and a much smaller arc radius was observed when 0 25 mm pms was added into the pfc system in addition a 0 069 v bzf oxidizing peak is observed in the cyclic voltammetry curve shown in fig 12b in which bioi tna with pms addition exhibits the strongest current signal when bzf was oxidized this could further prove that the bzf oxidation could be greatly enhanced when pms was introduced into the reaction power generation of the various pfc systems were assessed by measuring the polarization curve i e voltage vs current density and determining the maximum power density as shown in fig 12c d when using bioi tna as photoanode a much higher open circuit potential and maximum power density up to 0 22 v and 4 6 mw m 2 were observed besides both the open circuit potential and maximum power density concomitantly increased from 0 22 to 0 27 v and 4 6 to 8 2 mw m 2 when 0 25 mm pms was introduced into the pfc system additionally a 2 8 times higher photocurrent response was detected after pms addition as shown in fig s9 supplementary material accordingly pms in electrolyte could serve as a good e acceptor and reduce the internal resistance facilitating the e transportation photocurrent flow increase and bzf oxidation simultaneously the power generation of pfc could be strongly enhanced besides the power generation of pfc bioi tna pms vis system without na2so4 addition as electrolyte was also conducted and the results were shown in fig s10 a high open circuit potential and maximum power density up to 0 23 v and 7 6 mw m 2 was still observed without electrolyte na2so4 addition demonstrating that pms itself could act as an electrolyte and maintain the high power generation of pfc bioi tna pms vis system based on all the results above the possible mechanism for the pollutant decomposition and power generation in the pfc bioi tna pms vis system was proposed and illustrated in scheme 1 the enhanced catalytic performance and power generation could be mainly attributed to three reasons first much more ros in the pfc system were produced after pms addition than that of conventional pfc process especially 1o2 oh and so4 due to the strong redox ability of oh so4 tang et al 2018 and longer half life and higher selectivity of 1o2 scully and hoigne 1987 pfc bioi tna pms vis system exhibits the enhanced bzf degradation performance second as pms was more inclined to interact with h on the bioi surface and the competition of pms with do for e mainly happened on the cb of bioi other e transferred to the tna will efficiently move to pt cathode through the external circuit therefore a higher electric current at the external circuit is simultaneously generated due to the amplified potential difference between photoanode and cathode also the e consumption of pfc was accelerated after pms addition 4 conclusion this study demonstrated that bzf which is recalcitrant to biodegradation and direct photodegradation could be degraded efficiently in effluent through the combination of pfc system and pms activation under visible light pfc bioi tna pms vis system a 4 6 times higher k60 and 1 8 times higher maximum power generation was achieved in this system compared with the single pfc bioi tna vis system the quencher tests revealed that 1o2 played a key role in bzf degradation and reaction between pms and h was confirmed as the major pathway of 1o2 generation because the negative charged hso5 was more inclined to interact with positive charged h rather than e the epr tests revealed that pms addition could promote the generation of 1o2 oh and so4 while o2 could hardly be produced additionally n2 purging tests revealed that pms and dissolved oxygen do could compete for reacting with e on the more negative conduction band of bioi to form oh and so4 while other e transferred to tna through p n junction will efficiently move to cathode through external circuit three bzf degradation pathways in this reaction system have also been proposed including hydroxylation fibrate chain substituent and amino bond fracture notably a much higher photo electrochemical performance and power production were achieved in pfc bioi tna pms vis system which could be attributed to the enlarged ros formation extra h consumption and efficient e separation and transfer all the results confirmed that the pfc bioi tna pms vis system proposed in this study is suitable for actual application with high efficiency and low energy consumption future study should pay more attention to the treatment of real target effluent by this proposed system declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

is also increasing because of the growth of arid regions artiola et al 2019 in terms of geochemistry changes in ionic strength affect physical processes including flocculation adsorption and precipitation duinker et al 1979 huangfu et al 2019 2013 krachler et al 2012 millward 1995 morris et al 1982 physicochemical changes occur where there is the largest relative change in ionic strength sunda and huntsman 1994 1988 sunda and kieber 1994 for example the most rapid rate of change in the complexation of metal species by organic material occurs over an ionic strength range of 0 100 mm coincidently nano particulate materials only remain stable against aggregation at low 1 10 mm ionic strengths christian et al 2008 huangfu et al 2019 mantoura et al 1978 increasing ionic strength destabilizes trace metal binding by organic material as predicted by the irving william series irving and williams 1953 in favor of complexes with the higher concentration alkali earth metals nevertheless a continuous availability of organic material results in trace metals being more likely to remain in the dissolved form cherkasova et al 2021 ionic strength increases when seawater s p 35 equivalent ionic strength i 0 7 m and salinized soil and ground waters mix with fresher waters including river soil groundwater and rainwater in an estuary the i s p rapidly changes by over two orders of magnitude when salinity increases from 0 06 to 6 i s p 1 2 120 mm this change occurs in a predictable temporal manner due to tidal flow geochemical changes at salinities less than s p 5 i s p 100 mm are different from those at higher salinities because the values of the activity coefficients of ions are lower buffle 2006 duinker et al 1979 mantoura et al 1978 stumm and morgan 1996 ultimately changes at low ionic strength promote transformations of redox active species manganese cycling has a suite of characteristics with which to understand the geochemical behavior of environmental systems manganese fractionation transformation between soluble particulate forms provides information on speciation there are three relatively stable environmental manganese species manganese ii manganese iii stabilized in organic complexes mn iii l and particulate manganese iii iv oxides mno x as manganese oxidation and reduction reactions are generally single electron transfers the manganese cycle converges through manganese iii luther 1990 in oxygenated systems manganese is not significantly affected by oxygen concentration stumm and morgan 1996 von langen et al 1997 therefore generally manganese ii oxidation is either microbially clement et al 2009 emerson et al 1982 or surface catalysed manganese ii desorption adsorption is faster than surface oxidation richard et al 2013 the particulate species mno x is an oxidant and binds organic and inorganic ions within its matrix and on its surface manganese oxide reduction through reductive dissolution occurs during organic material oxidation li et al 2021 the resultant manganese iii intermediate species disproportionates davies 1969 but is also readily stabilised by organic ligands klewicki and morgan 1998 rice 1898

strength gradients could also be classed as critical redox active boundary therefore characterising the manganese cycle in low ionic strength systems allows for an understanding of the processes that affect soil mineralogy biome and soil and groundwater during seawater inundation and soil salinization in arid regions artiola et al 2019 li et al 2021 our work applies a fine resolution sampling

dissolved manganese dmnt and organically complexed manganese iii extractable by the siderophore deferoxamine b dfob mn iii ldfob jones et al 2019b samples were collected during six eulerian studies in

1 location sampling and statistical method the columbia river estuary fig 1 funnels water into the north east pacific from a 680 000 km2 catchment the spring freshet following the seasonal snowmelt dominates the columbia river flow fig 1 overlying the seasonal flow is the dynamic change in estuarine height from spring to neap tides the neap tide affects a greater geographical range kärnä et al 2015 estuarine ionic strength is under continuous flux at an eulerian point it represents a balance between the strength of the outflowing low ionic strength river water and inflowing high ionic strength seawater controlled by the tidal phase seawater s density is greater than river water and this property results in a layered structuring to the water column and vertical changes in ionic strength this structuring is termed stratification with low density freshwater layered above high density saltwater and turbulent mixing between the stratified layers samples were taken across steep gradients at low ionic strength and measured for pmnrctv mno x dmnt and mn iii ldfob table 1 for balance tidal phases were sampled at different periods of river flow during the spring freshet high flow in 2012 and at low river flow in september 2012 and august 2013 fig 1 samples were collected into acid washed 125 ml polycarbonate bottles from a continuous flow of pumped water from either the near bottom 8 1 8 6 m or near surface 0 3 m the pump system was situated on a pontoon 400 m from shore 46 2036 n 123 7586 e two 50 ml aliquots were vacuum filtered through 0 2 μm whatman track etched polycarbonate membranes one aliquot was used for the analyses of the pmnrctv and dmnt pair and the second aliquot for the mno x and mn iii ldfob pair retentates and filtrates respectively the mn iii ldfob samples were immediately fixed by adding dfob to a final concentration of 20 μm jones et al 2019b and frozen freezing limits manganese ii reactions faulkner et al 1994 for the preservation of dmnt we added hydroxylamine hydrochloride to a concentration of 14 4 mm then 2 μl of 6 m nitric acid hno3 per 1 ml of sample filters for pmnrctv were wrapped in aluminium foil and frozen filters for mno x were assayed soon after processing the center for coastal margin observation and prediction cmop observatory station monitored for salinity dissolved oxygen temperature turbidity ph and cdom coloured dissolved organic material 2 2 analytical methods the mn iii dfob complex and dmnt samples were diluted ten fold with 1 hno3 and analyzed using an agilent 7700 icp ms the detection limit for manganese in deionized water was 0 15 nm manganese 1 5 nm for diluted samples the recovery of the national research council of canada certified reference material crm for trace metals in estuarine

these samples were incubated in the dark at room temperature for one week while periodically shaking after removing the filters and centrifuging the solutions 1 75 ml of the supernatant was collected the assay for dmnt and the pmnrctv supernatant was the established formaldoxime method supporting information brewer and spencer 1971 and goto et al 1962 the methods limit of detection was 43 nm however concentration of the sample through filtration resulted in a relative detection limit of 2 nm sample reproducibility was 5 rsd 2 2 2 mno x and mn iii dfob the mno x analysis used the highly specific colourimetric probe leucoberbelin blue lbb supporting information altmann 1972 and jones et al 2019a the analytical range for standards within a 100 cm long wave capillary cell was 10 400 nm and the limit of detection was 6 7 nm which when corrected for the volume passed through the filter was 0 54 nm samples were measured in triplicate with an average rsd of 0 44 the mn iii l was

operationally define this extracted fraction as mn iii ldfob manganese ii concentrations were calculated as the difference between dmnt and mn iii ldfob for icp ms analyses the rsd was 10 for repeated analyses n 38 of an estuarine crm the analytical detection limit for flow injection spectrometry was 0 09 nm rsd 5 2 2 3 manganese interferences there can be an overestimation of mn iii ldfob in fresh and very low ionic strength samples because of the presence of manganese ii and colloidal nanoparticulate mno x duckworth and sposito 2005b 2005a jensen et al 2021 romano et al 2017 soldatova et al 2019 manganese ii can form the mn ii hdfob complex this undergoes oxic oxidation to mn iii dfob the formation of mn ii hdfob is unfavourable because of the rapid initial processing low sample temperature chromatography 4 c and sample ph phnbs 8 02 0 22 faulkner et al 1994 jones et al 2019b moreover the formation kinetics of mn ii hdfob are depressed by calcium and magnesium ions wuttig et al 2013 and their concentration in river water is 30 fold that of the final dfob concentration bollens et al 2021 fuhrer et al 1996 finally there is no evidence that mn ii hdfob is retained during chromatography therefore we do not expect a significant interference from manganese ii in the mn iii ldfob technique jones et al 2019b following the addition of dfob to a filtered sample any mno x in the sample because it was smaller than the membrane pore size 0 2 μm will undergo reductive dissolution and the excess dfob forms complexes with the subsequently produced manganese iii duckworth and sposito 2005b unless ultra filtration techniques separate manganese iii and nanoparticulate mno x zhou et al 2016 from within fresh and very low ionic strength water the sensitive manganese iii analytical techniques jones et al 2019b 2019a oldham et al 2015 thibault de chanvalon and luther 2019 will be influenced by small size fraction mno x however even low concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions induce mno x to precipitate perez benito et al 1989 preventing colloidal interference should colloidal manganese interference be likely li et al 2018 it is possible to calculate at higher concentrations the soluble fraction s oxidation state using lbb zhu et al 2017 or leucocrystal violet kessick et al 1972 though iron ii iii fractions can be extracted by the dfob technique which limits the effectiveness of dfob iron s 2 10 times lower concentration than manganese suggests it is unlikely to affect extraction bruland et al 2008 nevertheless nanoparticulate and colloidal iron 0 2 μm may affect manganese fractionation as they could provide surfaces reactive mineral matrix for manganese precipitation and species transformation 2 3 statistical methods the strength of the relationships in the association between manganese species and between manganese species and in situ measured parameters tables a1 a2 and fig a1 was investigated by applying the non parametric spearman s rank correlation spearman s rank was used because the manganese species concentrations independent variable did not have a normal distribution and though the concentrations were expected to change monotonically they were likely to do so in a non linear fashion statistical analysis was performed using microsoft excel the spearman correlation coefficient rs was calculated on each unique sample set year river flow tidal regime and whether it was a surface or bottom sample the probability limit of significance was p 0 054 95 for correlations in two tailed tests we use descriptors for the test statistic rs these are for n 10 moderate 0 4 rs 0 6 strong 0 6 rs 0 8 and very strong rs 0 8 and for n 10 moderate 0 6 rs 0 8 and strong rs 0 8 3 results the columbia river estuary is characterized by large fluctuations and ranges in physical properties and conservative chemical concentrations because of the mixing of seawater with outflowing river water rates and magnitudes of ionic strength change are controlled by the tidal height and river flow velocity while freshwater seawater density affects stratification the sampling times were chosen because the balance between the river flow and tidal phase produced the greatest sample coverage across small changes in ionic strength measured physicochemical variables did not significantly vary between tidal phases tables a1 a2 and fig a1 however variations in manganese speciation were observed and controlled by both river flow and tidal phase table 2 figs 2 4 the changes in total manganese below an ionic strength of 320 mm highlight the variability within the system while above 320 mm there is an external input of soluble manganese that undergoes microbial oxidation to mno x ackroyd et al 1986 klinkhammer and mcmanus 2001 laslett and balls 1995 morris et al 1982 paucot and wollast 1997 3 1 particulate manganese pmnrctv and mno x in 2012 table 2 fig 2 the mean pmnrctv concentration during the neap tide was 681 66 nm surface and 343 31 nm bottom and during the spring tide it was 389 66 nm surface and 485 111 nm bottom under low river flow of the same year table 2 fig 3 and irrespective of the tidal regime the pmnrctv concentrations were lower by approximately a factor of nine surface and four bottom the following year under low river flow and on the spring tide table 2 fig 4 there was 387 188 nm surface and 424 122 nm bottom while concentrations on the neap tide fig 4 were lower by approximately 70 122 50 nm surface and 180 108 nm bottom the mno x concentration during high river flow in 2012 was similar across tidal regime and depth table 2 fig 2 its mean 99 17 nm provides the river water mno x concentration for the theoretical dilution line section 3 3 mixing concentrations under the 2012 low river flow figs 2 vs 3 were lower by 50 surface to 60 bottom and tidally induced variations were absent the following year under low river flow fig 4 mno x exhibited variation between tidal regimes 89 22 nm versus 66 23 nm fig 4 but as with the previous year fig 3 there was little variation in concentration with depth in general particulate mno x appears homogeneously distributed in columbia river waters during high flow mno x accounted for on average 23 11 32 of pmnrctv while during low flow the contribution was higher on average 51 in surface waters and 37 in bottom waters table 2 the mno x concentrations are higher than concentrations in surface and intermediate waters of the saguenay fjord and st lawrence estuary canada but lower than in their respective bottom waters jones et al 2019b 2019a 3 2 soluble manganese dmnt and mn iii ldfob the average dmnt concentration during high river flow table 2 fig 2 was 22 nm while under low river flow the concentration was between 2 and 20 times higher fig 3 the highest dmnt concentrations 1200 nm was during the 2012 low river flow neap tide in the bottom water fig 3 in 2013 the low flow dmnt concentrations fig 4 were lower than in 2012 however the ratio of the mean concentration from the surface to bottom water remained consistent at 0 25 generally mn iii ldfob concentrations were low relative to pmnrctv mno x and dmnt figs 2 4 under high river flow fig 2 there was on average 4 5 2 0 nm mn iii ldfob this value was used as the river water mn iii dfob concentration section 3 3 mixing under low river flow fig 3 mn iii ldfob mean concentrations were higher up to 20 nm surface and 11 nm bottom in 2013 the mean concentrations were similar to 2012 but the concentrations were higher in the bottom water 26 nm than at the surface 11 nm fig 4 for both years under low river flow mn iii ldfob during the spring tide was 40 lower than during the neap tide the highest concentration of mn iii ldfob 114 nm was during the 2013 low flow neap tide within the bottom water fig 4 the mn iii ldfob concentrations were higher than those measured using the same technique in higher salinity waters in the st lawrence estuary and saguenay fjord jones et al 2019b the mn iii ldfob was lower than mn iii l concentrations as measured using the porphyrin technique when applied to a humic rich estuary oldham et al 2017 but on par with mn iii l as measured using lbb on saguenay fjord samples jones et al 2019a during high river flow mn iii ldfob accounted for 20 of dmnt while during low river flow it accounted for 23 surface and 12 bottom table 2 there was low inter annual variability in the contribution of mn iii ldfob to dmnt as the following year the mn iii ldfob contribution was similar 22 surface and 15 bottom table 2 the percentage contribution of the mn iii ldfob is similar to the unknown but dfob complex forming manganese fraction measured by geißler et al 2021 in a mid salinity system 3 3 mixing the theoretical dilution line represents the change in the concentration of an analyte per unit increase in salinity i e dilution of freshwater with seawater conservative mixing will show a linear change in analyte concentration versus salinity if an analyte deviates from a linear relationship then processes other than dilution are at work the theoretical dilution line for temperature and percentage oxygen saturation are linear conservative mixing fig 5 theoretical dilution curves were drawn for mno x and mn iii ldfob using their high flow mean river water concentration and their seawater concentration sections 3 1 and 3 2 river water was sampled in 2012 and seawater in 2013 outside the columbia river plume figs 1 5 and a2 the slope of the theoretical dilution line for mno x from freshwater 99 17 nm to seawater 2 0 0 24 nm was 2 8 nm s p 1 and for mn iii ldfob from freshwater 4 5 2 0 nm to seawater 0 21 0 12 nm was 0 12 nm s p 1 seawater samples were not measured for dmnt and pmnrctv the non linearity of the mno x and mn iii ldfob concentrations versus salinity compared to their theoretical dilution lines show those species are controlled by processes in addition to dilution oxidised manganese species in either fraction appear to be involved in multiple loss production reduction oxidation cycles within the ranges i sp 5 10 mm s p 0 25 0 5 16 80 mm s p 0 8 4 0 and 20 480 mm s p 1 24 fig 5 3 4 total manganese mnt the total manganese mnt dissolved particulate does not include manganese held within strong mineral matrices e g silicates below i s p 160 mm s p 8 mnt ranged between 150 and 400 nm on mixing of river and estuarine water there were four maxima the first maximum was in relatively freshwater i s p 1 25 mm the others were at i s p 5 20 and 80 mm respectively fig 6 a a final maximum was at i s p 320 mm which coincides with the well studied estuarine turbidity maximum the general relative changes in manganese speciation within mnt between i s p 5 and 300 mm are 1 total manganese was dominated by pmnrctv up to i s p 20 above this threshold manganese ii became the dominant species fig 6b between i s p 5 and 300 mm pmnrctv the relative concentration of pmnrctv remains reasonably invariant accounting for 40 of mnt while manganese ii increases from 10 to 40 of mnt also at i s p 20 mno x began its relative gradual decrease with increasing isp relatively speaking this decrease is from 30 to 15 mnt finally mn iii ldfob gradually increases from 5 to 10 of mnt as i s p increases from 5 to 160 mm and then subsequently decreases fig 6b 4 discussion the estuarine paradigm suggests the flocculation of manganese at low salinities s p 5 sholkovitz 1976 results in downstream precipitation to and reduction in sediments tidal pumping then forces soluble manganese into the water column in the middle estuary a soluble manganese maximum is usually coupled with a particulate maximum and makes up the estuarine turbidity maximum klinkhammer and mcmanus 2001 morris et al 1982 ouddane et al 1997 paucot and wollast 1997 in the columbia river the middle estuarine particulate maximum likely occurs because of bacterial oxidation of dissolved manganese and the suspension of bottom water particulates ackroyd et al 1986 klinkhammer and mcmanus 2001 laslett and balls 1995 morris et al 1982 paucot and wollast 1997 the paradigm does not take into account processes occurring at s p 5 though there are numerous direct or indirect photochemical processes affecting manganese speciation barbeau 2006 barbeau et al 2001 hansard et al 2011 sunda et al 1983 sunda and huntsman 1994 photochemistry is unlikely to affect manganese cycling in the columbia river estuary because of the strong light attenuation in the estuarine waters klinkhammmer and mcmanus 2001 in terms of day versus night we observed similar patterns of behavior for mno x mn iii l and manganese ii in surface and bottom waters figs 2 and a3 and invariant concentrations of mno x during daylight hours the mnt shows evidence of external process fig 6 for example a significant input of manganese ii above i s p 320 mm as manganese ii increases from 350 to 900 nm the high i s p manganese ii input is likely from sediments and arrives because of tidal pumping during high river flow external inputs are minimised and changes in salinity were low salinity range s p 0 024 to 0 095 i s p 1 2 to 4 75 mm table a1 however within the high flow salinity range mnt fluctuated by up to 200 nm fig 6a though seasonality affects river water total manganese concentrations those concentrations are not significantly affected interannually joung and shiller 2016 therefore 2012 and 2013 low flow mnt concentrations between i s p 5 to 300 mm should be similar during low flow the magnitude of change in mnt below i s p 320 mm was similar to that during high flow fig 6a fluctuating by 100 to 200 nm this similarity suggests that because we were eulerian sampling we measured the same body of water as it moved forward and backwards with the tide therefore the relative change in manganese species during eulerian sampling of a water parcel should be a robust diagnostic tool to help interpret the processes occurring 4 1 the low salinity estuary isp 1 80 mm s p 0 05 4 the columbia river provides manganese to the low salinity estuary in three forms pmnrctv most likely manganese ii carbonate ouddane et al 1997 mno x and dmnt figs 2 4 upon mixing of river water with seawater estuary water the change in manganese speciation as a function of i sp measured at high resolution followed a pattern the first stage occurred at a low i s p 1 3 mm section 4 1 1 and the second stage occurred at a mildly higher i s p 5 80 mm section 4 1 2 each stage consisted of a pmnrctv production and removal cycle fig 5 within these cycles we categorize new manganese as those species formed in situ for example even though mno x enters via the river it is the new mno x that is formed following the in situ oxidation of reduced manganese 4 1 1 isp 1 3 mm before a measurable effect of mixing with seawater the river water manganese was observed on multiple occasions to be dominated by reduction processes fig 5 in the surface waters during the high flow spring tide the concentrations of the soluble fraction manganese were all positively correlated with each other table 3 this relationship is increasing dmnt predominantly due to the formation of manganese ii with higher mn iii ldfob augmenting dmnt we propose that these waters would not have been affected by manganese ii from sedimentary pore waters because high flow increases stratification which limits mixing chawla et al 2008 kärnä et al 2015 we also believe photochemistry was not significant in these waters section 4 moreover manganese ii associated with the particulate small size fraction and potentially manganese iii carbonates are unlikely to desorb because there was no measurable change in ionic strength apps and wilkin 2015 ouddane et al 1999 increasing manganese ii requires mn iii ldfob reduction however mn iii ldfob remained at a near constant concentration therefore both mn iii ldfob and mno x must be undergoing reduction simultaneously fig 5 with mno x reduction maintaining the mn iii ldfob concentration we suggest that the mn iii ldfob signal was primarily manganese iii and not nanoparticulate mno x because if the mn iii ldfob signal was nanoparticulate mno x a strong correlation between the mnox and mn iii ldfob signals should occur fig 2 it does not in bottom waters and as ionic strength tripled i s p 1 3 mm s p 0 052 0 16 manganese ii increased fig 3 tables 3 and 4 these waters are distant from the estuarine turbidity maximum fig 5 so the signal is unlikely to be because of a tidal efflux of porewaters the increase is likely because of both manganese reduction and seawater ion induced desorption at low i s p the majority of pmnrctv in the low salinity columbia river estuary is likely manganese ii carbonate garnier et al 1996 ouddane et al 1999 1997 the dissolution of pmnrctv manganese ii carbonate on the addition of marine to river water occurs at i s p 200 mm and this release results in elevated soluble manganese ii lin et al 2012 ouddane et al 1999 the reduction of soluble manganese iii in addition to increased soluble fraction manganese was observed in surface and bottom waters while in the bottom waters the reduction occurred from the particulate into the soluble fraction figs 3 4 and 6 these results suggest that at low ionic strengths in natural systems only small increases in ionic strength i s p 4 mm s p 0 2 enhances both manganese reducing conditions and manganese dissolution in contrast there was some enhanced flocculation which leads to the oxidation of organics by mno x though within this isp range the adsorption of organics is low wang et al 2019 nevertheless the i sp change appears sufficient to alter mineral surface characteristics inducing mno x reductive dissolution likely through organic material absorption dissolution combined with desorption may therefore increase manganese ii transfer to the soluble fraction this suggests a direct control based on the effective size of the analyte of interest wollast et al 1979 the reductive dissolution leads to redox reactive therefore transient manganese iii at i s p 4 mm jones et al 2019a luther et al 2015 4 1 2 isp 4 80 mm a broad range of manganese speciation changes occurred within the i s p range of 4 80 mm within this range the actual changes occurred over narrower ionic strength windows for example in the 2012 surface water pmnrctv and mno x increased as i s p increased from 5 to 10 mm s p 0 25 0 5 and from 16 to 30 mm s p 0 8 1 5 fig 3 indicating manganese ii oxidation in contrast and at a higher ionic strength in the extensively surveyed 2013 low flow spring tide bottom water i s p 4 220 mm s p 0 2 11 table 4 and figs 4 and 6 manganese ii and pmnrctv increased with salinity while mno x decreased table 4 and figs 4 and 6 increasing pmnrctv is evidence of growth through flocculation and precipitation and adsorption of manganese ii between i s p 4 and 20 mm the observations are consistent with a fast adsorption followed by slower oxidation richard et al 2013 from i s p 10 mm s p 0 5 pmnrctv was likely removed through either sedimentation or reduction the latter leads to increased manganese ii contrasting pmnrctv removal is the formation of mno x manganese oxide formation is inferred to cause increased pmnrctv however in fig 6 the concentration of mno x is shown to stabilize as ionic strength increases from i s p 10 to 80 mm while the concentration of pmnrctv remains invariant significantly the relative contribution of mno x decreased fig 6 the mno x in the 2013 bottom water during both the spring tide and neap tides decreased from 75 22 nm i s p 20 80 mm s p 1 0 4 0 to 45 10 nm i s p 80 mm s p 4 0 figs 4 and 6 tables 2 and 3 the decrease is unlikely dilution but more likely reductive dissolution because this is the range where rapid organic material and mno x interactions will likely occur mantoura et al 1978 tu et al 1994 wang et al 2019 increasing pmnrctv was likely due to an increase in particle bound manganese ii following reductive dissolution the rate of attachment of manganese ii to particle surfaces is strongly dependent on the concentration of divalent cations and within the milli molar range these cations will strongly suppress any attachment tu et al 1994 wang et al 2019 the transformation of estuarine organic material will also affect manganese ii with humic acid complexes likely in freshwaters and fulvic acid complexes in estuarine seawater gamble et al 1976 hopwood et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 the proximity of organics and manganese ii is beneficial for oxic bacterial manganese oxidation clement et al 2009 and abiotic manganese oxidation because when manganese ii shares electrons with an organic ligand it is more susceptible to direct oxygen oxidation luther 1990 nevertheless multidentate ligands may also suppress manganese ii oxidation morgan et al 2021 however we did not discover whether the adsorbed manganese was within inorganic potentially carbonates ouddane et al 1999 tessier et al 1979 or organic complexes hopwood et al 2015 or simply surface adsorbed richard et al 2013 measuring only the change in pmnrctv misses the underlying redox conditions of the environment because it is often assumed for an oxidising environment that increased pmnrctv is because of increased mno x but this doesn t have to be the case very low ionic strengths will significantly change reactive geochemical processes by controlling the partitioning between particles and solutes not just in estuaries but soils aquifers and deep sediments church 1986 4 2 low salinity to estuarine turbidity maxima isp 80 mm s p 4 observations at the high end of the low salinity manganese cycle i s p 80 mm s p 4 indicate that mno x decreases while mn iii l increases this occurred simultaneously for both years under low flow and on the neap tide figs 3 5 and table 4 above i s p 80 mm mn iii l increases because 1 the stability constant of the organic complex likely increase and this prevents further oxidation of manganese iii beyer jr and fridovich 1989 jones et al 2019a oldham et al 2015 parker et al 2004 and 2 the organic complexes are nearing equilibrium with respect to the ion exchange between the manganese and seawater sourced magnesium and calcium as those complexes seek to become electrically neutral mantoura et al 1978 as mno x accounted for only 20 60 of pmnrctv the majority of pmnrctv was adsorbed manganese ii manganese ii was also the main component of and accounted for the higher dmnt fig 5 and table 2 nevertheless mn iii ldfob may also have increased due to oxidation of manganese ii at particle surfaces morgan 2000 richard et al 2013 or through microbial catalysis

ii jones et al 2019a sun et al 2015 additionally degradation of the ligand complex results in the formation of mno x and manganese ii through disproportionation davies 1969 as i s p increases towards i s p 320 440 mm s p 16 22 dmnt and mno x increase and concurrently mn iii ldfob is removed fig 5 the high i s p zone is the location of the traditional estuarine turbidity maximum with part of this turbidity influenced by the manganese cycle that initiated from the initial mixing of freshwater and seawater 5 conclusion in the upper columbia river estuary a comprehensive analysis of manganese speciation within a robust framework of physical and chemical measurements has shown that significant cycling of manganese occurs in the low ionic strength zone that encompasses the region between freshwater and the estuarine turbidity maximum the manganese chemistry is most likely controlled because of small changes in ionic strength influencing physical processing for example flocculation adsorption and precipitation as ionic strength increases from i s p 1 1 mm to i s p 30 mm s p 0 057 1 5 there is both a reduction of mno x and release of surface associated mn iii l and manganese ii resulting in higher concentrations of reactive mn iii l and manganese ii the mn iii l is further reduced to manganese ii between i s p 20 and 80 mm s p 1 4 soluble manganese ii adsorbs onto particle surfaces oxidation of the adsorbed manganese leads to new mno x formation which precipitates and undergoes a secondary reduction increasing the soluble manganese concentration by understanding how low salinity induced ionic strength controls manganese cycling we can extrapolate this behavior to other natural waters with i s p gradients where ionic strengths are low i s p 80 mm the novel manganese cycling in low i s p waters directly affects a systems redox chemistry a chemistry more important than any bulk water heterogeneity micić et al 2019 the knowledge of how small salinity changes affect manganese solubilization combined with an improved understanding of the physical effect of sea level rise induced flooding izaditame et al 2021 contributes to a greater understanding of the role

16498,mixing of waters of different ionic strengths induces the geochemical cycling of reactive elements the most reactive zone is where the gradient in ionic strength is steepest in oxygenated systems the redox active metal manganese cycles between soluble and particulate fractions through three oxidation states manganese ii manganese iii and manganese iv this cycling strongly affects the mobility of inorganic and organic chemicals the most accessible environmental system where waters with different ionic strengths mix are estuaries during six eulerian studies in the columbia river estuary each up to 26 h we measured manganese speciation and concentration across a salinity s p gradient centred around s p 0 06 6 equivalent to a seawater ionic strength i s p of 1 2 120 mm this zone representing the region between freshwater and the more intensively studied estuarine turbidity maximum presents a highly dynamic geochemical environment in which the manganese cycle propagates through four steps as i s p increases due to mixing 1 before a measurable change in i s p manganese as particulate manganese iii iv oxides mno x undergoes reduction independent of photochemical processes to soluble manganese iii stabilized in organic complexes mn iii l and manganese ii 2 as i s p increases between 5 and 80 mm mn iii l reduction continues and manganese ii adsorbs onto particle surfaces 3 as i s p increases further though remaining below 80 mm s p 4 adsorbed manganese ii desorbs and or is oxidized and is released as mn iii l or oxidises further to mno x 4 the breakdown of mn iii l complexes leads to higher manganese ii and mno x which at mid estuary salinities i s p 320 480 mm precipitates this manganese cycling in low i s p waters directly affects a

coincidently nano particulate materials only remain stable against aggregation at low 1 10 mm ionic strengths christian et al 2008 huangfu et al 2019 mantoura et al 1978 increasing ionic strength destabilizes trace metal binding by organic material as predicted by the irving william series irving and williams 1953 in favor of complexes with the higher concentration alkali earth metals nevertheless a continuous availability of organic material results in trace metals being more likely to remain in the dissolved form cherkasova et al 2021 ionic strength increases when seawater s p 35 equivalent ionic strength i 0 7 m and salinized soil and ground waters mix with fresher waters including river soil groundwater and rainwater in an estuary the i s p rapidly changes by over two orders of magnitude when salinity increases from 0 06 to 6 i s p 1 2 120 mm this change occurs in a predictable temporal manner due to tidal flow geochemical changes at salinities less than s p 5 i s p 100 mm are different from those at higher salinities because the values of the activity coefficients of ions are lower buffle 2006 duinker et al 1979 mantoura et al 1978 stumm and morgan 1996 ultimately changes at low ionic strength promote transformations of redox active species manganese cycling has a suite of characteristics with which to understand the geochemical behavior of environmental systems manganese fractionation transformation between soluble particulate forms provides information on speciation there are three relatively stable environmental manganese species manganese ii manganese iii stabilized in organic complexes mn iii l and particulate manganese iii iv oxides mno x as manganese oxidation and reduction reactions are generally single electron transfers the manganese cycle converges through manganese iii luther 1990 in oxygenated systems manganese is not significantly affected by oxygen concentration stumm and morgan 1996 von langen et al 1997 therefore generally manganese ii oxidation is either microbially clement et al 2009 emerson et al 1982 or surface catalysed manganese ii desorption adsorption is faster than surface oxidation richard et al 2013 the particulate species mno x is an oxidant and binds organic and inorganic ions within its matrix and on its surface manganese oxide reduction through reductive dissolution occurs during organic material oxidation li et al 2021 the resultant manganese iii intermediate species disproportionates davies 1969 but is also readily stabilised by organic ligands klewicki and morgan 1998 rice 1898

1 location sampling and statistical method the columbia river estuary fig 1 funnels water into the north east pacific from a 680 000 km2 catchment the spring freshet following the seasonal snowmelt dominates the columbia river flow fig 1 overlying the seasonal flow is the dynamic change in estuarine height from spring to neap tides the neap tide affects a greater geographical range kärnä et al 2015 estuarine ionic strength is under continuous flux at an eulerian point it represents a balance between the strength of the outflowing low ionic strength river water and inflowing high ionic strength seawater controlled by the tidal phase seawater s density is greater than river water and this property results in a layered structuring to the water column and vertical changes in ionic strength this structuring is termed stratification with low density freshwater layered above high density saltwater and turbulent mixing between the stratified layers samples were taken across steep gradients at low ionic strength and measured for pmnrctv mno x dmnt and mn iii ldfob table 1 for balance tidal phases were sampled at different periods of river flow during the spring freshet high flow in 2012 and at low river flow in september 2012 and august 2013 fig 1 samples were collected into acid washed 125 ml polycarbonate bottles from a continuous flow of pumped water from either the near bottom 8 1 8 6 m or near surface 0 3 m the pump system was situated on a pontoon 400 m from shore 46 2036 n 123 7586 e two 50 ml aliquots were vacuum filtered through 0 2 μm whatman track etched polycarbonate membranes one aliquot was used for the analyses of the pmnrctv and dmnt pair and the second aliquot for the mno x and mn iii ldfob pair retentates and filtrates respectively the mn iii ldfob samples were immediately fixed by adding dfob to a final concentration of 20 μm jones et al 2019b and frozen freezing limits manganese ii reactions faulkner et al 1994 for the preservation of dmnt we added hydroxylamine hydrochloride to a concentration of 14 4 mm then 2 μl of 6 m nitric acid hno3 per 1 ml of sample filters for pmnrctv were wrapped in aluminium foil and frozen filters for mno x were assayed soon after processing the center for coastal margin observation and prediction cmop observatory station monitored for salinity dissolved oxygen temperature turbidity ph and cdom coloured dissolved organic material 2 2 analytical methods the mn iii dfob complex and dmnt samples were diluted ten fold with 1 hno3 and analyzed using an agilent 7700 icp ms the detection limit for manganese in deionized water was 0 15 nm manganese 1 5 nm for diluted samples the recovery of the national research council of canada certified reference material crm for trace metals in estuarine

these samples were incubated in the dark at room temperature for one week while periodically shaking after removing the filters and centrifuging the solutions 1 75 ml of the supernatant was collected the assay for dmnt and the pmnrctv supernatant was the established formaldoxime method supporting information brewer and spencer 1971 and goto et al 1962 the methods limit of detection was 43 nm however concentration of the sample through filtration resulted in a relative detection limit of 2 nm sample reproducibility was 5 rsd 2 2 2 mno x and mn iii dfob the mno x analysis used the highly

operationally define this extracted fraction as mn iii ldfob manganese ii concentrations were calculated as the difference between dmnt and mn iii ldfob for icp ms analyses the rsd was 10 for repeated analyses n 38 of an estuarine crm the analytical detection limit for flow injection spectrometry was 0 09 nm rsd 5 2 2 3 manganese interferences there can be an overestimation of mn iii ldfob in fresh and very low ionic strength samples because of the presence of manganese ii and colloidal nanoparticulate mno x duckworth and sposito 2005b 2005a jensen et al 2021 romano et al 2017 soldatova et al 2019 manganese ii can form the mn ii hdfob complex this undergoes oxic oxidation to mn iii dfob the formation of mn ii hdfob is unfavourable because of the rapid initial processing low sample temperature chromatography 4 c and sample ph phnbs 8 02 0 22 faulkner et al 1994 jones et al 2019b moreover the formation kinetics of mn ii hdfob are depressed by calcium and magnesium ions wuttig et al 2013 and their concentration in river water is 30 fold that of the final dfob concentration bollens et al 2021 fuhrer et al 1996 finally there is no evidence that mn ii hdfob is retained during chromatography therefore we do not expect a significant interference from manganese ii in the mn iii ldfob technique jones et al 2019b following the addition of dfob to a filtered sample any mno x in the sample because it was smaller than the membrane pore size 0 2 μm will undergo reductive dissolution and the excess dfob forms complexes with the subsequently produced manganese iii duckworth and sposito 2005b unless ultra filtration techniques separate manganese iii and nanoparticulate mno x zhou et al 2016 from within fresh and very low ionic strength water the sensitive manganese iii analytical techniques jones et al 2019b 2019a oldham et al 2015 thibault de chanvalon and luther 2019 will be influenced by small size fraction mno x however even low concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions induce mno x to precipitate perez benito et al 1989 preventing colloidal interference should colloidal manganese interference be likely li et al 2018 it is possible to calculate at higher concentrations the soluble fraction s oxidation state using lbb zhu et al 2017 or leucocrystal violet kessick et al 1972 though iron ii iii fractions can be extracted by the dfob technique which limits the effectiveness of dfob iron s 2 10 times lower concentration than manganese suggests it is unlikely to affect extraction bruland et al 2008 nevertheless nanoparticulate and colloidal iron 0 2 μm may affect manganese fractionation as they could provide surfaces reactive mineral matrix for manganese precipitation and species transformation 2 3 statistical methods the strength of the relationships in the association between manganese species and between manganese species and in situ measured parameters tables a1 a2 and fig a1 was investigated by applying the non parametric spearman s rank correlation spearman s rank was used because the manganese species concentrations independent variable did not have a normal distribution and though the concentrations were expected to change monotonically they were likely to do so in a non linear fashion statistical analysis was performed using microsoft excel the spearman correlation coefficient rs was calculated on each unique sample set year river flow tidal regime and whether it was a surface or bottom sample the probability limit of significance was p 0 054 95 for correlations in two tailed tests we use descriptors for the test statistic rs these are for n 10 moderate 0 4 rs 0 6 strong 0 6 rs 0 8 and very strong rs 0 8 and for n 10 moderate 0 6 rs 0 8 and strong rs 0 8 3 results the columbia river estuary is characterized by large fluctuations and ranges in physical properties and conservative chemical concentrations because of the mixing of seawater with outflowing river water rates and magnitudes of ionic strength change are controlled by the tidal height and river flow velocity while freshwater seawater density affects stratification the sampling times were chosen because the balance between the river flow and tidal phase produced the greatest sample coverage across small changes in ionic strength measured physicochemical variables did not significantly vary between tidal phases tables a1 a2 and fig a1 however variations in manganese speciation were observed and controlled by both river flow and tidal phase table 2 figs 2 4 the changes in total manganese below an ionic strength of 320 mm highlight the variability within the system while above 320 mm there is an external input of soluble manganese that undergoes microbial oxidation to mno x ackroyd et al 1986 klinkhammer and mcmanus 2001 laslett and balls 1995 morris et al 1982 paucot and wollast 1997 3 1 particulate manganese pmnrctv and mno x in 2012 table 2 fig 2 the mean pmnrctv concentration during the neap tide was 681 66 nm surface and 343 31 nm bottom and during the spring tide it was 389 66 nm surface and 485 111 nm bottom under low river flow of the same year table 2 fig 3 and irrespective of the tidal regime the pmnrctv concentrations were lower by approximately a factor of nine surface and four bottom the following year under low river flow and on the spring tide table 2 fig 4 there was 387 188 nm surface and 424 122 nm bottom while concentrations on the neap tide fig 4 were lower by approximately 70 122 50 nm surface and 180 108 nm bottom the mno x concentration during high river flow in 2012 was similar across tidal regime and depth table 2 fig 2 its mean 99 17 nm provides the river water mno x concentration for the theoretical dilution line section 3 3 mixing concentrations under the 2012 low river flow figs 2 vs 3 were lower by 50 surface to 60 bottom and tidally induced variations were absent the following year under low river flow fig 4 mno x exhibited variation between tidal regimes 89 22 nm versus 66 23 nm fig 4 but as with the previous year fig 3 there was little variation in concentration with depth in general particulate mno x appears homogeneously distributed in columbia river waters during high flow mno x accounted for on average 23 11 32 of pmnrctv while during low flow the contribution was higher on average 51 in surface waters and 37 in bottom waters table 2 the mno x concentrations are higher than concentrations in surface and intermediate waters of the saguenay fjord and st lawrence estuary canada but lower than in their respective bottom waters jones et al 2019b 2019a 3 2 soluble manganese dmnt and mn iii ldfob the average dmnt concentration during high river flow table 2 fig 2 was 22 nm while under low river flow the concentration was between 2 and 20 times higher fig 3 the highest dmnt concentrations 1200 nm was during the 2012 low river flow neap tide in the bottom water fig 3 in 2013 the low flow dmnt concentrations fig 4 were lower than in 2012 however the ratio of the mean concentration from the surface to bottom water remained consistent at 0 25 generally mn iii ldfob concentrations were low relative to pmnrctv mno x and dmnt figs 2 4 under high river flow fig 2 there was on average 4 5 2 0 nm mn iii ldfob this value was used as the river water mn iii dfob concentration section 3 3 mixing under low river flow fig 3 mn iii ldfob mean concentrations were higher up to 20 nm surface and 11 nm bottom in 2013 the mean concentrations were similar to 2012 but the concentrations were higher in the bottom water 26 nm than at the surface 11 nm fig 4 for both years under low river flow mn iii ldfob during the spring tide was 40 lower than during the neap tide the highest concentration of mn iii ldfob 114 nm was during the 2013 low flow neap tide within the bottom water fig 4 the mn iii ldfob concentrations were higher than those measured using the same technique in higher salinity waters in the st lawrence estuary and saguenay fjord jones et al 2019b the mn iii ldfob was lower than mn iii l concentrations as measured using the porphyrin technique when applied to a humic rich estuary oldham et al 2017 but on par with mn iii l as measured using lbb on saguenay fjord samples jones et al 2019a during high river flow mn iii ldfob accounted for 20 of dmnt while during low river flow it accounted for 23 surface and 12 bottom table 2 there was low inter annual variability in the contribution of mn iii ldfob to dmnt as the following year the mn iii ldfob contribution was similar 22 surface and 15 bottom table 2 the percentage contribution of the mn iii ldfob is similar to the unknown but dfob complex forming manganese fraction measured by geißler et al 2021 in a mid salinity system 3 3 mixing the theoretical dilution line represents the change in the concentration of an analyte per unit increase in salinity i e dilution of freshwater with seawater conservative mixing will show a linear change in analyte concentration versus salinity if an analyte deviates from a linear relationship then processes other than dilution are at work the theoretical dilution line for temperature and percentage oxygen saturation are linear conservative mixing fig 5 theoretical dilution curves were drawn for mno x and mn iii ldfob using their high flow mean river water concentration and their seawater concentration sections 3 1 and 3 2 river water was sampled in 2012 and seawater in 2013 outside the columbia river plume figs 1 5 and a2 the slope of the theoretical dilution line for mno x from freshwater 99 17 nm to seawater 2 0 0 24 nm was 2 8 nm s p 1 and for mn iii ldfob from freshwater 4 5 2 0 nm to seawater 0 21 0 12 nm was 0 12 nm s p 1 seawater samples were not measured for dmnt and pmnrctv the non linearity of the mno x and mn iii ldfob concentrations versus salinity compared to their theoretical dilution lines show those species are controlled by processes in addition to dilution oxidised manganese species in either fraction appear to be involved in multiple loss production reduction oxidation cycles within the ranges i sp 5 10 mm s p 0 25 0 5 16 80 mm s p 0 8 4 0 and 20 480 mm s p 1 24 fig 5 3 4 total manganese mnt the total manganese mnt dissolved particulate does not include manganese held within strong mineral matrices e g silicates below i s p 160 mm s p 8 mnt ranged between 150 and 400 nm on mixing of river and estuarine water there were four maxima the first maximum was in relatively freshwater i s p 1 25 mm the others were at i s p 5 20 and 80 mm respectively fig 6 a a final maximum was at i s p 320 mm which coincides with the well studied estuarine turbidity maximum the general relative changes in manganese speciation within mnt between i s p 5 and 300 mm are 1 total manganese was dominated by pmnrctv up to i s p 20 above this threshold manganese ii became the dominant species fig 6b between i s p 5 and 300 mm pmnrctv the relative concentration of pmnrctv remains reasonably invariant accounting for 40 of mnt while manganese ii increases from 10 to 40 of mnt also at i s p 20 mno x began its relative gradual decrease with increasing isp relatively speaking this decrease is from 30 to 15 mnt finally mn iii ldfob gradually increases from 5 to 10 of mnt as i s p increases from 5 to 160 mm and then subsequently decreases fig 6b 4 discussion the estuarine paradigm suggests the flocculation of manganese at low salinities s p 5 sholkovitz 1976 results in downstream precipitation to and reduction in sediments tidal pumping then forces soluble manganese into the water column in the middle estuary a soluble manganese maximum is usually coupled with a particulate maximum and makes up the estuarine turbidity maximum klinkhammer and mcmanus 2001 morris et al 1982 ouddane et al 1997 paucot and wollast 1997 in the columbia river the middle estuarine particulate maximum likely occurs because of bacterial oxidation of dissolved manganese and the suspension of bottom water particulates ackroyd et al 1986 klinkhammer and mcmanus 2001 laslett and balls 1995 morris et al 1982 paucot and wollast 1997 the paradigm does not take into account processes occurring at s p 5 though there are numerous direct or indirect photochemical processes affecting manganese speciation barbeau 2006 barbeau et al 2001 hansard et al 2011 sunda et al 1983 sunda and huntsman 1994 photochemistry is unlikely to affect manganese cycling in the columbia river estuary because of the strong light attenuation in the estuarine waters klinkhammmer and mcmanus 2001 in terms of day versus night we observed similar patterns of behavior for mno x mn iii l and manganese ii in surface and bottom waters figs 2 and a3 and invariant concentrations of mno x during daylight hours the mnt shows evidence of external process fig 6 for example a significant input of manganese ii above i s p 320 mm as manganese ii increases from 350 to 900 nm the high i s p manganese ii input is likely from sediments and arrives because of tidal pumping during high river flow external inputs are minimised and changes in salinity were low salinity range s p 0 024 to 0 095 i s p 1 2 to 4 75 mm table a1 however within the high flow salinity range mnt fluctuated by up to 200 nm fig 6a though seasonality affects river water total manganese concentrations those concentrations are not significantly affected interannually joung and shiller 2016 therefore 2012 and 2013 low flow mnt concentrations between i s p 5 to 300 mm should be similar during low flow the magnitude of change in mnt below i s p 320 mm was similar to that during high flow fig 6a fluctuating by 100 to 200 nm this similarity suggests that because we were eulerian sampling we measured the same body of water as it moved forward and backwards with the tide therefore the relative change in manganese species during eulerian sampling of a water parcel should be a robust diagnostic tool to help interpret the processes occurring 4 1 the low salinity estuary isp 1 80 mm s p 0 05 4 the columbia river provides manganese to the low salinity estuary in three forms pmnrctv most likely manganese ii carbonate ouddane et al 1997 mno x and dmnt figs 2 4 upon mixing of river water with seawater estuary water the change in manganese speciation as a function of i sp measured at high resolution followed a pattern the first stage occurred at a low i s p 1 3 mm section 4 1 1 and the second stage occurred at a mildly higher i s p 5 80 mm section 4 1 2 each stage consisted of a pmnrctv production and removal cycle fig 5 within these cycles we categorize new manganese as those species formed in situ for example even though mno x enters via the river it is the new mno x that is formed following the in situ oxidation of reduced manganese 4 1 1 isp 1 3 mm before a measurable effect of mixing with seawater the river water manganese was observed on multiple occasions to be dominated by reduction processes fig 5 in the surface waters during the high flow spring tide the concentrations of the soluble fraction manganese were all positively correlated with each other table 3 this relationship is increasing dmnt predominantly due to the formation of manganese ii with higher mn iii ldfob augmenting dmnt we propose that these waters would not have been affected by manganese ii from sedimentary pore waters because high flow increases stratification which limits mixing chawla et al 2008 kärnä et al 2015 we also believe photochemistry was not significant in these waters section 4 moreover manganese ii associated with the particulate small size fraction and potentially manganese iii carbonates are unlikely to desorb because there was no measurable change in ionic strength apps and wilkin 2015 ouddane et al 1999 increasing manganese ii requires mn iii ldfob reduction however mn iii ldfob remained at a near constant concentration therefore both mn iii ldfob and mno x must be undergoing reduction simultaneously fig 5 with mno x reduction maintaining the mn iii ldfob concentration we suggest that the mn iii ldfob signal was primarily manganese iii and not nanoparticulate mno x because if the mn iii ldfob signal was nanoparticulate mno x a strong correlation between the mnox and mn iii ldfob signals should occur fig 2 it does not in bottom waters and as ionic strength tripled i s p 1 3 mm s p 0 052 0 16 manganese ii increased fig 3 tables 3 and 4 these waters are distant from the estuarine turbidity maximum fig 5 so the signal is unlikely to be because of a tidal efflux of porewaters the increase is likely because of both manganese reduction and seawater ion induced desorption at low i s p the majority of pmnrctv in the low salinity columbia river estuary is likely manganese ii carbonate garnier et al 1996 ouddane et al 1999 1997 the dissolution of pmnrctv manganese ii carbonate on the addition of marine to river water occurs at i s p 200 mm and this release results in elevated soluble manganese ii lin et al 2012 ouddane et al 1999 the reduction of soluble manganese iii in addition to increased soluble fraction manganese was observed in surface and bottom waters while in the bottom waters the reduction occurred from the particulate into the soluble fraction figs 3 4 and 6 these results suggest that at low ionic strengths in natural systems only small increases in ionic strength i s p 4 mm s p 0 2 enhances both manganese reducing conditions and manganese dissolution in contrast there was some enhanced flocculation which leads to the oxidation of organics by mno x though within this isp range the adsorption of organics is low wang et al 2019 nevertheless the i sp change appears sufficient to alter mineral surface characteristics inducing mno x reductive dissolution likely through organic material absorption dissolution combined with desorption may therefore increase manganese ii transfer to the soluble fraction this suggests a direct control based on the effective size of the analyte of interest wollast et al 1979 the reductive dissolution leads to redox reactive therefore transient manganese iii at i s p 4 mm jones et al 2019a luther et al 2015 4 1 2 isp 4 80 mm a broad range of manganese speciation changes occurred within the i s p range of 4 80 mm within this range the actual changes occurred over narrower ionic strength windows for example in the 2012 surface water pmnrctv and mno x increased as i s p increased from 5 to 10 mm s p 0 25 0 5 and from 16 to 30 mm s p 0 8 1 5 fig 3 indicating manganese ii oxidation in contrast and at a higher ionic strength in the extensively surveyed 2013 low flow spring tide bottom water i s p 4 220 mm s p 0 2 11 table 4 and figs 4 and 6 manganese ii and pmnrctv increased with salinity while mno x decreased table 4 and figs 4 and 6 increasing pmnrctv is evidence of growth through flocculation and precipitation and adsorption of manganese ii between i s p 4 and 20 mm the observations are consistent with a fast adsorption followed by slower oxidation richard et al 2013 from i s p 10 mm s p 0 5 pmnrctv was likely removed through either sedimentation or reduction the latter leads to increased manganese ii contrasting pmnrctv removal is the formation of mno x manganese oxide formation is inferred to cause increased pmnrctv however in fig 6 the concentration of mno x is shown to stabilize as ionic strength increases from i s p 10 to 80 mm while the concentration of pmnrctv remains invariant significantly the relative contribution of mno x decreased fig 6 the mno x in the 2013 bottom water during both the spring tide and neap tides decreased from 75 22 nm i s p 20 80 mm s p 1 0 4 0 to 45 10 nm i s p 80 mm s p 4 0 figs 4 and 6 tables 2 and 3 the decrease is unlikely dilution but more likely reductive dissolution because this is the range where rapid organic material and mno x interactions will likely occur mantoura et al 1978 tu et al 1994 wang et al 2019 increasing pmnrctv was likely due to an increase in particle bound manganese ii following reductive dissolution the rate of attachment of manganese ii to particle surfaces is strongly dependent on the concentration of divalent cations and within the milli molar range these cations will strongly suppress any attachment tu et al 1994 wang et al 2019 the transformation of estuarine organic material will also affect manganese ii with humic acid complexes likely in freshwaters and fulvic acid complexes in estuarine seawater gamble et al 1976 hopwood et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 the proximity of organics and manganese ii is beneficial for oxic bacterial manganese oxidation clement et al 2009 and abiotic manganese oxidation because when manganese ii shares electrons with an organic ligand it is more susceptible to direct oxygen oxidation luther 1990 nevertheless multidentate ligands may also suppress manganese ii oxidation morgan et al 2021 however we did not discover whether the adsorbed manganese was within inorganic potentially carbonates ouddane et al 1999 tessier et al 1979 or organic complexes hopwood et al 2015 or simply surface adsorbed richard et al 2013 measuring only the change in pmnrctv misses the underlying redox conditions of the environment because it is often assumed for an oxidising environment that increased pmnrctv is because of increased mno x but this doesn t have to be the case very low ionic strengths will significantly change reactive geochemical processes by controlling the partitioning between particles and solutes not just in estuaries but soils aquifers and deep sediments church 1986 4 2 low salinity to estuarine turbidity maxima isp 80 mm s p 4 observations at the high end of the low salinity manganese cycle i s p 80 mm s p 4 indicate that mno x decreases while mn iii l increases this occurred simultaneously for both years under low flow and on the neap tide figs 3 5 and table 4 above i s p 80 mm mn iii l increases because 1 the stability constant of the organic complex likely increase and this prevents further oxidation of manganese iii beyer jr and fridovich 1989 jones et al 2019a oldham et al 2015 parker et al 2004 and 2 the organic complexes are nearing equilibrium with respect to the ion exchange between the manganese and seawater sourced magnesium and calcium as those complexes seek to become electrically neutral mantoura et al 1978 as mno x accounted for only 20 60 of pmnrctv the majority of pmnrctv was adsorbed manganese ii manganese ii was also the main component of and accounted for the higher dmnt fig 5 and table 2 nevertheless mn iii ldfob may also have increased due to oxidation of manganese ii at particle surfaces morgan 2000 richard et al 2013 or through microbial catalysis klinkhammer and mcmanus 2001 lin et al 2012 sunda and huntsman 1988 1987 tebo and emerson 1986 before being released to the soluble fraction the type of ligand stabilising mn iii ldfob likely changed from terrestrial humic or fulvic ligands to one unique to estuarine systems li et al 2018 luther et al 2015 mantoura et al 1978 this latter type of ligand likely stabilizes a redox reactive mn iii l species beyer jr and fridovich 1989 jones et al 2018 keiluweit et al 2015 klewicki and morgan 1998 and if formed following mno x reductive dissolution are likely bioavailable and of low molecular organic weight jones et al 2019a sunda and kieber 1994 with a decrease in mno x redox reactive mn iii l replaces mno x as a major redox reactive oxidant and in such a role ultimately forms manganese ii jones et al 2019a sun et al 2015 additionally degradation of the ligand complex results in the formation of mno x and manganese ii through disproportionation davies 1969 as i s p increases towards i s p 320 440 mm s p 16 22 dmnt and mno x increase and concurrently mn iii ldfob is removed fig 5 the high i s p zone is the location of the traditional estuarine turbidity maximum with part of this turbidity influenced by the manganese cycle that initiated from the initial mixing of freshwater and seawater 5 conclusion in the upper columbia river estuary a comprehensive analysis of manganese speciation within a robust framework of physical and chemical measurements has shown that significant cycling of manganese occurs in the low ionic strength zone that encompasses the region between freshwater and the estuarine turbidity maximum the manganese chemistry is most likely controlled because of small changes in ionic strength influencing physical processing for example flocculation adsorption and precipitation as ionic strength increases from i s p 1 1 mm to i s p 30 mm s p 0 057 1 5 there is both a reduction of mno x and release of surface associated mn iii l and manganese ii resulting in higher concentrations of reactive mn iii l and manganese ii the mn iii l is further reduced to manganese ii between i s p 20 and 80 mm s p 1 4 soluble manganese ii adsorbs onto particle surfaces oxidation of the adsorbed manganese leads to new mno x formation which precipitates and undergoes a secondary reduction increasing the soluble manganese concentration by understanding how low salinity induced ionic strength controls manganese cycling we can extrapolate this behavior to other natural waters with i s p gradients where ionic strengths are low i s p 80 mm the novel manganese cycling in low i s p waters directly affects a systems redox chemistry a chemistry more important than any bulk water heterogeneity micić et al 2019 the knowledge of how small salinity changes affect manganese solubilization combined with an improved understanding of the physical effect of sea level rise induced flooding izaditame et al 2021 contributes to a greater understanding of the role manganese plays as a key component of soil s carbon cycle li et al 2021 our observations of manganese cycling in the columbia river estuary offer new insights into redox driving processes occurring

16499,antiviral drugs are among the most common and important classes of pharmaceuticals to treat viral infections however their continuous emission and persistence in the receiving environment has attracted increasing attention about their potential ecological risks here we investigated the occurrence fate and mass load of 9 antiviral drugs for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and hepatitis b in 7 wastewater treatment plants wwtps with different treatment processes in guangdong china totally 8 target antiviral drugs were detected in the wwtps influent wastewater effluent wastewater and sludge with maximal concentrations up to 7624 ng l telbivudine 568 ng l telbivudine and 2013 ng g wet weight telbivudine respectively the removal efficiency varied widely between different antiviral drugs with the mean aqueous removal efficiency and total removal efficiency ranging from 6 2 nevirapine to 100 lamivudine and 1 2 nevirapine to 100 lamivudine respectively mass balance analysis showed that their elimination was mostly attributed to the biodegradation biotransformation the total back estimated usage and emission of 9 target antiviral drugs were 77 8 t y and 13 2 t y in guangdong province china respectively based on the sewage epidemiology approach the consumption and emission of antiviral drugs in seven studied wwtps were ranged at 2 31 mg d 1000 people nevirapine to 4970 mg d 1000 people telbivudine and 0 lamivudine to 900 mg d 1000 people telbivudine respectively preliminary risk assessment showed that the antiviral drugs of zidovudine ritonavir lopinavir and telbivudine in the receiving rivers could pose high ecological risks for aquatic environment the findings from the present study illustrate the persistence of nevirapine in wwtps and provide essential evidence for further study into the development of wastewater treatment technologies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antiviral drugs removal mass load wastewater treatment plants sewage epidemiology 1 introduction antiviral drugs are a class of pharmaceuticals designed to treat viral infections such as influenza herpes hepatitis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids peng et al 2014 de clercq 2002 2007 it is estimated that 250 million people worldwide are living with hepatitis b virus hbv yu et al 2020 and approximately 25 of the global total infection are living in china hou et al 2020 about 32 million chinese suffered from chronic hepatitis b and receiving necessary antiviral treatment liu et al 2019 there are 36 9 million people worldwide living with human immunodeficiency virus hiv tan and wong 2019 and about 27 18 tons of antiviral drugs are consumed everyday by those 19 8 million hiv infectors receiving antiretroviral treatment ncube et al 2018 in china about 126 448 of china s 780 000 persons living with hiv were receiving free antiviral drugs therapy muessig et al 2014 after use the incompletely metabolized parts of antiviral drugs are excreted via urine or feces of the patients and primarily released into the sewage system gurke et al 2015 it has been reported that up to 60 of administered dose of antiviral drugs are excreted by patients ncube et al 2018 similar to other pharmacologically active drugs the antiviral drugs are eventually released into receiving aquatic environments via effluent discharge of wastewater treatment plants wwtps due to the incomplete removal in wwtps nannou et al 2019 for examples previous studies indicated that the removal rates of nevirapine lopinavir efavirenz and zidovudine were lower than 68 abafe et al 2018 prasse et al 2010 wwtps have been identified as the primary sources for the discharge of antiviral drugs into the aquatic environment muriuki et al 2020 the occurrence of antiviral drugs in the environment is recognized as an emerging environmental issue mainly attributed to the highly bioactive and adverse effects of these antiviral drugs on non target organisms jain et al 2013 nannou et al 2020 it has been reported that nevirapine 1 48 μg l 1 and efavirenz 10 3 ng l 1 at the environmentally relevant concentrations can induce liver histological damage to fish oreochromis mossambicus including vacuolation frank necrosis hepatocyte apoptosis and steatosis robson et al 2017 nibamureke et al 2019 after short term 48 h exposure nevirapine 0 5 μg l 1 zidovudine 1 μg l 1 and lamivudine 4 μg l 1 can induce the increase of glutathione s transferase activity of tadpoles rhinella arenarum and cause oxidative stress damage fernández et al 2020 in addition antiviral drugs also produce virus resistance which are similar to the bacterial resistance induced by antibiotics gillman et al 2015 thus the ecosystem alteration and evolution of antiviral resistance strains in animals and humans through the unconscious exposure to trace contaminated water have aroused much concern nannou et al 2020 gillman et al 2015 singer et al 2007 the occurrence and levels of antiviral drugs such as abacavir zidovudine nevirapine ritonavir lamivudine lopinavir and efavirenz have been investigated in the wwtps influent wwtps effluent and surface water samples of some countries such as france south africa germany kenya and finland aminot et al 2015 abafe et al 2018 funke et al 2016 prasse et al 2010 ngumba et al 2016a b in the african region due to extensive usage of antiviral drugs by the 25 4 million hiv infectors who 2020 nevirapine zidovudine lamivudine and efavirenz were extensively detected in the environment with the concentrations up to dozens of μg l in wwtps effluent and river water k oreje et al 2016 abafe et al 2018 peng reported the levels of six antiviral drugs acyclovir ganciclovir esoltamivir ribavirin stavudine and zidovudine used for herpes and hiv treatment in the wastewater landfill leachate river water and reservoir of the pearl river delta peng et al 2014 however the knowledge on the occurrence of antiviral drugs used for hepatitis and aids treatment in wwtps and receiving rivers of china are seldom reported hou investigated the concentrations of lamivudine in the influent from wwtps in 19 cities in southern china hou et al 2020 however previous investigation mostly reported the concentrations of antiviral drugs in the effluents and influents of wwtps muriuki et al 2020 hou et al 2020 the mass load and removal mechanism of them in wwtps have not been reported the objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of 9 antiviral drugs for hepatitis and aids treatment in influent every treatment stage final effluent and sludge from 7 wwtps using different treatment processes in the guangdong province china mass balance and removal fraction of each treatment process stage were analyzed to estimate their mass load and to reveal their removal mechanism for the first time the consumption and emission of these antiviral drugs in the study region were calculated according to their pollution load in 7 selected wwtps the sewage epidemiology method was also utilized to back estimate antiviral drugs usage in local communities the results from this study can facilitate better understanding of the contamination and control of commonly used antiviral drugs in wwtps and receiving rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards reagents and materials the target authentic standards of abacavir efavirenz nevirapine

province south china the basic information of the 7 wwtps is summarized in table 1 the treatment technologies include a2 o anaerobic anoxic oxic modified a2 o unitank combination alternating activated sludge process oxidation ditch mbr membrane bio reactor and cass cyclic activated sludge system the treatment technical flow chart and the sampling points for each wwtp are depicted in fig s3 for each wwtp wastewater of each process stage activated sludge of each biochemical stage and the excess sludge were collected meanwhile surface water and sediment samples in the receiving river of each wwtp were also collected from the upstream and downstream sites of 100 m far from the outlet of each wwtp all samples of each wwtp were collected as 24 h flow integrated composite samples during the period of november in 2020 while the samples of surface water and sediment from receiving river were grabbed once during the sampling day for each type of sample at each sampling site three replicates were collected for each replication the total sampling volume was 1 l for water and approximately 1 l for activated sludge after filtering and 0 5 l for sediment and excess sludge each collected water sample was separately added with 5 methanol v v to suppress microbial growth whereas each sludge sediment sample was separately added with approximately 1 g l sodium azide to inhibit potential microbial activity all collected samples were subsequently placed into cool boxes which were transported to the laboratory as quick as possible upon arrival in the laboratory the water samples were stored in the dark at 4 c and processed within 24 h the sludge and sediment samples were freeze dried and sieved through a 200 mesh sieve after grinding then placed in brown glass bottles and kept in the dark at 20 c until the extraction the basic quality parameters were detected for the effluent wastewater influent wastewater samples of each wwtp and the surface water samples from the receiving

according to the previously reported methods rice et al 2017 the quality parameters of temperature ph values and do dissolved oxygen were measured on site by a multi parameter water quality monitor ysi incorporated usa 2 3 sample extraction and instrumental analysis the target antiviral drugs in wastewater surface water sludge and sediment samples were extracted and detected according to our previously reported methods yao et al 2021 briefly the collected surface water and wastewater samples were filtered through glass fiber filters 0 7 μm whatman gf f uk and accurately spiked with 100 ng mixed internal standards 100 μl 1000 μg l each then 1000 ml of each filtered surface water 500 ml of each filtered effluent wastewater and 100 ml of each filtered influent wastewater were extracted by the solid phase extraction method using tandem oasis hlb 500 mg 6 ml and envi carb 500 mg 6 ml cartridges on the bottom which were preconditioned with 10 ml methanol and 10 ml distilled water in sequence the water samples were introduced to the preconditioned tandem cartridges at a flow rate of 5 10 ml min the retained target antiviral drugs on the oasis hlb cartridge and envi carb cartridge were separately eluted both with 4 ml methanol 3 ml dichloromethane and 3 ml ethyl acetate the eluents from oasis hlb cartridge and envi carb cartridge were mixed and then concentrated to near dryness under gentle nitrogen stream the final extracts were re dissolved in 1 ml methanol and filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon membrane filter then stored at 20 c until instrumental analysis the sludge and sediment samples were extracted by the quechers method briefly 0 5 g of each sludge sample and 2 g sediment sample were separately weighted into polypropylene tubes 50 ml then accurately spiked with 100 ng mixed internal standards 100 μl 1000 μg l each thereafter 5 ml of distilled water and 10 ml of acetonitrile containing 1 acetic acid were added into each tube in sequence and then vortexed for 30 s afterwards the salt kits 1 5 g naac 6 g mgso4 were added and the tubes were immediately shaken by hand for 1 min subsequently the tubes were centrifuged for 10 min and then 7 ml supernatant was transferred to the tubes containing dispersive solid phase extraction reagents 900 mg mgso4 150 mg psa 150 mg c18 the tubes were shaken by hand for 30 s and then centrifuged for 10 min finally 5 ml supernatant was transferred and concentrated to near dryness under gentle nitrogen stream the final extracts were re dissolved in 1 ml methonal and filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon membrane filter and then stored at 20 c until instrumental analysis the target antiviral drugs were analyzed by an agilent 1290 series ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography system coupled to an agilent 6470 series triple quadrupole mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization esi in positive mode uplc esi ms ms the esi operation parameters of gas flow gas temperature sheath gas flow sheath gas temperature nebulized capillary and nozzle voltage were 8 l min 350 c 12 l min 350 c 45 psi 4500 v and 500 v respectively quantitative detection of target antiviral drugs was conducted in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode with the nitrogen gas as collision gas and drying gas the mass condition parameters including mrm ion transitions collision energy and fragmentor for each target antiviral drug are summarized in table s3 chromatographic separation was conducted on an agilent zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 50 mm 2 1 mm 1 8 μm the mobile phases consisted of methanol solvent b and 0 2 formic acid and 5 mm ammonium acetate in distilled water solvent a the injection volume was 5 μl and the chromatography column was maintained at 40 c the gradient elution program of target antiviral drugs is outlined in table s4 the identification of analytes was conducted by comparing the retention times within 0 5 min and ratios within 20 of characteristic precursor product ion transitions between calibration standards and samples the method recoveries method detection limits mdls and method quantitation limits mqls of target antiviral drugs are listed in table s5 for analytes with actual concentration lower than the mqls mqls 2 is used for calculation strict quality assurance and quality control were performed during the analysis for each batch of 9 samples a procedure blank a solvent blank and an independent check standard 100 μg l each were sequentially processed to check for background contamination carryover and instrument performance no target analytes were detected in procedure and solvent blanks 2 4 mass balance and mass load estimation mass balance calculation is an instructive method to estimate mass load and fate of a target compound in wwtp due to their low volatilities the losses of target antiviral drugs into the atmosphere are negligible therefore the mass balance equation can be expressed by the following equations liu et al 2017 subedi and kannan 2014 1 m influent m effluent m sludge m loss 2 m influent c influent f 100 100 s stability 100 100 p spm 1 1000 3 m effluent c effluent f 100 100 p spm 1 1000 4 m sludge c sludge d p sludge 1 mc 10 6 5 p spm c spm m spm v influent c spm m spm v influent c influent 100 where minfluent mg d meffluent mg d and msludge mg d are the mass loads of a target antiviral drug in the influent effluent and excess sludge of each wwtp respectively whereas mloss mg d is the loss of mass load during the whole treatment processes which mainly contributed from the degradation and sorption in each treatment process cinfluent ng l ceffluent ng l and csludge ng g refer to the concentration of each target antiviral drug in the influent effluent and sludge sample respectively f m3 d and dpsludge g d are the daily flow rate of wastewater influent and production of excess sludge over a 24 h period respectively the parameter of stability is the stability change of target antiviral drugs after 72 h measured in this study table s1 mc is the moisture content of excess sludge in the corresponding wwtp pspm is the sorption percentage of target antiviral drugs to suspended particulate matter ng g cspm ng g is the concentration of target antiviral drugs in spm mspm g is the mass of spm analyzed and vinfluent l is the volume of wastewater used to filter out mspm according to eq 1 the fraction mfloss for each target antiviral drug was calculated by the following equation 6 m f loss m influent m effluent m sludge m influent 100 where the mass fraction in the excess sludge mfexcess and mass fraction in the effluent mfeffluent were calculated by msludge minfluent and meffluent minfluent respectively 2 5 sewage epidemiology back calculation according to the sewage epidemiology method the back estimated consumption mg d 1000 people and per capita environmental emission mg d 1000 people of antiviral drugs in community served by each selected wwtp were calculated by the following equations subedi and kannan 2014 7 consumption 1000 people m influent 100 f excretion m w par m w met 1000 population 8 emission 1000 people c effluent f 1000 100 100 p spm c sludge d p sludge 1000 population 1 10 6 where fexcretion is the reported excretion rate of antiviral drug from human body after administration table s1 mwpar and mwmet is the molecular weight of the parent compound and metabolite compound of each antiviral drug population is the community served by each selected wwtp therefore the back estimated usage t y and back estimated emission t y of antiviral drugs in guangdong province and in china were calculated by per capita consumption eq 7 and per capita emission eq 8 and the populations in guangdong province and in china according to the china statistical yearbook of 2020 the population values are 11 521 104 and 140 005 104 persons for guangdong province and china respectively 2 6 ecological risk assessment the aquatic ecological risks of antiviral drugs in the receiving rivers were evaluated through the risk quotient rq approach based on european commission technical guidance document by using eq 9 ec 2003 rq values are calculated by dividing exposure estimates by the acute and chronic eco toxicity values 9 rq m e c p n e c where mec is the measured environmental concentration in the receiving rivers and pnec is the predicted no effect concentration according to the risk ranking criteria rq 0 01 0 01 rq 0 1 0 1 rq 1 and rq 1 indicate minimal risk low risk medium risk and high risk respectively hernando et al 2006 the pnec values can be calculated by the aquatic chronic no observed effect concentration noec or acute median effective concentration ec50 ec 2003 for those target antiviral drugs the obtained pnec values are summarized in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 antiviral drugs in wwtps and their receiving river fig 1 shows the concentration range and detection frequency of 9 target antiviral drug in the influent effluent and sludge samples from seven wwtps in guangdong province china the concentration levels range mean and median for the detected antiviral drugs in water samples are summarized in table s6 and the detailed concentrations in each wwtp and its receiving river are summarized in tables s7 as depicted in fig 1a eight antiviral drugs i e abacavir zidovudine efavirenz nevirapine ritonavir lopinavir lamivudine and telbivudine were found in all selected wastewater influent samples with their mean concentrations ranged at 0 97 3043 ng l while entecavir was not detected in any selected wwtps although the recommended doses of abacavir 600 mg d nevirapine 400 mg d and lopinavir 400 mg d by the chinese guideline of diagnosis and treatment for acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids were almost equal cao et al 2020 the detected concentrations of lopinavir 21 829 ng l were much higher than those of abacavir 2 53 6 15 ng l and nevirapine 0 41 1 59 ng l the results may be attributted to the excretion rate discrepancy between lopinavir 75 abacavir 17 and nevirapine 7 in human body table s1 besides as the recommended drugs by the chinese guideline of prevention and treatment for chronic hepatitis b 600 mg d zhang et al 2014 telbivudine 230 7624 ng l was extensively detected with the highest mean concentrations as summarized in table s8 the wwtps influent concentrations of zidovudine ritonavir and lamivudine in this study were comparable with those in the germany zidovudine 390 ng l switzerland ritonavir 110 ng l and finland lamivudine 55 ng l funke et al 2016 prasse et al 2010 margot et al 2013 ngumba et al 2016b while the wwtps influent concentrations of abacavir zidovudine efavirenz nevirapine ritonavir lopinavir and lamivudine in the present study were much lower than those in the south africa i e 14 000 ng l 53 000 ng l 34 000 ng l 2800 ng l 3200 ng l 2500 ng l and 2200 ng l respectively abafe et al 2018 schoeman et al 2017 it was estimated that approximately 25 4 million people are living with hiv aids in the african region who 2020 which may result in the large usage of antiviral drugs and then high detection concentrations of them in the wwtps as shown in fig 1b seven antiviral drugs were found in wwtp effluents with the detection frequencies of 57 100 while lamivudine and entecavir were not detected in any effluent among these detected antiviral drugs zidovudine efavirenz nevirapine ritonavir lopinavir and telbivudine were frequently detected 100 with the mean concentrations ranged at 1 02 184 ng l abacavir was only partially detected 57 with the mean concentration of 0 25 ng l as a whole lopinavir 6 87 584 ng l and telbivudine 18 8 568 ng l were detected with high mean concentrations while abacavir mdl 1 11 ng l and nevirapine 0 32 1 86 ng l were detected with low mean concentrations in comparison the wwtps effluent concentrations of abacavir zidovudine efavirenz nevirapine ritonavir and lamivudine in the present study were lower than those in the france abacavir 33 ng l south africa eg efavirenz 34 000 ng l nevirapine 1900 ng l ritonavir 1500 ng l germany zidovudine 564 ng l and kenya lamivudine 3985 ng l aminot et al 2015 abafe et al 2018 funke et al 2016 prasse et al 2010 schoeman et al 2017 ngumba et al 2016a whilst the wwtps effluent concentrations of ritonavir zidovudine and efavirenz of the present study were comparable with those in the switzerland finland and the kwazulu natal region of south africa i e ritonavir 90 ng l zidovudine 37 ng l efavirenz 37 3 ng l margot et al 2013 ngumba et al 2016b mlunguza et al 2020 for the receiving surface water eight antiviral drugs were detected with mean concentrations ranged at 0 15 128 ng l for upstream and 0 2 157 ng l for downstream samples generally the concentrations of most detected antiviral drugs at downstream which was affected by the effluent of each wwtp were higher than those at upstream it should be pointed out that lamivudine was not found in the effluent of all selected wwtps but it detected in the upstream 19 7 ng l and downstream 3 58 ng l of surface water of receiving river for plant 7 these results may indicate that there are other emission sources of lamivudine at the upstream of receiving river for plant 7 the detailed concentration of target antiviral drugs in the sludge of each wwtp and sediment of receiving river are summarized in table s9 as depicted in fig 1c five antiviral drugs were detected in the excess sludge of wwtps with the detection frequencies of 71 ritonavir 86 efavirenz and 100 abacavir lopinavir and telbivudine whilst zidovudine nevirapine lamivudine and entecavir were not detected among them the detection concentration of telbivudine 0 54 2013 ng g wet weight was much higher than that of abacavir 0 04 0 09 ng g wet weight similar to the results of wwtp influents and effluents the concentration of efavirenz in the sludge samples of the present study was 10 times lower than those in the south africa schoeman et al 2017 the results indicated that the antiviral drugs can be transported from water phase to sludge phase in wwtps however the concentrations of antiviral drugs in the wwtps sludge in other countries were rarely reported thus the extensive investigation of antiviral drugs in the sludge of wwtp is needed in the future as for the sediment samples of receiving rivers six antiviral drugs were sporadically detected with low mean concentrations both at the upstream 0 04 5 63 ng g wet weight and downstream 0 04 3 87 ng g dry weight samples overall telbivudine and lopinavir were commonly found in the sediment samples of receiving rivers with the concentrations up to 4 40 and 15 8 ng g wet weight respectively 3 2 mass balance analysis as summarized in table 2 for influent the mean daily mass loads of individual antiviral drugs into the wwtps normalized by the population equivalent ranged from 0 30 μg d person nevirapine to 1549 μg d person telbivudine except for lopinavir and telbivudine the daily mass loads of other antiviral drugs were lower than 100 μg d person as a comparison the daily mass loads of zidovudine 3 64 40 1 μg d person nevirapine 0 17 0 43 μg d person and lamivudine 4 99 19 9 μg d person in the present study were 40 1000 and 4 times lower than those in kenya muriuki et al 2020 whilst for the effluent and sludge samples the mean daily mass loads of each antiviral drug into the wwtps normalized by the population equivalent were ranged at 0 lamivudine 175 μg d person telbivudine and 0 zidovudine nevirapine and lamivudine 44 2 μg d person telbivudine respectively according to the principle of mass balance minfluent meffluent msludge mloss the mass loads for input influent and output effluent and sludge were estimated and then the mass loss and the mass fraction results were calculated as shown in fig 2 the mass load of nevirapine was mainly distributed in the effluent and its mass loss part was lower than those for other target antiviral drugs except for telbivudine the mass load fractions of excess sludge for most antiviral drugs in each wwtp were lower than 2 besides the mass loss fractions were mostly over than 50 for abacavir ritonavir and lamivudine and some were even close to 100 which indicated that most treatment processes i e a2 o unitank modified a2 o oxidation ditch and mbr exhibited excellent eliminating efficiencies for these three antiviral drugs furthermore the mass loss fractions for some antiviral drugs displayed negative values which may be attributed to their higher concentrations in effluent than those in influent i e nevirapine and lopinavir or related to their strong adsorption in activated sludge and different sludge removal time i e telbivudine similar to the results of this study negative values of mass loss fraction for some biocides in wwtps were also previously reported liu et al 2017 overall many of antiviral drugs i e zidovudine efavirenz lopinavir and telbivudine are difficult to be degraded and adsorbed during some treatment processes such as modified a2 o oxidation ditch and cass 3 3 removal mechanisms of antiviral drugs in wwtps as displayed in fig 3 for eight target antiviral drugs the mean aqueous removal efficiency and total removal efficiency were at the range of 6 2 nevirapine to 100 lamivudine and 1 2 nevirapine to 100 lamivudine respectively overall the removal efficiency of target antiviral drugs were ordered as abacavir lamivudine ritonavir zidovudine efavirenz telbivudine lopinavir nevirapine as summarized in table s8 similarly the substantial removal for abacavir and lamivudine was also previously reported in the wwtps with conventional activated sludge cas and cas mbr treatment processes i e 75 100 and 76 to 100 funke et al 2016 prasse et al 2010 abafe et al 2018 mosekiemang et al 2019 notably the removal efficiency of lopinavir and ritonavir in wwtps using modified a2 o oxidation ditch and a2 o mbr treatment processes i e 96 98 and 97 99 were obviously improved comparing with those in wwtps using cas treatment process i e 200 to 50 and 25 65 margot et al 2013 abafe et al 2018 furthermore the persistence of efavirenz lopinavir and nevirapine in the effluents was also previously expounded in the wwtps with cas cas mbr a2 o and anaerobic baffled reactor treatment processes i e 38 to 71 200 to 50 and 0 to 48 schoeman et al 2017 mosekiemang et al 2019 prasse et al 2010 abafe et al 2018 for zidovudine nevirapine and lopinavir the removal efficiency exhibited negative values in the wwtps with a2 o unitank and mbr treatment processes in the present study which may attribute to the reconversion of metabolites to their corresponding parent compounds or the unaccounted hydraulic retention time during sampling muriuki et al 2020 mosekiemang et al 2019 schoeman et al 2017 based on the results of statistical analysis the removal efficiency of 8 detected antiviral drugs did not show significant spatial deviations whether in the wwtps located in guangzhou kruskal wallis test p 0 01 or in the wwtps located in shenzhen kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 01 and the removal efficiency of 8 detected antiviral drugs did not show obvious differences between wwtps located in guangzhou and in shenzhen kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 01 as a whole the removal efficiency of various detected antiviral drugs and other water quality parameters i e do bod5 cod tn nh3 n and tp did not show significant variations between 7 studied wwtps kruskal wallis test p 0 01 while the removal efficiency of zidovudine nevirapine ritonavir and lopinavir at 7 wwtps were distributed over a wide range fig 3 which indicated that the elimilation of those antiviral drugs is greatly influenced by the treatment process of wwtps the aqueous removal fractions of target antiviral drugs at each treatment stages of wwtps were depicted at fig s4 in wwtps using a2 o related treatment processes except for nevirapine many antiviral drugs were mostly removed through anaerobic stage and pre anoxic stage with aqueous removal fractions higher than 50 good removal efficiency of anaerobic and anoxic processes for pharmaceuticals such as chloramphenicol and carbamazepine were also previously reported gao et al 2016 in wwtps using unitank and cass treatment process the target antiviral drugs were mostly removed through aeration stage respectively whilst the removal fractions of lopinavir were lower than 50 which may be attributed to the desorption of lopinavir from sludge or the unaccounted hydraulic retention time during sampling muriuki et al 2020 besides except for nevirapine and zidovudine other target antiviral drugs were mostly removed through oxidation ditch process previous studies indicated that nevirapine was resistant to degradation at chlorination disinfection process typically used in wwtps wood et al 2016 schoeman et al 2017 however in the present study the resistance of nevirapine to degradation was observed in the wwtps either by chlorination disinfection or by uv disinfection 3 4 back estimated usage emissions and implication as shown in fig 4 the total back estimated usage of 9 target antiviral drugs was 77 8 t y and the total back estimated emission to the environment was 13 2 t y in guangdong province china assuming that the usage of antiviral drugs per person in other provinces of china is similar to that in guangdong province the national including guangdong back estimated usage and emission were up to 956 5 t y and 161 9 t y respectively these results indicated that about 17 portion of target antiviral drugs were released to the receiving environment the telbivudine ritonavir and lopinavir had high back estimated usage 45 t y for the whole china and emission 2 t y for the whole china which should be concerned by environmental supervision and management department for all the surface water samples n 14 zidovudine ritonavir lopinavir and telbivudine in the receiving rivers could pose high risks to aquatic organisms under the worst case scenario with the fraction of high risk ranged at 14 to 71 table s10 efavirenz could pose medium risks to aquatic organisms under the worst case scenario with the fraction of medium risk to 7 the bioaccumulation and bio toxic effects of antiviral drugs are seldom previously reported however the only existing study indicated that zidovudine can be accumulated by tadpoles rhinella arenarum and cause oxidative stress damage to organism fernández et al 2020 thus the ecological risk of these antiviral drugs to wildlife should be of concern in the future study 3 5 sewage epidemiology consumption and prevalence rate the seven selected wwtps located in the economically developed districts of guangdong province with the serving population ranged at 50 000 to 1 000 000 person table 1 according to the sewage epidemiology approach the estimated consumption and emission of antiviral drugs for wwtps served communities are calculated and summarized in table 3 the consumption of target antiviral drugs in seven studied wwtps ranged from 2 31 mg d 1000 people nevirapine to 4970 mg d 1000 people telbivudine with the average consumption of telbivudine ritonavir and lopinavir estimated to 1549 mg d 1000 people 102 mg d 1000 people and 90 mg d 1000 people respectively in comparison the consumption of lamivudine in this study in guangzhou 25 3 101 mg d 1000 people were comparable with those in other capital cities of china i e chongqing shanghai zhengzhou hangzhou and nanjing which ranged at 32 4 45 2 mg d 1000 people hou et al 2020 however the consumption of zidovudine 7 9 87 2 mg d 1000 people nevirapine 2 31 5 82 mg d 1000 people and lamivudine 25 3 101 mg d 1000 people in the present study were 100 200 and 200 times lower than those in kenya k oreje et al 2016 in addition the emission of target antiviral drugs in 7 studied wwtps ranged from 0 lamivudine to 900 mg d 1000 people telbivudine with the mean emission of telbivudine and lopinavir higher than 40 mg d 1000 people which deserves further attention in comparison the emission of zidovudine 1 25 8 57 mg d 1000 people in this study were close to those in kenya 9 48 mg d 1000 people while the emission of nevirapine 0 09 0 49 mg d 1000 people and lamivudine 0 mg d 1000 people in the present study were much lower than those in kenya i e 221 564 mg d 1000 people and 3250 10 950 mg d 1000 people k oreje et al 2016 the mean prevalence rate of target antiviral drugs in population served by wwtps ranged at 0 1 nevirapine to 25 8 telbivudine based on the result above telbivudine lamivudine and lopinavir were probably the most widely used antiviral drugs by the residents in the wwtps service area of guangzhou and shenzhen china the estimated prevalence of lamivudine in guangzhou 0 84 3 36 and shenzhen 1 21 2 30 in this study were relatively close to those previously reported results 4 hou et al 2020 which indicated that the wastewater based epidemiology is a feasible method to estimating the consumption of antiviral drugs and pharmaceuticals in certain areas on the whole the estimated prevalence results of lamivudine in guangzhou and shenzhen were lower than those previously reported prevalence results in the capital cities of chongqing 5 and zhengzhou 5 but higher than those in the capital cities of guiyang 2 xiamen 2 5 haikou 2 lhasa 1 and wuhan 1 hou et al 2020 4 conclusion among the 9 target antiviral drugs 8 antiviral drugs were frequently found in these 7 wwtps influent wastewater effluent wastewater and sludge abacavir efavirenz ritonavir lopinavir and telbivudine were the predominant detected antiviral drugs the anti hbv drug telbivudine was firstly detected and reported in the wwtps of this study with the detection concentration high to thousands of ng l except for abacavir and lamivudine most of the detected antiviral drugs cannot be completely removed by wwtps with the mean aqueous removal efficiency lower than 70 the persistent emission and existence of nevirapine deserves enough attention in the future study due to the low removal efficiency of it in various currently using wwtps treatment technologies according to sewage epidemiology approach telbivudine ritonavir and lopinavir were calculated as the most widely used antiviral drugs in the wwtps service areas of this study 45 t y for the whole china the discharge of effluent wastewater led to the contamination of antiviral drugs in the receiving rivers and consequently some of them i e zidovudine ritonavir lopinavir and telbivudine caused high ecological risk to aquatic organisms now there are few studies on the occurrence mass loading and ecological risk of antiviral drugs in the aquatic environment all over the world especially in china considering the persistent existence and high risks of antiviral drugs in aquatic environment future studies should pay closely attention to the determination and removal

16499,antiviral drugs are among the most common and important classes of pharmaceuticals to treat viral infections however their continuous emission and persistence in the receiving environment has attracted increasing attention about their potential ecological risks here we investigated the occurrence fate and mass load of 9 antiviral drugs for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and hepatitis b in 7 wastewater treatment plants wwtps with different treatment processes in guangdong china totally 8 target antiviral drugs were detected in the wwtps influent wastewater effluent wastewater and sludge with maximal concentrations up to 7624 ng l telbivudine 568 ng l telbivudine and 2013 ng g wet weight telbivudine respectively the removal efficiency varied widely between different antiviral drugs with the mean aqueous removal efficiency and total removal efficiency ranging from 6 2 nevirapine to 100 lamivudine and 1 2 nevirapine to 100 lamivudine respectively mass balance analysis showed that their elimination was mostly attributed to the biodegradation biotransformation the total back estimated usage and emission of 9 target antiviral drugs were 77 8 t y and 13 2 t y in guangdong province china respectively based on the sewage epidemiology approach the consumption and emission of antiviral drugs in seven studied wwtps were ranged at 2 31 mg d 1000 people nevirapine to 4970 mg d 1000 people telbivudine and 0 lamivudine to 900 mg d 1000 people telbivudine respectively preliminary risk assessment showed that the antiviral drugs of zidovudine ritonavir lopinavir and telbivudine in the receiving rivers could pose high ecological risks for aquatic environment the findings from the present study illustrate the persistence of nevirapine in wwtps and provide essential evidence for further study into the development of wastewater treatment technologies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords antiviral drugs removal mass load wastewater treatment plants sewage epidemiology 1 introduction antiviral drugs are a class of pharmaceuticals designed to treat viral infections such as influenza herpes hepatitis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids peng et al 2014 de clercq 2002 2007 it is estimated that 250 million people worldwide are living with hepatitis b virus hbv yu et al 2020 and approximately 25 of the global total infection are living in china hou et al 2020 about 32 million chinese suffered from chronic hepatitis b and receiving necessary antiviral treatment liu et al 2019 there are 36 9 million people worldwide living with human immunodeficiency virus hiv tan and wong 2019 and about 27 18 tons of antiviral drugs are consumed everyday by those 19 8 million hiv infectors receiving antiretroviral treatment ncube et al 2018 in china about 126 448 of china s 780 000 persons living with hiv were receiving free antiviral drugs therapy muessig et al 2014 after use the incompletely metabolized parts of antiviral drugs are excreted via urine or feces of the patients and primarily released into the sewage system gurke et al 2015 it has been reported that up to 60 of administered dose of antiviral drugs are excreted by patients ncube et al 2018 similar to other pharmacologically active drugs the antiviral drugs are eventually released into receiving aquatic environments via effluent discharge of wastewater treatment plants wwtps due to the incomplete removal in wwtps nannou et al 2019 for examples previous studies indicated that the removal rates of nevirapine lopinavir efavirenz and zidovudine were lower than 68 abafe et al 2018 prasse et al 2010 wwtps have been identified as the primary sources for the discharge of antiviral drugs into the aquatic environment muriuki et al 2020 the occurrence of antiviral drugs in the environment is recognized as an emerging environmental issue mainly attributed to the highly bioactive and adverse effects of these antiviral drugs on non target organisms jain et al 2013 nannou et al 2020 it has been reported that nevirapine 1 48 μg l 1 and efavirenz 10 3 ng l 1 at the environmentally relevant concentrations can induce liver histological damage to fish oreochromis mossambicus including vacuolation frank necrosis hepatocyte apoptosis and steatosis robson et al 2017 nibamureke et al 2019 after short term 48 h exposure nevirapine 0 5 μg l 1 zidovudine 1 μg l 1 and lamivudine 4 μg l 1 can induce the increase of glutathione s transferase activity of tadpoles rhinella arenarum and cause oxidative stress damage fernández et al 2020 in addition antiviral drugs also produce virus resistance which are similar to the bacterial resistance induced by antibiotics gillman et al 2015 thus the ecosystem alteration and evolution of antiviral resistance strains in animals and humans through the unconscious exposure to trace contaminated water have aroused much concern nannou et al 2020 gillman et al 2015 singer et al 2007 the occurrence and levels of antiviral drugs such as abacavir zidovudine nevirapine ritonavir lamivudine lopinavir and efavirenz have been investigated in the wwtps influent wwtps effluent and surface water samples of some countries such as france south africa germany kenya and finland aminot et al 2015 abafe et al 2018 funke et al 2016 prasse et al 2010 ngumba et al 2016a b in the african region due to extensive usage of antiviral drugs by the 25 4 million hiv infectors who 2020 nevirapine zidovudine lamivudine and efavirenz were extensively detected in the environment with the concentrations up to dozens of μg l in wwtps effluent and river water k oreje et al 2016 abafe et al 2018 peng reported the levels of six antiviral drugs acyclovir ganciclovir esoltamivir ribavirin stavudine and zidovudine used for herpes and hiv treatment in the wastewater landfill leachate river water and reservoir of the pearl river delta peng et al 2014 however the knowledge on the occurrence of antiviral drugs used for hepatitis and aids treatment in wwtps and receiving rivers of china are seldom reported hou investigated the concentrations of lamivudine in the influent from wwtps in 19 cities in southern china hou et al 2020 however previous investigation mostly reported the concentrations of antiviral drugs in the effluents and influents of wwtps muriuki et al 2020 hou et al 2020 the mass load and removal mechanism of them in wwtps have not been reported the objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of 9 antiviral drugs for hepatitis and aids treatment in influent every treatment stage final effluent and sludge from 7 wwtps using different treatment processes in the guangdong province china mass balance and removal fraction of each treatment process stage were analyzed to estimate their mass load and to reveal their removal mechanism for the first time the consumption and emission of these antiviral drugs in the study region were calculated according to their pollution load in 7 selected wwtps the sewage epidemiology method was also utilized to back estimate antiviral drugs usage in local communities the results from this study can facilitate better understanding of the contamination and control of commonly used antiviral drugs in wwtps and receiving rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 standards reagents and materials the target authentic standards of abacavir efavirenz nevirapine

province south china the basic information of the 7 wwtps is summarized in table 1 the treatment technologies include a2 o anaerobic anoxic oxic modified a2 o unitank combination alternating activated sludge process oxidation ditch mbr membrane bio reactor and cass cyclic activated sludge system the treatment technical flow chart and the sampling points for each wwtp are depicted in fig s3 for each wwtp wastewater of each process stage activated sludge of each biochemical stage and the excess sludge were collected meanwhile surface water and sediment samples in the receiving river of each wwtp were also collected from the upstream and downstream sites of 100 m far from the outlet of each wwtp all samples of each wwtp were collected as 24 h flow integrated composite samples during the period of november in 2020 while the samples of surface water and sediment from receiving river were grabbed once during the sampling day for each type of sample at each sampling site three replicates were collected for each replication the total sampling volume was 1 l for water and approximately 1 l for activated sludge after filtering and 0 5 l for sediment and excess sludge each collected water sample was separately added with 5 methanol v v to suppress microbial growth whereas each sludge sediment sample was separately added with approximately 1 g l sodium azide to inhibit potential microbial activity all collected samples were subsequently placed into cool boxes which were transported to the laboratory as quick as possible upon arrival in the laboratory the water samples were stored in the dark at 4 c and processed within 24 h the sludge and sediment samples were freeze dried and sieved through a 200 mesh sieve after grinding then placed in brown glass bottles and kept in the dark at 20 c until the extraction the basic quality parameters were detected for the effluent wastewater influent wastewater samples of each wwtp and the surface water samples from the receiving

according to the previously reported methods rice et al 2017 the quality parameters of temperature ph values and do dissolved oxygen were measured on site by a multi parameter water quality monitor ysi incorporated usa 2 3 sample extraction and instrumental analysis the target antiviral drugs in wastewater surface water sludge and sediment samples were extracted and detected according to our previously reported methods yao et al 2021 briefly the collected surface water and wastewater samples were filtered through glass fiber filters 0 7 μm whatman gf f uk and accurately spiked with 100 ng mixed internal standards 100 μl 1000 μg l each then 1000 ml of each filtered surface water 500 ml of each filtered effluent wastewater and 100 ml of each filtered influent wastewater were extracted by the solid phase extraction method using tandem oasis hlb 500 mg 6 ml and envi carb 500 mg 6 ml cartridges on the bottom which were preconditioned with 10 ml methanol and 10 ml distilled water in sequence the water samples were introduced to the preconditioned tandem cartridges at a flow rate of 5 10 ml min the retained target antiviral drugs on the oasis hlb cartridge and envi carb cartridge were separately eluted both with 4 ml methanol 3 ml dichloromethane and 3 ml ethyl acetate the eluents from oasis hlb cartridge and envi carb cartridge were mixed and then concentrated to near dryness under gentle nitrogen stream the final extracts were re dissolved in 1 ml methanol and filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon membrane filter then stored at 20 c until instrumental analysis the sludge and sediment samples were extracted by the quechers method briefly 0 5 g of each sludge sample and 2 g sediment sample were separately weighted into polypropylene tubes 50 ml then accurately spiked with 100 ng mixed internal standards 100 μl 1000 μg l each thereafter 5 ml of distilled water and 10 ml of acetonitrile containing 1 acetic acid were added into each tube in sequence and then vortexed for 30 s afterwards the salt kits 1 5 g naac 6 g mgso4 were added and the tubes were immediately shaken by hand for 1 min subsequently the tubes were centrifuged for 10 min and then 7 ml supernatant was transferred to the tubes containing dispersive solid phase extraction reagents 900 mg mgso4 150 mg psa 150 mg c18 the tubes were shaken by hand for 30 s and then centrifuged for 10 min finally 5 ml supernatant was transferred and concentrated to near dryness under gentle nitrogen stream the final extracts were re dissolved in 1 ml methonal and filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon membrane filter and then stored at 20 c until instrumental analysis the target antiviral drugs were analyzed by an agilent 1290 series ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography system coupled to an agilent 6470 series triple quadrupole mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization esi in positive mode uplc esi ms ms the esi operation parameters of gas flow gas temperature sheath gas flow sheath gas temperature nebulized capillary and nozzle voltage were 8 l min 350 c 12 l min 350 c 45 psi 4500 v and 500 v respectively quantitative detection of target antiviral drugs was conducted in multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode with the nitrogen gas as collision gas and drying gas the mass condition parameters including mrm ion transitions collision energy and fragmentor for each target antiviral drug are summarized in table s3 chromatographic separation was conducted on an agilent zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 50 mm 2 1 mm 1 8 μm the mobile phases consisted of methanol solvent b and 0 2 formic acid and 5 mm ammonium acetate in distilled water solvent a the injection volume was 5 μl and the chromatography column was maintained at 40 c the gradient elution program of target antiviral drugs is outlined in table s4 the identification of analytes was conducted by comparing the retention times within 0 5 min and ratios within 20 of characteristic precursor product ion transitions between calibration standards and samples the method recoveries method detection limits mdls and method quantitation limits mqls of target antiviral drugs are listed in table s5 for analytes with actual concentration lower than the mqls mqls 2 is used for calculation strict quality assurance and quality control were performed during the analysis for each batch of 9 samples a procedure blank a solvent blank and an independent check standard 100 μg l each were sequentially processed to check for background contamination carryover and instrument performance no target analytes were detected in procedure and solvent blanks 2 4 mass balance and mass load estimation mass balance calculation is an instructive method to estimate mass load and fate of a target compound in wwtp due to their low volatilities the losses of target antiviral drugs into the atmosphere are negligible therefore the mass balance equation can be expressed by the following equations liu et al 2017 subedi and kannan 2014 1 m influent m effluent m sludge m loss 2 m influent c influent f 100 100 s stability 100 100 p spm 1 1000 3 m effluent c effluent f 100 100 p spm 1 1000 4 m sludge c sludge d p sludge 1 mc 10 6 5 p spm c spm m spm v influent c spm m spm v influent c influent 100 where minfluent mg d meffluent mg d and msludge mg d are the mass loads of a target antiviral drug in the influent effluent and excess sludge of each wwtp respectively whereas mloss mg d is the loss of mass load during the whole treatment processes which mainly contributed from the degradation and sorption in each treatment process cinfluent ng l ceffluent ng l and csludge ng g refer to the concentration of each target antiviral drug in the influent effluent and sludge sample respectively f m3 d and dpsludge g d are the daily flow rate of wastewater influent and production of excess sludge over a 24 h period respectively the parameter of stability is the stability change of target antiviral drugs after 72 h measured in this study table s1 mc is the moisture content of excess sludge in the corresponding wwtp pspm is the sorption percentage of target antiviral drugs to suspended particulate matter ng g cspm ng g is the concentration of target antiviral drugs in spm mspm g is the mass of spm analyzed and vinfluent l is the volume of wastewater used to filter out mspm according to eq 1 the fraction mfloss for each target antiviral drug was calculated by the following equation 6 m f loss m influent m effluent m sludge m influent 100 where the mass fraction in the excess sludge mfexcess and mass fraction in the effluent mfeffluent were calculated by msludge minfluent and meffluent minfluent respectively 2 5 sewage epidemiology back calculation according to the sewage epidemiology method the back estimated consumption mg d 1000 people and per capita environmental emission mg d 1000 people of antiviral drugs in community served by each selected wwtp were calculated by the following equations subedi and kannan 2014 7 consumption 1000 people m influent 100 f excretion m w par m w met 1000 population 8 emission 1000 people c effluent f 1000 100 100 p spm c sludge d p sludge 1000 population 1 10 6 where fexcretion is the reported excretion rate of antiviral drug from human body after administration table s1 mwpar and mwmet is the molecular weight of the parent compound and metabolite compound of each antiviral drug population is the community served by each selected wwtp therefore the back estimated usage t y and back estimated emission t y of antiviral drugs in guangdong province and in china were calculated by per capita consumption eq 7 and per capita emission eq 8 and the populations in guangdong province and in china according to the china statistical yearbook of 2020 the population values are 11 521 104 and 140 005 104 persons for guangdong province and china respectively 2 6 ecological risk assessment the aquatic ecological risks of antiviral drugs in the receiving rivers were evaluated through the risk quotient rq approach based on european commission technical guidance document by using eq 9 ec 2003 rq values are calculated by dividing exposure estimates by the acute and

ranking criteria rq 0 01 0 01 rq 0 1 0 1 rq 1 and rq 1 indicate minimal risk low risk medium risk and high risk respectively hernando et al 2006 the pnec values can be calculated by the aquatic chronic no observed effect concentration noec or acute median effective concentration ec50 ec 2003 for those target antiviral drugs the obtained pnec values are summarized in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 antiviral drugs in wwtps and their receiving river fig 1 shows the concentration range and detection frequency of 9 target antiviral drug in the influent effluent and sludge samples from seven wwtps in guangdong province china the concentration levels range mean and median for the detected antiviral drugs in water samples are summarized in table s6 and the detailed concentrations in each wwtp and its receiving river are summarized in tables s7 as depicted in fig 1a eight antiviral drugs i e abacavir zidovudine efavirenz nevirapine ritonavir lopinavir lamivudine and telbivudine were found in all selected wastewater influent samples with their mean concentrations ranged at 0 97 3043 ng l while entecavir was not detected in any selected wwtps although the recommended doses of abacavir 600 mg d nevirapine 400 mg d and lopinavir 400 mg d by the chinese guideline of diagnosis and treatment for acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids were almost equal cao et al 2020 the detected concentrations of lopinavir 21 829 ng l were much higher than those of abacavir 2 53 6 15 ng l and nevirapine 0 41 1 59 ng l the results may be attributted to the excretion rate discrepancy between lopinavir 75 abacavir 17 and nevirapine 7 in human body table s1 besides as the recommended drugs by the chinese guideline of prevention and treatment for chronic hepatitis b 600 mg d zhang et al 2014 telbivudine 230 7624 ng l was extensively detected with the highest mean concentrations as summarized in table s8 the wwtps influent concentrations of zidovudine ritonavir and lamivudine in this study were comparable with those in the germany zidovudine 390 ng l switzerland ritonavir 110 ng l and finland lamivudine 55 ng l funke et al 2016 prasse et al 2010 margot et al 2013 ngumba et al 2016b while the wwtps influent concentrations of abacavir zidovudine efavirenz nevirapine ritonavir lopinavir and lamivudine in the present study were much lower than those in the south africa i e 14 000 ng l 53 000 ng l 34 000 ng l 2800 ng l 3200 ng l 2500 ng l and 2200 ng l respectively abafe et al 2018 schoeman et al 2017 it was estimated that approximately 25 4 million people are living with hiv aids in the african region who 2020 which may result in the large usage of antiviral drugs and then high detection concentrations of them in the wwtps as shown in fig 1b seven antiviral drugs were found in wwtp effluents with the detection frequencies of 57 100 while lamivudine and entecavir were not detected in any effluent among these detected antiviral drugs zidovudine efavirenz nevirapine ritonavir lopinavir and telbivudine were frequently detected 100 with the mean concentrations ranged at 1 02 184 ng l abacavir was only partially detected 57 with the mean concentration of 0 25 ng l as a whole lopinavir 6 87 584 ng l and telbivudine 18 8 568 ng l were detected with high mean concentrations while abacavir mdl 1 11 ng l and nevirapine 0 32 1 86 ng l were detected with low mean concentrations in comparison the wwtps effluent concentrations of abacavir zidovudine efavirenz nevirapine ritonavir and lamivudine in the present study were lower than those in the france abacavir 33 ng l south africa eg efavirenz 34 000 ng l nevirapine 1900 ng l ritonavir 1500 ng l germany zidovudine 564 ng l and kenya lamivudine 3985 ng l aminot et al 2015 abafe et al 2018 funke et al 2016 prasse et al 2010 schoeman et al 2017 ngumba et al 2016a whilst the wwtps effluent concentrations of ritonavir zidovudine and efavirenz of the present study were comparable with those in the switzerland finland and the kwazulu natal region of south africa i e ritonavir 90 ng l zidovudine 37 ng l efavirenz 37 3 ng l margot et al 2013 ngumba et al 2016b mlunguza et al 2020 for the receiving surface water eight antiviral drugs were detected with mean concentrations ranged at 0 15 128 ng l for upstream and 0 2 157 ng l for downstream samples generally the concentrations of most detected antiviral drugs at downstream which was affected by the effluent of each wwtp were higher than those at upstream it should be pointed out that lamivudine was not found in the effluent of all selected wwtps but it detected in the upstream 19 7 ng l and downstream 3 58 ng l of surface water of receiving river for plant 7 these results may indicate that there are other emission sources of lamivudine at the upstream of receiving river for plant 7 the detailed concentration of target antiviral drugs in the sludge of each wwtp and sediment of receiving river are summarized in table s9 as depicted in fig 1c five antiviral drugs were detected in the excess sludge of wwtps with the detection frequencies of 71 ritonavir 86 efavirenz and 100 abacavir lopinavir and telbivudine whilst zidovudine nevirapine lamivudine and entecavir were not detected among them the detection concentration of telbivudine 0 54 2013 ng g wet weight was much higher than that of abacavir 0 04 0 09 ng g wet weight similar to the results of wwtp influents and effluents the concentration of efavirenz in the sludge samples of the present study was 10 times lower than those in the south africa schoeman et al 2017 the results indicated that the antiviral drugs can be transported from water phase to sludge phase in wwtps however the concentrations of antiviral drugs in the wwtps sludge in other countries were rarely reported thus the extensive investigation of antiviral drugs in the sludge of wwtp is needed in the future as for the sediment samples of receiving rivers six antiviral drugs were sporadically detected with low mean concentrations both at the upstream 0 04 5 63 ng g wet weight and downstream 0 04 3 87 ng g dry weight samples overall telbivudine and lopinavir were commonly found in the sediment samples of receiving rivers with the concentrations up to 4 40 and 15 8 ng g wet weight respectively 3 2 mass balance analysis as summarized in table 2 for influent the mean daily mass loads of individual antiviral drugs into the wwtps normalized by the population equivalent ranged from 0 30 μg d person nevirapine to 1549 μg d person telbivudine except for lopinavir and telbivudine the daily mass loads of other antiviral drugs were lower than 100 μg d person as a comparison the daily mass loads of zidovudine 3 64 40 1 μg d person nevirapine 0 17 0 43 μg d person and lamivudine 4 99 19 9 μg d person in the present study were 40 1000 and 4 times lower than those in kenya muriuki et al 2020 whilst for the effluent and sludge samples the mean daily mass loads of each antiviral drug into the wwtps normalized by the population equivalent were ranged at 0 lamivudine 175 μg d person telbivudine and 0 zidovudine nevirapine and lamivudine 44 2 μg d person telbivudine respectively according to the principle of mass balance minfluent meffluent msludge mloss the mass loads for input influent and output effluent and sludge were estimated and then the mass loss and the mass fraction results were calculated as shown in fig 2 the mass load of nevirapine was mainly distributed in the effluent and its mass loss part was lower than those for other target antiviral drugs except for telbivudine the mass load fractions of excess sludge for most antiviral drugs in each wwtp were lower than 2 besides the mass loss fractions were mostly over than 50 for abacavir ritonavir and lamivudine and some were even close to 100 which indicated that most treatment processes i e a2 o unitank modified a2 o oxidation ditch and mbr exhibited excellent eliminating efficiencies for these three antiviral drugs furthermore the mass loss fractions for some antiviral drugs displayed negative values which may be attributed to their higher concentrations in effluent than those in influent i e nevirapine and lopinavir or related to their strong adsorption in activated sludge and different sludge removal time i e telbivudine similar to the results of this study negative values of mass loss fraction for some biocides in wwtps were also previously reported liu et al 2017 overall many of antiviral drugs i e zidovudine efavirenz lopinavir and telbivudine are difficult to be degraded and adsorbed during some treatment processes such as modified a2 o oxidation ditch and cass 3 3 removal mechanisms of antiviral drugs in wwtps as displayed in fig 3 for eight target antiviral drugs the mean aqueous removal efficiency and total removal efficiency were at the range of 6 2 nevirapine to 100 lamivudine and 1 2 nevirapine to 100 lamivudine respectively overall the removal efficiency of target antiviral drugs were ordered as abacavir lamivudine ritonavir zidovudine efavirenz telbivudine lopinavir nevirapine as summarized in table s8 similarly the substantial removal for abacavir and lamivudine was also previously reported in the wwtps with conventional activated sludge cas and cas mbr treatment processes i e 75 100 and 76 to 100 funke et al 2016 prasse et al 2010 abafe et al 2018 mosekiemang et al 2019 notably the removal efficiency of lopinavir and ritonavir in wwtps using modified a2 o oxidation ditch and a2 o mbr treatment processes i e 96 98 and 97 99 were obviously improved comparing with those in wwtps using cas treatment process i e 200 to 50 and 25 65 margot et al 2013 abafe et al 2018 furthermore the persistence of efavirenz lopinavir and nevirapine in the effluents was also previously expounded in the wwtps with cas cas mbr a2 o and anaerobic baffled reactor treatment processes i e 38 to 71 200 to 50 and 0 to 48 schoeman et al 2017 mosekiemang et al 2019 prasse et al 2010 abafe et al 2018 for zidovudine nevirapine and lopinavir the removal efficiency exhibited negative values in the wwtps with a2 o unitank and mbr treatment processes in the present study which may attribute to the reconversion of metabolites to their corresponding parent compounds or the unaccounted hydraulic retention time during sampling muriuki et al 2020 mosekiemang et al 2019 schoeman et al 2017 based on the results of statistical analysis the removal efficiency of 8 detected antiviral drugs did not show significant spatial deviations whether in the wwtps located in guangzhou kruskal wallis test p 0 01 or in the wwtps located in shenzhen kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 01 and the removal efficiency of 8 detected antiviral drugs did not show obvious differences between wwtps located in guangzhou and in shenzhen kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 01 as a whole the removal efficiency of various detected antiviral drugs and other water quality parameters i e do bod5 cod tn nh3 n and tp did not show significant variations between 7 studied wwtps kruskal wallis test p 0 01 while the removal efficiency of zidovudine nevirapine ritonavir and lopinavir at 7 wwtps were distributed over a wide range fig 3 which indicated that the elimilation of those antiviral drugs is greatly influenced by the treatment process of wwtps the aqueous removal fractions of target antiviral drugs at each treatment stages of wwtps were depicted at fig s4 in wwtps using a2 o related treatment processes except for nevirapine many antiviral drugs were mostly removed through anaerobic stage and pre anoxic stage with aqueous removal fractions higher than 50 good removal efficiency of anaerobic and anoxic processes for pharmaceuticals such as chloramphenicol and carbamazepine were also previously reported gao et al 2016 in wwtps using unitank and cass treatment process the target antiviral drugs were mostly removed through aeration stage respectively whilst the removal fractions of lopinavir were lower than 50 which may be attributed to the desorption of lopinavir from sludge or the unaccounted hydraulic retention time during sampling muriuki et al 2020 besides except for nevirapine and zidovudine other target antiviral drugs were mostly removed through oxidation ditch process previous studies indicated that nevirapine was resistant to degradation at chlorination disinfection process typically used in wwtps wood et al 2016 schoeman et al 2017 however in the present study the resistance of nevirapine to degradation was observed in the wwtps either by chlorination disinfection or by uv disinfection 3 4 back estimated usage emissions and implication as shown in fig 4 the total back estimated usage of 9 target antiviral drugs was 77 8 t y and the total back estimated emission to the environment was 13 2 t y in guangdong province china assuming that the usage of antiviral drugs per person in other provinces of china is similar to that in guangdong province the national including guangdong back estimated usage and emission were up to 956 5 t y and 161 9 t y respectively these results indicated that about 17 portion of target antiviral drugs were released to the receiving environment the telbivudine ritonavir and lopinavir had high back estimated usage 45 t y for the whole china and emission 2 t y for the whole china which should be concerned by environmental supervision and management department for all the surface water samples n 14 zidovudine ritonavir lopinavir and telbivudine in the receiving rivers could pose high risks to aquatic organisms under the worst case scenario with the fraction of high risk ranged at 14 to 71 table s10 efavirenz could pose medium risks to aquatic organisms under the worst case scenario with the fraction of medium risk to 7 the bioaccumulation and bio toxic effects of antiviral drugs are seldom previously reported however the only existing study indicated that zidovudine can be accumulated by tadpoles rhinella arenarum and cause oxidative stress damage to organism fernández et al 2020 thus the ecological risk of these antiviral drugs to wildlife should be of concern in the future study 3 5 sewage epidemiology consumption and prevalence rate the seven selected wwtps located in the economically developed districts of guangdong province with the serving population ranged at 50 000 to 1 000 000 person table 1 according to the sewage epidemiology approach the estimated consumption and emission of antiviral drugs for wwtps served communities are calculated and summarized in table 3 the consumption of target antiviral drugs in seven studied wwtps ranged from 2 31 mg d 1000 people nevirapine to 4970 mg d 1000 people telbivudine with the average consumption of telbivudine ritonavir and lopinavir estimated to 1549 mg d 1000 people 102 mg d 1000 people and 90 mg d 1000 people respectively in comparison the consumption of lamivudine in this study in guangzhou 25 3 101 mg d 1000 people were comparable with those in other capital cities of china i e chongqing shanghai zhengzhou hangzhou and nanjing which ranged at 32 4 45 2 mg d 1000 people hou et al 2020 however the consumption of zidovudine 7 9 87 2 mg d 1000 people nevirapine 2 31 5 82 mg d 1000 people and lamivudine 25 3 101 mg d 1000 people in the present study were 100 200 and 200 times lower than those in kenya k oreje et al 2016 in addition the emission of target antiviral drugs in 7 studied wwtps ranged from 0 lamivudine to 900 mg d 1000 people telbivudine with the mean emission of telbivudine and lopinavir higher than 40 mg d 1000 people which deserves further attention in comparison the emission of zidovudine 1 25 8 57 mg d 1000 people in this study were close to those in kenya 9 48 mg d 1000 people while the emission of nevirapine 0 09 0 49 mg d 1000 people and lamivudine 0 mg d 1000 people in the present study were much lower than those in kenya i e 221 564 mg d 1000 people and 3250 10 950 mg d 1000 people k oreje et al 2016 the mean prevalence rate of target antiviral drugs in population served by wwtps ranged at 0 1 nevirapine to 25 8 telbivudine based on the result above telbivudine lamivudine and lopinavir were probably the most widely used antiviral drugs by the residents in the wwtps service area of guangzhou and shenzhen china the estimated prevalence of lamivudine in guangzhou 0 84 3 36 and shenzhen 1 21 2 30 in this study were relatively close to those previously reported results 4 hou et al 2020 which indicated that the wastewater based epidemiology is a feasible method to estimating the consumption of antiviral drugs and pharmaceuticals in certain areas on the whole the estimated prevalence results of lamivudine in guangzhou and shenzhen were lower than those previously reported prevalence results in the capital cities of chongqing 5 and zhengzhou 5 but higher than those in the capital cities of guiyang 2 xiamen 2 5 haikou 2 lhasa 1 and wuhan 1 hou et al 2020 4 conclusion among the 9 target antiviral drugs 8 antiviral drugs were frequently found in these 7 wwtps influent wastewater effluent wastewater and sludge abacavir efavirenz ritonavir lopinavir and telbivudine were the predominant detected antiviral drugs the anti hbv drug telbivudine was firstly detected and reported in the wwtps of this study with the detection concentration high to thousands of ng l except for abacavir and lamivudine most of the detected antiviral drugs cannot be completely removed by wwtps with the mean aqueous removal efficiency lower than 70 the persistent emission and existence of nevirapine deserves enough attention in the future study due to the low removal efficiency of it in various currently using wwtps treatment technologies according to sewage epidemiology approach telbivudine ritonavir and lopinavir were calculated as the most widely used antiviral drugs in the wwtps service areas of this study 45 t y for the whole china the discharge of effluent wastewater led to the contamination of antiviral drugs in the receiving rivers and consequently some of them i e zidovudine ritonavir lopinavir and telbivudine caused high ecological risk to aquatic organisms now there are few studies on the occurrence mass loading and ecological risk of antiviral drugs in the aquatic environment all over the world especially in china considering the persistent existence and high risks of antiviral drugs in aquatic environment future studies should pay closely attention to the determination and removal
