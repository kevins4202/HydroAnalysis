13685,the removal of heavy metals from natural mining or industrial ponds or water flows is a problem for metallurgical industries the reason is that heavy metals represent a risk for the health of people living close to these industries one of these heavy metals is copper whose removal was widely studied using different aluminous materials clays zeolites smectites or power plant ashes in this manuscript a different aluminous material is proposed to remove copper from water the bayer process electrostatic precipitator microparticles bpem the bpem mainly consists of alpha alumina min 6 5 and max 53 aluminum hydrates min 12 and max 72 and intermediate or gamma alumina the adsorption of cu2 by different bpems was studied using nuclear magnetic resonance nmr technique the nmr 1h and 27al spectra were tested to identify the presence of oxides and hydroxides and their bonding structures and how the spectra varied once the copper had been captured by the bpems a huge attenuation of the 1h spectrum was found in all the studied bpems when copper is adsorbed there does not seem to be any cu2 adsorbed related to 27al although some spectra show a slight attenuation of the corresponding peak but not comparable with that observed in the case of the 1h thus cu fixation is produced by replacement of hydrogen bonding present on the surface of the hydrated alumina by the cu cations keywords aluminum alumina bayer process wastewater copper 1 introduction the removal of heavy metals from natural mining or industrial ponds or water flows can be carried out by different methods some of physical nature and others using chemical processes not based on the adsorption process 1 4 the importance of removing heavy metals ions is related with their association with health hazards for all living organisms due to their toxicity and non biodegradable nature 5 7 there are several techniques to remove heavy metals and other hazardous materials from wastewaters 8 including chemical precipitation reverse osmosis ion exchange and adsorption 5 however the adsorption on clay and other chemical substances has special interest due to its effectiveness using low cost and environmentally friendly materials 5 it is possible to identify within the aluminous materials used as adsorbents clays 5 9 10 zeolites 11 13 smectites 14 power plant ashes 15 16 etc the metal adsorption by one of these aluminous materials is a physical chemical process by which under certain conditions an active solid the adsorbent can fix metal ions or gas molecules in gases the adsorbate on its surface when placed in close contact with the fluid carrying them in solution or when in intimate mixture as with gases the adsorption of heavy metal cations depends on many factors the nature of the adsorbent the nature of the adsorbate as well as the volume and ion concentration in solution the solution adsorbent mass rate ph temperature contact time and stirring rate there are several adsorption time curves which represent the quantity of material that is adsorbed as a function of the time and allow knowing the capacity of certain materials to adsorb heavy metals the utilization of bayer process electrostatic precipitator microparticles bpem is proposed in this manuscript with the aim of giving a new use to an industrial residue produced in the alumina industry one necessary issue is to know the type of bonding that appears when metal cu cation is adsorbed on the surface of the adsorbate bpem and this is the target of the present work the present study will provide the bonding mechanism and therefore how durable the adsorbent adsorbate bonding will be when using bpem the study has been carried out using the nuclear magnetic resonance nmr technique 2 characterization of the bpem the bpem is a waste generated during the production of alumina from bauxite ore in the bayer process 17 after the coarse alumina hydrate calcination the electrostatic classification results in alumina and bpem as residue the novelty of the present study is precisely the utilization of the bpem as adsorbent for copper cations fixation from wastewater dried alumina hydrate is calcined to obtain al2o3 at temperatures in the range 900 1200 c generally in fluid bed furnaces metallurgical grade alumina and bpem as waste are obtained in this process temperature and time of calcination will determine the quality of the obtained product in the coarse alumina hydrate calcination α alumina is produced when the alumina hydrate is calcined at 1200 c however most of the alumina is γ alumina when the calcination is at around 1000 c this alumina has fluorine gases chemisorption capacity alumina experiences metastable transformations at different temperatures to give so called transition alumina phases γ θ χ η ρ δ κ 18 it is necessary to point out the existence of these aluminas because they are very active in the capture of metal ions and are involved in metal adsorption phenomena even when the bpem residue produced in bayer plants is similar in all of them in this manuscript bpem wastes from different bayer plants were used dadco stade germany alteo gardanne france rio tinto vaudreuil jonquiere canada rusal aughinish ireland barcarena hydro alunorte brazil alcoa san ciprián lugo spain and the worsley alumina group australia the alumina production capacity in the factory of alcoa of san ciprián lugo galicia spain is 1 mt sandy alumina quality few calcined with α alumina content 10 which gives as a result 100 000 tons of bpem every year this gives a reference value of the amount of bpem generated in the production of metallurgical grade alumina the chemical composition of the bpem was determined by icp ms results are collected in table 1 the values of the real density were obtained by means of the helium pycnometer autopycnometer 1320 of micromeritics results are collected in table 2 the specific surface area was determined by means of the volume of nitrogen gas absorbed by the samples at the temperature of the liquid nitrogen bet using a surface analyzer of area rapid surface area analyzer model 2200a of micromeritics samples were degasified with nitrogen during 30 min at 200 c results are collected in table 2 the value of the diameter of particle d50 obtained from the grain size distribution using the lumosed is collected in table 2 bpems are characterized by their high hydrate gibbsite content and certain alpha and gamma alumina contents the waste was analyzed using the x ray diffraction technique philips pw 1729 1710 equipment and panalyticalx pert pro to match the peaks different types of alumina were identified mainly alpha and gamma alumina although the greatest content corresponded to the alpha and gamma alumina and gibbsite thermal analysis technique mettler toledo dsc822e equipment used was used to identify the quantity of aluminum trihydrate gibbsite nitrogen atmosphere 50 ml min 1 and heating rate 5 c min 1 were used to determine the endothermic peak corresponding to the hydrate water loss patterns with variable gibbsite contents from 0 5 to 50 were used to obtain the calibration line table 2 collects the values of the gibbsite contents for different bpem samples the capacity of alumina to catch water mainly depends on their γ alumina content however some of the samples were stored for long time in ambient atmosphere and for that reason the values of the moisture determined according to the standard method ac 02 are greater than in the case of storing product in suitable conditions values are collected in table 2 the moisture on ignition moi was determined by a test carried out at 550 c for a period of two hours once this temperature was reached sample was removed from the oven to a desiccator and subsequently weighted as samples can reabsorb water they should be cooled for less than half an hour 20 min to avoid weight increases in the cooling period moi values of the bpem are great due to the hydrate content gibbsite results for the moi are collected in table 2 lost on ignition loi was also determined for the bpem to remove the last traces of water in alumina microparticles therefore samples were heated at 900 c for two hours in a muffle determined according to the standard method ac 02 results for the loi are collected in table 2 the alpha alumina content is important as it is related with the adsorption capacity standard samples were prepared to calculate the alpha alumina content in the different bpem using γ alumina with 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 and 50 content the peak area intensity corresponding to d 012 3 479 å was determined by x ray diffraction technique 3 experimental method preliminary tests were carried out aimed at studying the appropriate conditions for the adsorption tests when using bpem from the spanish factory volume of solution quantity of absorbent and concentration of the solution several preliminary tests indicated that the best results were achieved when one liter of solution 100 g of absorbent and 1 g l solution of copper sulphate for the subsequent tests it is observed that initial contact times in the absorbent test exhibited very fast linear kinetics between 5 15 min then a transition zone between 15 and 30 min and finally second linear kinetics between 30 min and 6 h the adsorption capacity is for different adsorbate concentration and solution adsorbent ratio between 2 and 2 5 gram kg 1 of bpem considered as guide values 3 1 adsorption capacity of bpem from different plant extraction curves were obtained for bpems from bayer plants located in australia brazil canada france germany ireland and spain a water solution of 1 g per liter of cu2 sulphate and a weight ratio of 10 solution bpem were used tests were performed at room temperature 20 c and 250 rpm of magnetic stirring adsorption curves are showed in figs 1 and 2 it is observed that most of the copper is extracted in short times 5 min in most of the bpems acceptable results are observed in fig 1 for bpem from canada ireland spain and brazil and in the case of australia france and germany the bpems extract all the copper in the first 5 min as in the case of australia france and germany the bpems extract all the copper in the first 5 min other adsorption curves were made with a solution ten times more concentrated 10 g l cuso4 solution fig 2 this matter was deduced from adsorption studies made for times 5 min these studies have shown a significant adsorption rate in the early stage of the test results are collected in table 3 table 3 collects expressed as a decimal the copper sulphate absorbed by the bpem for different times of contact the bpem is introduced in the solution 1 g per liter of cu2 sulphate then the solution is filtered at different times of contact 5 s 15 s 30 s 1 min etc and the percentage of copper that was extracted is determined it is possible to see in the table 3 that in 15 s the adsorption exceeds 63 in all bpem but two of the by products those from germany and france have reached 93 and 99 respectively as a result of those values it was necessary to elaborate the adsorption curve with a solution of 10 times greater concentration fig 2 10 g of cuso4 5h2o per liter which means 2 54 g cu2 l the behavior of the other bpems adjust to logarithmic curves with quite good correlation only canada reaching the exhaustion of copper in the conditions of the test solution of 270 mg cu l and solution bpem ratio of 10 brazil 2 1 g cu2 kg bpem spain 2 6 g cu2 kg bpem and canada 2 70 g cu2 kg bpem france germany and australia exhaust the copper from the solution in less than 15 s 1 min and 10 min respectively adsorption limits are collected in table 4 for bpems from different plants bpems from spain ireland and canada have similar adsorption rate around 2 5 3 g cu2 kg bpem australian bpem has an adsorption greater than 4 00 g cu2 kg bpem german bpem 9 g cu2 kg bpem french bpem 10 3 g cu2 kg bpem brazilian bpem exhibits the worst results 2 16 gcu2 kg bpem results collected in table 4 are related with the technology used to produce the alumina and also with the quality of the manufactured alumina metallurgical alumina is produced in brazil canada ireland and spain using similar fluidized bed calciners in the case of france and germany metallurgical alumina is produced in rotary calciners in the case of australia both types of technologies are still in use and thus intermediate results are obtained in the case of the australian bpem it contains 72 of aluminum hydrate it is possible that part of this hydrate determined from the thermal analysis was already an activated hydrate with greater absorption capacity than the gibbsite this would explain the good adsorption capacity with only 20 of gamma alumina as with similar percentage of gamma alumina brazilian bpem contains 61 of gibbsite and a worse capacity of adsorption in the case of the french bpem the high adsorption capacity cannot be well explained by its composition because it contains little gamma alumina content 23 7 and great alpha alumina content 42 0 with a gibbsite content of 31 0 however alpha alumina is activated during the calcination of the bpem it is known that alumina for special purposes was produced in this french factory at that time for instance to be used as catalyst support bpem nature would be derived from that of the activated product 3 2 nuclear magnetic resonance nmr analyses nmr technique was used to determine the atoms that are associated with cu2 adsorption on the alumina microparticles bpem this information allows knowing the sites for the metal cation attachment the rotation nmr technique is used to determine the relative populations of hydrogen and aluminum ions for different coordination in the crystal structure of aluminas the equipment used to obtain the nmr spectra was the bruker av600 with shielded 14 0 t magnet topspin 3 0 software was used for the analyses of the nmr spectra 1h and 27al nmr spectra have been determined depending on the composition of the material to be tested the objective using these spectra is to identify the presence of aluminum oxides and hydroxides as well as their crystalline bonding structures for the α alumina γ alumina and hydroxides α alumina γ alumina and hydroxides result from the calcination of gibbsite which appear in the bpem with different levels of calcination we consider that all transition alumina γ alumina consists of oxides and hydroxides under different conditions of dehydroxylation or dehydratation nmr spectra of 1h and 27al for the different bpem before and after cu2 adsorption are collected in fig 3 german bpem fig 4 australian bpem fig 5 brazilian bpem fig 6 canadian bpem fig 7 spanish bpem fig 8 french bpem and fig 9 irish bpem adsorbed water can exist both as water of physisorption and as hydroxyl groups water molecules react at low temperatures to form surface hydroxyl groups at high temperatures adjacent hydroxyl groups may also condense to form water molecules which are subsequently removed by dehydration reactions and create oxide vacancies with 4 or 5 coordinated alox from which have been postulated surface models for the gamma alumina that would include five different hydroxyl surface locations providing a framework for discussing and describing the different aluminum oxygen atoms and protons associated with the surface locations of the al oh generation of superficial vacancies is formulated as follows 19 1 oh oh o vacancy h2o nmr 27al spectrum is studied for all the bpem because it denotes the presence of the γ alumina by the appearance of peaks at 10 and 55 ppm due to the superficial octahedral and tetrahedral al oh positioning this fact reveals that some bpem when temperature exceeds 800 c lose the signals corresponding to the adjacent hydroxyl groups that have been removed the presence of 4 and 6 coordinated al oh can be detected in the nmr spectra depending on the calcination degree they have undergone removal of hydroxyl groups that generate the al o al bonds confers catalytic properties to alumina materials it is possible to pass from an exclusively octahedral alo6 material to alo5 material forming structural alo5 fractions by hydroxyl condensation 20 collection activity of the bpem will have a relation with the residual structure of the bpem calcination in other words depending on degrees of dehydroxilation or dehydration achieved which are in turn function of the temperature range to which the particles were subjected these processes mainly at around 500 c are the ones that produce the activation of the alumina and the generation of the micro mesoporosity 21 in this process the kinetics of water evacuation is fundamental 1h nmr spectrum is also studied since this spectrum denotes the presence of the γ alumina by the appearance of peaks in 1 2 and 4 6 ppm 22 23 the 4 6 ppm peak corresponds to the hydrogen bound water present on the surface of the alumina and the 1 2 ppm peak to the non hydrogen bound physisorbided water this technique has been also used to explain the mechanism of copper fixation by bpem considering the nmr spectra before and after copper adsorption for each bpem no important changes are observed between the spectra before and after copper fixation in the 27al spectrum which indicates that there is no physical chemical phenomenon with aluminum cation exchange although small solutions of al3 in the long time agitation of alumina microparticles with copper salt solutions lead to that there is later co precipitation with copper in the hydroxide form 24 this explains the increase that the 27al signal experiences for the french bpem once the copper has been adsorbed spectra of 1h clearly show the decrease of the peak intensity around 5 ppm 4 6 ppm according to the previous references proportional to the amount of copper adsorbed by the bpem based on the above it can be concluded that a copper fixation mechanism is through the replacement of the hydrogen bonding present on the surface of the hydrated alumina by the copper cations comparing the spectra of bpems from different bayer plants it is possible to check that the french bpem exhibits the greatest difference between the peak heights before and after copper adsorption which agrees with the experimental results where the french bpem had the greatest adsorption capacity on the contrary brazilian bpem has the smallest peak difference before and after copper adsorption the other bpems have intermediate behavior but closer to that of the french bpem 4 conclusions bpem can be used to fix copper from wastewater therefore it is possible to use a waste from the alumina industry to minimize the problem of the heavy metal lixiviation which may cause environmental or health problems bpems from seven bayer plants located in different countries australia brazil canada france germany ireland and spain were used this waste was characterized considering the following parameters humidity m o i l o i real density average particle size and grain size distribution alpha phase content hydrate content specific surface bet test compositional chemical analysis al2o3 na2o and impurities bpem mainly consists of alpha alumina min 6 5 and max 53 aluminum hydrates min 12 and max 72 and intermediate or gamma alumina the adsorption of cu2 by the different bpems was studied using nmr technique a significant attenuation of the 1h spectrum was found in all the aluminas even in the brazilian one even though the initial signal bpem without cu2 was already low the most important peak at 4 6 ppm was assigned to water oh bound by the hydrogen present on the surface of the alumina there does not seem to be any cu2 adsorbed related to 27al although some spectra show a slight attenuation of the corresponding peak thus cu fixation is produced by replacement of hydrogen bonding present on the surface of the hydrated alumina by the cu cations this way results indicate that bayer process electrostatic precipitator microparticles from german and french g cu2 kg bpem factories exhibit the best results regarding the adsorption of copper from water even when the rest are also able to absorb copper from water and it is possible to say that bpem might be used to remove heavy metals from wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

french bpem once the copper has been adsorbed spectra of 1h clearly show the decrease of the peak intensity around 5 ppm 4 6 ppm according to the previous references proportional to the amount of copper adsorbed by the bpem based on the above it can be concluded that a copper fixation mechanism is through the replacement of the hydrogen bonding present on the surface of the hydrated alumina by the copper cations comparing the spectra of bpems from different bayer plants it is possible to check that the french bpem exhibits the greatest difference between the peak heights before and after copper adsorption which agrees with the experimental results where the french bpem had the greatest adsorption capacity on the contrary brazilian bpem has the smallest peak difference before and after copper adsorption the other bpems have intermediate behavior but closer to that of the french bpem 4 conclusions bpem can be used to fix copper from wastewater therefore it is possible to use a waste from the alumina industry to minimize the problem of the heavy metal lixiviation which may cause environmental or health problems bpems from seven bayer plants located in different countries australia brazil canada france germany ireland and spain were used this waste was characterized considering the following parameters humidity m o i l o i real density average particle size and grain size distribution alpha phase content hydrate content specific surface bet test compositional chemical analysis al2o3 na2o and impurities bpem mainly consists of alpha alumina min 6 5 and max 53 aluminum hydrates min 12 and max 72 and intermediate or gamma alumina the adsorption of cu2 by the different bpems was studied using nmr technique a significant attenuation of the 1h spectrum was found in all the aluminas even in the brazilian one even though the initial signal bpem without cu2 was already low the most important peak at 4 6 ppm was assigned to water oh bound by the hydrogen present on the surface of the alumina there does not seem to be any cu2 adsorbed related to 27al although some spectra show a slight attenuation of the corresponding peak thus cu fixation is produced by replacement of hydrogen bonding present on the surface of the hydrated alumina by the cu cations this way results indicate that bayer process electrostatic precipitator microparticles from german and french g cu2 kg bpem factories exhibit the best results regarding the adsorption of copper from water even when the rest are also able to absorb copper from water and it is possible to say that bpem might be used

13687,since low oxygen supplement rate in subsurface flow constructed wetland was a critical obstacle to bacterial nitrification process a novel tidal unsaturated constructed wetland cwtu realized by the siphon effluent pipe was proposed in this study to overcome the problem and strengthen the pollutants removal four cwtus were constructed with different ratios of tidal unsaturated section to constant saturated section 80 0 60 20 50 30 and 30 50 results showed that the nh4 n removal efficiency increased with the increasing ratio of tidal unsaturated section to constant saturated section among which cwtu1 significantly enhanced the oxygen supplement from air to wastewater and the subsequent removal efficiencies of nh4 n 51 04 6 99 in cwtu1 and cod 89 90 2 10 in cwtu1 compared with traditional wetland nh4 n 12 96 5 26 cod 65 30 10 08 p 0 05 increasing the removal rate of nh4 n by approximately 3 times according to the dynamic changes of pollutant distribution in cwtu the carbon source shortage in the constantly saturated section could be the reason for the poor tn removal which could be modified by adding slow released carbon substrate to realize the thorough removal of nitrogen pollutant in cwtus keywords unsaturated area oxygen supplement tidal siphon effluent nitrogen removal pollutant temporal spatial distribution 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws are widely applied for domestic wastewater treatment due to the low energy consumption simple maintenance and landscape benefit among the others 1 2 total nitrogen tn as a typical fraction of wastewater plays a key role in eutrophication the removal efficiency of tn in cws was reported to be 40 50 with the loading rate of 250 and 630 g n m 2yr 1 3 tn is mainly removed by nitrification and denitrification process via different functional microorganisms 4 such as ammonia oxidizing bacteria nitrosomonadaceae etc 5 nitrite oxidizing bacteria nitrospirales nitrospira etc 6 and denitrifying bacteria bacillus thauera etc 5 which account for 80 of tn removal approximately 2 by stoichiometry 4 57 g o2 will be consumed by 1 g ammonia nitrogen in the nitrification process 7 hence the limited oxygen entering cws by surface ventilation plant root release and influent is far insufficient for ammonia oxidation 8 leading to the low tn removal efficiency 9 aeration tidal operation and water drop influent are the main strategies to improve the oxygen supplement in cws currently 10 aeration obtained 50 tn removal and the oxygen concentration fluctuated between 7 mg l and 8 mg l 11 however it has the problem of high energy consumption 12 according to the study of han et al tidal operation contained flooding stage and draining stage and 70 71 of tn can be removed with the surface load of 0 054 kg n m 2d 1 2 water drop influent improves the oxygen supplement by raising the o2 concentration of influent 13 tidal operation and water drop influent could only provide oxygen to either biofilm or wastewater before the bacterial wastewater treatment process in cws which should be further enhanced therefore a novel tidal unsaturated constructed wetland cwtu combining the characters of tidal operation and water drop influent was proposed in this paper which realized the continuous oxygen supplement for nitrification process moreover cwtu also provided partial anaerobic conditions for denitrification process the performance of wastewater purification and the dynamic mechanism were further investigated in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 configuration of cwtu the schematic diagram of cwtu system was shown in fig 1 cwtu was made of transparent polymethyl methacrylate and filled with brown quartz sand diameter ranges from 3 mm to 8 mm corresponding to the porosity of 41 6 0 9 and the effective volume of 9 l the operation procedures were drawn in fig 1 b the effluent of wetland was automatically and periodically discharged by an inverted u shaped siphon pipe 5 mm inner diameter 2 2 experimental condition and operation six wetland systems fig 1c including four tidal unsaturated constructed wetlands cwtus an artificial aeration vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland cwa and a conventional vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland without aeration cwna were built the volume ratios v v of tidal unsaturated zone to constant saturated zone in four cwtus were 80 0 60 20 50 30 and 30 50 which were defined as cwtu1 cwtu2 cwtu3 and cwtu4 respectively pvc multi hole pipes were buried in each wetland to determine the in situ dissolved oxygen do and be applied for water sampling from different depths in cws for further pollutant concentration measurement the biofilm was incubated for two weeks with the aerobic granular sludge from the western wastewater treatment plant in jimo district qingdao city shandong province china then influent water was continuously pumped into the cws with the hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h corresponding to the hydraulic load of 1 62 l m 2d 1 the environmental temperature was around 17 0 3 0 the synthetic wastewater composition is shown in table 1 to simulate the secondary effluent of municipal wastewater 13 14 column experiment was applied to explore the oxygenation performance and its influence on bacterial behavior for water purification in the simulated cw microcosm therefore no plants were added in this study 2 3 sample collection and analytical methods effluent water quality was described in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp the water samples were taken every 3 days in each cw eight sites along the water flow pathway as is shown in fig 1c were selected to study the function of different sections on wastewater purification and describe the spatial and temporal distribution of do the do was determined in situ with calibrated portable dissolved oxygen meter hq30d hach usa through pvc multi hole pipes every three days all the items were determined according to standard operating procedures 15 all tests were carried out in triplicate and a one way analysis of variance anova was conducted by spss 19 ibm inc usa to find out the consistency between different groups significant level was set to be p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 operation principle and advantages of cwtu the operation principle of cwtu fig 1b showed that the continuous influent and the periodical effluent led to a periodical changeable water level the interval between two drainages was defined as one cycle influent entered from the inner side of cwtu flowed down under the gravity and interacted with the biofilm on the surface of substrate which exposed to the gap air in the middle of substrate at the meantime when the water level in the reactor rose slightly above the top of the siphon drain the water started to be discharged rapidly due to the siphon phenomenon when the liquid level dropped to the junction of the siphon effluent pipe and the main reactor the siphon effect would be destroyed and a processing cycle was completed for the conventional vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland the do concentration at a certain site of the substrate was constant owing to the constant water level different from it cwtus had the temporal changing water level and the subsequent changeable do level in different stage owing to the characteristic of cwtus the relationship between the fluctuation of do concentration and the removal of pollutants will be discussed in detail in section 3 3 fig 1 a showed the operation advantages of cwtu when wastewater dropped continuously from the top of cwtu a thin liquid film would be formed on the surface of substrate above the joint of effluent pipe which was also exposed to the air in the middle of substrate pores and enabled the oxygen from air coming into the biofilm on the surface of substrate rapidly without passing through the thick waterbody 10 14 the multi biofilm liquid gas phases greatly enhanced the oxygen supplement for the bacterial nitrification process data indicated that do at site 3 stage 2 shown in fig 2 reached up to 4 58 mg l and nh4 n concentration reduced from 25 mg l to 12 3 mg l after a 60 cm height unsaturated zone treatment do levels in cwna approximately maintained at 0 1 mg l while the highest instantaneous do could reach 4 58 mg l in cwtu1 it demonstrated that tidal unsaturated constructed wetland cwtu was efficient to improve oxygen supplement which was consistent with li s study 16 baffle in cwtu could guide the waterflow passing through the aerobic anaerobic aerobic functional zones sequentially prevent the discharge of the water just entering the system and allow the water near the outlet with a relatively long water retention time to be discharged first the design of siphon effluent formed periodic unsaturated area and long term submerged area in cwtu which formed the relatively oxic and anaerobic condition and benefited for the oxygen supplement and denitrification respectively 13 14 3 2 performance of pollutants removal in cws the influent water loads and pollutant removal efficiencies of cws are listed in table 2 the removal efficiencies of cod and nh4 n in cwa and experimental groups cwtu1 4 were significantly higher than those in cwna p 0 05 previous studies demonstrated that cod were mainly decomposed by aerobic microbial degradation and ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob needed adequate do to drive nh4 n removal 16 17 the oxygen condition had a positive correlation to the removal effects of cod and nh4 n data in table 2 proved that cwtus had superior oxygen transfer performance which was conducive to cod and nh4 n removal the removal efficiencies of tn in cwa and cwna were lower than that in experimental groups except cwtu1 p 0 05 seen from the nitrogen sources distribution in the effluents of cwa and cwna table 2 denitrification and nitrification process were insufficient for cwa and cwna respectively because cwa and cwna can only provide a single aerobic or anaerobic environment respectively in this view the absence of alternative oxygen condition may be a key influencing factor for the low nitrogen removal which was also supported by other studies 13 14 zheng et al 13 established a simulating constructed wetland scw with baffles and constant unsaturated zones indicating that the do concentration was as high as 5 03 mg l in the unsaturated zone and dropped sharply to 0 05 mg l in saturated area the partially unsaturated scw offered diverse do levels which was conducive to tn removal as for cwtu the biofilm on the surface of the substrate exposed to the air and could effectively bring a series of aerobic reactions aerobic respiration ammonia oxidation and nitrification etc when wastewater passed through the existence of unsaturated zone supplied multi biofilm liquid gas phases circumstances successfully reduced the concentration of cod and nh4 n to 16 88 mg l and 13 82 mg l at site 4 stage 1 shown in fig 2 respectively corresponding to the transformation ratio of 83 12 and 55 28 respectively the unsaturated zone in cwtu showed strong oxygenation ability with the baffle set alternative aerobic anaerobic conditions of the bottom substrate created by the changing water level benefited for the nitrification denitrification process which realized the better tn removal in cwtus however the removal efficiencies of tn in all cwtus were not higher than 30 high efficiency removal of cod in aerobic unsaturated section led to the shortage of organic carbon sources for the subsequent denitrification in the following saturated section 18 that may explain the relatively low tn removal in cwtus zhi and ji 19 revealed that the best c n ratio in tidal flow constructed wetland was 12 in our study the overall c n ratio in cwtu1 was just 0 88 which was considerably lower than the optimal c n ratio this problem was also recognizes by the pollutant distribution analysis in section 3 3 adding slow release carbon source such as poly butylenes succinate pbs or biochar into cwtu could be a promising strategy to solve the problem 10 the substrate absorbance was reported to be a main pathway for tp removal 20 as the substrate applied in all the cws were the same in this study the contribution of substrate adsorption could be considered equally at the same time alternative aerobic anaerobic condition benefited for the absorption of phosphorus by polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos 20 which made cwtus acquire the better phosphorus removal efficiency than cwna and cwa p 0 05 the pollutant loads and pollutant removal efficiencies of cws are described in table 2 in cwtu1 4 there were not significant differences in cod and tp removal p 0 05 moreover the higher unsaturated area ratio led to the better nh4 n removal the nh4 n removal efficiency of cwtu1 was significantly p 0 05 higher than that of cwtu4 and tn removal was significantly p 0 05 lower than that of cwtu4 which proved that the increase of saturated area promoted the denitrification process and inhibited the removal of nh4 n though cwtu1 possessed the longest unsaturated area and the best oxygen supplement performance all the water in cwtu1 will be drained off once siphon formed including the raw water with little residence time which counteracted the advantage of sufficient oxygenation for the part of water that entering the system in the early time differently water in cwtu4 flew through a relatively short unsaturated area but all the drained water was near the outlet as site 7 and 8 in fig 2 therefore no significant differences in cod removal were found in four cwtus this also explained the similar removal efficiency of tp however the discharge of untreated nh4 n in the raw water with a short residence time could not counteract the high efficiency oxidation of nh4 n in the former entered water in cwtu1 3 3 the dynamic of pollutants removal in cwtus for the continuous flow cws the physics chemical condition at one site in cws was constant cwtu achieved continuous inlet and tidal effluent making the water level change periodically hence the micro environment in cwtu varied temporally and spatially nitrification needs oxic condition while denitrification needs anaerobic condition and organic carbon sources 10 regarding this physics chemical condition in cwtu was critical for pollutant transformation pathways 3 21 hence the dynamic of do and pollutant distribution were summarized in fig 2 to analyze the pollutant removal mechanism one period between two times of discharge was artificially divided into four stages according to the water level changes i e just after discharge 1 3 of the highest water level 2 3 of the highest water level and about to discharge as shown in fig 2 according to fig 1c 8 sites were chosen to monitor the temporal and spatial changes of water quality and do level in cwtu1 stage 1 was in the state that drainage just completed due to the siphon mechanism therefore the wastewater entered at stage 1 could come across a relatively large area of unsaturated substrate while the wastewater entered during stage 3 could just meet a small area of unsaturated substrate once wastewater left the unsaturated area and entered the saturated area the high efficiency oxygen supplement process through multi biofilm liquid gas phases could be stopped hence the do near the surface in inner cwtu showed a decreasing trend along with time course owing to the growing short air contact time reductive pollutants e g ammonia and cod could consume do continuously thus do at site 3 stage 2 decreased from 4 58 mg l to 1 1 mg l when this part of water moved to site 4 stage 3 under the comprehensive functions of oxygen supplement by air dissolution and bacterial consumption the temporal and spatial do distribution was formed and shown in fig 2 as a result of a plug flow mode formed by baffle design water entered earliest would stay at site 8 and water entered latest would stay at site 1 during stage 4 moreover water at site 8 has gone through a longer distance of unsaturated zone compared with site 1 it showed that ammonia concentration at site 8 stage 4 decreased to 6 5 mg l while it remained at as high as 23 25 mg l at site 1 stage 4 cod concentration at site 8 stage 4 decreased to 10 60 mg l while it remained as high as 28 65 mg l at site 1 stage 4 hence the decreasing trend of cod and ammonia from site 1 to site 8 demonstrated that pollutant oxidation efficiency had a positive correlation to the contact time between wastewater and unsaturated substrate which was in line with the study of saeed et al 17 they found that the effluent concentration of ammonia nitrogen gradually decreased from 23 7 7 1 mg l to 15 7 6 2 mg l as the volume of the unsaturated zone increased from 70 to 100 17 however the nitrate showed the opposite trend with ammonia and cod according to the study of hu et al complete tn elimination relied first on complete nitrification 18 sufficient oxygen supplement promoted nitrification but limited denitrification due to the lack of anoxic zone and carbon source which restricted effective tn removal 10 16 18 tn distribution at stage 4 was unnormal for tn at site 5 stage 4 which achieved the best tn removal efficiency water entered cwtu at different time could come across different ratios of aerobic anaerobic conditions water at site 5 stage 4 entered this system when water level reached one half of the system which may have the optimal ratio of unsaturated to saturated conditions for nitrification and denitrification process above all the water quality at outer ring of cwtu was better than that inside just as depicted in the cod and nh4 n concentration variation of fig 2 for the ammonia removal the water entered at beginning went through the whole area of unsaturated substrate which showed a high removal rate of 74 while ammonia nitrogen decreased by 18 53 mg l and nitrate nitrogen increased by 16 42 mg l simultaneously however once siphon started all the water in cwtu1 would discharge including the part of relatively raw water at inner side which led to 51 24 average removal rate of ammonia hence siphon tube was also connected with joints 2 7 in cwtu2 4 in fig 1 a to accomplish the partial discharge of the water with relatively long retention time there is a trade off between high level oxygen supplement and the discharge of raw wastewater the optimal condition should be adjusted according to the inlet water quality and other factors 4 conclusions cwtu significantly increased the removal efficiencies of nh4 n cod and tp compared with cwna p 0 05 there was a positive correlation between unsaturated area and nh4 n removal efficiency the performance of pollutant removal could be explained by the dynamic water quality distribution in cwtus which could also guide the construction optimization of cwtus for different kinds of wastewater the shortage of carbon source for denitrification was diagnosed to be the reason for low tn removal efficiency which could be solved by adding a slow release carbon source in cwtus declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of

13687,since low oxygen supplement rate in subsurface flow constructed wetland was a critical obstacle to bacterial nitrification process a novel tidal unsaturated constructed wetland cwtu realized by the siphon effluent pipe was proposed in this study to overcome the problem and strengthen the pollutants removal four cwtus were constructed with different ratios of tidal unsaturated section to constant saturated section 80 0 60 20 50 30 and 30 50 results showed that the nh4 n removal efficiency increased with the increasing ratio of tidal unsaturated section to constant saturated section among which cwtu1 significantly enhanced the oxygen supplement from air to wastewater and the subsequent removal efficiencies of nh4 n 51 04 6 99 in cwtu1 and cod 89 90 2 10 in cwtu1 compared with traditional wetland nh4 n 12 96 5 26 cod 65 30 10 08 p 0 05 increasing the removal rate of nh4 n by approximately 3 times according to the dynamic changes of pollutant distribution in cwtu the carbon source shortage in the constantly saturated section could be the reason for the poor tn removal which could be modified by adding slow released carbon substrate to realize the thorough removal of nitrogen pollutant in cwtus keywords unsaturated area oxygen supplement tidal siphon effluent nitrogen removal pollutant temporal spatial distribution 1 introduction constructed wetlands cws are widely applied for domestic wastewater treatment due to the low energy consumption simple maintenance and landscape benefit among the others 1 2 total nitrogen tn as a typical fraction of wastewater plays a key role in eutrophication the removal efficiency of tn in cws was reported to be 40 50 with the loading rate of 250 and 630 g n m 2yr 1 3 tn is mainly removed by nitrification and denitrification process via different functional microorganisms 4 such as ammonia oxidizing bacteria nitrosomonadaceae etc 5 nitrite oxidizing bacteria nitrospirales nitrospira etc 6 and denitrifying bacteria bacillus thauera etc 5 which account for 80 of tn removal approximately 2 by stoichiometry 4 57 g o2 will be consumed by 1 g ammonia nitrogen in the nitrification process 7 hence the limited oxygen entering cws by surface ventilation plant root release and influent is far insufficient for ammonia oxidation 8 leading to the low tn removal efficiency 9 aeration tidal operation and water drop influent are the main strategies to improve the oxygen supplement in cws currently 10 aeration obtained 50 tn removal and the oxygen concentration fluctuated between 7 mg l and 8 mg l 11 however it has the problem of high energy consumption 12 according to the study of han et al tidal operation contained flooding stage and draining stage and 70 71 of tn can be removed with the surface load of 0 054 kg n m 2d 1 2 water drop influent improves the oxygen supplement by raising the o2 concentration of influent 13 tidal operation and water drop influent could only provide oxygen to either biofilm or wastewater before the bacterial wastewater treatment process in cws which should be further enhanced therefore a novel tidal unsaturated constructed wetland cwtu combining the characters of tidal operation and water drop influent was proposed in this paper which realized the continuous oxygen supplement for nitrification process moreover cwtu also provided partial anaerobic conditions for denitrification process the performance of wastewater purification and the dynamic mechanism were further investigated in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 configuration of cwtu the schematic diagram of cwtu system was shown in fig 1 cwtu was made of transparent polymethyl methacrylate and filled with brown quartz sand diameter ranges from 3 mm to 8 mm corresponding to the porosity of 41 6 0 9 and the effective volume of 9 l the operation procedures were drawn in fig 1 b the effluent of wetland was automatically and periodically discharged by an inverted u shaped siphon pipe 5 mm inner diameter 2 2 experimental condition and operation six wetland systems fig 1c including four tidal unsaturated constructed wetlands cwtus an artificial aeration vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland cwa and a conventional vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland without aeration cwna were built the volume ratios v v of tidal unsaturated zone to constant saturated zone in four cwtus were 80 0 60 20 50 30 and 30 50 which were defined as cwtu1 cwtu2 cwtu3 and cwtu4 respectively pvc multi hole pipes were buried in each wetland to determine the in situ dissolved oxygen do and be applied for water sampling from different depths in cws for further pollutant concentration measurement the biofilm was incubated for two weeks with the aerobic granular sludge from the western wastewater treatment plant in jimo district qingdao city shandong province china then influent water was continuously pumped into the cws with the hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h corresponding to the hydraulic load of 1 62 l m 2d 1 the environmental temperature was around 17 0 3 0 the synthetic wastewater composition is shown in table 1 to simulate the secondary effluent of municipal wastewater 13 14 column experiment was applied to explore the oxygenation performance and its influence on bacterial behavior for water purification in the simulated cw microcosm therefore no plants were added in this study 2 3 sample collection and analytical methods effluent water quality was described in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp the water samples were taken every 3 days in each cw eight sites along the water flow pathway as is shown in fig 1c were selected to study the function of different sections on wastewater purification and describe the spatial and temporal distribution of do the do was determined in situ with calibrated portable dissolved oxygen meter hq30d hach usa through pvc multi hole pipes every three days all the items were determined according to standard operating procedures 15 all tests were carried out in triplicate and a one way analysis of variance anova was conducted by spss 19 ibm inc usa to find out the consistency between different groups significant level was set to be p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 operation principle and advantages of cwtu the operation principle of cwtu fig 1b showed that the continuous influent and the periodical effluent led to a periodical changeable water level the interval between two drainages was defined as one cycle influent entered from the inner side of cwtu flowed down under the gravity and interacted with the biofilm on the surface of substrate which exposed to the gap air in the middle of substrate at the meantime when the water level in the reactor rose slightly above the top of the siphon drain the water started to be discharged rapidly due to the siphon phenomenon when the liquid level dropped to the junction of the siphon effluent pipe and the main reactor the siphon effect would be destroyed and a processing cycle was completed for the conventional vertical subsurface flow constructed wetland the do concentration at a certain site of the substrate was constant owing to the constant water level different from it cwtus had the temporal changing water level and the subsequent changeable do level in different stage owing to the characteristic of cwtus the relationship between the fluctuation of do concentration and the removal of pollutants will be discussed in detail in section 3 3 fig 1 a showed the operation advantages of cwtu when wastewater dropped continuously from the top of cwtu a thin liquid film would be formed on the surface of substrate above the joint of effluent pipe which was also exposed to the air in the middle of substrate pores and enabled the oxygen from air coming into the biofilm on the surface of substrate rapidly without passing through the thick waterbody 10 14 the multi biofilm liquid gas phases greatly enhanced the oxygen supplement for the bacterial nitrification process data indicated that do at site 3 stage 2 shown in fig 2 reached up to 4 58 mg l and nh4 n concentration reduced from 25 mg l to 12 3 mg l after a 60 cm height unsaturated zone treatment do levels in cwna approximately maintained at 0 1 mg l while the highest instantaneous do could reach 4 58 mg l in cwtu1 it demonstrated that tidal unsaturated constructed wetland cwtu was efficient to improve oxygen supplement which was consistent with li s study 16 baffle in cwtu could guide the waterflow passing through the aerobic anaerobic aerobic functional zones sequentially prevent the discharge of the water just entering the system and allow the water near the outlet with a relatively long water retention time to be discharged first the design of siphon effluent formed periodic unsaturated area and long term submerged area in cwtu which formed the relatively oxic and anaerobic condition and benefited for the oxygen supplement and denitrification respectively 13 14 3 2 performance of pollutants removal in cws the influent water loads and

1 introduction to overcome water shortage which is becoming a growing worldwide challenge domestic wastewater dww must be considered as a promising water resource instead of mere waste indeed wastewater can be reused for different applications among which agricultural industrial and municipal uses but also for ground water recharge 1 even though occurrence of organic micropollutants omps in municipal wastewater constitutes an important limiting factor pointed out by many authors 2 4 according to ganiyu et al most of the pharmaceuticals administered for both human and animal uses are excreted unmodified via urine and feces and directly introduced into sewage systems 5 an important factor limiting the wastewater reuse is the inefficiency of conventional waste water treatment plant wwtp in removing omps 6 even in the case of secondary treatment processes improved by mbr omps are not fully removed and some specific compounds showed really low removal efficiencies between 8 and 32 for pesticides such as atrazine and fenoprop 7 consequently pharmaceuticals and antibiotics have been found widespread in different environmental compartments due to their persistence and low biodegradability 8 to fulfill public regulations requirements and achieve sustainable development goals in terms of ensuring safe and sustainable access to water sdg 6 un 9 tertiary treatment processes capable of removing bio resistant compounds are being developed and investigated activated carbon adsorption ozonation and membrane separation processes such as nf and ro have been investigated in wastewater treatment schemes tight nanofiltration and reverse osmosis remove well the majority of organic micropollutants above 95 the efficiency of such membrane processes depends mainly on the type of membrane the effluent matrix and the micropollutants physico chemical properties 10 12 these last years some authors have demonstrated that nanofiltration nf could be a good alternative to reverse osmosis ro for urban wastewater reuse 13 15 indeed it offers a very good compromise between permeability and selectivity due to the more important permeate flux compared to ro while having an acceptable omps removal nanofiltration requires less energy and seems more appropriate in an economical point of view for the treatment of such refractory effluents 16 17 however there is still the problem of the brine management and the propensity to fouling which both represent an object for many researchers mobilization 18 19 lan et al have investigated the performances of nf on mbr effluent and pointed out that colloidal organic fouling played a major role in flux decline 20 moreover according to mänttäri et al 21 the humic like substances adsorb onto the polyamide based thin film composite and cellulose acetate nf membrane surface forming a gel layer which induces an additional resistance to the flux passage 21 23 fersi et al distinguished two stages in fouling related to gel layer in filtration process the gel layer formation and the gel layer compression 24 because of a decrease in porosity the second stage accelerates the flux decline and this phenomenon was observed after 60 of recovery rate beside the membrane processes advanced oxidation processes are also investigated for omps elimination 25 they offer the advantages in degrading well micropollutants 26 ozone is the second most powerful oxidizing agent after hydroxyl radicals and is much more stable than hydroxyl radicals ozonation was firstly used as final treatment process for effluent disinfection and to oxidize iron and manganese in the end of 19th century 27 nowadays ozonation is subject to many investigation as promising treatment process to eliminate emerging omps 15 26 28 however oxidation sometimes leads to more toxic byproducts than parent compounds and an additional treatment must be added to remove this new toxicity from the final effluent 29 31 the aim of this study was to combine pre ozonation and nf processes to eliminate selected omps in real mbr secondary effluent combining ozonation with nf seems an appropriate synergetic solution to take advantages of these processes while limiting their drawbacks 32 34 indeed while nf membrane act as an efficient physical barrier against toxicity due to omps and their by products pre ozonation can efficiently degrades these refractory pollutants and also maintain the good flux performances of the nf process by limiting membrane fouling the specific objectives were to investigate the fouling propensity and omps removal mechanisms in nf to study the effect of the matrix composition on ozonation process and to evaluate the effect of pre ozonation on fouling and flux evolution in nf 2

matrix ultrapure water was spiked with 1000 μgl 1 of each targeted micropollutants before running any experiment with the real mbr effluent this matrix was used first and served as comparison baseline 2 1 3 real effluent the real effluent was taken from a full scale domestic wwtp equipped with mbr located close to montpellier france the plant was designed to treat 13 000 m3 d of domestic wastewater and was performing biological nitrogen removal nitrification denitrification mbr was equipped with kubota submerged membrane unit smu rw400 kubota japan flat sheet microporous membranes made of chlorinated polyethylene total surface of 16 240 m² with an average pore size of 0 2 μm the characteristics of the mbr permeate are presented in table 2 the effluent was immediately stored at nearly 4 c after sampling in order to limit the variation of the composition and rewarm at room temperature 20 c 1 c before conducting the experiments no significant change was observed in the sample characteristics after the storage period 2 2 membranes selection and nanofiltration protocol 2 2 1 membranes selection and characterization the nf 90 polyamide membrane from dow filmtec has been selected for this study this membrane is considered as a tight nf membrane with an estimated mwco around 150 da which seems appropriate for the retention of the selected micropollutant before experimentation each membrane has been firstly soaked in ultrapure water to remove preservative agent then compacted at 18 bars for one hour at least or still stability of the flux was reached thereafter these membranes have been fully characterized in terms of permeability and sodium chloride retention the nf 90 membrane permeability was determined at 10 bars at 8 4 1 0 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 with a nacl rejection close to 88 4 after experiments membranes were stored in a 200 mg l 1 na2so3 solution at 4 c 2 2 2 cross flow nanofiltration unit and experimental protocol an osmonics sepa cf ii cell sterlitech corp was used to carry out the filtration experiments using flat sheet membrane coupons with an effective membrane area of 140 cm² a pump hydra cell wanner engineering inc was used to feed the sepa cell with the solution from a 16 l feed vessel fig 1 a cryothermostat f32 julabo maintained constant the feed water temperature 20 1 c to prevent an increase in liquid flow temperature during this study the transmembrane pressure tmp was regulated using a micrometric pressure control valve located on the retentate outlet experiments were performed at a cross flow velocity vt of 0 5 m s 1 with a spacer in feed channel of 47 mil 1 194 mm the bench scale nf system was operated at a constant tmp of 10 bars all along the filtration experiment until reaching 80 of water recovery or at least the maximum water recovery reachable the effect of the pressure on the nf membrane efficiency has been examined at different water recovery rates corresponding to 0 15 40 and 60 at 6 8 and 10 bar pressure it has to be noted that in order to evaluate the effect of the pressure at a fixed water recovery the concentrate and permeate was both recirculated into the feed tank finally after each filtration experiment the nf unit was cleaned by first recirculating caustic soda naoh 2 solution then acid hno3 2 solution after each base and acid cleaning the system is fully rinsed with deionized water until a conductivity of 50 μs cm 1 and a neutral ph were reached before the experiment the feed water was placed in the storage tank and recirculated for 24 h vt 0 5 m s 1 without tmp to ensure that compound adsorption onto pipes and membrane had reached a steady state the flux was recording all along the experiment by measuring the permeate weight every 30 s using a scale connected to a computer samples were collected from each compartment feed concentrated and permeate for analysis the volume of the collected sample for different analysis was considered in the mass balance and the apparent rejection calculation considering that the nf system is made of stainless steel material it was assumed that compound micropollutant or organic matter adsorption is exclusively occurring on membrane material 2 2 3 fouling characterization membrane fouling was estimated considering the flux recovery after different type of washing procedure reversible fouling was evaluated first immediately after experiments by conducting ultrapure water cleaning then the irreversible organic fouling was evaluated by the determination of flux recovery after 6 h of sodium hydroxide 0 1 n cleaning finally the inorganic fouling scaling was determined after 6 h recirculation of hydrochloride acid 0 1 n cleaning solution the flux recovery is given by the following equation 1 flu x r e cov

after the experiment and before the cleaning lmh 2 3 ozone pilot semi batch ozonation protocol the ozonation lab scale pilot consists of a glass stirred batch reactor vreactor 3 l under thermostatic control 20 c continuously feed by an ozone generator bmt 803 n from a lab grade pure oxygen tank fig 2 before diffusion in the reactor the ozone is diluted with the oxygen to achieve a gas flow of 60 l h 1 and introduced from the bottom of the reactor through a porous diffuser an ozone gas analyzer bmt 964 is used to monitor the gas ozone concentration o3 gas in after dehumidification the effect of pre ozonation on nf process is studied for two different reaction contact times 15 and 30 min for which indigo method 39 was used to determine the dissolved ozone concentration two electro valves connected to a computer are used to determine the desired concentration for the mix oxygen ozone during the reaction an agitator is used to homogenized 400 rpm and increase the ozone dissolution rate in the solution a recirculating pump is used for sampling the experiment consists in applying an ozone gas concentration and to determine the transferred ozone doze finally the specific ozone doze was defined on a well characterized effluent different contact times were tested depending on the parameter the experiment aimed to monitor 0 min to 5 h 2 4 evaluation of the nanofiltration nf and ozonation systems performance 2 4 1 micropollutant analysis by direct lc ms ms liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms were used to quantify omps and was performed with a waters 2695

quantification limit iql and the instrument detection limit idl were determined according to a detection limit method based on a signal to noise of 3 and 10 for five replicates the iql and idl obtained in ultrapure water are presented in table 3 2 4 2 global indicator for pollution monitoring toc uv254 and suva analysis the specific uv absorbance suva254 corresponds to the ratio of uv254

3 nf removal rate determination the nf removal rate of any parameter is determined by the difference between the feed and permeate concentrations it is then divided by feed concentration and expressed in percentage 2 r c feed c p c feed with r removal rate cfeed concentration in feed stream cp concentration in permeate stream 2 4 4 dissolved organic matter dom characterization using 3deem fluorescence a perkin elmer ls 55 spectrometer usa was used to produce 3deem spectra measurements set up and data analysis were described in details in jacquin et al 41 samples were scanned in ranges of 200 500 nm and 280 600 nm in excitation ex and emission em respectively at the speed of 1500 nm min and the increment at 10 nm while slit width was fixed at 10 nm in excitation and emission the 3deem spectra were divided into five fractions region i ii corresponded to aromatic protein like fluorophores tyrosine ranging from ex 200 250 nm em m 280 380 nm region iii was associated tfulvic acid

nf system the performances of the nf system has been evaluated on both synthetic and real effluents taking into account the permeate flux and omps retention the experimentations have been conducted during 15 25 hours in order to reach at least 80 of water recovery y 80 removal rates of toc and ions in real mbr effluent by nf90 have been presented in a previous study azais et al 2014 depending of the stage of fouling by real mbr effluent with virgin membrane or with fouled membranes nf 90 membranes are able to reject between 92 and 98 of toc between 83 and 97 of monovalent ions cl na k and no3 and between 93 and 100 of divalent ions so4 2 mg2 ca2 3 1 1 flux evolution as a reference baseline an experiment was conducted on ultrapure water spiked with 1000 μg l of each selected omps thereafter same experiment was conducted with a new membrane coupon on real mbr effluent also spiked with omps in order to evaluate the impact of such matrix on water flux decline the results of these experiments are presented in fig 3 with the relative flux ratio between the actual flux and the initial flux on the y axis according to the recovery rates on the x axis the flux decline evolution associated to the filtration of the synthetic solution the reference baseline displays only a slight decrease in the flux 24 after 17 h corresponding of 85 water recovery this might be explained by steric hindrance of higher mw omps and adsorption of the most hydrophobic omps which reduce slightly the flux concerning the real mbr effluent filtration the flux decrease is much more pronounced up to 68 reduction of the initial flux after 25 h experiment corresponding to 80 of water recovery the major factor leading to the flux drop could come from dissolved and colloidal organic matter dcom fouling associated to high molecular weight compounds such as protein like fulvic and humic like substances such substances have been identified as revealed by the 3deem fluorescence spectrometry fig 7 in addition to the colloidal fouling the real mbr effluent contains non negligible salts concentration see table 2 considering that tight nf membrane such as nf 90 has relatively high salt rejection it induces inevitably a difference of salt concentration on both side of the membrane resulting in a decrease of the driving force due to osmotic pressure difference salt concentration increase in the feed compartment with the water recovery resulting in an increasing osmotic pressure 3 1 2 monitoring of removal performances during nf omps removal mechanisms during the previous experiment samples were taken from nf feed and permeate streams to monitor the influence of recovery rate on selected micropollutants removal moreover to assess the impact of the tmp on micropollutants removal samples were also picked for each recovery rate at different pressures 6 8 and 10 bars removal rates at 0 1 and 80 recovery rates are shown in fig 4 removal rate of micropollutants is related to its molecular weight the bigger it is the better the removal is except for act for which the molecular weight 151 da is on the limit of the mwco of the membrane estimated to 150 200 da a very good removal rate has been observed for all the other selected micropollutants so the main removal mechanism seems to be steric hindrance as it was also observed by other authors 11 these authors noticed an impact of real effluent matrix on the retention of uncharged micropollutants in our study additionally to the size exclusion an adsorption competition test using calcium revealed that the tetracyclin was also adsorbed on the effluent organic matter and that adsorption on organic matter may improve its retention for the most hydrophobic compounds carbamazepin and terbutryn interactions with fouled membrane surface might contribute to their removal 5 sulfamethoxazol is charged negatively and might undergo in electrostatic repulsive interactions with the membrane surface thus electrostatic repulsion could contribute to enhance its removal as shown on fig 4 omps removal rate is also linked to the fouling state of the membrane omps removal is lower at 0 1 water recovery where the membrane was unfouled than for the fouled membrane at 80 water recovery as already observed by other authors fouling layer constitutes a second barrier to improve the nf membrane removal ability 20 22 23 3 2 ozonation of mbr real effluent the ozone based degradation of dissolved organic matter dom and selected micropollutants was investigated and in this aim the instantaneous ozone demand iod constitutes a key parameter which was first determined 3 2 1 instantaneous ozone demand determination in order to optimize the specific ozone dose to apply the iod and consumption coefficient k were firstly determined the iod corresponds to the transferred ozone dose tod that is instantaneously consumed by the organic matter of the effluent with k mn 1 the consumption kinetics before any remaining ozone is detected in the outlet liquid phase the two parameters were determined according to roustan et al method and their values are 3 76 mgo3 mgdoc fig 5 corresponding to a specific ozone doze of 0 56 mgo3 mgc and 0 064 mn 1 respectively 44 3 2 2 ozonation of real wastewater the ozonation of the real wastewater were monitored through following parameters uv254 cod and toc in order to better understand the phenomenon the experiments were run for 5 h fig 6 shows the evolution of sub mentioned parameters as a function of both time and ratio tod toc it can be seen in fig 6 that the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm drastically decreases since the beginning of the reaction to stabilize after 30 min 2 1 mgo3 mgc indeed by attacking the double bound of the carbon chain monitored throughout the uv absorbance at 254 nm the ozonation process is known to be efficient in aromaticity degradation 15 45 moreover the cod decreases for 40 from its initial value of 32 mgo2 l in the first 15 min 20 min 1 2 1 5 mgo3 mgc to stabilize around 50 as revealed by previous studies 32 46 the curve of toc degradation over time confirms the inefficiency of ozone in terms of organic matter mineralization with only a very slight decrease even after five hours of ozonation 32 the low change in toc is not detrimental because ozonation main goal is to limit the fouling of nf by transforming dcom into lower mw compounds the second goal of ozone at this stage is to transform bio refractory molecules into more biodegradable compounds that should be further biodegraded after recirculation of nf concentrate to the mbr furthermore the evolution of organic matter was characterized through three dimensional emission excitation fluorescence 3deem 3deem spectra and the percentage of fractions are illustrated in fig 7 3deem spectrum presented in fig 7 a demonstrate that mbr permeate is mainly constituted of fluorescent molecules located in the protein like and smp like regions zones ii and iii as well as in the fulvic like and humic like substances regions zones iv and v fig 7c shows that dom repartition in fractions does not change significantly during 30 min ozonation time 2 1 mgo3 mgc however an important decrease of the overall volume of fluorescence was observed after only 5 min ozonation contact time with almost 70 drop then a slight linearly decrease over time to reach almost 90 drop after 30 min of ozonation fig 7 b the differences between fig 7a and b is due to the first 5 min of reaction 0 5 mgo3 mgc these results are concordant with the observation of liu et al who monitored the evolution of dcom during ozonation and noticed a significant decrease in the intensities of all dcom fluorophores after 30 min ozonation contact time 2 1 mgo3 mgc 47 3 2 3 ozonation of micropollutants in real wastewater during the ozonation of real mbr effluent before coupling with nf the degradation rate of five selected micropollutants has been monitored for 30 min and the results are presented in fig 8 the monitoring of the degradation of the selected micropollutants revealed three categories of micropollutants the first group constituted by act and tet which shows 90 degradation rate in the first 5 min 0 5 mgo3 mgc and total degradation after 10 min 0 9 mgo3 mgc of ozonation reaction time this has been confirmed by some authors who have determined the ozone reactivity kinetics constants ko3 for these molecules 48 50 for act najjar et al obtained 2 6 106 m 1 s 1 in pure water and for tet khan et al evaluated the ozone reactivity kinetics constant at 1 9 106 m 1 s 1 50 51 the second group composed of cbz and sul shows 70 degradation in the first 10 min and almost total degradation after 15 min 1 2 mgo3 mgc to 20 min 1 5 mgo3 mgc of ozonation reaction time the ozone reactivity kinetics coefficients have been determined in literature for this second group as well 3 0 105 m 1 s 1 and 2 5 106 m 1 s 1 were obtained for cbz and sul respectively 49 finally the third category including ter is the less reactive compound to ozone 70 of the initial concentration is degraded by ozone after 20 min and only a degradation of 90 95 of the initial concentration is achieved after 25 min 30 min 2 1 mgo3 mgc reaction time terbutryn is part of a class of micropollutants triazins known to be more resistant to ozone degradation the low reactivity towards ozone of the compound may be explained by stability of triazinic rings 52 3 3 impact of pre ozonation on nf performances in order to investigate the impact of the pre ozonation on the nanofiltration performances some experiments were conducted immediately after mbr effluent ozonation the performances were compared to that of non ozonated matrix as the micropollutants were almost totally degraded during ozonation their removal was not monitored in ozonated matrix except for the terbutryn which is still present at significant concentration 30 μg l but totally eliminated at 80 of water recovery so the impact of pre ozonation on nf is limited to the flux and the fouling study 3 3 1 impact of pre ozonation on nf flux evolution in this section the impact of ozonation on nanofiltration efficiency permeability has been studied the flux evolution for both reference and real mbr effluent ozonated and non ozonated are presented in fig 9 fig 9 reveals that due to the degradation of dom see 3deem on fig 7 during the pre ozonation the flux decline is always lower in case of ozonated matrix than that of non ozonated matrix when the real effluent matrix has been ozonated for 15 min the flux is slightly improved and the decrease in the initial flux is about 65 y 80 indeed nearly 3 and 8 of flux improvement average can be observed after 15 min and 30 min ozonation respectively these flux improvement on real ozonated effluent can be attributed to the oxidation of the protein like fulvic and humic like substances as revealed by the 3deem fluorescence spectrometry fig 7 ozonation induced a structural change in dom by decomposing carbon carbon double bonds and aromatic rings of humic substances 45 53 concerning upw no significant change of flux is observed with pre ozonation which is logical due to the absence of dom it has to be noted that the evolution of the flux in case of upw spiked or not indicate that the presence of micropollutants induced a drop flux of about 20 for y 80 3 4 fouling and resistance of the nf membrane in order to better investigate the impact of the pre ozonation the resistance to the flux for both reference and real mbr effluent ozonated and non ozonated are recapitulated in table 4 table 4 revealed that the ozonation induced for both matrixes a decrease in the overall resistance the reduction of the resistance mainly comes from fouling which was structurally modified by the ozonation as shown in fig 10 a moreover according to the type of washing and subsequent flux recovered the percentages of reversible and irreversible fouling for reference and real mbr effluent matrixes spiked with micropollutants ozonated and non ozonated were also determined and presented in fig 10 b fig 10 a revealed that the pre ozonation induced a decrease of about 40 of the fouling resistance for both matrixes for instance from a fouling resistance of 1014 m 1 after ozonation of real mbr effluent the fouling resistance is only about 6 0 1013 m 1 the fouling characterization confirmed that the pre ozonation enable a mitigation of the fouling propensity during nf especially in the case of real mbr effluent by modifying the dcom structure which led to a dcom more hydrophilic and with less propensity to promote irreversible fouling 33 54 in fact while for the non ozonated mbr effluent only 36 of the initial flux was recovered up to 53 of the initial flux were recovered by a mere ultrapure water cleaning for membrane fouled by ozonated real mbr effluent fig 10 b the opposite effect was observed in the case of upw because the fouling mainly came from omps after ozonation the omps were degraded except the terbutryn which might induce a slightly higher irreversible fouling 4 conclusion the overall objective of the paper was to investigate the impact of a pre ozonation on nf process performances during tertiary treatment of a mbr secondary effluent fouling and micropollutants removal mechanisms during nanofiltration experiments with real mbr effluent have been investigated degradation of a mixture of five micropollutants and dom during ozonation were also studied fouling investigation revealed that size exclusion was the main mechanism of micropollutants rejection in addition gel layer onto fouled membrane formed a supplementary barrier which contributed to enhance micropollutants retention the micropollutants were globally well retained by nf 90 membrane during ozonation relatively high degardation rates were achieved for micropollutants requiring different specific ozone doses in fact while cbz and sul require a specific ozone doze of 1 2 mgo3 mgc and ter require a specific ozone dose of 1 5 mgo3 mgc to be degraded 0 5 mgo3 mgc are suficient for the degradation of act and tet the dissolved organic matter was significantly degraded as well by ozone but the overall mineralization rate was low a forecoming study will investigate the rejection of ozonation by products by nf 90 a pre ozonation enables the fouling resistance to be decreased by almost 40 to sum up it was demonstrated that coupling nf to a pre ozonation process is twicly benefic firstly it degrades well the micropollutants preventing from expensive specific processes in nf retentates management secondly it also mitigates nf fouling by degrading the dom inducing concomitantly to flux improvement

13688,the objective of this study was to develop an innovative and advanced integrated membrane and oxidation system for the treatment of domestic wastewater by coupling membrane bioreactor mbr nanofiltration nf and ozonation five contaminants were selected acetaminophen carbamazepin sulfamethoxazole tetracyclin and terbutryn the mbr effluent samples have been fully characterized using conventional analysis cod toc uv254 ionic chromatography and advanced characterization analyses 3d fluorescence excitation emission matrices 3deem before being spiked with 1 ppm of each of the selected pharmaceuticals nf process experiments were carried out in batch and semi batch mode using a flat sheet membrane system nf 90 selected omps were well rejected by nf between 84 and 98 and the main fouling mechanisms observed were pore blocking and gel layer formation mbr effluent was then pre treated in an ozonation pilot unit s with ozone gas inlet fixed at 5 g nm 3 the complete degradation by ozonation of carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole took 15 20 min and more than 30 min for terbutryn acetaminophen tetracyclin and dissolved organic matter were almost totally ozonated in

1 introduction to overcome water shortage which is becoming a growing worldwide challenge domestic wastewater dww must be considered as a promising water resource instead of mere waste indeed wastewater can be reused for different applications among which agricultural industrial and municipal uses but also for ground water recharge 1 even though occurrence of organic micropollutants omps in municipal wastewater constitutes an important limiting factor pointed out by many authors 2 4 according to ganiyu et al most of the pharmaceuticals administered for both human and animal uses are excreted unmodified via urine and feces and directly introduced into sewage systems 5 an important factor limiting the wastewater reuse is the inefficiency of conventional waste water treatment plant wwtp in removing omps 6 even in the case of secondary treatment processes improved by mbr omps are not fully removed and some specific compounds showed really low removal efficiencies between 8 and 32 for pesticides such as atrazine and fenoprop 7 consequently pharmaceuticals and antibiotics have been found widespread in different environmental compartments due to their persistence and low biodegradability 8 to fulfill public regulations requirements and achieve sustainable development goals in terms of ensuring safe and sustainable access to water sdg 6 un 9 tertiary treatment processes capable of removing bio resistant compounds are being developed and investigated activated carbon adsorption ozonation and membrane separation processes such as nf and ro have been investigated in wastewater treatment schemes tight nanofiltration and reverse osmosis remove well the majority of organic micropollutants above 95 the efficiency of such membrane processes depends mainly on the type of membrane the effluent matrix and the micropollutants physico chemical properties 10 12 these last years some authors have demonstrated that nanofiltration nf could be a good alternative to reverse osmosis ro for urban wastewater reuse 13 15 indeed it offers a very good compromise between permeability and selectivity due to the more important permeate flux compared to ro while having an acceptable omps removal nanofiltration requires less energy and seems more appropriate in an economical point of view for the treatment of such refractory effluents 16 17 however there is still the problem of the brine management and the propensity to fouling which both represent an object for many researchers mobilization 18 19 lan et al have investigated the performances of nf on mbr effluent and pointed out that colloidal organic fouling played a major role in flux decline 20 moreover according to mänttäri et al 21 the humic like substances adsorb onto the polyamide based thin film composite and cellulose acetate nf membrane surface forming a gel layer which induces an additional resistance to the flux passage 21 23 fersi et al distinguished two stages in fouling related to gel layer in filtration process the gel layer formation and the gel layer compression 24 because of a decrease in porosity the second stage accelerates the flux decline and this phenomenon was observed after 60 of recovery rate beside the membrane processes advanced oxidation processes are also investigated for omps elimination 25 they offer the advantages in degrading well micropollutants 26 ozone is the second most powerful oxidizing agent after hydroxyl radicals and is much more stable than hydroxyl radicals ozonation was firstly used as final treatment process for effluent disinfection and to oxidize iron and manganese in the end of 19th century 27 nowadays ozonation is subject to many investigation as promising treatment process to eliminate emerging omps 15 26 28 however oxidation sometimes leads to more toxic byproducts than parent compounds and an additional treatment must be added to remove this new toxicity from the final effluent 29 31 the aim of this study was to combine pre ozonation and nf processes to eliminate selected omps in real mbr secondary effluent combining ozonation with nf seems an appropriate synergetic solution to take advantages of these processes while limiting their drawbacks 32 34 indeed while nf membrane act as an efficient physical barrier against toxicity due to omps and their by products pre ozonation can efficiently degrades these refractory pollutants and also maintain the good flux performances of the nf process by limiting membrane fouling the specific objectives were to investigate the fouling propensity and omps removal mechanisms in nf to study the effect of the matrix composition on ozonation process and to evaluate the effect of pre ozonation on fouling and flux evolution in nf 2 materials and methods 2 1 micropollutants and matrix selection 2 1 1 selection of micropollutants four pharmaceuticals acetaminophen act carbamazepine cbz sulfamethoxazole sul and tetracyclin tet and one herbicide terbutryn ter have been selected for this study table 1 these molecules were selected because of their representativeness for different class of emerging contaminants found widespread in wwtp secondary effluent 8 35 38 the diversity of their mw hydrophobicity log kow and oxidation rates ko3 some of these molecules especially the terbutryn are in the list of the 15 new priority substances which have to be completely removed from all treated ww by 2020 directive 2013 39 eu in order to be able to determine low concentrations in permeate when high rejection rate of the membrane are achieved the feed solution was spiked with 1000 μgl 1 of each omp all the products were purchased from sigma aldrich france and were of analytical grade 2 1 2 synthetic effluent as reference matrix ultrapure water was spiked with 1000 μgl 1 of each targeted micropollutants before running any experiment with the real mbr effluent this matrix was used first and served as comparison baseline 2 1 3 real effluent the real effluent was taken from a full scale domestic wwtp equipped with mbr located close to montpellier france the plant was designed to treat 13 000 m3 d of domestic wastewater and was performing biological nitrogen removal nitrification denitrification mbr was equipped with kubota submerged membrane unit smu rw400 kubota japan flat sheet microporous membranes made of chlorinated polyethylene total surface of 16 240 m² with an average pore size of 0 2 μm the characteristics of the mbr permeate are presented in table 2 the effluent was immediately stored at nearly 4 c after sampling in order to limit the variation of the composition and rewarm at room temperature 20 c 1 c before conducting the experiments no significant change was observed in the sample characteristics after the storage period 2 2 membranes selection and nanofiltration protocol 2 2 1 membranes selection and characterization the nf 90 polyamide membrane from dow filmtec has been selected for this study this membrane is considered as a tight nf membrane with an estimated mwco around 150 da which seems appropriate for the retention of the selected micropollutant before experimentation each membrane has been firstly soaked in ultrapure water to remove preservative agent then compacted at 18 bars for one hour at least or still stability of the flux was reached thereafter these membranes have been fully characterized in terms of permeability and sodium chloride retention the nf 90 membrane permeability was determined at 10 bars at 8 4 1 0 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 with a nacl rejection close to 88 4 after experiments membranes were stored in a 200 mg l 1 na2so3 solution at 4 c 2 2 2 cross flow nanofiltration unit and experimental protocol an osmonics sepa cf ii cell sterlitech corp was used to carry out the filtration experiments using flat sheet membrane coupons with an effective membrane area of 140 cm² a pump hydra cell wanner engineering inc was used to feed the sepa cell with the solution from a 16 l feed vessel fig 1 a cryothermostat f32 julabo maintained constant the feed water temperature 20 1 c to prevent an increase in liquid flow temperature during this study the transmembrane pressure tmp was regulated using a micrometric pressure control valve located on the retentate outlet experiments were performed at a cross flow velocity vt of 0 5 m s 1 with a spacer in feed channel of 47 mil 1 194 mm the bench scale nf system was operated at a constant tmp of 10 bars all along the filtration experiment until reaching 80 of water recovery or at least the maximum water recovery reachable the effect of the pressure on the nf membrane efficiency has been examined at different water recovery rates corresponding to 0 15 40 and 60 at 6 8 and 10 bar pressure it has to be noted that in order to evaluate the effect of the pressure at a fixed water recovery the concentrate and permeate was both recirculated into the feed tank finally after each filtration experiment the nf unit was cleaned by first recirculating caustic soda naoh 2 solution then acid hno3 2 solution after each base and acid cleaning the system is fully rinsed with deionized water until a conductivity of 50 μs cm 1 and a neutral ph were reached before the experiment the feed water was placed in the storage tank and recirculated for 24 h vt 0 5 m s 1 without tmp to ensure

computer samples were collected from each compartment feed concentrated and permeate for analysis the volume of the collected sample for different analysis was considered in the mass balance and the apparent rejection calculation considering that the nf system is made of stainless steel material it was assumed that compound micropollutant or organic matter adsorption is exclusively occurring on membrane material 2 2 3 fouling characterization membrane fouling was estimated considering the flux recovery after different type of washing procedure reversible fouling was evaluated first

in the solution a recirculating pump is used for sampling the experiment consists in applying an ozone gas concentration and to determine the transferred ozone doze finally the specific ozone doze was defined on a well characterized effluent different contact times were tested depending on the parameter the experiment aimed to monitor 0 min to 5 h 2 4 evaluation of the nanofiltration nf and

3 nf removal rate determination the nf removal rate of any parameter is determined by the difference between the feed and permeate concentrations it is then divided by feed concentration and expressed in percentage 2 r c feed c p c feed with r removal rate cfeed concentration in feed stream cp concentration in permeate stream 2 4 4 dissolved organic matter dom characterization using 3deem fluorescence a perkin elmer ls 55 spectrometer usa was used to produce 3deem spectra measurements set up and data analysis were described in details in jacquin et al 41 samples were scanned in ranges

nf system the performances of the nf system has been evaluated on both synthetic and real effluents taking into account the permeate flux and omps retention the experimentations have been conducted during 15 25 hours in order to reach at least 80 of water recovery y 80 removal rates of toc and ions in real mbr effluent by nf90 have been presented in a previous study azais et al 2014 depending of the stage of fouling by real mbr effluent with virgin membrane or with fouled membranes nf 90 membranes are able to reject between 92 and 98 of toc between 83 and 97 of monovalent ions cl na k and no3 and between 93 and 100 of divalent ions so4 2 mg2 ca2 3 1 1 flux evolution as a reference baseline an experiment was conducted on ultrapure water spiked with 1000 μg l of each selected omps thereafter same experiment was conducted with a new membrane coupon on real mbr effluent also spiked with omps in order to evaluate the impact of such matrix on water flux decline the results of these experiments are presented in fig 3 with the relative flux ratio between the actual flux and the initial flux on the y axis according to the recovery rates on the x axis the flux decline evolution associated to the filtration of the synthetic solution the reference baseline displays only a slight decrease in the flux 24 after 17 h corresponding of 85 water recovery this might be explained by steric hindrance of higher mw omps and adsorption of the most hydrophobic omps which reduce slightly the flux concerning the real mbr effluent filtration the flux decrease is much more pronounced up to 68 reduction of the initial flux after 25 h experiment corresponding to 80 of water recovery the major factor leading to the flux drop could come from dissolved and colloidal organic matter dcom fouling associated to high molecular weight compounds such as protein like fulvic and humic like substances such substances have been identified as revealed by the 3deem fluorescence spectrometry fig 7 in addition to the colloidal fouling the real mbr effluent contains non negligible salts concentration see table 2 considering that tight nf membrane such as nf 90 has relatively high salt rejection it induces inevitably a difference of salt concentration on both side of the membrane resulting in a decrease of the driving force due to osmotic pressure difference salt concentration increase in the feed compartment with the water recovery resulting in an increasing osmotic pressure 3 1 2 monitoring of removal performances during nf omps removal mechanisms during the previous experiment samples were taken from nf feed and permeate streams to monitor the influence of recovery rate on selected micropollutants removal moreover to assess the impact of the tmp on micropollutants removal samples were also picked for each recovery rate at different pressures 6 8 and 10 bars removal rates at 0 1 and 80 recovery rates are shown in fig 4 removal rate of micropollutants is related to its molecular weight the bigger it is the better the removal is except for act for which the molecular weight 151 da is on the limit of the mwco of the membrane estimated to 150 200 da a very good removal rate has been observed for all the other selected micropollutants so the main removal mechanism seems to be steric hindrance as it was also observed by other authors 11 these authors noticed an impact of real effluent matrix on the retention of uncharged micropollutants in our study additionally to the size exclusion an adsorption competition test using calcium revealed that the tetracyclin was also adsorbed on the effluent organic matter and that adsorption on organic matter may improve its retention for the most hydrophobic compounds carbamazepin and terbutryn interactions with fouled membrane surface might contribute to their removal 5 sulfamethoxazol is charged negatively and might undergo in electrostatic repulsive interactions with the membrane surface thus electrostatic repulsion could contribute to enhance its removal as shown on fig 4 omps removal rate is also linked to the fouling state of the membrane omps removal is lower at 0 1 water recovery where the membrane was unfouled than for the fouled membrane at 80 water recovery as already observed by other authors fouling layer constitutes a second barrier to improve the nf membrane removal ability 20 22 23 3 2 ozonation of mbr real effluent the ozone based degradation of dissolved organic matter dom and selected micropollutants was investigated and in this aim the instantaneous ozone demand iod constitutes a key parameter which was first determined 3 2 1 instantaneous ozone demand determination in order to optimize the specific ozone dose to apply the iod and consumption coefficient k were firstly determined the iod corresponds to the transferred ozone dose tod that is instantaneously consumed by the organic matter of the effluent with k mn 1 the consumption kinetics before any remaining ozone is detected in the outlet liquid phase the two parameters were determined according to roustan et al method and their values are 3 76 mgo3 mgdoc fig 5 corresponding to a specific ozone doze of 0 56 mgo3 mgc and 0 064 mn 1 respectively 44 3 2 2 ozonation of real wastewater the ozonation of the real wastewater were monitored through following parameters uv254 cod and toc in order to better understand the phenomenon the experiments were run for 5 h fig 6 shows the evolution of sub mentioned parameters as a function of both time and ratio tod toc it can be seen in fig 6 that the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm drastically decreases since the beginning of the reaction to stabilize after 30 min 2 1 mgo3 mgc indeed by attacking the double bound of the carbon chain monitored throughout the uv absorbance at 254 nm the ozonation process is known to be efficient in aromaticity degradation 15 45 moreover the cod decreases for 40 from its initial value of 32 mgo2 l in the first 15 min 20 min 1 2 1 5 mgo3 mgc to stabilize around 50 as revealed by previous studies 32 46 the curve of toc degradation over time confirms the inefficiency of ozone in terms of organic matter mineralization with only a very slight decrease even after five hours of ozonation 32 the low change in toc is not detrimental because ozonation main goal is to limit the fouling of nf by transforming dcom into lower mw compounds the second goal of ozone at this stage is to transform bio refractory molecules into more biodegradable compounds that should be further biodegraded after recirculation of nf concentrate to the mbr furthermore the evolution of organic matter was characterized through three dimensional emission excitation fluorescence 3deem 3deem spectra and the percentage of fractions are illustrated in fig 7 3deem spectrum presented in fig 7 a demonstrate that mbr permeate is mainly constituted of fluorescent molecules located in the protein like and smp like regions zones ii and iii as well as in the fulvic like and humic like substances regions zones iv and v fig 7c shows that dom repartition in fractions does not change significantly during 30 min ozonation time 2 1 mgo3 mgc however an important decrease of the overall volume of fluorescence was observed after only 5 min ozonation contact time with almost 70 drop then a slight linearly decrease over time to reach almost 90 drop after 30 min of ozonation fig 7 b the differences between fig 7a and b is due to the first 5 min of reaction 0 5 mgo3 mgc these results are concordant with the observation of liu et al who monitored the evolution of dcom during ozonation and noticed a significant decrease in the intensities of all dcom fluorophores after 30 min ozonation contact time 2 1 mgo3 mgc 47 3 2 3 ozonation of micropollutants in real wastewater during the ozonation of real mbr effluent before coupling with nf the degradation rate of five selected micropollutants has been monitored for 30 min and the results are presented in fig 8 the monitoring of the degradation of the selected micropollutants revealed three categories of micropollutants the first group constituted by act and tet which shows 90 degradation rate in the first 5 min 0 5 mgo3 mgc and total degradation after 10 min 0 9 mgo3 mgc of ozonation reaction time this has been confirmed by some authors who have determined the ozone reactivity kinetics constants ko3 for these molecules 48 50 for act najjar et al obtained 2 6 106 m 1 s 1 in pure water and for tet khan et al evaluated the ozone reactivity kinetics constant at 1 9 106 m 1 s 1 50 51 the second group composed of cbz and sul shows 70 degradation in the first 10 min and almost total degradation after 15 min 1 2 mgo3 mgc to 20 min 1 5 mgo3 mgc of ozonation reaction time the ozone reactivity kinetics coefficients have been determined in literature for this second group as well 3 0 105 m 1 s 1 and 2 5 106 m 1 s 1 were obtained for cbz and sul respectively 49 finally the third category including ter is the less reactive compound to ozone 70 of the initial concentration is degraded by ozone after 20 min and only a degradation of 90 95 of the initial concentration is achieved after 25 min 30 min 2 1 mgo3 mgc reaction time terbutryn is part of a class of micropollutants triazins known to be more resistant to ozone degradation the low reactivity towards ozone of the compound may be explained by stability of triazinic rings 52 3 3 impact of pre ozonation on nf performances in order to investigate the impact of the pre ozonation on the nanofiltration performances some experiments were conducted immediately after mbr effluent ozonation the performances were compared to that of non ozonated matrix as the micropollutants were almost totally degraded during ozonation their removal was not monitored in ozonated matrix except for the terbutryn which is still present at significant concentration 30 μg l but totally eliminated at 80 of water recovery so the impact of pre ozonation on nf is limited to the flux and the fouling study 3 3 1 impact of pre ozonation on nf flux evolution in this section the impact of ozonation on nanofiltration efficiency permeability has been studied the flux evolution for both reference and real mbr effluent ozonated and non ozonated are presented in fig 9 fig 9 reveals that due to the degradation of dom see 3deem on fig 7 during the pre ozonation the flux decline is always lower in case of ozonated matrix than that of non ozonated matrix when the real effluent matrix has been ozonated for 15 min the flux is slightly improved and the decrease in the initial flux is about 65 y 80 indeed nearly 3 and 8 of flux improvement average can be observed after 15 min and 30 min ozonation respectively these flux improvement on real ozonated effluent can be attributed to the oxidation of the protein like fulvic and humic like substances as revealed by the 3deem fluorescence spectrometry fig 7 ozonation induced a structural change in dom by decomposing carbon carbon double bonds and aromatic rings of humic substances 45 53 concerning upw no significant change of flux is observed with pre ozonation which is logical due to the absence of dom it has to be noted that the evolution of the flux in case of upw spiked or not indicate that the presence of micropollutants induced a drop flux of about 20 for y 80 3 4 fouling and resistance of the nf membrane in order to better investigate the impact of the pre ozonation the resistance to the flux for both reference and real mbr effluent ozonated and non ozonated are recapitulated in table 4 table 4 revealed that the ozonation induced for both matrixes a decrease in the overall resistance the reduction of the resistance mainly comes from fouling which was structurally modified by the ozonation as shown in fig 10 a moreover according to the type of washing and subsequent flux recovered the percentages of reversible and irreversible fouling for reference and real mbr effluent matrixes spiked with micropollutants ozonated and non ozonated were also determined and presented in fig 10 b fig 10 a revealed that the pre ozonation induced a decrease of about 40 of the fouling resistance for both matrixes for instance from a fouling resistance of 1014 m 1 after ozonation of real mbr effluent the fouling resistance is only about 6 0 1013 m 1 the fouling characterization confirmed that the pre ozonation enable a mitigation of the fouling propensity during nf especially in the case of real mbr effluent by modifying the dcom structure which led to a dcom more hydrophilic and with less propensity to promote irreversible fouling 33 54 in fact while for the non ozonated mbr effluent only 36 of the initial flux was recovered up to 53 of the initial flux were recovered by a mere ultrapure water cleaning for membrane fouled by ozonated real mbr effluent fig 10 b the opposite effect was observed in the case of upw because the fouling mainly came from omps after ozonation the omps were degraded except the terbutryn which might induce a slightly higher irreversible fouling 4 conclusion the overall objective of the paper was to investigate the impact of a pre ozonation on nf process performances during tertiary treatment of a mbr secondary effluent fouling and micropollutants removal mechanisms during nanofiltration experiments with real mbr effluent have been investigated degradation of a mixture of five micropollutants and dom during ozonation were also studied fouling investigation revealed that size exclusion was the main mechanism of micropollutants rejection in addition gel layer onto fouled membrane formed a supplementary barrier which contributed to enhance micropollutants retention the micropollutants were globally well retained by nf 90 membrane during ozonation relatively high degardation rates were achieved for micropollutants requiring different specific ozone doses in fact while cbz and sul require a specific ozone doze of 1 2 mgo3 mgc and ter require a specific ozone dose of 1 5 mgo3 mgc to be degraded 0 5 mgo3 mgc are suficient for the degradation of act and tet the dissolved organic matter was significantly degraded as well by ozone but the overall mineralization rate was low a forecoming study will investigate the rejection of ozonation by products by nf 90 a pre ozonation enables the fouling resistance to be decreased by almost 40 to sum up it was demonstrated that coupling nf to a pre ozonation process is twicly benefic firstly it degrades well the micropollutants preventing from expensive specific processes in nf retentates management secondly it also mitigates nf fouling by degrading the dom inducing concomitantly to flux improvement

13689,in this work zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were successfully synthesized using sol gel method the effect of zro2 doped into tio2 on the retardation of the electron hole pairs were investigated the crystalline structure of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts was verified through x ray diffraction xrd patterns and the crystallite size were found smaller compared to tio2 and zro2 photocatalysts morphological characterization evidenced that the co doping of zro2 into tio2 has altered the particle size of tio2 and the shape of the synthesized particle through chemical nucleation and growth process in bulk solution the small crystallite size of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction recorded the highest surface area with higher incident in the mesopores volume as confirmed by brunauer emmett teller bet analysis the adsorption photodegradation performance of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts on oily wastewater as model pollutant enhanced with the incorporation of small amount of zro2 compared to tio2 the presence of surface adsorbed water peaks and hydroxyl groups as disclosed by fourier transform infrared ftir supported the finding of the study keywords zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts oily wastewater photodegradation photocatalytic activity 1 introduction oily wastewater is a complex substance which usually contains high concentrations of dispersed oil grease suspended particles 1 fats hydrocarbons as well as petroleum fractions such as diesel oil gasoline and kerosene 2 many industries such as petrochemical refineries oil distribution companies food producers and machining factories release a significant quantity of oil containing wastewater into water body 3 the oily wastewater has different undesirable impacts on the immediate environment such as atmosphere contamination caused by the vaporization of oil and hydrocarbon contents to the environment oily wastewater discharge without proper treatment can influence groundwater salt water or drinking water because of the percolation of contaminants in produced water into the water resources underneath the earth and create ecological problems 4 apart from that the frequent oil spill to seawater and its ecotoxicological effect threatens the marine and coastal ecosystems 5 diversities of treatment methods geared in the direction of oil impurities exclusion can be used to alleviate the undesirable effects of oily wastewaters 2 despite many approaches carried out to treat oily wastewater 4 9 most of them suffer from major drawbacks such as expensive maintenance lateness in separation time fouling high retention time and less efficient at higher feed concentration 10 some studies demonstrated the feasibility of using photocatalysis to treat oily wastewater owing to its environmentally friendliness and high oxidation efficiency 11 13 photocatalysis is an advanced oxidation process aop that able to completely mineralize contamination in both liquid and gas phase under ambient pressure and temperature 14 the ability of aop to generate powerful oxidizing agent makes it an effective technology 15 in photocatalysis the rate of chemical transformation is enhanced by the photocatalyst under light irradiation 16 photocatalysis also has immense potential to produce decontaminated water 17 promising results have been attained by photocatalysis for industrial wastewater treatment to remove a wide range of contaminants such as aromatics pesticides and pharmaceuticals as well as oil and grease 18 the exploration of titanium dioxide tio2 photocatalysts since 1972 19 has led to the widespread application of this effective semiconductor photocatalyst 20 for the removal of various pollutants 21 including organic pollutants photodegradation in both water and air 22 23 chemical stability remarkable oxidation ability 24 25 low cost non toxicity long term stability and photostability are the favourable characteristics which make tio2 the most promising photocatalysts to degrade pollutants and produce hydrogen 26 heterojunction photocatalysis using tio2 is by far the most studied oxidation process for the mineralization of pollutants into harmless products through the generation of electron hole e h pairs when the semiconductor is exposed to uv radiation 18 also the hydroxyl radicals oh produced by photocatalysis have high oxidizing power of 2 80 v 17 even though tio2 is renowned for its chemical and physical stability tio2 is prone to go through phase transformation from anatase to rutile 27 this phenomenon has a detrimental effect on tio2 since rutile phase is known to decrease the surface area of tio2 which reduces the photocatalytic performance 28 due to the recombination of e h pairs 29 however this shortcoming could be minimized through the introduction of second metal oxide such as la2o3 sio2 sno2 and zro2 introduction of metal oxide into tio2 was reported to induce significant degradation under uv irradiation 30 and can generate oxygen vacancies through the substitution of divalent or trivalent atoms by tetravalent atoms and give rise to particle particle interaction 31 in this study zro2 was introduced because it has been proven effective in suppressing the phase transformation of tio2 27 and increasing the surface area of photocatalysts owing to the stabilization of the active phase in a finely dispersed state 32 as a result zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts have been extensively studied by many researchers 33 38 the introduction of small quantity of zro2 into tio2 can improve the chemical stability and boost the photocatalytic activities of tio2 36 39 40 typical tio2 based heterojunction photocatalysts include conventional heterojunctions type i type ii and type iii p n heterojunctions and direct z scheme heterojunctions conventional heterojunctions consist of type i with straddling gap type ii with staggered gap and type iii with a broken gap 41 nowadays tio2 based heterojunction photocatalysts have attracted wide attention and utilized for various application this is due to the effectiveness of heterojunction photocatalysts in facilitating charge transfer and suppressing the recombination of photogenerated e h pairs which help to improve the photocatalytic performance 42 li et al 43 explored the potential of ticx sicx heterojunction semiconductor as anode material later gnanasekaran et al 44 reported the improvement in the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutant using the hybrid of fe3o4 and tio2 to the best of our knowledge the treatment of oily wastewaters using zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalyst that is based on metal doped semiconductor has not yet been reported in this study modified sol gel method was used to dope zro2 into tio2 to produce zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts with high surface area the incorporation of zro2 into tio2 is expected to promote the separation of e h pairs which reduce recombination 17 and the migration of surface oxygen species improve the photocatalytic activity 45 the characteristics of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts such as specific surface area pore size pore volume particle size crystal phase structure optical band gap surface morphology e h pairs transition elemental composition and functional groups were also determined the oily wastewater adsorption photodegradation performance estimated from total organic carbon toc degradation verified that the quality of the treated oily wastewater has met the regulatory standards 2 materials and experimental 2 1 chemicals and reagents

photocatalysts tio2 zro2 and zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were synthesized using sol gel method as described elsewhere 33 in which ttip and tpz were used as precursors for tio2 and zro2 respectively a typical procedure for the preparation of tio2 was carried out by mixing 10 ml of ttip with 90 ml of ipa the mixture was then added dropwise into 900 ml of d i water that was maintained at the ph of 1 5 using nitric acid by means of portable ph meter hq11d hach and the mixture was mechanically stirred using a magnetic stirrer at 700 rpm or until a single central vertical vortex was formed the reaction tub was filled up with crushed ice to keep the temperature approximately at 2 c during the mixing stage the mixture was stirred vigorously for 20 h at ambient temperature to obtain colloidal sol after the aging period of 24 h at room temperature the colloidal sol was precipitated through evaporative drying using hotplate until the colloidal sol was transformed into tio2 crystals the resulting photocatalysts were then dried in vacuum oven at 105 c for 4 h and later calcined at 500 c in furnace nabertherm gmbh with air flowing continuously for 3 h to remove the solvents 46 the dried photocatalysts were then ground and sieved into fine powder prior to testing the same experimental conditions were used to synthesize zro2 and zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts with different zro2 mole content loaded into tio2 and reported in this study as 1 5 10 15 20 50 and 80 zro2 tio2 the molarity ratio of ti and zr samples was 0 017 0 016 2 3 preparation of synthetic oily wastewater the oily wastewater was prepared by mixing nine parts of the pre mixed commercial cutting oil ridgid ridge tool company ohio usa with one part of sdbs in a high speed blender model bl 310aw khind within the surrounding environment at the speed 50 hz for about 2 min as described elsewhere 47 the desired amount of cutting oil and sdbs mixture were mixed with 1 l of d i water to prepare the synthetic oily wastewater with concentration of 100 ppm prior to the evaluation of photocatalytic activity the calibration curve of the oily wastewater was prepared the emulsion had maximum uv absorption at 223 nm wavelength perkin elmer uv vis spectrometer lambda 25 was utilized to measure the absorbance of oily wastewater at different concentration at 223 nm the related λmax did not change with oil concentration in the emulsion linear calibration curve with a coefficient of correlation r2 of 0 993 was obtained as shown in fig s1 2 4 characterization of photocatalysts the xrd patterns of the as prepared photocatalysts were acquired by rigaku d max rb 12 kw x ray diffractometer equipped with nickel filtered copper kα radiation λ 1 54056 å operated at 30 ma and 40 kv the

spectra of the prepared sample was determined using shimadzhu axis ultradld with al kα radiation monochromatic source ftir spectra were recorded in perkin elmer spectrum system the photocatalysts were mixed with kbr and the ratio of photocatalysts to kbr was maintained as 1 100 the mixture was pressed under 10 tons cm 2 to produce a 300 mg pellet 2 5 adsorption studies the adsorption studies of oily wastewater onto zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were done to determine the adsorption capacity of the as synthesized samples 0 35 g of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were added in 350 ml of 100 ppm oily wastewater and continuously stirred at a speed of 350 rpm to ensure the homogeneity of the suspension contents at 25 c in dark condition the suspension was stirred in dark condition for 120 min to establish the adsorption desorption equilibrium 40 of oily wastewater on the photocatalysts as well as to ensure no photocatalysis occurred during this period during the reaction suspensions were collected with a syringe at timed intervals and filtered before the aliquot was analysed using uv vis and later using toc analyser the adsorbed amount of oily wastewater at equilibrium qe mg g was calculated by the following eq 2 2 q e c 0 c e v w the adsorption percentage and the adsorption capacity of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were calculated from eqs 3

photocatalysts used during adsorption experiments 49 2 6 photocatalytic activity evaluation after the adsorption desorption period the uv light was turned on and the photocatalytic activities were measured via photodegradation of oily wastewater in aqueous solution at atmospheric pressure and room temperature the suspension was irradiated using an 8 w black light blue uv a lamp with a maximum light intensity output at 365 nm fl8blb sankyo denki co ltd japan the uv light intensity was measured using a uvx radiometer with uv a sensor uvx 36 uvp inc upland ca the light distance was fixed at 1 cm from the prepared suspension 15 ml of aliquots were withdrawn from the suspension every 60 min within 300 min of uv irradiation to evaluate the apparent reaction rate constant and the photocatalysts were filtered using a ptfe membrane thermo scientific titan3 30 mm filter blue 0 2 μm before the supernatant was analysed using toc analyser eight supernatants were collected in total and continuously measured from the collection tube vial with single oct l unit and combusted at 720 2 c using the combustion catalytic oxidation method the oily wastewater degradation in aqueous solution was determined using eq 5 5 t o c d e g r a d a t i o n 1 t o c t t o c 0 100 where toc0 and toct are the toc concentration of the degraded oily wastewater ppm at initial and at reaction time t respectively 2 7 regeneration study to investigate the stability of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts the reuse of the photocatalyst has been studied the entire photocatalytic stability test has been carried out under identical reaction conditions at the end of the uv irradiation the utilized photocatalysts were filtered and washed carefully with 50 ml of distilled water for 3 times then the washed photocatalysts were dried in a hot air oven at 105 c for 1 h to remove the water contained in the photocatalysts to be used in the subsequent run 2 8 kinetics of photocatalytic reactions the langmuir hinshelwood model as shown in eq 6 was employed to describe the kinetics of photocatalytic reactions of organic pollutants this model relates the reaction rate r mg l min with the reactant concentration c mg l 6 r d c d t k f k a d c 1 k a d c where kf is the reaction rate constant mg l min and kad is the adsorption constant l mg when the adsorption is relatively weak and or

d 3 results and discussion 3 1 crystallinity analysis fig 1 illustrates the xrd patterns of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts after calcined at 500 c in comparison with the tio2 and zro2 photocatalysts the position of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction peaks closely resembled the properties of tio2 with the characteristic diffraction peak of anatase tio2 at 2θ 25 3 1 0 1 37 8 0 0 4 48 0 2 0 0 53 8 1 0 5 and 55 0 2 1 1 the appreciably sharp peak with high intensity suggested that the tio2 consisted of bigger particles size the crystalline tio2 anatase phase has a tetragonal crystal system space group of i41 amd the lattice constants were closed to the mostly reported tio2 photocatalysts with band gap of 3 2 ev 50 calcination of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts resulted in the crystal deformation of interstratified structure among metal oxide units 51 the broad peaks with a large full width half maximum fwhm indicated that the as synthesized photocatalysts were governed by the crystalline structure of anatase tio2 this also suggested that the crystallinity of the primary peak tio2 was well conserved during the co doping of zro2 however the crystallinity of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts decreased with the increasing zro2 content as measured by the reference intensity ratio rir clearly co doping small quantity of zro2 as little as 1 into tio2 affected the crystallinity of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts through anatase phase stabilization which was more favourable for photocatalytic applications 52 the tetragonal zro2 phase was successfully suppressed the tio2 pattern was observed to be intense in the 1 zro2 tio2 formulation because tio2 diffracts more efficiently compared to zro2 in this composition with at least four peaks matched the principal diffraction peaks of tio2 peaks of anatase rutile and brookite were all present addition of zro2 did not affect any structural properties co doping of zro2 from 5 to 20 revealed only anatase tio2 and monoclinic zro2 phases however cubic peaks started to appear at 50 zro2 tio2 the increase in fwhm along with the decrease in peak intensity implied that zro2 doped into tio2 lattice has resulted in the lowering of crystallite size of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts as summarized in table s1 the reduction in the average crystallite size as measured at peak 1 0 1 around 5 12 nm suggested that the anatase phase is stable dauksta et al 52 mentioned that anatase phased nanoparticles are highly stable with the size of less than 14 nm the smaller crystallite size resulted in higher surface to volume ratio which helped to enhance the photocatalytic activity 53 the baddeleyite zro2 monoclinic crystals dominated the primary phase when the zro2 was further increase to 80 wt also all characteristic peaks indexing to the counterparts did not show any shifts at zro2 quantity of 1 20 wt which ascertain the prosperous coupling of these nanoparticles to construct the heterojunction photocatalysts 3 2 textural analysis according to iupac classification the physisorption isotherm of the photocatalysts were classified as type iv and having a distinctive h1 hysteresis loop which indicated mesoporous materials as shown in fig 2 a with all zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts exhibited higher specific surface area compared to tio2 the specific surface area increased about 242 from 39 928 m2 g to 136 671 m2 g when 1 zro2 was doped into tio2 co doping of zro2 into tio2 increased the specific surface area due to rise in mesopore volume as the result of inhibition of tio2 crystal growth 54 and due to the fine dispersion of zro2 particles on the surface of tio2 55 the specific surface area reduced by 17 113 919 m2 g for the 5 zro2 tio2 which may be due to the settling of zro2 particles in the pores of tio2 56 the specific surface area gradually increased to 129 414 and 131 741 m2 g for the 10 and 15 zro2 tio2 respectively the 20 zro2 tio2 recorded the highest specific surface area of 144 492 m2 g there was no clear trend with the changes in the specific surface area as have been expected the radius pore size decreased as the specific surface area increased it was also noticeable that the total pore volume increased with higher mesopores volume recorded over micropores volume 1 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts showed significant improvement in pore volume compared to pure tio2 which suggested that co doping of zro2 into tio2 lead towards photocatalysts with higher porosity and desirable for photocatalytic activity 57 meanwhile the pore size distribution showed a higher incidence of mesopores in the range of 2 to 4 nm for tio2 fig 2 b and 4 7 nm for zro2 fig 2 c all zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts and tio2 recorded similar pore size distribution value such observation suggested that the structural properties of the mesopores were well maintained with only small changes fig 2 d h the textural properties of the as synthesized photocatalysts are tabulated in table 1 co doping a small quantity of zro2 into tio2 would increase the specific surface area of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts which helped to provide more reaction site for redox processes to occur 58 3 3 surface morphological and elemental composition analysis the morphological images of the tio2 and zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts obtained from fesem is shown in fig 3 tio2 photocatalysts fig 3 a has a clear spherical shape nanoparticle when zro2 phase was doped into tio2 the photocatalysts exhibited smaller spherical size of nanoparticles with increased co doping of zro2 from 1 to 20 the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts revealed the uniform dispersion of zro2 on the surface of tio2 with small agglomeration observed zro2 were densely deposited onto the surface of tio2 due to interfacial interactions and preferential heterogeneous nucleation fig 3 b f the formation of the heterojunction photocatalysts were originated through direct deposition of heterogeneous nucleation and growth of zro2 into tio2 throughout the synthesis course 59 the different shapes resulted through co doping of zro2 into tio2 exhibited greater active surfaces with respect to spherical nanoparticles 60 and increased the photocatalytic performance fig 4 shows the tem images of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts the average grain size of the heterojunction photocatalysts is around 12 nm the fringe spacing of 0 352 nm matched the 1 0 1 plane of anatase tio2 while the fringe spacing of 0 368 nm matched the 0 1 1 plane of monoclinic zro2 the edx spectrum shown in fig 5 confirmed the presence of chemical constituents in zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts the signals of ti zr and o elements were detected at their respective energy levels this further evidence that the zro2 has been successfully coupled with tio2 to form a heterojunction photocatalysts the signals represent the presence of au was resulted from the gold used for sputtering it was also noticed that the elements were uniformly distributed throughout the sample 3 4 optical analysis fig s2 a and b showed the estimated optical band gap energy of tio2 zro2 and zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts with zro2 mole percent of 1 5 10 15 and 20 according to the results the band gap energy values of tio2 and zro2 were 3 10 and 5 10 ev respectively the optical band gap energy of 1 and 5 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were slightly lower than that of tio2 with 2 97 and 3 07 ev respectively the decrease in band gap was due to the increase in oxygen vacancies that helped to delocalize the impurity states that overlapped with the edge of valence band hence resulted in the photocatalyst with lower energy band gap 61 reduction in optical band gap energy had realized the heterojunction photocatalysts practicalities that allowed better absorption of photons to excite the electrons in the valence band vb however as the zro2 doped into tio2 increased to 10 15 and 20 the heterojunction photocatalysts exhibited increased optical band gap energy of 3 17 3 18 and 3 24 ev respectively due to the wider band gap of zro2 increased in optical band gap energy decreased the number of photons that the photocatalysts can absorb 62 the fluorescence emission spectra of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts are shown in fig s3 a and b the extinction of the fluorescence intensity at excitation source of 233 nm exhibited the following order zro2 tio2 20 zro2 tio2 10 zro2 tio2 5 zro2 tio2 15 zro2 tio2 1 zro2 tio2 co doping small zro2 content into tio2 lowered the e h recombination rates due to the formation of surface trap site and lattice defects which helped extend the lifetime of electrons on the conduction band cb increased metal doping concentrations resulted in the increase of fluorescence intensity this indicated faster recombination rate that might be due to the inefficient diffusion of zr into tio2 lattice as describe elsewhere 35 in the heterojunction photocatalyst the zr4 ions were surrounded by o ti bonds forming a zr o ti bonding structure in the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts as shown in fig 6 a of xps spectra the peak of ti2p could be fitted with two peaks at binding energies of 465 04 ev and 459 45 ev fig 6 b assigned to ti2p1 2 and ti2p3 2 of ti4 chemical state ti o bond respectively these two peaks were corresponded to ti iv in anatase tio2 63 a significant difference between the two binding energies was around 5 59 ev indicating that titanium existed as ti4 chemical state in the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts the peak of o1s could also be fitted with two peaks at binding energies of 532 72 ev and 530 69 ev fig 6 c which ascribed to oh and o2 respectively this confirmed the existence of surface hydroxyl groups in the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts at least three signals were observed from the peaks of binding energy for zr3d of xps spectra fig 6 d the peaks at 182 ev and 185 ev can be attributed to the zr3d3 2 and zr3d5 2 in zro2 tio2 domain respectively which was affected by the o ti chemical bonds in zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts the peaks at 182 6 ev and 185 2 ev were ascribed to the zr3d3 2 and zr3d5 2 in zro2 domain respectively the successful incorporation formation mechanism of heterogeneous zro2 into tio2 to form hybridized zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts could be that zro2 partly dispersed in tio2 material hybridized with tio2 on its boundary gradually a mixed of zro2 tio2 phase was formed and hetero condensation between zirconia and titania yield the zroti bonding structure similar findings were reported elsewhere 46 the effect of zro2 doping on the band gap structure was further elucidated by obtaining the band gap edges position to better classify the as prepared zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts as a prospective photocatalyst for oily wastewater treatment the vb and cb edge positions of the photocatalysts were calculated according to the mulliken electronegativity theory herein the electronegativity of an atom is the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the first ionisation energy 64 the vb and cb positions were determined by using the following reactions 11 e v b x e e 0 5 e g 12 e c b e v b e g where ecb and evb are the bottom cb and the top vb relative to the normal hydrogen electrode nhe and eg means the band gap energy ee is the energy of free electrons 4 5 ev x is the electronegativity of the semiconductor in this study the eg of tio2 and zro2 was estimated as 3 1 and 5 1 respectively as shown in fig s2 a and b the x value of 5 81 ev was used in eq 9 to determine the evb for tio2 and all zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts for zro2 the x value of 5 91 ev was used 38 based on the band gap positions the cb and vb edge potentials of zro2 were determined at 1 14 ev and 3 96 ev respectively meanwhile the cb and vb edge potentials of tio2 were calculated as 0 24 ev and 2 86 ev respectively the transition of electrons from the vb of zro2 and tio2 to cb occurred under uv irradiation and the same number of holes were left in the corresponding vb position in comparison to the ecb value of tio2 the ecb value of zro2 was more negative hence the electrons moved from the cb of zro2 to the cb of tio2 and promote charge separation at the heterojunction interface meanwhile the holes migrated from vb of zro2 to vb of tio2 similar observation was reported elsewhere 65 this finding suggested that charge separation enhancement occurred between electrons and holes which suppressed the e h pairs in the prepared zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts and the holes were mostly captured to induce oxidation 9 35 table s2 tabulates the band gaps of the resultant samples the evb and ecb potentials of tio2 zro2 and zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were shown in fig 7 their evb potentials were also higher than the standard oxidation potential of water furthermore the resultant photocatalysts were expected to directly form oh radical which responsible for photodegradation of organic pollutants in aqueous solution since the vb of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts straddled the redox potential of oh radical however based on the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts band gap alignment the organic pollutants could not be degraded by superoxide radical o2 since their cb position is less negative than o2 o2 reduction potential the half reaction for standard water reduction potential h h2 and water oxidation potential o2 h2o are shown in eqs 13 and 14 13 2h aq 2e h2 g 14 o2 g 4h aq 4e 2h2o l 3 5 adsorption and photocatalytic activity analysis since adsorption and photocatalysis occurred simultaneously during the oily wastewater degradation process the role of adsorption must be well understood to determine the actual photocatalytic activity efficiency 66 fig 8 a shows the oily wastewater adsorption capacity qe of tio2 and zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts the adsorption capacity represents the total amount of oily wastewater pollutant in mg that was adsorbed on per g of photocatalysts adsorbate the 1 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts prepared in this study revealed the highest qe around 61 mg g the 5 10 15 and 20 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts recorded values of 52 58 56 and 54 mg g respectively meanwhile tio2 recorded qe around 48 mg g the qe increased with zr content up to 1 before decreasing at 5 zr content the qe values increased again at 10 zr content before showing reducing trend until 20 zr content however all qe values of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were higher than the qe of tio2 the increase in surface area of these photocatalysts can be attributed to the increase in qe values the oily wastewater particles showed good adhesion onto zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts pure tio2 and zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were tested based on the photocatalytic degradation of oily wastewater as shown in fig 8 b in this study the 1 and 5 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts exhibited adsorption photodegradation of 95 and 94 respectively within 300 min for oily wastewater at 100 ppm the photocatalytic activity exhibited by the heterojunction photocatalysts supported the facts that co doping small quantity of zro2 into tio2 improved the transition of electron by reducing the e h recombination and generate more radicals that were crucial for redox processes the 1 and 5 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts outperformed other photocatalysts after irradiated under uv a light oily wastewater degradation rate showed improvement with co doping of zro2 into tio2 which indicated that the presence of zro2 had synergistically improved the photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 the outcome can be further explained by the generation of strong oxidants from the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts under uv irradiation that have consequently oxidized most of the hydrocarbon compounds with long carbon chain found in the oily wastewater zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts with 15 and 20 of zro2 content recorded toc degradation of 89 and 87 respectively 3 6 kinetics of photocatalytic reactions analysis the as synthesized photocatalysts tested using oily wastewater exhibited photocatalytic property which can be observed from the absorption intensity of the peak at 223 nm as shown in fig s4 that gradually decreased as the irradiation time increased indicating degradation of organic compounds in oily wastewater the results in fig 9 a are plotted in the form of eq 8 where straight lines passing through the origin fit of the experiment data precisely from the gradient of the resulting lines kapp values can be computed using the langmuir hinshelwood model as shown in fig 9 b the correlation coefficient of determination r2 for all as synthesized photocatalysts was close to 1 which demonstrated that the photodegradation of oily wastewater was well fitted by pseudo first order kinetics plot 46 based on the reaction conditions the rate constant values were between 40 10 4 min 1 and 15 10 4 min 1 the kapp value of 1 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts was 25 faster than the pure tio2 photocatalysts based on the obtained results obviously the degradation rate of pollutant was accelerated by adding small quantity of zro2 into tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts the results showed that the highest degradation rate was achieved at zr content of 1 it can be concluded that the interactions between zro2 and tio2 together with the formation of heterojunctions between these photocatalysts have significantly promoted the photocatalytic activity of this binary heterojunction photocatalysts however higher loading of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts decreases the generation rate of e h pairs and deteriorate the degradation of oily wastewater due to less active site 1 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts also showed the highest photodegradation rates with the shortest half life of 173 3 min this was followed by pure tio2 5 10 15 and 20 zro2 tio2 photocatalysts with 216 6 231 0 277 2 407 6 and 462 0 min respectively a longer half life period was observed with the increasing amount of zro2 1 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts recorded the highest kapp value which could be attributed to the presence of hydroxyl groups on the photocatalysts surface 34 and the formation of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts using sol gel approach can be further proven by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy analysis as shown in fig 10 analysis of the ftir spectra for zro2 tio2 samples revealed significant changes in the intensities of the relevant bands which depend on the mole content of the precursors the stretching of ti o and ti o ti bonds are usually present in the 400 800 cm 1 region however no peak around 800 cm 1 detected for ti o vibration the band observed at 1385 cm 1 was caused by the symmetric deformation band of a ch3 group from the isopropoxide structure 67 the peaks that appeared around 1620 and 3420 cm 1 were attributed to the strongly adsorbed oh groups and h2o respectively 68 the samples showed an increase in the intensity of the oh peaks when zro2 content was increased from 1 to 10 the decrease in the peak intensity was observed when the zro2 content was further increased to 15 and 20 in comparison with pristine tio2 the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts showed more intense oh peak this phenomenon is due to the presence of small amount of zro2 which has increased the concentration of active species such as surface hydroxyl groups this led to the formation of surface free radicals to enhance the photocatalytic degradation performance 3 7 post photocatalysis characterizations the sample after photocatalysis was examined to observe the changes of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts the xrd patterns illustrated in fig 11 a shows that the crystallinity reduced upon the photocatalytic reactions however all diffraction peaks corresponded to tio2 are still clearly visible which suggesting that the photocatalysts able to maintain its stability even after 3 cycles of operation from the ftir spectra as shown in fig 11 b two new peaks at around 2070 29 and 2529 58 cm 1 that associated with the co molecules adsorbed on rutile tio2 69 or single nanoparticle surface 70 were observed the peak at 1526 53 cm 1 and 3399 57 cm 1 at the beginning of the process shifted towards lower wave number of 1526 24 cm 1 and 3370 83 cm 1 upon photocatalytic reaction indicating a more stable chemical bond 71 meanwhile the emergence of peak at around 725 08 cm 1 was associated with the monoclinic peaks of zro2 72 due to the increased of zro2 stretching 73 as a result of reduction in the size and crystal quality of the nanoparticles 74 the shifting of peaks and appearance of new peaks confirmed the occurrence of the adsorption photocatalysis mechanism a slight increase in the intensity of the xps survey spectra was observed after photocatalysis as can be seen in fig 11 c the peaks for ti2p and o1s remained almost unchanged as in fig 11 d and e zr3d5 2 peak however shifted a bit to the left of the spectra at the binding energy of 183 5 ev as can be seen in fig 11 f the xps and xrd analysis had provided clear proof that heterojunctions have been constructed and stable during the photocatalytic reaction the textural data after adsorption and photocatalysis are summarized in table 2 the pore size radius increased after adsorption and photocatalysis however the radius pore size after adsorption recorded higher value than the pore size radius after photocatalysis both surface area and pore volume decreased as the pore size radius decreases mainly due to the aggregation of photocatalysts the morphology of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts after adsorption and photocatalysis is shown in fig 12 the estimated average size of the spherical nanoparticle after adsorption was measured from the fesem images shown in fig 12 a and was estimated as 36 91 2 79 nm the size of the spherical nanoparticle was close to the average value of the original zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts some of the nanoparticles lost their spherical identity due to the aggregation 75 however the spherical size increased to around 51 70 2 98 nm after photocatalysis as shown in fig 12 b tem image in fig 12 c also show the pristine zro2 tio2 particulates having spherical shape and tend to aggregate in aqueous phase meanwhile the recovered zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts as in fig 12 d showed some aggregation and clusters indicating that there was significant change in the particle size of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts after the photocatalytic reaction the weight percentage of the components in zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts before and after photocatalysis is tabulated in table 3 it was observed that ti atom was the major element with the weight percentage of ti after photocatalysis increased by 3 44 however the major spectral changed after photocatalysis was observed in zr element which increased by 75 following the nanoparticles aggregation which cause changed to the surface condition the significant decrease in the oxygen weight percentage might indicate the degradation of the compounds in oily wastewater 76 the absence of other elements in the edx spectrum shows that no impurities were found 3 8 regeneration study the regeneration of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were determined by using the same photocatalyst for 4 cycle testing fig 13 shows that the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalysts decreased slightly from 95 to 90 after three cycles and then became 81 at the fourth cycle based on the prescribed conditions the findings revealed that the prepared photocatalysts had sufficient stableness within three cycles similar number of cycles was reported by abdi et al 77 and the photocatalysts were considered stable as the findings of this study was found to be within same range as the study by azzam et al 50 3 9 comparison of oily wastewater degradation with literature the comparison for some tio2 based photocatalysts for oily wastewater treatment is summarized in table 4 based on the work performed by ong et al 47 the immobilized tio2 showed significant effect in the degradation of oily wastewater although the membrane flux tend to decrease at higher oil concentration meanwhile yuliwati and ismail 78 reported remarkable membrane performance in the treatment of refinery wastewater when immobilized with licl tio2 despite the pores are blocked by tio2 aggregates which decreased the average pore size liu et al 79 reported effective polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons degradation in distilled water with addition of tio2 but the photocatalysis enhancement was restricted in offshore produced water media shahrezaei et al 80 reported better photocatalytic degradation of petroleum refinery wastewater compared to microwave assisted catalytic wet air oxidation with addition of tio2 nanoparticles these comparisons suggested that tio2 based photocatalysts are applicable in the degradation of oily wastewater 4 conclusion zro2 tio2 heterojunction together with tio2 and zro2 photocatalysts were synthesized using sol gel method and followed by calcination treatment xrd patterns revealed that the anatase phase stabilized as zro2 was co doped into tio2 lattice and the peak intensities of tio2 anatase phase reduced as the zro2 mole content increased incorporation of zro2 into tio2 significantly enhanced the specific surface area and reduced band gap in comparison to energy band gap of zro2 which led to a better photocatalytic degradation 1 and 5 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts surpassed the performance of tio2 photocatalysts used in the photodegradation of oily wastewater the incorporation of small quantity of zro2 was able to boost the photocatalytic activity efficiency besides showing significant improvement in structural features such as the surface area and able to maintain the crystallinity intensity up to the 20 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts the 1 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts recorded the highest toc degradation compared to the other heterojunction photocatalysts higher zro2 mole content was detected as the main basis that delayed the separation efficiency of the e h pairs and disrupted the formation of surface radicals which descended the photocatalytic activity zro2 mole content selection play an important role to improve photocatalytic activity performance although the oily wastewater was not completely degraded the degradation potential proceeded mainly through free radical mechanism the photocatalysts prepared via co doping small amount of zro2 into tio2 using the sol gel method showed improved photocatalytic activity for oily wastewater degradation meanwhile co doping higher amount of zro2 can increase the surface area and reduce particle size but have low photocatalytic activity due to poor transfer of electrons from zro2 to tio2 following decreased in the number of photons absorbed as mentioned above the observed photocatalytic activity of oily wastewater follows the order of 1 zro2 tio2 5 zro2 tio2 10 zro2 tio2 tio2 15 zro2 tio2 20 zro2 tio2 these results showed that monoclinic phase of zro2 contributed to the improvement of photodegradation declaration of competing interest the authors

13689,in this work zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were successfully synthesized using sol gel method the effect of zro2 doped into tio2 on the retardation of the electron hole pairs were investigated the crystalline structure of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts was verified through x ray diffraction xrd patterns and the crystallite size were found smaller compared to tio2 and zro2 photocatalysts morphological characterization evidenced that the co doping of zro2 into tio2 has altered the particle size of tio2 and the shape of the synthesized particle through chemical nucleation and growth process in bulk solution the small crystallite size of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction recorded the highest surface area with higher incident in the mesopores volume as confirmed by brunauer emmett teller bet analysis the adsorption photodegradation performance of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts on oily wastewater as model pollutant enhanced with the incorporation of small amount of zro2 compared to tio2 the presence of surface adsorbed water peaks and hydroxyl groups as disclosed by fourier transform infrared ftir supported the finding of the study keywords zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts oily wastewater photodegradation photocatalytic activity 1 introduction oily wastewater is a complex substance which usually contains high concentrations of dispersed oil grease suspended particles 1 fats hydrocarbons as well as petroleum fractions such as diesel oil gasoline and kerosene 2 many industries such as petrochemical refineries oil distribution companies food producers and machining factories release a significant quantity of oil containing wastewater into water body 3 the oily wastewater has different undesirable impacts on the immediate environment such as atmosphere contamination caused by the vaporization of oil and hydrocarbon contents to the environment oily wastewater discharge without proper treatment can influence groundwater salt water or drinking water because of the percolation of contaminants in produced water into the water resources underneath the earth and create ecological problems 4 apart from that the frequent oil spill to seawater and its ecotoxicological effect threatens the marine and coastal ecosystems 5 diversities of treatment methods geared in the direction of oil impurities exclusion can be used to alleviate the undesirable effects of oily wastewaters 2 despite many approaches carried out to treat oily wastewater 4 9 most of them suffer from major drawbacks such as expensive maintenance lateness in separation time fouling high retention time and less efficient at higher feed concentration 10 some studies demonstrated the feasibility of using photocatalysis to treat oily wastewater owing to its environmentally friendliness and high oxidation efficiency 11 13 photocatalysis is an advanced oxidation process aop that able to completely mineralize contamination in both liquid and gas phase under ambient pressure and temperature 14 the ability of aop to generate powerful oxidizing agent makes it an effective technology 15 in photocatalysis the rate of chemical transformation is enhanced by the photocatalyst under light irradiation 16 photocatalysis also has immense potential to produce decontaminated water 17 promising results have been attained by photocatalysis for industrial wastewater treatment to remove a wide range of contaminants such as aromatics pesticides and pharmaceuticals as well as oil and grease 18 the exploration of titanium dioxide tio2 photocatalysts since 1972 19 has led to the widespread application of this effective semiconductor photocatalyst 20 for the removal of various pollutants 21 including organic pollutants photodegradation in both water and air 22 23 chemical stability remarkable oxidation ability 24 25 low cost non toxicity long term stability and photostability are the favourable characteristics which make tio2 the most promising photocatalysts to degrade pollutants and produce hydrogen 26 heterojunction photocatalysis using tio2 is by far the most studied oxidation process for the mineralization of pollutants into harmless products through the generation of electron hole e h pairs when the semiconductor is exposed to uv radiation 18 also the hydroxyl radicals oh produced by photocatalysis have high oxidizing power of 2 80 v 17 even though tio2 is renowned for its chemical and physical stability tio2 is prone to go through phase transformation from anatase to rutile 27 this phenomenon has a detrimental effect on tio2 since rutile phase is known to decrease the surface area of tio2 which reduces the photocatalytic performance 28 due to the recombination of e h pairs 29 however this shortcoming could be minimized through the introduction of second metal oxide such as la2o3 sio2 sno2 and zro2 introduction of metal oxide into tio2 was reported to induce significant degradation under uv irradiation 30 and can generate oxygen vacancies through the substitution of divalent or trivalent atoms by tetravalent atoms and give rise to particle particle interaction 31 in this study zro2 was introduced because it has been proven effective in suppressing the phase transformation of tio2 27 and increasing the surface area of photocatalysts owing to the stabilization of the active phase in a finely dispersed state 32 as a result zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts have been extensively studied by many researchers 33 38 the introduction of small quantity of zro2 into tio2 can improve the chemical stability and boost the photocatalytic activities of tio2 36 39 40 typical tio2 based heterojunction photocatalysts include conventional heterojunctions type i type ii and type iii p n heterojunctions and direct z scheme heterojunctions conventional heterojunctions consist of type i with straddling gap type ii with staggered gap and type iii with a broken gap 41 nowadays tio2 based heterojunction photocatalysts have attracted wide attention and utilized for various application this is due to the effectiveness of heterojunction photocatalysts in facilitating charge transfer and suppressing the recombination of photogenerated e h pairs which help to improve the photocatalytic performance 42 li et al 43 explored the potential of ticx sicx heterojunction semiconductor as anode material later gnanasekaran et al 44 reported the improvement in the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutant using the hybrid of fe3o4 and tio2 to the best of our knowledge the treatment of oily wastewaters using zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalyst that is based on metal doped semiconductor has not yet been reported in this study modified sol gel method was used to dope zro2 into tio2 to produce zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts with high surface area the incorporation of zro2 into tio2 is expected to promote the separation of e h pairs which reduce recombination 17 and the migration of surface oxygen species improve the photocatalytic activity 45 the characteristics of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts such as specific surface area pore size pore volume particle size crystal phase structure optical band gap surface morphology e h pairs transition elemental composition and functional groups were also determined the oily wastewater adsorption photodegradation performance estimated from total organic carbon toc degradation verified that the quality of the treated oily wastewater has met the regulatory standards 2 materials and experimental 2 1 chemicals and reagents

photocatalysts tio2 zro2 and zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were synthesized using sol gel method as described elsewhere 33 in which ttip and tpz were used as precursors for tio2 and zro2 respectively a typical procedure for the preparation of tio2 was carried out by mixing 10 ml of ttip with 90 ml of ipa the mixture was then added dropwise into 900 ml of d i water that was maintained at the ph of 1 5 using nitric acid by means of portable ph meter hq11d hach and the mixture was mechanically stirred using a magnetic stirrer at 700 rpm or until a single central vertical vortex was formed the reaction tub was filled up with crushed ice to keep the temperature approximately at 2 c during the mixing stage the mixture was stirred vigorously for 20 h at ambient temperature to obtain colloidal sol after the aging period of 24 h at room temperature the colloidal sol was precipitated through evaporative drying using hotplate until the colloidal sol was transformed into tio2 crystals the resulting photocatalysts were then dried in vacuum oven at 105 c for 4 h and later calcined at 500 c in furnace nabertherm gmbh with air flowing continuously for 3 h to remove the solvents 46 the dried photocatalysts were then ground and sieved into fine powder prior to testing the same experimental conditions were used to synthesize zro2 and zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts with different zro2 mole content loaded into tio2 and reported in this study as 1 5 10 15 20 50 and 80 zro2 tio2 the molarity ratio of ti and zr samples was 0 017 0 016 2 3 preparation of synthetic oily wastewater the oily wastewater was prepared by mixing nine parts of the pre mixed commercial cutting oil ridgid ridge tool company ohio usa with one part of sdbs in a high speed blender model bl 310aw khind within the surrounding environment at the speed 50 hz for about 2 min as described elsewhere 47 the desired amount of cutting oil and sdbs mixture were mixed with 1 l of d i water to prepare the synthetic oily wastewater with concentration of 100 ppm prior to the evaluation of photocatalytic activity the calibration curve of the oily wastewater was prepared the emulsion had maximum uv absorption at 223 nm wavelength perkin elmer uv vis spectrometer lambda 25 was utilized to measure the absorbance of oily wastewater at different concentration at 223 nm the related λmax did not change with oil concentration in the emulsion linear calibration curve with a coefficient of correlation r2 of 0 993 was obtained as shown in fig s1 2 4 characterization of photocatalysts the xrd patterns of the as prepared photocatalysts were acquired by rigaku d max rb 12 kw x ray diffractometer equipped with nickel filtered copper kα radiation λ 1 54056 å operated at 30 ma and 40 kv the surface area of the photocatalysts were calculated from bet plot using thermo scientific surfer analyzer and the pore size distribution was obtained using barrett joyner halenda bjh model derived from

optical band gap energy was estimated from kubelka munk function and tauc s plot the modified kubelka munk function with indirect allowed transitions n ½ was shown in eq 1 48 1 f r h v k h v e g 1 n where f r represent the kubelka munk function hv represent the photon energy k represents the energy independent constant and eg represent the optical band gap x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps spectra of the prepared sample was determined using shimadzhu axis ultradld with al kα radiation monochromatic source ftir spectra were recorded in perkin elmer spectrum system the photocatalysts were mixed with kbr and the ratio of photocatalysts to kbr was maintained as 1 100 the mixture was pressed under 10 tons cm 2 to produce a 300 mg pellet 2 5 adsorption studies the adsorption studies of oily wastewater onto zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were done to determine the adsorption capacity of the as synthesized samples 0 35 g of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were added in 350 ml of 100 ppm oily wastewater and continuously stirred at a speed of 350 rpm to ensure the homogeneity of the suspension contents at 25 c in dark condition the suspension was stirred in dark condition for 120 min to establish the adsorption desorption equilibrium 40 of oily wastewater on the photocatalysts as well as to ensure no photocatalysis occurred during this period during the reaction suspensions were collected with a syringe at timed intervals and filtered before the aliquot was analysed using uv vis and later using toc analyser the adsorbed amount of oily wastewater at equilibrium qe mg g was calculated by the following eq 2 2 q e c 0 c e v w the adsorption percentage and the adsorption capacity of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were calculated from eqs 3 and 4 respectively 3 a d s c 0 c t c 0 x 100 4 a d s o r p t i o n c a p a c i t y c 0 c t v w x 100 where co mg l is the initial concentrations of oily wastewater ce mg l is the equilibrium concentration of oily wastewater ct is the oily wastewater concentration at time t mg l v l is the volume of model pollutant solution and w g is the weight of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts used during adsorption experiments 49 2 6 photocatalytic activity evaluation after the adsorption desorption period the uv light was turned on and the photocatalytic activities were measured via photodegradation of oily wastewater in aqueous solution at atmospheric pressure and room temperature the suspension was irradiated using an 8 w black light blue uv a lamp with a maximum light intensity output at 365 nm fl8blb sankyo denki co ltd japan the uv light intensity was measured using a uvx radiometer with uv a sensor uvx 36 uvp inc upland ca the light distance was fixed at 1 cm from the prepared suspension 15 ml of aliquots were withdrawn from the suspension every 60 min within 300 min of uv irradiation to evaluate the apparent reaction rate constant and the photocatalysts were filtered using a ptfe membrane thermo scientific titan3 30 mm filter blue 0 2 μm before the supernatant was analysed using toc analyser eight supernatants were collected in total and continuously measured from the collection tube vial with single oct l unit and combusted at 720 2 c using the combustion catalytic oxidation method the oily wastewater degradation in aqueous

t respectively 2 7 regeneration study to investigate the stability of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts the reuse of the photocatalyst has been studied the entire photocatalytic stability test has been carried out under identical reaction conditions at the end of the uv irradiation the utilized photocatalysts were filtered and washed carefully with 50 ml of distilled water for 3 times then the washed photocatalysts were dried in a hot air oven at 105 c for 1 h to remove the water contained in the photocatalysts to be used in the subsequent run 2 8 kinetics of photocatalytic reactions the langmuir hinshelwood model as shown in eq 6 was employed to describe the kinetics of photocatalytic reactions of organic pollutants this model relates the reaction rate r mg l min with the reactant concentration c mg l 6 r d c d t k f k a d c 1 k a d c where kf is the reaction rate constant mg l min and kad is the adsorption constant l mg when the adsorption is relatively weak and or

d 3 results and discussion 3 1 crystallinity analysis fig 1 illustrates the xrd patterns of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts after calcined at 500 c in comparison with the tio2 and zro2 photocatalysts the position of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction peaks closely resembled the properties of tio2 with the characteristic diffraction peak of anatase tio2 at 2θ 25 3 1 0 1 37 8 0 0 4 48 0 2 0 0 53 8 1 0 5 and 55 0 2 1 1 the appreciably sharp peak with high intensity suggested that the tio2 consisted of bigger particles size the crystalline tio2 anatase phase has a tetragonal crystal system space group of i41 amd the lattice constants were closed to the mostly reported tio2 photocatalysts with band gap of 3 2 ev 50 calcination of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts resulted in the crystal deformation of interstratified structure among metal oxide units 51 the broad peaks with a large full width half maximum fwhm indicated that the as synthesized photocatalysts were governed by the crystalline structure of anatase tio2 this also suggested that the crystallinity of the primary peak tio2 was well conserved during the co doping of zro2 however the crystallinity of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts decreased with the increasing zro2 content as measured by the reference intensity ratio rir clearly co doping small quantity of zro2 as little as 1 into tio2 affected the crystallinity of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts through anatase phase stabilization which was more favourable for photocatalytic applications 52 the tetragonal zro2 phase was successfully suppressed the tio2 pattern was observed to be intense in the 1 zro2 tio2 formulation because tio2 diffracts more efficiently compared to zro2 in this composition with at least four peaks matched the principal diffraction peaks of tio2 peaks of anatase rutile and brookite were all present addition of zro2 did not affect any structural properties co doping of zro2 from 5 to 20 revealed only anatase tio2 and monoclinic zro2 phases however cubic peaks started to appear at 50 zro2 tio2 the increase in fwhm along with the decrease in peak intensity implied that zro2 doped into tio2 lattice has resulted in the lowering of crystallite size of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts as summarized in table s1 the reduction in the average crystallite size as measured at peak 1 0 1 around 5 12 nm suggested that the anatase phase is stable dauksta et al 52 mentioned that anatase phased nanoparticles are highly stable with the size of less than 14 nm the smaller crystallite size resulted in higher surface to volume ratio which helped to enhance the photocatalytic activity 53 the baddeleyite zro2 monoclinic crystals dominated the primary phase when the zro2 was further increase to 80 wt also all characteristic peaks indexing to the counterparts did not show any shifts at zro2 quantity of 1 20 wt which ascertain the prosperous coupling of these nanoparticles to construct the heterojunction photocatalysts 3 2 textural analysis according to iupac classification the physisorption isotherm of the photocatalysts were classified as type iv and having a distinctive h1 hysteresis loop which indicated mesoporous materials as shown in fig 2 a with all zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts exhibited higher specific surface area compared to tio2 the specific surface area increased about 242 from 39 928 m2 g to 136 671 m2 g when 1 zro2 was doped into tio2 co doping of zro2 into tio2 increased the specific surface area due to rise in mesopore volume as the result of inhibition of tio2 crystal growth 54 and due to the fine dispersion of zro2 particles on the surface of tio2 55 the specific surface area reduced by 17 113 919 m2 g for the 5 zro2 tio2 which may be due to the settling of zro2 particles in the pores of tio2 56 the specific surface area gradually increased to 129 414 and 131 741 m2 g for the 10 and 15 zro2 tio2 respectively the 20 zro2 tio2 recorded the highest specific surface area of 144 492 m2 g there was no clear trend with the changes in the specific surface area as have been expected the radius pore size decreased as the specific surface area increased it was also noticeable that the total pore volume increased with higher mesopores volume recorded over micropores volume 1 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts showed significant improvement in pore volume compared to pure tio2 which suggested that co doping of zro2 into tio2 lead towards photocatalysts with higher porosity and desirable for photocatalytic activity 57 meanwhile the pore size distribution showed a higher incidence of mesopores in the range of 2 to 4 nm for tio2 fig 2 b and 4 7 nm for zro2 fig 2 c all zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts and tio2 recorded similar pore size distribution value such observation suggested that the structural properties of the mesopores were well maintained with only small changes fig 2 d h the textural properties of the as synthesized photocatalysts are tabulated in table 1 co doping a small quantity of zro2 into tio2 would increase the specific surface area of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts which helped to provide more reaction site for redox processes to occur 58 3 3 surface morphological and elemental composition analysis the morphological images of the tio2 and zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts obtained from fesem is shown in fig 3 tio2 photocatalysts fig 3 a has a clear spherical shape nanoparticle when zro2 phase was doped into tio2 the photocatalysts exhibited smaller spherical size of nanoparticles with increased co doping of zro2 from 1 to 20 the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts revealed the uniform dispersion of zro2 on the surface of tio2 with small agglomeration observed zro2 were densely deposited onto the surface of tio2 due to interfacial interactions and preferential heterogeneous nucleation fig 3 b f the formation of the heterojunction photocatalysts were originated through direct deposition of heterogeneous nucleation and growth of zro2 into tio2 throughout the synthesis course 59 the different shapes resulted through co doping of zro2 into tio2 exhibited greater active surfaces with respect to spherical nanoparticles 60 and increased the photocatalytic performance fig 4 shows the tem images of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts the average grain size of the heterojunction photocatalysts is around 12 nm the fringe spacing of 0 352 nm matched the 1 0 1 plane of anatase tio2 while the fringe spacing of 0 368 nm matched the 0 1 1 plane of monoclinic zro2 the edx spectrum shown in fig 5 confirmed the presence of chemical constituents in zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts the signals of ti zr and o elements were detected at their respective energy levels this further evidence that the zro2 has been successfully coupled with tio2 to form a heterojunction photocatalysts the signals represent the presence of au was resulted from the gold used for sputtering it was also noticed that the elements were uniformly distributed throughout the sample 3 4 optical analysis fig s2 a and b showed the estimated optical band gap energy of tio2 zro2 and zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts with zro2 mole percent of 1 5 10 15 and 20 according to the results the band gap energy values of tio2 and zro2 were 3 10 and 5 10 ev respectively the optical band gap energy of 1 and 5 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were slightly lower than that of tio2 with 2 97 and 3 07 ev respectively the decrease in band gap was due to the increase in oxygen vacancies that helped to delocalize the impurity states that overlapped with the edge of valence band hence resulted in the photocatalyst with lower energy band gap 61 reduction in optical band gap energy had realized the heterojunction photocatalysts practicalities that allowed better absorption of photons to excite the electrons in the valence band vb however as the zro2 doped into tio2 increased to 10 15 and 20 the heterojunction photocatalysts exhibited increased optical band gap energy of 3 17 3 18 and 3 24 ev respectively due to the wider band gap of zro2 increased in optical band gap energy decreased the number of photons that the photocatalysts can absorb 62 the fluorescence emission spectra of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts are shown in fig s3 a and b the extinction of the fluorescence intensity at excitation source of 233 nm exhibited the following order zro2 tio2 20 zro2 tio2 10 zro2 tio2 5 zro2 tio2 15 zro2 tio2 1 zro2 tio2 co doping small zro2 content into tio2 lowered the e h recombination rates due to the formation of surface trap site and lattice defects which helped extend the lifetime of electrons on the conduction band cb increased metal doping concentrations resulted in the increase of fluorescence intensity this indicated faster recombination rate that might be due to the inefficient diffusion of zr into tio2 lattice as describe elsewhere 35 in the heterojunction photocatalyst the zr4 ions were surrounded by o ti bonds forming a zr o ti bonding structure in the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts as shown in fig 6 a of xps spectra the peak of ti2p could be fitted with two peaks at binding energies of 465 04 ev and 459 45 ev fig 6 b assigned to ti2p1 2 and ti2p3 2 of ti4 chemical state ti o bond respectively these two peaks were corresponded to ti iv in anatase tio2 63 a significant difference between the two binding energies was around 5 59 ev indicating that titanium existed as ti4 chemical state in the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts the peak of o1s could also be fitted with two peaks at binding energies of 532 72 ev and 530 69 ev fig 6 c which ascribed to oh and o2 respectively this confirmed the existence of surface hydroxyl groups in the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts at least three signals were observed from the peaks of binding energy for zr3d of xps spectra fig 6 d the peaks at 182 ev and 185 ev can be attributed to the zr3d3 2 and zr3d5 2 in zro2 tio2 domain respectively which was affected by the o ti chemical bonds in zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts the peaks at 182 6 ev and 185 2 ev were ascribed to the zr3d3 2 and zr3d5 2 in zro2 domain respectively the successful incorporation formation mechanism of heterogeneous zro2 into tio2 to form hybridized zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts could be that zro2 partly dispersed in tio2 material hybridized with tio2 on its boundary gradually a mixed of zro2 tio2 phase was formed and hetero condensation between zirconia and titania yield the zroti bonding structure similar findings were reported elsewhere 46 the effect of zro2 doping on the band gap structure was further elucidated by obtaining the band gap edges position to better classify the as prepared zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts as a prospective photocatalyst for oily wastewater treatment the vb and cb edge positions of the photocatalysts were calculated according to the mulliken electronegativity theory herein the electronegativity of an atom is the arithmetic mean of the atomic electron affinity and the first ionisation energy 64 the vb and cb positions were determined by using the following reactions 11 e v b x e e 0 5 e g 12 e c b e v b e g where ecb and evb are the bottom cb and the top vb relative to the normal hydrogen electrode nhe and eg means the band gap energy ee is the energy of free electrons 4 5 ev x is the electronegativity of the semiconductor in this study the eg of tio2 and zro2 was estimated as 3 1 and 5 1 respectively as shown in fig s2 a and b the x value of 5 81 ev was used in eq 9 to determine the evb for tio2 and all zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts for zro2 the x value of 5 91 ev was used 38 based on the band gap positions the cb and vb edge potentials of zro2 were determined at 1 14 ev and 3 96 ev respectively meanwhile the cb and vb edge potentials of tio2 were calculated as 0 24 ev and 2 86 ev respectively the transition of electrons from the vb of zro2 and tio2 to cb occurred under uv irradiation and the same number of holes were left in the corresponding vb position in comparison to the ecb value of tio2 the ecb value of zro2 was more negative hence the electrons moved from the cb of zro2 to the cb of tio2 and promote charge separation at the heterojunction interface meanwhile the holes migrated from vb of zro2 to vb of tio2 similar observation was reported elsewhere 65 this finding suggested that charge separation enhancement occurred between electrons and holes which suppressed the e h pairs in the prepared zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts and the holes were mostly captured to induce oxidation 9 35 table s2 tabulates the band gaps of the resultant samples the evb and ecb potentials of tio2 zro2 and zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were shown in fig 7 their evb potentials were also higher than the standard oxidation potential of water furthermore the resultant photocatalysts were expected to directly form oh radical which responsible for photodegradation of organic pollutants in aqueous solution since the vb of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts straddled the redox potential of oh radical however based on the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts band gap alignment the organic pollutants could not be degraded by superoxide radical o2 since their cb position is less negative than o2 o2 reduction potential the half reaction for standard water reduction potential h h2 and water oxidation potential o2 h2o are shown in eqs 13 and 14 13 2h aq 2e h2 g 14 o2 g 4h aq 4e 2h2o l 3 5 adsorption and photocatalytic activity analysis since adsorption and photocatalysis occurred simultaneously during the oily wastewater degradation process the role of adsorption must be well understood to determine the actual photocatalytic activity efficiency 66 fig 8 a shows the oily wastewater adsorption capacity qe of tio2 and zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts the adsorption capacity represents the total amount of oily wastewater pollutant in mg that was adsorbed on per g of photocatalysts adsorbate the 1 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts prepared in this study revealed the highest qe around 61 mg g the 5 10 15 and 20 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts recorded values of 52 58 56 and 54 mg g respectively meanwhile tio2 recorded qe around 48 mg g the qe increased with zr content up to 1 before decreasing at 5 zr content the qe values increased again at 10 zr content before showing reducing trend until 20 zr content however all qe values of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were higher than the qe of tio2 the increase in surface area of these photocatalysts can be attributed to the increase in qe values the oily wastewater particles showed good adhesion onto zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts pure tio2 and zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were tested based on the photocatalytic degradation of oily wastewater as shown in fig 8 b in this study the 1 and 5 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts exhibited adsorption photodegradation of 95 and 94 respectively within 300 min for oily wastewater at 100 ppm the photocatalytic activity exhibited by the heterojunction photocatalysts supported the facts that co doping small quantity of zro2 into tio2 improved the transition of electron by reducing the e h recombination and generate more radicals that were crucial for redox processes the 1 and 5 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts outperformed other photocatalysts after irradiated under uv a light oily wastewater degradation rate showed improvement with co doping of zro2 into tio2 which indicated that the presence of zro2 had synergistically improved the photocatalytic efficiency of tio2 the outcome can be further explained by the generation of strong oxidants from the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts under uv irradiation that have consequently oxidized most of the hydrocarbon compounds with long carbon chain found in the oily wastewater zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts with 15 and 20 of zro2 content recorded toc degradation of 89 and 87 respectively 3 6 kinetics of photocatalytic reactions analysis the as synthesized photocatalysts tested using oily wastewater exhibited photocatalytic property which can be observed from the absorption intensity of the peak at 223 nm as shown in fig s4 that gradually decreased as the irradiation time increased indicating degradation of organic compounds in oily wastewater the results in fig 9 a are plotted in the form of eq 8 where straight lines passing through the origin fit of the experiment data precisely from the gradient of the resulting lines kapp values can be computed using the langmuir hinshelwood model as shown in fig 9 b the correlation coefficient of determination r2 for all as synthesized photocatalysts was close to 1 which demonstrated that the photodegradation of oily wastewater was well fitted by pseudo first order kinetics plot 46 based on the reaction conditions the rate constant values were between 40 10 4 min 1 and 15 10 4 min 1 the kapp value of 1 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts was 25 faster than the pure tio2 photocatalysts based on the obtained results obviously the degradation rate of pollutant was accelerated by adding small quantity of zro2 into tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts the results showed that the highest degradation rate was achieved at zr content of 1 it can be concluded that the interactions between zro2 and tio2 together with the formation of heterojunctions between these photocatalysts have significantly promoted the photocatalytic activity of this binary heterojunction photocatalysts however higher loading of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts decreases the generation rate of e h pairs and deteriorate the degradation of oily wastewater due to less active site 1 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts also showed the highest photodegradation rates with the shortest half life of 173 3 min this was followed by pure tio2 5 10 15 and 20 zro2 tio2 photocatalysts with 216 6 231 0 277 2 407 6 and 462 0 min respectively a longer half life period was observed with the increasing amount of zro2 1 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts recorded the highest kapp value which could be attributed to the presence of hydroxyl groups on the photocatalysts surface 34 and the formation of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts using sol gel approach can be further proven by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy analysis as shown in fig 10 analysis of the ftir spectra for zro2 tio2 samples revealed significant changes in the intensities of the relevant bands which depend on the mole content of the precursors the stretching of ti o and ti o ti bonds are usually present in the 400 800 cm 1 region however no peak around 800 cm 1 detected for ti o vibration the band observed at 1385 cm 1 was caused by the symmetric deformation band of a ch3 group from the isopropoxide structure 67 the peaks that appeared around 1620 and 3420 cm 1 were attributed to the strongly adsorbed oh groups and h2o respectively 68 the samples showed an increase in the intensity of the oh peaks when zro2 content was increased from 1 to 10 the decrease in the peak intensity was observed when the zro2 content was further increased to 15 and 20 in comparison with pristine tio2 the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts showed more intense oh peak this phenomenon is due to the presence of small amount of zro2 which has increased the concentration of active species such as surface hydroxyl groups this led to the formation of surface free radicals to enhance the photocatalytic degradation performance 3 7 post photocatalysis characterizations the sample after photocatalysis was examined to observe the changes of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts the xrd patterns illustrated in fig 11 a shows that the crystallinity reduced upon the photocatalytic reactions however all diffraction peaks corresponded to tio2 are still clearly visible which suggesting that the photocatalysts able to maintain its stability even after 3 cycles of operation from the ftir spectra as shown in fig 11 b two new peaks at around 2070 29 and 2529 58 cm 1 that associated with the co molecules adsorbed on rutile tio2 69 or single nanoparticle surface 70 were observed the peak at 1526 53 cm 1 and 3399 57 cm 1 at the beginning of the process shifted towards lower wave number of 1526 24 cm 1 and 3370 83 cm 1 upon photocatalytic reaction indicating a more stable chemical bond 71 meanwhile the emergence of peak at around 725 08 cm 1 was associated with the monoclinic peaks of zro2 72 due to the increased of zro2 stretching 73 as a result of reduction in the size and crystal quality of the nanoparticles 74 the shifting of peaks and appearance of new peaks confirmed the occurrence of the adsorption photocatalysis mechanism a slight increase in the intensity of the xps survey spectra was observed after photocatalysis as can be seen in fig 11 c the peaks for ti2p and o1s remained almost unchanged as in fig 11 d and e zr3d5 2 peak however shifted a bit to the left of the spectra at the binding energy of 183 5 ev as can be seen in fig 11 f the xps and xrd analysis had provided clear proof that heterojunctions have been constructed and stable during the photocatalytic reaction the textural data after adsorption and photocatalysis are summarized in table 2 the pore size radius increased after adsorption and photocatalysis however the radius pore size after adsorption recorded higher value than the pore size radius after photocatalysis both surface area and pore volume decreased as the pore size radius decreases mainly due to the aggregation of photocatalysts the morphology of zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts after adsorption and photocatalysis is shown in fig 12 the estimated average size of the spherical nanoparticle after adsorption was measured from the fesem images shown in fig 12 a and was estimated as 36 91 2 79 nm the size of the spherical nanoparticle was close to the average value of the original zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts some of the nanoparticles lost their spherical identity due to the aggregation 75 however the spherical size increased to around 51 70 2 98 nm after photocatalysis as shown in fig 12 b tem image in fig 12 c also show the pristine zro2 tio2 particulates having spherical shape and tend to aggregate in aqueous phase meanwhile the recovered zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts as in fig 12 d showed some aggregation and clusters indicating that there was significant change in the particle size of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts after the photocatalytic reaction the weight percentage of the components in zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts before and after photocatalysis is tabulated in table 3 it was observed that ti atom was the major element with the weight percentage of ti after photocatalysis increased by 3 44 however the major spectral changed after photocatalysis was observed in zr element which increased by 75 following the nanoparticles aggregation which cause changed to the surface condition the significant decrease in the oxygen weight percentage might indicate the degradation of the compounds in oily wastewater 76 the absence of other elements in the edx spectrum shows that no impurities were found 3 8 regeneration study the regeneration of the zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts were determined by using the same photocatalyst for 4 cycle testing fig 13 shows that the photocatalytic activity of the photocatalysts decreased slightly from 95 to 90 after three cycles and then became 81 at the fourth cycle based on the prescribed conditions the findings revealed that the prepared photocatalysts had sufficient stableness within three cycles similar number of cycles was reported by abdi et al 77 and the photocatalysts were considered stable as the findings of this study was found to be within same range as the study by azzam et al 50 3 9 comparison of oily wastewater degradation with literature the comparison for some tio2 based photocatalysts for oily wastewater treatment is summarized in table 4 based on the work performed by ong et al 47 the immobilized tio2 showed significant effect in the degradation of oily wastewater although the membrane flux tend to decrease at higher oil concentration meanwhile yuliwati and ismail 78 reported remarkable membrane performance in the treatment of refinery wastewater when immobilized with licl tio2 despite the pores are blocked by tio2 aggregates which decreased the average pore size liu et al 79 reported effective polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons degradation in distilled water with addition of tio2 but the photocatalysis enhancement was restricted in offshore produced water media shahrezaei et al 80 reported better photocatalytic degradation of petroleum refinery wastewater compared to microwave assisted catalytic wet air oxidation with addition of tio2 nanoparticles these comparisons suggested that tio2 based photocatalysts are applicable in the degradation of oily wastewater 4 conclusion zro2 tio2 heterojunction together with tio2 and zro2 photocatalysts were synthesized using sol gel method and followed by calcination treatment xrd patterns revealed that the anatase phase stabilized as zro2 was co doped into tio2 lattice and the peak intensities of tio2 anatase phase reduced as the zro2 mole content increased incorporation of zro2 into tio2 significantly enhanced the specific surface area and reduced band gap in comparison to energy band gap of zro2 which led to a better photocatalytic degradation 1 and 5 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts surpassed the performance of tio2 photocatalysts used in the photodegradation of oily wastewater the incorporation of small quantity of zro2 was able to boost the photocatalytic activity efficiency besides showing significant improvement in structural features such as the surface area and able to maintain the crystallinity intensity up to the 20 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts the 1 zro2 tio2 heterojunction photocatalysts recorded the highest toc degradation compared to the other heterojunction photocatalysts higher zro2 mole content was detected as the main basis that delayed the separation efficiency of the e h pairs and disrupted the formation of surface radicals which descended the photocatalytic activity zro2 mole content selection play an important role to improve photocatalytic activity performance although the oily wastewater was not completely degraded the degradation potential proceeded mainly through free radical mechanism the photocatalysts prepared via co doping small amount of zro2 into tio2 using the sol gel method showed improved photocatalytic activity for oily wastewater degradation meanwhile co doping higher amount of zro2 can increase the surface area and reduce particle size but have low photocatalytic activity due to poor transfer of electrons from zro2 to tio2 following decreased in the number of photons absorbed as mentioned above the observed photocatalytic activity of oily wastewater follows the order of 1 zro2 tio2 5 zro2 tio2 10 zro2 tio2 tio2 15 zro2 tio2 20 zro2 tio2 these results showed that monoclinic phase of zro2 contributed to the improvement of photodegradation declaration of competing interest the authors
