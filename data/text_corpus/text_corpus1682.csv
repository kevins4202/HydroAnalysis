and jurassic sandstone hosted uranium deposits of the grants ambrosia lake uranium district in new mexico were the sites of numerous uranium mines and associated milling facilities quaternary deposits adjacent to these uranium bearing bedrock units host an alluvial groundwater system of varying water quality and quantity the relationship between the mineralogy of the quaternary deposits and groundwater quality was investigated near the grp site a former uranium mill the homestake mill in the center of the lower san mateo creek basin hereafter referred to as the lower basin fig 1 the homestake mill operated from 1958 to 1990 under a license from the nuclear regulatory commission nrc and since 1977 active groundwater remediation was initiated to address constituents released from a tailing impoundment investigation work throughout this time has primarily focused on delineating the areas of the alluvial aquifer affected by milling the study presented here was designed to define processes that dictate water quality identify sources of constituents to groundwater and establish the technical basis for groundwater restoration at the former uranium mill the united states environmental protection agency usepa initiated a field investigation in 2016 to further evaluate groundwater quality upgradient of the mill harte et al 2019 blake et al 2017 the study builds upon the work completed by the usepa and their collaborators at the united states geological survey usgs 1 1 uranium selenium molybdenum and vanadium geochemistry in roll front deposits during the formation of continental crust uranium selenium molybdenum and vanadium undergo a series of fractionation events resulting in highly variable concentrations in different rock types uranium exhibits dynamic chemical behavior readily transforming between dissolved and solid forms leading to significant migration and redistribution in geologic systems uranium can be leached from host mineral phases to surface water and or groundwater through a variety of processes but most commonly through exposure to carbonate rich waters generated through carbonate mineral dissolution langmuir 1978 redeposition of uranium occurs in sandstones and other porous host materials in association with geochemically reducing groundwaters or reduced materials the precipitation of uranium at this redox front forms what is referred to as a roll front deposit pyrite and organic matter are integral parts of sandstone strata bound uranium ore and roll front deposits such as in the grants mineral belt providing the reducing power to precipitate uraninite uo2 in the sandstone host brookins 1982 granger and warren 1974 spirakis 1996 plant et al 1999 at the redox interface mackinawite fes pyrite fes2 siderite feco3 iron oxyhydroxide minerals and elemental selenium se0 are frequently encountered granger and warren 1974 within the basin the sequence of this mineralization is understood to be selenium first or with pyrite uranium and vanadium concurrently and molybdenum last brookins 1982 frequently concurrently with the reduction and precipitation of clay or clay like minerals brookins 1990 other trace metals metalloids are nonuniformly distributed through the grants mineral belt reduced phase selenium is present in both ore bearing and barren sandstone as ferroselite within the poison canyon unit in the brushy basin member of the morrison fm cannon 1953 uranium selenites seleniferous pyrite and elemental selenium brookins 1982 have been shown to be present in high concentrations in these redox interface environments finch and murakami 1999 molybdenum is commonly present in roll front deposits as jordisite mos2 and as reduced molybdenum mo iv in pyrite brookins 1982 uranium molybdates are also present in ore grade material with molybdenum present as mo vi and uranium of mixed valence as u iv and u vi mixed valence uranium molybdates form primarily where uraninite and molybdenum bearing minerals are undergoing weathering and oxidation finch and murakami 1999 vanadium has been shown to occur in clays in the grants mineral belt as reduced v iv or v iii and is frequently associated with uranium ore only by severe alteration can vanadium be released as oxidized v v from the clay mineral structure brookins 1982 ambrosia lake uranium ore can contain up to 3 2 vanadium oxide lee 1976 and vanadium is considered a pathfinder element for uranium ore in this region brookins 1982 uranyl vanadates are important uranium ores in the colorado plateau and form where reduced uranium minerals e g uraninite and reduced vanadium minerals e g montroseite undergo oxidation the resultant minerals such as carnotite k2 uo2 2 v2o8 h2o 3 are very stable finch and murakami 1999 the weathering of uranium bearing vanadates molybdates and selenates in alluvial sediments can result in the release of these elements into the groundwater system alkalinity plays a large role in the dissolution and persistence of uranium in groundwater systems 1 2 regional natural sources of u se and v of the numerous uranium bearing geologic units present in the grants ambrosia lake uranium district several of important economic interest crop out in the basin notably as weathered bluffs surrounding the lower basin fig 2 the majority of the uranium bearing units in the region occur in north northeast dipping jurassic and cretaceous units including the jurassic todilto limestone morrison fm recapture westwater canyon and brushy basin members and the cretaceous dakota sandstone and mancos shale the primary uranium deposits in the morrison fm were formed through deposition at a groundwater geochemical interface with no consensus on the exact origin although deposition with humates and other organic material or deposition at a brine groundwater interface are common origin theories mclemore 2010 after formation of the primary sandstone uranium deposits oxidizing groundwaters remobilized some of the primary deposits and redistributed uranium at a redox interface roll front deposit where oxidized waters could not access remnant primary sandstone uranium deposits remained mclemore 2010 penecontemporaneously formed uranium vanadium assemblages are abundant in the deposits brookins 1982 mclemore 2010 in addition uranium is complexed and sorbed onto clay minerals within the mineral belt brookins 1979 uranium deposition and resultant concentrations in the sandstones are highly variable the morrison fm crops out approximately 5 miles to the north and hydrogeologically upgradient of the site investigated in this work weathering of these units over geologic time estimated as hundreds of years for the shallowest alluvial sediments to thousands or tens of thousands of years for the deeper sediments leopold and snyder 1951 along with weathering of the dakota sandstone has deposited sediments in the alluvial basin upgradient and throughout the site mclemore 2010 unoxidized mineral assemblages in the grants mineral belt include smectites illites and authigenic chlorites in association with pyrite and organic rich calcite cemented sandstones granger 1963 the authigenic chlorites are often vanadiferous and form alongside coffinite and uraninite brookins 1982 indicating that uranium s association with vanadium and authigenic clays is due to co genesis oxidized mineral assemblages are characterized by kaolinite with detrital chlorite and re worked smectites that co occur with ferric oxyhydroxide bearing organic carbon free sulfate carbonate cemented sandstone brookins 1990 in the grants region the todilto limestone consists of thin to thick bedded limestone with basal platy deposits of uranium heinrich 1958 associated with fractures containing geochemically reducing organic matter mclemore 2010 uranium is primarily present in the form of uraninite or less commonly as uraniferous fluorite heinrich 1958 but is rare to absent in near the todilto limestone gypsum anhydrite beds lovering 1956 hilpert 1969 other mineral components of the todilto limestone include pyrite barite calcite and fluorite with secondary uranium vanadium minerals carnotite and tyuyamunite heinrich 1958 the recapture member of the morrison fm consists of alternating fluvially deposited mudstones and sandstones freeman and hilpert 1956 thaden et al 1967 santos 1970 with lenses of westwater canyon member sandstone in upper sections cather 2011 the recapture member in the lower basin has not been shown to contain the same levels of uranium and vanadium minerals as other reaches of the unit mclemore 2007 but does consistently contain significant selenium beath et al 1940 the westwater canyon member of the morrison fm consists of fluvially deposited arkosic sandstones with angular grains of unaltered feldspar freeman and hilpert 1956 santos 1970 pierson and green 1977 with clay cement heinrich 1958 and interbedded mudstones freeman and hilpert 1956 santos 1970 pierson and green 1977 asphaltite and calcite have replaced clay cement between sand grains and the organic rich asphaltite served as a precipitant for uranium heinrich 1958 the ore is predominantly coffinite dispersed in pyrite and asphaltite and in some places contains uranium vanadium mineral tyuyamunite meunier 1994 clays are primarily montmorillonite and kaolinite freeman and hilpert 1956 santos 1970 with some illite brookins 1990 due to its consistently high uranium content the westwater canyon member is one of the most mined units in the region mclemore 2010 the high potassium feldspar content in this unit is an identifying characteristic distinguishing the westwater canyon and brushy basin members from other geologic units in the region freeman and hilpert 1956 the brushy basin member of the morrison fm consists of fluvially deposited claystone with some interbedded and otherwise massive semi arkosic sandstone that contains uranium of economic value heinrich 1958 clays are primarily montmorillonite and mixed layer chlorite montmorillonite santos 1970 brookins 1982 this unit contains the poison canyon sandstone which crops out in poison canyon 5 miles north of the grp site which contains ore characterized by a uranium vanadium ratio of 0 5 1 plus coffinite pyrite galena pbs metatyuyamunite calcium uranium vanadate autunite uranium phosphate gypsum kaolinite calcite and asphaltite heinrich 1958 in the poison canyon mine uraninite has been documented granger 1963 clay in the poison canyon unit is dominated by kaolinite and is virtually absent of illite brookins 1990 poison canyon s high uranium and very high selenium content heinrich 1958 brookins 1982 chenoweth and holen 1980 mclemore 2010 have made it a target for mining and have provided a source of uranium and selenium to groundwater gallaher and cary 1986 the dakota sandstone is a fine to medium grained quartz sandstone that generally contains no feldspar maxwell 1982 uranium is present in tabular masses associated with carbonaceous shales or lignite granger 1963 or in fractures in contact with the underlying brushy basin member of the morrison fm mclemore 2007 the mancos shale currently only crops out in the upper basin and in limited extent on the eastern bluffs leading up to mount taylor located 8 miles to the northeast the mancos shale consists of sandstones with thick interbeds of gray shale thaden et al 1967 the extent that the mancos shale contributed to the alluvial fill of the lower basin is unknown the deepest units that crop out in the valley are the triassic chinle fm with low uranium concentrations which forms the shale and sandstone bedrock beneath the alluvial fill of the lower basin and the triassic wingate sandstone which consists of white quartz eolian sandstone and siltstone that crops out at the base of the bluffs surrounding the valley other units that lack significant uranium content include the jurassic entrada sandstone eolian quartz sandstone siltstone summerville fm clean white quartz sandstone and the bluff sandstone clean quartz eolian sandstone none of the units from the chinle fm to the mancos shale have been noted to contain appreciable feldspar except the morrison fm westwater canyon and brushy basin members and small amounts in the dakota sandstone 1 3 sorption and solubility of uranium and other roll front geochemical markers uranium s association with reduced phases such as pyrite mackinawite siderite and organic carbon makes it susceptible to release through reaction with oxidants such as dissolved oxygen in groundwater release as u vi may be followed immediately by sorption onto oxidized iron minerals e g ferrihydrite or goethite dodge et al 2002 dissolution of this surface bound uranium is dependent on displacement through surface chemical reactions uranium can be stored in reduced minerals sorbed to oxidation products and dissolved through surface desorption reactions leading to the slow release of uranium from minerals to groundwater the rate of desorption of uranium from mineral surfaces varies based on geochemical parameters such as carbonate concentration ph and total dissolved solids tds liu et al 2009 used a multi rate surface complexation model to simulate desorption kinetics and found that greater desorption occurs in the presence of higher tds and carbonate higher alkalinity and ph negatively influence uranium sorption through the formation of uranium carbonate complexes e g highly soluble uo2co3 uo2 co3 2 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 langmuir 1978 solubility is enhanced further in the presence of calcium due to the formation of calcium uranium carbonate complexes these complexes are even more stable in the aqueous phase than uranium carbonate complexes stewart et al 2010 once formed each of these complexes increases the mobility of dissolved uranium by limiting uranium sorption to mineral surfaces attenuation vanadium molybdenum and selenium are also affected by redox conditions and are generally more mobile under oxidizing conditions vanadium has the lowest solubility of these constituents with soluble species dominated by v v as h2vo4 or hvo4 2 lower valence states such as v iv and v iii tend to be more strongly associated with oxides and have lower solubility wright et al 2014 molybdenum primarily as moo4 2 attenuates through sorption and precipitation under reducing conditions smedley and kinniburgh 2017 selenium is released to groundwater primarily through dissolution as selenate seo4 2 as has been documented in the mancos shale where it is liberated from sodium selenate salts and selenium containing gypsum mast et al 2014 1 4 uranium milling and impacts to groundwater by the homestake and bluewater mills the grants ambrosia lake uranium mining district in northwestern new mexico produced more uranium than any other mining district in the united states between 1951 and 1980 and continues to be an area of exploration and plans for development mclemore 2007 the grants district is located within the colorado plateau an area of approximately 150 000 square miles exposing the cretaceous and jurassic strata and an abundance of economically viable mineral deposits including uranium and vanadium as well as copper silver gypsum coal and oil shale heinrich 1958 mining of uranium deposits in the district began in earnest with the start of the u s atomic energy commission s domestic uranium program in 1948 uranium ore from ambrosia lake was milled at four facilities two are located at the southern terminus of the basin the anaconda bluewater mill and the homestake mill the bluewater mill located west of the grp was built in 1953 to process ore from the todilto limestone carbonate leach and jackpile mine acid leach mclemore 2010 and closed in 1982 mclemore 2007 the mill was transferred from the atlantic richfield company arco to the u s department of energy office of legacy management in 1997 u s department of energy usdoe 2014 seepage from the 22 9 million tons of tailing at the bluewater mill have affected the rio san jose alluvial aquifer and the san andres glorieta aquifer a major water source for irrigation and municipal supply in the region u s department of energy usdoe 2014 the homestake mill the focus of the grp is located 5 5 miles north of milan was built in 1957 and was decommissioned in 1990 the homestake mill currently is undergoing closure with a focus on restoring groundwater affected by seepage from an unlined impoundment the large tailing pile ltp composed of 21 million tons of tailing from an alkaline sodium carbonate leach milling process homestake mining company hmc 2012 groundwater quality in the alluvial aquifer and other aquifers at the grp is being restored by extraction of groundwater reinjection to provide hydraulic damming and enhance flushing of the aquifer and treatment through reverse osmosis and zeolite systems to meet restoration goals established by the nrc new mexico environment department and usepa groundwater restoration of the alluvial groundwater system will be complete when the groundwater protection standards gwps for individual constituents are achieved the majority of these standards are based upon a study of alluvial groundwater quality upgradient of the grp during the period 1995 2004 nrc 2006 to ensure that the standards are representative of the natural alluvial system gwps for uranium nitrate selenium sulfate tds thorium 230 and vanadium are based on their background concentration in the lower basin alluvial aquifer upgradient of the grp site the gwps for molybdenum chloride and combined radium 226 radium 228 are based upon epa water quality standards or guidance the epa and nmed water quality standard for uranium is 0 03 mg per liter mg l u s federal code of regulations new mexico administrative code and the background concentration of uranium at the grp is 0 16 mg l 1 5 dual domain source of inorganics this work investigates the source of inorganic constituents to groundwater from lower permeability materials in the aquifer system where diffusion is the dominant constituent transport mechanism as opposed to advection dominated high permeability materials various studies discussed below show that uranium in natural systems characterized by fine grained low permeability sediments undergoes cycles of storage and release providing a constant source of uranium to groundwater advective processes in the large pore spaces of high hydraulic conductivity sediments facilitate groundwater mixing while mixing is limited in the small pore spaces of low permeability sediments consequently the accumulation of uranium in groundwater in low permeability sediments is a greater expression of geochemical characteristics immediately adjacent to the sampling point well while advection dominated flow through coarser grained sediments is more representative of groundwater characteristics that have been averaged over a larger area the conceptual model presented in this paper in fig 3 shows 1 weathering of bedrock hosted uranium deposits and transport and deposition of naturally uranium bearing sediments providing a source of uranium to the alluvium at and upgradient of the grp and 2 processes that occur at the interface of low and high permeability sediments resulting in local fine grain sediment sourced uranium into groundwater uranium s dynamic geochemical behavior is rendered even more complex in saturated aquifer sediments composed of multiple hydraulic domains such as those that exist at the grp at the large scale groundwater flow and solute flux in an alluvial aquifer is dominated by advection through the most permeable materials in the case of the lower basin this is the sand and gravel dominated strata however finer grained sediments e g silts and clays contain porosity that is accessed only through diffusion fine grained low permeability sediments have been shown to accumulate uranium from groundwater in aquifer systems where uranium is present as a contaminant lefebvre et al 2019 studied the cycling of uranium in the upper colorado river basin with a focus on the presence of naturally reduced zones nrzs established in fine grained material 150 micron μm grain size containing reduced iron minerals the authors concluded that these nrzs constitute a significant source of uranium to pore water through oxidation of uranium and release to surrounding high permeability zones in coarse grained sediments at riverton wyoming a legacy mill tailings site managed by the usdoe uranium in groundwater was found to be retained in silts and released to groundwater in sands and gravels resulting in a persistent uranium plume in the aquifer downgradient from the mill johnson et al 2018 in both cases uranium in groundwater was derived from seepage from mill tailings and bore the chemical signature of this seepage in terms of major and trace element composition sampling locations for the work presented in this paper are upgradient of the grp and did not show evidence of mill related contamination however the principles of cycled liberation and sequestration of uranium apply in fact johnson et al 2018 also saw release of uranium sulfate and chloride from a location outside of their contaminant plume and concluded that the release of these constituents was a naturally occurring process a study in the jacobsville sandstone in michigan s upper peninsula combined the evaluation of groundwater quality 235u 238u isotope ratios and geophysical logging of wells to develop an understanding of the presence of uranium in groundwater at concentrations exceeding 30 μg per liter μg l at locations outside of mining or milling influence sherman et al 2007 uranium bearing unconsolidated strata were identified through geophysical methods to be clay dominated and laterally contiguous over tens of meters groundwater in contact with these clay dominated strata showed elevated concentrations of uranium uranium associated with heavy minerals such as thorium in shale were less readily leached due to uranium s lower solubility when complexed with thorium and due to the lower permeability of the shales elevated concentrations of uranium in the oxidized alkaline aquifer were attributed to dissolution of secondarily precipitated uranium minerals in the clay and unconsolidated sandy sediments in the area sherman et al 2007 the tono uranium deposit in japan is a fluvial lignite bearing formation containing uranium due to reducing conditions induced by lignite and pyrite yoshida et al 1994 uranium in these sediments was found in association with framboidal and micro subhedral pyrite as well as with biotite in clays uranium concentrations are relatively low in groundwater at 0 05 to 0 2 μg l due to the low permeability of the sandstone and very low tds 100 mg l and alkalinity 80 mg l unlike most studies investigating the source of uranium to groundwater the low permeability deep anoxic groundwater system here does not show a redox transition at the interface of the fine and coarse grained sediments consequently the dissolution of uranium from host mineral phases is limited uranium in a quaternary aquifer system of the datong basin in china where the concentration of geogenic uranium in sediments ranged from 1 9 to 8 8 mg kg highest concentrations were present in the finer grained sediments was shown to contribute uranium to shallow groundwater at concentrations up to 119 to 209 μg l this work demonstrated the importance of oxidation process and weather of uranium bearing minerals by bicarbonate with the formation of calcium uranium carbonate complexes predicted through geochemical modeling wu et al 2019 the above summary of the variable occurrence of chemical forms of uranium relevant to ore formation and subsequent weathering erosion and deposition and the dynamic nature of uranium mobility influenced by geochemical conditions of the groundwater system were evaluated within the groundwater system in the grants region and lower smcb the hypothesis guiding this work is that uranium in groundwater upgradient from the mill is naturally sourced from the alluvial sediments and the background concentration is affected by variability in lithology mineralogy and groundwater chemistry within the system 2 methods 2 1 sediment sampling and analysis in january 2018 two boreholes were completed using rotosonic drilling adjacent to existing upgradient wells dd and dd2 in the background area at the grp fig 4 detailed boring logs were completed for the alluvial materials with boreholes drilled down to and a short distance into chinle fm shale bedrock to 85 feet bgs total depth for borehole dd bk 10 feet southeast of well dd and 100 feet bgs at borehole dd2 bk 40 feet northeast of well dd2 cores were recovered staged on plastic tarps

ms the leachability of uranium and trace elements were evaluated by usepa method 1312 modified with an alkaline extractant in lieu of the standard acidic extractant per kohler et al 2004 five samples from dd bk and four from dd2 bk were analyzed by acz laboratories in steamboat springs colorado for grain size distribution by hydrometer asa no 9 pt 1 section 15 5 based on the results of the total uranium analysis eight samples were selected and sent to dcm science laboratory lakewood colorado for optical evaluation of mineralogy using a leitz ortholux pol bk petrographic microscope and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds via field emission scanning electron microscope tescan standard thin sections could not be prepared on a number of the samples due to the high swelling clay content in these cases polished billets were carbon coated for analysis by sem eds six samples were evaluated by powder x ray diffraction xrd on a phillips xrg 3100 x ray diffractometer xrd was conducted over a range of 4 to 45 2θ cu kα radiation 40 kv 25 milliamperes estimates of mineral concentrations were based on relative peak heights and reference intensity ratios clay specific xrd was conducted on two samples by segregating the 2 μm size fraction through suspension in water centrifugation filtration and mounting of the clay slab caught on the filter 2 2 geophysical assessment 2016 and 2018 usgs conducted a geophysical logging event from august 8 through 13 2016 at six monitoring wells completed in the alluvial aquifer dd dd2 mv nd q t11

ray spectroscopy logging was performed in two modes dynamic 3 feet per minute downward and upward and static at pre selected depths the dynamic data were reviewed in the field to select the static measurement depths each static measurement was made over a 15 to 20 minute period to ensure that a statistically significant integrated value would result the natural gamma ray spectroscopy data collected from boreholes dd bk and dd2 bkwere modeled in wellcad to calculate the estimated uranium thorium and potassium content of the alluvium at specific static measurement depth intervals the spectral stripping method was used ellis and singer 2008 and a specific calibration model for the logging probe was used to calculate the weight based concentrations borehole geophysical graphic logs

were collected from 8 alluvial wells immediately surrounding and on the site capturing a range of groundwater quality across the grp including background wells the six alluvial monitoring wells that were subjected to geophysical logging dd dd2 mv nd q and t 11 were also sampled through passive diffusion samplers pds and micropurge mp methods in addition to the conventional pumping volumetric purge vp sampling techniques harte et al 2019 table 1 this paper focuses on the results from the vp split duplicate samples were collected concurrently at each location by the usgs and homestake mining company hmc and excepting stable sulfur isotope analyses they were analyzed separately at different laboratories resulting in two datasets the data presented here are results from the hmc

metals major anions and cations and stable sulfur and uranium isotopic analysis table 1 3 results 3 1 geophysical assessment and lithological logging the combination of detailed core logging and geophysical methods yields a high resolution picture of the subsurface that included alternating lenses of silty sands and clays of various thicknesses ranging from less than 1 foot to greater than 20 feet abrupt changes in lithology type e g gravel to silty clay with depth are observed see geophysical logs in supplemental s 1 and boring logs in supplemental s 2 core logging indicates that coarse grained intervals are composed primarily of sand with trace gravel localized in thin layers clay layers range from 0 5 inch to several feet in thickness and are generally hard with moderate to high plasticity results from particle size analysis conducted on eight samples corroborate the field observations the coarser grained soils are sub rounded to angular coarse grained layers often contain fines and clay materials sometimes cementing lithic fragments of varying color fig 5 results of the geophysical assessment of the six existing wells and two new boreholes indicate that the central portion of the alluvial channel has more coarse grained material compared to the flanks of the alluvial channel well locations within the center of the channel exhibit a lower uranium concentration in sediment and the association between coarse grain size and lower uranium content is discernible in contrast the wells at the flanks of the valley have more fine grained materials and exhibit a higher frequency of elevated readings of uranium in wells dd and dd2 on the western margin of the alluvial channel there are several uranium concentration peaks in the sediments in the screened interval the localized concentration of uranium in the sediment layers near dd and dd2 results in differences in uranium concentration in groundwater the thorium potassium ratio can be used to estimate the types of clay minerals present and infer the relative maturity of sediments a ratio less than 0 3 indicates that the source of radioactive potassium is primarily found in potassium feldspars and potassium bearing evaporite minerals progressively higher ratios signal transition from detrital micas glauconite is only found as an authigenic marine clay and is not relevant here illite mixed layer clays illite montmorillonite and chlorite and kaolinite a majority of the samples exhibit mixed layer clay characteristics which supports the petrographic microscopy and sem results 3 2 xrd and petrographic and scanning electron microscopy xrd was completed on six samples two of these samples received both bulk mineralogy xrd and clay specific xrd the general characteristics for both fine and coarse grained sediments include ubiquity of fine grained materials mixtures of oxidized and reduced phase minerals e g sulfates oxides and sulfides and widespread presence of iron oxides the clay xrd results indicate that the clays consist of smectite illite and kaolinite and microscopy shows that clays frequently contain organic material and amorphous iron oxide pyrite and framboidal pyrite pseudomorphs as iron oxides both xrd and microscopy show that the majority of the non clay material is quartz potassium feldspar and plagioclase representing erosion and weathering products from arkosic sandstones granites are not prevalent in the area and occasional indications of basalt and other volcanics including volcanic glass clay is observed as a cementing agent for fine grained quartz and feldspar fig 5b 5d and as a coating for larger silicate fragments occasionally calcite gypsum and hematite are detected through xrd and microscopy visual observation by the laboratory suggests that up to 3 of the material is iron oxide due to the red color of the samples as this is not seen in the xrd spectra the iron oxide is assumed to be amorphous most samples contain pyrite framboids and or iron oxide pseudomorphs of pyrite framboids fig 5f and organic carbon fig 5a 5b feldspar is detected in six samples volcanic glass is observed in one sample in borehole dd2 bk at 25 26 feet bgs vanadium is detected in the eds analysis soil from both dd2 bk at 25 to 26 feet bgs and 60 to 61 feet bgs show a clay mass with vanadium and rare earth elements this sample contains 32 mg per kilogram mg kg vanadium one of the highest concentrations measured in this study vanadium in soil is generally present at much higher concentrations 10 to 15x than uranium uranium is not detected in the samples by sem eds this could be due to two factors 1 either the uranium is segregated into discrete mineral phases such as uraninite and the probability of encountering one of these mineral fragments is very low or 2 the uranium is so finely disseminated throughout the sample that it occurs in concentrations below the detection limit of the eds i e it is present at a concentration less than 1000 ppm 0 1 wt or 1000 mg kg in any one area automated eds mapping was not performed this approach may have enabled detection of uranium if detection is predominantly limited by factor 1 while uranium and vanadium are often associated in environmental samples vanadium is typically less soluble than uranium and it does not form soluble complexes with carbonate wright et al 2014 which could explain why solid vanadium was seen in these samples via sem eds and uranium was not while uranium may oxidize and dissolve in pore water vanadium may be more strongly retained and preserved at higher concentrations in the soils telfeyan et al 2015 3 3 bulk chemistry the highest uranium concentrations 1 10 mg kg generally occur in fine grained materials including clay silt and silty fine sands table 2 in one case a gravelly sand with silt contained 5 mg kg uranium higher uranium concentrations are associated with higher concentrations of aluminum iron phosphorus potassium sodium and vanadium fig 6 metals metalloids such as molybdenum and selenium are not detected during bulk chemistry analysis in most samples but are detected in leached samples indicating low level presence in samples uranium is detected in samples collected both above and below the water table at each boring and the highest uranium concentration 10 mg kg is measured in clay in the unsaturated zone at 11 12 feet bgs approximately 30 feet above the groundwater table which varies seasonally between 40 45 feet bgs in this area 3 4 leach tests leached molybdenum selenium and uranium are roughly inversely proportional to the bulk of the total metals concentrations for aluminum iron phosphorus potassium and sodium at each depth for samples with high total metals concentration low to moderate leaching of molybdenum selenium and uranium is apparent higher uranium and vanadium concentrations are leached from clay and silt containing samples compared to samples that are primarily sand fig 6 uranium

concentration leached selenium is generally detected in samples collected from fine grained lithologies that exhibit higher iron concentrations and do not always correspond to a higher leached uranium concentration the presence of molybdenum is generally positively correlated with the presence of higher concentrations of uranium 3 5 groundwater results stiff diagrams were prepared for each well fig 7 upgradient alluvial wells dd dd2 p3 and q are characterized by high sulfate moderate calcium and low chloride upgradient alluvial well nd contains about an order of magnitude lower tds and is characterized by moderate sodium potassium and sulfate and low calcium magnesium chloride and alkalinity t11 and st wells that are affected by site contamination present the classic anvil shape with a high sodium potassium and sulfate and moderate amounts of calcium magnesium chloride and alkalinity well mv is also known to be affected by the site but is farther away from the tailings piles and shows lower concentrations of all major ions than wells located close to the piles concentrations of milled uranium ore geochemical markers tailing derived uranium molybdenum and vanadium are highest in well t11 which is screened in the alluvium beneath the ltp uranium concentrations in the alluvial aquifer vary from 0 0188 mg l in near upgradient alluvial well nd to 8 39 mg l in t11 the uranium concentrations in groundwater at upgradient well nd on the eastern side of the alluvial channel are low when compared to upgradient wells dd 0 0869 mg l and dd2 0 221 mg l on the western side of the alluvial channel demonstrating the local heterogeneity in uranium concentrations across the alluvial channel vanadium concentrations are highest at t11 0 09 mg l and low to non detect at other wells previous reports show that molybdenum is not highly labile in alluvial groundwater at the site and that it is associated with seepage from the ltp hydro engineering 2018 molybdenum is measured at concentrations of 23 2 mg l at well t11 and approximately 7 mg l at well st located on the southwest corner of the ltp molybdenum was also detected at a concentration of 0 02 mg l at well mv located in the site affected area due to its association with ltp seepage molybdenum can be used as a tracer of ltp affected groundwater geochemical modeling of waters at the grp show that molybdenum is predicted to be present predominantly as soluble molybdate moo4 2 in tailing porewater and groundwater and to exhibit slightly more sorption to iron mineral phases than uranium hmc 2019 molybdenum concentrations at upgradient wells dd and dd2 are an order of magnitude lower at 0 002 and 0 001 mg l respectively selenium concentrations in the alluvial aquifer vary from 0 005 mg l at upgradient well dd2 to 0 416 mg l in upgradient well q at locations affected by ltp seepage the selenium concentrations vary from 0 151 mg l well t11 to 0 033 mg l well mv the concentration at well dd 0 114 mg l is much higher than at well dd2 0 0005 mg l even though they are close to each other approximately 500 feet isotopic analysis of sulfate and uranium was conducted to gain additional insight into the source of water and solutes in groundwater sulfate δ 34s values for site groundwater samples vary from 30 4 per mille to 7 7 and sulfate concentrations vary from 244 to 4670 mg l supplemental s 3 groundwater samples collected from the upgradient alluvial aquifer wells dd dd2 p3 and q exhibit δ 34s values varying from 30 4 to 25 5 and sulfate concentrations ranging from 931 to 2330 mg l the uranium activity ratio uar defined as the ratio of u 234 to u 238 was calculated to evaluate potential sources of uranium to groundwater the uar in rock material or in water resulting from acidic or alkaline milling generally has an isotopic ratio of 1 or very near 1 due to the similar leach rate for both isotopes during these processes zielinski et al 1997 natural weathering favors leaching of u 234 which is more unstable and is more prone to dissolve into groundwater compared to u 238 dosetto et al 2008 consequently waters with a uar much greater than 1 indicate a natural source water sampled from wells associated with the ltp e g t11 st and mv in the downgradient affected area exhibit a uar of 1 2 or lower generally close to 1 groundwater from wells dd and dd2 exhibit a uar of approximately 1 5 and other upgradient wells exhibit a uar greater than 1 2 table 3 supplemental s 4 4 discussion data from the 2016 groundwater sampling and geophysical assessment and 2018 core sampling and geophysical assessment indicate that the uranium in groundwater at locations upgradient of the ltp is present due to dissolution of natural uranium from native aquifer sediments lithology and alluvium composition suggest that uranium in alluvial sediments which is concentrated in discrete layers consists of eroded material from ore rich formations to the north subsequent changes in redox chemistry either at a macro or micro scale has resulted in cycling of uranium between alluvial sediments solid phase and groundwater dissolved phase predominantly to from lower permeability sediments these processes occur at interfaces between low and high permeability sediments where groundwater flowing in higher permeability coarse grained material interacts with less permeable domains through diffusion into and out of the silts and clays the work completed by usgs at the grp and at upgradient locations hypothesize that interbedded sands and clays at wells dd and dd2 may play a role in developing oxic and reduced water interfaces within the clay beds resulting in mobilization of oxidized uranium from the sediments they also suggest that collection and analysis of core samples such as has been conducted in this study could provide additional insight into this hypothesis harte et al 2019 4 1 alluvium composition and lithology identify eroded ore deposit layers alluvium in the lower basin formed through deposition of eroded material from bedrock formations surrounding the grp which include the ore bearing morrison fm the abrupt transitions between lithology types observed in the boring logs support that sediment deposition occurred primarily through episodic fluvial deposition ephemeral or meandering streams or flood events versus sustained large rivers which would lead to deposition of more gradually graded sediments clasts range from rounded to some angular grains though the majority are sub rounded indicating that the sediments were transported a moderate distance from their source novak szabo et al 2018 microscopy and petrographic microscopy results show that the sediments reflect erosion products from upgradient ore bearing formations potassium feldspar which has only been reported in the westwater canyon and brushy basin members and sparsely in the dakota sandstone is encountered in samples at depths ranging from 9 to 72 feet bgs the lack of potassium feldspar in other bedrock units in the area means that eroded material from the westwater canyon and brushy basin members of the morrison fm was a significant contributor to the formation of the alluvium in the lower basin the presence of trace volcanic glass e g borehole dd2 bk at 25 26 feet bgs reflects minimal erosion from the nearby mount taylor volcanic field thorium potassium ratios calculated from natural gamma ray spectroscopy analyses using the method of quirien et al 1982 show that a majority of the clays in the samples are classified as mixed layer clays and montmorillonite which is the primary clay associated with the brushy basin member of the morrison fm and morrison fm in general santos 1970 brookins 1982 sediments on the eastern side of the alluvial channel e g location nd fig 8 points 41 42 43 have a generally lower thorium potassium ratio and are considered less chemically weathered with illite and micas than sediments on the western side of the alluvial channel e g locations dd dd2 with mixed layer clays montmorillonite chlorite and kaolinite suggesting that the provenance of the sediments is different between the two areas fitzgerald et al 2016 this is likely due to additional sedimentary inputs to the eastern side of the alluvial channel from the lobo creek drainage fig 1 the primary difference in the highland bedrock units between the two areas is the presence of recently deposited volcanics in the east basalts and rhyolite of la jara mesa and the east grants ridge and the apparent decreasing thickness of the morrison fm units on the eastern side of the basin resulting in very little aerial exposure of the ore bearing rock cather 2011 thaden et al 1967 this difference in sediment origin and therefore host rock deposition and weathering profile of the deposited materials is a possible explanation for why groundwater uranium concentrations at well nd on the eastern side of the alluvial channel are approximately an order of magnitude lower than those on the western side of the alluvial channel weathering of the sediments deposited on the western side of the channel across this section has been greater and the sediments have released uranium through the weathering process in addition to uranium detected in the saturated zone uranium was found in samples collected from the vadose zone that are hydrologically isolated in the center of clay deposits this indicates that the uranium could neither be present due to contact with uranium bearing groundwater the samples are approximately 30 feet above the water table nor present due to contact with uranium bearing infiltrating surface water because the samples were collected from the middle of thick sequences of clay deposits where penetration by percolating water would be limited and controlled by capillary forces the highest soil uranium concentration of 10 mg kg was encountered at borehole dd2 bk in the clay layer in the vadose zone at 11 to 12 feet bgs groundwater was encountered at 42 feet bgs the shallowest it has been recorded at well dd or dd2 given the shallow depth and its insulation from water contact we can conclude that the uranium in this sample was emplaced during formation of the alluvium itself this sample is rich in potassium feldspar and organic matter as are common in the uranium bearing morrison fm units 4 2 uranium storage and release in the alluvial sediments the most common features in sediments collected from the lower basin in this study mixed presence of oxidized reduced minerals and predominance of organic rich clays in contact with coarse grained sediments that host oxic groundwater indicate that redox conditions have varied over time which can greatly affect uranium mobility and can contribute to heterogeneous distribution of natural uranium within sediments organic carbon is a persistent source of reducing power in the alluvial system and iron oxides can sorb uranium these microenvironments are important because they can concentration uranium in sediments the majority of the samples contain metal sulfides particularly notably as pyrite framboids pyrite framboids are most often formed by sulfate reducing microbes srb through the reduction of sulfate to sulfide qafoku et al 2009 the framboids are made up of cubic and octahedral pyrite crystals that are roughly uniform in size and aggregate in a spherical structure over time in an oxidizing environment the pyrite can transform into iron oxides this is seen in a sem micrograph from borehole dd2 bk at 51 52 feet bgs where most of the pyrite in two framboids has been converted to iron oxides but select pockets of iron sulfide remain in the center of one of the framboids where oxidizing agents presumably have not yet penetrated fig 5f this process is important for a number of reasons 1 the formation of pyrite by srb fractionates sulfur because the srb preferentially use the lighter sulfur isotope krouse and grinenko 1991 2 oxidation of pyrite originally formed by srb dissolves the pyrite and releases isotopically light sulfate into groundwater supported by the light sulfate measured in groundwater in the lower basin data presented below 3 pyrite is known to be a scavenger of uranium stubbs et al 2006 qafoku et al 2009 and the oxidation of pyrite as seen here could release entrained uranium to groundwater and 4 the presence of pyrite signals that at one time the alluvial materials whether saturated or unsaturated were reducing potentially driving uranium precipitation descostes et al 2010 the transition of the alluvial system or microenvironments therein from reducing to oxidizing has the potential to release uranium through dissolution of pyrite but also through oxidation of uranium iv to uranium vi as discussed previously uranium vi is highly mobile especially in water with high alkalinity the presence of sulfide minerals and their oxidation products e g sulfate in the aquifer system near dd and dd2 provide evidence of a mechanism for sourcing uranium to groundwater from naturally occurring minerals the results of the usgs analysis of uranium retrieved from multi level pds deployment show that the highest uranium concentrations in groundwater are within the depth horizon of finer grained lithologic units demonstrating that these processes oxidation dissolution occur at contact points between the oxidizing carbonate rich groundwater and uranium minerals that reside within these units hmc 2018 harte et al 2019 the usgs conclusions further support this by highlighting the poor relation between uranium and selenium at wells dd and dd2 indicating a non anthropogenic source of uranium at these locations harte et al 2019 4 3 stable sulfur isotopes as an indicator of the mechanism of sulfide mineral formation in the alluvial sediments sulfate δ 34s values in site affected wells t11 and mv were 5 and 6 7 indicating contributions of heavy sulfur to the system most likely from gypsum dissolution or sulfuric acid used during uranium ore milling sulfate δ 34s values for upgradient well groundwater samples are 30 4 at well q 26 2 at well dd 28 7 at well dd2 and 4 9 at well nd jensen 1958 demonstrated that sulfur associated with uranium ores had δ 34s values ranging from 48 to 12 however most values were strongly negative fishman and reynolds 1982 reported δ 34s values ranging from 41 6 to 29 4 for pyrite associated with uranium ore samples collected from the mariano lake new mexico uranium ore deposit the δ 34s values less than 25 for these upgradient groundwater samples excluding well nd indicate that sulfate was derived from oxidation of a reduced sulfur form such as pyrite pyrite is seen via xrd and sem eds in alluvial aquifer sediments including hydraulically isolated clays from boreholes dd bk and dd2 bk as discussed previously framboidal pyrite is pervasive through most samples and is often associated with clay pyrite framboids are likely too friable to transport coherently and likely disintegrated due to physical and chemical destruction in oxic surface waters during transport therefore pyrite framboids must have formed in situ because most framboids are formed by srb the pyrite must have formed relatively soon after initial deposition of sediments where the sediment was protected enough from oxic flowing water to become reducing as recently deposited organic matter began to decay and srb were able to drive sulfate reduction as discussed the subsequent oxidation of sulfide minerals represents a uranium release mechanism through mineral dissolution and direct oxidation of solid phase uranium to dissolved phase uranium 4 4 groundwater geochemistry groundwater analysis identified several distinguishing indicators of site related contamination due to the ltp including very high sodium and potassium concentrations elevated molybdenum 0 005 mg l and uars of less than 1 2 wells on site and in the affected area downgradient of the site t11 st and mv exhibit all three indicators of contamination while wells upgradient of the site dd dd2 p3 q and nd do not exhibit signs of contamination from the ltp wells dd and dd2 which are located near evaporation pond 3 ep 3 do not exhibit signs of contamination by evaporation pond water such as very high sodium and potassium no water has been detected in the leak detection and collection system at ep 3 hydro engineering 2018 5 conclusions this study demonstrates that characterization of alluvial groundwater systems requires use of geologic geophysical mineralogical and chemical methods to fully characterize the sources and background water quality conditions multidisciplinary methods are critical to validate and support established background groundwater concentration values to achieve regulatory closure of uranium mine and processing facilities sediment cores lithologically logged from boreholes dd bk and dd2 bk indicate significant vertical heterogeneity including an alternating sequence of clays silts silty sands sandy silts sands with various amounts of gravel and occasional gravel layers previous drilling logs based on lower resolution sampling and visual soil descriptions suggested that the alluvium was uniform with very low variability in lithology however the alluvial sequence is much more heterogeneous than previous drilling logs have interpreted heterogeneity is also noted in the variable levels of gamma radiation measured at different lithological layers throughout each borehole discrete depth intervals with elevated radioactivity counts are indicated in alluvial sediments from both the saturated and unsaturated zones from various lithological types of materials sedimentary materials in the alluvium contain radioactive constituents deposited differentially as part of the natural depositional sequence likewise downhole geophysical logging indicates that the alluvium is laterally highly variable even over short distances the fine grained materials are found to correlate with elevated uranium from spectral gamma analysis most closely in the lower two units mineralogical analyses show that the alluvium at dd bk and dd2 bk was derived from source rock containing unaltered feldspars claystones that include kaolinite and arkosic sandstones like those found at the upgradient northern boundary of the basin in the westwater canyon and brushy basin members of the morrison fm local bedrock is likely the source of uranium deposited into sediments by fluvial transport and dissolution reprecipitation in the alluvium these alluvial sediments have undergone weathering to variable extents as indicated by the thorium potassium relationship in sediments distributed across the alluvial valley leaching uranium to groundwater at variable concentrations with higher concentrations associated with fine grained sediment consistent with this model geochemical analyses indicate that in general uranium and vanadium co occur at higher concentrations for example soil recovered from dd bk exhibits higher vanadium concentrations when uranium is detectable the highest uranium concentration was encountered in the unsaturated zone indicating that uranium in alluvial deposits is naturally derived due to transport and deposition of naturally uranium rich materials over hundreds to thousands of years a significant aspect of the occurrence of uranium in groundwater from natural sources is the dynamic nature of uranium relative to redox interfaces and cycling between soluble and immobile uranium forms evidence of redox interfaces active to present day is provided in the sediment mineralogy the detection of framboidal pyrite that has been partially converted to iron oxides indicates that a redox change has occurred but that some reduced minerals remain what was once a strongly reducing environment supporting the formation and presence of pyrite is now undergoing oxidation the presence of sulfate minerals in dd bk and dd2 bk including large crystals of gypsum also supports this transition to an oxidized system such a change can result in the release of uranium due to oxidation of low solubility uranium iv to high solubility high mobility uranium vi this is a source of leaching of uranium from solid alluvial materials to groundwater this work suggests that the material in which the well is screened may affect the chemistry of water in the well wells screened in coarse grained sediments may preferentially sample groundwater with geochemistry that is dominated by relatively fast flowing regional groundwater wells screened in fine grained sediments may preferentially yield samples of groundwater with geochemistry that has been influenced by the presence of a greater source term higher concentration of uranium in fines and lower hydraulic conductivity that prevents dilution or washout of constituents shorter screens across targeted lithologic units may provide greater resolution of ambient uranium concentrations and potential spatial variability in concentrations a comprehensive hydrogeological characterization and monitoring approach is particularly important in groundwater systems in areas known to harbor mineralization of economic viability such as the grants mineral belt where the natural occurrence of uranium minerals in alluvial sediments leads to a heterogeneous distribution of uranium concentrations in groundwater the concentrations of uranium in groundwater in this system are greater than the federal water quality standards as such site specific standards have been established and are supported by the findings of this work including 1 the detection of the occurrence of uranium in unsaturated and saturated zone alluvial sediments 2 groundwater chemical composition conducive to the mobilization of uranium out of the sediments 3 the presence of weathered and unweathered pyrite minerals demonstrating a uranium mineral host phase along with organic matter and 4 results of leaching of the alluvial sediments showing uranium mobilization from the sediments and evolution of uranium concentrations in the leachate to concentrations approximating that observed in the groundwater alluvial groundwater systems derived from weathered mineralized bedrock therefore require careful evaluation of water quality to understand background conditions in this case uranium in groundwater results from the influence of chemical dissolution processes occurring at the interface of

continental crust uranium selenium molybdenum and vanadium undergo a series of fractionation events resulting in highly variable concentrations in different rock types uranium exhibits dynamic chemical behavior readily transforming between dissolved and solid forms leading to significant migration and redistribution in geologic systems uranium can be leached from host mineral phases to surface water and or groundwater through a variety of processes but most commonly through exposure to carbonate rich waters generated through carbonate mineral dissolution langmuir 1978 redeposition of uranium occurs in sandstones and other porous host materials in association with geochemically reducing groundwaters or reduced materials the precipitation of uranium at this redox front forms what is referred to as a roll front deposit pyrite and organic matter are integral parts of sandstone strata bound uranium ore and roll front deposits such as in the grants mineral belt providing the reducing power to precipitate uraninite uo2 in the sandstone host brookins 1982 granger and warren 1974 spirakis 1996 plant et al 1999 at the redox interface mackinawite fes pyrite fes2 siderite feco3 iron oxyhydroxide minerals and elemental selenium se0 are frequently encountered granger and warren 1974 within the basin the sequence of this mineralization is understood to be selenium first or with pyrite uranium and vanadium concurrently and molybdenum last brookins 1982 frequently concurrently with the reduction and precipitation of clay or clay like minerals brookins 1990 other trace metals metalloids are nonuniformly distributed through the grants mineral belt reduced phase selenium is present in both ore bearing and barren sandstone as ferroselite within the poison canyon unit in the brushy basin member of the morrison fm cannon 1953 uranium selenites seleniferous pyrite and elemental selenium brookins 1982 have been shown to be present in high concentrations in these redox

also present in ore grade material with molybdenum present as mo vi and uranium of mixed valence as u iv and u vi mixed valence uranium molybdates form primarily where uraninite and molybdenum bearing

uranium ore only by severe alteration can vanadium be released as oxidized v v from the clay mineral structure brookins 1982 ambrosia lake uranium ore can contain up to 3 2 vanadium oxide lee 1976 and vanadium is considered a pathfinder element for uranium ore in this region brookins 1982 uranyl vanadates are important uranium ores in the colorado plateau and form where reduced uranium minerals e g uraninite and reduced vanadium minerals e g montroseite undergo oxidation the resultant minerals such as carnotite k2 uo2 2 v2o8 h2o 3 are very stable finch and murakami 1999 the weathering of uranium bearing vanadates molybdates and selenates in alluvial sediments can result in the release of these elements into the groundwater system alkalinity plays a large role in the dissolution and persistence of uranium in groundwater systems 1 2 regional natural sources of u se and v of the numerous uranium bearing geologic units present in the grants ambrosia lake uranium district several of important economic interest crop out in the basin notably as weathered bluffs surrounding the lower basin fig 2 the majority of the uranium bearing units in the region occur in north northeast dipping jurassic and cretaceous units including the jurassic todilto limestone morrison fm recapture westwater canyon and brushy basin members and the cretaceous dakota sandstone and mancos shale the primary uranium deposits in the morrison fm were formed through deposition at a groundwater geochemical interface with no consensus on the exact origin although deposition with humates and other organic material or deposition at a brine groundwater interface are common origin theories mclemore 2010 after formation of the primary sandstone uranium deposits oxidizing groundwaters remobilized some of the primary deposits and redistributed uranium at a redox interface roll front deposit where oxidized waters could not access remnant primary sandstone uranium deposits remained mclemore 2010 penecontemporaneously formed uranium vanadium assemblages are abundant in the deposits brookins 1982 mclemore 2010 in addition uranium is complexed and sorbed onto clay minerals within the mineral

chlorites are often vanadiferous and form alongside coffinite and uraninite brookins 1982 indicating that uranium s association with vanadium and authigenic clays is due to co genesis oxidized mineral

minerals as other reaches of the unit mclemore 2007 but does consistently contain significant selenium beath et al 1940 the westwater canyon member of the morrison fm consists of fluvially deposited arkosic sandstones with angular grains of unaltered feldspar freeman and hilpert 1956 santos 1970 pierson and green 1977 with clay cement heinrich 1958 and interbedded mudstones freeman and hilpert 1956 santos 1970 pierson and green 1977 asphaltite and calcite have replaced clay cement between sand grains and the organic rich asphaltite served as a precipitant for uranium heinrich 1958 the ore

potassium feldspar content in this unit is an identifying characteristic distinguishing the westwater canyon and brushy basin members from other geologic units in the region freeman and hilpert 1956

source of uranium and selenium to groundwater gallaher and cary 1986 the dakota sandstone is a fine to medium grained quartz sandstone that generally contains no feldspar maxwell 1982 uranium is present in tabular masses associated with carbonaceous shales or lignite granger 1963 or in fractures in contact with the underlying brushy basin member of the morrison fm mclemore 2007 the mancos shale currently only crops out in the upper basin and in limited extent on the eastern bluffs leading up to mount taylor located 8 miles to the northeast the mancos shale consists of sandstones with thick interbeds of gray shale thaden et al 1967 the extent that the mancos shale contributed to the alluvial fill of the lower basin is unknown the deepest units that crop out in the valley are the triassic chinle fm with low uranium concentrations which forms the shale and sandstone bedrock beneath the alluvial fill of the lower basin and the triassic wingate sandstone which consists of white quartz eolian sandstone and siltstone that crops out at the base of the bluffs surrounding the valley other units that lack significant uranium content include the jurassic entrada sandstone eolian quartz sandstone siltstone summerville fm clean white quartz sandstone and the bluff sandstone clean quartz eolian sandstone none of the units from the chinle fm to the mancos shale have been noted to contain appreciable feldspar except the morrison fm westwater canyon and brushy basin members and small amounts in the dakota sandstone 1 3 sorption and solubility of uranium and other roll front geochemical markers uranium s association with reduced phases such as pyrite mackinawite siderite and organic carbon makes it susceptible to release through reaction with oxidants such as dissolved oxygen in groundwater release as u vi may be followed immediately by sorption onto oxidized iron minerals e g ferrihydrite or goethite dodge et al 2002 dissolution of this surface bound uranium is dependent on displacement through surface chemical reactions uranium can be stored in reduced minerals sorbed to oxidation products and dissolved through surface desorption reactions leading to the slow release of uranium from minerals to groundwater the rate of desorption of uranium from mineral surfaces varies based on geochemical parameters such as carbonate concentration ph and total dissolved solids tds liu et al 2009 used a multi rate surface complexation model to simulate desorption kinetics and found that greater desorption occurs in the presence of higher tds and carbonate higher alkalinity and ph negatively influence uranium sorption through the formation of uranium carbonate complexes e g highly soluble uo2co3 uo2 co3 2 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 langmuir 1978 solubility is enhanced further in the presence of calcium due to the formation of calcium uranium carbonate complexes these complexes are even more stable in the aqueous phase than uranium carbonate complexes stewart et al 2010 once formed each of these complexes increases the mobility of dissolved uranium by limiting uranium sorption to mineral surfaces attenuation vanadium molybdenum and selenium are also affected by redox conditions and are generally more mobile under oxidizing conditions vanadium has the lowest solubility of these constituents with soluble species dominated by v v as h2vo4 or

sorption and precipitation under reducing conditions smedley and kinniburgh 2017 selenium is released to groundwater primarily through dissolution as selenate seo4 2 as has been documented in the

grants ambrosia lake uranium mining district in northwestern new mexico produced more uranium than any other mining district in the united states between 1951 and 1980 and continues to be an area of exploration and plans for development mclemore 2007 the grants district is located within the colorado plateau an area of approximately 150 000 square miles exposing the cretaceous and jurassic strata and an abundance of economically viable mineral deposits including uranium and vanadium as well as copper silver gypsum coal and oil shale heinrich 1958 mining of uranium deposits in the district began in earnest with the start of the u s atomic energy commission s domestic uranium program in 1948 uranium ore from ambrosia lake was milled at four facilities two are located at the southern terminus of the basin the anaconda bluewater mill and the homestake mill the bluewater mill located west of the grp was built in 1953 to process ore from the todilto limestone carbonate leach and jackpile mine acid leach mclemore 2010 and closed in 1982 mclemore 2007 the mill was transferred from the atlantic richfield company arco to the u s department of energy office of legacy management in 1997 u s department of energy usdoe 2014 seepage from the 22 9 million tons of tailing at the bluewater mill have affected the rio san jose alluvial aquifer and the san andres glorieta aquifer a major water source for irrigation and municipal supply in the region u s department of energy usdoe 2014 the homestake mill the focus of the grp is located 5 5 miles north of milan was built in 1957 and was decommissioned in 1990 the homestake mill currently is undergoing closure with a focus on restoring groundwater affected by seepage from an unlined impoundment the large tailing pile ltp composed of 21 million tons of tailing from an alkaline sodium carbonate leach milling process homestake mining company hmc 2012 groundwater quality in the alluvial aquifer and other aquifers at the grp is being restored by extraction of groundwater reinjection to provide hydraulic damming and enhance flushing of the aquifer and treatment through reverse osmosis and zeolite systems to meet restoration goals established by the nrc new mexico environment department and usepa groundwater restoration of the alluvial groundwater system will be complete when the groundwater protection standards gwps for individual constituents are achieved the majority of these standards are based upon a study of alluvial groundwater quality upgradient of the grp during the period 1995 2004 nrc 2006 to ensure that the standards are representative of the natural alluvial system gwps for uranium nitrate selenium sulfate tds thorium 230 and vanadium are based on their background concentration in the lower basin alluvial aquifer upgradient of the grp site the gwps for molybdenum chloride and combined radium 226 radium 228 are based upon epa water quality standards or guidance the epa and nmed water quality standard for uranium is 0 03 mg per liter mg l u s federal code of regulations new mexico administrative code and the background concentration of uranium at the grp is 0 16 mg l 1 5 dual domain source of inorganics this work investigates the source of inorganic constituents to groundwater from lower permeability materials in the aquifer system where diffusion is the dominant constituent transport mechanism as opposed to advection dominated high permeability materials various studies discussed below show that uranium in natural systems characterized by fine grained low permeability sediments undergoes cycles of storage and release providing a constant source of uranium to groundwater advective processes in the large pore spaces of high hydraulic conductivity sediments facilitate groundwater mixing while mixing is limited in the small pore spaces of low permeability sediments consequently the accumulation of uranium in groundwater in low permeability sediments is a greater expression of geochemical characteristics immediately adjacent to the sampling point well while advection dominated flow through coarser grained sediments is more representative of groundwater characteristics that have been averaged over a larger area the conceptual model presented in this paper in fig 3 shows 1 weathering of bedrock hosted uranium deposits and transport and deposition of naturally uranium bearing sediments providing a source of uranium to the alluvium at and upgradient of the grp and 2 processes that occur at the interface of low and high permeability sediments resulting in local fine grain sediment sourced uranium into groundwater uranium s dynamic geochemical behavior is rendered even more complex in saturated aquifer sediments composed of multiple hydraulic domains such as those that exist at the grp at the large scale groundwater flow and solute flux in an alluvial aquifer is dominated by advection through the most permeable materials in the case of the lower basin this is the sand and gravel dominated strata however finer grained sediments e g silts and clays contain porosity that is accessed only through diffusion fine grained low permeability sediments have been shown to accumulate uranium from groundwater in aquifer systems where uranium is present as a contaminant lefebvre et al 2019 studied the cycling of uranium in the upper colorado river basin with a focus on the presence of naturally reduced zones nrzs established in fine grained material 150 micron μm grain size containing reduced iron minerals the authors concluded that these nrzs constitute a significant source of uranium to pore water through oxidation of uranium and release to surrounding high permeability zones in coarse grained sediments at riverton wyoming a legacy mill tailings site managed by the usdoe uranium in groundwater was found to be retained in silts and released to groundwater in sands and gravels resulting in a persistent uranium plume in the aquifer downgradient from the mill johnson et al 2018 in both cases uranium in groundwater was derived from seepage from mill tailings and bore the chemical signature of this seepage in terms of major and trace element composition sampling locations for the work presented in this paper are upgradient of the grp and did not show evidence of mill related contamination however the principles of cycled liberation and sequestration of uranium apply in fact johnson et al 2018 also saw release of uranium sulfate and chloride from a location outside of their contaminant plume and concluded that the release of these constituents was a naturally occurring process a study in the jacobsville sandstone in michigan s upper peninsula combined the evaluation of groundwater quality 235u 238u isotope ratios and geophysical logging of wells to develop an understanding of the presence of uranium in groundwater at concentrations exceeding 30 μg per liter μg l at locations outside of mining or milling influence sherman et al 2007 uranium bearing unconsolidated strata were identified through geophysical methods to be clay dominated and laterally contiguous over tens of meters groundwater in contact with these clay dominated strata showed elevated concentrations of uranium uranium associated with heavy minerals such as thorium in shale were less readily leached due to uranium s lower solubility when complexed with thorium and due to the lower permeability of the shales elevated concentrations of uranium in the oxidized alkaline aquifer were attributed to dissolution of secondarily precipitated uranium minerals in the clay and unconsolidated sandy sediments in the area sherman et al 2007 the tono uranium deposit in japan is a fluvial lignite bearing formation containing uranium due to reducing conditions induced by lignite and pyrite yoshida et al 1994 uranium in these sediments was found in association with framboidal and micro subhedral pyrite as well as with biotite in clays uranium concentrations are relatively low in groundwater at 0 05 to 0 2 μg l due to the low permeability of the sandstone and very low tds 100 mg l and alkalinity 80 mg l unlike most studies investigating the source of uranium to groundwater the low permeability deep anoxic groundwater system here does not show a redox transition at the interface of the fine and coarse grained sediments consequently the dissolution of uranium from host mineral phases is limited uranium in a quaternary aquifer system of the datong basin in china where the concentration of geogenic uranium in sediments ranged from 1 9 to 8 8 mg kg highest concentrations were present in the finer grained sediments was shown to contribute uranium to shallow groundwater at concentrations up to 119 to 209 μg l this work demonstrated the importance of oxidation process and weather of uranium bearing minerals by bicarbonate with the formation of calcium uranium carbonate complexes predicted through geochemical modeling wu et al 2019 the above summary of the variable occurrence of chemical forms of uranium relevant to ore formation and subsequent weathering erosion and deposition and the dynamic nature of uranium mobility influenced by geochemical conditions of the groundwater system were evaluated within the groundwater system in the grants region and lower smcb the hypothesis guiding this work is that uranium in groundwater upgradient from the mill is naturally sourced from the alluvial sediments and the background concentration is affected by variability in lithology mineralogy and groundwater chemistry within the system 2 methods 2 1 sediment sampling and analysis in january 2018 two boreholes were completed using rotosonic drilling adjacent to existing upgradient wells dd and dd2 in the background area at the grp fig 4 detailed boring logs were completed for the alluvial materials with boreholes drilled down to and a short distance into chinle fm shale bedrock to 85 feet bgs total depth for borehole dd bk 10 feet southeast of well dd and 100 feet bgs at borehole dd2 bk 40 feet northeast of well dd2 cores were recovered staged on plastic tarps

scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds via field emission scanning electron microscope tescan standard thin sections could not be prepared on a number of the

ray spectroscopy logging was performed in two modes dynamic 3 feet per minute downward and upward and static at pre selected depths the dynamic data were reviewed in the field to select the static measurement depths each static measurement was made over a 15 to 20 minute period to ensure that a statistically significant integrated value would result the natural gamma ray spectroscopy data collected from boreholes dd bk and dd2 bkwere modeled in wellcad to calculate the estimated uranium thorium and potassium content of the alluvium at specific static measurement depth intervals the spectral stripping method was used ellis and singer 2008 and a specific calibration model for the logging probe was used to calculate the weight based concentrations borehole geophysical graphic logs

purge vp sampling techniques harte et al 2019 table 1 this paper focuses on the results from the vp split duplicate samples were collected concurrently at each location by the usgs and homestake mining company hmc and excepting stable sulfur isotope analyses they were analyzed separately at different laboratories resulting in two datasets the data presented here are results from the hmc

metals major anions and cations and stable sulfur and uranium isotopic analysis table 1 3 results 3 1 geophysical assessment and lithological logging the combination of detailed core logging and geophysical methods yields a high resolution picture of the subsurface that included alternating lenses of silty sands and clays of various thicknesses ranging from less than 1 foot to greater than 20 feet abrupt changes in lithology type e g gravel to silty clay with depth are observed see geophysical logs in supplemental s 1 and boring logs in supplemental s 2 core logging indicates that coarse grained intervals are composed primarily of sand with trace gravel localized in thin layers clay layers range from 0 5 inch to several feet in thickness and are generally hard with moderate to high plasticity results from particle size analysis conducted on eight samples corroborate the field observations the coarser grained soils are sub rounded to angular coarse grained layers often contain fines and clay materials sometimes cementing lithic fragments of varying color fig 5 results of the geophysical assessment of the six existing wells and two new boreholes indicate that the central portion of the alluvial channel has more coarse grained material compared to the flanks of the alluvial channel well locations within the center of the channel exhibit a lower uranium concentration in sediment and the association between coarse grain size and lower uranium content is discernible in contrast the wells at the flanks of the valley have more fine grained materials and exhibit a higher frequency of elevated readings of uranium in wells dd and dd2 on the western margin of the alluvial channel there are several uranium concentration peaks in the sediments in the screened interval the localized concentration of uranium in the sediment layers near dd and dd2 results in differences in uranium concentration in groundwater the thorium potassium ratio can be used to estimate the types of clay minerals present and infer the relative maturity of sediments a ratio less than 0 3 indicates that the source of radioactive potassium is primarily found in potassium feldspars and potassium bearing evaporite minerals progressively higher ratios signal transition from detrital micas glauconite is only found as an authigenic marine clay and is not relevant here illite mixed layer clays illite montmorillonite and chlorite and kaolinite a majority of the samples exhibit mixed layer clay characteristics which supports the petrographic microscopy and sem results 3 2 xrd and petrographic and scanning electron microscopy xrd was completed on six samples two of these samples received both bulk mineralogy xrd and clay specific xrd the general characteristics for both fine and coarse grained sediments include ubiquity of fine grained materials mixtures of oxidized and reduced phase minerals e g sulfates oxides and sulfides and widespread presence of iron oxides the clay xrd results indicate that the clays consist of smectite illite and kaolinite and microscopy shows that clays frequently contain organic material and amorphous iron oxide pyrite and framboidal pyrite pseudomorphs as iron oxides both xrd and microscopy show that the majority of the non clay material is quartz potassium feldspar and plagioclase representing erosion and weathering products from arkosic sandstones granites are not prevalent in the area and occasional indications of basalt and other volcanics including volcanic glass clay is observed as a cementing agent for fine grained quartz and feldspar fig 5b 5d and as a coating for larger silicate fragments occasionally calcite gypsum and hematite are detected through xrd and microscopy visual observation by the laboratory suggests that up to 3 of the material is iron oxide due to the red color of the samples as this is not seen in the xrd spectra the iron oxide is assumed to be amorphous most samples contain pyrite framboids and or iron oxide pseudomorphs of pyrite framboids fig 5f and organic carbon fig 5a 5b feldspar is detected in six samples volcanic glass is observed in one sample in borehole dd2 bk at 25 26 feet bgs vanadium is detected in the eds analysis soil from both dd2 bk at 25 to 26 feet bgs and 60 to 61 feet bgs show a clay mass with vanadium and rare earth elements this sample contains 32 mg per kilogram mg kg vanadium one of the highest concentrations measured in this study vanadium in soil is generally present at much higher concentrations 10 to 15x than uranium uranium is not detected in the samples by sem eds this could be due to two factors 1 either the uranium is segregated into discrete mineral phases such as uraninite and the probability of encountering one of these mineral fragments is very low or 2 the uranium is so finely disseminated throughout the sample that it occurs in concentrations below the detection limit of the eds i e it is present at a concentration less than 1000 ppm 0 1 wt or 1000 mg kg in any one area automated eds mapping was not performed this approach may have enabled detection of uranium if detection is predominantly limited by factor 1 while uranium and vanadium are often associated in environmental samples vanadium is typically less soluble than uranium and it does not form soluble complexes with carbonate wright et al 2014 which could explain why solid vanadium was seen in these samples via sem eds and uranium was not while uranium may oxidize and dissolve in pore water vanadium may be more strongly retained and preserved at higher concentrations in the soils telfeyan et al 2015 3 3 bulk chemistry the highest uranium concentrations 1 10 mg kg generally occur in fine grained materials including clay silt and silty fine sands table 2 in one case a gravelly sand with silt contained 5 mg kg uranium higher uranium concentrations are associated with higher concentrations of aluminum iron phosphorus potassium sodium and vanadium fig 6 metals metalloids such as molybdenum and selenium are not detected during bulk chemistry analysis in most samples but are detected in leached samples indicating low level presence in samples uranium is detected in samples collected both above and below the water table at each boring and the highest uranium concentration 10 mg kg is measured in clay in the unsaturated zone at 11 12 feet bgs approximately 30 feet above the groundwater table which varies seasonally between 40 45 feet bgs in this area 3 4 leach tests leached molybdenum selenium and uranium are roughly inversely proportional to the bulk of the total metals concentrations for aluminum iron phosphorus potassium and sodium at each depth for samples with high total metals concentration low to moderate leaching of molybdenum selenium and uranium is apparent higher uranium and vanadium concentrations are leached from clay and silt containing samples compared to samples that are primarily sand fig 6 uranium exhibits a proportional relationship between the leached concentration and the total uranium concentration and is most leachable in the shallowest and deepest samples analyzed 36 feet bgs silty sand and clay and 67 feet bgs silty fine sands leach test results for vanadium are highest in samples presenting a higher proportion of silts and do not always reflect the highest total vanadium concentration leached selenium is generally detected in samples collected from fine grained lithologies that exhibit higher iron concentrations and do not always correspond to a higher leached uranium concentration the presence of molybdenum is generally positively correlated with the presence of higher concentrations of uranium 3 5 groundwater results stiff diagrams were prepared for each well fig 7 upgradient alluvial wells dd dd2 p3 and q are characterized by high sulfate moderate calcium and low chloride upgradient alluvial well nd contains about an order of magnitude lower tds and is characterized by moderate sodium potassium and sulfate and low calcium magnesium chloride and alkalinity t11 and st wells that are affected by site contamination present the classic anvil shape with a high sodium potassium and sulfate and moderate amounts of calcium magnesium chloride and alkalinity well mv is also known to be affected by the site but is farther away from the tailings piles and shows lower concentrations of all major ions than wells located close to the piles concentrations of milled uranium ore geochemical markers tailing derived uranium molybdenum and vanadium are highest in well t11 which is screened in the alluvium beneath the ltp uranium concentrations in the alluvial aquifer vary from 0 0188 mg l in near upgradient alluvial well nd to 8 39 mg l in t11 the uranium concentrations in groundwater at upgradient well nd on the eastern side of the alluvial channel are low when compared to upgradient wells dd 0 0869 mg l and dd2 0 221 mg l on the western side of the alluvial channel demonstrating the local heterogeneity in uranium concentrations across the alluvial channel vanadium concentrations are highest at t11 0 09 mg l and low to non detect at other wells previous reports show that molybdenum is not highly labile in alluvial groundwater at the site and that it is associated with seepage from the ltp hydro engineering 2018 molybdenum is measured at concentrations of 23 2 mg l at well t11 and approximately 7 mg l at well st located on the southwest corner of the ltp molybdenum was also detected at a concentration of 0 02 mg l at well mv located in the site affected area due to its association with ltp seepage molybdenum can be used as a tracer of ltp affected groundwater geochemical modeling of waters at the grp show that molybdenum is predicted to be present predominantly as soluble molybdate moo4 2 in tailing porewater and groundwater and to exhibit slightly more sorption to iron mineral phases than uranium hmc 2019 molybdenum concentrations at upgradient wells dd and dd2 are an order of magnitude lower at 0 002 and 0 001 mg l respectively selenium concentrations in the alluvial aquifer vary from 0 005 mg l at upgradient well dd2 to 0 416 mg l in upgradient well q at locations affected by ltp seepage the selenium concentrations vary from 0 151 mg l well t11 to 0 033 mg l well mv the concentration at well dd 0 114 mg l is much higher than at well dd2 0 0005 mg l even though they are close to each other approximately 500 feet isotopic analysis of sulfate and uranium was conducted to gain additional insight into the source of water and solutes in groundwater sulfate δ 34s values for site groundwater samples vary from 30 4 per mille to 7 7 and sulfate concentrations vary from 244 to 4670 mg l supplemental s 3 groundwater samples collected from the upgradient alluvial aquifer wells dd dd2 p3 and q exhibit δ 34s values varying from 30 4 to 25 5 and sulfate concentrations ranging from 931 to 2330 mg l the uranium activity ratio uar defined as the ratio of u 234 to u 238 was calculated to evaluate potential sources of uranium to groundwater the uar in rock material or in water resulting from acidic or alkaline milling generally has an isotopic ratio of 1 or very near 1 due to the similar leach rate for both isotopes during these processes zielinski et al 1997 natural weathering favors leaching of u 234 which is more unstable and is more prone to dissolve into groundwater compared to u 238 dosetto et al 2008 consequently waters with a uar much greater than 1 indicate a natural source water sampled from wells associated with the ltp e g t11 st and mv in the downgradient affected area exhibit a uar of 1 2 or lower generally close to 1 groundwater from wells dd and dd2 exhibit a uar of approximately 1 5 and other upgradient wells exhibit a uar greater than 1 2 table 3 supplemental s 4 4 discussion data from the 2016 groundwater sampling and geophysical assessment and 2018 core sampling and geophysical assessment indicate that the uranium in groundwater at locations upgradient of the ltp is present due to dissolution of natural uranium from native aquifer sediments lithology and alluvium composition suggest that uranium in alluvial sediments which is concentrated in discrete layers consists of eroded material from ore rich formations to the north subsequent changes in redox chemistry either at a macro or micro scale has resulted in cycling of uranium between alluvial sediments solid phase and groundwater dissolved phase predominantly to from lower permeability sediments these processes occur at interfaces between low and high permeability sediments where groundwater flowing in higher permeability coarse grained material interacts with less permeable domains through diffusion into and out of the silts and clays the work completed by usgs at the grp and at upgradient locations hypothesize that interbedded sands and clays at wells dd and dd2 may play a role in developing oxic and reduced water interfaces within the clay beds resulting in mobilization of oxidized uranium from the sediments they also suggest that collection and analysis of core samples such as has been conducted in this study could provide additional insight into this hypothesis harte et al 2019 4 1 alluvium composition and lithology identify eroded ore deposit layers alluvium in the lower basin formed through deposition of eroded material from bedrock formations surrounding the grp which include the ore bearing morrison fm the abrupt transitions between lithology types observed in the boring logs support that sediment deposition occurred primarily through episodic fluvial deposition ephemeral or meandering streams or flood events versus sustained large rivers which would lead to deposition of more gradually graded sediments clasts range from rounded to some angular grains though the majority are sub rounded indicating that the sediments were transported a moderate distance from their source novak szabo et al 2018 microscopy and petrographic microscopy results show that the sediments reflect erosion products from upgradient ore bearing formations potassium feldspar which has only been reported in the westwater canyon and brushy basin members and sparsely in the dakota sandstone is encountered in samples at depths ranging from 9 to 72 feet bgs the lack of potassium feldspar in other bedrock units in the area means that eroded material from the westwater canyon and brushy basin members of the morrison fm was a significant contributor to the formation of the alluvium in the lower basin the presence of trace volcanic glass e g borehole dd2 bk at 25 26 feet bgs reflects minimal erosion from the nearby mount taylor volcanic field thorium potassium ratios calculated from natural gamma ray spectroscopy analyses using the method of quirien et al 1982 show that a majority of the clays in the samples are classified as mixed layer clays and montmorillonite which is the primary clay associated with the brushy basin member of the morrison fm and morrison fm in general santos 1970 brookins 1982 sediments on the eastern side of the alluvial channel e g location nd fig 8 points 41 42 43 have a generally lower thorium potassium ratio and are considered less chemically weathered with illite and micas than sediments on the western side of the alluvial channel e g locations dd dd2 with mixed layer clays montmorillonite chlorite and kaolinite suggesting that the provenance of the sediments is different between the two areas fitzgerald et al 2016 this is likely due to additional sedimentary inputs to the eastern side of the alluvial channel from the lobo creek drainage fig 1 the primary difference in the highland bedrock units between the two areas is the presence of recently deposited volcanics in the east basalts and rhyolite of la jara mesa and the east grants ridge and the apparent decreasing thickness of the morrison fm units on the eastern side of the basin resulting in very little aerial exposure of the ore bearing rock cather 2011 thaden et al 1967 this difference in sediment origin and therefore host rock deposition and weathering profile of the deposited materials is a possible explanation for why groundwater uranium concentrations at well nd on the eastern side of the alluvial channel are approximately an order of magnitude lower than those on the western side of the alluvial channel weathering of the sediments deposited on the western side of the channel across this section has been greater and the sediments have released uranium through the weathering process in addition to uranium detected in the saturated zone uranium was found in samples collected from the vadose zone that are hydrologically isolated in the center of clay deposits this indicates that the uranium could neither be present due to contact with uranium bearing groundwater the samples are approximately 30 feet above the water table nor present due to contact with uranium bearing infiltrating surface water because the samples were collected from the middle of thick sequences of clay deposits where penetration by percolating water would be limited and controlled by capillary forces the highest soil uranium concentration of 10 mg kg was encountered at borehole dd2 bk in the clay layer in the vadose zone at 11 to 12 feet bgs groundwater was encountered at 42 feet bgs the shallowest it has been recorded at well dd or dd2 given the shallow depth and its insulation from water contact we can conclude that the uranium in this sample was emplaced during formation of the alluvium itself this sample is rich in potassium feldspar and organic matter as are common in the uranium bearing morrison fm units 4 2 uranium storage and release in the alluvial sediments the most common features in sediments collected from the lower basin in this study mixed presence of oxidized reduced minerals and predominance of organic rich clays in contact with coarse grained sediments that host oxic groundwater indicate that redox conditions have varied over time which can greatly affect uranium mobility and can contribute to heterogeneous distribution of natural uranium within sediments organic carbon is a persistent source of reducing power in the alluvial system and iron oxides can sorb uranium these microenvironments are important because they can concentration uranium in sediments the majority of the samples contain metal sulfides particularly notably as pyrite framboids pyrite framboids are most often formed by sulfate reducing microbes srb through the reduction of sulfate to sulfide qafoku et al 2009 the framboids are made up of cubic and octahedral pyrite crystals that are roughly uniform in size and aggregate in a spherical structure over time in an oxidizing environment the pyrite can transform into iron oxides this is seen in a sem micrograph from borehole dd2 bk at 51 52 feet bgs where most of the pyrite in two framboids has been converted to iron oxides but select pockets of iron sulfide remain in the center of one of the framboids where oxidizing agents presumably have not yet penetrated fig 5f this process is important for a number of reasons 1 the formation of pyrite by srb fractionates sulfur because the srb preferentially use the lighter sulfur isotope krouse and grinenko 1991 2 oxidation of pyrite originally formed by srb dissolves the pyrite and releases isotopically light sulfate into groundwater supported by the light sulfate measured in groundwater in the lower basin data presented below 3 pyrite is known to be a scavenger of uranium stubbs et al 2006 qafoku et al 2009 and the oxidation of pyrite as seen here could release entrained uranium to groundwater and 4 the presence of pyrite signals that at one time the alluvial materials whether saturated or unsaturated were reducing potentially driving uranium precipitation descostes et al 2010 the transition of the alluvial system or microenvironments therein from reducing to oxidizing has the potential to release uranium through dissolution of pyrite but also through oxidation of uranium iv to uranium vi as discussed previously uranium vi is highly mobile especially in water with high alkalinity the presence of sulfide minerals and their oxidation products e g sulfate in the aquifer system near dd and dd2 provide evidence of a mechanism for sourcing uranium to groundwater from naturally occurring minerals the results of the usgs analysis of uranium retrieved from multi level pds deployment show that the highest uranium concentrations in groundwater are within the depth horizon of finer grained lithologic units demonstrating that these processes oxidation dissolution occur at contact points between the oxidizing carbonate rich groundwater and uranium minerals that reside within these units hmc 2018 harte et al 2019 the usgs conclusions further support this by highlighting the poor relation between uranium and selenium at wells dd and dd2 indicating a non anthropogenic source of uranium at these locations harte et al 2019 4 3 stable sulfur isotopes as an indicator of the mechanism of sulfide mineral formation in the alluvial sediments sulfate δ 34s values in site affected wells t11 and mv were 5 and 6 7 indicating contributions of heavy sulfur to the system most likely from gypsum dissolution or sulfuric acid used during uranium ore milling sulfate δ 34s values for upgradient well groundwater samples are 30 4 at well q 26 2 at well dd 28 7 at well dd2 and 4 9 at well nd jensen 1958 demonstrated that sulfur associated with uranium ores had δ 34s values ranging from 48 to 12 however most values were strongly negative fishman and reynolds 1982 reported δ 34s values ranging from 41 6 to 29 4 for pyrite associated with uranium ore samples collected from the mariano lake new mexico uranium ore deposit the δ 34s values less than 25 for these upgradient groundwater samples excluding well nd indicate that sulfate was derived from oxidation of a reduced sulfur form such as pyrite pyrite is seen via xrd and sem eds in alluvial aquifer sediments including hydraulically isolated clays from boreholes dd bk and dd2 bk as discussed previously framboidal pyrite is pervasive through most samples and is often associated with clay pyrite framboids are likely too friable to transport coherently and likely disintegrated due to physical and chemical destruction in oxic surface waters during transport therefore pyrite framboids must have formed in situ because most framboids are formed by srb the pyrite must have formed relatively soon after initial deposition of sediments where the sediment was protected enough from oxic flowing water to become reducing as recently deposited organic matter began to decay and srb were able to drive sulfate reduction as discussed the subsequent oxidation of sulfide minerals represents a uranium release mechanism through mineral dissolution and direct oxidation of solid phase uranium to dissolved phase uranium 4 4 groundwater geochemistry groundwater analysis identified several distinguishing indicators of site related contamination due to the ltp including very high sodium and potassium concentrations elevated molybdenum 0 005 mg l and uars of less than 1 2 wells on site and in the affected area downgradient of the site t11 st and mv exhibit all three indicators of contamination while wells upgradient of the site dd dd2 p3 q and nd do not exhibit signs of contamination from the ltp wells dd and dd2 which are located near evaporation pond 3 ep 3 do not exhibit signs of contamination by evaporation pond water such as very high sodium and potassium no water has been detected in the leak detection and collection system at ep 3 hydro engineering 2018 5 conclusions this study demonstrates that characterization of alluvial groundwater systems requires use of geologic geophysical mineralogical and chemical methods to fully characterize the sources and background water quality conditions multidisciplinary methods are critical to validate and support established background groundwater concentration values to achieve regulatory closure of uranium mine and processing facilities sediment cores lithologically logged from boreholes dd bk and dd2 bk indicate significant vertical heterogeneity including an alternating sequence of clays silts silty sands sandy silts sands with various amounts of gravel and occasional gravel layers previous drilling logs based on lower resolution sampling and visual soil descriptions suggested that the alluvium was uniform with very low variability in lithology however the alluvial sequence is much more heterogeneous than previous drilling logs have interpreted heterogeneity is also noted in the variable levels of gamma radiation measured at different lithological layers throughout each borehole discrete depth intervals with elevated radioactivity counts are indicated in alluvial sediments from both the saturated and unsaturated zones from various lithological types of materials sedimentary materials in the alluvium contain radioactive constituents deposited differentially as part of the natural depositional sequence likewise downhole geophysical logging indicates that the alluvium is laterally highly variable even over short distances the fine grained materials are found to correlate with elevated uranium from spectral gamma analysis most closely in the lower two units mineralogical analyses show that the alluvium at dd bk and dd2 bk was derived from source rock containing unaltered feldspars claystones that include kaolinite and arkosic sandstones like those found at the upgradient northern boundary of the basin in the westwater canyon and brushy basin members of the morrison fm local bedrock is likely the source of uranium deposited into sediments by fluvial transport and dissolution reprecipitation in the alluvium these alluvial sediments have undergone weathering to variable extents as indicated by the thorium potassium relationship in sediments distributed across the alluvial valley leaching uranium to groundwater at variable concentrations with higher concentrations associated with fine grained sediment consistent with this model geochemical analyses indicate that in general uranium and vanadium co occur at higher concentrations for example soil recovered from dd bk exhibits higher vanadium concentrations when uranium is detectable the highest uranium concentration was encountered in the unsaturated zone indicating that uranium in alluvial deposits is naturally derived due to transport and deposition of naturally uranium rich materials over hundreds to thousands of years a significant aspect of the occurrence of uranium in groundwater from natural sources is the dynamic nature of uranium relative to redox interfaces and cycling between soluble and immobile uranium forms evidence of redox interfaces active to present day is provided in the sediment mineralogy the detection of framboidal pyrite that has been partially converted to iron oxides indicates that a redox change has occurred but that some reduced minerals remain what was once a strongly reducing environment supporting the formation and presence of pyrite is now undergoing oxidation the presence of sulfate minerals in dd bk and dd2 bk including large crystals of gypsum also supports this transition to an oxidized system such a change can result in the release of uranium due to oxidation of low solubility uranium iv to high solubility high mobility uranium vi this is a source of leaching of uranium from solid alluvial materials to groundwater this work suggests that the material in which the well is screened may affect the chemistry of water in the well wells screened in coarse grained sediments may preferentially sample groundwater with geochemistry that is dominated by relatively fast flowing regional groundwater wells screened in fine grained sediments may preferentially yield samples of groundwater with geochemistry that has been influenced by the presence of a greater source term higher concentration of uranium in fines and lower hydraulic conductivity that prevents dilution or washout of constituents shorter screens across targeted lithologic units may provide greater resolution of ambient uranium concentrations and potential spatial variability in concentrations a comprehensive hydrogeological characterization and monitoring approach is particularly important in groundwater systems in areas known to harbor mineralization of economic viability such as the grants mineral belt where the natural occurrence of uranium minerals in alluvial sediments leads to a heterogeneous distribution of uranium concentrations in groundwater the concentrations of uranium in groundwater in this system are greater than the federal water quality standards as such site specific standards have been established and are supported by the findings of this work including 1 the detection of the occurrence of uranium in unsaturated and saturated zone alluvial sediments 2 groundwater chemical composition conducive to the mobilization of uranium out of the sediments 3 the presence of weathered and unweathered pyrite minerals demonstrating a uranium mineral host phase along with organic matter and 4 results of leaching of the alluvial sediments showing uranium mobilization from the sediments and evolution of uranium concentrations in the leachate to concentrations approximating that observed in the groundwater alluvial groundwater systems derived from weathered mineralized bedrock therefore require careful evaluation of water quality to understand background conditions in this case uranium in groundwater results from the influence of chemical dissolution processes occurring at the interface of

8411,study region red river basin of the south united states of america study focus we investigated the projected changes in water availability and demand across the red river to identify regions of potential future water stress the vic model was calibrated validated and then run with ensemble forcing from regionally representative global circulation model gcm outputs for different combinations of representative concentration pathways rcps we evaluated the impacts of climate change on streamflows and water availability throughout the basin to estimate future water demand we integrated a series of sector specific regression models fit to historical water usage per county new hydrological insights for the region despite discrepancies among gcms projections all future scenarios include a strong west east gradient in water availability joint consideration of projected water demand and availability reveals that the distribution of future hotspots of water stress is spatially patchy and generally driven by changes in water demand rather than availability these hotspots of future water stress highlight locations of potential water conflicts our approach is likely to be applicable to drought prone river basins worldwide where the spatial patterns of future water availability differ from spatial patterns of future water demand keywords drought u s southern plains climate change impacts water use environmental conservation planning watershed management 1 introduction water resource managers in many large watersheds face two major challenges the impacts of climate change on water availability and the acceleration of human water demand in recent decades changing temperature and precipitation regimes as a consequence of global climatic change have resulted in severe droughts in major watersheds and regional ecosystems around the world stone et al 2002 walthall et al 2013 although projected water availability across different regions does not follow a universally increasing jung and chang 2011 or decreasing pattern milly et al 2005 in many areas a dramatic decrease in freshwater availability is expected by the end of this century ruiz et al 2008 gosling and arnell 2016 bucak et al 2017 at the same time human population growth and increasing urbanism are projected to occur disproportionately in larger river basins dubois 2011 thus many large river basins will be impacted by both decreasing water availability and increasing water demand as a result it is anticipated that by 2050 about 4 8 5 7 billion people out of an expected total global population of 10 billion will experience water stress united nations 2018 these projected water shortages will require efficient water management strategies that are robust to the uncertainty inherent in future projections of water availability and demand hannah et al 2017 strategic water management requires the evaluation of the projected impacts of climate change on water resources at both global and regional scales across multiple time periods garbrecht et al 2004 in recent decades the impacts of climate change on water resources have been widely studied by many researchers across a range of geographic settings and scales nijssen et al 2001 thompson 2001 leung et al 2004 kim and chung 2014 shrestha et al 2017 chen et al 2019 while these studies typically aim to identify locations with lower projected water availability few studies simultaneously quantify projected changes in societal water demand joint consideration of both projected water availability and societal demand is essential for identifying regions where changing water demand may outpace water availability and necessitate proactive water conservation actions in quantifying the potential future impacts of climate change at any scale a key challenge is the identification of uncertainties involved with the projection process of climatic variables hawkins and sutton 2009 these variables include the selection of appropriate general circulation models gcms appropriate downscaling methods and the choice of potential climatic scenarios via representative concentration pathways rcps some recent work in this area utilizes a set of different gcms so that they can capture inter model projection variability for example dore 2005 evaluated the impacts of climate changes under different climate scenarios on the global pattern of precipitation and concluded that the variance of precipitation will increase worldwide leading to a significant shift in the magnitude of extreme events such as drought or floods greve et al 2018 investigated the future projections of water scarcity and concluded that in the coming decades societal and climate changes will lead to further water scarcity worldwide chien et al 2013 used 26 gcms to project total annual streamflow of major rivers in watersheds across the midwestern us and found significant decreases in annual total streamflow in a majority of future climate scenarios christensen and lettenmaier 2007 downscaled 11 future predictions from gcms for the colorado river under 2 rcp levels for three projection periods of 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 and observed that average annual precipitation would decrease by 1 2 through the projection periods regional climate models offer an alternative to mathematical downscaling procedures and entail a different set of parameter uncertainties and error christensen et al 2007 piani et al 2010 river basins in the south central region of the united states exemplify many of the challenges associated with projecting shortages in freshwater resources and growing water demand from domestic environmental and agricultural sectors several studies agree that future drought events in this region are expected to be worse under most future climate scenarios trepanier et al 2015 mcpherson et al 2016 rohli et al 2016 bertand and mcpherson 2018 accurate and continuous projection evaluation and quantification of the limited freshwater in terms of unit area based runoff will be essential for meeting human and ecosystem water needs in this region rose et al 2001 chien et al 2013 zamani sabzi 2016 guo et al 2019 recent work in the southern great plains of the united states provides a foundation for more detailed exploration of the spatial patterns of future water availability and demand across the basin mcpherson et al 2016 investigated the projections of temperature and precipitation under three rcps and three gcms and spatial downscaling techniques for a projection window of 100 years their results predicted that the average temperature could vary from zero up to 6 increase under the highest level of greenhouse gas emission rcp 8 5 in the region most of their scenarios reported more precipitation and streamflow values in the future specifically in the eastern side of the basin the objective of this study is to identify sub regional hotspots within the red river basin where future water demand will likely exceed availability due to either increases in water consumption reductions in zonal runoff or both section 2 of this study presents the characteristics of the study basin climate projections hydrologic modeling framework and describes the five diagnostic indices section 3 illustrates and describes the main results including the projected changes in distributed runoff channel streamflow county level water demand and the resulting combination of both i e availability and demand into the future section 4 provides a discussion into the novelty and limitations of the study finally section 5 concludes and provides general recommendations to regional water policy makers and managers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study basin the study basin is the red river of the south u s a fig 1 the headwaters of the red river are located within the states of new mexico and texas and the river then flows along the texas oklahoma border through arkansas and finally reaches the mississippi river in louisiana the red river is the fourth longest river in the us and the length of its main stream is approximately 2076 km christman et al 2018 usgs 2018 the basin spans a wide variety of climatic conditions and water availability generally follows a strong gradient from west driest to east wettest the average annual precipitation between 1981 and 2010 varied from state to state across the basin with values of 870 mm in texas 920 mm in oklahoma 1260 mm in arkansas and 1590 mm in louisiana us climate data 2019 updated the study basin encompasses multiple tributaries and major dams as illustrated in fig 1 the watershed area of the red river basin is approximately 233 000 k m 2 christman et al 2018 2 2 downscaled climate projections gcm outputs from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2011 that comprised over 50 gcms from 20 modeling centers were utilized to reproduce the past and simulate future climate across the red river basin gcms spatial and temporal resolutions are fixed for each individual model in general resolutions vary from tens to hundreds of kilometers on daily to monthly scales among models gcms retrospective and forecasting simulations span from 1900 to 2005 and 2006 2099 respectively flato et al 2013 there are three main sources of uncertainty involved with the gcms first the structure of the models hawkins and sutton 2009 second the natural variability of the simulated climatic processes such as non seasonal volcanic activity el niño southern oscillation north atlantic oscillation and solar fluctuations and third the unexpected future human activities that would affect the climatic simulations scenarios of greenhouse radiative forcing named rcp vuuren et al 2011 were used in cmip5 to convey uncertainty regarding such a third source rcp levels of 2 6 4 5 6 0 8 5 w m2 account for a plausible realm of positive radiation forcing variability respect to pre industrial levels while it would be best to include all available gcms and rcps to assess the full uncertainty introduced by climate projections it becomes an impractical task due to the computational expenses associated with storing and downscaling each gcm rcp combination plus the vic model outputs therefore a gcm selection process was conducted following the recommendations by mcpherson et al 2016 sheffield et al 2013and foster et al 2013 who assessed gcms based on their air temperature and precipitation biases over north america and central north america and global climate sensitivity over the southern plains region we selected three gcms having a representative spread across the multi model ensemble mean and standard deviation based on the assessment of mcpherson et al 2016 and bertrand and mcpherson 2018 the selection process weighted performance in temperature and precipitation simulations against observations but preserved a portion of the relative uncertainty respect to the cmip5 ensemble in this manner the selected gcms performed on both sides of the ensemble mean but within the interquartile range of the gcm ensemble distribution with one of the selected gcms close to the mean and the other two in the proximity of the lower and upper quartile limits see figs a 1 and a 2 based on this assessment the selected models were the max planck institute for meteorology earth system model low resolution mpi esm lr giorgetta et al 2013 the community climate system model version 4 ccsm4 kluzek 2011 and the model for interdisciplinary research on climate version 5 miroc5 watanabe et al 2010 see table 1 the ensemble comparisons highlight the fact that no set of three models always performed best relative to the others but provide variability above and below the ensemble mean three out of the four cmip5 rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 were selected to represent uncertainty in radiative forcing while also aiming to keep low storage and computational cost the gcm outputs were then downscaled with the objective to use them as inputs for vic while preserving output accuracy with observed ground data as the main premise statistical downscaling was applied to minimize the discrepancies between observed and simulated variables with basis in a weather generator technique weather generators replicate the statistical attributes of a local climate variable mean and variance but not an observed sequence of events wilby et al 1998 additionally since generated values are taken from historical observations the finer scale projections are limited to values inside the training interval additionally the creation of quality check masks for minimum and maximum temperatures and number of wet days allowed removing temperature outliers and the drizzle effect mendlik and gobiet 2013 from the generated time series respect to historic observations a key assumption of a statistical downscaling technique is the time invariance of the relationships between predictors and predictands nonetheless statistically based downscaling has proven to be skillful where and when long term time series of observed variables are assimilated into the statistical model and are well known to preserve the statistical moments of the original distributions that generated the gcm outputs spatial downscaling following quantile mapping methods were applied to convert the projected climatic variables at regional scales with spatial resolution of 1 10 the utilized historical information for quantile mapping is over the period of 1961 2005 and for the future period of 2006 2099 the downscaled variables were daily minimum temperature daily maximum temperature and daily precipitation quantile mapping methods are utilized to modify the existing biases in the probability distributions of the simulated coarse resolution gcms outputs we tested three different quantile mapping methods based on the model output sensitivity a the cumulative density function transform cdft vrac et al 2012 b the equi distant quantile mapping edqm li et al 2010 and c the bias correction quantile mapping bdqm ho et al 2012 the mathematical details of these methods are provided in mcpherson et al 2016 while edqm and cdft share some similarities bcqm appears to underestimate extreme values the transfer functions that are used to predict future regional parameters were calibrated using observed daily and temperature precipitation post processing and recalibration of the projected downscaled values was conducted by comparing with the coarse resolution outputs from the original gcms mcpherson et al 2016 based on this accuracy assessment we selected the cdft downscaling process as it generally had higher accuracy than edqm 2 3 distributed hydrologic modeling downscaled climate forcing along with model physical parameters and land cover data were fed into the vic model to simulate runoff and streamflows reservoir water levels and surface water storage in retrospective historical 1961 2011 and predictive 2011 2099 modes vic is a physically based macroscale rainfall runoff model that utilizes climatic variables to simulate hydrologic processes such as infiltration soil moisture evapotranspiration and surface runoff outputs in sub daily or daily time steps liang et al 1994 1996 vic handles water and energy balances through each individual grid cell within each time step through multiple bands of elevation to represent sub grid scale variability it generates runoff contributions from saturation and infiltration excess using a statistical parameterization a semi distributed conceptual nonlinear rainfall runoff model arno model is also used to simulate the base flow franchini and pacciani 1991 todini 1996 vic uses the variable infiltration curve zhao et al 1980 to account for the spatial heterogeneity of runoff generation it assumes that surface runoff from the upper two soil layers is generated by those areas for which precipitation exceeds storage capacity evapotranspiration is calculated using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 shuttleworth 1993 vic utilizes the developed formulation by liang et al 1994 to express evapotranspiration from three sources canopy layer evaporation e c transpiration from vegetation e t and evaporation from soil e s accounting for sub grid scale variability on land use fractions srivastava et al 2017 the model is fed by sub daily or daily surface meteorological data which includes precipitation minimum and maximum temperature vapor pressure and air pressure wind and downward longwave and shortwave radiations further details of the model can be found in numerous prior studies wood et al 1992 liang et al 1994 1996 ferguson et al 2012 li et al 2013 the principal assumptions of the vic model are 1 land surface is modeled as a grid of large 1 km flat uniform cells and sub grid heterogeneities e g elevation and land cover are handled via statistical distributions 2 land atmosphere fluxes water and energy balances are simulated at a daily time steps 3 water can only enter a grid cell via the atmosphere 4 grid cells are simulated independently of each other 5 routing of streamflow is performed separately from the land surface simulations to quantify the hydrologic impacts of climate change in the rrb we built a climate hydrology modeling framework for runoff projection by setting up and benchmarking the vic version 4 1 2 h livneh livneh et al 2013 data were selected as the observational data set from 1961 to 2011 livneh is based on the methods of maurer et al 2002 consisting on a set of publicly available gridded meteorological data from observed measurements and scaled to match the long term average of the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism precipitation climatology daly et al 2008 livneh data were refined to a spatial resolution of 1 16 and extended to the period from 01 01 1915 to 12 31 2011 livneh et al 2013 since the spatial resolution of the downscaled climate products is 1 10 vic s spatial resolution was re gridded to 1 8 using an area weighted approach the 1 8 digital elevation model dem was derived from the 30 arcsec dem from the shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds flow direction fields were obtained from the river routing network data set produced by wu et al 2011 irrigation was not considered due to the lack of information on spatial distribution and daily rates multi site cascading calibration mscc xue et al 2016 was used to calibrate vic using livneh data as forcing during 1983 1990 model calibration utilized multiple site daily streamflow time series niraula et al 2015 see table b 1 calibration parameters are related to soil vegetation and conceptual framework however a sensitivity analysis similar to the one proposed by demaria et al 2007 and the online documentation for model calibration http www hydro washington edu letternmaier models vic documentation calibration html allowed reducing the number of parameters for subsequent automatic calibration the rest of the parameters were given a priori values as suggested by maurer et al 2002 the calibrated parameters are 1 the shape of the variable infiltration capacity curve b 2 the thickness of the second soil layer d2 3 the thickness of the third soil layer d3 4 the maximum base flow velocity from the lowest soil layer dsmax 5 the fraction of dsmax where nonlinear base flow occurs ds and 6 the fraction of the maximum soil moisture of the lowest soil layer ws where nonlinear base flow occurs in order to assess the performance of the calibrated model parameters a validation procedure was conducted using the same source for forcing data from 1991 to 2011 in both cases the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nsce correlation coefficient cc and percent bias pb were used to assess simulations in light of observations the table b 1 illustrates such different simulation skill metrics at the daily and monthly time scales for streamflow at 35 usgs stations along the rrb see table b 2 based on the relevant monthly statistics mean nsce cc and pb were 0 62 0 80 and 7 for the calibration and 0 59 0 79 and 11 for the validation periods respectively providing confidence on the hydrologic simulations across the basin furthermore more than 70 stations have nsce above 0 50 which despite not perfect further assures value of the hydrologic model simulations of channel streamflow 2 4 analysis of projected low flows previously bertrand and mcpherson 2018 evaluated future climate extremes across the rrb by analyzing the frequency and spatial patterns of heavy precipitation events and the ratio of precipitation to evapotranspiration they defined heavy precipitation events with the 10 and 1 probability of exceedances associated with the historical 90th and 99th percentiles in addition they defined severe drought events at a threshold when the value of standardized precipitation to evapotranspiration index is less than or equal to 1 bertrand and mcpherson 2018 bertrand and mcpherson 2018 concluded that the frequency of severe drought and precipitation events will both increase by the end of 21th century especially under rcp 8 5 in this study we complement the work of bertrand and mcpherson 2018 by utilizing vic model to generate runoff outputs and conduct a low flows frequency analysis through flow duration curves fdcs to investigate the locations where reductions in base flows will be expected in addition we quantify the variability of runoff magnitudes for different exceedance probabilities through various projection periods and compare them with their historical magnitudes under the same exceedance probabilities fdcs are implemented to evaluate the relationship between magnitude and frequency of future versus retrospective simulations of streamflow we built fdcs for nested locations along the channel network to compare the probabilistic variation of water flow values through different projection periods of 2016 2025 2026 2035 2036 2045 and 2046 2055 versus their corresponding values at near present conditions of 2006 2015 to evaluate the drought conditions we focus on runoff magnitudes for three higher exceedance probabilities of 0 99 0 95 and 0 90 through different projection periods to make this comparison we formulate the comparative flow rates cfr index through eq 1 as follows 1 c f r q i q n p where qnp and qi are the near present considered period is the years 2006 2015 and projected streamflows considered periods are the years 2016 to 2025 2026 to 2035 2036 to 2045 and 2046 to 2055 for a given probability of exceedance thus cfr values less than one for a given probability of exceedance indicate declining magnitudes of low flows in the future period for this analysis we focus on vic model outputs from the ccsm4 gcm and the rcp 2 6 emission scenario this particular gcm rcp combination represents a middle ground in terms of future water availability i e it is neither the wettest nor the driest among the scenarios considered 2 5 distributed runoff changes we next focused on changes in distributed runoff i e surface runoff across a 1 8 raster grid within the basin to quantify the distributed changes in runoff due to climate forcing using the retrospective and predictive simulations we introduce an index eq 2 that describes future water availability relative to near present values 2 f r c i r i r p r e s e n t r p r e s e n t where f r c i is the fractional runoff change for the predicted period i r i is the average of the projected runoff output by vic for a specific period i and r p r e s e n t is the average retrospective vic runoff output for the near present period for each benchmark period i the projected runoff change is calculated based on the average of runoff changes within 20 year time frames r p r e s e n t is calculated based on the average of runoff outputs by vic for the period of 2001 2020 recent past and near present conditions the index is calculated for all gcms and rcps for two benchmark periods of i 2040 2060 and i 2065 2085 since even the most arid regions within the basin have greater than zero runoff values for the retrospective period i e rpresent frc can be safely calculated as a fraction for all prediction periods i frc varies between 1 for zero predicted runoff to infinity for enhanced future runoff production frc 0 means that both near present and future runoff are expected to be the same 2 6 channel streamflow changes to evaluate the changes in cumulative streamflow along the channel network we define an index using the retrospective and predictive vic simulations we formulate this index as the ratio of total projected streamflow values predicted streamflow outputs by the vic model to the total historical streamflow values retrospective outputs by the vic model for prescribed time intervals and along the channel network specifically we calculate an index of fractional streamflow change fsc as shown by eq 3 3 f s c i s i s p r e s e n t where f s c i is the fractional streamflow change when the projected mean streamflow for period i si is compared with the near present 2006 2015 conditions s present this index can take values from zero to infinity with values of less equal and greater than one meaning that future streamflow is projected to be lower than equal to and greater than near present streamflow yields 2 7 water demand changes to project changes in county level water demand we utilize past estimates of water use by the u s geological survey for the years 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 solley et al 1988 1993 and 1998 huston et al 2000 kenny et al 2009 maupin et al 2014 dieter et al 2018 water usage in these reports is broken down by societal sector and water source surficial vs ground for each of the 154 counties in the rrb 2 52 35 33 and 32 in new mexico texas oklahoma arkansas and louisiana respectively we extract the consumptive surface water use estimates for eight sectors namely public supply self supplied domestic use industrial irrigation livestock aquaculture mining and thermoelectric we then fit linear regressions describing the change in water usage over time for each sector of each county and extrapolate these fits to estimate water demand in the two selected benchmark years i e 2050 and 2075 in doing so we assume that the change over time in historical water demand per sector is best described by a linear pattern and that future water demand will follow this same trend for those county sectors that showed decreases in demand through time we implemented a lower threshold of 20 of the current water usage average of 2005 2010 and 2015 estimates to curtail future values to asymptotic non zero water use finally to estimate the county level water demand for the future benchmark years we summed the independently estimated sectors we utilize future water demand estimates to calculate the expected changes in demand per county compared to the annual average near present water demand i e the years 2005 2015 specifically we introduce an index of fractional water demand change f w d c i as expressed by eq 4 4 f w d c i w d i w d p r e s e n t w d p r e s e n t the terms f w d c i and w d i are respectively the fractional water demand change and projected water demand for the future period i and w d p r e s e n t is the near present average of water demand 2 8 joint consideration of water availability and demand we propose an index to represent the ratio of the projected change in unit area water availability versus the projected change in water demand to be calculated for each county in the basin for different gcms and rcps our index is calculated through eq 5 as follows 5 w a o d i 1 f r c i 1 f w d c i where w a o d i represents the ratio of regional change in water availability to change in water demand for a future period i and f r c i and f w d c i are the fractional runoff and demand change for the same period i because f w d c i is calculated at the county scale we upscaled frc to the county level as well by taking the average of all frc raster cells within each county we calculated this index for two benchmark time periods of i 2040 2060 and i 2065 2085 w a o d i has a theoretical range of values from zero to infinity across the basin a value of 1 for this index would indicate that the projected change in water availability for the predicted period i is equal to the projected change in water demand in the same period i a value of zero for this index would represent the driest conditions where demand will greatly exceed runoff production with a net negative water balance values greater than one would indicate runoff surpluses that could be used for future water resources conservation or development projects 3 results 3 1 analysis of projected low flows the fdc analysis indicates significant differences between projected streamflow versus near present distributions across the high probability of exceedance values in the rrb fig 2 summarizes the spatial distribution of the cfr index at selected points along the channel network based on the ccsm4 gcm and rcp 2 6 our analysis shows greater runoff values only on some central zones of the basin and the northern side of arkansas region these areas are expected to have higher than normal streamflow values compared to the average of the 2006 2015 period during dry spells and thus will be less likely to experience severe droughts in the projected periods on the other hand there is a significant decrease in low streamflow values for most of the areas across the basin for the period 2046 2055 with respect to the previous three projected decades within most of the western areas of the basin the projected decreases in low flows for future periods could be significantly higher these areas with lower rate of expected runoff values in the future projected periods will be at risk of ecological and environmental vulnerability 3 2 distributed runoff changes quantification of the hydrologic projections for the rrb reveals significant differences and uncertainties among future projections raster maps of frc for the periods 2040 2060 and 2065 2085 are illustrated in figs 3 and 4 for different combinations of gcms and rcps although the frc index shows slightly higher runoff values for the eastern side of the basin compared to the western side changes in runoff vary among combinations of gcms and rcps across all three rcp levels mpi esm lr is the gcm that predicts the highest positive runoff changes particularly in the east side of the basin for this model the rates of frc increase with severity of rcps and progress in time contrastingly the ccsm4 and miroc5 models predict a general trend of less runoff for 4 5 and 8 5 rcps the balance of the projections shows large discrepancies among models in both direction of change and geographic distribution we conclude that the projected runoff changes obey the predicted precipitation and temperature driven evapotranspiration changes while three utilized gcms leaning toward slightly less precipitation in the western side of the rrb and more in the eastern side 3 3 channel streamflow changes along with the projected period by the year 2099 spatially distributed runoff changes fig 5 illustrates the projected fractional rate of streamflow change fsc as calculated by comparing the years 2016 2099 to the years 2006 2015 throughout different locations across the red river network for combinations of gcms and rcps overall we find that changes to streamflow as measured by fsc vary among combinations of gcms and rcps similar to the spatial patterns in frc figs 3 and 4 the miroc5 gcm tends to produce the lowest flows across the basin particularly for rcps 2 6 and 4 5 for both ccsm4 and mpi esm lr it was difficult to draw general conclusions regarding whether streamflow would increase or decrease in future scenarios in output from the ccsm4 gcm for example only the rcp 2 6 scenario showed a universally increasing streamflow pattern the other two emissions scenarios include a mixture of higher and lower streamflows and spatial patterns of lower vs higher flows were reversed between rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 output from the mpi esm lr gcm was similarly diverse only the rcp 8 5 scenario showed a universally decreasing pattern of streamflow and patterns of increasing vs decreasing streamflows were spatially reversed between the rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios 3 4 water demand changes our analysis of water demand across the basin shows net increases over the next 25 50 years while average water demand across the watershed is projected to rise 70 between 2010 and 2050 and 117 between 2010 and 2075 changes in water demand vary widely among counties fig 6 for example high growth counties such as marion winn and union are projected to use more than three times as much water by 2050 other slow growth counties such as howard polk choctaw and bryan are projected to have much lower growth in water demand yet other counties including those in the western and northeastern parts of the basin are projected to have lower societal water demands in the future 3 5 joint consideration of water availability and demand joint consideration of future water availability and demand via the waod index eq 5 reveals hotspots of future water stress during the selected time periods of 2040 2060 fig 7 and 2065 2085 fig 8 both figures reveal locations in the basin where water demand is projected to grow faster than water availability across the basin the majority of counties have waod values less than one for both future time periods suggesting that average water stress is likely to increase in the future basin wide at the same time spatial patterns of waod across the basin are patchy and do not closely adhere to the west east trend in water availability figs 3 and 4 instead spatial patterns of waod seem to be heavily controlled by spatial variability in future water demand fig 6 for example counties that show low change in water demand tend to have greater values for the waod index i e less water stress conversely those counties that show high growth in water demand e g union winn and marion counties tend to have lower values for the waod index highlighting future water stress in these counties 4 discussion given that many large river basins are projected to face both declining water availability gosling and arnell 2016 bucak et al 2017 and growing societal demand for water flörke et al 2018 our approach provides an example of integrating numerical projections and hydrologic model outputs within a climate scenario framework our main contribution lays in the combination of distributed hydrologic runoff and streamflow projections fed with scenarios of cmip 5 downscaled outputs with county level water demand to reach an assessment of the spatial patterns of future water stress across the red river basin our analyses of the projected values of water availability under different scenarios of rcp levels show that increasing temperature would not necessarily lead to a decrease in the precipitation amount across the basin indeed under some gcm projections warmer future temperatures are associated with an increase in precipitation particularly in the eastern side of the basin the use of the vic model reveals interesting patterns in distributed runoff responses that are driven by both differences on geographic distribution of precipitation e g east vs west across the basin but consistent increases in potential evapotranspiration due to warmer temperatures therefore our analyses provide another example of the complex behavior of natural systems in terms of reactions to meteorological changes mccabe and wolock 2011 vano et al 2012 etter et al 2017 the analysis of both climate change induced runoff changes and future societal water demand trends illustrates shifting patterns of water stress across the basin our findings in the red river basin are in line with other recent work that highlights future water stress in the south central united states and around the world few studies have focused on the integration of water availability and demand but see brikowski 2008 and the majority of them have only looked at the climatic prospects alone ojima et al 1999 mcperson et al 2016 qiao et al 2017 bertrand and mcpherson 2018 as a consequence of the limited studies to integrate water supply and demand projections the united states bureau of reclamation declared this region of national interest as a red river focus area of study through the department of interior watersmart initiative calling for comprehensive assessments to attain sustainable water use alternatives hotspots of water stress also represent locations where it will likely be challenging to meet instream flow needs for riverine ecosystems in the future in these settings conservation practitioners often rely on increasingly sophisticated decision support frameworks for guiding water conservation actions to balance societal and ecosystem water needs brown et al 2009 moody et al 2017 jenkins 2018 guo et al 2019 zamani sabzi et al 2019 many of these tools explicitly consider couplings between human and natural system components radeloff et al 2015 including the feasibility of implementing conservation actions popejoy et al 2018 interactions between human actors and agencies at mulitple spatial scales kark et al 2009 neeson et al 2015 milt et al 2017 and interactions between water scarcity and other ecosystem stressors neeson et al 2016 milt et al 2018 the hotspots of declining water availability identified in this study are signicantly driven by the locations of growing societal demand for water mirroring the results of dubois 2011 and flörke et al 2018 however our analysis also underscores the fact that in some particular cases spatial patterns of declining water availability do not necessarily coincide with spatial patterns of increasing societal water demand thus joint consideration of both projected water availability and societal demand is a key step in forecasting and preparing for locations of future water stress romsdahl et al 2013 our study could be refined and extended in three key areas first more sophisticated modeling of future societal water demand within usage sectors may provide a better understanding of the uncertainty surrounding future water demand wurbs 1994 downing et al 2003 charlton and arnell 2011 our projections of future societal water demand integrate trends across different sectors of water use and as a result may be buffered against historical year to year variability within a particular sector second our study could be improved by assessing sensitivity through uncertainty analyses to evaluate the ensemble averages and dispersion of climate projections with a representative set of gcms differences between gcm outputs and downscaling methods could cause differences on the basin integrated projected results the selection of the three rcps however could be maintained as cmip 5 only provides four cases of human induced radiative forcing third future projections of both water availability and demand could be explored in the context of shifting land cover scenarios land cover changes have been shown to have significant impacts some times greater than climate change alone on the hydrological behavior of a watershed particularly on extreme floods and drought conditions dale et al 1997 moreno et al 2016 li et al 2017 though our linear projections of water demand are likely a coarse approximation of future water demand trajectories a linear extrapolation was the most feasible approach given available data and the need to apply the same methodology across the basin to fit these models we used historical county level water demand data published by the united state geological survey these data are only available for 7 years 1985 2015 at five year intervals meaning that there were only 7 data points for each county while water demand trends are in reality almost certainly non linear in many counties wurbs 1994 downing et al 2003 charlton and arnell 2011 we found that it was not possible to fit a non linear model to these 7 data points without overfitting the data we rejected the possibility of time series analysis for similar reasons thus we found that a linear regression model was the best possible choice given the limited number of data points in each county we also evaluated the use of more sophisticated county level water projections created by state agencies using scenario analysis e g the oklahoma water for 2060 plan while these scenario based water demand projections are more sophisticated than our linear extrapolation they are available for only some states ok and tx and we could not determine a method for standardizing projections across all counties given the differing methodologies used in ok and tx overall then our simple linear demand projection may be the best approach given the available data and the need for a model that could be applied across all counties in the basin 5 conclusion we considered future projections for both surface water availability and societal water demand under climate change scenarios for the red river basin a low flow analysis highlighted areas where lower magnitude streamflow values are expected for the same probability of exceedances compared to their recent historical values we found that in general much of the basin would tend to have reduced low flows and those reductions would be more pronounced with increasing rcp levels and prediction lead time we also found that future water demand is likely be spatially patchy across the basin and not likely to mirror the west east trend in water availability our distributed approach to mapping the ratio of change in availability to demand highlighted specific counties and portions of the basin where water stress is expected to increase in the future this analysis suggested that in general the rrb will experience higher rates of water demand and smaller streamflow availability but the ratio of these two factors will vary from county to county this comparative analysis also highlighted hotspots of growing water stress where regional water policy makers and water managers must proactively plan to ensure adequate water

8411,study region red river basin of the south united states of america study focus we investigated the projected changes in water availability and demand across the red river to identify regions of potential future water stress the vic model was calibrated validated and then run with ensemble forcing from regionally representative global circulation model gcm outputs for different combinations of representative concentration pathways rcps we evaluated the impacts of climate change on streamflows and water availability throughout the basin to estimate future water demand we integrated a series of sector specific regression models fit to historical water usage per county new hydrological insights for the region despite discrepancies among gcms projections all future scenarios include a strong west east gradient in water availability joint consideration of projected water demand and availability reveals that the distribution of future hotspots of water stress is spatially patchy and generally driven by changes in water demand rather than availability these hotspots of future water stress highlight locations of potential water conflicts our approach is likely to be applicable to drought prone river basins worldwide where the spatial patterns of future water availability differ from spatial patterns of future water demand keywords drought u s southern plains climate change impacts water use environmental conservation planning watershed management 1 introduction water resource managers in many large watersheds face two major challenges the impacts of climate change on water availability and the acceleration of human water demand in recent decades changing temperature and precipitation regimes as a consequence of global climatic change have resulted in severe droughts in major watersheds and regional ecosystems around the world stone et al 2002 walthall et al 2013 although projected water availability across different regions does not follow a universally increasing jung and chang 2011 or decreasing pattern milly et al 2005 in many areas a dramatic decrease in freshwater availability is expected by the end of this century ruiz et al 2008 gosling and arnell 2016 bucak et al 2017 at the same time human population growth and increasing urbanism are projected to occur disproportionately in larger river basins dubois 2011 thus many large river basins will be impacted by both decreasing water availability and increasing water demand as a result it is anticipated that by 2050 about 4 8 5 7 billion people out of an expected total global population of 10 billion will experience water stress united nations 2018 these projected water shortages will require efficient water management strategies that are robust to the uncertainty inherent in future projections of water availability and demand hannah et al 2017 strategic water management requires the evaluation of the projected impacts of climate change on water resources at both global and regional scales across multiple time periods garbrecht et al 2004 in recent decades the impacts of climate change on water resources have been widely studied by many researchers across a range of geographic settings and scales nijssen et al 2001 thompson 2001 leung et al 2004 kim and chung 2014 shrestha et al 2017 chen et al 2019 while these studies typically aim to identify locations with lower projected water availability few studies simultaneously quantify projected changes in societal water demand joint consideration of both projected water availability and societal demand is essential for identifying regions where changing water demand may outpace water availability and necessitate proactive water conservation actions in quantifying the potential future impacts of climate change at any scale a key challenge is the identification of uncertainties involved with the projection process of climatic variables hawkins and sutton 2009 these variables include the selection of appropriate general circulation models gcms appropriate downscaling methods and the choice of potential climatic scenarios via representative concentration pathways rcps some recent work in this area utilizes a set of different gcms so that they can capture inter model projection variability for example dore 2005 evaluated the impacts of climate changes under different climate scenarios on the global pattern of precipitation and concluded that the variance of precipitation will increase worldwide leading to a significant shift in the magnitude of extreme events such as drought or floods greve et al 2018 investigated the future projections of water scarcity and concluded that in the coming decades societal and climate changes will lead to further water scarcity worldwide chien et al 2013 used 26 gcms to project total annual streamflow of major rivers in watersheds across the midwestern us and found significant decreases in annual total streamflow in a majority of future climate scenarios christensen and lettenmaier 2007 downscaled 11 future predictions from gcms for the colorado river under 2 rcp levels for three projection periods of 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 and observed that average annual precipitation would decrease by 1 2 through the projection periods regional climate models offer an alternative to mathematical downscaling procedures and entail a different set of parameter uncertainties and error christensen et al 2007 piani et al 2010 river basins in the south central region of the united states exemplify many of the challenges associated with projecting shortages in freshwater resources and growing water demand from domestic environmental and agricultural sectors several studies agree that future drought events in this region are expected to be worse under most future climate scenarios trepanier et al 2015 mcpherson et al 2016 rohli et al 2016 bertand and mcpherson 2018 accurate and continuous projection evaluation and quantification of the limited freshwater in terms of unit area based runoff will be essential for meeting human and ecosystem water needs in this region rose et al 2001 chien et al 2013 zamani sabzi 2016 guo et al 2019 recent work in the southern great plains of the united states provides a foundation for more detailed exploration of the spatial patterns of future water availability and demand across the basin mcpherson et al 2016 investigated the projections of temperature and precipitation under three rcps and three gcms and spatial downscaling techniques for a projection window of 100 years their results predicted that the average temperature could vary from zero up to 6 increase under the highest level of greenhouse gas emission rcp 8 5 in the region most of their scenarios reported more precipitation and streamflow values in the future specifically in the eastern side of the basin the objective of this study is to identify sub regional hotspots within the red river basin where future water demand will likely exceed availability due to either increases in water consumption reductions in zonal runoff or both section 2 of this study presents the characteristics of the study basin climate projections hydrologic modeling framework and describes the five diagnostic indices section 3 illustrates and describes the main results including the projected changes in distributed runoff channel streamflow county level water demand and the resulting combination of both i e availability and demand into the future section 4 provides a discussion into the novelty and limitations of the study finally section 5 concludes and provides general recommendations to regional water policy makers and managers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study basin the study basin is the red river of the south u s a fig 1 the headwaters of the red river are located within the states of new mexico and texas and the river then flows along the texas oklahoma border through arkansas and finally reaches the mississippi river in louisiana the red river is the fourth longest river in the us and the length of its main stream is approximately 2076 km christman et al 2018 usgs 2018 the basin spans a wide variety of climatic conditions and water availability generally follows a strong gradient from west driest to east wettest the average annual precipitation between 1981 and 2010 varied from state to state across the basin with values of 870 mm in texas 920 mm in oklahoma 1260 mm in arkansas and 1590 mm in louisiana us climate data 2019 updated the study basin encompasses multiple tributaries and major dams as illustrated in fig 1 the watershed area of the red river basin is approximately 233 000 k m 2 christman et al 2018 2 2 downscaled climate projections gcm outputs from the coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 taylor et al 2011 that comprised over 50 gcms from 20 modeling centers were utilized to reproduce the past and simulate future climate across the red river basin gcms spatial and temporal resolutions are fixed for each individual model in general resolutions vary from tens to hundreds of kilometers on daily to monthly scales among models gcms retrospective and forecasting simulations span from 1900 to 2005 and 2006 2099 respectively flato et al 2013 there are three main sources of uncertainty involved with the gcms first the structure of the models hawkins and sutton 2009 second the natural variability of the simulated climatic processes such as non seasonal volcanic activity el niño southern oscillation north atlantic oscillation and solar fluctuations and third the unexpected future human activities that would affect the climatic simulations scenarios of greenhouse radiative forcing named rcp vuuren et al 2011 were used in cmip5 to convey uncertainty regarding such a third source rcp levels of 2 6 4 5 6 0 8 5 w m2 account for a plausible realm of positive radiation forcing variability respect to pre industrial levels while it would be best to include all available gcms and rcps to assess the full uncertainty introduced by climate projections it becomes an impractical task due to the computational expenses associated with storing and downscaling each gcm rcp combination plus the vic model outputs therefore a gcm selection process was conducted following the recommendations by mcpherson et al 2016 sheffield et al 2013and foster et al 2013 who assessed gcms based on their air temperature and precipitation biases over north america and central north america and global climate sensitivity over the southern plains region we selected three gcms having a representative spread across the multi model ensemble mean and standard deviation based on the assessment of mcpherson et al 2016 and bertrand and mcpherson 2018 the selection process weighted performance in temperature and precipitation simulations against observations but preserved a portion of the relative uncertainty respect to the cmip5 ensemble in this manner the selected gcms performed on both sides of the ensemble mean but within the interquartile range of the gcm ensemble distribution with one of the selected gcms close to the mean and the other two in the proximity of the lower and upper quartile limits see figs a 1 and a 2 based on this assessment the selected models were the max planck institute for meteorology earth system model low resolution mpi esm lr giorgetta et al 2013 the community climate system model version 4 ccsm4 kluzek 2011 and the model for interdisciplinary research on climate version 5 miroc5 watanabe et al 2010 see table 1 the ensemble comparisons highlight the fact that no set of three models always performed best relative to the others but provide variability above and below the ensemble mean three out of the four cmip5 rcps 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 were selected to represent uncertainty in radiative forcing while also aiming to keep low storage and computational cost the gcm outputs were then downscaled with the objective to use them as inputs for vic while preserving output accuracy with observed ground data as the main premise statistical downscaling was applied to minimize the discrepancies between observed and simulated variables with basis in a weather generator technique weather generators replicate the statistical attributes of a local climate variable mean and variance but not an observed sequence of events wilby et al 1998 additionally since generated values are taken from historical observations the finer scale projections are limited to values inside the training interval additionally the creation of quality check masks for minimum and maximum temperatures and number of wet days allowed removing temperature outliers and the drizzle effect mendlik and gobiet 2013 from the generated time series respect to historic observations a key assumption of a statistical downscaling technique is the time invariance of the relationships between predictors and predictands nonetheless statistically based downscaling has proven to be skillful where and when long term time series of observed variables are assimilated into the statistical model and are well known to preserve the statistical moments of the original distributions that generated the gcm outputs spatial downscaling following quantile mapping methods were applied to convert the projected climatic variables at regional scales with spatial resolution of 1 10 the utilized historical information for quantile mapping is over the period of 1961 2005 and for the future period of 2006 2099 the downscaled variables were daily minimum temperature daily maximum temperature and daily precipitation quantile mapping methods are utilized to modify the existing biases in the probability distributions of the simulated coarse resolution gcms outputs we tested three different quantile mapping methods based on the model output sensitivity a the cumulative density function transform cdft vrac et al 2012 b the equi distant quantile mapping edqm li et al 2010 and c the bias correction quantile mapping bdqm ho et al 2012 the mathematical details of these methods are provided in mcpherson et al 2016 while edqm and cdft share some similarities bcqm appears to underestimate extreme values the transfer functions that are used to predict future regional parameters were calibrated using observed daily and temperature precipitation post processing and recalibration of the projected downscaled values was conducted by comparing with the coarse resolution outputs from the original gcms mcpherson et al 2016 based on this accuracy assessment we selected the cdft downscaling process as it generally had higher accuracy than edqm 2 3 distributed hydrologic modeling downscaled climate forcing along with model physical parameters and land cover data were fed into the vic model to simulate runoff and streamflows reservoir water levels and surface water storage in retrospective historical 1961 2011 and predictive 2011 2099 modes vic is a physically based macroscale rainfall runoff model that utilizes climatic variables to simulate hydrologic processes such as infiltration soil moisture evapotranspiration and surface runoff outputs in sub daily or daily time steps liang et al 1994 1996 vic handles water and energy balances through each individual grid cell within each time step through multiple bands of elevation to represent sub grid scale variability it generates runoff contributions from saturation and infiltration excess using a statistical parameterization a semi distributed conceptual nonlinear rainfall runoff model arno model is also used to simulate the base flow franchini and pacciani 1991 todini 1996 vic uses the variable infiltration curve zhao et al 1980 to account for the spatial heterogeneity of runoff generation it assumes that surface runoff from the upper two soil layers is generated by those areas for which precipitation exceeds storage capacity evapotranspiration is calculated using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 shuttleworth 1993 vic utilizes the developed formulation by liang et al 1994 to express evapotranspiration from three sources canopy layer evaporation e c transpiration from vegetation e t and evaporation from soil e s accounting for sub grid scale variability on land use fractions srivastava et al 2017 the model is fed by sub daily or daily surface meteorological data which includes precipitation minimum and maximum temperature vapor pressure and air pressure wind and downward longwave and shortwave radiations further details of the model can be found in numerous prior studies wood et al 1992 liang et al 1994 1996 ferguson et al 2012 li et al 2013 the principal assumptions of the vic model are 1 land surface is modeled as a grid of large 1 km flat uniform cells and sub grid heterogeneities e g elevation and land cover are handled via statistical distributions 2 land atmosphere fluxes water and energy balances are simulated at a daily time steps 3 water can only enter a grid cell via the atmosphere 4 grid cells are simulated independently of each other 5 routing of streamflow is performed separately from the land surface simulations to quantify the hydrologic impacts of climate change in the rrb we built a climate hydrology modeling framework for runoff projection by setting up and benchmarking the vic version 4 1 2 h livneh livneh et al 2013 data were selected as the observational data set from 1961 to 2011 livneh is based on the methods of maurer et al 2002 consisting on a set of publicly available gridded meteorological data from observed measurements and scaled to match the long term average of the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism precipitation climatology daly et al 2008 livneh data were refined to a spatial resolution of 1 16 and extended to the period from 01 01 1915 to 12 31 2011 livneh et al 2013 since the spatial resolution of the downscaled climate products is 1 10 vic s spatial resolution was re gridded to 1 8 using an area weighted approach the 1 8 digital elevation model dem was derived from the 30 arcsec dem from the shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds flow direction fields were obtained from the river routing network data set produced by wu et al 2011 irrigation was not considered due to the lack of information on spatial distribution and daily rates multi site cascading calibration mscc xue et al 2016 was used to calibrate vic using livneh data as forcing during 1983 1990 model calibration utilized multiple site daily streamflow time series niraula et al 2015 see table b 1 calibration parameters are related to soil vegetation and conceptual framework however a sensitivity analysis similar to the one proposed by demaria et al 2007 and the online documentation for model calibration http www hydro washington edu letternmaier models vic documentation calibration html allowed reducing the number of parameters for subsequent automatic calibration the rest of the parameters were given a priori values as suggested by maurer et al 2002 the calibrated parameters are 1 the shape of the variable infiltration capacity curve b 2 the thickness of the second soil layer d2 3 the thickness of the third soil layer d3 4 the maximum base flow velocity from the lowest soil layer dsmax 5 the fraction of dsmax where nonlinear base flow occurs ds and 6 the fraction of the maximum soil moisture of the lowest soil layer ws where nonlinear base flow occurs in order to assess the performance of the calibrated model parameters a validation procedure was conducted using the same source for forcing data from 1991 to 2011 in both cases the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nsce correlation coefficient cc and percent bias pb were used to assess simulations in light of observations the table b 1 illustrates such different simulation skill metrics at the daily and monthly time scales for streamflow at 35 usgs stations along the rrb see table b 2 based on the relevant monthly statistics mean nsce cc and pb were 0 62 0 80 and 7 for the calibration and 0 59 0 79 and 11 for the validation periods respectively providing confidence on the hydrologic simulations across the basin furthermore more than 70 stations have nsce above 0 50 which despite not perfect further assures value of the hydrologic model simulations of channel streamflow 2 4 analysis of projected low flows previously bertrand and mcpherson 2018 evaluated future climate extremes across the rrb by analyzing the frequency and spatial patterns of heavy precipitation events and the ratio of precipitation to evapotranspiration they defined heavy precipitation events with the 10 and 1 probability of exceedances associated with the historical 90th and 99th percentiles in addition they defined severe drought events at a threshold when the value of standardized precipitation to evapotranspiration index is less than or equal to 1 bertrand and mcpherson 2018 bertrand and mcpherson 2018 concluded that the frequency of severe drought and precipitation events will both increase by the end of 21th century especially under rcp 8 5 in this study we complement the work of bertrand and mcpherson 2018 by utilizing vic model to generate runoff outputs and conduct a low flows frequency analysis through flow duration curves fdcs to investigate the locations where reductions in base flows will be expected in addition we quantify the variability of runoff magnitudes for different exceedance probabilities through various projection periods and compare them with their historical magnitudes under the same exceedance probabilities fdcs are implemented to evaluate the relationship between magnitude and frequency of future versus retrospective simulations of streamflow we built fdcs for nested locations along the channel network to compare the probabilistic variation of water flow values through different projection periods of 2016 2025 2026 2035 2036 2045 and 2046 2055 versus their corresponding values at near present conditions of 2006 2015 to evaluate the drought conditions we focus on runoff magnitudes for three higher exceedance probabilities of 0 99 0 95 and 0 90 through different projection periods to make this comparison we formulate the comparative flow rates cfr index through eq 1 as follows 1 c f r q i q n p where qnp and qi are the near present considered period is the years 2006 2015 and projected streamflows considered periods are the years 2016 to 2025 2026 to 2035 2036 to 2045 and 2046 to 2055 for a given probability of exceedance thus cfr values less than one for a given probability of exceedance indicate declining magnitudes of low flows in the future period for this analysis we focus on vic model outputs from the ccsm4 gcm and the rcp 2 6 emission scenario this particular gcm rcp combination represents a middle ground in terms of future water availability i e it is neither the wettest nor the driest among the scenarios considered 2 5 distributed runoff changes we next focused on changes in distributed runoff i e surface runoff across a 1 8 raster grid within the basin to quantify the distributed changes in runoff due to climate forcing using the retrospective and predictive simulations we introduce an index eq 2 that describes future water availability relative to near present values 2 f r c i r i r p r e s e n t r p r e s e n t where f r c i is the fractional runoff change for the predicted period i r i is the average of the projected runoff output by vic for a specific period i and r p r e s e n t is the average retrospective vic runoff output for the near present period for each benchmark period i the projected runoff change is calculated based on the average of runoff changes within 20 year time frames r p r e s e n t is calculated based on the average of runoff outputs by vic for the period of 2001 2020 recent past and near present conditions the index is calculated for all gcms and rcps for two benchmark periods of i 2040 2060 and i 2065 2085 since even the most arid regions within the basin have greater than zero runoff values for the retrospective period i e rpresent frc can be safely calculated as a fraction for all prediction periods i frc varies between 1 for zero predicted runoff to infinity for enhanced future runoff production frc 0 means that both near present and future runoff are expected to be the same 2 6 channel streamflow changes to evaluate the changes in cumulative streamflow along the channel network we define an index using the retrospective and predictive vic simulations we formulate this index as the ratio of total projected streamflow values predicted streamflow outputs by the vic model to the total historical streamflow values retrospective outputs by the vic model for prescribed time intervals and along the channel network specifically we calculate an index of fractional streamflow change fsc as shown by eq 3 3 f s c i s i s p r e s e n t where f s c i is the fractional streamflow change when the projected mean streamflow for period i si is compared with the near present 2006 2015 conditions s present this index can take values from zero to infinity with values of less equal and greater than one meaning that future streamflow is projected to be lower than equal to and greater than near present streamflow yields 2 7 water demand changes to project changes in county level water demand we utilize past estimates of water use by the u s geological survey for the years 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 solley et al 1988 1993 and 1998 huston et al 2000 kenny et al 2009 maupin et al 2014 dieter et al 2018 water usage in these reports is broken down by societal sector and water source surficial vs ground for each of the 154 counties in the rrb 2 52 35 33 and 32 in new mexico texas oklahoma arkansas and louisiana respectively we extract the consumptive surface water use estimates for eight sectors namely public supply self supplied domestic use industrial irrigation livestock aquaculture mining and thermoelectric we then fit linear regressions describing the change in water usage over time for each sector of each county and extrapolate these fits to estimate water demand in the two selected benchmark years i e 2050 and 2075 in doing so we assume that the change over time in historical water demand per sector is best described by a linear pattern and that future water demand will follow this same trend for those county sectors that showed decreases in demand through time we implemented a lower threshold of 20 of the current water usage average of 2005 2010 and 2015 estimates to curtail future values to asymptotic non zero water use finally to estimate the county level water demand for the future benchmark years we summed the independently estimated sectors we utilize future water demand estimates to calculate the expected changes in demand per county compared to the annual average near present water demand i e the years 2005 2015 specifically we introduce an index of fractional water demand change f w d c i as expressed by eq 4 4 f w d c i w d i w d p r e s e n t w d p r e s e n t the terms f w d c i and w d i are respectively the fractional water demand change and projected water demand for the future period i and w d p r e s e n t is the near present average of water demand 2 8 joint consideration of water availability and demand we propose an index to represent the ratio of the projected change in unit area water availability versus the projected change in water demand to be calculated for each county in the basin for different gcms and rcps our index is calculated through eq 5 as follows 5 w a o d i 1 f r c i 1 f w d c i where w a o d i represents the ratio of regional change in water availability to change in water demand for a future period i and f r c i and f w d c i are the fractional runoff and demand change for the same period i because f w d c i is calculated at the county scale we upscaled frc to the county level as well by taking the average of all frc raster cells within each county we calculated this index for two benchmark time periods of i 2040 2060 and i 2065 2085 w a o d i has a theoretical range of values from zero to infinity across the basin a value of 1 for this index would indicate that the projected change in water availability for the predicted period i is equal to the projected change in water demand in the same period i a value of zero for this index would represent the driest conditions where demand will greatly exceed runoff production with a net negative water balance values greater than one would indicate runoff surpluses that could be used for future water resources conservation or development projects 3 results 3 1 analysis of projected low flows the fdc analysis indicates significant differences between projected streamflow versus near present distributions across the high probability of exceedance values in the rrb fig 2 summarizes the spatial distribution of the cfr index at selected points along the channel network based on the ccsm4 gcm and rcp 2 6 our analysis shows greater runoff values only on some central zones of the basin and the northern side of arkansas region these areas are expected to have higher than normal streamflow values compared to the average of the 2006 2015 period during dry spells and thus will be less likely to experience severe droughts in the projected periods on the other hand there is a significant decrease in low streamflow values for most of the areas across the basin for the period 2046 2055 with respect to the previous three projected decades within most of the western areas of the basin the projected decreases in low flows for future periods could be significantly higher these areas with lower rate of expected runoff values in the future projected periods will be at risk of ecological and environmental vulnerability 3 2 distributed runoff changes quantification of the hydrologic projections for the rrb reveals significant differences and uncertainties among future projections raster maps of frc for the periods 2040 2060 and 2065 2085 are illustrated in figs 3 and 4 for different combinations of gcms and rcps although the frc index shows slightly higher runoff values for the eastern side of the basin compared to the western side changes in runoff vary among combinations of gcms and rcps across all three rcp levels mpi esm lr is the gcm that predicts the highest positive runoff changes particularly in the east side of the basin for this model the rates of frc increase with severity of rcps and progress in time contrastingly the ccsm4 and miroc5 models predict a general trend of less runoff for 4 5 and 8 5 rcps the balance of the projections shows large discrepancies among models in both direction of change and geographic distribution we conclude that the projected runoff changes obey the predicted precipitation and temperature driven evapotranspiration changes while three utilized gcms leaning toward slightly less precipitation in the western side of the rrb and more in the eastern side 3 3 channel streamflow changes along with the projected period by the year 2099 spatially distributed runoff changes fig 5 illustrates the projected fractional rate of streamflow change fsc as calculated by comparing the years 2016 2099 to the years 2006 2015 throughout different locations across the red river network for combinations of gcms and rcps overall we find that changes to streamflow as measured by fsc vary among combinations of gcms and rcps similar to the spatial patterns in frc figs 3 and 4 the miroc5 gcm tends to produce the lowest flows across the basin particularly for rcps 2 6 and 4 5 for both ccsm4 and mpi esm lr it was difficult to draw general conclusions regarding whether streamflow would increase or decrease in future scenarios in output from the ccsm4 gcm for example only the rcp 2 6 scenario showed a universally increasing streamflow pattern the other two emissions scenarios include a mixture of higher and lower streamflows and spatial patterns of lower vs higher flows were reversed between rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 output from the mpi esm lr gcm was similarly diverse only the rcp 8 5 scenario showed a universally decreasing pattern of streamflow and patterns of increasing vs decreasing streamflows were spatially reversed between the rcp 2 6 and rcp 4 5 scenarios 3 4 water demand changes our analysis of water demand across the basin shows net increases over the next 25 50 years while average water demand across the watershed is projected to rise 70 between 2010 and 2050 and 117 between 2010 and 2075 changes in water demand vary widely among counties fig 6 for example high growth counties such as marion winn and union are projected to use more than three times as much water by 2050 other slow growth counties such as howard polk choctaw and bryan are projected to have much lower growth in water demand yet other counties including those in the western and northeastern parts of the basin are projected to have lower societal water demands in the future 3 5 joint consideration of water availability and demand joint consideration of future water availability and demand via the waod index eq 5 reveals hotspots of future water stress during the selected time periods of 2040 2060 fig 7 and 2065 2085 fig 8 both figures reveal locations in the basin where water demand is projected to grow faster than water availability across the basin the majority of counties have waod values less than one for both future time periods suggesting that average water stress is likely to increase in the future basin wide at the same time spatial patterns of waod across the basin are patchy and do not closely adhere to the west east trend in water availability figs 3 and 4 instead spatial patterns of waod seem to be heavily controlled by spatial variability in future water demand fig 6 for example counties that show low change in water demand tend to have greater values for the waod index i e less water stress conversely those counties that show high growth in water demand e g union winn and marion counties tend to have lower values for the waod index highlighting future water stress in these counties 4 discussion given that many large river basins are projected to face both declining water availability gosling and arnell 2016 bucak et al 2017 and growing societal demand for water flörke et al 2018 our approach provides an example of integrating numerical projections and hydrologic model outputs within a climate scenario framework our main contribution lays in the combination of distributed hydrologic runoff and streamflow projections fed with scenarios of cmip 5 downscaled outputs with county level water demand to reach an assessment of the spatial patterns of future water stress across the red river basin our analyses of the projected values of water availability under different scenarios of rcp levels show that increasing temperature would not necessarily lead to a decrease in the precipitation amount across the basin indeed under some gcm projections warmer future temperatures are associated with an increase in precipitation particularly in the eastern side of the basin the use of the vic model reveals interesting patterns in distributed runoff responses that are driven by both differences on geographic distribution of precipitation e g east vs west across the basin but consistent increases in potential evapotranspiration due to warmer temperatures therefore our analyses provide another example of the complex behavior of natural systems in terms of reactions to meteorological changes mccabe and wolock 2011 vano et al 2012 etter et al 2017 the analysis of both climate change induced runoff changes and future societal water demand trends illustrates shifting patterns of water stress across the basin our findings in the red river basin are in line with other recent work that highlights future water stress in the south central united states and around the world few studies have focused on the integration of water availability and demand but see brikowski 2008 and the majority of them have only looked at the climatic prospects alone ojima et al 1999 mcperson et al 2016 qiao et al 2017 bertrand and mcpherson 2018 as a consequence of the limited studies to integrate water supply and demand projections the united states bureau of reclamation declared this region of national interest as a red river focus area of study through the department of interior watersmart initiative calling for comprehensive assessments to attain sustainable water use alternatives hotspots of water stress also represent locations where it will likely be challenging to meet instream flow needs for riverine ecosystems in the future in these settings conservation practitioners often rely on increasingly sophisticated decision support frameworks for guiding water conservation actions to balance societal and ecosystem water needs brown et al 2009 moody et al 2017 jenkins 2018 guo et al 2019 zamani sabzi et al 2019 many of these tools explicitly consider couplings between human and natural system components radeloff et al 2015 including the feasibility of implementing conservation actions popejoy et al 2018 interactions between human actors and agencies at mulitple spatial scales kark et al 2009 neeson et al 2015 milt et al 2017 and interactions between water scarcity and other ecosystem stressors neeson et al 2016 milt et al 2018 the hotspots of declining water availability identified in this study are signicantly driven by the locations of growing societal demand for water mirroring the results of dubois 2011 and flörke et al 2018 however our analysis also underscores the fact that in some particular cases spatial patterns of declining water availability do not necessarily coincide with spatial patterns of increasing societal water demand thus joint consideration of both projected water availability and societal demand is a key step in forecasting and preparing for locations of future water stress romsdahl et al 2013 our study could be refined and extended in three key areas first more sophisticated modeling of future societal water demand within usage sectors may provide a better understanding of the uncertainty surrounding future water demand wurbs 1994 downing et al 2003 charlton and arnell 2011 our projections of future societal water demand integrate trends across different sectors of water use and as a result may be buffered against historical year to year variability within a particular sector second our study could be improved by assessing sensitivity through uncertainty analyses to evaluate the ensemble averages and dispersion of climate projections with a representative set of gcms differences between gcm outputs and downscaling methods could cause differences on the basin integrated projected results the selection of the three rcps however could be maintained as cmip 5 only provides four cases of human induced radiative forcing third future projections of both water availability and demand could be explored in the context of shifting land cover scenarios land cover changes have been shown to have significant impacts some times greater than climate change alone on the hydrological behavior of a watershed particularly on extreme floods and drought conditions dale et al 1997 moreno et al 2016 li et al 2017 though our linear projections of water demand are likely a coarse approximation of future water demand trajectories a linear extrapolation was the most feasible approach given available data and the need to apply the same methodology across the basin to fit these models we used historical county level water demand data published by the united state geological survey these data are only available for 7 years 1985 2015 at five year intervals meaning that there were only 7 data points for each county while water demand trends are in reality almost certainly non linear in many counties wurbs 1994 downing et al 2003 charlton and arnell 2011 we found that it was not possible to fit a non linear model to these 7 data points without overfitting the data we rejected the possibility of time series analysis for similar reasons thus we found that a linear regression model was the best possible choice given the limited number of data points in each county we also evaluated the use of more sophisticated county level water projections created by state agencies using scenario analysis e g the oklahoma water for 2060 plan while these scenario based water demand projections are more sophisticated than our linear extrapolation they are available for only some states ok and tx and we could not determine a method for standardizing projections across all counties given the differing methodologies used in ok and tx overall then our simple linear demand projection may be the best approach given the available data and the need for a model that could be applied across all counties in the basin 5 conclusion we considered future projections for both surface water availability and societal water demand under climate change scenarios for the red river basin a low flow analysis highlighted areas where lower magnitude streamflow values are expected for the same probability of exceedances compared to their recent historical values we found that in general much of the basin would tend to have reduced low flows and those reductions would be more pronounced with increasing rcp levels and prediction lead time we also found that future water demand is likely be spatially patchy across the basin and not likely to mirror the west east trend in water availability our distributed approach to mapping the ratio of change in availability to demand highlighted specific counties and portions of the basin where water stress is expected to increase in the future this analysis suggested that in general the rrb will experience higher rates of water demand and smaller streamflow availability but the ratio of these two factors will vary from county to county this comparative analysis also highlighted hotspots of growing water stress where regional water policy makers and water managers must proactively plan to ensure adequate water

8412,study region upper awash basin at the headwater of awash river study focus comprehensive assessment of land cover lc change effect on the water balance components using integrated approaches of hydrologic modeling and partial least squares regression plsr provides better understandings of the impact of recent development activities on water resources the swat model was validated at five subbasins and used to simulate the water balance and hydrologic response to lc changes at multiple temporal and spatial scales plsr was used to evaluate the significance of the relative influence of lc classes on the hydrologic components new hydrological insights for the region based on the multitemporal lc change detections upper awash basin is characterized by the decline of natural vegetation due to the swelling rise of cropland and urbanization the monoplot of plsr components exhibited that groundwater is highly correlated with the forest areas and lateral flow is strongly correlated with pasture whereas surface runoff is significantly attributed to the change in urban and cropland the variable importance for the projection vip and plsr weight w revealed that the decline of groundwater is mainly due to urban vip 1 34 and w 0 55 whereas the change in forest area enhanced groundwater vip 1 04 and w 0 47 the study provides valuable information on the contribution of particular lc to change in water balance which is vital for improved water resources management keywords land cover change water balance component partial least squares regression swat model upper awash basin 1 introduction hydrologic responses to land use land cover lc changes and land management practices are the integrated indicators of the watershed conditions a holistic understanding of the complex and dynamic land surface and its interacting parts is required to make precise predictions of the future water balance feyen and raul 2011 the rapid lc change coupled with climate variability could potentially lead to an increase in hydrologic impacts ewen and parkin 1996 chen and bofu 2013 quantitative assessment of the impact of climate and lc changes on water resource availability is a significant issue for hydrological science yin et al 2017 knowledge of the distribution and types of lc are essential for resource base analysis on land degradation land productivity and its impacts on water resources solomon 1994 bewket 2002 amsalu et al 2007 hence comprehensive and improved procedures that integrate different techniques such as remote sensing hydrologic modeling and statistical approaches are necessary to identify the influence of lc change and land management practices on the hydrological variability of a river basin the rising water demands in the awash river basin due to the booming population growth rate and the socio economic developments are increasing the competition among various water users within subbasins which led the water resources under tremendous pressure chekol 2006 adeba et al 2015 mersha et al 2018 to meet these challenges on water resources management quantification of lc change impact at subbasins and basin scale hydrology are essential understanding the likely effects of lc change in the runoff variability and determining whether these issues can be treated at the source through sustainable land management practices are urgent research needs the future lc change can compromise the water resources and hydrologic water balance which directly affects local communities the biota and possible water management plans abe et al 2018 dos santos et al 2018 the socio economic importance that the awash river offers to the central and eastern parts of ethiopia in particular and the whole nation in general is noteworthy thus a practical understanding of the potential impact of lc change on hydrologic variability should be attained to implement sustainable water resources management plans legesse et al 2003 griffis and stedinger 2008 degraded watersheds tend to accelerate the overland flow which reduces the soil moisture and groundwater recharge various studies used land cover mapping tools and methods to understand lc changes inventory of forest and natural resources as well as understand the changes in the hydrologic behavior of watersheds melesse and jordan 2003 bewket and sterk 2004 mengistu 2009 melesse et al 2009 mango et al 2011 marhaento et al 2017 woldesenbet et al 2017 anand et al 2018b investigating the impact of lc change on the hydrologic processes at subbasins level allows to define the degree of susceptibility of local water resources and helps to plan appropriate mitigation measures that must be taken ahead of time the impacts of agricultural land management practices and lc change scenarios on the water balance are more evident at local subbasin scales however evidence for basin scale impacts is limited wilk and hughes 2002 schilling et al 2014 anand et al 2018b several lc classes carry significant roles and influences on the hydrologic processes mainly on the runoff sedimentation and extreme hydrologic events bahremand 2006 the partial least squares regressions plsr statistical method is particularly well suited to analyze the complex interaction of large array of predictor and dependent variables carrascal et al 2009 the plsr is a new technique which is particularly suitable for multivariate problems when the number of observations is less than the number of possible predictors and when the variables exhibit collinearity wold et al 2001 carrascal et al 2009 onderka et al 2012 shi et al 2013 fang et al 2015 plsr is particularly useful when there is a need to predict a set of dependent variables water balance components from a large set of independent variables land cover types abdi 2003 the integrated approaches of hydrologic modeling using the soil and water assessment tool swat model and plsr analysis can be used to evaluate the relative impact of change in the lc classes on the hydrologic components integrated approaches of hydrologic modeling and statistical analysis to assess the impact of anthropogenic activities on water balance components mainly the relative impact of different lc classes on hydrologic processes is not well studied therefore the objectives of this study are i to simulate the impact of lc change on the hydrologic variability at the subbasins and basin scale and ii to evaluate the relative contributions of change in lc classes on the water balance components based on plsr model in the upper awash basin ethiopia analysis of the hydrologic response of a basin at multiple scales in subbasins can highlight the vulnerable river reaches or subbasins due to the extent of lc change which could help to execute integrated water resources management within the particular subbasin 2 materials and methods 2 1 location of the study area the awash basin is situated between latitudes 7 53 n and 12 n and longitudes of 37 57 e and 43 25 e this study was undertaken in the upper awash basin at the headwater of awash river basin which lies between latitudes 8 16 and 9 18 and longitudes 37 57 and 39 17 as shown in fig 1 the total drainage area of the upper awash basin is estimated to be 11 720 km2 at the outlet of koka reservoir elevations range between 3565 to 1560 m above sea level and the major urban centers of the country such as addis ababa adama and bishoftu are located within the upper awash basin 2 2 model input and data sources 2 2 1 climate data the daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity were collected mainly from the national meteorological service agency of ethiopia nmsa for stations located within the study basin the missing rainfall data were estimated using the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method the rainfall data were obtained from 30 different stations which are indicated in fig 1 and the majority of stations demonstrated peak monthly rainfall patterns in july and august the inter annual variability of rainfall in belg season march may as well as the kiremt rainfall season june august occasionally lead to large scale droughts and floods in the awash river basin nmsa 2001 korecha and sorteberg 2013 moreover the mean monthly maximum and minimum temperature profiles indicated that most of the climate stations demonstrated similar rainfall patterns the spatial variability of mean annual rainfall exhibits larger values in the northern and western part at the upstream of the upper awash basin as shown in the spatially interpolated map in fig 2 b in contrast the higher maximum and minimum temperature were obtained at the southeastern part of the basin fig 2c and d mainly the highest average maximum temperature was recorded at koka station as 32 5 c in may at the downstream part of the basin the lowest average minimum temperature was found to be 6 06 c at addis ababa station in november at the upstream area 2 2 2 hydrological data the instantaneous daily river discharge data for main gauged subbasins were obtained from the ministry of water irrigation and energy ethiopia mowie http mowie gov et observed daily monthly and annual discharge data are required for model calibration and validation the hydrologic year which consists of significant outliers in the data series were not considered from further application for hydrologic modeling thus data periods with relatively consistent data series were taken systematically for model evaluation and comparison 2 2 3 soil properties basic physicochemical properties of major soil types were mainly obtained from the following sources soil database and digital soil map from the mowe harmonized world soil database http webarchive iiasa ac at research luc external world soil database html nachtergaele et al 2010 major soils of the world fao 2002 some soil properties which were not available in the databases such as saturated hydraulic conductivity was estimated based on pedotransfer functions from the readily available data rawls et al 1982 the fao soil classification was used to define the soil type and 12 different soil types were classified as a result 51 of the majority of the basin area is covered by eutric vertisols 11 of vertic cambisols 10 5 humic nitosols and 9 77 chromic luvisols as shown in fig 2a eutric vertisols largely cover in the middle and western part of the basin mostly on the flood plain areas 2 2 4 digital elevation model dem the dem was used to analyze the drainage patterns of the land surface terrain dem with 30 m spatial resolution was used which was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm as shown in fig 1 the land slope class indicates that 54 2 area is between slope class of 0 10 30 7 between 10 20 and the remaining 15 1 is above 20 land slope class which shows the prevalence higher topographic variations in the upper awash basin 2 2 5 land use land cover lc data the land cover lc dataset for the four historical periods was developed from multi temporal series of landsat images the landsat images were obtained from

simulation the soil and water assessment tool swat model is semi distributed physically based computationally efficient and capable of continuous simulation over long periods arnold et al 1998 2012 gassman et al 2007 the main hydrological components simulated in the land phase of the hydrological cycle are evapotranspiration lateral subsurface flow groundwater flow surface runoff ponds canopy storage infiltration redistribution tributary channels and return flow swat simulates the land phase of the hydrological cycle based on the water balance equation neitsch et al 2011 swat model

the hru analysis in swat includes the delineation of hrus by overlaying the spatial map of slope classes land use and soil data hru is the smallest area representation in the swat model which comprises of unique land use soil type and slope parameters hydrologic simulations on the hru level helps to visualize the spatial variation of water balance components of the basin at a relatively smaller area which is vital for planning watershed interventions a total of 77 subbasins were delineated in the upper awash basin the more detailed information about swat model input output documentation theoretical backgrounds software and literature databases are available at https swat tamu edu the swat model application for prediction of streamflow as well as evaluation of the impact of land use land cover and climate change on the hydrology of different watersheds were documented by various studies setegn et al 2009 2011 mango et al 2011 getachew and melesse 2012 dessu and melesse 2013 shawul et al 2013 2016 anand et al 2018a 2 3 1 model calibration and evaluation the global sensitivity analysis method in the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup software package abbaspour 2013 was used for sensitivity analysis and model calibration the inputs are the observed daily flow data the simulated flow and the most sensitive flow parameter in relation to flow with the absolute lower and upper bound and parameters value changing method predictive watershed models need to be calibrated using measured data for estimating the effectiveness of potential land management scenarios the model should also be tested without further parameter adjustment against an independent set of measured data validation the swat cup provides a decision making framework that incorporates a semi automated approach that incorporates sensitivity calibration and uncertainty analysis abbaspour 2013 the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 method of calibration and uncertainty analysis in the swat cup was used calibration and validation were performed by splitting the available observed data into a range of two datasets for each of the five gauged subbasins the selection of observed data periods for calibration and validation was based on the availability of relatively consistent observed data the most sensitive hydrologic parameters were used for calibration and their values were varied iteratively within the allowable upper and lower bounds until satisfactory agreements between measured and simulated streamflow were obtained the rigorous calibration process significantly improved the performance of model simulations a detail description of each of the hydrologic parameters is available in the swat model theoretical and input output documentation neitsch et al 2011 the model performance evaluation was undertaken to determine the reliability of prediction compared to the measured data using graphical inspection and goodness of fit measures during the calibration and validation periods which are indicated below from a to d as follows a the regression coefficient r2 r2 is the square of the pearson product moment correlation coefficient and indicates the proportion of the total variance in the observed data that can be explained by the model r2 value closer to 1 the higher is the agreement between the simulated and the measured flows and was calculated based on eq 1 b the nash and sutcliffe simulation efficiency ns ns indicates the degree of fitness of observed and simulated data and given by eq 2 nash and sutcliffe 1970 the value of ns ranges from 1 0 best to negative infinity the ns indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated value fits the 1 1 line c the percent bias pbias pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than their observed values for a given quantity over a specified period usually the entire calibration or validation period and calculated by eq 3 a value close to 0 is best for pbias moriasi et al 2007 d the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr standardizes rmse using the observations standard deviation rsr is

hydrological variability based on historical lc inputs lc 1974 1984 2000 and 2014 scenario analysis with respect to lc change is important to analyze the effect of plausible land management practices at a particular basin and subbasins where the impact of hydrologic variability on the society and ecosystem is mounting long term hydrologic simulation from the year 1983 2012 was made on a monthly and annual basis moreover the analysis of the impacts of lc change on the hydrologic variability was performed to evaluate the implication of lc change impact on the water balance components at different spatial and temporal scales the change between the historical lc categories was estimated by considering the relative difference between two consecutive periods of the lc maps and the corresponding simulated water balance components 2 4 partial least squares regression analysis of lc change impact on water balance components partial least squares regression plsr is a robust multivariate regression method that can be used to perform a wide range of analyses when the predictors exhibit collinearity shi et al 2013 plsr relates two data matrices x and y by a linear multivariate model each model parameter is estimated as the slope of a simple bivariate regression least squares between a matrix column or row as the y variable and another parameter vector as the x variable wold et al 2001 plsr technique provides the quantitative modeling of the complicated relationships between predictors and responses variable with complex problems wold et al 2001 detailed statistical background of plsr modeling can be found in the literature wold et al 2001 abdi 2003 tenenhaus et al 2005 plsris an extension of a multiple linear regression model in the simplest form a linear model specifies the relationship between a dependent variable y and a set of predictor variables x as shown in eq 5 5 y b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b p x p where b0 is the regression coefficient for the intercept and the bi values are the regression coefficients for variables 1 through p computed from the data the q² cumulated q2 cum index measures the global goodness of fit and the predictive quality of the models and sub models if there are several dependent variables the cross validated model quality index q2 percentage of variation explained by the explanatory variables and cross validated root mean squared error rmsecv between the predicted and observed values of each individual pass were calculated for each model the search for the maximum of the q²cum index is equivalent to finding the most stable model in the plsr modeling the importance of a predictor for the dependent variables is indicated by the variable importance in the projection vip yan et al 2013 the factors with high vip values of more than 1 are the most relevant in explaining the dependent variable and are considered to be significantly influential predictors of the plsr model shi et al 2013 ai et al 2015 li et al 2017 wold 1995 suggests vip value more than 0 8 is most relevant and significant for explaining the dependent variable and vip less than 0 5 are considered to be of minor importance for the prediction of dependent variables the vip and regression coefficients were used to explain the relative influence of each independent variable it is thus possible to determine the individual lc classes predictor variables which strongly interact with the corresponding water balance components the dependent variable the vip values provide information on the strength of influence for each predictor and the regression coefficients give the direction of the influence onderka et al 2012 the relationships between the predictors and the response variables can also be inferred from the plsr weights w woldesenbet et al 2017 it shows not only the magnitude but also the direction of influences negative or positive effect the main originality of plsr is to preserve the asymmetry of the relationship between predictors and dependent variables whereas other techniques treat them symmetrically abdi 2003 in the present paper the vip value was used to infer the most important lc classes which affect the particular water balance components in the upper awash basin the plsr model was used to evaluate the relationship between the changes in annual water balance components and particular lc classes the change in the lc maps of 1974 1984 2000 and 2014 and mean annual water balance components simulated based on each lc maps were used in the present study the plsr model analysis was performed using xlstat software excel add ins statistical tool www xlstat com the stepwise methodology of the study is summarized in fig 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 land cover lc change detection the lc change analysis in the past decades from the year 1974 2014 depicted that cropland was the main lc class followed by shrubland and forest areas the lc change detections between consecutive study periods revealed a continuous increment in the spatial extent of cropland and urban areas and the changes were also projected to intensify in the near future shawul and chakma 2019 the total area of cropland escalated from 49 0 in 1974 to 72 1 in 2014 in contrary shrubland was shrunk from 22 3 in 1974 to 15 9 in 2014 as shown in table 5 and fig 4 a to d the higher trend of expansion of urban areas was observed in the mid northern part of the basin in akaki subbasin mainly due to the encroachment of addis ababa and the surrounding towns as a result the urban area in the whole basin increased from 0 4 in 1974 to 2 9 in 2014 and it is expected to increase due to the higher population growth rate and socio economic development in the region a further rise in urban areas due to the higher population influx and the rapid socio economic development in addis ababa and adjacent cities inevitably reduce the areas of natural vegetation and cropland which may also lead to the relocation of croplands to the nearest possible regions the pasture forests and shrubland coverage were diminished throughout the selected historical periods forest and shrubland areas mainly sustained at the higher land slope terrains in the upstream parts of the basin bewket 2002 also found that large areas of forest shrubland and pasture lands were converted to agricultural and settlements due to the higher rate population growth in the highlands regions of ethiopia as a result of the dynamics in the lc the hydrologic process could be significantly altered the relative change in the urban areas was found to increase by 606 2 from 49km2 in the year 1974 to more than 343km2 in 2014 studies such as mengistu 2009 have also found similar results that large area of forest shrubland and pasture was altered to cropland and urban lands cropland expansion is the primary driver of deforestation and loss of natural vegetation in ethiopia due to a drastic increase in rural and urban populations teferi et al 2013 hailu et al 2015 kindu et al 2015 it can be seen that pasture coverage area is declined from 19 6 in 1974 to 2 5 in 2014 and also forest coverage decreased from 7 1 in 1974 to 5 3 in 2014 the huge loss of pasture grassland and forest area and the increase in cropland areas between 1974 and 1984 could be primarily attributed to change of the government system which has brought the new land reforms kindu et al 2015 further discussed the ethiopian government change in 1974 which involved the land to the tillers the 1975 land reform proclamation which allowed local peasants to have better access to land for cultivation consequently the cropland area largely increased from 49 0 in 1974 to 67 1 in 1984 at the expense of natural vegetation cover the lc classification accuracy has met the requirement indicated in congalton 1991 which is sufficient for land cover map mainly the overall accuracy was found to be 80 6 84 5 86 5 and 89 2 for the lc year 1974 1984 2000 and 2014 and the kappa coefficients of 0 76 0 81 0 83 and 0 87 for example table 2 highlights the user s accuracy producer s accuracy overall accuracy and kappa coefficients derived from the confusion matrix of the classified land cover map of lc 2014 and ground truth reference data waterbody was the most accurately classified lc classes with 100 0 user s and procedure s accuracy in general the overall accuracy and kappa coefficients lc classification accuracy assessment demonstrated strong agreement between the classified lc classes and ground truth values additional details about the historical and near future lc change analysis and the main drivers of lc change in the upper awash basin are provided by shawul and chakma 2019 3 2 calibration and validation of the swat model sensitivity analysis and model calibration were performed at five main gauging stations in the upper awash basin namely hombole melka kuntre mojo akaki and teji subbasins using the swat cup calibration and uncertainty analysis tool for each model runs the first three years of simulations were considered as model warm up period the most sensitive hydrologic parameters were used for the model calibration and validation processes the surface runoff parameters such as a cn2 mgt a sol awc sol a sol k sol and v ch k2 rte were more effective parameters to change in streamflow the baseflow parameters such as v alpha bf gw v gwqmn gw v revapmn gw v rchrg dp gw v gw delay gw and v gw revap gw were found to be more sensitive parameters for all subbasins as shown in table 3 moreover parameters that affect the lateral flow such as r lat ttime hru r slsoil hru and r slsubbsn hru were considered in the calibration processes to correct the delay in the monthly peak values the hydrologic parameter values were varied iteratively within the allowable ranges until satisfactory agreements between measured and simulated streamflow are obtained independently at each gauged subbasins rigorous model calibration efforts have improved the model performance for hydrologic simulations the swat model performance was evaluated by comparing the observed and simulated discharge series the simulated and observed streamflow hydrograph indicated the model captured the patterns of hydrologic variability both at calibration and validation period which proved the swat model to be capable of simulating the hydrologic processes in the upper awash basin a comparable result was obtained between mean monthly observed and simulated discharges in cubic meters per second cms at calibration and validation periods at all gauged subbasins as shown in table 4 the difference in the mean monthly discharge was maintained below 1 0 cms except at hombole subbasins 1 82 cms for the calibration period the mean monthly simulated values in the validation period showed slightly overestimation of the observed discharge at all stations mainly at melka kuntre hombole and akaki subbasins moreover very good model performance was obtained at hombole and melka kuntre subbasins with ns and r2 0 8 pbias 5 and rsr 0 50 for the calibration period good to very good model performance was obtained at mojo akaki and teji subbasins with ns and r2 0 65 pbias 15 and rsr 0 60 at calibration period satisfactory to very good model performance rating was obtained based on the mentioned model efficiency criteria at the discharge sites for the validation periods however overestimation of the monthly lower peak discharge in the belg season march april and may and underestimation of higher monthly peak values in the main rainfall kiremt season june july and august was observed the swat model underestimation of flow during peak rainy months and overestimation during the low flow conditions were also reported in studies gassman et al 2007 shawul et al 2016 woldesenbet et al 2017 the possible explanation for the inconsistency of model simulation of peak events could be due to lack of sufficient consideration of the rainfall intensity on runoff generation in the cn method which is used in the swat model zhang et al 2019 in addition to the model structure model assumptions limitations uncertainty from lack of consistent quality of temporal and spatial data including soil data land management data related to small scale irrigation application can be responsible for the slight discrepancy in the model simulation overall based on the visual inspection of time series graphs shown in fig 5 a to e as well as the statistical measures of the model performance evaluation met the criteria recommended in santhi et al 2001 moriasi et al 2007 both at calibration and validation periods thus the swat model can be considered as an appropriate tool for simulating the hydrological variability and plausible watershed management scenarios in the upper awash basin 3 3 impact of land cover lc change on the hydrologic processes in the upper awash basin 3 3 1 hydrological impact of lc change at the basin level the impact of land cover lc change on the hydrologic components mainly on the surface runoff surfq lateral flow latq groundwater flow gwq and actual evapotranspiration et in the upper awash river basin were analyzed on the mean annual basis the annual water balance components were based on four independent simulations using lc 1974 lc 1984 lc 2000 and lc 2014 to illustrate the spatial and temporal variability in the basin the change in annual basin values relative to lc indicated higher fluctuation of surfq and latq as compared to the change in gwq and et values as shown in table 5 on average the recent lc 2014 yields higher surfq and lower gwq and latq as compared to the earlier historical lc data the intensification of cropland and urban areas and removal of forests shrubland and pasture increases the average surfq marhaento et al 2017 have also argued that an increase in the settlement area has contributed to a higher ratio of surface runoff to streamflow and a lower ratio of groundwater flow the percentage change in annual water balance components between lc 1974 and 1984 shows a 9 06 increase in depth of surfq a 16 3 decrease in latq 0 1 decrease in gwq and 0 98 reduction in et conversion of forest and shrubland to cropland results in the decrease of et and consequently increases surface runoff legesse et al 2003 the increase in cropland area as well as the reduction of vegetation cover have triggered the increase of surface runoff the 1974 1984 period of the analysis revealed the lc change was mainly due to a higher increase in cropland 18 1 and massive loss in vegetation cover such as pasture 14 0 consequently latq diminished by 16 4 and surfq increased by 9 0 whereas negligible response was obtained to change in gwq 0 1 and et 1 0 in the same period between 1974 and 1984 as shown in table 5 schilling et al 2008 also discussed that increasing crop production mainly corn crop at the expense of grasslands will increase the surface runoff decrease annual et and ultimately increase the water yield which may also lead to more sediment loss from the watershed interestingly improvement in the area coverage of forest from 3 2 in 2000 to 5 3 in 2014 and pasture coverage area from the lowest coverage nearly 0 9 in 2000 to 2 9 in 2014 was observed the main attributable explanation for the increase of vegetation cover in the 2000 2014 period could be due to the government initiatives of climate resilient and low carbon strategies through large scale land rehabilitation afforestation and agroforestry practices to reduce the pressure on forest resources fdre 2011 however it resulted in an insignificant effect on the annual basin values due to the contrasting effect of the increase in cropland and urban and reduction in shrubland generally the 40 year period of lc change analysis is characterized by significant increase in cropland and reduction in forest shrubland and pasture between 1974 and 2014 and resulted in 18 4 increment in the depth of surfq while the latq gwq and et decreased by 24 0 2 1 and 0 1 respectively the series of annual and seasonal water balance simulated between the years 1983 and 2012 based on the four historical lc change reveals higher variations as shown in fig 6 a the annual and seasonal surface runoff mm and the percent change simulated based on lc 1974 lc 1984 lc 2000 and lc 2014 revealed in increasing trend between each consecutive period of lc change input on the contrary the lateral flow and groundwater flow exhibited decreasing trends the lateral flow as shown in fig 6b mainly diminished between lc 1974 and lc 1984 due to a higher percentage of area loss in pasture shrubland and forest cover within the same period an increase in cropland leads to decrease in the infiltration capacity of the soil as a result of soil compaction which triggers more surface runoff and reduces lateral flow and gw flow moreover the reduction in forest land decreases et value hence more water will be available as surface runoff and total water yield similarly the annual and seasonal groundwater flow exhibits decrement with the recent lc data however the magnitude of change was negligible for groundwater flow as shown in fig 6c a rise in the depth of surface runoff was obtained for lc 2014 due to the rapid expansion and encroachment of urban and cropland areas as the result of the socio economic development and higher area loss in indigenous vegetation cover in the upper awash basin in addition to climate variability and lc changes mainly deforestation and urbanization the slope variation soil types and geological conditions could contribute to the impact of land use change on the water balances bruijnzeel 2004 marhaento et al 2017 a closer look at the figure also revealed the relative change in the annual surfq latq and gwq demonstrate higher change in 1974 1984 and 2000 2014 period whereas the change between years 1984 2000 is relatively lower for example the mean annual change in surfq increased by 10 0 between lc 1974 lc 1984 3 1 between lc 1984 lc 2000 and 6 6 between lc 2000 lc 2014 the change in mean annual latq also exhibited a higher magnitude of change in the lc 1974 lc 1984 period which was reduced by 14 lc 1984 lc 2000 by 0 6 and lc 2000 lc 2014 by 6 0 the change in the mean annual gwq was also decreasing but the magnitude of change was relatively lower for example the rate of change was found to be 0 1 in lc 1974 lc 1984 2 4 in lc 1984 lc 2000 and 0 6 in lc 2000 lc 2014 unlike surfq and latq the rate of change in gwq shows higher magnitude in 1984 2000 period it indicates that the gwq values are more responsive to change in forest and urban areas as shown in table 5 further higher rate of change in the area of forest and urban coverage was obtained in 1984 2000 period moreover the average seasonal variability of hydrologic components due to lc change was evaluated based on four main rainfall seasons namely summer seasons jja the autumn season son the spring season mam and the winter season djf as shown in fig 6 the impact of lc change is more pronounced in the wet months in the summer season more than 52 of the surfq amount occurs during the summer season which is considered the wettest season and 19 of the surfq amount in the year occurs during the spring season which is considered to be the intermediate season in terms of wetness winter season is a dry season in terms of rainfall amount which accounts for a total annual rainfall of 7 7 in the upper awash basin the seasonal water balance anomalies due to lc change between the years 1974 and 2014 exhibited a decrement in the latq and gwq throughout all seasons and increment in the surfq as shown in the seasonal bar plot in fig 6a to c higher loss of pasture shrubland and forest area between lc 1974 and lc 1984 resulted in a higher increment of surfq in agreement with this study zhou et al 2013 have also indicated that in terms of seasonal variations of hydrological fluxes the impact of lc change on streamflow was more during the wet season and a relatively smaller change in the dry season 3 3 2 hydrological impact of lc change at the subbasin level the subbasins level mean annual surfq and gwq in relation to the change in the area of land cover class in the four main gauged subbasins hombole melka kuntre akaki and mojo demonstrated higher variations between lc year 1974 and 2014 as shown in fig 7 a b c and d respectively the subbasins which experienced higher loss of forest shrubland and pasture to cropland received increments in the surfq and total water yield and decrement in gwq and et akaki subbasin which is mainly categorized by a higher urban growth due to expansion of addis ababa city and a larger decrease in pasture and shrubland area experienced a larger increase in the surfq more than 75 83 mm increment of the depth of surfq was obtained whereas the gwq diminished by 9 6 in the akaki subbasin birhanu et al 2018 also stated higher fluctuations of surface and groundwater resources in the akaki subbasin is triggering significant pressure on the water supply and recurrent flooding in the nearby areas higher anomalies in the surfq and gwq were also observed in the hombole melka kuntre and mojo subbasins due to the alteration of the significant amount of shrubland forest and pasture land to cropland between the year 1974 and 2014 mango et al 2011 also concluded that the conversion of forest to agricultural lands have increased the overland flow and reduced the base flow amount however in the mojo subbasin surfq and gwq revealed positive change between lc 1974 and lc 2014 the change cropland area at the mentioned periods was smaller 8 at mojo subbasin as compared to other subbasins which have relatively larger increase in cropland moreover in both time periods 1974 and 2014 cropland was the dominant lc classes that have more than 80 area coverage in the mojo subbasin the hydrologic response of river basins at multiple spatial scales can highlight the vulnerable subbasins or reaches due to the extent of lc change which may help to prioritize the efforts for plausible land management practices to maintain the healthy functioning of watershed processes the spatial variations of hydrologic components due to lc change at subbasins level a total of 77 subbasins in the upper awash basin were analyzed considering the relative difference between four separate hydrologic simulations forced by lc 1974 and lc 1984 and between lc 2000 and lc 2014 the impacts of lc changes were more pronounced at the subbasin level because of the contrasting effects are not averaged by lc variations contained in the whole basin the subbasins level impact of lc change on hydrologic parameters namely scs curve number cn surface runoff surfq groundwater flow gwq and actual evapotranspiration et was found to be higher than the whole basin level as shown in fig 8 a and b the positive and negative lc change impact on water balance component at smaller subbasin level could compensate each other at the larger basin level thus the complexity of large heterogeneous basins might obscure the implications of lc changes on water balance at the local scale wilk and hughes 2002 wagner et al 2013 schilling et al 2014 marhaento et al 2017 the basin wide average change in the hydrologic process due to lc change indicated that the cn as 1 86 surfq as 6 31 gwq as 3 62 and et as 0 46 between lc 1974 and lc 1984 furthermore the change between lc 2000 and lc 2014 shows an increase in the cn by 2 53 and surfq by 8 99 a decrease in the gwq by 2 59 and et by 1 72 the subbasin level impact of lc change is higher than the basin scale and it was also found that lc change impacts on water balance at the outlets of the large scale basins are less significant than in the smaller subbasins the subbasins level change in the surfq was found to be in the range of 42 6 to 100 0 between lc 1974 and lc1984 similarly higher change in gwq was also observed in the subbasin as compared to the mean basin values as shown in fig 8 spatial scales have significant role in determining the magnitude of hydrologic change for example the impact of agroforestry was larger for the smaller subbasins as compared with the entire river basin mwangi et al 2016 subbasins which have experienced larger increments of cropland and urban area received relatively larger value of cn and surfq and contrasting effect to the gwq values subbasins in the downstream area which have relatively plain topography experienced a higher rate of increase in the cropland as a result surfq highly increased while et and gwq decrease at the same time wilk and hughes 2002 also found that converting forest and savanna to agriculture increases runoff whereas conversion of other lc to forest largely decreases runoff amount 3 3 3 the relative contribution of lc change on water balance components based on partial least squares regression plsr model the annual basin values of important water balance components were generated from 1983 to 2012 years of simulations the correlation matrix indicated in table 6 shows the correlations among the explanatory variables lc classes the dependent variables water balance components and between both groups of variables the correlation coefficient cc revealed that the annual surface runoff surfq was highly attributed to change in the area of cropland and urban land with a cc value of 0 94 and 0 90 respectively similarly the change in water yield was positively attributed to increase in cropland and urban areas on the contrary the lateral flow latq and groundwater flow gwq was inversely related to change in the area of cropland and urban which resulted in negative cc values the forest and shrubland contribute more evapotranspiration et per unit area however the mean annual value indicates et was the least affected water balance components by the lc change which was found to have lower cc values positive relationships were observed between the change in the forest pasture waterbody shrubland areas and groundwater flow parameters in other words the change in natural vegetation covers such as dense forest shrubland and pasture was negatively correlated with surfq which implied that improving the vegetation cover on the hillside and abandoned land area could help to reduce the direct surface runoff in the upper awash basin minimizing the surface runoff amount is vital to reduce the recurring flooding and sedimentation problems in the awash basin urban and cultivated areas are the main contributor to the change in the water yield surface runoff and et including a reduction in the shallow and deep aquifer recharges the intensification of urban and cultivated lands as the key environmental stressor which significantly affects water balance components of a basin anand et al 2018b the result from plsr model constructed for the annual water balance components surfq latq gwq et and wtrq is presented in table 7 including r² mse rmse q² q² cum percent of explained variability and cumulative percentage of explained variability in the response variables based on the available data series the plsr model automatically generated two model components comp1 and comp2 the two plsr components are generally sufficient for a limited number of products and the choice of two components allows convenient graphical analysis tenenhaus et al 2005 the cumulative explained variations in y and q² cum that corresponds to the correlations between the explanatory x variable and dependent y variables with the components are close to 1 with two components this indicates the two plsr components summarize well both the x and the y variables the first plsr component explained 97 7 of the variability in the surfq 94 3 in the latq and 90 7 in the gwq the cumulative explained variance for the second component of all y variables was higher more than 98 the addition of the second plsr component substantially improved the variance explained in the y variables the plot of the correlation circle indicated in fig 9 provides a graphical display of the x and y variables using the correlation coefficient of the two plsr components on t1 and t2 axes it provides a summarized view of the relationship between the model variables in the form of monoplot the circle in the correlation plot represents the regression coefficient r² 1 0 the length of line to the circle indicates how well the variables are represented whereas a shorter line that appears nearer to the center of the circle within r² 0 2 are said to be not well represented by the variables the angle between the vectors is the estimate of the correlation between the variables the cosine of the angle between these lines gives the correlation coefficient a small angle indicates the variables are positively correlated whereas an angle of 90 degrees indicates the variables are not correlated and the angle close to 180 degrees indicates the variables are negatively correlated tenenhaus et al 2005 the monoplot exhibits that the change in cropland directly influenced the surface runoff and the area of cropland is inversely correlated to the groundwater flow and lateral flow interestingly from the correlation map it can be observed that forest is strongly correlated with groundwater and pasture and shrubland are highly correlated with the change in lateral flow it also appears that the et value is less impacted by the lc changes on an annual basis in the upper awash basin however the subbasins level impact of lc change on et was higher than the basin wide level as shown in fig 8a and b gashaw et al 2018 also determined that the influence of lc change on et is minimal especially on the monthly average values the impact of lc change and climate variability was higher on annual et in the watersheds where the expansion of forest plantations is higher compared to other watersheds berihun et al 2019 as urban area increases there will be more impervious soils which in turn increase the surface runoff thereby increases the total water yield of the basin consequently a strong correlation between the urban area and water yield was obtained furthermore it can be deduced from the monoplot that correlation among x or predictor variables that cropland is negatively correlated with pasture shrubland forest and waterbody the variable importance for the projection vips of each explanatory variable for two components allows for identifying the explanatory variables that contribute the most to the models the plot of the correlation circle indicates how important the individual lc classes on the variability of annual basin values however the vip values can provide a more comprehensive expression of the relative importance of predictors values vip 1 and or vip 0 8 based on wold s criteria indicate that the predictor variable is considered to be significantly important to the corresponding dependent variable moreover the plsr weight w gives a more specific and a fair idea of the sign and the relative weight of the corresponding coefficients in the model the squares of w values more than 0 2 i e w2 0 2 indicated that the plsr components are mainly weighted on the corresponding variables the bold faced values shown in table 8 exhibits the plsr component is considered to be more important to the response variables for example for surfq the higher vip 1 21 was obtained by cropland followed by pasture and urban land each with vip value of vip 1 15 and shrubland with vip 0 87 in addition the w value shows the direction of influence that the lc class has on the corresponding water balance components the amount of surfq is inversely related to pasture land w 0 47 whereas it is directly related to change in cropland w 0 49 and urban area w 0 47 the highest vip value for latq was obtained for cropland vip 1 3 w 0 53 for pasture vip 1 23 w 0 5 and for urban vip 1 07 w 0 44 similarly the gwq was more impacted by expansion of urban area vip 1 34 w 0 55 and forest area vip 1 04 w 0 47 noticeably the expansion of urban area and cropland increases the surface runoff it inversely impacts the latq and gwq and vice versa however the change in the area of forest pasture and shrubland has a negative correlation with surfq which implies that an increase in vegetation covers would significantly reduce the surface runoff this result is in agreement with earlier studies such as shi et al 2013 zeinivand and nourmohammadi 2017 in which the forest area was negatively related to the surface runoff amount and sediment yield forests contribute more to the evapotranspiration et per unit area than other lc classes such as cropland and pasture thus deforestation leads to a decrease in the annual et value consequently the amount of surface runoff increases woldesenbet et al 2017 have also reported that deforestation and the expansion of cultivated land in the subbasins resulted in the reduction of et but increased surface runoff and groundwater components however the plrs output revealed unclear relationships between lc changes and et it shows et is inversely correlated with forest and change in a water body which was expected to be positively correlated a number of factor can affect the simulated et values such as the swat model limitations of plant growth module in modeling trees and perennial plants in the tropics van griensven et al 2012 strauch and volk 2013 mwangi et al 2016 where rainfall is the dominant plant growth factor than temperature alemayehu et al 2017 moreover limitations due to lack of relevant weather data other than precipitation and temperature which are responsible for the estimation of et could also be attributed to the unlikely response of et the vip values which are indicated in fig 10 a to e for the first plsr component 95 confidence interval of the six predictor variables lc classes used in the plsr model shows the most important contributor to change in the annual basin values it allows identifying the variables that mainly contribute to the difference in the specific water balance component the horizontal dashed lines were drawn based on the threshold value of vip larger than 0 8 and 1 0 for example three out of six variables cropland urban and pasture have vip greater than 1 threshold thus the variables were considered more critical to the surfq as shown in fig 10a yan et al 2013 have also indicated that change in the farmland and urban area poses greater influence in the variability of streamflow and sediment yield it was observed that pasture and cropland have a lower influence on et whereas forest shrubland urban and water body have more contribution to the annual et values in the upper awash basin moreover the increase in the urban and the decline of forest area more significantly contribute to change in the gwq the result also shows that change in the shrubland exerts less influence on the annual gwq future research on the application of the plsr model on the importance of land uses and land management practices on the hydrologic variability will help to provide a thorough understanding of the watershed processes which is vital for water management interventions 4 conclusions assessment of the impact of land cover lc change on the hydrologic variability at multiple spatial and temporal scales highlight the vulnerable subbasins which are vital for planning sound watershed management interventions this paper examines the influence of lc change on the water balance components using integrated approaches of remote sensing hydrologic modeling and partial least squares regression plsr modeling in the upper awash basin the efficiency of the swat model simulation was evaluated at five main gauged subbasins and the model was capable of predicting the hydrologic variability in the upper awash basin the lc change analysis during the past half century mainly revealed a considerable decline in the coverage of forest pasture and shrubland due to the swelling increase of agriculture and settlement areas as a result relocation of cropland to proximate marginally suitable high slope terrains and removal of the forest and shrubland would pose an adverse impact which triggers an imbalance in the hydrologic components of the basin the impact of lc change is highly pronounced at small scale subbasins than at the whole basin level thus assessment of lc change impacts on hydrologic processes should be done in a sufficient spatial and temporal detail at subbasins level to identify the more impacted areas the shift from the indigenous forest shrubland and pasture to cultivation and urban land caused a relatively significant increase in the surface runoff and total water yield and decreasing trend in lateral flow groundwater flow and actual evapotranspiration the correlation matrix among lc classes and annual water balance components revealed that the surface runoff was highly attributed to change in the area of cropland and urban land with a higher correlation coefficient cc value of 0 94 and 0 90 lateral flow and groundwater flow were inversely correlated with change in the area of cropland and urban which resulted in higher negative cc values based on the plsr correlation plot it can be concluded that forest is strongly correlated with groundwater flow and pasture and shrubland are highly correlated with the change in lateral flow moreover the value of vip 1 and the square of w 0 2 indicates the plsr components are mainly weighted on the corresponding variables which signify the lc classes as a more influential variable to the corresponding water balance components the basin scale mean annual et value was less responsive to lc change as compared to other water balance components mainly changes in cropland and urban area have a negative influence on the groundwater flow and the increase in the forest area could significantly enhance groundwater flow the findings of this study provided valuable information on the relative influence of particular land use to improve a specific water balance component which is vital for planning sustainable water resources management interventions reforestation of degraded high slope terrains could enhance groundwater recharge and reduce surface runoff thereby improves the water balance of the basin future studies should consider the improvement of the swat model capability to simulate peak runoff and evapotranspiration mainly in tropical areas the high level of land competition between different sectors should be managed through the regulation of unplanned urban and agricultural expansions furthermore appropriate policy measures should be implemented to ensure sustainable water resources management and to improve the

hydrologic modeling and partial least squares regression plsr provides better understandings of the impact of recent development activities on water resources the swat model was validated at five subbasins and used to simulate the water balance and hydrologic response to lc changes at multiple temporal and spatial scales plsr was used to evaluate the significance of the relative influence of lc classes on the hydrologic components new hydrological insights for the region based on the multitemporal lc change detections upper awash basin is characterized by the decline of natural vegetation due to the swelling rise of cropland and urbanization the monoplot of plsr components exhibited that groundwater is highly correlated with the forest areas and lateral flow is strongly correlated with pasture whereas surface runoff is significantly attributed to the change in urban and cropland the variable importance for the projection vip and plsr weight w revealed that the decline of groundwater is mainly due to urban vip 1 34 and w 0 55 whereas the change in forest area enhanced groundwater vip 1 04 and w 0 47 the study provides valuable information on the contribution of particular lc to change in water balance which is vital for improved water resources management keywords land cover change water balance component partial least squares regression swat model upper awash basin 1 introduction hydrologic responses to land use land cover lc changes and land management practices are the integrated indicators of the watershed conditions a holistic understanding of the complex and dynamic land surface and its interacting parts is required to make precise predictions of the future water balance feyen and raul 2011 the rapid lc change coupled with climate variability could potentially lead to an increase in hydrologic impacts ewen and parkin 1996 chen and bofu 2013 quantitative assessment of the impact of climate and lc changes on water resource availability is a significant issue for hydrological science yin et al 2017 knowledge of the distribution and types of lc are essential for resource base analysis on land degradation land productivity and its impacts on water resources solomon 1994 bewket 2002 amsalu et al 2007 hence comprehensive and improved procedures that integrate different techniques such as remote sensing hydrologic modeling and statistical approaches are necessary to identify the influence of lc change and land management practices on the hydrological variability of a river basin the rising water demands in the awash river basin due to the booming population growth rate and the socio economic developments are increasing the competition among various water users within subbasins which led the water resources under tremendous pressure chekol 2006 adeba et al 2015 mersha et al 2018 to meet these challenges on water resources management quantification of lc change impact at subbasins and basin scale hydrology are essential understanding the likely effects of lc change in the runoff variability and determining whether these issues can be treated at the source through sustainable land management practices are urgent research needs the future lc change can compromise the water resources and hydrologic water balance which directly affects local communities the biota and possible water management plans abe et al 2018 dos santos et al 2018 the socio economic importance that the awash river offers to the central and eastern parts of ethiopia in particular and the whole nation in general is noteworthy thus a practical understanding of the potential impact of lc change on hydrologic variability should be attained to implement sustainable water resources management plans legesse et al 2003 griffis and stedinger 2008 degraded watersheds tend to accelerate the overland flow which reduces the soil moisture and groundwater recharge various studies used land cover mapping tools and methods to understand lc changes inventory of forest and natural resources as well as understand the changes in the hydrologic behavior of watersheds melesse and jordan 2003 bewket and sterk 2004 mengistu 2009 melesse et al 2009 mango et al 2011 marhaento et al 2017 woldesenbet et al 2017 anand et al 2018b investigating the impact of lc change on the hydrologic processes at subbasins level allows to define the degree of susceptibility of local water resources and helps to plan appropriate mitigation measures that must be taken ahead of time the impacts of agricultural land management practices and lc change scenarios on the water balance are more evident at local subbasin scales however evidence for basin scale impacts is limited wilk and hughes 2002 schilling et al 2014 anand et al 2018b several lc classes carry significant roles and influences on the hydrologic processes mainly on the runoff sedimentation and extreme hydrologic events bahremand 2006 the partial least squares regressions plsr statistical method is particularly well suited to analyze the complex interaction of large array of predictor and dependent variables carrascal et al 2009 the plsr is a new technique which is particularly suitable for multivariate problems when the number of observations is less than the number of possible predictors and when the variables exhibit collinearity wold et al 2001 carrascal et al 2009 onderka et al 2012 shi et al 2013 fang et al 2015 plsr is particularly useful when there is a need to predict a set of dependent variables water balance components from a large set of independent variables land cover types abdi 2003 the integrated approaches of hydrologic modeling using the soil and water assessment tool swat model and plsr analysis can be used to evaluate the relative impact of change in the lc classes on the hydrologic components integrated approaches of hydrologic modeling and statistical analysis to assess the impact of anthropogenic activities on water balance components mainly the relative impact of different lc classes on hydrologic processes is not well studied therefore the objectives of this study are i to simulate the impact of lc change on the hydrologic variability at the subbasins and basin scale and ii to evaluate the relative contributions of change in lc classes on the water balance components based on plsr model in the upper awash basin ethiopia analysis of the hydrologic response of a basin at multiple scales in subbasins can highlight the vulnerable river reaches or subbasins due to the extent of lc change which could help to execute integrated water resources management within the particular subbasin 2 materials and methods 2 1 location of the study area the awash basin is situated between latitudes 7 53 n and 12 n and longitudes of 37 57 e and 43 25 e this study was undertaken in the upper awash basin at the headwater of awash river basin which lies between latitudes 8 16 and 9 18 and longitudes 37 57 and 39 17 as shown in fig 1 the total drainage area of the upper awash basin is estimated to be 11 720 km2 at the outlet of koka reservoir elevations range between 3565 to 1560 m above sea level and the major urban centers of the country such as addis ababa adama and bishoftu are located within the upper awash basin 2 2 model input and data sources 2 2 1 climate data the daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation wind speed and relative humidity were collected mainly from the national meteorological service agency of ethiopia nmsa for stations located within the study basin the missing rainfall data were estimated using the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method the rainfall data were obtained from 30 different stations which are indicated in fig 1 and the majority of stations demonstrated peak monthly rainfall patterns in july and august the inter annual variability of rainfall in belg season march may as well as the kiremt rainfall season june august occasionally lead to large scale droughts and floods in the awash river basin nmsa 2001 korecha and sorteberg 2013 moreover the mean monthly maximum and minimum temperature profiles indicated that most of the climate stations demonstrated similar rainfall patterns the spatial variability of mean annual rainfall exhibits larger values in the northern and western part at the upstream of the upper awash basin as shown in the spatially interpolated map in fig 2 b in contrast the higher maximum and minimum temperature were obtained at the southeastern part of the basin fig 2c and d mainly the highest average maximum temperature was recorded at koka station as 32 5 c in may at the downstream part of the basin the lowest average minimum temperature was found to be 6 06 c at addis ababa station in november at the upstream area 2 2 2 hydrological data the instantaneous daily river discharge data for main gauged subbasins were obtained from the ministry of water irrigation and energy ethiopia mowie http mowie gov et observed daily monthly and annual discharge data are required for model calibration and validation the hydrologic year which consists of significant outliers in the data series were not considered from further application for hydrologic modeling thus data periods with relatively consistent data series were taken systematically for model evaluation and comparison 2 2 3 soil properties basic physicochemical properties of major soil types were mainly obtained from the following sources soil database and digital soil map from the mowe harmonized world soil database http webarchive iiasa ac at research luc external world soil database html nachtergaele et al 2010 major soils of the world fao 2002 some soil properties which were not available in the databases such as saturated hydraulic conductivity was estimated based on pedotransfer functions from the readily available data rawls et al 1982 the fao soil classification was used to define the soil type and 12 different soil types were classified as a result 51 of the majority of the basin area is covered by eutric vertisols 11 of vertic cambisols 10 5 humic nitosols and 9 77 chromic luvisols as shown in fig 2a eutric vertisols largely cover in the middle and western part of the basin mostly on the flood plain areas 2 2 4 digital elevation model dem the dem was used to analyze the drainage patterns of the land surface terrain dem with 30 m spatial resolution was used which was obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm as shown in fig 1 the land slope class indicates that 54 2 area is between slope class of 0 10 30 7 between 10 20 and the remaining 15 1 is above 20 land slope class which shows the prevalence higher topographic variations in the upper awash basin 2 2 5 land use land cover lc data the land cover lc dataset for the four historical periods was developed from multi temporal series of landsat images the landsat images were obtained from the united states geological survey usgs earth explorer website http earthexplorer usgs gov for the years 1974 of landsat multispectral scanner mss years 1984 thematic mapper tm year 2000 enhanced thematic mapper etm and year 2014 landsat 8 the operational land imager oli the necessary procedures of land cover image classification were performed using erdas imagine erdas 2013 https www hexagongeospatial com the supervised classification method was applied using the maximum likelihood classification technique hord 1982 the lc classification methods were applied by defining signature files and assigning the number of lc classes post classification analysis was carried out using arcgis toolboxes https www esri com the lc dataset was aggregated to six different lc classes with its respective four letter swat code namely cropland agriculture agrl dense forest frse shrubland mixed forest frst pasture past urban high density urhd and waterbody watr 2 3 hydrologic model setup and simulation the soil and water assessment tool swat model is semi distributed physically based computationally efficient and capable of continuous simulation over long periods arnold et al 1998 2012 gassman et al 2007 the main hydrological components simulated in the land phase of the hydrological cycle are evapotranspiration lateral subsurface flow groundwater flow surface runoff ponds canopy storage infiltration redistribution tributary channels and return flow swat simulates the land phase of the hydrological cycle based on the water balance equation neitsch et al 2011 swat model simulates the surface runoff volumes and peak runoff rates using the soil conservation service scs curve number cn usda scs 1972 for each of the hydrologic response unit hru using daily rainfall data the hru analysis in swat includes the delineation of hrus by overlaying the spatial map of slope classes land use and soil data hru is the smallest area representation in the swat model which comprises of unique land use soil type and slope parameters hydrologic simulations on the hru level helps to visualize the spatial variation of water balance components of the basin at a relatively smaller area which is vital for planning watershed interventions a total of 77 subbasins were delineated in the upper awash basin the more detailed information about swat model input output documentation theoretical backgrounds software and literature databases are available at https swat tamu edu the swat model application for prediction of streamflow as well as evaluation of the impact of land use land cover and climate change on the hydrology of different watersheds were documented by various studies setegn et al 2009 2011 mango et al 2011 getachew and melesse 2012 dessu and melesse 2013 shawul et al 2013 2016 anand et al 2018a 2 3 1 model calibration and evaluation the global sensitivity analysis method in the swat calibration and uncertainty program swat cup software package abbaspour 2013 was used for sensitivity analysis and model calibration the inputs are the observed daily flow data the simulated flow and the most sensitive flow parameter in relation to flow with the absolute lower and upper bound and parameters value changing method predictive watershed models need to be calibrated using measured data for estimating the effectiveness of potential land management scenarios the model should also be tested without further parameter adjustment against an independent set of measured data validation the swat cup provides a decision making framework that incorporates a semi automated approach that incorporates sensitivity calibration and uncertainty analysis abbaspour 2013 the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 method of calibration and uncertainty analysis in the swat cup was used calibration and validation were performed by splitting the available observed data into a range of two datasets for each of the five gauged subbasins the selection of observed data periods for calibration and validation was based on the availability of relatively consistent observed data the most sensitive hydrologic parameters were used for calibration and their values were varied iteratively within the allowable upper and lower bounds until satisfactory agreements between measured and simulated streamflow were obtained the rigorous calibration process significantly improved the performance of model simulations a detail description of each of the hydrologic parameters is available in the swat model theoretical and input output documentation neitsch et al 2011 the model performance evaluation was undertaken to determine the reliability of prediction compared to the measured data using graphical inspection and goodness of fit measures during the calibration and validation periods which are indicated below from a to d as follows a the regression coefficient r2 r2 is the square of the pearson product moment correlation coefficient and indicates the proportion of the total variance in the observed data that can be explained by the model r2 value closer to 1 the higher is the agreement between the simulated and the measured flows and was calculated based on eq 1 b the nash and sutcliffe simulation efficiency ns ns indicates the degree of fitness of observed and simulated data and given by eq 2 nash and sutcliffe 1970 the value of ns ranges from 1 0 best to negative infinity the ns indicates how well the plot of observed versus simulated value fits the 1 1 line c the percent bias pbias pbias measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than their observed values for a given quantity over a specified period usually the entire calibration or validation period and calculated by eq 3 a value close to 0 is best for pbias moriasi et al 2007 d the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr standardizes rmse using the observations standard deviation rsr is computed as the ratio of the rmse and standard deviation of measured data moriasi et al 2007 as shown in eq 4 the general model performance rating and main characteristics are indicated in table 1 1 r

hydrological variability based on historical lc inputs lc 1974 1984 2000 and 2014 scenario analysis with respect to lc change is important to analyze the effect of plausible land management practices at a particular basin and subbasins where the impact of hydrologic variability on the society and ecosystem is mounting long term hydrologic simulation from the year 1983 2012 was made on a monthly and annual basis moreover the analysis of the impacts of lc change on the hydrologic variability was performed to evaluate the implication of lc change impact on the water balance components at different spatial and temporal scales the change between the historical lc categories was estimated by considering the relative difference between two consecutive periods of the lc maps and the corresponding simulated water balance components 2 4 partial least squares regression analysis of lc change impact on water balance components partial least squares regression plsr is a robust multivariate regression method that can be used to perform a wide range of analyses when the predictors exhibit collinearity shi et al 2013 plsr relates two data matrices x and y by a linear multivariate model each model parameter is estimated as the slope of a simple bivariate regression least squares between a matrix column or row as the y variable and another parameter vector as the x variable wold et al 2001 plsr technique provides the quantitative modeling of the complicated relationships between predictors and responses variable with complex problems wold et al 2001 detailed statistical background of plsr modeling can be found in the literature wold et al 2001 abdi 2003 tenenhaus et al 2005 plsris an extension of a multiple linear regression model in the simplest form a linear model specifies the relationship between a dependent variable y and a set of predictor variables x as shown in eq 5 5 y b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b p x p where b0 is the regression coefficient for the intercept and the bi values are the regression coefficients for variables 1 through p computed from the data the q² cumulated q2 cum index measures the global goodness of fit and the predictive quality of the models and sub models if there are several dependent variables the cross validated model quality index q2 percentage of variation explained by the explanatory variables and cross validated root mean squared error rmsecv between the predicted and observed values of each individual pass were calculated for each model the search for the maximum of the q²cum index is equivalent to finding the most stable model in the plsr modeling the importance of a predictor for the dependent variables is indicated by the variable importance in the projection vip yan et al 2013 the factors with high vip values of more than 1 are the most relevant in explaining the dependent variable and are considered to be significantly influential predictors of the plsr model shi et al 2013 ai et al 2015 li et al 2017 wold 1995 suggests vip value more than 0 8 is most relevant and significant for explaining the dependent variable and vip less than 0 5 are considered to be of minor importance for the prediction of dependent variables the vip and regression coefficients were used to explain the relative influence of each independent variable it is thus possible to determine the individual lc classes predictor variables which strongly interact with the corresponding water balance components the dependent variable the vip values provide information on the strength of influence for each predictor and the regression coefficients give the direction of the influence onderka et al 2012 the relationships between the predictors and the response variables can also be inferred from the plsr weights w woldesenbet et al 2017 it shows not only the magnitude but also the direction of influences negative or positive effect the main originality of plsr is to preserve the asymmetry of the relationship between predictors and dependent variables whereas other techniques treat them symmetrically abdi 2003 in the present paper the vip value was used to infer the most important lc classes which affect the particular water balance components in the upper awash basin the plsr model was used to evaluate the relationship between the changes in annual water balance components and particular lc classes the change in the lc maps of 1974 1984 2000 and 2014 and mean annual water balance components simulated based on each lc maps were used in the present study the plsr model analysis was performed using xlstat software excel add ins statistical tool www xlstat com the stepwise methodology of the study is summarized in fig 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 land cover lc change detection the lc change analysis in the past decades from the year 1974 2014 depicted that cropland was the main lc class followed by shrubland and forest areas the lc change detections between consecutive study periods revealed a continuous increment in the spatial extent of cropland and urban areas and the changes were also projected to intensify in the near future shawul and chakma 2019 the total area of cropland escalated from 49 0 in 1974 to 72 1 in 2014 in contrary shrubland was shrunk from 22 3 in 1974 to 15 9 in 2014 as shown in table 5 and fig 4 a to d the higher trend of expansion of urban areas was observed in the mid northern part of the basin in akaki subbasin mainly due to the encroachment of addis ababa and the surrounding towns as a result the urban area in the whole basin increased from 0 4 in 1974 to 2 9 in 2014 and it is expected to increase due to the higher population growth rate and socio economic development in the region a further rise in urban areas due to the higher population influx and the rapid socio economic development in addis ababa and adjacent cities inevitably reduce the areas of natural vegetation and cropland which may also lead to the relocation of croplands to the nearest possible regions the pasture forests and shrubland coverage were diminished throughout the selected historical periods forest and shrubland areas mainly sustained at the higher land slope terrains in the upstream parts of the basin bewket 2002 also found that large areas of forest shrubland and pasture lands were converted to agricultural and settlements due to the higher rate population growth in the highlands regions of ethiopia as a result of the dynamics in the lc the hydrologic process could be significantly altered the relative change in the urban areas was found to increase by 606 2 from 49km2 in the year 1974 to more than 343km2 in 2014 studies such as mengistu 2009 have also found similar results that large area of forest shrubland and pasture was altered to cropland and urban lands cropland expansion is the primary driver of deforestation and loss of natural vegetation in ethiopia due to a drastic increase in rural and urban populations teferi et al 2013 hailu et al 2015 kindu et al 2015 it can be seen that pasture coverage area is declined from 19 6 in 1974 to 2 5 in 2014 and also forest coverage decreased from 7 1 in 1974 to 5 3 in 2014 the huge loss of pasture grassland and forest area and the increase in cropland areas between 1974 and 1984 could be primarily attributed to change of the government system which has brought the new land reforms kindu et al 2015 further discussed the ethiopian government change in 1974 which involved the land to the tillers the 1975 land reform proclamation which allowed local peasants to have better access to land for cultivation consequently the cropland area largely increased from 49 0 in 1974 to 67 1 in 1984 at the expense of natural vegetation cover the lc classification accuracy has met the requirement indicated in congalton 1991 which is sufficient for land cover map mainly the overall accuracy was found to be 80 6 84 5 86 5 and 89 2 for the lc year 1974 1984 2000 and 2014 and the kappa coefficients of 0 76 0 81 0 83 and 0 87 for example table 2 highlights the user s accuracy producer s accuracy overall accuracy and kappa coefficients derived from the confusion matrix of the classified land cover map of lc 2014 and ground truth reference data waterbody was the most accurately classified lc classes with 100 0 user s and procedure s accuracy in general the overall accuracy and kappa coefficients lc classification accuracy assessment demonstrated strong agreement between the classified lc classes and ground truth values additional details about the historical and near future lc change analysis and the main drivers of lc change in the upper awash basin are provided by shawul and chakma 2019 3 2 calibration and validation of the swat model sensitivity analysis and model calibration were performed at five main gauging stations in the upper awash basin namely hombole melka kuntre mojo akaki and teji subbasins using the swat cup calibration and uncertainty analysis tool for each model runs the first three years of simulations were considered as model warm up period the most sensitive hydrologic parameters were used for the model calibration and validation processes the surface runoff parameters such as a cn2 mgt a sol awc sol a sol k sol and v ch k2 rte were more effective parameters to change in streamflow the baseflow parameters such as v alpha bf gw v gwqmn gw v revapmn gw v rchrg dp gw v gw delay gw and v gw revap gw were found to be more sensitive parameters for all subbasins as shown in table 3 moreover parameters that affect the lateral flow such as r lat ttime hru r slsoil hru and r slsubbsn hru were considered in the calibration processes to correct the delay in the monthly peak values the hydrologic parameter values were varied iteratively within the allowable ranges until satisfactory agreements between measured and simulated streamflow are obtained independently at each gauged subbasins rigorous model calibration efforts have improved the model performance for hydrologic simulations the swat model performance was evaluated by comparing the observed and simulated discharge series the simulated and observed streamflow hydrograph indicated the model captured the patterns of hydrologic variability both at calibration and validation period which proved the swat model to be capable of simulating the hydrologic processes in the upper awash basin a comparable result was obtained between mean monthly observed and simulated discharges in cubic meters per second cms at calibration and validation periods at all gauged subbasins as shown in table 4 the difference in the mean monthly discharge was maintained below 1 0 cms except at hombole subbasins 1 82 cms for the calibration period the mean monthly simulated values in the validation period showed slightly overestimation of the observed discharge at all stations mainly at melka kuntre hombole and akaki subbasins moreover very good model performance was obtained at hombole and melka kuntre subbasins with ns and r2 0 8 pbias 5 and rsr 0 50 for the calibration period good to very good model performance was obtained at mojo akaki and teji subbasins with ns and r2 0 65 pbias 15 and rsr 0 60 at calibration period satisfactory to very good model performance rating was obtained based on the mentioned model efficiency criteria at the discharge sites for the validation periods however overestimation of the monthly lower peak discharge in the belg season march april and may and underestimation of higher monthly peak values in the main rainfall kiremt season june july and august was observed the swat model underestimation of flow during peak rainy months and overestimation during the low flow conditions were also reported in studies gassman et al 2007 shawul et al 2016 woldesenbet et al 2017 the possible explanation for the inconsistency of model simulation of peak events could be due to lack of sufficient consideration of the rainfall intensity on runoff generation in the cn method which is used in the swat model zhang et al 2019 in addition to the model structure model assumptions limitations uncertainty from lack of consistent quality of temporal and spatial data including soil data land management data related to small scale irrigation application can be responsible for the slight discrepancy in the model simulation overall based on the visual inspection of time series graphs shown in fig 5 a to e as well as the statistical measures of the model performance evaluation met the criteria recommended in santhi et al 2001 moriasi et al 2007 both at calibration and validation periods thus the swat model can be considered as an appropriate tool for simulating the hydrological variability and plausible watershed management scenarios in the upper awash basin 3 3 impact of land cover lc change on the hydrologic processes in the upper awash basin 3 3 1 hydrological impact of lc change at the basin level the impact of land cover lc change on the hydrologic components mainly on the surface runoff surfq lateral flow latq groundwater flow gwq and actual evapotranspiration et in the upper awash river basin were analyzed on the mean annual basis the annual water balance components were based on four independent simulations using lc 1974 lc 1984 lc 2000 and lc 2014 to illustrate the spatial and temporal variability in the basin the change in annual basin values relative to lc indicated higher fluctuation of surfq and latq as compared to the change in gwq and et values as shown in table 5 on average the recent lc 2014 yields higher surfq and lower gwq and latq as compared to the earlier historical lc data the intensification of cropland and urban areas and removal of forests shrubland and pasture increases the average surfq marhaento et al 2017 have also argued that an increase in the settlement area has contributed to a higher ratio of surface runoff to streamflow and a lower ratio of groundwater flow the percentage change in annual water balance components between lc 1974 and 1984 shows a 9 06 increase in depth of surfq a 16 3 decrease in latq 0 1 decrease in gwq and 0 98 reduction in et conversion of forest and shrubland to cropland results in the decrease of et and consequently increases surface runoff legesse et al 2003 the increase in cropland area as well as the reduction of vegetation cover have triggered the increase of surface runoff the 1974 1984 period of the analysis revealed the lc change was mainly due to a higher increase in cropland 18 1 and massive loss in vegetation cover such as pasture 14 0 consequently latq diminished by 16 4 and surfq increased by 9 0 whereas negligible response was obtained to change in gwq 0 1 and et 1 0 in the same period between 1974 and 1984 as shown in table 5 schilling et al 2008 also discussed that increasing crop production mainly corn crop at the expense of grasslands will increase the surface runoff decrease annual et and ultimately increase the water yield which may also lead to more sediment loss from the watershed interestingly improvement in the area coverage of forest from 3 2 in 2000 to 5 3 in 2014 and pasture coverage area from the lowest coverage nearly 0 9 in 2000 to 2 9 in 2014 was observed the main attributable explanation for the increase of vegetation cover in the 2000 2014 period could be due to the government initiatives of climate resilient and low carbon strategies through large scale land rehabilitation afforestation and agroforestry practices to reduce the pressure on forest resources fdre 2011 however it resulted in an insignificant effect on the annual basin values due to the contrasting effect of the increase in cropland and urban and reduction in shrubland generally the 40 year period of lc change analysis is characterized by significant increase in cropland and reduction in forest shrubland and pasture between 1974 and 2014 and resulted in 18 4 increment in the depth of surfq while the latq gwq and et decreased by 24 0 2 1 and 0 1 respectively the series of annual and seasonal water balance simulated between the years 1983 and 2012 based on the four historical lc change reveals higher variations as shown in fig 6 a the annual and seasonal surface runoff mm and the percent change simulated based on lc 1974 lc 1984 lc 2000 and lc 2014 revealed in increasing trend between each consecutive period of lc change input on the contrary the lateral flow and groundwater flow exhibited decreasing trends the lateral flow as shown in fig 6b mainly diminished between lc 1974 and lc 1984 due to a higher percentage of area loss in pasture shrubland and forest cover within the same period an increase in cropland leads to decrease in the infiltration capacity of the soil as a result of soil compaction which triggers more surface runoff and reduces lateral flow and gw flow moreover the reduction in forest land decreases et value hence more water will be available as surface runoff and total water yield similarly the annual and seasonal groundwater flow exhibits decrement with the recent lc data however the magnitude of change was negligible for groundwater flow as shown in fig 6c a rise in the depth of surface runoff was obtained for lc 2014 due to the rapid expansion and encroachment of urban and cropland areas as the result of the socio economic development and higher area loss in indigenous vegetation cover in the upper awash basin in addition to climate variability and lc changes mainly deforestation and urbanization the slope variation soil types and geological conditions could contribute to the impact of land use change on the water balances bruijnzeel 2004 marhaento et al 2017 a closer look at the figure also revealed the relative change in the annual surfq latq and gwq demonstrate higher change in 1974 1984 and 2000 2014 period whereas the change between years 1984 2000 is relatively lower for example the mean annual change in surfq increased by 10 0 between lc 1974 lc 1984 3 1 between lc 1984 lc 2000 and 6 6 between lc 2000 lc 2014 the change in mean annual latq also exhibited a higher magnitude of change in the lc 1974 lc 1984 period which was reduced by 14 lc 1984 lc 2000 by 0 6 and lc 2000 lc 2014 by 6 0 the change in the mean annual gwq was also decreasing but the magnitude of change was relatively lower for example the rate of change was found to be 0 1 in lc 1974 lc 1984 2 4 in lc 1984 lc 2000 and 0 6 in lc 2000 lc 2014 unlike surfq and latq the rate of change in gwq shows higher magnitude in 1984 2000 period it indicates that the gwq values are more responsive to change in forest and urban areas as shown in table 5 further higher rate of change in the area of forest and urban coverage was obtained in 1984 2000 period moreover the average seasonal variability of hydrologic components due to lc change was evaluated based on four main rainfall seasons namely summer seasons jja the autumn season son the spring season mam and the winter season djf as shown in fig 6 the impact of lc change is more pronounced in the wet months in the summer season more than 52 of the surfq amount occurs during the summer season which is considered the wettest season and 19 of the surfq amount in the year occurs during the spring season which is considered to be the intermediate season in terms of wetness winter season is a dry season in terms of rainfall amount which accounts for a total annual rainfall of 7 7 in the upper awash basin the seasonal water balance anomalies due to lc change between the years 1974 and 2014 exhibited a decrement in the latq and gwq throughout all seasons and increment in the surfq as shown in the seasonal bar plot in fig 6a to c higher loss of pasture shrubland and forest area between lc 1974 and lc 1984 resulted in a higher increment of surfq in agreement with this study zhou et al 2013 have also indicated that in terms of seasonal variations of hydrological fluxes the impact of lc change on streamflow was more during the wet season and a relatively smaller change in the dry season 3 3 2 hydrological impact of lc change at the subbasin level the subbasins level mean annual surfq and gwq in relation to the change in the area of land cover class in the four main gauged subbasins hombole melka kuntre akaki and mojo demonstrated higher variations between lc year 1974 and 2014 as shown in fig 7 a b c and d respectively the subbasins which experienced higher loss of forest shrubland and pasture to cropland received increments in the surfq and total water yield and decrement in gwq and et akaki subbasin which is mainly categorized by a higher urban growth due to expansion of addis ababa city and a larger decrease in pasture and shrubland area experienced a larger increase in the surfq more than 75 83 mm increment of the depth of surfq was obtained whereas the gwq diminished by 9 6 in the akaki subbasin birhanu et al 2018 also stated higher fluctuations of surface and groundwater resources in the akaki subbasin is triggering significant pressure on the water supply and recurrent flooding in the nearby areas higher anomalies in the surfq and gwq were also observed in the hombole melka kuntre and mojo subbasins due to the alteration of the significant amount of shrubland forest and pasture land to cropland between the year 1974 and 2014 mango et al 2011 also concluded that the conversion of forest to agricultural lands have increased the overland flow and reduced the base flow amount however in the mojo subbasin surfq and gwq revealed positive change between lc 1974 and lc 2014 the change cropland area at the mentioned periods was smaller 8 at mojo subbasin as compared to other subbasins which have relatively larger increase in cropland moreover in both time periods 1974 and 2014 cropland was the dominant lc classes that have more than 80 area coverage in the mojo subbasin the hydrologic response of river basins at multiple spatial scales can highlight the vulnerable subbasins or reaches due to the extent of lc change which may help to prioritize the efforts for plausible land management practices to maintain the healthy functioning of watershed processes the spatial variations of hydrologic components due to lc change at subbasins level a total of 77 subbasins in the upper awash basin were analyzed considering the relative difference between four separate hydrologic simulations forced by lc 1974 and lc 1984 and between lc 2000 and lc 2014 the impacts of lc changes were more pronounced at the subbasin level because of the contrasting effects are not averaged by lc variations contained in the whole basin the subbasins level impact of lc change on hydrologic parameters namely scs curve number cn surface runoff surfq groundwater flow gwq and actual evapotranspiration et was found to be higher than the whole basin level as shown in fig 8 a and b the positive and negative lc change impact on water balance component at smaller subbasin level could compensate each other at the larger basin level thus the complexity of large heterogeneous basins might obscure the implications of lc changes on water balance at the local scale wilk and hughes 2002 wagner et al 2013 schilling et al 2014 marhaento et al 2017 the basin wide average change in the hydrologic process due to lc change indicated that the cn as 1 86 surfq as 6 31 gwq as 3 62 and et as 0 46 between lc 1974 and lc 1984 furthermore the change between lc 2000 and lc 2014 shows an increase in the cn by 2 53 and surfq by 8 99 a decrease in the gwq by 2 59 and et by 1 72 the subbasin level impact of lc change is higher than the basin scale and it was also found that lc change impacts on water balance at the outlets of the large scale basins are less significant than in the smaller subbasins the subbasins level change in the surfq was found to be in the range of 42 6 to 100 0 between lc 1974 and lc1984 similarly higher change in gwq was also observed in the subbasin as compared to the mean basin values as shown in fig 8 spatial scales have significant role in determining the magnitude of hydrologic change for example the impact of agroforestry was larger for the smaller subbasins as compared with the entire river basin mwangi et al 2016 subbasins which have experienced larger increments of cropland and urban area received relatively larger value of cn and surfq and contrasting effect to the gwq values subbasins in the downstream area which have relatively plain topography experienced a higher rate of increase in the cropland as a result surfq highly increased while et and gwq decrease at the same time wilk and hughes 2002 also found that converting forest and savanna to agriculture increases runoff whereas conversion of other lc to forest largely decreases runoff amount 3 3 3 the relative contribution of lc change on water balance components based on partial least squares regression plsr model the annual basin values of important water balance components were generated from 1983 to 2012 years of simulations the correlation matrix indicated in table 6 shows the correlations among the explanatory variables lc classes the dependent variables water balance components and between both groups of variables the correlation coefficient cc revealed that the annual surface runoff surfq was highly attributed to change in the area of cropland and urban land with a cc value of 0 94 and 0 90 respectively similarly the change in water yield was positively attributed to increase in cropland and urban areas on the contrary the lateral flow latq and groundwater flow gwq was inversely related to change in the area of cropland and urban which resulted in negative cc values the forest and shrubland contribute more evapotranspiration et per unit area however the mean annual value indicates et was the least affected water balance components by the lc change which was found to have lower cc values positive relationships were observed between the change in the forest pasture waterbody shrubland areas and groundwater flow parameters in other words the change in natural vegetation covers such as dense forest shrubland and pasture was negatively correlated with surfq which implied that improving the vegetation cover on the hillside and abandoned land area could help to reduce the direct surface runoff in the upper awash basin minimizing the surface runoff amount is vital to reduce the recurring flooding and sedimentation problems in the awash basin urban and cultivated areas are the main contributor to the change in the water yield surface runoff and et including a reduction in the shallow and deep aquifer recharges the intensification of urban and cultivated lands as the key environmental stressor which significantly affects water balance components of a basin anand et al 2018b the result from plsr model constructed for the annual water balance components surfq latq gwq et and wtrq is presented in table 7 including r² mse rmse q² q² cum percent of explained variability and cumulative percentage of explained variability in the response variables based on the available data series the plsr model automatically generated two model components comp1 and comp2 the two plsr components are generally sufficient for a limited number of products and the choice of two components allows convenient graphical analysis tenenhaus et al 2005 the cumulative explained variations in y and q² cum that corresponds to the correlations between the explanatory x variable and dependent y variables with the components are close to 1 with two components this indicates the two plsr components summarize well both the x and the y variables the first plsr component explained 97 7 of the variability in the surfq 94 3 in the latq and 90 7 in the gwq the cumulative explained variance for the second component of all y variables was higher more than 98 the addition of the second plsr component substantially improved the variance explained in the y variables the plot of the correlation circle indicated in fig 9 provides a graphical display of the x and y variables using the correlation coefficient of the two plsr components on t1 and t2 axes it provides a summarized view of the relationship between the model variables in the form of monoplot the circle in the correlation plot represents the regression coefficient r² 1 0 the length of line to the circle indicates how well the variables are represented whereas a shorter line that appears nearer to the center of the circle within r² 0 2 are said to be not well represented by the variables the angle between the vectors is the estimate of the correlation between the variables the cosine of the angle between these lines gives the correlation coefficient a small angle indicates the variables are positively correlated whereas an angle of 90 degrees indicates the variables are not correlated and the angle close to 180 degrees indicates the variables are negatively correlated tenenhaus et al 2005 the monoplot exhibits that the change in cropland directly influenced the surface runoff and the area of cropland is inversely correlated to the groundwater flow and lateral flow interestingly from the correlation map it can be observed that forest is strongly correlated with groundwater and pasture and shrubland are highly correlated with the change in lateral flow it also appears that the et value is less impacted by the lc changes on an annual basis in the upper awash basin however the subbasins level impact of lc change on et was higher than the basin wide level as shown in fig 8a and b gashaw et al 2018 also determined that the influence of lc change on et is minimal especially on the monthly average values the impact of lc change and climate variability was higher on annual et in the watersheds where the expansion of forest plantations is higher compared to other watersheds berihun et al 2019 as urban area increases there will be more impervious soils which in turn increase the surface runoff thereby increases the total water yield of the basin consequently a strong correlation between the urban area and water yield was obtained furthermore it can be deduced from the monoplot that correlation among x or predictor variables that cropland is negatively correlated with pasture shrubland forest and waterbody the variable importance for the projection vips of each explanatory variable for two components allows for identifying the explanatory variables that contribute the most to the models the plot of the correlation circle indicates how important the individual lc classes on the variability of annual basin values however the vip values can provide a more comprehensive expression of the relative importance of predictors values vip 1 and or vip 0 8 based on wold s criteria indicate that the predictor variable is considered to be significantly important to the corresponding dependent variable moreover the plsr weight w gives a more specific and a fair idea of the sign and the relative weight of the corresponding coefficients in the model the squares of w values more than 0 2 i e w2 0 2 indicated that the plsr components are mainly weighted on the corresponding variables the bold faced values shown in table 8 exhibits the plsr component is considered to be more important to the response variables for example for surfq the higher vip 1 21 was obtained by cropland followed by pasture and urban land each with vip value of vip 1 15 and shrubland with vip 0 87 in addition the w value shows the direction of influence that the lc class has on the corresponding water balance components the amount of surfq is inversely related to pasture land w 0 47 whereas it is directly related to change in cropland w 0 49 and urban area w 0 47 the highest vip value for latq was obtained for cropland vip 1 3 w 0 53 for pasture vip 1 23 w 0 5 and for urban vip 1 07 w 0 44 similarly the gwq was more impacted by expansion of urban area vip 1 34 w 0 55 and forest area vip 1 04 w 0 47 noticeably the expansion of urban area and cropland increases the surface runoff it inversely impacts the latq and gwq and vice versa however the change in the area of forest pasture and shrubland has a negative correlation with surfq which implies that an increase in vegetation covers would significantly reduce the surface runoff this result is in agreement with earlier studies such as shi et al 2013 zeinivand and nourmohammadi 2017 in which the forest area was negatively related to the surface runoff amount and sediment yield forests contribute more to the evapotranspiration et per unit area than other lc classes such as cropland and pasture thus deforestation leads to a decrease in the annual et value consequently the amount of surface runoff increases woldesenbet et al 2017 have also reported that deforestation and the expansion of cultivated land in the subbasins resulted in the reduction of et but increased surface runoff and groundwater components however the plrs output revealed unclear relationships between lc changes and et it shows et is inversely correlated with forest and change in a water body which was expected to be positively correlated a number of factor can affect the simulated et values such as the swat model limitations of plant growth module in modeling trees and perennial plants in the tropics van griensven et al 2012 strauch and volk 2013 mwangi et al 2016 where rainfall is the dominant plant growth factor than temperature alemayehu et al 2017 moreover limitations due to lack of relevant weather data other than precipitation and temperature which are responsible for the estimation of et could also be attributed to the unlikely response of et the vip values which are indicated in fig 10 a to e for the first plsr component 95 confidence interval of the six predictor variables lc classes used in the plsr model shows the most important contributor to change in the annual basin values it allows identifying the variables that mainly contribute to the difference in the specific water balance component the horizontal dashed lines were drawn based on the threshold value of vip larger than 0 8 and 1 0 for example three out of six variables cropland urban and pasture have vip greater than 1 threshold thus the variables were considered more critical to the surfq as shown in fig 10a yan et al 2013 have also indicated that change in the farmland and urban area poses greater influence in the variability of streamflow and sediment yield it was observed that pasture and cropland have a lower influence on et whereas forest shrubland urban and water body have more contribution to the annual et values in the upper awash basin moreover the increase in the urban and the decline of forest area more significantly contribute to change in the gwq the result also shows that change in the shrubland exerts less influence on the annual gwq future research on the application of the plsr model on the importance of land uses and land management practices on the hydrologic variability will help to provide a thorough understanding of the watershed processes which is vital for water management interventions 4 conclusions assessment of the impact of land cover lc change on the hydrologic variability at multiple spatial and temporal scales highlight the vulnerable subbasins which are vital for planning sound watershed management interventions this paper examines the influence of lc change on the water balance components using integrated approaches of remote sensing hydrologic modeling and partial least squares regression plsr modeling in the upper awash basin the efficiency of the swat model simulation was evaluated at five main gauged subbasins and the model was capable of predicting the hydrologic variability in the upper awash basin the lc change analysis during the past half century mainly revealed a considerable decline in the coverage of forest pasture and shrubland due to the swelling increase of agriculture and settlement areas as a result relocation of cropland to proximate marginally suitable high slope terrains and removal of the forest and shrubland would pose an adverse impact which triggers an imbalance in the hydrologic components of the basin the impact of lc change is highly pronounced at small scale subbasins than at the whole basin level thus assessment of lc change impacts on hydrologic processes should be done in a sufficient spatial and temporal detail at subbasins level to identify the more impacted areas the shift from the indigenous forest shrubland and pasture to cultivation and urban land caused a relatively significant increase in the surface runoff and total water yield and decreasing trend in lateral flow groundwater flow and actual evapotranspiration the correlation matrix among lc classes and annual water balance components revealed that the surface runoff was highly attributed to change in the area of cropland and urban land with a higher correlation coefficient cc value of 0 94 and 0 90 lateral flow and groundwater flow were inversely correlated with change in the area of cropland and urban which resulted in higher negative cc values based on the plsr correlation plot it can be concluded that forest is strongly correlated with groundwater flow and pasture and shrubland are highly correlated with the change in lateral flow moreover the value of vip 1 and the square of w 0 2 indicates the plsr components are mainly weighted on the corresponding variables which signify the lc classes as a more influential variable to the corresponding water balance components the basin scale mean annual et value was less responsive to lc change as compared to other water balance components mainly changes in cropland and urban area have a negative influence on the groundwater flow and the increase in the forest area could significantly enhance groundwater flow the findings of this study provided valuable information on the relative influence of particular land use to improve a specific water balance component which is vital for planning sustainable water resources management interventions reforestation of degraded high slope terrains could enhance groundwater recharge and reduce surface runoff thereby improves the water balance of the basin future studies should consider the improvement of the swat model capability to simulate peak runoff and evapotranspiration mainly in tropical areas the high level of land competition between different sectors should be managed through the regulation of unplanned urban and agricultural expansions furthermore appropriate policy measures should be implemented to ensure sustainable water resources management and to improve the

8413,considering that most water supply reservoirs were designed and are operated with limited streamflow records and that persistence long memory is often present in reservoir inflows it not surprising that reservoirs designed and operated with 100 reliability have failed due to unaccounted uncertainties the descoberto reservoir central brazil failed to supply the water demand in 2017 although mass balance analyses indicated a failure free condition during its previous 31 years of operation the objective of the present study was to identify the presence of long memory processes in the descoberto reservoir inflows and to reassess its reliability with alternative methods and statistics after persistently low inflows were detected in the years preceding reservoir failure autocorrelation and rescaled range analyses were performed in the inflow series confirming the presence of long term process ltp hurst coefficient 0 655 reservoir reliability was then reassessed for the pre failure period 1986 2016 using three storage yield reliability s y r methods and ltp statistics the reassessed pre failure reservoir reliability was 96 05 very close to the observed post failure reliability 96 87 estimated by mass balance analysis the 3 difference observed between the reliabilities using classical and ltp statistics resulted from a higher standard deviation in the reservoir inflows capturing the long term variability not evident in the classical analysis if persistence occurs in inflows reservoir reliability could be assessed using a similar approach improving reservoir behavior forecast and management keywords reliability reservoir inflows hurst phenomenon 1 introduction the operational reliability of a reservoir is an index indicating how satisfactorily it meets the water demand without failure carty and cunnane 1990 pegram 1980 some water supply reservoirs have failed even when their reliabilities were close to 100 due to extreme events such as long droughts moy et al 1986 in the design of water supply reservoirs storage yield reliability s y r equations are traditionally used to determine a reservoir capacity s required to deliver a yield y with a given reliability r kuria and vogel 2014 s y r equations are useful not only for reservoir design but also for reservoir behavior forecasting where observed hydrologic data instead of synthetic series are used kuria and vogel 2015 reservoirs are often built using incomplete hydrological information which introduces uncertainty into their future operation wallis and o connell 1973 even for large streamflow series vogel et al 1998 the conclusion that stationary values of reservoir storage capacities are only obtained with simulations using inflow sequences of 1000 years or more pretto et al 1997 is a strong evidence of that incompleteness additionally the natural trends observed in many streamflow time series e g burn et al 2008 which are enhanced by climate change mateus and tullos 2016 gersonius et al 2013 also affect reservoir capacity design and operational reliability soundharajan et al 2016 because of this variability some authors question the assumption of streamflow stationarity in reservoir design and operation milly et al 2008 although water supply reservoirs are expected to operate under fixed drafts pretto et al 1997 variable water demand patterns may also impact reservoir operational reliability moy et al 1986 simonovic 1987 furthermore the intrinsic processes governing streamflow variability including those related to long memory persistence also add to the uncertainty affecting reservoir reliability klemes et al 1981 persistence is a long term statistical property of a time series such as streamflow where low flow periods follow other low flow

reported a reduction of 10 in reservoir reliability under the presence of long term persistence h 0 74 in the inflow data compared to that of an independent inflow series considering that most of the existing reservoirs were designed and are operated with limited streamflow records bhattacharya et al 1983 kuria and vogel 2014 and since persistence is often present in inflow series wallis and o connell 1973 it not surprising that water supply reservoirs designed and operated with 100 reliability have failed cheng et al 2017 due to unaccounted uncertainties the descoberto reservoir in central brazil failed to meet the water demand in 2017 in spite of its 100 operational reliability immediately prior to failure adasa 2016 the objective of this paper was to examine if persistence in the inflows contributed to the failure of the descoberto reservoir and to reassess the pre failure reservoir reliability using different s y r methods and ltp statistics which could allow the timely adoption of preventive measures 2 materials and methods 2 1 the descoberto reservoir the descoberto is an unregulated reservoir located in central brazil supplying water to 2 million people in brazil s capital brasilia fig 1 the reservoir s hydrologic characteristics are presented in table 1 the reservoir has no major abstractions upstream and mean annual precipitation in its drainage basin is 1400 mm yr 1 although water demand never exceeded the firm yield during the reservoir s 31 yr operational period adasa 2016 a series of six sequential low annual inflows in the last years of the series all below the long term mean led to an operational failure in 2017 to avoid a collapse in the city s water supply water managers established a 30 water rationing scheme throughout the 2017 reducing the reservoir draft from 5 2 to 3 5 m3 s 1 2 2 reservoir reliability using mass balance analysis to assess the failure frequency and the actual reliability of the descoberto reservoir during its operational life 1986 2017 the concatenated behavior analysis cba pretto et al 1997 a mass balance equation of inflows and outflows from a finite storage was applied on a yearly basis starting with a full reservoir in the end of 1985 considering that the reservoir storage at any time t is limited between zero dead storage and c reservoir capacity the reservoir water balance equation is

its operational period was obtained by dividing the number of years in which the required water demand could not be supplied nf by the number of years in the total sequence n jain and bhunya 2008 namely 5 pf nf n the time based reliability r is simply the reciprocal of pf harr 1987 namely 6 r 1 pf the probability of failure of a reservoir pf in eq 6 is often used as a proxy of risk risk in turn is the product of hazard and vulnerability and resilience can be described as the societal capacity of coping with risk ganoulis 2009 the cba was applied to the descoberto reservoir and the corresponding reliability was calculated for the following operating periods without 1986 2016 and with 1986 2017 failure since the cba is a mass conservation equation and since actual hydrologic series was used in the computations the cba based reliability was considered the actual observed reservoir reliability in the present study 2 3 reservoir reliability using s y r equations in order to realistically assess reservoir behavior and reliability in the period immediately prior to failure 1986 2016 which would allow the adoption of preventive measures in a timely manner three robust s y r methods were utilized using both classical and ltp statistics the s y r methods used were i the conceptual gould dincer model mcmahon et al 2007 ii the empirical kuria vogel s y r equation kuria and vogel 2014 and iii harr s 1987 stochastic capacity demand model the gould dincer g d equation was developed using a wide spectrum of global hydrology mcmahon et al 2007 and estimates the reservoir capacity required to meet a demand with a probability of non exceedance of inflows equivalent to the mean first passage time from a full to an empty reservoir the equation for the normal g d equation with autocorrelation in inflows after isolating the standard normal variate of non exceedance is mcmahon et al 2007 7 z p 4 c 1 1 r 1 v 2 μ 1 r 1 where zp standard normal variate associated with the

s stochastic capacity demand model the safety margin of a system reservoir is a function of the normalized difference between mean water availability capacity and the mean water requirement demand

in 106 m3 once the zp and zs values in eqs 7 8 were computed using the dg n and the kuria vogel models respectively the reservoir probability of failure pf was estimated by 10 pf norm dist p z where norm dist p z probability of the standardized normal variate zp or zs obtained from an electronic spreadsheet in the case of harr s capacity demand model eq 9 the probability of failure pf was obtained by harr 1987 11 pf 0 5 norm dist p zr 2 reservoir reliability for the three s y r models was calculated with eq 6 considering the pre failure operational period 1986 2016 and using both classical and ltp statistics see section below the r values calculated using the three s y r relationships were then compared to the actual observed post failure reliability obtained with the cba analysis to assess the ability of the former in forecasting reservoir behavior before failure 2 4 statistical analyses of the reservoir time series classical statistics such as the mean standard deviation coefficient of variation and distribution skewness were computed for the record samples of yearly inflows demands and water availabilities considering the periods without 1986 2016 n 31 and with failure 1986 2017 n 32 since the s y r models required normality in the distributions of inflows xt water availabilities st 1 xt and water demands dt these series were tested for normality using the kolmogorov smirnov test haan 1994 additionally the occurrence of significant trends or shifts in the time series of xt dt and st 1 xt was examined using the mann kendall test burn et al 2008 to assess long term persistence in the hydrologic records the autocorrelation and the adjusted rescaled range tests were performed in the inflow and water availability time series the sample autocorrelation function acf was calculated by the following equations salas 1992 12 rk ck co 13 c k 1 n t 1 n k x t k x x t x where rk autocorrelation coefficient of lag k xt inflow observation at time t and x inflow mean when the correlogram of rk versus the lag k decays rapidly to zero after one or two lags it is an indication of short memory in the series while a slower decay indicates persistency or long memory salas 1992 the rescaled range test for the hurst effect in the inflow series was calculated using the mandelbrot and wallis 1969 method and subsequently adjusted for finite samples by hamed s 2007 procedure taking sr t d as the standard deviation of the observations from time t to time t d 1 r t d as the minimum reservoir size required over the same period and xj as the river annual inflows mandelbrot and wallis 1969 we have 14 s r t d j 1 t d 1 x j 2 d x t d 2 15 r t d m a x 1 u d j 1 t u 1 x j u x t d m i n 1 u d j 1 t u 1 x j u x t d where 16 x t d xi xt d 1 d the ratio r t d sr t d is the rescaled range the rescaled range test consists in averaging the values of r sr for a number of values of t for a given value of d and plotting the average result q d against log d the slope of the graph of q d versus log d found using ordinary linear regression is the hurst coefficient h mandelbrot and wallis 1969 if h is approximately 0 5 the series presents white noise but if 0 5 h 1 the series shows fractional gaussian noise or long term persistence davies and harte 1987 the rescaled range r sr analysis is considered a robust statistic for testing the presence of long term persistence and its intensity in the time series particularly with respect to long tailed distributions beran 1992 however the r sr method can be biased particularly when samples are small hamed 1997 therefore the biased h values of the inflow and water availability series obtained by the r sr method were adjusted using hamed s 2007 procedure which consists of a modified expression of the expected value of the rescaled range the bias in the hurst coefficient calculated with the r sr method using a finite sample is hamed 2007 17 bias h h h bh a nh b where h biased hurst coefficient calculated by the r sr method h unbiased hurst coefficient n number of observation in the series and a b are coefficients of a linear regression equation used to estimate the expected value of r sr hamed 2007 once h and the corresponding bias were obtained the unbiased h was calculated using eq 17 according to hamed 2007 h only becomes asymptotic unbiased when n 1000 reinforcing the need of h adjustment in the present study n 32 due to low frequency fluctuations in the unknown long term series of inflows its variance σ2 is potentially higher than that of the finite 32 yr long series s2 estimated by classical statistics koutsoyiannis 2003 since reservoir reliability depends on inflow variance eqs 7 9 the latter was calculated for the reservoir inflow xt and water availability st 1 xt

results and discussion 3 1 reservoir hydrology statistics the annual inflows water demands and storages of the descoberto reservoir during the period 1986 2017 are presented in fig 2 this figure shows decreasing reservoir inflows in the last 6 years of the series and a systematic increase in water demand since 1986 the break in the water demand series in 2017 reflects the 30 draft reduction because of the adopted water rationing scheme fig 3 shows the clustering of low inflows during the last 6 years of the series culminating with a record low of 100 106 m3 in 2017 which fell below the lower 95 prediction limit of the inflow series the statistics of the reservoir s annual inflows xt demands dt and water availabilities st 1 xt are presented in tables 2 and 3 for the periods 1986 2016 without failure and 1986 2017 with failure respectively despite the coefficient of variation of the descoberto reservoir inflows 0 2 was much lower than the mean reported by karamouz and houck 1982 for north american reservoirs 0 7 the apparently stable hydrology of the former was changed when persistently low inflows occurred in the last six years of the series leading to the 2017 failure the statistically significant values of the k s test in tables 2 and 3 confirmed the normality in the distributions of inflows demands and water availabilities which allowed their utilization by the s y r equations the skewness coefficient of the reservoir inflows distribution was 0 1 the m k statistic in tables 2 and 3 indicate that the increasing trend in water demand in fig 2 was statistically significant additionally a significant decreasing trend was observed in water availability in the 1986 2017 series due to the low inflow and reduced reservoir storage in 2017 although the mean draft ratio 0 52 of the descoberto reservoir was in the average of other water supply reservoirs in the world mcmahon et al 2007 fig 4 shows that the descoberto draft ratio increased exponentially during its operational life with the demand equaling the inflow in 2017 d2017 x2017 1 0 furthermore the negative correlation coefficient between the series of water availability and demand r 0 37 may have contributed to the reservoir failure in 2017 a failure triggering factor recognized previously by simonovic 1987 the autocorrelation functions of the reservoir inflows xt and water availabilities st 1 xt are presented in fig 5 according to this figure there is a slow decrease in rk in lags 1 2 and 3 indicating the existence of a long term stochastic process persistence in both series salas 1992 the lag 1 correlations for the xt and st 1 xt series were 0 2 and 0 4 respectively the graphs of the r sr statistic of the inflow xt and water availability st 1 xt series of the descoberto reservoir in the period prior to failure 1986 2016 are presented in fig 6 there is a good fit between log r sr and log k in both cases and the biased hurst coefficients were 0 669 and 0 708 for the inflow and water availability series respectively the biased and adjusted unbiased hurst coefficients for both series are presented in fig 7 the unbiased h values of the inflows 0 655 and water availabilities 0 694 fell between 0 5 and 1 0 an evidence of persistence in both series davies and harte 1987 these results combined with the slow decrease observed in the first three lags of the acfs fig 5 reinforce the presence of autocorrelation and ltp in both series salas 1992 karamouz and houck 1982 also reported the presence of autocorrelation in inflow series of three water supply reservoirs of the united states with an average h value of 0 68 table 4 presents the classical and ltp standard error of the means and standard deviation of the inflows and water availabilities for the period prior to failure 1986 2016 as expected the standard deviations of the reservoir inflows and water availabilities in the ltp case were 1 7 and 1 95 times higher than those of the classical statistics respectively this is in accordance with beran s 1992 conclusion that although the sample mean of persistent hydrologic series does not lose efficiency compared to the best linear unbiased estimator the classical sample variance does the higher standard deviations of the ltp hydrologic series in turn have affected the descoberto reservoir reliability as described below 3 2 reservoir reliability the actual observed probability of failure and reliability of the descoberto reservoir estimated by the cba for the periods without 1986 2016 and with 1986 2017 failure are shown in table 5 in the pre failure case pf 0 31 0 r 100 and in the post failure situation pf 1 32 3 13 r 96 87 the fact that the descoberto reservoir failed with only 32 years of operation is not surprising moy et al 1986 performing multi objective analyses in different climate scenarios concluded that even a reliable reservoir is vulnerable to failure in extreme droughts table 6 presents the probability of failure and reliability of the descoberto reservoir calculated with the three s y r models using both classical and ltp statistics in the period prior to failure 1986 2016 according to table 6 the s y r reliabilities in the classical case were all above 99 i e very close to the 100 reliability of the observed pre failure cba analysis the pre failure s y r reliabilities in the ltp case on the other hand ranged from 92 09 to 98 30 with an average of 96 05 much closer to the observed cba reservoir reliability after failure 96 87 although a reservoir reliability of 96 may be considered satisfactory by some water managers it means that the reservoir could fail once every 30 years an unacceptable scenario for most water users considering that the 100 reliability yield was never exceeded during the reservoir operational life the 2017 failure indicates that the use of classical statistics underestimates reservoir reliability a fact recognized earlier by jain and bhunya 2008 the main difference between the classical and ltp statistics and the likely cause of the underestimation of reservoir reliability in the former was the higher standard error of the mean and standard deviation of the reservoir inflows in ltp case capturing the hurst persistence in the inflow series not evident in the classical analysis in a previous study carty and cunnane 1990 have concluded that larger standard errors of storage volume estimates could lead to increased error in estimating reservoir capacity particularly for short historical records furthermore graves et al 2017 reported that long memory plays an important role in reservoir predictability and behavior since it affects the accuracy and confidence of forecasts when short historical records are utilized the advantage of the capacity demand model when compared with the other two s y r methods is that the former accounts for the variability in water demand as observed from table 2 the coefficient of variation of water demand was 0 18 similar to that of inflows 0 2 additionally the capacity demand model also considers the correlation coefficient between these two random variables r 0 37 in the present study if this correlation were not considered in the analysis the reliability of the descoberto reservoir would be overestimated by 0 6 a potential bias recognized earlier by harr 1987 the results of the present study showed that the incorporation of ltp statistics in reservoir reliability analysis estimated by appropriate s y r methods significantly improved reservoir behavior forecast prior to failure when persistence was present in the inflow records hence if one suspects that ltp occurs in inflow series of similar reservoirs the present approach could help prevent operational failures by allowing the adoption of precautionary measures such as draft reduction vogel et al 2007 and variable reservoir curves mateus and tullos 2016 4 conclusions despite mass balance analyses using classical statistics indicated a failure free condition in 2016 the descoberto reservoir failed in 2017 underestimating actual post failure reliability by 3 the leading cause of failure was the persistence of low inflows during the last 6 years of the series depleting the reservoir storage aggravated by an increasing trend in the reservoir draft ratio after acf and rescaled range analyses indicated the presence of persistence in both inflow and water availability series with hurst coefficients of 0 655 and 0 694 respectively the mean reservoir reliability estimated by three s y r methods in the period prior to failure was 96 05 very close to the actual post failure cba reliability 96 87 the difference between the s y r reliabilities using classical and ltp statistics resulted from a higher inflow standard deviation in the latter capturing the long term variability not evident in the classical analysis the results in the present study indicate that if persistence occurs in inflows reservoir reliability could be adequately assessed by s y r models and ltp statistics improving reservoir behavior forecast the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing

8413,considering that most water supply reservoirs were designed and are operated with limited streamflow records and that persistence long memory is often present in reservoir inflows it not surprising that reservoirs designed and operated with 100 reliability have failed due to unaccounted uncertainties the descoberto reservoir central brazil failed to supply the water demand in 2017 although mass balance analyses indicated a failure free condition during its previous 31 years of operation the objective of the present study was to identify the presence of long memory processes in the descoberto reservoir inflows and to reassess its reliability with alternative methods and statistics after persistently low inflows were detected in the years preceding reservoir failure autocorrelation and rescaled range analyses were performed in the inflow series confirming the presence of long term process ltp hurst coefficient 0 655 reservoir reliability was then reassessed for the pre failure period 1986 2016 using three storage yield reliability s y r methods and ltp statistics the reassessed pre failure reservoir reliability was 96 05 very close to the observed post failure reliability 96 87 estimated by mass balance analysis the 3 difference observed between the reliabilities using classical and ltp statistics resulted from a higher standard deviation in the reservoir inflows capturing the long term variability not evident in the classical analysis if persistence occurs in inflows reservoir reliability could be assessed using a similar approach improving reservoir behavior forecast and management keywords reliability reservoir inflows hurst phenomenon 1 introduction the operational reliability of a reservoir is an index indicating how satisfactorily it meets the water demand without failure carty and cunnane 1990 pegram 1980 some water supply reservoirs have failed even when their reliabilities were close to 100 due to extreme events such as long droughts moy et al 1986 in the design of water supply reservoirs storage yield reliability s y r equations are traditionally used to determine a reservoir capacity s required to deliver a yield y with a given reliability r kuria and vogel 2014 s y r equations are useful not only for reservoir design but also for reservoir behavior forecasting where observed hydrologic data instead of synthetic series are used kuria and vogel 2015 reservoirs are often built using incomplete hydrological information which introduces uncertainty into their future operation wallis and o connell 1973 even for large streamflow series vogel et al 1998 the conclusion that stationary values of reservoir storage capacities are only obtained with simulations using inflow sequences of 1000 years or more pretto et al 1997 is a strong evidence of that incompleteness additionally the natural trends observed in many streamflow time series e g burn et al 2008 which are enhanced by climate change mateus and tullos 2016 gersonius et al 2013 also affect reservoir capacity design and operational reliability soundharajan et al 2016 because of this variability some authors question the assumption of streamflow stationarity in reservoir design and operation milly et al 2008 although water supply reservoirs are expected to operate under fixed drafts pretto et al 1997 variable water demand patterns may also impact reservoir operational reliability moy et al 1986 simonovic 1987 furthermore the intrinsic processes governing streamflow variability including those related to long memory persistence also add to the uncertainty affecting reservoir reliability klemes et al 1981 persistence is a long term statistical property of a time series such as streamflow where low flow periods follow other low flow periods in a cluster the same occurring with high flow periods papamichail and geourgiou 2001 long term process ltp in reservoir inflows can be assessed by the hurst h coefficient hurst 1956 and occurs if 0 5 h 1 0 davies and harte 1987 karamouz and houck 1982 found evidence of ltp in the inflow series of three american reservoirs with h varying from 0 69 to 0 76 in india jain and bhunya 2008 reported a reduction of 10 in reservoir reliability under the presence of long term persistence h 0 74 in the inflow data compared to that of an independent inflow series considering that most of the existing reservoirs were designed and are operated with limited streamflow records bhattacharya et al 1983 kuria and vogel 2014 and since persistence is often present in inflow series wallis and o connell 1973 it not surprising that water supply reservoirs designed and operated with 100 reliability have failed cheng et al 2017 due to unaccounted uncertainties the descoberto reservoir in central brazil failed to meet the water demand in 2017 in spite of its 100 operational reliability immediately prior to failure adasa 2016 the objective of this paper was to examine if persistence in the inflows contributed to the failure of the descoberto reservoir and to reassess the pre failure reservoir reliability using different s y r methods and ltp statistics which could allow the timely adoption of preventive measures 2 materials and methods 2 1 the descoberto reservoir the descoberto is an unregulated reservoir located in central brazil supplying water to 2 million people in brazil s capital brasilia fig 1 the reservoir s hydrologic characteristics are presented in table 1 the reservoir has no major abstractions upstream and mean annual precipitation in its drainage basin is 1400 mm yr 1 although water demand never exceeded the firm yield during the reservoir s 31 yr operational period adasa 2016 a series of six sequential low annual inflows in the last years of the series all below the long term mean led to an operational failure in 2017 to avoid a collapse in the city s water supply water managers established a 30 water rationing scheme throughout the 2017 reducing the reservoir draft from 5 2 to 3 5 m3 s 1 2 2 reservoir reliability using mass balance analysis to assess the failure frequency and the actual reliability of the descoberto reservoir during its operational life 1986 2017 the concatenated behavior analysis cba pretto et al 1997 a mass balance equation of inflows and outflows from a finite storage was applied on a yearly basis starting with a full reservoir in the end of 1985 considering that the reservoir storage at any time t is limited between zero dead storage and c reservoir capacity the reservoir water balance equation is koutsoyiannis 2005 pretto et al 1997 1 st max 0 min st 1 xt dt c where st reservoir volume at the end of year t 106 m3 st 1 reservoir volume at the end of year t 1 106 m3 xt inflow at year t adjusted

after the cba was performed in the descoberto reservoir the probability of failure pf in a given year was estimated by pretto et al 1997 4 pf t p dt st 1 xt the reservoir probability of failure during its operational period was obtained by dividing the number of years in which the required water demand could not be supplied nf by the number of years in the total sequence n jain and bhunya 2008 namely 5 pf nf n the time based reliability r is simply the reciprocal of pf harr 1987 namely 6 r 1 pf the probability of failure of a reservoir pf in eq 6 is often used as a proxy of risk risk in turn is the product of hazard and vulnerability and resilience can be described as the societal capacity of coping with risk ganoulis 2009 the cba was applied to the descoberto reservoir and the corresponding reliability was calculated for the following operating periods without 1986 2016 and with 1986 2017 failure since the cba is a mass conservation equation and since actual hydrologic series was used in the computations the cba based reliability was considered the actual observed reservoir reliability in the present study 2 3 reservoir reliability using s y r equations in order to realistically assess reservoir behavior and reliability in the period immediately prior to failure 1986 2016 which would allow the adoption of preventive measures in a timely manner three robust s y r methods were utilized using both classical and ltp statistics the s y r methods used were i the conceptual gould dincer model mcmahon et al 2007 ii the empirical kuria vogel s y r equation kuria and vogel 2014 and iii harr s 1987 stochastic capacity demand model the gould dincer g d equation was developed using a wide spectrum of global hydrology mcmahon et al 2007 and estimates the reservoir capacity required to meet a demand with a probability of non exceedance of inflows equivalent to the mean first passage time from a full to an empty reservoir the equation for the normal g d equation with autocorrelation in inflows after isolating the standard normal variate of non exceedance is mcmahon et al 2007 7 z p 4 c 1 1 r 1 v 2 μ 1 r 1 where zp standard normal variate associated with the

descoberto reservoir capacity was taken as its active volume c 86 0 106 m3 and the reservoir firm yield obtained previously by sequence peak analysis was taken as y 163 4 106 m3yr 1 adasa 2016 in harr s stochastic capacity demand model the safety margin of a system reservoir is a function of the normalized difference between mean water availability capacity and the mean water requirement demand which are random variables and often correlated in this model the standardized normal variate zs of the system s safety margin during the operational period is harr 1987 9 z s c s d s s 2 c s s 2 d s

and r correlation coefficient between capacity and demand in the present study capacity was the total water availability at time t st 1 xt in 106 m3 and demand was the total water demand at time t dt in 106 m3 once the zp and zs values in eqs 7 8 were computed using the dg n and the kuria vogel models respectively the reservoir probability of failure pf was estimated by 10 pf norm dist p z where norm dist p z probability of the standardized normal variate zp or zs obtained from an electronic spreadsheet in the case of harr s capacity demand model eq 9 the probability of failure pf was obtained by harr 1987 11 pf 0 5 norm dist p zr 2 reservoir reliability for the three s y r models was calculated with eq 6 considering the pre failure operational period 1986 2016 and using both classical and ltp statistics see section below the r values calculated using the three s y r relationships were then compared to the actual observed post failure reliability obtained with the cba analysis to assess the ability of the former in forecasting reservoir behavior before failure 2 4 statistical analyses of the reservoir time series classical statistics such as the mean standard deviation coefficient of variation and distribution skewness were computed for the record samples of yearly inflows demands and water availabilities considering the periods without 1986 2016 n 31 and with failure 1986 2017 n 32 since the s y r models required normality in the distributions of inflows xt water availabilities st 1 xt and water demands dt these series were tested for normality using the kolmogorov smirnov test haan 1994 additionally the occurrence of significant trends or shifts in the time series of xt dt and st 1 xt was examined using the mann kendall test burn et al 2008 to assess long term persistence in the hydrologic records the autocorrelation and the adjusted rescaled range tests were performed in the inflow and water availability time series the sample autocorrelation function acf was calculated by the following equations salas 1992 12 rk ck co 13 c k 1 n t 1 n k x t k x x t x where rk autocorrelation coefficient of lag k xt inflow observation at time t and x inflow mean when the correlogram of rk versus the lag k decays rapidly to zero after one or two lags it is an indication of short memory in the series while a slower decay indicates persistency or long memory salas 1992 the rescaled range test for the hurst effect in the inflow series was calculated using the mandelbrot and wallis 1969 method and subsequently adjusted for finite samples by hamed s 2007 procedure taking sr t d as the standard deviation of the observations from time t to time t d 1 r t d as the minimum reservoir size required over the same period and xj as the river annual inflows mandelbrot and wallis 1969 we have 14 s r t d j 1 t d 1 x j 2 d x t d 2 15 r t d m a x 1 u d j 1 t u 1 x j u x t d m i n 1 u d j 1 t u 1 x j u x t d where 16 x t d xi xt d 1 d the ratio r t d sr t d is the rescaled range the rescaled range test consists in averaging the values of r sr for a number of values of t for a given value of d and plotting the average result q d against log d the slope of the graph of q d versus log d found using ordinary linear regression is the hurst coefficient h mandelbrot and wallis 1969 if h is approximately 0 5 the series presents white noise but if 0 5 h 1 the series shows fractional gaussian noise or long term persistence davies and harte 1987 the rescaled range r sr analysis is considered a robust statistic for testing the presence of long term persistence and its intensity in the time series particularly with respect to long tailed distributions beran 1992 however the r sr method can be biased particularly when samples are small hamed 1997 therefore the biased h values of the inflow and water availability series obtained by the r sr method were adjusted using hamed s 2007 procedure which consists of a modified expression of the expected value of the rescaled range the bias in the hurst coefficient calculated with the r sr method using a finite sample is hamed 2007 17 bias h h h bh a nh b where h biased hurst coefficient calculated by the r sr method h unbiased hurst coefficient n number of observation in the series and a b are coefficients of a linear regression equation used to estimate the expected value of r sr hamed 2007 once h and the corresponding bias were obtained the unbiased h was calculated using eq 17 according to hamed 2007 h only becomes asymptotic unbiased when n 1000 reinforcing the need of h adjustment in the present study n 32 due to low frequency fluctuations in the unknown long term series of inflows its variance σ2 is potentially higher than that of the finite 32 yr long series s2 estimated by classical statistics koutsoyiannis 2003 since reservoir reliability depends on inflow variance eqs 7 9 the latter was calculated for the reservoir inflow xt and water availability st 1 xt series using both classical and ltp statistics in the case of classical statistics sample variance is simply 18 s 2 x 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 where s2 x variance of the inflow series xi inflow in year i 106 m3 yr 1 x mean annual inflow 106 m3 yr 1 and n number of years in the series since the scale of the aggregated stochastic process is unknown the ltp inflow variance was estimated from the variance of the inflow means after the unbiased hurst coefficient was obtained as opposed to the variance of the mean in the classical statistics given by the ratio of the sample variance and the number of observations in the sample the variance of the mean in the ltp process depends on the hurst coefficient beran 1994 koutsoyiannis 2003 19 var x h s2 n2 2h where var x h variance of the inflow mean in the ltp s2 sample variance n number of observations and h hurst coefficient the standard error of the mean sem is simply the square root of the variance of the mean i e s n classical statistics and s n2 2h ltp statistics dividing the latter by the former one obtains a coefficient representing the number of times that the ltp sem is greater than the classical sem koutsoyiannis 2003 this coefficient was used to multiply the sample standard deviation s and obtain the ltp standard deviation sh assuming that the increase in the sem came from an increased variance of the aggregated ltp series 3 results and discussion 3 1 reservoir hydrology statistics the annual inflows water demands and storages of the descoberto reservoir during the period 1986 2017 are presented in fig 2 this figure shows

significant additionally a significant decreasing trend was observed in water availability in the 1986 2017 series due to the low inflow and reduced reservoir storage in 2017 although the mean draft

it means that the reservoir could fail once every 30 years an unacceptable scenario for most water users considering that the 100 reliability yield was never exceeded during the reservoir operational

analysis the reliability of the descoberto reservoir would be overestimated by 0 6 a potential bias recognized earlier by harr 1987 the results of the present study showed that the incorporation of ltp statistics in reservoir reliability analysis estimated by appropriate s y r methods significantly improved reservoir behavior forecast prior to failure when persistence was present in the inflow records hence if one suspects that ltp occurs in inflow series of similar reservoirs the present approach could help prevent operational failures by allowing the adoption of precautionary measures such as draft reduction vogel et al 2007 and variable reservoir curves mateus and tullos 2016 4 conclusions despite mass balance analyses using classical statistics indicated a failure free condition in 2016 the descoberto reservoir failed in 2017 underestimating actual post failure reliability by 3 the leading cause of failure was the persistence of low inflows during the last 6 years of the series depleting the reservoir storage aggravated by an increasing trend in the reservoir draft ratio after acf and rescaled range analyses indicated the presence of persistence in both inflow and water availability series with hurst coefficients of 0 655 and 0 694 respectively the mean reservoir reliability estimated by three s y r methods in the period prior to failure was 96 05 very close to the actual post failure cba reliability 96 87 the difference between the s y r reliabilities using classical and ltp statistics resulted from a higher inflow standard deviation in the latter capturing the long term variability not evident in the classical analysis the results in the present study indicate that if persistence occurs in inflows reservoir reliability could be adequately assessed by s y r models and ltp statistics improving reservoir behavior forecast the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing

8414,study region upper madeira basin 975 500 km2 in southern amazonia which is suffering a biophysical transition involving deforestation and changes in rainfall regime study focus the evolution of the runoff coefficient rc runoff rainfall is examined as an indicator of the environmental changes 1982 2017 new hydrological insights for the region at an annual scale the rc at porto velho station declines while neither the basin averaged rainfall nor the runoff change during the low water period rc and runoff diminish while no changes are observed in rainfall this cannot be explained by increase of evapotranspiration since the basin averaged actual evapotranspiration decreases to explain the decrease of rc a regional analysis is undertaken while the characteristic rainfall runoff time lag ct at porto velho basin is estimated to 60 days ct is higher 65 75 days in the south and lower 50 days over the amazon andes transition regions it is found that 1 the southern basin south of 14 s best explains low level porto velho runoff 2 in the south rainfall diminishes and the frequency of dry days increases both features explain the diminution of the runoff and the rc in porto velho moreover the increasing dryness in the south compensates for the rainfall and frequency of wet days 10 mm increase north of 14 s and explains the lack of basin averaged rainfall trends of the upper madeira basin keywords runoff coefficient rainfall trends atmosphere and land surface interactions 1 introduction the upper madeira basin at porto velho extends over 975 500 km2 and is characterized by an altitude variation from 50 to 6450 masl setting the scene for a wide range of climatic geomorphological and biological features the hydrological basin at porto velho station mean annual discharge of 18 300 m3 s molina carpio et al 2017 extends in peru 11 of its surface in bolivia 73 and in brazil 16 the basin is divided into four main geomorphological units the andes the brazilian shield the amazon plain and the fitzcarrald arch formation fig 1 a the madeira river basin at porto velho station consists of four main tributaries madre de dios arriving from the peruvian andes beni and mamoré from the central bolivian andes and the guaporé river from the southeastern part of the basin brazilian shield while the andes cover around 23 of the upper madeira surface a vast floodplain the llanos de mojos extends over the lowlands between the beni mamoré and guaporé rivers guyot 1993 1996 the llanos de mojos floodplain is characterized by a mean altitude of 150 masl a slope of less than 10 cm km guyot 1993 and a floodable surface up to 150 000 km2 hamilton et al 2004 ovando et al 2016 parrens et al 2019 among others rainfall over the upper madeira basin shows a strong spatial variability with average annual values of around 1800 mm year or 5 mm day while lower values are observed in the southernmost part of the basin and over the andes fig 1b roche et al 1990 molina carpio et al 2017 the andes amazon transition region of the upper madeira basin is among the rainiest regions of the world characterized by the interactions between large scale winds circulation and the topography that determine a complex rainfall distribution e g killeen et al 2007 bookhagen and strecker 2008 espinoza et al 2009a orographic effects and exposure to easterly winds produce a strong annual rainfall gradient between the lowlands and the andes that can reach 190 mm km indeed rainfall hotspot regions with 4000 to 6000 mm year 12 16 mm day are identified at low elevations in the andean foothills 400 700 masl and in windward conditions e g espinoza et al 2015 junquas et al 2018 these very wet regions are observed particularly over the upper madre de dios beni and mamoré rivers fig 1 based on the 1968 1982 period roche 1990 used empirical equations and estimated the surface water balance at an annual scale over the upper madeira basin obtaining an average precipitation of 4 98 mm day a mean runoff at porto velho of 1 78 mm day and a mean evapotranspiration of 3 21 mm day computing the surface water balance with evapotranspiration data from different sources builes jaramillo and poveda 2018 show a state close to balance within a 10 tolerance in the madeira basin however a large negative residual is reported in the upper beni river at rurrenabaque station probably related to uncertainties in evapotranspiration products sörensson and ruscica 2018 getirana et al 2014 and underestimation of rainfall over the amazon andes transition region espinoza et al 2015 the southern amazon basin including the upper madeira is characterized by a wet season in the austral summer december march related to the presence of the south atlantic convergence zone sacz during the mature phase of the south america monsoon system sams e g vera et al 2006 marengo et al 2012 in absence of the sams a marked dry season predominates during the austral winter june august in terms of basin average over 50 of the annual rainfall is recorded between december march e g roche 1990 ronchail and gallaire 2006 however over the rainfall hotspot region in the upper madre de dios basin exceptional rainfall also occurs during the austral dry season estimated to be around 1000 mm during june august in the san gabán meteorological station espinoza et al 2015 rainfall seasonality drives runoff and terrestrial water storage tws variability over the basin indeed molina carpio et al 2017 shows a time lag of two month between basin averaged rainfall and runoff at porto velho in addition using satellite information of tws from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace at 1 x1 of resolution a time lag of two months has been detected between rainfall and tws in the madeira basin e g xavier et al 2010 frappart et al 2013 with a seasonal range of around 4 5 mm day azarderakhsh et al 2011 recent studies have documented an intensification of the seasonal extreme hydrological events over the amazon basin e g marengo and espinoza 2016 barichivich et al 2018 espinoza et al 2019 in the madeira basin severe flooding occurred for instance in 1992 1993 1997 ronchail et al 2005 bourrel et al 2009 2007 2008 and recently exceptional rainfall and discharge values were reported in 2014 espinoza et al 2014 ovando et al 2016 which do not always coincide with those that occurred in the main stem of the amazon river molina carpio et al 2017 in terms of hydrological impacts large floods are also intensified by the superimposition of flood waves from major tributaries of the upper madeira river ovando et al 2016 several studies have reported that discharge during the low water season in the southwestern amazon including the porto velho station exhibited a significant decrease during the last four decades espinoza et al 2009b lopes et al 2016 molina carpio et al 2017 wongchuig correa et al 2017 in the southern part of the amazon basin a longer shorter dry wet season has been reported specifically since the 1980s e g salazar et al 2007 marengo et al 2011 saatchi et al 2013 fu et al 2013 arias et al 2015 debortoli et al 2015 in a recent study espinoza et al 2019 documented a significant increase of the dry day frequency ddf for the 1981 2017 period particularly over the bolivian amazon during the beginning of the wet season september november in addition future climate scenarios suggest that this region could suffer an intensification of extreme droughts boisier et al 2015 guimberteau et al 2013 polade et al 2014 in addition to the above described changes in rainfall intensity over southern amazonia recent modeling studies suggest that southern amazonia is suffering a process of biophysical transition two possible tipping points have been identified associated with temperature increase of 4 c or with deforestation exceeding 40 of the forest area surpassing these typing points large scale savannization of almost the entire southern and eastern amazon including madeira basin may take place nobre et al 2016 indeed a fragile hydrological equilibrium has been identified in southern amazon which can be broken during drought events producing persistent changes in rainforest canopy structure maeda et al 2015 total deforestation in amazonia now reaches 20 of the area and is particularly extended over the arc of deforestation in the southern and southwestern amazonia nobre et al 2016 these environmental changes could substantially impact the hydrological cycle in the southwestern amazon basin where the recycling of water from the central and eastern amazon rainforest is particularly significant zemp et al 2017 sumila et al 2017 staal et al 2018 marengo et al 2018 that is both climatic and environmental changes in southern amazonia during the last four decades have been established by the above mentioned scientific literature an important indicator of environmental changes in a basin frequently used in hydro climatic studies is the runoff coefficient rc runoff rainfall which embeds climate and or land use changes e g xu et al 2018 in this study we aim to assess the evolution of the runoff coefficient for the 1982 2017 period in the upper madeira basin annual and seasonal rc is analyzed in relation to the spatio temporal variability of the main components of the hydrological cycle rainfall and evapotranspiration the description of the hydroclimatic data and statistical methods is proposed in sections 2 and 3 respectively and the long term surface water balance for the upper madeira basin is calculated in section 4 with the aim of depicting the rc evolution over the basin the interannual evolution of both basin averaged rainfall and runoff at porto velho station is analyzed in section 5 given the geomorphological and climatic complexity of the upper madeira basin we seek to understand how the regional variability of precipitation within the basin can affect the evolution of rc section 6 to this end section 6 1 is devoted to analyze spatial variations in the characteristic rainfall runoff time lag in the basin and how this feature may affect the seasonal relationship between regional precipitation and runoff at porto velho regional trends in precipitation are analyzed in section 6 2 to understand how changes in regional precipitation can affect rc variability over the basin finally concluding remarks are presented in section 7 2 hydro climatic data 2 1 runoff time series in the upper madeira basin in this study daily runoff r discharge data is analyzed on the upper madeira river at porto velho and abunã hydrological stations covering drainage areas of 975 500 km2 and 920 100 km2 respectively fig 1a daily discharge time series were provided by the brazilian water national office agencia nacional de águas ana and quality control was checked by the sno hybam observatory for more details see molina carpio et al 2017 discharge data used in this study corresponds to the 1981 2017 period however due to missing values annual and june july discharges in 2011 at porto velho are not taken into account and 1992 1999 2001 annual values in abunã are removed from our analysis in order to compare the discharge with other hydrological variables discharge is converted to daily runoff mm day for both stations 2 2 daily rainfall datasets 2 2 1 the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps the chirps daily precipitation p dataset is based on global cold cloud duration as a primary source for calculating precipitation at a global scale then these estimations are calibrated with the precipitation estimated from the trmm 3b42 v7 product and rainfall data from the global rain gauges network finally a high spatial resolution rainfall dataset is provided at 0 05 0 05 of horizontal resolution funk et al 2015 in this study the original resolution of chirps is used for the 1981 2017 period this information is available at http chg geog ucsb edu data chirps 2 2 2 interpolated hybam observed precipitation data hop daily hop rainfall data set is based on 752 rain gauges provided by national agencies responsible for hydro meteorological monitoring in the amazonian countries ana in brazil senamhi in peru and bolivia inamhi in ecuador and ideam in colombia espinoza et al 2009a guimberteau et al 2012 hop data is spatially interpolated to a 1 1 horizontal resolution for more details about the ability of the interpolated hop data to reproduce hydrological variability in the amazon river see guimberteau et al 2012 and guimberteau et al 2013 satellite based precipitation products like chirps have been validated in the amazon basin with the hop data set at interannual and intraseasonal time scales and also for the daily rainfall extremes by wongchuig correa et al 2017 paccini et al 2017 espinoza et al 2019 among others daily interpolated hop data are freely available in netcdf format on the http www ore hybam org web site 2 3 evapotranspiration we use the actual evapotranspiration e product gleamv3 2a miralles et al 2011 martens et al 2017 downloaded from https www gleam eu downloads gleam global land evaporation amsterdam model estimates the potential evapotranspiration through the priestly and taylor equation and uses a set of algorithms that calculates the different components of e separately transpiration interception bare soil open water evaporation and sublimation using meteorological and vegetation data as input the precipitation input to gleamv3 2a is mswep v1 0 beck et al 2017 which is a multisource merged product based on in situ remote sensed and reanalysis data four types of land covers are possible in gleamv3 2a bare soil low vegetation tall vegetation and open water the vegetation cover is produced using the modis product mod44b and is therefore static however the variations in vegetation status is considered in the stress factor used to convert potential e to actual e which is based on remote sensed vegetation optical index from cci lprm liu et al 2013 and soil moisture both from remote sensing esa cci sm v2 3 liu et al 2012 and land reanalysis gldas noah rodell et al 2004 products assimilated into the gleam multi layer soil model the upper madeira basin belongs to the southern amazon region where the uncertainty of gridded e estimates from different sources such as remote sensing data and land reanalysis is high sörensson and ruscica 2018 in part because of lack of basic understanding of the processes governing e in this region christoffersen et al 2014 getirana et al 2014 sun et al 2019 however since we study a closed basin we are able to choose the e dataset that best closes the annual water budget comparing rainfall to addition of runoff and e for the period 1982 2017 not shown 2 4 terrestrial water storage from the grace mission the equivalent water thickness estimated by the grace data is used as proxy of the tws in the upper madeira basin the grace consists of twin satellites that measure changes in the earth s gravity field due to displacement of water air or land masses many studies have shown the capacity of grace to depict continental water storage variations at large spatial scales tapley et al 2004 ramillien et al 2008 as well as for validation purposes into hydrological models getirana et al 2011 paiva et al 2013 siqueira et al 2018 it is important to note that the equivalent water thickness values are not absolute values of water storage in fact these are anomalies relative to the 2004 2009 time mean baseline swenson and wahr 2006 in this study we use the rl05 level 3 version of monthly time variable gravity data with spherical harmonic coefficients up to one degree which has a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 with a monthly time step we use three 3 products of equivalent water thickness all based on the grace gravimeter raw data but developed by different research centres and laboratories the jet propulsion laboratory jpl the university of texas center for space research csr and the geoforschungszentrum gfz potsdam the rl05 data used in this work are 159 month csr jpl and gfz data from april 2002 to january 2017 the data are available at https podaac jpl nasa gov dataset tellus land nc rl05 in this study we use the term tws as the mean of equivalent water thickness from the three products as recommended by sakumura et al 2014 spatially averaged over the upper madeira basin at porto velho station thus changes in tws represent the basin average change in water storage over the basin on a monthly time scale for more details about the grace data and their applications in the amazon basin see papa et al 2008 chen et al 2010 xavier et al 2010 frappart et al 2012 2013 among others 2 5 topography data from digital elevation model dem in this study we use the freely available 90 m dem from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm v4 1 farr et al 2007 available at http srtm csi cgiar org srtmdata this information has been used to determine landscape morphology the main fluvial network the longitudinal slopes of the main rivers and the distance of each point of the river to the porto velho station a summary of the dataset used to assess the regional hydro climatic changes in the southern amazon basin is presented in table s1 3 statistical methods linear correlation is conducted in order to analyze the relationship between rainfall and runoff for this purpose the parametric pearson coefficient r is computed using significance at least at p 0 05 the seasonal variation coefficient svc of rainfall defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of monthly values to the mean of monthly values 1982 2017 was also calculated for each of the grid points defined by chirps high low values of svc represent strong weak rainfall seasonality i e high low differences between dry and wet seasons espinoza et al 2009a the characteristic rainfall runoff time lag over the basin is an indicator of the mean travel time of the streamflow wave through the catchment this characteristic time lag ct is defined as the time lag of runoff in days necessary to obtain the maximum coefficient of correlation between rainfall and runoff ct is obtained maximizing r in r pi ri ct where r is the pearson coefficient of correlation between p and r pi is rainfall on the day i and ri ct is the runoff on the day i considering a lag of ct days in addition the runoff coefficient rc r p is defined as the ratio between runoff observed in a hydrological station in this study porto velho or abunã and the spatially averaged rainfall over the basin rc is analyzed at annual and seasonal time scales finally in order to compute the interannual evolution of the hydro climatic variables trends and break points are analyzed in the september to august november to october annual averages of p r to identify trends in the hydroclimatic time series we use rank based non parametric kendall test τ kendall 1975 breaks and changes in the series are evaluated using the pettitt method pettitt 1979 a non parametric test based on changes in the average and the range of the time series subdivided into sub series these methods have been applied widely in hydroclimatologic studies and are considered among of the most complete tests for time series analysis e g zbigniew 2004 4 seasonality and long term trends of the surface water balance the wet season in the upper madeira basins coincides with the mature phase of the sams from december to march with mean rainfall values higher than 6 mm day over the 1982 2017 period blue line in fig 2 fig 1b displays the mean annual rainfall values while the strength of the seasonal cycle can be described with the seasonal coefficient of variability scv displayed in fig 1c maximum daily rainfall occurs during december through february especially during january and february over the upper part of the madre de dios beni and mamoré basins characterized by the presence of rainfall hotspot regions where more than 16 mm day are reported fig 1e dry conditions are clearly identified during june august season around 1 mm day at a basin average scale fig 2 and table 1 during this season rainfall is near to zero in the andean part of the basin higher than 3000 masl around 2 mm day in the lowlands and around 1 mm day in the upper guaporé basin fig 1g in the upper madre de dios basin however rainfall can reach 9 mm day in the peruvian hotspot as reported in previous studies see introduction scv is high over the bolivian andean region scv 0 9 and over the lower guaporé and mamoré rivers scv 0 7 low scv values are observed over the amazon andes transition region scv 0 6 probably related to the presence of the intense rainfall over the hotspot regions noticeable during all the seasons fig 1d g at an annual scale the mean rainfall value over the upper madeira basin computed for the 1982 2017 period is 4 27 mm day table 1 associated with the above described rainfall regime runoff annual cycle in porto velho shows maximum minimum values between march april september october approximately two months after the respective maximum and minimum rainfall values black line in fig 2 according to table 1 runoff values vary from 0 52 mm day in august october to 3 09 mm day in february april and the mean annual value is estimated in 1 71 mm day based on these values the mean annual runoff coefficient rc estimated in the upper madeira basin for the 1982 2017 period is 0 40 table 1 at the seasonal scale rc varies from 0 39 and 0 40 in the transitional and wet season respectively to 0 53 in the dry season however annual rc is closer to rc during the wet season probably related to the weight of this season in the annual water balance the same analysis is carried out for mean annual rainfall and runoff at abunã station upstream of porto velho station fig 1a where rc is estimated to 0 38 at the scale of the upper madeira basin at porto velho these results are slightly higher than those provided for the 1968 1982 period by roche 1990 where a rc of 0 35 is estimated with mean rainfall and runoff values of 4 98 mm day and 1 78 mm day respectively both rainfall and runoff are higher in roche et al 1990 particularly the former which could be partially explained by the differences in the analyzed period and the use of different rainfall data sets actual evapotranspiration estimated by gleam shows lower seasonality than rainfall and runoff red line in fig 2 with maximum minimum values during december march june august corresponding to 3 9 mm day and 2 0 mm day respectively the seasonal cycle coincides well with the estimation of sun et al 2019 who used a water budget approach for the whole madeira basin in particular a distinctive characteristic present in both sun et al 2019 and gleama data is that the annual cycle has its minimum value in june which is a dry month this is a feature that has been observed in recent studies and can probably be explained by plant phenology e g wu et al 2016 commonly not present in land surface model based e estimates e g sörensson and ruscica 2018 the mean actual evapotranspiration for the 1982 2017 period estimated over the upper madeira basin is 2 90 mm day table 1 lower annual values are observed over the andean region 1 5 mm day and in the southernmost madeira basin 2 mm day in contrast higher e estimations are observed over the amazon andes transition region and in the northern part of the basin where e is around 4 mm day not shown this spatial pattern of e is coherent with previous studies that used several e data sources e g paca et al 2019 based on these estimations the surface water budget in the upper madeira basin computed as p r e using the long term mean values of precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration respectively is 0 34 mm day equivalent to 8 of the mean annual rainfall which is close to balance within tolerance 10 according to previous studies e g builes jaramillo and poveda 2017 uncertainties in evapotranspiration are a possible source of this imbalance however recent studies have documented a rainfall underestimation in the interpolated and satellite based rainfall estimations particularly in the amazon andes transition region such as the upper beni and the madre de dios river basins builes jaramillo and poveda 2018 espinoza et al 2015 the monthly surface water budget monthly p e r and the monthly changes in terrestrial water storage tws from the grace mission grey bars and dotted blue line in fig 2 respectively are used as indicators of the state of the surface water soil moisture and groundwater in the upper madeira basin during the hydrological year both data sources show positive negative values from october march april september which suggest that the soil is recharged with water during the august february season while during march to june the water storage is depleted it is important to note that tws shows a higher seasonality comparing to the monthly surface water budget which is partially explained by the shorter tws period 2002 2017 where several extreme floods e g 2014 2015 and droughts e g 2005 2010 2016 have been reported in the upper madeira basin indeed a better match between the monthly surface water budget and tws is obtained when values for the common 2002 2017 period are computed not shown in particular the monthly surface water budget for the 2002 2017 period shows higher values during the december february wet season reaching 2 7 mm day in february instead of 2 0 mm day and 2 3 mm day in december instead of 1 9 mm day 5 interannual evolution of the runoff rainfall relationship as described above fig 2 shows a lag of around two months between runoff and rainfall annual cycles in order to estimate the characteristic rainfall runoff time lag ct at a basin scale over the upper madeira we compute a lagged correlation between daily rainfall and runoff fig 3 a ct is computed using both chirps and hop spatially averaged daily rainfall products see section 3 the maximum coefficient of correlation between daily rainfall and runoff is obtained using 60 days lag for both products thus fig 3a confirms that the mean ct for the upper madeira basin is around two months in both cases using chirps and hop the evolution of r values shows similar shapes with a strong increase in the first 10 days of runoff lag from 0 25 to 0 40 fig 3a based on the 60 days of ct and on the onset of the wet season in september that defines the beginning of the hydrological year fig 2 the september to august november to october annual averages of p r is analyzed fig 3b in addition when a seasonal analysis is conducted september to november november to january is used to define the onset of the sams season and june to august august to october is used to define the dry season for rainfall runoff the coefficient of correlation r p r between the mean annual runoff and rainfall is 0 71 fig 3b and table 1 which varies from 0 45 during the dry season to 0 73 during the onset of the sams table 1 these correlations are significant at p 0 001 at annual time scale no significant trend is detected in either rainfall or runoff over the upper madeira however a significant diminution of evapotranspiration τ e is identified p 0 001 with a break point in 1995 p 0 05 and lower values afterwards table 1 nevertheless in terms of absolute values the detected e diminution plays a minor role in the basin water balance indeed the 1982 2017 standard deviation of e is lower 0 07 mm day than the standard deviations of rainfall 0 38 mm day and runoff 0 31 mm day and e diminishes from 2 93 mm day during the 1980s to 2 88 mm day during the 21st century which corresponds to 2 of mean annual p in order to evaluate changes in the runoff rainfall relationship over the upper madeira basin the interannual evolution of rc is estimated using chirps and hop rainfall data sets averaged over the porto velho and abunã basins and runoff estimated at the same two stations figs 4 a and 4b respectively in all the cases a significant diminution of rc is detected for the 1982 2017 period p 0 05 which cannot be directly explained by the significant diminution of actual evapotranspiration indeed diminution trend in rc is usually associated with an increase of water losses in the annual budget such as increases of evapotranspiration considering a seasonal analysis of rc a significant diminution p 0 05 is only observed during the dry season fig 4c and significant diminution of evapotranspiration is only observed during december february season table 1 break points are detected in rc at annual time scale and during the dry season in 1998 and 1997 respectively p 0 05 and lower values are observed afterwards on the other hand evapotranspiration shows break points in 1997 p 0 01 and 1995 p 0 05 during the december february and march may seasons respectively table 1 also shows that the interannual variability of rc is particularly modulated by the interannual variability of runoff but not by rainfall interannual variability since the coefficient of correlation between runoff and rc r r rc is significant at p 0 01 regardless of the season while no significant correlation is observed between the interannual variability of rainfall and rc r p rc in coherence with these results and in accordance with previous studies espinoza et al 2009b molina carpio et al 2017a a significant runoff diminution is observed during the low water season august to october and november to january p 0 05 fig 4d and a break point is identified in 1993 in august to october runoff p 0 01 with lower values afterwards table 1 these results suggest a change in the runoff rainfall relationship in the upper madeira basin characterized by a runoff diminution during the low water season that is not observed in the basin averaged rainfall producing a significant diminution of the rc nevertheless evapotranspiration shows a significant diminution particularly during the december to february wet season which seems contradictory with the rc diminution in the upper madeira these results suggest that changes in land surface processes or changes in regional rainfall intensity may impact the observed rc evolution in the following section the regional influence of rainfall on runoff variability at porto velho is analyzed in order to better understand the observed changes in the rainfall runoff relationship 6 regional rainfall influence on runoff at porto velho basin 6 1 regional change in the characteristic rainfall runoff time lag ct and seasonal rainfall runoff relationship considering the large extension of the upper madeira basin 975 500 km2 and the geomorphological and climatic diversity that characterize the basin it is particularly important to analyze the regional rainfall influence on runoff variability computing the regional distribution of the ct over the basin fig 5 a provides an initial overview in this case ct is computed using the significant coefficient of correlation between each the daily rainfall at grid point and the lagged daily runoff at porto velho see section 3 while the mean ct over the basin is estimated to 60 days fig 3a ct over the southern part of the basin particularly south of 14 s is higher than the mean ct reaching 65 75 days fig 5a in particular high ct values are observed over the middle and upper mamoré and guaporé basins upstream of the llanos de mojos floodplain indeed a rapid transition in ct is identified above the 150 masl grey line in fig 5a which correspond to the mean elevation of the llanos de mojos floodplain guyot 1993 thus fig 5a suggests that the llanos de mojos plays a relevant role in modulating the spatial distribution of ct over the upper madeira basin fig 5a also displays low ct values over the amazon andes transition region of the madre de dios and beni rivers these regions are characterized by extreme rainfall values and the presence of steep slopes fig 1 which can explain lower ct values of 50 55 days in order to clarify the spatial distribution of ct over the madeira basin figs 5b and 5c show the variations of geomorphological parameters altitude and slope in relation to ct values along the first 1600 km of the river upstream of porto velho station following the guaporé and beni tributaries for this distances vs ct pairs are computed from fig 5a each 50 km then for each ct at one day of resolution we calculate the mean distance for all the pairs black circles in fig 5b and 5c regarding the guaporé river the mean slope becomes near zero between 400 km and 1050 km from porto velho at around 150 masl which corresponds to the llanos de mojos floodplain downstream of the floodplain between zero and 400 km from porto velho ct is around 55 days but this value increases over the floodplain region to 65 days finally high ct values 65 75 days are observed upstream of the floodplain fig 5b the extension of the floodplain along the beni river is smaller comparing to guaporé river minimal slope is identified between 250 km to 600 km from porto velho and ct over this region is around 60 days fig 5c about 1100 km from porto velho the slope of the beni river increases and the mean river altitude change from 200 masl to 300 masl this region corresponds to the beginning of the rainfall hotspot region and lower ct values are found 45 55 days the influence of the floodplain and the extreme rainfall zones hotspot are also remarkable in the mamoré and madre de dios rivers supplementary figure s1 these results provide new information regarding the spatial distribution of ct over the upper madeira basin and suggest a differentiated regional influence of rainfall on runoff at porto velho indeed rainfall over the hotspot regions show a rapid influence on runoff ct around 45 55 days and rainfall over the southern part of the basin particularly south of the 14 s upstream of the llanos de mojos floodplain shows a delayed influence on runoff ct around 75 days according to the above described results we analyze the annual and seasonal correlation between rainfall in each grid point and runoff at porto velho fig 6 at annual scale rainfall over the middle madre de dios beni and mamoré basins which correspond to the rainiest regions of the basins show a stronger influence on runoff variability fig 6a however rainfall over the southern part of the basin shows low or no significant correlation with runoff at porto velho this behavior is mostly related to the wet season pattern fig 6c with higher correlation values over the middle beni basin during march to may fig 6d rainfall over the lowland is highly correlated to may to july runoff significant values also appear over the southeastern part of the basin mamoré and guaporé basins and no significant correlation is observed over the andean region fig 6d during the dry season and the beginning of the hydrological year rainfall over the southern part of the basin is significantly correlated to runoff particularly over the upper beni mamoré and guaporé basins and in the upper madre de dios during september november season fig 6e and 6b these results show that runoff during the high water period february to april is more dependent on rainfall over the northwestern part of the basin particularly over beni and madre de dios basins and during the low water season august to october runoff is more related to rainfall over the southern part of the basin however the southern part of the basin shows higher ct values 75 days fig 5a suggesting a slow influence of rainfall over this region on runoff at porto velho probably associated with the role of the llanos de mojos floodplain fig 5a and 5b therefore we compute the correlation between spatialized rainfall during a larger season from april to august and runoff during the low water period august to october at porto velho fig 6f the results confirm that rainfall over the southern part of the basin upstream of the llanos de mojos floodplain is significantly correlated to runoff at porto velho during the low water period in addition during the dry season june to august rainfall in the south of 14 s represent 44 of the mean rainfall over the upper madeira basin these results suggest that not only the evolution of the basin areal mean rainfall is important to understand runoff evolution at porto velho but that the analysis on a sub basin scale is also necessary 6 2 changes in regional rainfall patterns in a recent study espinoza et al 2019 show an increase of the dry day frequency ddf defined as the number of days with rainfall 1 mm over the southern amazon basin particularly during the transitional september november season in addition the authors documented a diminution in the frequency of wet days wdf defined as the number of days with rainfall 10 mm during this season in fig 7 we provide a more detailed analysis of the seasonal 1981 2017 evolution of the ddf and wdf over the upper madeira basin using chirps rainfall data over the southern part of the basin particularly south of 14 s a significant diminution of wdf and an increase of ddf are observed suggesting drier conditions over this region this pattern is observed in all the seasons with some specificities for instance diminution of wdf is remarkable along the year with more intensity during september to november and march to may fig 7a and 7e and the increase of ddf is more intense during september to november and december to february over the southern upper madeira basin fig 7b d and f these changes do not occur over the andean beni river basin at rurrenabaque station where no decreasing runoff trends were observed molina carpio et al 2017 moreover during the wet december to february season wdf significantly increase over the northern part of the basin particularly to the north of 14 s fig 7c these results confirm a contrasted evolution of rainfall intensity in the upper madeira basin characterized by increasing wdf in the north particularly during the wet season and decreasing wdf and increasing ddf in the south during the entire hydrological year the regional evolution of total rainfall at annual and seasonal time scales is provided in figs 8 and 9 considering two regions the southern part of the basin south of the 14 s in red and the northern part north of the 14 s in blue these two regions are chosen due to the observed changes in rainfall intensity wdf and ddf fig 7 and based on the differences of the regional ct observed in fig 5a and the seasonal rainfall influence on the runoff at porto velho section 6 1 fig 6 at the annual scale september august rainfall in the northern part of the basin shows a significant increase p 0 05 and no break points are detected table 2 over the southern part of the basin no trend is observed in annual rainfall however rainfall in the south shows a shift in 1991 p 0 05 with lower values after this date table 2 as a consequence the annual difference between rainfall over the northern and southern part of the basin blue bars in fig 8 significantly increase p 0 01 and a shift is detected in 1991 p 0 01 with larger differences after this date table 2 at the annual scale actual evapotranspiration diminishes in the southern part of the basin table 2 p 0 01 and a shift is detected in 1995 p 0 01 four years after the shift observed in rainfall in the south however over the northern part of the basin no evapotranspiration trend or shift is detected at the seasonal scale fig 9 diminution in rainfall over the southern basin is remarkable during september november fig 9a where a negative rainfall trend in the south is detected p 0 1 and a shift is observed in 1991 1992 during december february march may significant at p 0 1 p 0 05 dryer conditions are observed after this date fig 9b and d table 2 these results suggest that runoff diminution observed in porto velho during the low water season is associated with drier condition over the southern part of the basin in particular both the low water time series of runoff and rainfall in the south are characterized by shifts at the beginning of the 1990s tables 1 and 2 with lower values afterwards indeed the shifts detected in low water runoff in 1993 can be associated with the shift detected in rainfall over the southern part of the basin in 1991 92 as documented in section 6 1 and fig 6 rainfall over the southern part of the basin plays a key role to modulate runoff variability at porto velho during the low water period analyzing the coefficient of correlation between rainfall in the northern and southern part of the basin vs runoff at porto velho table 2 shows that seasonal rainfall over both regions are significantly correlated with seasonal runoff except for runoff during the low water season during this season runoff is only significantly correlated to rainfall in the south which is in accordance with fig 6f regarding rainfall in the northern part of the basin a positive trend is detected in december february p 0 1 and a break point is observed in 2002 p 0 05 increase in northern basin december to february rainfall is coherent with the wdf intensification in this region fig 7c which translate in a rainfall increase in the north at the annual scale fig 8 fig 9 and table 2 also document a significant increase of the regional rainfall differences at annual and seasonal scales over the 1983 2017 period difference increase is significant at p 0 01 except for the september to november season that is significant at p 0 05 fig 9 table 2 evapotranspiration in the south significantly diminishes during december to february and march to may p 0 01 and p 0 05 respectively and shifts are observed in 1997 and 1995 respectively with lower values after these dates table 2 that is a few years later than the shift of rainfall in the south 1991 1992 finally evapotranspiration in the north shows a diminution trend during december to february p 0 01 a downward shift in 2007 p 0 05 and an increasing trend during june to august p 0 01 table 2 these results provide new information regarding the spatial rainfall evolution over the upper madeira basin which is a key issue to clarify the reason of the observed changes in the hydrological regime at a basin scale indeed the rc diminution reported in section 5 fig 4a is particularly associated with the runoff diminution during the low water season fig 4d and table 1 and with the diminution in rainfall over the southern part of the basin particularly after 1991 92 however during the wet season total rainfall and wdf significantly increase over the northern part of the basin an increase that also is perceptible at the annual scale the increase in precipitation in the north and the decrease in the south are compensated at the basin scale where no trend is detected in annual rainfall and runoff however this contrasted rainfall evolution has significantly impacted the rainfall seasonality over the basin and the evolution of rc in addition associated with rainfall diminution and ddf increase in the southern part of the basin a significant diminution in evapotranspiration has been detected over this region while annual rainfall in the south shifted in 1991 and drier conditions are observed after this date annual evapotranspiration in the south shifted in 1995 and lower values are observed after this date diminution in actual evapotranspiration in the southern madeira can be related to a diminution in rainfall over this region and or a reduction of the tropical forest as documented in previous studies see introduction 7 conclusions and final comments during the last four decades scientific literature has documented climatic and environmental changes in southern amazonia including the upper madeira basin 975 500 km2 in this study we document that the runoff coefficient rc runoff rainfall in the upper madeira basin an indicator of environmental changes over the basin decreases during the 1982 2017 period and in particular during the dry season rc diminution is associated with a significant runoff diminution p 0 05 during the low water season august to october however in terms of basin averaged rainfall no trend is detected therefore an analysis at the basin scale is not satisfactory to explain the changes observed in rc and is a first argument for developing an analysis at the sub regional level initially we provide a comprehensive analysis of the surface water budget over the basin using i daily runoff r at porto velho and abunã stations ii daily rainfall p iii evapotranspiration e and iv terrestrial water storage tws the surface water balance for the 1982 2017 period shows an imbalance of 0 34 mm day equivalent to 8 of the mean annual p which is acceptable according to previous studies over the amazon basin the mean characteristic rainfall runoff time lag ct into the basin which is an indicator of the mean travel time of the streamflow wave through the catchment is estimated to 60 days considering the basin averaged p and r in porto velho however ct is higher 65 75 days in the southern part of the basin upstream of the llanos de mojos floodplain and lower 50 days over the amazon andes transition regions characterized by extreme rainfall values and high slopes these results confirm that a regional rainfall analysis is required in order to understand runoff variability and change at a basin scale it is important to notice that in this study ct is estimated using a statistical approach i e rainfall runoff correlations and for a better understanding of the influence of the geomorphological and climatic features on ct physical based methods would be required fig 10 and table 2 summarize regional p and e at annual and seasonal time scales considering the whole study period and two sub periods 1982 1990 and 2000 2017 as well as runoff and runoff coefficient at porto velho station these sub periods are chosen because temporal shifts in p r e and rc are detected during the 1990s table 2 over the northern part of the basin north of 14 s p and the frequency of wet days p 10 mm day significantly increase particularly during the wet season while e remains constant at annual scale over the southern part of the basin south of 14 s dry conditions are intensified characterized by an increase in the frequency of dry days p 1 mm day and a diminution in the mean annual p after 1991 p 0 05 in addition a shift is detected in p time series during december february and march may over the southern part of the basin in 1991 and 1992 respectively p 0 05 with drier conditions afterward which contributes to explain a shift detected in r during the low water season in 1993 p 0 01 e also diminishes significantly over the southern part of the basin at annual scale p 0 01 and a shift is detected in 1995 with lower values after this date during the 21st century annual p in the south is even lower than e in the northern part of the basin fig 10c drier conditions in the southern madeira basin could affect negatively vegetation conditions and agriculture activities and therefore the economy of the driving santa cruz region in bolivia the regional changes documented in this study have modified the hydrological annual cycle of the upper madeira basin during the last two decades fig 10d during the recent period lower rainfall runoff are observed from march to november may to february and no change is observed during the wet period except for a rainfall runoff increase in february march as a consequence rc significantly decreases during the dry season from 0 60 to 0 45 in average but no significant changes are observed during the wet season around 0 40 fig 10 e the contrasting evolution of rainfall between the north increase and south decrease has a significant impact on the rc evolution of the upper madeira basin during the 1982 2017 period in addition our results suggest changes in the atmosphere and land surface interactions over the southern part of the madeira basin since the beginning of the 1990 p diminution in the southern madeira basin is in accord with the lengthening of the dry season reported in previous studies in southern amazonia which has been related to an increase of atmospheric subsidence e g yoon and zeng 2010 agudelo et al 2018 espinoza et al 2019 e diminution in the southern madeira is probably associated with a diminution in rainfall over this region and or a reduction of the tropical forest however explanations for the decrease in e over this region need to be addressed

8414,study region upper madeira basin 975 500 km2 in southern amazonia which is suffering a biophysical transition involving deforestation and changes in rainfall regime study focus the evolution of the runoff coefficient rc runoff rainfall is examined as an indicator of the environmental changes 1982 2017 new hydrological insights for the region at an annual scale the rc at porto velho station declines while neither the basin averaged rainfall nor the runoff change during the low water period rc and runoff diminish while no changes are observed in rainfall this cannot be explained by increase of evapotranspiration since the basin averaged actual evapotranspiration decreases to explain the decrease of rc a regional analysis is undertaken while the characteristic rainfall runoff time lag ct at porto velho basin is estimated to 60 days ct is higher 65 75 days in the south and lower 50 days over the amazon andes transition regions it is found that 1 the southern basin south of 14 s best explains low level porto velho runoff 2 in the south rainfall diminishes and the frequency of dry days increases both features explain the diminution of the runoff and the rc in porto velho moreover the increasing dryness in the south compensates for the rainfall and frequency of wet days 10 mm increase north of 14 s and explains the lack of basin averaged rainfall trends of the upper madeira basin keywords runoff coefficient rainfall trends atmosphere and land surface interactions 1 introduction the upper madeira basin at porto velho extends over 975 500 km2 and is characterized by an altitude variation from 50 to 6450 masl setting the scene for a wide range of climatic geomorphological and biological features the hydrological basin at porto velho station mean annual discharge of 18 300 m3 s molina carpio et al 2017 extends in peru 11 of its surface in bolivia 73 and in brazil 16 the basin is divided into four main geomorphological units the andes the brazilian shield the amazon plain and the fitzcarrald arch formation fig 1 a the madeira river basin at porto velho station consists of four main tributaries madre de dios arriving from the peruvian andes beni and mamoré from the central bolivian andes and the guaporé river from the southeastern part of the basin brazilian shield while the andes cover around 23 of the upper madeira surface a vast floodplain the llanos de mojos extends over the lowlands between the beni mamoré and guaporé rivers guyot 1993 1996 the llanos de mojos floodplain is characterized by a mean altitude of 150 masl a slope of less than 10 cm km guyot 1993 and a floodable surface up to 150 000 km2 hamilton et al 2004 ovando et al 2016 parrens et al 2019 among others rainfall over the upper madeira basin shows a strong spatial variability with average annual values of around 1800 mm year or 5 mm day while lower values are observed in the southernmost part of the basin and over the andes fig 1b roche et al 1990 molina carpio et al 2017 the andes amazon transition region of the upper madeira basin is among the rainiest regions of the world characterized by the interactions between large scale winds circulation and the topography that determine a complex rainfall distribution e g killeen et al 2007 bookhagen and strecker 2008 espinoza et al 2009a orographic effects and exposure to easterly winds produce a strong annual rainfall gradient between the lowlands and the andes that can reach 190 mm km indeed rainfall hotspot regions with 4000 to 6000 mm year 12 16 mm day are identified at low elevations in the andean foothills 400 700 masl and in windward conditions e g espinoza et al 2015 junquas et al 2018 these very wet regions are observed particularly over the upper madre de dios beni and mamoré rivers fig 1 based on the 1968 1982 period roche 1990 used empirical equations and estimated the surface water balance at an annual scale over the upper madeira basin obtaining an average precipitation of 4 98 mm day a mean runoff at porto velho of 1 78 mm day and a mean evapotranspiration of 3 21 mm day computing the surface water balance with evapotranspiration data from different sources builes jaramillo and poveda 2018 show a state close to balance within a 10 tolerance in the madeira basin however a large negative residual is reported in the upper beni river at rurrenabaque station probably related to uncertainties in evapotranspiration products sörensson and ruscica 2018 getirana et al 2014 and underestimation of rainfall over the amazon andes transition region espinoza et al

during the mature phase of the south america monsoon system sams e g vera et al 2006 marengo et al 2012 in absence of the sams a marked dry season predominates during the austral winter june august in terms of basin average over 50 of the annual rainfall is recorded between december march e g roche 1990 ronchail and gallaire 2006 however over the rainfall hotspot region in the upper madre de dios basin exceptional rainfall also occurs during the austral dry season estimated to be around 1000 mm during june august in the san gabán meteorological station espinoza et al 2015 rainfall seasonality drives runoff and terrestrial water storage tws variability over the basin indeed molina carpio et al 2017 shows a time lag of two month between basin averaged rainfall and runoff at porto velho in addition using satellite information of tws from gravity recovery and climate experiment grace at 1 x1 of resolution a time lag of two months has been detected between rainfall and tws in the madeira basin e g xavier et al 2010 frappart et al 2013 with a seasonal range of around 4 5 mm day azarderakhsh et al 2011 recent studies have documented an intensification of the seasonal extreme hydrological events over the amazon basin e g marengo and espinoza 2016 barichivich et al 2018 espinoza et al 2019 in the madeira basin severe flooding occurred for instance in 1992 1993 1997 ronchail et al 2005 bourrel et al 2009 2007 2008 and recently exceptional rainfall and discharge values were reported in 2014 espinoza et al 2014 ovando et al 2016 which do not always coincide with those that occurred in the main stem of the amazon river molina carpio et al 2017 in terms of hydrological impacts large floods are also intensified by the superimposition of flood waves from major tributaries of the upper madeira river ovando et al 2016 several studies have reported that discharge during the low water season in the southwestern amazon including the porto velho station exhibited a significant decrease during the last four decades espinoza et al 2009b lopes et al 2016 molina carpio et al 2017 wongchuig correa et al 2017 in the southern part of the amazon basin a longer shorter dry wet season has been reported specifically since the 1980s e g salazar et al 2007 marengo et al 2011 saatchi et al 2013 fu et al 2013 arias et al 2015 debortoli et al 2015 in a recent study espinoza et al 2019 documented a significant increase of the dry day frequency ddf for the 1981 2017 period particularly over the bolivian amazon during the beginning of the wet season september november in addition future climate scenarios suggest that this region could suffer an intensification of extreme droughts boisier et al 2015 guimberteau et al 2013 polade et al 2014 in addition to the above described changes in rainfall intensity over southern amazonia recent modeling studies suggest that southern amazonia is suffering a process of biophysical transition two possible tipping points have been identified associated with temperature increase of 4 c or with deforestation exceeding 40 of the forest area surpassing these typing points large scale savannization of almost the entire southern and eastern amazon including madeira basin may take place nobre et al 2016 indeed a fragile hydrological equilibrium has been identified in southern amazon which can be broken during drought events producing persistent changes in rainforest canopy structure maeda et al 2015 total deforestation in amazonia now reaches 20 of the area and is particularly extended over the arc of deforestation in the southern and southwestern amazonia nobre et al 2016 these environmental changes could substantially impact the hydrological cycle in the southwestern amazon basin where the recycling of water from the central and eastern amazon rainforest is particularly significant zemp et al 2017 sumila et al 2017 staal et al 2018 marengo et al 2018 that is both climatic and environmental changes in southern amazonia during the last four decades have been established by the above mentioned scientific literature an important indicator of environmental changes in a basin frequently used in hydro climatic studies is the runoff coefficient rc runoff rainfall which embeds climate and or land use changes e g xu et al 2018 in this study we aim to assess the evolution of the runoff coefficient for the 1982 2017 period in the upper madeira basin annual and seasonal rc is analyzed in relation to the spatio temporal variability of the main components of the hydrological cycle rainfall and evapotranspiration the description of the hydroclimatic data and statistical methods is proposed in sections 2 and 3 respectively and the long term surface water balance for the upper madeira basin is calculated in section 4 with the aim of depicting the rc evolution over the basin the interannual evolution of both basin averaged rainfall and runoff at porto velho station is analyzed in section 5 given the geomorphological and climatic complexity of the upper madeira basin we seek to understand how the regional variability of precipitation within the basin can affect the evolution of rc section 6 to this end section 6 1 is devoted to analyze spatial variations in the characteristic rainfall runoff time lag in the basin and how this feature may affect the seasonal relationship between regional precipitation and runoff at porto velho regional trends in precipitation are analyzed in section 6 2 to understand how changes in regional precipitation can affect rc variability over the basin finally concluding remarks are presented in section 7 2 hydro climatic data 2 1 runoff time series in the upper madeira basin in this study daily runoff r discharge data is analyzed on the upper madeira river at porto velho and abunã hydrological stations covering drainage areas of 975 500 km2 and 920 100 km2 respectively fig 1a daily discharge time series were provided by the brazilian water national office agencia nacional de águas ana and quality control was checked by the sno hybam observatory for more details see molina carpio et al 2017 discharge data used in this study corresponds to the 1981 2017 period however due to missing values annual and june july discharges in 2011 at porto velho are not taken into account and 1992 1999 2001 annual values in abunã are removed from our analysis in order to compare the discharge with other hydrological variables discharge is converted to daily runoff mm day for both stations 2 2 daily rainfall datasets 2 2 1 the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps the chirps daily precipitation p dataset is based on global cold cloud duration as a primary source for calculating precipitation at a global scale then these estimations are calibrated with the precipitation estimated from the trmm 3b42 v7 product and rainfall data from the global rain gauges network finally a high spatial resolution rainfall dataset is provided at 0 05 0 05 of horizontal resolution funk et al 2015 in this study the original resolution of chirps is used for the 1981 2017 period this information is

hop data is spatially interpolated to a 1 1 horizontal resolution for more details about the ability of the interpolated hop data to reproduce hydrological variability in the amazon river see guimberteau et al 2012 and guimberteau et al 2013 satellite based precipitation products like chirps have been validated in the amazon basin with the hop data set at interannual and intraseasonal time scales and also for the daily rainfall extremes by wongchuig correa et al 2017 paccini et al 2017 espinoza et al 2019 among others daily interpolated hop data are freely available in netcdf format on

gleam global land evaporation amsterdam model estimates the potential evapotranspiration through the priestly and taylor equation and uses a set of algorithms that calculates the different components of e separately transpiration interception bare soil open water evaporation and sublimation using meteorological and vegetation data as input the precipitation input to gleamv3 2a is mswep v1 0 beck et al 2017 which is a multisource merged product based on in situ remote sensed and reanalysis data four types of land covers are possible in gleamv3 2a bare soil low vegetation tall vegetation and open water the vegetation cover is produced using the modis product mod44b and is therefore static however the variations in vegetation status is considered in the stress factor used to convert

reanalysis gldas noah rodell et al 2004 products assimilated into the gleam multi layer soil model the upper madeira basin belongs to the southern amazon region where the uncertainty of gridded e estimates from different sources such as remote sensing data and land reanalysis is high sörensson and ruscica 2018 in part because of lack of basic understanding of the processes governing e in this region christoffersen et al 2014 getirana et al 2014 sun et al 2019 however since we study a closed basin we are able to choose the e dataset that best closes the annual water budget comparing rainfall to addition of runoff and e for the period 1982 2017 not shown 2 4 terrestrial water storage from the grace mission the equivalent water thickness estimated by the grace data is used as proxy of the tws in the upper madeira basin the grace consists of twin satellites that measure changes in the earth s gravity field due to displacement of water air or land masses many studies have shown the capacity of grace to depict continental water storage variations at large spatial scales tapley et al 2004 ramillien et al 2008 as well as for validation purposes into hydrological models getirana et al 2011 paiva et al 2013 siqueira et al 2018 it is important to note that the equivalent water thickness values are not absolute values of water storage in fact these are anomalies relative to the 2004 2009 time mean baseline swenson and wahr 2006 in this study we use the rl05 level 3 version of monthly time variable gravity data with spherical harmonic coefficients up to one degree which has a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 with a monthly time step we use three 3 products of equivalent water thickness all based on the grace gravimeter raw data but developed by different research centres and laboratories the jet propulsion laboratory jpl the university of texas center for space research csr and the geoforschungszentrum gfz potsdam the rl05 data used in this work are 159 month csr jpl and gfz data from april 2002 to january 2017 the data are available at https podaac jpl nasa gov dataset tellus land nc rl05 in this study we use the term tws as the mean of equivalent water thickness from the three products as recommended by sakumura et al 2014 spatially averaged over the upper madeira basin at porto velho station thus changes in tws represent the basin average change in water storage over the basin on a monthly time scale for more details about the grace data and their applications in the amazon basin see papa et al 2008 chen et al 2010 xavier et al 2010 frappart et al 2012 2013 among others 2 5 topography data from digital elevation model dem in this study we use the freely available 90 m dem from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm v4 1 farr et al 2007 available at http srtm csi cgiar org srtmdata this information has been used to determine landscape morphology the main fluvial network the longitudinal slopes of the main rivers and the distance of each point of the river to the porto velho station a summary of the dataset used to assess the regional hydro climatic changes in the southern amazon basin is presented in table s1 3 statistical methods linear correlation is conducted in order to analyze the relationship between rainfall and runoff for this purpose the parametric pearson coefficient r is computed using significance at least at p 0 05 the seasonal variation coefficient svc of rainfall defined as the ratio of the standard deviation of monthly values to the mean of monthly values 1982 2017 was also calculated for each of the grid points defined by chirps high low values of svc represent strong weak rainfall seasonality i e high low differences between dry and wet seasons espinoza et al 2009a the characteristic rainfall runoff time lag over the basin is an indicator of the mean travel time of the streamflow wave through the catchment this characteristic time lag ct is defined as the time lag of runoff in days necessary to obtain the maximum coefficient of correlation between rainfall and runoff ct is obtained maximizing r in r pi ri ct where r is the pearson coefficient of correlation between p and r pi is rainfall on the day i and ri ct is the runoff on the day i considering a lag of ct days in addition the runoff coefficient rc r p is defined as the ratio between runoff observed in a hydrological station in this study porto velho or abunã and the spatially averaged rainfall over the basin rc is analyzed at annual and seasonal time scales finally in order to compute the interannual evolution of the hydro climatic variables trends and break points are analyzed in the september to august november to october annual averages of p r to identify trends in the hydroclimatic time series we use rank based non parametric kendall test τ kendall 1975 breaks and changes in the series are evaluated using the pettitt method pettitt 1979 a non parametric test based on changes in the average and the range of the time series subdivided into sub series these methods have been applied widely in hydroclimatologic studies and are considered among of the most complete tests for time series

with mean rainfall values higher than 6 mm day over the 1982 2017 period blue line in fig 2 fig 1b displays the mean annual rainfall values while the strength of the seasonal cycle can be described with the seasonal coefficient of variability scv displayed in fig 1c maximum daily rainfall occurs during december through february especially during january and february over the upper part of the madre de dios beni and mamoré basins characterized by the presence of rainfall hotspot regions where more than 16 mm day are reported fig 1e dry conditions are clearly identified during june august season around 1 mm day at a basin average scale fig 2 and table 1 during this season rainfall is near to zero in the andean part of the basin higher than 3000 masl around 2 mm day in the lowlands and around 1 mm day in the upper guaporé basin fig 1g in the upper madre de dios basin however rainfall can reach 9 mm day in the peruvian hotspot as reported in previous studies see introduction scv is high over the bolivian andean region scv 0 9 and over the lower guaporé and mamoré rivers scv 0 7 low scv values are observed over the amazon andes transition region scv 0 6 probably related to the presence of the intense rainfall over the hotspot regions noticeable during all the seasons fig 1d g at an annual scale the mean rainfall value over the upper madeira basin computed for the 1982 2017 period is 4 27 mm day table 1 associated with the above described rainfall regime runoff annual cycle in porto velho shows maximum minimum values between march april september october approximately two months after the respective maximum and minimum rainfall values black line in fig 2 according to table 1 runoff values vary from 0 52 mm day in august october to 3 09 mm day in february april and the mean annual value is estimated in 1 71 mm day based on these values the mean annual runoff coefficient rc estimated in the upper madeira basin for the 1982 2017 period is 0 40 table 1 at the seasonal scale rc varies from 0 39 and 0 40 in the transitional and wet season respectively to 0 53 in the dry season however annual rc is closer to rc during the wet season probably related to the weight of this season in the annual water balance the same analysis is carried out for mean annual rainfall and runoff at abunã station upstream of porto velho station fig 1a where rc is estimated to 0 38 at the scale of the upper madeira basin at porto velho these results are slightly higher than those provided for the 1968 1982 period by roche 1990 where a rc of 0 35 is estimated with mean rainfall and runoff values of 4 98 mm day and 1 78 mm day respectively both rainfall and runoff are higher in roche et al 1990 particularly the former which could be partially explained by the differences in the analyzed period and the use of different rainfall data sets actual evapotranspiration estimated by gleam shows lower seasonality than rainfall and runoff red line in fig 2 with maximum minimum values during december march june august corresponding to 3 9 mm day and 2 0 mm day respectively the seasonal cycle coincides well with the estimation of sun et al 2019 who used a water budget approach for the whole madeira basin in particular a distinctive characteristic present in both sun et al 2019 and gleama data is that the annual cycle has its minimum value in june which is a dry month this is a feature that has been observed in recent studies and can probably be explained by plant phenology e g wu et al 2016 commonly not present in land surface model based e estimates e g sörensson and ruscica 2018 the mean actual evapotranspiration for the 1982 2017 period estimated over the upper madeira basin is 2 90 mm day table 1 lower annual values are observed over the andean region 1 5 mm day and in the southernmost madeira basin 2 mm day in contrast higher e estimations are observed over the amazon andes transition region and in the northern part of the basin where e is around 4 mm day not shown this spatial pattern of e is coherent with previous studies that used several e data sources e g paca et al 2019 based on these estimations the surface water budget in the upper madeira basin computed as p r e using the long term mean values of precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration respectively is 0 34 mm day equivalent to 8 of the mean annual rainfall which is close to balance within tolerance 10 according to previous studies e g builes jaramillo and poveda 2017 uncertainties in evapotranspiration are a possible source of this imbalance however recent studies have documented a rainfall underestimation in the interpolated and satellite based rainfall estimations particularly in the amazon andes transition region such as the upper beni and the madre de dios river basins builes jaramillo and poveda 2018 espinoza et al 2015 the monthly surface water budget monthly p e r and the monthly changes in terrestrial water storage tws from the grace mission grey bars and dotted blue line in fig 2 respectively are used as indicators of the state of the surface water soil moisture and groundwater in the upper madeira basin during the hydrological year both data sources show positive negative values from october march april september which suggest that the soil is recharged with water during the august february season while during march to june the water storage is depleted it is important to note that tws shows a higher seasonality comparing to the monthly surface water budget which is partially explained by the shorter tws period 2002 2017 where several extreme floods e g 2014 2015 and droughts e g 2005 2010 2016 have been reported in the upper madeira basin indeed a better match between the monthly surface water budget and tws is obtained when values for the common 2002 2017 period are computed not shown in particular the monthly surface water budget for the 2002 2017 period shows higher values during the december february wet season reaching 2 7 mm day in february instead of 2 0 mm day and 2 3 mm day in december instead of 1 9 mm day 5 interannual evolution of the runoff rainfall relationship as described above fig 2 shows a lag of around two months between runoff and rainfall annual cycles in order to estimate the characteristic rainfall runoff time lag ct at a basin scale over the upper madeira we compute a lagged correlation between daily rainfall and runoff fig 3 a ct is computed using both chirps and hop spatially averaged daily rainfall products see section 3 the maximum coefficient of correlation between daily rainfall and runoff is obtained using 60 days lag for both products thus fig 3a confirms that the mean ct for the upper madeira basin is around two months in both cases using chirps and hop the evolution of r values shows similar shapes with a strong increase in the first 10 days of runoff lag from 0 25 to 0 40 fig 3a based on the 60 days of ct and on the onset of the wet season in september that defines the beginning of the hydrological year fig 2 the september to august november to october annual averages of p r is analyzed fig 3b in addition when a seasonal analysis is conducted september to november november to january is used to define the onset of the sams season and june to august august to october is used to define the dry season for rainfall runoff the coefficient of correlation r p r between the mean annual runoff and rainfall is 0 71 fig 3b and table 1 which varies from 0 45 during the dry season to 0 73 during the onset of the sams table 1 these correlations are significant at p 0 001 at annual time scale no significant trend is detected in either rainfall or runoff over the upper madeira however a significant diminution of evapotranspiration τ e is identified p 0 001 with a break point in 1995 p 0 05 and lower values afterwards table 1 nevertheless in terms of absolute values the detected e diminution plays a minor role in the basin water balance indeed the 1982 2017 standard deviation of e is lower 0 07 mm day than the standard deviations of rainfall 0 38 mm day and runoff 0 31 mm day and e diminishes from 2 93 mm day during the 1980s to 2 88 mm day during the 21st century which corresponds to 2 of mean annual p in order to evaluate changes in the runoff rainfall relationship over the upper madeira basin the interannual evolution of rc is estimated using chirps and hop rainfall data sets averaged over the porto velho and abunã basins and runoff estimated at the same two stations figs 4 a and 4b respectively in all the cases a significant diminution of rc is detected for the 1982 2017 period p 0 05 which cannot be directly explained by the significant diminution of actual evapotranspiration indeed diminution trend in rc is usually associated with an increase of water losses in the annual budget such as increases of evapotranspiration considering a seasonal analysis of rc a significant diminution p 0 05 is only observed during the dry season fig 4c and significant diminution of evapotranspiration is only observed during december february season table 1 break points are detected in rc at annual time scale and during the dry season in 1998 and 1997 respectively p 0 05 and lower values are observed afterwards on the other hand evapotranspiration shows break points in 1997 p 0 01 and 1995 p 0 05 during the december february and march may seasons respectively table 1 also shows that the interannual variability of rc is particularly modulated by the interannual variability of runoff but not by rainfall interannual variability since the coefficient of correlation between runoff and rc r r rc is significant at p 0 01 regardless of the season while no significant correlation is observed between the interannual variability of rainfall and rc r p rc in coherence with these results and in accordance with previous studies espinoza et al 2009b molina carpio et al 2017a a significant runoff diminution is observed during the low water season august to october and november to january p 0 05 fig 4d and a break point is identified in 1993 in august to october runoff p 0 01 with lower values afterwards table 1 these results suggest a change in the runoff rainfall relationship in the upper madeira basin characterized by a runoff diminution during the low water season that is not observed in the basin averaged rainfall producing a significant diminution of the rc nevertheless evapotranspiration shows a significant diminution particularly during the december to february wet season which seems contradictory with the rc diminution in the upper madeira these results suggest that changes in land surface processes or changes in regional rainfall intensity may impact the observed rc evolution in the following section the regional influence of rainfall on runoff variability at porto velho is analyzed in order to better understand the observed changes in the rainfall runoff relationship 6 regional rainfall influence on runoff at porto velho basin 6 1 regional change in the characteristic rainfall runoff time lag ct and seasonal rainfall runoff relationship considering the large extension of the upper madeira basin 975 500 km2 and the geomorphological and climatic diversity that characterize the basin it is particularly important to analyze the regional rainfall influence on runoff variability computing the regional distribution of the ct over the basin fig 5 a provides an initial overview in this case ct is computed using the significant coefficient of correlation between each the daily rainfall at grid point and the lagged daily runoff at porto velho see section 3 while the mean ct over the basin is estimated to 60 days fig 3a ct over the southern part of the basin particularly south of 14 s is higher than the mean ct reaching 65 75 days fig 5a in particular high ct values are observed over the middle and upper mamoré and guaporé basins upstream of the llanos de mojos floodplain indeed a rapid transition in ct is identified above the 150 masl grey line in fig 5a which correspond to the mean elevation of the llanos de mojos floodplain guyot 1993 thus fig 5a suggests that the llanos de mojos plays a relevant role in modulating the spatial distribution of ct over the upper madeira basin fig 5a also displays low ct values over the amazon andes transition region of the madre de dios and beni rivers these regions are characterized by extreme rainfall values and the presence of steep slopes fig 1 which can explain lower ct values of 50 55 days in order to clarify the spatial distribution of ct over the madeira basin figs 5b and 5c show the variations of geomorphological parameters altitude and slope in relation to ct values along the first 1600 km of the river upstream of porto velho station following the guaporé and beni tributaries for this distances vs ct pairs are computed from fig 5a each 50 km then for each ct at one day of resolution we calculate the mean distance for all the pairs black circles in fig 5b and 5c regarding the guaporé river the mean slope becomes near zero between 400 km and 1050 km from porto velho at around 150 masl which corresponds to the llanos de mojos floodplain downstream of the floodplain between zero and 400 km from porto velho ct is around 55 days but this value increases over the floodplain region to 65 days finally high ct values 65 75 days are observed upstream of the floodplain fig 5b the extension of the floodplain along the beni river is smaller comparing to guaporé river minimal slope is identified between 250 km to 600 km from porto velho and ct over this region is around 60 days fig 5c about 1100 km from porto velho the slope of the beni river increases and the mean river altitude change from 200 masl to 300 masl this region corresponds to the beginning of the rainfall hotspot region and lower ct values are found 45 55 days the influence of the floodplain and the extreme rainfall zones hotspot are also remarkable in the mamoré and madre de dios rivers supplementary figure s1 these results provide new information regarding the spatial distribution of ct over the upper madeira basin and suggest a differentiated regional influence of rainfall on runoff at porto velho indeed rainfall over the hotspot regions show a rapid influence on runoff ct around 45 55 days and rainfall over the southern part of the basin particularly south of the 14 s upstream of the llanos de mojos floodplain shows a delayed influence on runoff ct around 75 days according to the above described results we analyze the annual and seasonal correlation between rainfall in each grid point and runoff at porto velho fig 6 at annual scale rainfall over the middle madre de dios beni and mamoré basins which correspond to the rainiest regions of the basins show a stronger influence on runoff variability fig 6a however rainfall over the southern part of the basin shows low or no significant correlation with runoff at porto velho this behavior is mostly related to the wet season pattern fig 6c with higher correlation values over the middle beni basin during march to may fig 6d rainfall over the lowland is highly correlated to may to july runoff significant values also appear over the southeastern part of the basin mamoré and guaporé basins and no significant correlation is observed over the andean region fig 6d during the dry season and the beginning of the hydrological year rainfall over the southern part of the basin is significantly correlated to runoff particularly over the upper beni mamoré and guaporé basins and in the upper madre de dios during september november season fig 6e and 6b these results show that runoff during the high water period february to april is more dependent on rainfall over the northwestern part of the basin particularly over beni and madre de dios basins and during the low water season august to october runoff is more related to rainfall over the southern part of the basin however the southern part of the basin shows higher ct values 75 days fig 5a suggesting a slow influence of rainfall over this region on runoff at porto velho probably associated with the role of the llanos de mojos floodplain fig 5a and 5b therefore we compute the correlation between spatialized rainfall during a larger season from april to august and runoff during the low water period august to october at porto velho fig 6f the results confirm that rainfall over the southern part of the basin upstream of the llanos de mojos floodplain is significantly correlated to runoff at porto velho during the low water period in addition during the dry season june to august rainfall in the south of 14 s represent 44 of the mean rainfall over the upper madeira basin these results suggest that not only the evolution of the basin areal mean rainfall is important to understand runoff evolution at porto velho but that the analysis on a sub basin scale is also necessary 6 2 changes in regional rainfall patterns in a recent study espinoza et al 2019 show an increase of the dry day frequency ddf defined as the number of days with rainfall 1 mm over the southern amazon basin particularly during the transitional september november season in addition the authors documented a diminution in the frequency of wet days wdf defined as the number of days with rainfall 10 mm during this season in fig 7 we provide a more detailed analysis of the seasonal 1981 2017 evolution of the ddf and wdf over the upper madeira basin using chirps rainfall data over the southern part of the basin particularly south of 14 s a significant diminution of wdf and an increase of ddf are observed suggesting drier conditions over this region this pattern is observed in all the seasons with some specificities for instance diminution of wdf is remarkable along the year with more intensity during september to november and march to may fig 7a and 7e and the increase of ddf is more intense during september to november and december to february over the southern upper madeira basin fig 7b d and f these changes do not occur over the andean beni river basin at rurrenabaque station where no decreasing runoff trends were observed molina carpio et al 2017 moreover during the wet december to february season wdf significantly increase over the northern part of the basin particularly to the north of 14 s fig 7c these results confirm a contrasted evolution of rainfall intensity in the upper madeira basin characterized by increasing wdf in the north particularly during the wet season and decreasing wdf and increasing ddf in the south during the entire hydrological year the regional evolution of total rainfall at annual and seasonal time scales is provided in figs 8 and 9 considering two regions the southern part of the basin south of the 14 s in red and the northern part north of the 14 s in blue these two regions are chosen due to the observed changes in rainfall intensity wdf and ddf fig 7 and based on the differences of the regional ct observed in fig 5a and the seasonal rainfall influence on the runoff at porto velho section 6 1 fig 6 at the annual scale september august rainfall in the northern part of the basin shows a significant increase p 0 05 and no break points are detected table 2 over the southern part of the basin no trend is observed in annual rainfall however rainfall in the south shows a shift in 1991 p 0 05 with lower values after this date table 2 as a consequence the annual difference between rainfall over the northern and southern part of the basin blue bars in fig 8 significantly increase p 0 01 and a shift is detected in 1991 p 0 01 with larger differences after this date table 2 at the annual scale actual evapotranspiration diminishes in the southern part of the basin table 2 p 0 01 and a shift is detected in 1995 p 0 01 four years after the shift observed in rainfall in the south however over the northern part of the basin no evapotranspiration trend or shift is detected at the seasonal scale fig 9 diminution in rainfall over the southern basin is remarkable during september november fig 9a where a negative rainfall trend in the south is detected p 0 1 and a shift is observed in 1991 1992 during december february march may significant at p 0 1 p 0 05 dryer conditions are observed after this date fig 9b and d table 2 these results suggest that runoff diminution observed in porto velho during the low water season is associated with drier condition over the southern part of the basin in particular both the low water time series of runoff and rainfall in the south are characterized by shifts at the beginning of the 1990s tables 1 and 2 with lower values afterwards indeed the shifts detected in low water runoff in 1993 can be associated with the shift detected in rainfall over the southern part of the basin in 1991 92 as documented in section 6 1 and fig 6 rainfall over the southern part of the basin plays a key role to modulate runoff variability at porto velho during the low water period analyzing the coefficient of correlation between rainfall in the northern and southern part of the basin vs runoff at porto velho table 2 shows that seasonal rainfall over both regions are significantly correlated with seasonal runoff except for runoff during the low water season during this season runoff is only significantly correlated to rainfall in the south which is in accordance with fig 6f regarding rainfall in the northern part of the basin a positive trend is detected in december february p 0 1 and a break point is observed in 2002 p 0 05 increase in northern basin december to february rainfall is coherent with the wdf intensification in this region fig 7c which translate in a rainfall increase in the north at the annual scale fig 8 fig 9 and table 2 also document a significant increase of the regional rainfall differences at annual and seasonal scales over the 1983 2017 period difference increase is significant at p 0 01 except for the september to november season that is significant at p 0 05 fig 9 table 2 evapotranspiration in the south significantly diminishes during december to february and march to may p 0 01 and p 0 05 respectively and shifts are observed in 1997 and 1995 respectively with lower values after these dates table 2 that is a few years later than the shift of rainfall in the south 1991 1992 finally evapotranspiration in the north shows a diminution trend during december to february p 0 01 a downward shift in 2007 p 0 05 and an increasing trend during june to august p 0 01 table 2 these results provide new information regarding the spatial rainfall evolution over the upper madeira basin which is a key issue to clarify the reason of the observed changes in the hydrological regime at a basin scale indeed the rc diminution reported in section 5 fig 4a is particularly associated with the runoff diminution during the low water season fig 4d and table 1 and with the diminution in rainfall over the southern part of the basin particularly after 1991 92 however during the wet season total rainfall and wdf significantly increase over the northern part of the basin an increase that also is perceptible at the annual scale the increase in precipitation in the north and the decrease in the south are compensated at the basin scale where no trend is detected in annual rainfall and runoff however this contrasted rainfall evolution has significantly impacted the rainfall seasonality over the basin and the evolution of rc in addition associated with rainfall diminution and ddf increase in the southern part of the basin a significant diminution in evapotranspiration has been detected over this region while annual rainfall in the south shifted in 1991 and drier conditions are observed after this date annual evapotranspiration in the south shifted in 1995 and lower values are observed after this date diminution in actual evapotranspiration in the southern madeira can be related to a diminution in rainfall over this region and or a reduction of the tropical forest as documented in previous studies see introduction 7 conclusions and final comments during the last four decades scientific literature has documented climatic and environmental changes in southern amazonia including the upper madeira basin 975 500 km2 in this study we document that the runoff coefficient rc runoff rainfall in the upper madeira basin an indicator of environmental changes over the basin decreases during the 1982 2017 period and in particular during the dry season rc diminution is associated with a significant runoff diminution p 0 05 during the low water season august to october however in terms of basin averaged rainfall no trend is detected therefore an analysis at the basin scale is not satisfactory to explain the changes observed in rc and is a first argument for developing an analysis at the sub regional level initially we provide a comprehensive analysis of the surface water budget over the basin using i daily runoff r at porto velho and abunã stations ii daily rainfall p iii evapotranspiration e and iv terrestrial water storage tws the surface water balance for the 1982 2017 period shows an imbalance of 0 34 mm day equivalent to 8 of the mean annual p which is acceptable according to previous studies over the amazon basin the mean characteristic rainfall runoff time lag ct into the basin which is an indicator of the mean travel time of the streamflow wave through the catchment is estimated to 60 days considering the basin averaged p and r in porto velho however ct is higher 65 75 days in the southern part of the basin upstream of the llanos de mojos floodplain and lower 50 days over the amazon andes transition regions characterized by extreme rainfall values and high slopes these results confirm that a regional rainfall analysis is required in order to understand runoff variability and change at a basin scale it is important to notice that in this study ct is estimated using a statistical approach i e rainfall runoff correlations and for a better understanding of the influence of the geomorphological and climatic features on ct physical based methods would be required fig 10 and table 2 summarize regional p and e at annual and seasonal time scales considering the whole study period and two sub periods 1982 1990 and 2000 2017 as well as runoff and runoff coefficient at porto velho station these sub periods are chosen because temporal shifts in p r e and rc are detected during the 1990s table 2 over the northern part of the basin north of 14 s p and the frequency of wet days p 10 mm day significantly increase particularly during the wet season while e remains constant at annual scale over the southern part of the basin south of 14 s dry conditions are intensified characterized by an increase in the frequency of dry days p 1 mm day and a diminution in the mean annual p after 1991 p 0 05 in addition a shift is detected in p time series during december february and march may over the southern part of the basin in 1991 and 1992 respectively p 0 05 with drier conditions afterward which contributes to explain a shift detected in r during the low water season in 1993 p 0 01 e also diminishes significantly over the southern part of the basin at annual scale p 0 01 and a shift is detected in 1995 with lower values after this date during the 21st century annual p in the south is even lower than e in the northern part of the basin fig 10c drier conditions in the southern madeira basin could affect negatively vegetation conditions and agriculture activities and therefore the economy of the driving santa cruz region in bolivia the regional changes documented in this study have modified the hydrological annual cycle of the upper madeira basin during the last two decades fig 10d during the recent period lower rainfall runoff are observed from march to november may to february and no change is observed during the wet period except for a rainfall runoff increase in february march as a consequence rc significantly decreases during the dry season from 0 60 to 0 45 in average but no significant changes are observed during the wet season around 0 40 fig 10 e the contrasting evolution of rainfall between the north increase and south decrease has a significant impact on the rc evolution of the upper madeira basin during the 1982 2017 period in addition our results suggest changes in the atmosphere and land surface interactions over the southern part of the madeira basin since the beginning of the 1990 p diminution in the southern madeira basin is in accord with the lengthening of the dry season reported in previous studies in southern amazonia which has been related to an increase of atmospheric subsidence e g yoon and zeng 2010 agudelo et al 2018 espinoza et al 2019 e diminution in the southern madeira is probably associated with a diminution in rainfall over this region and or a reduction of the tropical forest however explanations for the decrease in e over this region need to be addressed
