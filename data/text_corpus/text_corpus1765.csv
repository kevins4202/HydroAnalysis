8825,the projected increase of industrial water demands raises the need to assess the environmental sustainability of industrial water use assessment methods need to use sustainable systems indicators ssis which relate resource use to the carrying capacity of the local environment ssis for water use evaluate whether water use exceeds the natural water renewal quantity and whether emissions remain within the assimilation capacity of ecosystems quality we systematically reviewed the scientific literature to show which methods are used to assess industrial water use and of these which methods incorporate ssis in total 82 assessment methods were identified in 340 papers the methods were assigned to five categories key performance indicators composite indices environmental accounting material and energy flow analysis and life cycle analysis in 26 of the reviewed papers the assessment methods used ssis the number of papers incorporating ssis is growing at a slower rate than the overall number of papers in the area of sustainability assessments of industrial water use considering the expected growth in industrial water use this poses a risk to sustainable water use the best performing category in terms of incorporating ssis is material and energy flow analysis 42 of papers papers assessing several industrial sectors in the same study incorporate ssis more frequently 68 than research focused on a single industry or process 20 we discuss examples from the reviewed papers which successfully incorporate ssis in order to 1 identify the elements needed to create ssis for industrial water use 2 aid researchers and practitioners in selecting methods which incorporate ssis and 3 provide a starting point for future methodological development incorporating ssis graphical abstract image 1 keywords industrial water use environmental assessment methods environmental sustainability system sustainability 1 introduction both human societies and natural ecosystems depend on the availability of adequate water resources water is not only needed to satisfy basic human needs but is also crucial for sustainable economic development 1 on a global scale the rate at which water resources are naturally replenished is more than enough to meet the demand of humanity 2 however water resources and water demand are heterogeneously distributed around the globe this results in some areas having a water surplus while other areas have a water deficit on a local scale anthropogenic water use often exceeds the watersheds natural recharge rate resulting in water scarcity 3 global water demand is projected to increase from 3500 km3 year 1 in 2000 to around 5500 km3 year 1 in 2050 4 in many places around the world the response to the increasing water demand is to increase the extraction of non renewable water i e water not replenished through the hydrological cycle this leads to the overdraft of aquifers 5 depletion of surface reservoirs and ecosystem water shortages overdrafting the water resources needed to maintain the local ecosystems leads to the degradation of those ecosystems and ecosystem services on which societies depend 6 7 the aral sea disaster is one example of how local over extraction leads to ecosystem degradation the impact of this over extraction was the disappearance of fish populations desertification and decreased air quality which led to severe ecological and human welfare damage 8 the negative effects of water extraction can be avoided by balancing human water demand with renewable water availability for both the global and the local scale industry is one of the main users of water and their water use is expected to increase 4 water demand is expected to increase with 400 by 2050 4 for the manufacturing industry this increased industrial demand can have severe consequences on the local environment and ecosystems this paper focuses specifically on the environmental sustainability of industrial water use in terms of quantity and quality industrial water use needs to be based on sustainable water extraction rates that are adequately determined and evaluated several assessment methods have been developed to evaluate the sustainability of industrial water resource use 9 most of these assessment methods have been effective at increasing resource use efficiency 10 however increasing resource use efficiency alone is not enough to reach a sustainable system 10 to create a sustainable water system industries need assessment methods which can quantify their water use in relation to renewable water availability and the ability of ecosystems to purify pollutants across all relevant spatiotemporal scales the relationship between sustainability industrial or any other resource use and assessment methods is captured by the concept of sustainable systems indicators ssis introduced by ref 11 assessment methods using ssis link resource use to the carrying capacity of ecosystems providing the resources an evaluation of assessment methods based on the use of ssis has not yet been performed within the area of industrial water use with this in mind a review of the assessment methods themselves instead of their results is needed establishing which assessment methods effectively incorporate ssis for water use is needed to move past efficiency gains and towards sustainable industrial water use the interrelations between water use and energy use the water energy nexus are not addressed directly in this paper research objective the objective of this research is to gain insight into the effectiveness of commonly used assessment methods to evaluate the environmental sustainability of industrial water use this paper categorizes and qualitatively assesses the methods used to evaluate industrial water use based on data gathered through a systematic literature review the results of the review allow for more thorough selection of assessment methods and for better interpretation of assessment results additionally this review serves as a starting point for future assessment methodology development such a review is needed to adequately assess water resource use considering the natural variability in supply and the expected increases in industrial water demand the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methodology used for the review section 3 presents the background theory on assessment methodologies section 4 presents and discusses the extent to which ssis are incorporated in assessment methods and within industrial sectors and section 5 summarizes and concludes our findings 2 methodology 2 1 systematic review previous review papers on sustainability assessments of industrial systems i e 9 10 and 12 were used for a meta review to define the search strategy for this research table 1 and to guide the development of the evaluation framework papers found through the search strategy were screened according to four criteria 1 industry only articles focusing on industrial processes were included the industrial sectors included were energy production manufacturing mining petro chemical and waste processing the petro chemical industry is often considered part of the manufacturing industry 13 we make a distinction between the petro chemical and other manufacturing industry due to large quantities of water used in the petrochemical industry 14 by making this distinction the difference in assessment practices for these sectors can become apparent a mixed sector was created for papers that evaluated water use in multiple sectors industrial processes that focused on the refinement of agricultural products e g cheese and wine production fall under manufacturing category since raw materials are converted into a final product the production of agricultural products livestock or aquaculture were considered out of scope 2 environmental sustainability papers incorporating the environmental aspect of sustainability and more specifically the sustainability of water use quantity quality were included assessments solely addressing social or economic sustainability of industrial activities were excluded 3 assessment methodology the definition of a sustainability assessment method used by ref 9 is a method which can provide quantitative information that can potentially help industries to assess their environmental sustainability this definition was used to include papers articles elaborating on a product technology or industrial system that did not elaborate on the assessment method used to evaluate the product technology or industrial system were excluded 4 case studies the aim of this research is to identify the methods used to evaluate industrial water use in real cases papers elaborating on a specific industry or method to evaluate an industrial sector were included papers evaluating water resource use of a country or region were excluded 2 2 assessment framework the purpose of the assessment framework used in this research is to determine which assessment methods are suitable to evaluate the environmental sustainability of industrial water use the evaluation framework for this research is based on the lowell center for sustainable production lcsp indicator framework as developed by ref 11 the lcsp framework is used because it provides a structured way to evaluate assessment methods which focus specifically on environmental sustainability in this research the lcsp framework is used to determine the extent to which the indicators used in different assessment methods include threshold values based on the renewable availability of water resources the lcsp framework ranks indicators on 5 levels where indicators that reach level 5 can be considered sustainable systems indicators 11 the different levels are intended to be evolutionary meaning indicators that reach levels 1 through 4 are the building blocks to create level 5 indicators level 1 and 2 indicators limit assessment to processes and water resource use within the company facility boundaries level 3 and 4 indicators expand the boundary of the assessment to the effects of the company facility on the outside environment level 5 indicators place company facility resource use and emissions in relation with sustainable renewal rates of water resources and the assimilation capacity of the environment the lcsp framework has previously been used to evaluate sustainability indicators used in the petrochemical 15 and pharmaceutical industries 16 the framework has not yet been used to compare assessment methods specifically for industrial water use in this research the original criteria of the lcsp framework are used and operationalized to assess how ssis are incorporated in the assessment methods for water use in industry the different levels and associated operationalization of the lcsp framework for this research are shown in table 2 in the systematic review indicators were evaluated according to the criteria presented in table 2 irrespective of the aspect they assess such as water quality or quantity papers using several water related indicators were ranked based on the highest scoring indicator 3 theory after the brundtland report in 1987 the importance of sustainable development gained increased attention consequently methods were then needed to evaluate progress towards sustainable development 18 to date there is a multitude of assessment methods to evaluate the environmental sustainability of industrial systems 9 12 19 20 because of the plethora of methods categorization is required for further analysis 9 argue that the classification used by the oecd 21 is the most suitable since it is the closest to practice within industry and is used in this research the oecd classification consists of six categories 1 key performance indicators 2 socially responsible investment indices 3 composite indices 4 material and energy flow analysis 5 environmental accounting 6 life cycle analysis the interconnections between the proposed categories e g material and energy flow analysis and life cycle analysis 9 are relevant when determining if the combination of methodology categories results in better performance in terms of ssis the oecd categories used to group papers in this research are described in sections 3 1 3 6 3 1 key performance indicators kpis the selection and development of kpis aims to reduce the amount of data which needs to be collected and tracked to evaluate system performance key performance indicators kpis were originally used to evaluate the economic performance of organizations 9 more recently sets of kpis have been developed to evaluate the environmental sustainability of human activities careful selection of kpis is needed to make sure the complete system is evaluated 22 kpis do not always reveal the underlying reasons for system performance or show which changes are needed to improve performance 23 these shortcomings are reinforced by the fact that development and disclosure of environmental kpis is predominantly voluntary 24 while the selection of indicators is largely based on the realities values and culture of the organization using them 25 even so the implementation and monitoring of kpis is useful for tracking developments within an organization 26 3 2 composite indices ci composite indices ci are built by aggregating separate indicators kpis into a single metric according to a specified method 27 28 the apparent simplicity of ci outputs makes them appealing for policy and decision makers since large amounts of information can be condensed into more manageable and comparable values 28 the benefits of ci include ease of interpretation ability to rank alternatives facilitating communication and making performance and progress central within the policy arena 29 the main critique within ci research is the subjective nature of the weighing scales 12 30 determination of weights is generally done through participative expert inputs or non participatory methods 28 procedures such as the analytic hierarchy process 31 can be used to standardize the process of deriving priority weights but the input for such procedures still has a subjective nature the participatory method can be valuable in relation to ssis due to the possibility for local experts to give added emphasis to locally relevant issues after weight determination the individual kpis are aggregated to generate the final index the aggregating procedure can also have significant influence on the final outcome of the assessment 32 due to internal assumptions weighting and aggregating the outcome of a ci can yield different results when analyzing the same system the effects of this internal bias was shown when evaluating the overall sustainability of different countries 33 and where results were dependent on methodological choices the economic and social sustainability aspects included in many ci were not taken into account when evaluating ci papers based on the lcsp framework to evaluate ci methods according to the lcsp framework the underlying indicators specifically related to the environmental sustainability of water use were considered the weighting and aggregation steps of ci were not considered because these only affect the extent to which environmental economic and social sustainability are represented in the final index score 3 3 socially responsible investment indices sri sri are used by stakeholders and investors to benchmark the sustainability performance of organizations and corporations 21 in most cases this takes the form of a ranking list 9 over the last decades the number of corporate social responsibility indices and metrics for the assessment of corporate performance has steadily grown 34 while the underlying motives for companies to engage in corporate social responsibility can be debated 35 the development of sri does foster competition among companies to enhance their environmental performance 34 the environmental performance of companies measured through sri is frequently highlighted in sustainability reports 36 the extent to which sri reflects whether a company contributes to a sustainable future is still lacking in part because many sri do not yet relate company resource use to the carrying capacity of ecosystems 34 3 4 material and energy flow analysis mefa the underlying principle of mefa is the law of conservation of mass and energy 37 to assess the flows of materials or energy in a given system 38 39 the use of mefa to evaluate the environmental performance of human activities began in the 1970s 39 and has become an important tool for decision making in many fields 37 combination of mefa with other methodologies such as life cycle analysis is expected to increase accuracy and relevance and has been on the research agenda for years 37 mefa methods systematically quantify stocks and flows within the system and connect these to their respective sources and sinks mefa methods are frequently used in the life cycle inventory phase within life cycle analysis this approach makes it possible to relate resource utilization to the carrying capacity of the ecosystem 37 40 the above process is generally performed with either materials substances or energy as units of measurement there is a range of methodologies within mefa which can lead to differing outcomes for the same case based on the boundary conditions chosen 41 even so mefa make it possible to determine the direction of change in terms of resource utilization and material energy flows 42 3 5 environmental accounting ea environmental accounting methods convert environmental value ecosystem services to economic value in order to evaluate the costs or benefits of resource exploitation 9 conversion of environmental to economic value allows organizations to assess their environmental performance and report their progress to external stakeholders 43 the monetization of ecosystem services can make them subject to market mechanisms of exchange and sale 44 the exchange and sale of ecosystem services can be problematic when not all ecosystem services can be captured in a monetary value or there is missing knowledge on the interdependence of ecosystem services it is recognized that ea could theoretically contribute towards more sustainable practices but the current voluntary nature in contrast to economic accounting can also undermine this purpose in a world where decision maker acceptance of personal accountability is severely lacking 45 and organizations actively work to avoid accountability 46 it is hard to reconcile transparent disclosure with voluntary accountability without obligatory independent assessments the quality of ea is considered very low in comparison to traditional monetary accounting practices 47 additionally improvements tend to be overruled by business interests 48 despite the shortcomings of ea there are also arguments for the added value of this type of assessment 49 concludes that cost benefit analysis a sub methodology within ea does not tell regulators all they need to know but without it they will know far too little ea can be a powerful tool to inform decision makers about environmental sustainability and can be even more effective when used alongside other methods 50 3 6 life cycle analysis lca lca calculates the environmental impact of a product or service over its lifetime in the 1970 s lca mostly focused on the analysis of energy 51 since then lca methods have grown to cover a wide variety of environmental impacts 51 the most relevant impact categories in relation to water use are water use freshwater ecotoxicity marine ecotoxicity and freshwater eutrophication 52 between 1990 and 2000 lca entered policy and legislation as a tool for decision makers from 2000 to 2010 lca methods started to diverge in order to address some of the drawbacks of the method such as the limited system boundaries and allocation 53 currently lca methods are expanding from attributional lca alca to consequential lca clca 51 the alca focuses on the environmental impacts of specific products or services per functional unit of the product in clca the systems boundaries are increased to evaluate impacts over larger spatiotemporal scales and to investigate how resource flows and their associated environmental impacts will change as a consequence of changes in demand for the functional unit 54 the transition towards clca increases the complexity of analysis but also makes it possible to holistically assess environmental impacts 51 the strengths of lca include that it provides a comprehensive and structured investigation and assessment highlights potential environmental tradeoffs can challenge conventional wisdom advances the knowledge base and fosters communication and discourse 55 lca can also incorporate an increasing number of relevant impact categories and can be applied to a wide range of systems such as products industrial sectors or countries despite these strengths lca has limitations which hinder assessing system sustainability arguably the most prominent drawback is the difficulty for integration of results across different temporal and spatial scales 56 for some environmental impacts the location of emissions and associated effects are almost independent as is the case for ozone depletion and climate change 56 other environmental impacts can vary by orders of magnitude due to variations in local sensitivities 56 in addition to the above limitations lca is unable to account for changes of conditions outside the geographic system boundaries which can affect the system being studied 57 these issues are on the lca research agenda and have led to continuous improvements combining lca methodologies with other methods is being researched to overcome the above limitations 58 an example is the incorporation of water scarcity indicators into lca which makes it possible to relate the water use impact category to local conditions 59 the aware methodology is a recent development incorporating water scarcity on a spatial scale 60 61 4 results discussion 4 1 overall performance a total of 340 papers were analyzed table 1 and 82 assessment methods to evaluate industrial water use were identified see annex 1 for an overview of the methods identified and the lcsp level of the indicators used in these methods the sri methodology category was not encountered in any of the 340 papers evaluating the environmental sustainability of industrial water use papers matching the search criteria started appearing in 1995 and their prevalence grew up to 2018 fig 1 the large increase in kpis and ci papers in 2018 is due to a large number of papers combining methods in 2018 in 26 of the papers the assessment methods used matched ssis criteria but performance is not uniform across the oecd methodology categories fig 2 in relation to the total number of papers in each category the mefa category performs the best with regards to ssi use 42 while lca performs the worst 16 fig 2 papers using lca methods are the most prevalent 160 out of 340 and use level 4 indicators in 74 of the papers the prevalence of papers using lca methods with level 4 indicators causes overall performance to be at level 4 39 fig 2 the methods used in the majority of papers 74 are either not suitable to assess water use at the ssis level due to methodological limitations or there is a lack of ambition to reach this level of assessment the overall growth rate of papers using indicators with reach the level of ssis is lower than papers not using ssis fig 3 this is of concern because it shows that evaluating water use in relation to the carrying capacity of ecosystems using ssis is not yet assimilated within the research community on the topic of industrial water use decision making based on level 1 4 assessments can lead do degradation of ecosystems and the associated ecosystem services they provide the possibility to use ssis is closely linked to the availability of data the unavailability of accurate data across all spatial scales requires a trade off between precision and applicability 62 level 5 assessment methods ssis require extensive data on human activities as well as the carrying capacity of the local environment affected by human activities in relation to ssis data unavailability poses the following problem should researchers use ssis level 5 with insufficient data with the possibility of arriving at incorrect conclusions or use indicators with lower data requirements levels 1 4 with the knowledge that environmental sustainability cannot be fully assessed in either case ecosystems are at risk of over exploitation further research on the interactions between data availability and the choice to use methods with ssis is suggested for future research in 56 papers methods from two or three categories were combined when methods are combined there is a higher use of ssis 30 compared to papers which use a single method 25 table 3 the added value of combining methods from different categories is the largest for the lca category which increased from 16 to 33 when mefa and lca are combined with each other ssis use is the highest at 45 in sections 4 2 4 6 we discuss the performance of papers in each oecd category focusing on the methodological elements leading to the level of ssis in each section we first discuss the category in general then we provide examples of papers which use ssis and discuss why the indicators are considered ssis the example papers discussed in the following sections can serve as a starting point for future methodological development future methodological development can use the lcsp framework together with the examples provided to ensure ssis level indicators are used or argue why indicators at the ssis level are intentionally omitted 4 2 key performance indicators kpis kpis were encountered in 84 papers and of those 23 papers used ssis 28 in 19 papers where kpis were used the level of ssis was achieved without utilizing additional methods from other categories of the 16 papers where kpis were combined with methods from other categories 4 used ssis the predominant performance of papers using kpis is level 2 45 facility material use and performance indicators kpis generally focus on the performance and efficiency within the facility and therefore do not include the required environmental conditions outside the facility to assess system sustainability assessments at this level generally lead to efficiency gains instead of progress towards sustainable systems as explained by ref 10 4 2 1 examples of kpis at ssis level 63 provide a comprehensive set of indicators to assess the sustainability of industrial water use by linking water use to effects on the aquifers or water bodies from which water is taken to meet the criteria of ssis they combine performance indicators withdrawal by source m3 year 1 with concern indicators aquifers sources significantly affected by water withdrawal water risk at national level 63 this approach creates effective threshold values for the indicators to be considered ssis the techno ecological synergy tes method developed by ref 64 evaluates the demand for any ecosystem service e g water quality regulation or water provisioning service against the supply of this service on each ecological scale the tes method considers the demand site for resources to be a black box and evaluates whether flows in and out of the black box are in balance with the local environment the system is considered sustainable when the renewable supply is larger than the demand at the investigated scale the framework generates an indicator for any ecosystem service used by humans and relates the use of each service to the renewable availability over any spatial scale the tes methodology was applied to evaluate and optimize a methanol transesterification process 65 the optimization process takes the carrying capacity of local ecosystems into account and therefore accurately reflects the amount of economic activity which can be sustained for longer periods of time a modelling approach is taken by xu et al when optimizing water resource allocation in a coal chemical industrial park 66 they use the availability including the uncertainty of water resources provided by a river as a constraint to optimize water allocation by setting the sustainable availability as a constraint the resulting optimal solution is in line with the local carrying capacity of water systems aitken et al evaluate the water use of the mining industry in chile 67 by relating water use to water scarcity they calculate a water scarcity index wsi for a baseline scenario and in a scenario where environmental water requirements are included subsequently the impact of water use by mining on water scarcity are calculated by relating the water use of individual industries to overall water availability the approach meets the criteria for ssis the use of wsi has also been promoted in relation to water use within the lca community see section 4 6 4 3 composite indices ci in 14 of 41 cases 34 the indicators used in the ci category matched ssis criteria combining ci with methods from other categories occurred in 17 papers and resulted in ssis in four papers 24 ci perform better than kpis because the focus shifts from individual processes within the system to a broader evaluation of the system 4 3 1 examples of ci at ssis level zaharia et al used the global pollution index method to evaluate the environmental impacts of economic activities in general 68 and of a specific product 69 the global pollution index method relates the actual state of the environment as influenced by human activities to the ideal state of the environment this method matches the criteria for ssis although quantification of environmental states is challenging and is very data intensive the sustainable process index method was used in multiple cases i by ref 70 to evaluate industrial production in general ii by ref 71 to evaluate the sugar industry and iii by ref 72 to evaluate several industrial case studies e g biological instead of chemical production renewable instead of fossil based production the sustainable process index measures the land area required to sustainably produce a product or to perform any other activity the unit of measurement is land area per year and is the sum of the land area required to create all inputs e g raw material production waste assimilation or rainwater harvesting this method is considered to use ssis since the threshold value for this method is the amount of land area available the water security sustainability evaluation is proposed by nie et al their evaluation uses several indicators which relate water use to water availability 73 the combination of indicators used that meet the criteria for ssis are water resources vulnerability index water resources demand supply balance index and water availability index 4 4 material and energy flow analysis mefa mefa methods were used in 85 papers using ssis in 36 42 this is the highest use of ssis of the analyzed categories mefa is also the category with the highest growth rate of papers using ssis the underlying concepts of mass energy balancing are suitable for ssis because they can be used over any scale and can therefore be applied outside the immediate boundaries of the industrial system within the mefa category two sub categories were identified water footprint wf methods and energy flow analyses wf methods require an inventory of the amount of water required for a product service along the supply chain 74 these methods can reach the level of ssis by quantifying the impact of human activities on the natural water cycle energy flow analysis converts water use into an energy requirement for water use this conversion is related to the amount of energy involved in the natural hydrological cycle 75 or the amount of energy required for desalination 76 system sustainability is achieved when the energy embodied in water use is in balance with the availability of renewable energy 4 4 1 examples of water footprint wf at ssis level wf methods were combined with spatial data by li et al to evaluate the water footprint of different sectors 77 the spatial data on water use is combined with spatial data on water scarcity the water scarcity index this method makes it possible to scale the assessment based on the availability and detail of spatial data additionally the discharge of pollutants to water bodies gray water footprint is evaluated in relation to the availability of water which can assimilate pollutants method incorporating water scarcity with wf were also used by refs 78 79 to assess of the dairy industry yeh et al met the ssis criteria by including the hydrological balance of water bodies as a threshold value when assessing water use for bioenergy 80 with wf methods the hydrological balance relates the total water renewably available in a watershed with the water used for human purposes within the wf framework the available water remaining aware method has been developed the aware method provides an indication of the water remaining after the human and ecosystem demand has been met this method is used by northey et al to evaluate water use in the mining industry 81 82 the aware method is suitable for wf assessments but is also being adopted by the lca community to generate more accurate assessments for the water use impact category 60 61 4 4 2 examples of energy flow analysis at ssis level 83 84 evaluated human activities with the cumulative exergy extraction from the natural environment ceene method within the ceene method water use is expressed in terms of the energy requirements to obtain this water the ceene method makes a distinction between renewable and non renewable energy and can therefore evaluate system sustainability 83 84 emergy embodied energy emergy accounting methods are a valuable tool to gain insights into the water energy nexus 85 sun and an evaluate industrial sectors in terms of their long term sustainability by comparing the renewable emergy input to the total emergy input of the sector by including the renewable availability of emergy this methods is considered to use ssis with appropriate system boundaries emergy accounting methods can effectively incorporate the interaction between water use and energy use leading to effective evaluations of the water energy nexus 4 5 environmental accounting ea ea methods were used in 29 papers and used ssis 6 times 24 despite the internal debates within ea research explained in section 3 the inclusion of ssis is very close to the overall average 26 ea was combined with methods from other categories 14 times but did not lead to increased use of ssis in two the 14 combined papers 14 ssis were used 4 5 1 examples of environmental accounting at ssis level 86 used the total value added method to evaluate the environmental impacts of the textile dying industry the total value added method serves to assess different technological scenarios the ssis level is reached by relating current freshwater use to the available freshwater resources 86 87 utilize a strong sustainability i e considering ecosystem services not to be substitutable 88 framework to evaluate the net benefits of a mining project the above concept is able to evaluate system sustainability because the net benefits of economic activity are related to maintaining the resilience of essential natural life support systems on a local scale 87 the environmental performance resource impact method proposed by ref 89 evaluates environmental impacts against monetary value added this method allows manufacturers to assess the sustainability of suppliers meeting ssis criteria in the case of water use is achieved by comparing water use to available reserves in terms of the capacity of the natural environment to sustain further burdens this approach yields threshold values for the maximum extraction of water resources in line with the carrying capacity of the environment 89 4 6 life cycle analysis lca life cycle analysis methods were used in 160 papers the use of ssis through lca methods occurred in 25 papers 16 in 13 out of 40 papers 33 that combine lca methods with methods from other categories ssis were used lca is the only category in which the combination of methods increases the use of ssis there are two main aspects within lcas which can affect performance in terms of ssis 1 during the goal and scope definition phase the ambition level of the research is defined and the choice to incorporate ssis can be made and 2 technical data limitations in the life cycle inventory and life cycle impact analysis phases 90 hampering ssis use the extensive experience within the lca field combined with data unavailability can be the reason why level 4 indicators are used more often and ssi are intentionally used only on occasion often there is insufficient data to make a spatial differentiation for the impacts lca attempts to measure 91 within the lca field there are long term efforts to address this issue 92 in the face of data unavailability it may be impossible to use develop ssis and to ensure the feasibility of a study the recipe a lca method documentation states no models are available to express the damage of water depletion on the endpoint level and uses a midpoint indicator that simply expresses the total amount of water used 93 94 propose that 1 the spatial information of withdrawal and discharge locations 2 the quality of water flows and 3 the type of water course from which water is withdrawn or discharged e g wetland aquifer river sea should be included to evaluate water use through lca methods other options are to incorporate the water scarcity index into the water use impact category 59 95 or relating water use to freshwater fish species extinction 96 the increased availability and resolution of geographic data could be integrated with lca methods to link impact categories with local conditions this research shows that adoption of these improvements which would allow for ssis level assessments of water use is still limited within the lca methods used by industry decision makers should be aware that lca methods do not evaluate system sustainability by default until ssis become predominant in lca the consistency with which the category reaches level 4 can still be used to reduce environmental pressures the added value of combining lca methods with other categories is apparent and should be further developed further research on lca in the field of industrial water use should focus on 1 determining which data requirements are hampering incorporation of ssis and 2 raising the ambition level of assessments to evaluate system sustainability 4 6 1 examples of life cycle analysis at ssis level lévová hauschild expanded lca methods to account for spatial and temporal variations the impact of textile industries on ecosystems was assessed through the ratio of water used against water availability after environmental water requirements were taken into account 97 the inclusion of environmental water requirements allows for an evaluation of system sustainability the approach of lévová hauschild can be scaled to individual water catchments and thus allows for evaluation based on the local context 98 used lca methods to assess the impact of water use for bioethanol production on the local environment by relating it to local precipitation precipitation can be considered an approximation for available renewable water resources sandra l 99 and provides the threshold value required to relate water use to the carrying capacity of the local environment 98 100 used lca methods combined with mefa methods to assess agro bioenergy systems their method relates human resource utilization to what is retained or returned to nature 100 this procedure sets effective threshold values which can be related to carrying capacity and are therefore considered to be ssis the overlap and interactions between methodology categories kpi and lci can be seen in the work of liu and bakshi 101 in this work lca methods are combined with techno ecological synergy tes see section 4 2 metrics to expand on the traditional impact categories used within lca this procedure adds the elements necessary to evaluate the sustainability of resource use on any scale and makes it possible to include the local characteristics of the region in which resources are used and or emissions are discharged 4 7 industrial sectors and ssis the industrial sectors investigated in this research use ssis to different extents fig 4 the mixed sector where more than one industrial sector is evaluated within a single paper is the only sector in which ssis are used in the majority of studies 68 compared to the other sectors 20 this indicates that an active selection of ssis is taking place the holistic nature of assessments in the mixed sector steers for the selection of indicators exceeding the boundaries of a single company automatically resulting in ssis the manufacturing industry excluding the petrochemical sector uses lca methodologies in 52 of the papers and subsequently uses level 4 indicators most often 44 the use of level 2 indicators is most prevalent in the mining 36 and petrochemical 34 sectors fig 4 and is considerably higher than the overall use of level 2 indicators across all sectors 24 fig 2 the low frequency of ssis level evaluations within the waste processing 8 and petrochemical 11 sectors is noteworthy but is possibly attributed to their limited prevalence in the analyzed papers for the petrochemical industry the use of ssis should be a high priority since this sector at least in europe is the main water using industry within the manufacturing sector 14 we suggest that further research is done to understand why the use of ssis in assessment methods differs between industries this understanding is needed to ensure efforts are aimed at the limiting factor for the use of ssis this prevents the possible situation where efforts are made to increase data availability when the limiting factor is a lack of awareness or interest to assess system sustainability additionally the awareness concerning data availability can be different amongst sectors leading to different choices for assessment methods across industrial sectors the use ssis is attributed to different methodology categories fig 5 within the manufacturing industry mefa is used more often when reaching ssis compared to the mixed sector in the mixed sector most papers using ssis do so through kpis the difference between these sectors is the possibility to standardize methods the manufacturing sector can standardize methods associated with specific products through mefa or lca methods while the mixed sector needs kpis made specifically for the diverse group of industries and products being assessed 5 conclusions using suitable assessment methods is needed to ensure that industrial water use remains within the carrying capacity of the local environment sustainable systems indicators ssis are used in 26 of the reviewed scientific papers assessing the environmental sustainability of industrial water use the number of papers which use ssis has grown slower than the overall growth of papers assessing industrial water use as a result the gap between assessments that use ssis and do not use ssis is increasing in light of the projected changes in water availability and the increasing water demand of industry environmental assessments using ssis is needed to create sustainable water systems locally and globally analysis of 340 scientific papers on industrial water use shows that the use of ssis differs among assessment method categories 28 for key performance indicators 34 for composite indices 42 for material and energy flow analysis 24 for environmental accounting and 16 for life cycle analysis the use of ssis is highest in the mixed industry sector 68 where assessment methods are designed to evaluate several industries and companies simultaneously evaluating several industries forces the adoption of assessment methods which extend beyond the boundaries of a single industry or facility the mixed sector shows that deliberate selection of ssis is possible and adoption of this practice would improve performance in other sectors ssis are present in all methodological categories encountered in this research focusing on improving and increasing data availability for the existing assessment methods is therefore more beneficial than focusing on the development of new methods combining methods from different categories results in higher use of ssis for the lca 33 category but shows no added value for the other categories we suggest researchers take the criteria for ssis into account when assessing the sustainability of industrial water resource use and to take the methods already using ssis as a starting point when improving existing or developing new methods declarations of interest none acknowledgements this research is financed by the netherlands organisation for

8825,the projected increase of industrial water demands raises the need to assess the environmental sustainability of industrial water use assessment methods need to use sustainable systems indicators ssis which relate resource use to the carrying capacity of the local environment ssis for water use evaluate whether water use exceeds the natural water renewal quantity and whether emissions remain within the assimilation capacity of ecosystems quality we systematically reviewed the scientific literature to show which methods are used to assess industrial water use and of these which methods incorporate ssis in total 82 assessment methods were identified in 340 papers the methods were assigned to five categories key performance indicators composite indices environmental accounting material and energy flow analysis and life cycle analysis in 26 of the reviewed papers the assessment methods used ssis the number of papers incorporating ssis is growing at a slower rate than the overall number of papers in the area of sustainability assessments of industrial water use considering the expected growth in industrial water use this poses a risk to sustainable water use the best performing category in terms of incorporating ssis is material and energy flow analysis 42 of papers papers assessing several industrial sectors in the same study incorporate ssis more frequently 68 than research focused on a single industry or process 20 we discuss examples from the reviewed papers which successfully incorporate ssis in order to 1 identify the elements needed to create ssis for industrial water use 2 aid researchers and practitioners in selecting methods which incorporate ssis and 3 provide a starting point for future methodological development incorporating ssis graphical abstract image 1 keywords industrial water use environmental assessment methods environmental sustainability system sustainability 1 introduction both human societies and natural ecosystems depend on the availability of adequate water resources water is not only needed to satisfy basic human needs but is also crucial for sustainable economic development 1 on a global scale the rate at which water resources are naturally replenished is more than enough to meet the demand of humanity 2 however water resources and water demand are heterogeneously distributed around the globe this results in some areas having a water surplus while other areas have a water deficit on a local scale anthropogenic water use often exceeds the watersheds natural recharge rate resulting in water scarcity 3 global water demand is projected to increase from 3500 km3 year 1 in 2000 to around 5500 km3 year 1 in 2050 4 in many places around the world the response to the increasing water demand is to increase the extraction of non renewable water i e water not replenished through the hydrological cycle this leads to the overdraft of aquifers 5 depletion of surface reservoirs and ecosystem water shortages overdrafting the water resources needed to maintain the local ecosystems leads to the degradation of those ecosystems and ecosystem services on which societies depend 6 7 the aral sea disaster is one example of how local over extraction leads to ecosystem degradation the impact of this over extraction was the disappearance of fish populations desertification and decreased air quality which led to severe ecological and human welfare damage 8 the negative effects of water extraction can be avoided by balancing human water demand with renewable water availability for both the global and the local scale industry is one of the main users of water and their water use is expected to increase 4 water demand is expected to increase with 400 by 2050 4 for the manufacturing industry this increased industrial demand can have severe consequences on the local environment and ecosystems this paper focuses specifically on the environmental sustainability of industrial water use in terms of quantity and quality industrial water use needs to be based on sustainable water extraction rates that are adequately determined and evaluated several assessment methods have been developed to evaluate the sustainability of industrial water resource use 9 most of these assessment methods have been effective at increasing resource use efficiency 10 however increasing resource use efficiency alone is not enough to reach a sustainable system 10 to create a sustainable water system industries need assessment methods which can quantify their water use in relation to renewable water availability and the ability of ecosystems to purify pollutants across all relevant spatiotemporal scales the relationship between sustainability industrial or any other resource use and assessment methods is captured by the concept of sustainable systems indicators ssis introduced by ref 11 assessment methods using ssis link resource use to the carrying capacity of ecosystems providing the resources an evaluation of assessment methods based on the use of ssis has not yet been performed within the area of industrial water use with this in mind a review of the assessment methods themselves instead of their results is needed establishing which assessment methods effectively incorporate ssis for water use is needed to move past efficiency gains and towards sustainable industrial water use the interrelations between water use and energy use the water energy nexus are not addressed directly in this paper research objective the objective of this research is to gain insight into the effectiveness of commonly used assessment methods to evaluate the environmental sustainability of industrial water use this paper categorizes and qualitatively assesses the methods used to evaluate industrial water use based on data gathered through a systematic literature review the results of the review allow for more thorough selection of assessment methods and for better interpretation of assessment results additionally this review serves as a starting point for future assessment methodology development such a review is needed to adequately assess water resource use considering the natural variability in supply and the expected increases in industrial water demand the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methodology used for the review section 3 presents the background theory on assessment methodologies section 4 presents and discusses the extent to which ssis are incorporated in assessment methods and within industrial sectors and section 5 summarizes and concludes our findings 2 methodology 2 1 systematic review previous review papers on sustainability assessments of industrial systems i e 9 10 and 12 were used for a meta review to define the search strategy for this research table 1 and to guide the development of the evaluation framework papers found through the search strategy were screened according to four criteria 1 industry only articles focusing on industrial processes were included the industrial sectors included were energy production manufacturing mining petro chemical and waste processing the petro chemical industry is often considered part of the manufacturing industry 13 we make a distinction between the petro chemical and other manufacturing industry due to large quantities of water used in the petrochemical industry 14 by making this distinction the difference in assessment practices for these sectors can become apparent a mixed sector was created for papers that evaluated water use in multiple sectors industrial processes that focused on the refinement of agricultural products e g cheese and wine production fall under manufacturing category since raw materials are converted into a final product the production of agricultural products livestock or aquaculture were considered out of scope 2 environmental sustainability papers incorporating the environmental aspect of sustainability and more specifically the sustainability of water use quantity quality were included assessments solely addressing social or economic sustainability of industrial activities were excluded 3 assessment methodology the definition of a sustainability assessment method used by ref 9 is a method which can provide quantitative information that can potentially help industries to assess their environmental sustainability this definition was used to include papers articles elaborating on a product technology or industrial system that did not elaborate on the assessment method used to evaluate the product technology or industrial system were excluded 4 case studies the aim of this research is to identify the methods used to evaluate industrial water use in real cases papers elaborating on a specific industry or method to evaluate an industrial sector were included papers evaluating water resource use of a country or region were excluded 2 2 assessment framework the purpose of the assessment framework used in this research is to determine which assessment methods are suitable to evaluate the environmental sustainability of industrial water use the evaluation framework for this research is based on the lowell center for sustainable production lcsp indicator framework as developed by ref 11 the lcsp framework is used because it provides a structured way to evaluate assessment methods which focus specifically on environmental sustainability in this research the lcsp framework is used to determine the extent to which the indicators used in different assessment methods include threshold values based on the renewable availability of water resources the lcsp framework ranks indicators on 5 levels where indicators that reach level 5 can be considered sustainable systems indicators 11 the different levels are intended to be evolutionary meaning indicators that reach levels 1 through 4 are the building blocks to create level 5 indicators level 1 and 2 indicators limit assessment to processes and water resource use within the company facility boundaries level 3 and 4 indicators expand the boundary of the assessment to the effects of the company facility on the outside environment level 5 indicators place company facility resource use and emissions in relation with sustainable renewal rates of water resources and the assimilation capacity of the environment the lcsp framework has previously been used to evaluate sustainability indicators used in the petrochemical 15 and pharmaceutical industries 16 the framework has not yet been used to compare assessment methods specifically for industrial water use in this research the original criteria of the lcsp framework are used and operationalized to assess how ssis are incorporated in the assessment methods for water use in industry the different levels and associated operationalization of the lcsp framework for this research are shown in table 2 in the systematic review indicators were evaluated according to the criteria presented in table 2 irrespective of the aspect they assess such as water quality or quantity papers using several water related indicators were ranked based on the highest scoring indicator 3 theory after the brundtland report in 1987 the importance of sustainable development gained increased attention consequently methods were then needed to evaluate progress towards sustainable development 18 to date there is a multitude of assessment methods to evaluate the environmental sustainability of industrial systems 9 12 19 20 because of the plethora of methods categorization is required for further analysis 9 argue that the classification used by the oecd 21 is the most suitable since it is the closest to practice within industry and is used in this research the oecd classification consists of six categories 1 key performance indicators 2 socially responsible investment indices 3 composite indices 4 material and energy flow analysis 5 environmental accounting 6 life cycle analysis the interconnections between the proposed categories e g material and energy flow analysis and life cycle analysis 9 are relevant when determining if the combination of methodology categories results in better performance in terms of ssis the oecd categories used to group papers in this research are described in sections 3 1 3 6 3 1 key performance indicators kpis the selection and development of kpis aims to reduce the amount of data which needs to be collected and tracked to evaluate system performance key performance indicators kpis were originally used to evaluate the economic performance of organizations 9 more recently sets of kpis have been developed to evaluate the environmental sustainability of human activities careful selection of kpis is needed to make sure the complete system is evaluated 22 kpis do not always reveal the underlying reasons for system performance or show which changes are needed to improve performance 23 these shortcomings are reinforced by the fact that development and disclosure of environmental kpis is predominantly voluntary 24 while the selection of indicators is largely based on the realities values and culture of the organization using them 25 even so the implementation and monitoring of kpis is useful for tracking developments within an organization 26 3 2 composite indices ci composite indices ci are built by aggregating separate indicators kpis into a single metric according to a specified method 27 28 the apparent simplicity of ci outputs makes them appealing for policy and decision makers since large amounts of information can be condensed into more manageable and comparable values 28 the benefits of ci include ease of interpretation ability to rank alternatives facilitating communication and making performance and progress central within the policy arena 29 the main critique within ci research is the subjective nature of the weighing scales 12 30 determination of weights is generally done through participative expert inputs or non participatory methods 28 procedures such as the analytic hierarchy process 31 can be used to standardize the process of deriving priority weights but the input for such procedures still has a subjective nature the participatory method can be valuable in relation to ssis due to the possibility for local experts to give added emphasis to locally relevant issues after weight determination the individual kpis are aggregated to generate the final index the aggregating procedure can also have significant influence on the final outcome of the assessment 32 due to internal assumptions weighting and aggregating the outcome of a ci can yield different results when analyzing the same system the effects of this internal bias was shown when evaluating the overall sustainability of different countries 33 and where results were dependent on methodological choices the economic and social sustainability aspects included in many ci were not taken into account when evaluating ci papers based on the lcsp framework to evaluate ci methods according to the lcsp framework the underlying indicators specifically related to the environmental sustainability of water use were considered the weighting and aggregation steps of ci were not considered because these only affect the extent to which environmental economic and social sustainability are represented in the final index score 3 3 socially responsible investment indices sri sri are used by stakeholders and investors to benchmark the sustainability performance of organizations and corporations 21 in most cases this takes the form of a ranking list 9 over the last decades the number of corporate social responsibility indices and metrics for the assessment of corporate performance has steadily grown 34 while the underlying motives for companies to engage in corporate social responsibility can be debated 35 the development of sri does foster competition among companies to enhance their environmental performance 34 the environmental performance of companies measured through sri is frequently highlighted in sustainability reports 36 the extent to which sri reflects whether a company contributes to a sustainable future is still lacking in part because many sri do not yet relate company resource use to the carrying capacity of ecosystems 34 3 4 material and energy flow analysis mefa the underlying principle of mefa is the law of conservation of mass and energy 37 to assess the flows of materials or energy in a given system 38 39 the use of mefa to evaluate the environmental performance of human activities began in the 1970s 39 and has become an important tool for decision making in many fields 37 combination of mefa with other methodologies such as life cycle analysis is expected to increase accuracy and relevance and has been on the research agenda for years 37 mefa methods systematically quantify stocks and flows within the system and connect these to their respective sources and sinks mefa methods are frequently used in the life cycle inventory phase within life cycle analysis this approach makes it possible to relate resource utilization to the carrying capacity of the ecosystem 37 40 the above process is generally performed with either materials substances or energy as units of measurement there is a range of methodologies within mefa which can lead to differing outcomes for the same case based on the boundary conditions chosen 41 even so mefa make it possible to determine the direction of change in terms of resource utilization and material energy flows 42 3 5 environmental accounting ea environmental accounting methods convert environmental value ecosystem services to economic value in order to evaluate the costs or benefits of resource exploitation 9 conversion of environmental to economic value allows organizations to assess their environmental performance and report their progress to external stakeholders 43 the monetization of ecosystem services can make them subject to market mechanisms of exchange and sale 44 the exchange and sale of ecosystem services can be problematic when not all ecosystem services can be captured in a monetary value or there is missing knowledge on the interdependence of ecosystem services it is recognized that ea could theoretically contribute towards more sustainable practices but the current voluntary nature in contrast to economic accounting can also undermine this purpose in a world where decision maker acceptance of personal accountability is severely lacking 45 and organizations actively work to avoid accountability 46 it is hard to reconcile transparent disclosure with voluntary accountability without obligatory independent assessments the quality of ea is considered very low in comparison to traditional monetary accounting practices 47 additionally improvements tend to be overruled by business interests 48 despite the shortcomings of ea there are also arguments for the added value of this type of assessment 49 concludes that cost benefit analysis a sub methodology within ea does not tell regulators all they need to know but without it they will know far too little ea can be a powerful tool to inform decision makers about environmental sustainability and can be even more effective when used alongside other methods 50 3 6 life cycle analysis lca lca calculates the environmental impact of a product or service over its lifetime in the 1970 s lca mostly focused on the analysis of energy 51 since then lca methods have grown to cover a wide variety of environmental impacts 51 the most relevant impact categories in relation to water use are water use freshwater ecotoxicity marine ecotoxicity and freshwater eutrophication 52 between 1990 and 2000 lca entered policy and legislation as a tool for decision makers from 2000 to 2010 lca methods started to diverge in order to address some of the drawbacks of the method such as the limited system boundaries and allocation 53 currently lca methods are expanding from attributional lca alca to consequential lca clca 51 the alca focuses on the environmental impacts of specific products or services per functional unit of the product in clca the systems boundaries are increased to evaluate impacts over larger spatiotemporal scales and to investigate how resource flows and their associated environmental impacts will change as a consequence of changes in demand for the functional unit 54 the transition towards clca increases the complexity of analysis but also makes it possible to holistically assess environmental impacts 51 the strengths of lca include that it provides a comprehensive and structured investigation and assessment highlights potential environmental tradeoffs can challenge conventional wisdom advances the knowledge base and fosters communication and discourse 55 lca can also incorporate an increasing number of relevant impact categories and can be applied to a wide range of systems such as products industrial sectors or countries despite these strengths lca has limitations which hinder assessing system sustainability arguably the most prominent drawback is the difficulty for integration of results across different temporal and spatial scales 56 for some environmental impacts the location of emissions and associated effects are almost independent as is the case for ozone depletion and climate change 56 other environmental impacts can vary by orders of magnitude due to variations in local sensitivities 56 in addition to the above limitations lca is unable to account for changes of conditions outside the geographic system boundaries which can affect the system being studied 57 these issues are on the lca research agenda and have led to continuous improvements combining lca methodologies with other methods is being researched to overcome the above limitations 58 an example is the incorporation of water scarcity indicators into lca which makes it possible to relate the water use impact category to local conditions 59 the aware methodology is a recent development incorporating water scarcity on a spatial scale 60 61 4 results discussion 4 1 overall performance a total of 340 papers were analyzed table 1 and 82 assessment methods to evaluate industrial water use were identified see annex 1 for an overview of the methods identified and the lcsp level of the indicators used in these methods the sri methodology category was not encountered in any of the 340 papers evaluating the environmental sustainability of industrial water use papers matching the search criteria started appearing in 1995 and their prevalence grew up to 2018 fig 1 the large increase in kpis and ci papers in 2018 is due to a large number of papers combining methods in 2018 in 26 of the papers the assessment methods used matched ssis criteria but performance is not uniform across the oecd methodology categories fig 2 in relation to the total number of papers in each category the mefa category performs the best with regards to ssi use 42 while lca performs the worst 16 fig 2 papers using lca methods are the most prevalent 160 out of 340 and use level 4 indicators in 74 of the papers the prevalence of papers using lca methods with level 4 indicators causes overall performance to be at level 4 39 fig 2 the methods used in the majority of papers 74 are either not suitable to assess water use at the ssis level due to methodological limitations or there is a lack of ambition to reach this level of assessment the overall growth rate of papers using indicators with reach the level of ssis is lower than papers not using ssis fig 3 this is of concern because it shows that evaluating water use in relation to the carrying capacity of ecosystems using ssis is not yet assimilated within the research community on the topic of industrial water use decision making based on level 1 4 assessments can lead do degradation of ecosystems and the associated ecosystem services they provide the possibility to use ssis is closely linked to the availability of data the unavailability of accurate data across all spatial scales requires a trade off between precision and applicability 62 level 5 assessment methods ssis require extensive data on human activities as well as the carrying capacity of the local environment affected by human activities in relation to ssis data unavailability poses the following problem should researchers use ssis level 5 with insufficient data with the possibility of arriving at incorrect conclusions or use indicators with lower data requirements levels 1 4 with the knowledge that environmental sustainability cannot be fully assessed in either case ecosystems are at risk of over exploitation further research on the interactions between data availability and the choice to use methods with ssis is suggested for future research in 56 papers methods from two or three categories were combined when methods are combined there is a higher use of ssis 30 compared to papers which use a single method 25 table 3 the added value of combining methods from different categories is the largest for the lca category which increased from 16 to 33 when mefa and lca are combined with each other ssis use is the highest at 45 in sections 4 2 4 6 we discuss the performance of papers in each oecd category focusing on the methodological elements leading to the level of ssis in each section we first discuss the category in general then we provide examples of papers which use ssis and discuss why the indicators are considered ssis the example papers discussed in the following sections can serve as a starting point for future methodological development future methodological development can use the lcsp framework together with the examples provided to ensure ssis level indicators are used or argue why indicators at the ssis level are intentionally omitted 4 2 key performance indicators kpis kpis were encountered in 84 papers and of those 23 papers used ssis 28 in 19 papers where kpis were used the level of ssis was achieved without utilizing additional methods from other categories of the 16 papers where kpis were combined with methods from other categories 4 used ssis the predominant performance of papers using kpis is level 2 45 facility material use and performance indicators kpis generally focus on the performance and efficiency within the facility and therefore do not include the required environmental conditions outside the facility to assess system sustainability assessments at this level generally lead to efficiency gains instead of progress towards sustainable systems as explained by ref 10 4 2 1 examples of kpis at ssis level 63 provide a comprehensive set of indicators to assess the sustainability of industrial water use by linking water use to effects on the aquifers or water bodies from which water is taken to meet the criteria of ssis they combine performance indicators withdrawal by source m3 year 1 with concern indicators aquifers sources significantly affected by water withdrawal water risk at national level 63 this approach creates effective threshold values for the indicators to be considered ssis the techno ecological synergy tes method developed by ref 64 evaluates the demand for any ecosystem service e g water quality regulation or water provisioning service against the supply of this service on each ecological scale the tes method considers the demand site for resources to be a black box and evaluates whether flows in and out of the black box are in balance with the local environment the system is considered sustainable when the renewable supply is larger than the demand at the investigated scale the framework generates an indicator for any ecosystem service used by humans and relates the use of each service to the renewable availability over any spatial scale the tes methodology was applied to evaluate and optimize a methanol transesterification process 65 the optimization process takes the carrying capacity of local ecosystems into account and therefore accurately reflects the amount of economic activity which can be sustained for longer periods of time a modelling approach is taken by xu et al when optimizing water resource allocation in a coal chemical industrial park 66 they use the availability including the uncertainty of water resources provided by a river as a constraint to optimize water allocation by setting the sustainable availability as a constraint the resulting optimal solution is in line with the local carrying capacity of water systems aitken et al evaluate the water use of the mining industry in chile 67 by relating water use to water scarcity they calculate a water scarcity index wsi for a baseline scenario and in a scenario where environmental water requirements are included subsequently the impact of water use by mining on water scarcity are calculated by relating the water use of individual industries to overall water availability the approach meets the criteria for ssis the use of wsi has also been promoted in relation to water use within the lca community see section 4 6 4 3 composite indices ci in 14 of 41 cases 34 the indicators used in the ci category matched ssis criteria combining ci with methods from other categories occurred in 17 papers and resulted in ssis in four papers 24 ci perform better than kpis because the focus shifts from individual processes within the system to a broader evaluation of the system 4 3 1 examples of ci at ssis level zaharia et al used the global pollution index method to evaluate the environmental impacts of economic activities in general 68 and of a specific product 69 the global pollution index method relates the actual state of the environment as influenced by human activities to the ideal state of the environment this method matches the criteria for ssis although quantification of environmental states is challenging and is very data intensive the sustainable process index method was used in multiple cases i by ref 70 to evaluate industrial production in general ii by ref 71 to evaluate the sugar industry and iii by ref 72 to evaluate several industrial case studies e g biological instead of chemical production renewable instead of fossil based production the sustainable process index measures the land area required to sustainably produce a product or to perform any other activity the unit of measurement is land area per year and is the sum of the land area required to create all inputs e g raw material production waste assimilation or rainwater harvesting this method is considered to use ssis since the threshold value for this method is the amount of land area available the water security sustainability evaluation is proposed by nie et al their evaluation uses several indicators which relate water use to water availability 73 the combination of indicators used that meet the criteria for ssis are water resources vulnerability index water resources demand supply balance index and water availability index 4 4 material and energy flow analysis mefa mefa methods were used in 85 papers using ssis in 36 42 this is the highest use of ssis of the analyzed categories mefa is also the category with the highest growth rate of papers using ssis the underlying concepts of mass energy balancing are suitable for ssis because they can be used over any scale and can therefore be applied outside the immediate boundaries of the industrial system within the mefa category two sub categories were identified water footprint wf methods and energy flow analyses wf methods require an inventory of the amount of water required for a product service along the supply chain 74 these methods can reach the level of ssis by quantifying the impact of human activities on the natural water cycle energy flow analysis converts water use into an energy requirement for water use this conversion is related to the amount of energy involved in the natural hydrological cycle 75 or the amount of energy required for desalination 76 system sustainability is achieved when the energy embodied in water use is in balance with the availability of renewable energy 4 4 1 examples of water footprint wf at ssis level wf methods were combined with spatial data by li et al to evaluate the water footprint of different sectors 77 the spatial data on water use is combined with spatial data on water scarcity the water scarcity index this method makes it possible to scale the assessment based on the availability and detail of spatial data additionally the discharge of pollutants to water bodies gray water footprint is evaluated in relation to the availability of water which can assimilate pollutants method incorporating water scarcity with wf were also used by refs 78 79 to assess of the dairy industry yeh et al met the ssis criteria by including the hydrological balance of water bodies as a threshold value when assessing water use for bioenergy 80 with wf methods the hydrological balance relates the total water renewably available in a watershed with the water used for human purposes within the wf framework the available water remaining aware method has been developed the aware method provides an indication of the water remaining after the human and ecosystem demand has been met this method is used by northey et al to evaluate water use in the mining industry 81 82 the aware method is suitable for wf assessments but is also being adopted by the lca community to generate more accurate assessments for the water use impact category 60 61 4 4 2 examples of energy flow analysis at ssis level 83 84 evaluated human activities with the cumulative exergy extraction from the natural environment ceene method within the ceene method water use is expressed in terms of the energy requirements to obtain this water the ceene method makes a distinction between renewable and non renewable energy and can therefore evaluate system sustainability 83 84 emergy embodied energy emergy accounting methods are a valuable tool to gain insights into the water energy nexus 85 sun and an evaluate industrial sectors in terms of their long term sustainability by comparing the renewable emergy input to the total emergy input of the sector by including the renewable availability of emergy this methods is considered to use ssis with appropriate system boundaries emergy accounting methods can effectively incorporate the interaction between water use and energy use leading to effective evaluations of the water energy nexus 4 5 environmental accounting ea ea methods were used in 29 papers and used ssis 6 times 24 despite the internal debates within ea research explained in section 3 the inclusion of ssis is very close to the overall average 26 ea was combined with methods from other categories 14 times but did not lead to increased use of ssis in two the 14 combined papers 14 ssis were used 4 5 1 examples of environmental accounting at ssis level 86 used the total value added method to evaluate the environmental impacts of the textile dying industry the total value added method serves to assess different technological scenarios the ssis level is reached by relating current freshwater use to the available freshwater resources 86 87 utilize a strong sustainability i e considering ecosystem services not to be substitutable 88 framework to evaluate the net benefits of a mining project the above concept is able to evaluate system sustainability because the net benefits of economic activity are related to maintaining the resilience of essential natural life support systems on a local scale 87 the environmental performance resource impact method proposed by ref 89 evaluates environmental impacts against monetary value added this method allows manufacturers to assess the sustainability of suppliers meeting ssis criteria in the case of water use is achieved by comparing water use to available reserves in terms of the capacity of the natural environment to sustain further burdens this approach yields threshold values for the maximum extraction of water resources in line with the carrying capacity of the environment 89 4 6 life cycle analysis lca life cycle analysis methods were used in 160 papers the use of ssis through lca methods occurred in 25 papers 16 in 13 out of 40 papers 33 that combine lca methods with methods from other categories ssis were used lca is the only category in which the combination of methods increases the use of ssis there are two main aspects within lcas which can affect performance in terms of ssis 1 during the goal and scope definition phase the ambition level of the research is defined and the choice to incorporate ssis can be made and 2 technical data limitations in the life cycle inventory and life cycle impact analysis phases 90 hampering ssis use the extensive experience within the lca field combined with data unavailability can be the reason why level 4 indicators are used more often and ssi are intentionally used only on occasion often there is insufficient data to make a spatial differentiation for the impacts lca attempts to measure 91 within the lca field there are long term efforts to address this issue 92 in the face of data unavailability it may be impossible to use develop ssis and to ensure the feasibility of a study the recipe a lca method documentation states no models are available to express the damage of water depletion on the endpoint level and uses a midpoint indicator that simply expresses the total amount of water used 93 94 propose that 1 the spatial information of withdrawal and discharge locations 2 the quality of water flows and 3 the type of water course from which water is withdrawn or discharged e g wetland aquifer river sea should be included to evaluate water use through lca methods other options are to incorporate the water scarcity index into the water use impact category 59 95 or relating water use to freshwater fish species extinction 96 the increased availability and resolution of geographic data could be integrated with lca methods to link impact categories with local conditions this research shows that adoption of these improvements which would allow for ssis level assessments of water use is still limited within the lca methods used by industry decision makers should be aware that lca methods do not evaluate system sustainability by default until ssis become predominant in lca the consistency with which the category reaches level 4 can still be used to reduce environmental pressures the added value of combining lca methods with other categories is apparent and should be further developed further research on lca in the field of industrial water use should focus on 1 determining which data requirements are hampering incorporation of ssis and 2 raising the ambition level of assessments to evaluate system sustainability 4 6 1 examples of life cycle analysis at ssis level lévová hauschild expanded lca methods to account for spatial and temporal variations the impact of textile industries on ecosystems was assessed through the ratio of water used against water availability after environmental water requirements were taken into account 97 the inclusion of environmental water requirements allows for an evaluation of system sustainability the approach of lévová hauschild can be scaled to individual water catchments and thus allows for evaluation based on the local context 98 used lca methods to assess the impact of water use for bioethanol production on the local environment by relating it to local precipitation precipitation can be considered an approximation for available renewable water resources sandra l 99 and provides the threshold value required to relate water use to the carrying capacity of the local environment 98 100 used lca methods combined with mefa methods to assess agro bioenergy systems their method relates human resource utilization to what is retained or returned to nature 100 this procedure sets effective threshold values which can be related to carrying capacity and are therefore considered to be ssis the overlap and interactions between methodology categories kpi and lci can be seen in the work of liu and bakshi 101 in this work lca methods are combined with techno ecological synergy tes see section 4 2 metrics to expand on the traditional impact categories used within lca this procedure adds the elements necessary to evaluate the sustainability of resource use on any scale and makes it possible to include the local characteristics of the region in which resources are used and or emissions are discharged 4 7 industrial sectors and ssis the industrial sectors investigated in this research use ssis to different extents fig 4 the mixed sector where more than one industrial sector is evaluated within a single paper is the only sector in which ssis are used in the majority of studies 68 compared to the other sectors 20 this indicates that an active selection of ssis is taking place the holistic nature of assessments in the mixed sector steers for the selection of indicators exceeding the boundaries of a single company automatically resulting in ssis the manufacturing industry excluding the petrochemical sector uses lca methodologies in 52 of the papers and subsequently uses level 4 indicators most often 44 the use of level 2 indicators is most prevalent in the mining 36 and petrochemical 34 sectors fig 4 and is considerably higher than the overall use of level 2 indicators across all sectors 24 fig 2 the low frequency of ssis level evaluations within the waste processing 8 and petrochemical 11 sectors is noteworthy but is possibly attributed to their limited prevalence in the analyzed papers for the petrochemical industry the use of ssis should be a high priority since this sector at least in europe is the main water using industry within the manufacturing sector 14 we suggest that further research is done to understand why the use of ssis in assessment methods differs between industries this understanding is needed to ensure efforts are aimed at the limiting factor for the use of ssis this prevents the possible situation where efforts are made to increase data availability when the limiting factor is a lack of awareness or interest to assess system sustainability additionally the awareness concerning data availability can be different amongst sectors leading to different choices for assessment methods across industrial sectors the use ssis is attributed to different methodology categories fig 5 within the manufacturing industry mefa is used more often when reaching ssis compared to the mixed sector in the mixed sector most papers using ssis do so through kpis the difference between these sectors is the possibility to standardize methods the manufacturing sector can standardize methods associated with specific products through mefa or lca methods while the mixed sector needs kpis made specifically for the diverse group of industries and products being assessed 5 conclusions using suitable assessment methods is needed to ensure that industrial water use remains within the carrying capacity of the local environment sustainable systems indicators ssis are used in 26 of the reviewed scientific papers assessing the environmental sustainability of industrial water use the number of papers which use ssis has grown slower than the overall growth of papers assessing industrial water use as a result the gap between assessments that use ssis and do not use ssis is increasing in light of the projected changes in water availability and the increasing water demand of industry environmental assessments using ssis is needed to create sustainable water systems locally and globally analysis of 340 scientific papers on industrial water use shows that the use of ssis differs among assessment method categories 28 for key performance indicators 34 for composite indices 42 for material and energy flow analysis 24 for environmental accounting and 16 for life cycle analysis the use of ssis is highest in the mixed industry sector 68 where assessment methods are designed to evaluate several industries and companies simultaneously evaluating several industries forces the adoption of assessment methods which extend beyond the boundaries of a single industry or facility the mixed sector shows that deliberate selection of ssis is possible and adoption of this practice would improve performance in other sectors ssis are present in all methodological categories encountered in this research focusing on improving and increasing data availability for the existing assessment methods is therefore more beneficial than focusing on the development of new methods combining methods from different categories results in higher use of ssis for the lca 33 category but shows no added value for the other categories we suggest researchers take the criteria for ssis into account when assessing the sustainability of industrial water resource use and to take the methods already using ssis as a starting point when improving existing or developing new methods declarations of interest none acknowledgements this research is financed by the netherlands organisation for

8826,in this study an integration of pre treated magnesite lime and co2 bubbling mlc was used for the treatment of acid mine drainage amd the primary aim was to reclaim clean water and synthesize valuable minerals this treatment process comprises three steps which include neutralisation i using magnesite gypsum synthesis ii using lime and limestone synthesis iii using co2 bubbling reactors at a semi pilot scale system were used to fulfil the goals of this study amd was mixed with magnesite and lime at 1 g 100 ml s l and 8 g 100 ml s l ratios respectively pilot results revealed that amorphous hydroxides of fe gypsum and limestone can be obtained from the secondary sludge product the obtained materials were of high purity 75 this was further confirmed by x ray diffraction x ray fluorescence and fourier transform infrared spectrometer analytical techniques the product water was suitable for irrigation industrial and agricultural use as per south african standards furthermore it was observed that the initial ph of amd was 2 5 and it was increased to ph 10 and 12 after contacting magnesite and lime respectively to stabilise the ph co2 was bubbled and the ph was reduced to 7 29 which was suitable for a number of applications moreover 99 and 95 of metal species and sulphate were removed from an aqueous system respectively the techno economic evaluation indicated that it can cost r806 40 66 usd to treat 3 5 kl of acid mine drainage and have a return of r11263 60 933 usd from the selling of the recovered materials thus making this technology economically viable from the findings of this study it can be concluded that the application of mlc process can neutralise amd and produce valuable products more so this novel and self sustainable project will therefore go a long way in curtailing the impacts of amd by valorising the product minerals and exploit the resultant commercial value hence aiding in off setting the running costs of the treatment process graphical

and bio availability of metals species hence raising the concentration to unacceptable and often toxic levels 4 8 14 the adverse effects of acidification on aquatic ecosystems are associated with deteriorating quality of water in the receiving environment destruction of the bicarbonate buffer neutralizing capacity of water the loss of bicarbonate dependant photosynthetic organisms as bicarbonate is consumed the reduction and eventual cessation of nutrient cycling processes in water bodies and loss of organisms through damage to carbonate exoskeletons or cell components 15 16 the most visual legacy of amd is undoubtedly the precipitation of ferric fe3 hydroxide and oxy hydroxide and oxy hydrosulphates complexes as a yellow or orange coating in stream channels 17 18 these precipitates lead to a reduction in dissolved oxygen concentrations in affected water bodies during their formation and have abrasive effects on biota and clog streambeds once formed it can also prevent the penetration of light to aquatic ecosystem hence suffocating aquatic organisms 19 23 in south africa recent studies have reported that there are enormous volumes of amd produced by the western basin on the west rand basin in gauteng province that amount to 60 ml d carrying sulphate so4 concentrations of 4 5 5 g l and ferrous iron fe2 concentrations of up to 1 5 g l depending on seasons and host rock during and after rainfall it can even go beyond that limit 2 10 the mpumalanga coal basins can have up to 18 g l of sulphate and 6 g l of fe species 10 18 24 worldwide a number

drainage is depicted by fig 2 below as shown in fig 2 calcined cryptocrystalline magnesite lime and co2 bubbling mlc process was used to recover valuable minerals that have commercial value and to produce water that is fit for many defined uses such as irrigation and industrial processes the minerals recovery and water reclamation process used authentic amd from coal mining processes a sequential and fractional precipitation approach was employed to precipitate metals as hydroxide in the first reactor masindi gitari tutu and de beer 9 reported that the interaction of magnesite with amd lead to the precipitation of metals as hydroxides solids magnesium formed a complex of mgso4 l on contact with sulphate rich mine water eq 3 the sulphate was taken to a lime reactor interaction of lime and magnesium sulphate will lead to the formation of gypsum solids as shown by the reactions below 65 66 2 cao h 2 o ca oh 2 3 mgso 4 l ca oh 2 s h 2 o mg oh 2 s caso 4 h 2 o s for formation of gypsum eq 3 as a result of ion exchange between mgso 4 l and ca oh 2 s the following applies table species present mg2 ions and so4 2 ions from mgso4 complex ca2 ions and oh ions from ca oh 2 h ions and oh ions from dissociation of water h2o molecules solvent species that could be reduced mg2 ions ca2 ions h ions negligible because concentration is low as the mixture is very alkaline at this stage h2o molecules as h2o molecules have the highest standard potential compared to mg2 ions and ca2 ions they will be reduced 4 reduction half reaction 2 h 2 o l 2 e h 2 g 2 oh aq mg2 has a higher standard potential than ca2 ions and oh ions have the lowest standard potential so4 2 ions therefore mg2 will bond with oh ions and ca2 with so4 2 table species that could be oxidised so4 2 ions oh

oxidation half reaction 2 h 2 o l o 2 g 4 h 4 e to balance the two half reactions the oxidation half reaction is multiplied by 2 6 overall redox reaction 6 h 2 o l o 2 g 4 h 2 oh 2 h 2 g this makes sense as the introduction of h reduces the ph of the medium as the reaction proceeds further with continuous precipitation of magnesium and calcium which contribute to high alkalinity the produced h and oh ions form water that has undergone treatment the ph is further reduced by co2 eq 7 the residual calcium reacted with co2 to stabilise the ph and remove ca as limestone as shown in eq 4 7 co 2 g ca aq 2 h 2 o caco 3 s 2 h in this reaction chemistry and thermodynamics co 2 g is a typical acid forming gas because when it dissolves in water it forms carbonic acid the cationic acid donates the protons hydrogen ions and form bicarbonate ions the bicarbonate ions donates protons and generates a carbonate ion 8 co 2 h 2 o h 2 co 3 aq 9 h 2 co 3 aq hco 3 aq h aq 10 hco 3 aq co 3 aq 2 h aq the

is suitable for other defined uses 2 3 1 neutralization of amd field amd samples were treated using calcined cryptocrystalline magnesite at 60 mins of equilibration 1 g 100 ml s l ratios 650 rpm shaking speed and 32 µm particle size as reported by masindi gitari tutu and de beer 12 physico chemical parameters were determined as mentioned in section 2 2 validity of the obtained results was maintained by inter laboratory analysis in accredited laboratories and executing experiments in triplicate with the data reported as mean value 2 3 2 synthesis of gypsum an industrial grade lime was used as a precursor for synthesis of gypsum lime was added to magnesite treated water which is rich in magnesium sulphate specified grams of lime were added into the reactor at 8 g 100 ml s l ratios as reported by benatti tavares and lenzi 67 the mixture was equilibrated at 650 rpm shaking speed for 60 mins using an overhead stirrer the resultant residues and water were taken for analysis as described in section 2 2 2 3 3 synthesis of limestone an industrial grade carbon dioxide co2 from afrox was used for precipitation of limestone caco3 carbon dioxide was bubbled through magnesite treated water from the bottom of the reactor as shown in fig 2 the ph meter was also dipped into water to monitor the ph fluctuations due to legislative requirements the targeted ph was maintained at a range of 7 7 5 the resultant residues and water were taken for analysis as described in section 2 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment of authentic amd effluents the chemical compositions of amd before and after contacting magnesite lime reacted water and co2 bubble water are shown in table 1 the initial ph of amd used in this study was observed to be 2 5 it was therefore increased to 10 12 and 7 3 after using calcined cryptocrystalline magnesite lime and co2 bubbling respectively the total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec were also observed to have decreased on a stepwise fashion for magnesite lime and co2 treated waters a reduction in tds and ec may be attributed to precipitation of notable quantities of dissolved metal species and sulphates from aqueous system the sulphate recorded in this sample was 11 789 mg l making this anion dominant major cations included ca mg al mn and fe the predominance of fe and so4 2 indicated that this mine water was subjected to pyrite oxidation from the obtained results the treated water is suitable for irrigation as shown in the dws water quality guidelines some parameters were within the who waste quality standard hence requiring the water to be further treated for it to meet the drinking water quality specifications 3 2 mineralogy characterisation the mineralogical compositions of hydroxides gypsum and limestone are presented in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 a the product from the magnesite reactor was rich in brucite gypsum calcite quartz and hydrotalcite this may be attributed to the formation of gypsum from the reaction of ca and sulphate in water brucite may be originating from the precipitation of magnesium from solution quartz is from feed magnesite as reported in literature 68 the reaction of magnesite treated water resulted in the formation of basanite gypsum brucite quartz and montmorillonite fig 3 b calcium sulphate constituted 57 24 and brucite was 37 66 this may be explained by the information in literature that indicates that mg precipitates at ph 10 69 the rest were impurities of si and al as shown in fig 3 c the synthesis of limestone yielded a high purity material similar results were reported by benatti tavares and lenzi 67 as shown in fig 3 c aragonite and brucite were the major components this may be attributed to the reaction of carbon dioxide with calcium leading to the formation of calcium carbonate moreover hydromagnesite was also observed hence indicating that carbon dioxide is also reacting with residual magnesium the purity of limestone is 70 45 and fractions of magnesium based materials 27 94 hence making this product the best candidate for agricultural purposes 3 3 x ray fluorescence analysis the elemental composition wt of hydroxides gypsum and limestone are shown in table 2 as shown in table 2 the elemental composition wt of synthesized hydroxides gypsum and limestone after the interaction of calcine cryptocrystalline magnesite with amd the content of fe al and sulphate in the resultant residues were high hence indicating that there was precipitation of chemical species from amd during the reaction process this corresponds very well with the quality of product water and the xrd results similar results were reported by masindi ndiritu and maree 69 ca and s were also observed to be resent at notable levels hence indicating a possible precipitation of gypsum this can also be confirmed by xrd results mg was also observed to have increased in the product residue hence indicating the formation of brucite as depicted by the xrd peaks after bubbling co2 there was an increase in ca and co2 contents thus proving that limestone was formed the obtained results are well aligned to the xrd results 3 4 scanning electron microscope sem analysis sem was utilized to assess the change in morphology of the starting materials and resulting solid residues fig 4 a and b shows the morphology of calcined cryptocrystalline magnesite at different magnifications fig 4 c and d shows the morphological changes that took place after interaction of calcined cryptocrystalline magnesite with amd as shown in fig 4 before contacting amd the morphology of calcined cryptocrystalline magnesite contained spherical and leafy like shaped structures hence indicating that the material is heterogeneous after contacting the amd there was platelet sheet and rod like structures which were observed hence indicating that there was precipitation of metals from the treatment of acid mine drainage this verifies the results obtained from xrf and xrd bulky solution precipitation could be responsible for the formation of mineral phases which are deposited in between the secondary residues to form fibre like rod shaped and grape structured lumps of tetrahedral folding appearances thereby acting as a binding link between the micro particles hence the dense lumps observed in the sem micrographs three main features are observed in the solid residues by sem technique fig 4 c and d appearance of spherical rod and fibre like and aggregated lump like structures indicates formation of new mineral phases in the solid residues rods like structures of varying length and thickness some are flat shaped and are observed over the whole solid residue samples lumps with aggregated substances that are lamella and rose like shaped aggregation of the small particles forming lumps and rod and grape tetrahedral folding appearances and shaped structures with varying sizes hence confirming the deposition of new mineral phases sheet of flowers like structures outflowing in a petal fashion and arrangement the sem images of industrial grade lime synthesized gypsum and industrial grade gypsum are shown in fig 5 a f the industrial grade lime was observed to have spherical and compacted morphology the synthesized gypsum showed the presence of rod like structures and aggregated rods similar results were observed for industrial grade gypsum this shows that the synthesized product is gypsum with minor impurities as indicated by the xrd the synthesized limestone and industrial grade limestone are shown in fig 6 a d both synthesized and industrial grade limestone contained some rod and carrots like structures the morphology was homogenous hence indicating that the recovered material in very pure and contain less impurities 3 5 high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem analyses the tem diffraction mapping and micrographs of synthesized gypsum are shown in fig 7 the tem micrographs indicated the presence of rod like structures fig 7 e and f this was conforming to the results reported in sem micrographs fig 7 c and d the hr tem mapping indicated that the rods contains ca o and s hence proving that the material that is being synthesized is caso4 fig 7 a d this was further supported by the xrd results the precipitation of sulphur could also be better explained by the product water and xrf results 3 6 surface area the surface area of hydroxide gypsum and limestone are shown in table 3 as shown in table 3 the obtained results revealed that the surface area of recovered hydroxides was the lowest followed by limestone and gypsum this is an indication that these materials can be used as additives to a number of metallurgical processes 3 7 thermal stability thermogravimetric analysis tga is a method used to determine the amount of weight loss in a material as a function of increasing temperature or isothermally as a function of time in an atmosphere of nitrogen helium air other gas or in vacuum 70 thermal stability of hydroxide gypsum and limestone are shown in fig 8 tga plots obtained from the hydroxide gypsum and limestone analyses are shown in fig 8 all chemical components showed some weight loss with an increase in temperature hydroxide and gypsum showed the same trends a sharp decrease in weight at 400 c is attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups from the mineral matrices and interlayers for limestone two stages of weight loss were observed there is one at 400 c which indicates a water loss and another one at 700 c which indicate the release of co2 during the thermal conversion of limestone to lime sdiri higashi hatta jamoussi and tase 71 reported that caco3 decompose at 740 990 c 3 8 ftir the recovered and synthesized fe species minerals were further investigated using ftir analysis as shown in fig 9 the functional groups for metals hydroxide gypsum and limestone are shown in tables 4 6 below the obtained results corroborate the xrd results which surfaced the presence of gypsum quartz and calcite for metals hydroxide table 4 the functional groups of recovered metals hydroxides are shown in table 4 the functional groups of synthesized gypsum are shown in table 5 as confirmed by xrd and ftir results the synthesized material was rich in sulphate quartz and hydroxyl group this is consistent to the xrd and xrf results the functional groups of recovered metals hydroxides are shown in table 6 as shown in table 6 the synthesized limestone was observed to be rich in carbonates quartz and hydroxyl ions this aligns very well to the xrd and xrf results it also confirms the major weight loss in tga results because oh group was escaping with an increase in temperature moreover the carbonate fraction was also escaping due to thermal activation leading to the formation of cao 4 techno economic evaluation this study will only focus on the operational expenditure for the treatment process table 7 shows the operational expenditure for the running of the proposed plant as shown in table 7 it can only cost r230 4 19 usd to produce a kilolitre kl of treated water and r806 40 66 usd to produce 3 5 kl of treated water using the proposed technology however from the resale of the recovered materials such as fe based minerals from the hydroxide reactor gypsum from the lime reactor and limestone from co2 reactor a net profit of r11263 60 933 usd may be recovered this indicates that the operators can spend r806 40 for treating 3 5 kl of amd and have a margin profit of r11263 60 933 usd from the selling of the recovered products 5 conclusion this study successfully proved that an integration of magnesite lime and co2 bubbling mlc process can be used to treat acid mine drainage amd and produce valuable products such as water suitable for discharge industrial applications and irrigation purposes was reclaimed valuable minerals that has commercial value and they includes fe hydroxides gypsum and limestone recovered and synthesized materials were of high purity 75 this was further confirmed by x ray diffraction xrf and ftir from icp ms the water results showed that the initial ph of amd was 2 5 and it increased to ph 10 and 12 after contacting magnesite and lime respectively post co2 bubbling the ph was reduced to 7 29 and approximately 99 and 95 of chemical species and sulphate were removed from an aqueous system respectively techno economic evaluation indicated that it can cost r806 40 66 usd to treat 3 5 kl of acid mine drainage and have a return of r11263 60 933 usd from the resale of the recovered materials from the findings of this study it can be concluded that this novel study will go a long way in curtailing the impact of amd by recovering and synthesizing valuable materials that have commercial value the recovery of valuable materials will aid in off setting the running costs of the treatment process through their resale hence making the technology self sustaining acknowledgement

drainage is depicted by fig 2 below as shown in fig 2 calcined cryptocrystalline magnesite lime and co2 bubbling mlc process was used to recover valuable minerals that have commercial value and to produce water that is fit for many defined uses such as irrigation and industrial processes the minerals recovery and water reclamation process used authentic amd from coal mining processes a sequential and fractional precipitation approach was employed to precipitate metals as hydroxide in the first reactor masindi gitari tutu and de beer 9 reported that the interaction of magnesite with amd lead to the precipitation of metals as hydroxides solids magnesium formed a complex of mgso4 l on contact with sulphate rich mine water eq 3 the sulphate was taken to a lime reactor interaction of lime and magnesium sulphate will lead to the formation of gypsum solids as shown by the reactions below 65 66 2 cao h 2 o ca oh 2 3 mgso 4 l ca oh 2 s h 2 o mg oh 2 s caso 4 h 2 o s for formation of gypsum eq 3 as a result of ion exchange between mgso 4 l and ca oh 2 s the following applies table species present mg2 ions and so4 2 ions from mgso4 complex ca2 ions and oh ions from ca oh 2 h ions and oh ions from dissociation of water h2o molecules solvent species that could be reduced mg2 ions ca2 ions h ions negligible because concentration is low as the mixture is very alkaline at this stage h2o molecules as h2o molecules have the highest standard potential compared to mg2 ions and ca2 ions they will be reduced 4 reduction half reaction 2 h 2 o l 2 e h 2 g 2 oh aq mg2 has a higher

sense as the introduction of h reduces the ph of the medium as the reaction proceeds further with continuous precipitation of magnesium and calcium which contribute to high alkalinity the produced h

ca aq 2 h 2 o caco 3 s 2 h in this reaction chemistry and thermodynamics co 2 g is a typical acid forming gas because when it dissolves in water it forms carbonic acid the cationic acid donates the

is suitable for other defined uses 2 3 1 neutralization of amd field amd samples were treated using calcined cryptocrystalline magnesite at 60 mins of equilibration 1 g 100 ml s l ratios 650 rpm shaking speed and 32 µm particle size as reported by masindi gitari tutu and de beer 12 physico chemical parameters were determined as mentioned in section 2 2 validity of the obtained results was maintained by inter laboratory analysis in accredited laboratories and executing experiments in triplicate with the data reported as mean value 2 3 2 synthesis of gypsum an industrial grade lime was used as a precursor for synthesis of gypsum lime was added to magnesite treated water which is rich in magnesium sulphate specified grams of lime were added into the reactor at 8 g 100 ml s l ratios as reported by benatti tavares and lenzi 67 the mixture was equilibrated at 650 rpm shaking speed for 60 mins using an overhead stirrer the resultant residues and water were taken for analysis as described in section 2 2 2 3 3 synthesis of limestone an industrial grade carbon dioxide co2 from afrox was used for precipitation of limestone caco3 carbon dioxide was bubbled through magnesite treated water from the bottom of the reactor as shown in fig 2 the ph meter was also dipped into water to monitor the ph fluctuations due to legislative requirements the targeted ph was maintained at a range of 7 7 5 the resultant residues and water were taken for analysis as described in section 2 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 treatment of authentic amd effluents the chemical compositions of amd before and after contacting magnesite lime reacted water and co2 bubble water are shown in table 1 the initial ph of amd used in this study was observed to be 2 5 it was therefore increased to 10 12 and 7 3 after using calcined cryptocrystalline magnesite lime and co2 bubbling respectively the total dissolved solids tds and electrical conductivity ec were also observed to have decreased on a stepwise fashion for magnesite lime and co2 treated waters a reduction in tds and ec may be attributed to precipitation of notable quantities of dissolved metal species and sulphates from aqueous system the sulphate recorded in this sample was 11 789 mg l making this anion dominant major cations included ca mg al mn and fe the predominance of fe and so4 2 indicated that this mine water was subjected to pyrite oxidation from the obtained results the treated water is suitable for irrigation as shown in the dws water quality guidelines some parameters were within the who waste quality standard hence requiring the water to be further treated for it to meet the drinking water quality specifications 3 2 mineralogy characterisation the mineralogical compositions of hydroxides gypsum and limestone are presented in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 a the product from the magnesite reactor was rich in brucite gypsum calcite quartz and hydrotalcite this may be attributed to the formation of gypsum from the reaction of ca and sulphate in water brucite may be originating from the precipitation of magnesium from solution quartz is from feed magnesite as reported in literature 68 the reaction of magnesite treated water resulted in the formation of basanite gypsum brucite quartz and montmorillonite fig 3 b calcium sulphate constituted 57 24 and brucite was 37 66 this may be explained by the information in literature that indicates that mg precipitates at ph 10 69 the rest were impurities of si and al as shown in fig 3 c the synthesis of limestone yielded a high purity material similar results were reported by benatti tavares and lenzi 67 as shown in fig 3 c aragonite and brucite were the major components this may be attributed to the reaction of carbon dioxide with calcium leading to the formation of calcium carbonate moreover hydromagnesite was also observed hence indicating that carbon dioxide is also reacting with residual magnesium the purity of limestone is 70 45 and fractions of magnesium based materials 27 94 hence making this product the best candidate for agricultural purposes 3 3 x ray fluorescence analysis the elemental composition wt of hydroxides gypsum and limestone are shown in table 2 as shown in table 2 the elemental composition wt of synthesized hydroxides gypsum and limestone after the interaction of calcine cryptocrystalline magnesite with amd the content of fe al and sulphate in the resultant residues were high hence indicating that there was precipitation of chemical species from amd during the reaction process this corresponds very well with the quality of product water and the xrd results similar results were reported by masindi ndiritu and maree 69 ca and s were also observed to be resent at notable levels hence indicating a possible precipitation of gypsum this can also be confirmed by xrd results mg was also observed to have increased in the product residue hence indicating the formation of brucite as depicted by the xrd peaks after bubbling co2 there was an increase in ca and co2 contents thus proving that limestone was formed the obtained results are well aligned to the xrd results 3 4 scanning electron microscope sem analysis sem was utilized to assess the change in morphology of the starting materials and resulting solid residues fig 4 a and b shows the morphology of calcined cryptocrystalline magnesite at different magnifications fig 4 c and d shows the morphological changes that took place after interaction of calcined cryptocrystalline magnesite with amd as shown in fig 4 before contacting amd the morphology of calcined cryptocrystalline magnesite contained spherical and leafy like shaped structures hence indicating that the material is heterogeneous after contacting the amd there was platelet sheet and rod like structures which were observed hence indicating that there was precipitation of metals from the treatment of acid mine drainage this verifies the results obtained from xrf and xrd bulky solution precipitation could be responsible for the formation of mineral phases which are deposited in between the secondary residues to form fibre like rod shaped and grape structured lumps of tetrahedral folding appearances thereby acting as a binding link between the micro particles hence the dense lumps observed in the sem micrographs three main features are observed in the solid residues by sem technique fig 4 c and d appearance of spherical rod and fibre like and aggregated lump like structures indicates formation of new mineral phases in the solid residues rods like structures of varying length and thickness some are flat shaped and are observed over the whole solid residue samples lumps with aggregated substances that are lamella and rose like shaped aggregation of the small particles forming lumps and rod and grape tetrahedral folding appearances and shaped structures with varying sizes hence confirming the deposition of new mineral phases sheet of flowers like structures outflowing in a petal fashion and arrangement the sem images of industrial grade lime synthesized gypsum and industrial grade gypsum are shown in fig 5 a f the industrial grade lime was observed to have spherical and compacted morphology the synthesized gypsum showed the presence of rod like structures and aggregated rods similar results were observed for industrial grade gypsum this shows that the synthesized product is gypsum with minor impurities as indicated by the xrd the synthesized limestone and industrial grade limestone are shown in fig 6 a d both synthesized and industrial grade limestone contained some rod and carrots like structures the morphology was homogenous hence indicating that the recovered material in very pure and contain less impurities 3 5 high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem analyses the tem diffraction mapping and micrographs of synthesized gypsum are shown in fig 7 the tem micrographs indicated the presence of rod like structures fig 7 e and f this was conforming to the results reported in sem micrographs fig 7 c and d the hr tem mapping indicated that the rods contains ca o and s hence proving that the material that is being synthesized is caso4 fig 7 a d this was further supported by the xrd results the precipitation of sulphur could also be better explained by the product water and xrf results 3 6 surface area the surface area of hydroxide gypsum and limestone are shown in table 3 as shown in table 3 the obtained results revealed that the surface area of recovered hydroxides was the lowest followed by limestone and gypsum this is an indication that these materials can be used as additives to a number of metallurgical processes 3 7 thermal stability thermogravimetric analysis tga is a method used to determine the amount of weight loss in a material as a function of increasing temperature or isothermally as a function of time in an atmosphere of nitrogen helium air other gas or in vacuum 70 thermal stability of hydroxide gypsum and limestone are shown in fig 8 tga plots obtained from the hydroxide gypsum and limestone analyses are shown in fig 8 all chemical components showed some weight loss with an increase in temperature hydroxide and gypsum showed the same trends a sharp decrease in weight at 400 c is attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups from the mineral matrices and interlayers for limestone two stages of weight loss were observed there is one at 400 c which indicates a water loss and another one at 700 c which indicate the release of co2 during the thermal conversion of limestone to lime sdiri higashi hatta jamoussi and tase 71 reported that caco3 decompose at 740 990 c 3 8 ftir the recovered and synthesized fe species minerals were further investigated using ftir analysis as shown in fig 9 the functional groups for metals hydroxide gypsum and limestone are shown in tables 4 6 below the obtained results corroborate the xrd results which surfaced the presence of gypsum quartz and calcite for metals hydroxide table 4 the functional groups of recovered metals hydroxides are shown in table 4 the functional groups of synthesized gypsum are shown in table 5 as confirmed by xrd and ftir results the synthesized material was rich in sulphate quartz and hydroxyl group this is consistent to the xrd and xrf results the functional groups of recovered metals hydroxides are shown in table 6 as shown in table 6 the synthesized limestone was observed to be rich in carbonates quartz and hydroxyl ions this aligns very well to the xrd and xrf results it also confirms the major weight loss in tga results because oh group was escaping with an increase in temperature moreover the carbonate fraction was also escaping due to thermal activation leading to the formation of cao 4 techno economic evaluation this study will only focus on the operational expenditure for the treatment process table 7 shows the operational expenditure for the running of the proposed plant as shown in table 7 it can only cost r230 4 19 usd to produce a kilolitre kl of treated water and r806 40 66 usd to produce 3 5 kl of treated water using the proposed technology however from the resale of the recovered materials such as fe based minerals from the hydroxide reactor gypsum from the lime reactor and limestone from co2 reactor a net profit of r11263 60 933 usd may be recovered this indicates that the operators can spend r806 40 for treating 3 5 kl of amd and have a margin profit of r11263 60 933 usd from the selling of the recovered products 5 conclusion this study successfully proved that an integration of magnesite lime and co2 bubbling mlc process can be used to treat acid mine drainage amd and produce valuable products such as water suitable for discharge industrial applications and irrigation purposes was reclaimed valuable minerals that has commercial value and they includes fe hydroxides gypsum and limestone recovered and synthesized materials were of high purity 75 this was further confirmed by x ray diffraction xrf and ftir from icp ms the water results showed that the initial ph of amd was 2 5 and it increased to ph 10 and 12 after contacting magnesite and lime respectively post co2 bubbling the ph was reduced to 7 29 and approximately 99 and 95 of chemical species and sulphate were removed from an aqueous system respectively techno economic evaluation indicated that it can cost r806 40 66 usd to treat 3 5 kl of acid mine drainage and have a return of r11263 60 933 usd from the resale of the recovered materials from the findings of this study it can be concluded that this novel study will go a long way in curtailing the impact of amd by recovering and synthesizing valuable materials that have commercial value the recovery of valuable materials will aid in off setting the running costs of the treatment process through their resale hence making the technology self sustaining acknowledgement

8827,an industrial wastewater regeneration treatment was successfully designed taking advantage of the amorphous silica adsorption properties generated as an industrial waste in a geothermal power plant located in the city of mexicali baja california a tertiary wastewater process for the removal of heavy metals from a pre treated galvanic industry effluent was designed by using a suspension filtering system employing previously purified amorphous silica 99 40 by weight as an adsorbent of metal ions the use of the amorphous silica allows to eliminate monovalent and divalent metal ions 61 19 of silver 96 28 of cadmium and up to 98 of zinc copper nickel and lead present in a standard prepared sample solution and between 39 56 and 84 22 of nickel copper and zinc in a pre treated industrial sample achieving a good effluent quality with optimal chemical physical conditions for its use keywords amorphous silica adsorption agent water regeneration heavy metals geothermal central metal removal wastewater 1 introduction the current and projected demand for water resources is increasing due to growing urban industrial and environmental needs which is why it is necessary to search for solutions that allow the efficient decontamination of water for possible reuse in various activities 1 3 the reclamation of urban and industrial wastewater is based on finding a proper integration of methods 4 5 materials and technologies to achieve a joint and positive incremental effect of water quality by the elimination of pollutants 6 7 the application of reclaimed wastewater is very broad field that is influenced by not only on the technology used 8 9 but also on the differences in initial and final water quality while during its treatment balancing at all times to have the greatest effectiveness and efficiency in terms of resources energy operating costs and installation and use of space 10 on the other hand the wastewater reclamation process design depends in the pollutant physicochemical properties toxicity persistence the amount of it the matrix complexity and volume of water that we want to regenerate 11 is important to mention that the industries activities generate pollutants as unwanted byproducts the range of such pollutants is wide ranging and they involve both organic and inorganic pollutants as pathogenic microbes nutrients substances that consume oxygen from water heavy metals and persistent organic matter as well as suspended solids and pesticides which in some cases come from diffuse sources not localized 12 13 the most common pollutants that we find in industry process wastewater are heavy metals cations zinc lead cadmium nickel silver and chromium 14 these elements are considered very dangerous because they enter to the food chain through biogeochemical cycles and are usually accumulate in the muscle and fatty tissues 15 16 heavy metals are highly harmful hazardous and persistent in other words they require long periods of time to degrade into less harmful compounds 17 also they can travel long distances by air water and soil because of this it is very hard to evaluate their environmental impact and also is not easy to track their pollution origin 18 some of the most studied and common techniques for the heavy metal removal from water and wastewater are the adsorption and the absorption of cations in solids surfaces 19 using solids with high porosity small diameters and high cation exchange capacity as clay zeolites activated charcoal or silica gel 20 21 one of the most studied adsorption agents is the amorphous silica for example the patent us4349513 describes a process which comprises capturing the uranium and or thorium from an industrial liquid by an amorphous silica precipitate formed by adding water glass to the liquid recovering the captured metals by acid treatment 22 unlike the mentioned patent in this study an industrial waste was selected as a re generable adsorption agent material for the removal of heavy metals found in sewage the amorphous silica is a non desired secondary product in the cerro prieto geothermal power plant located in the city of mexicali baja california 23 24 the silica is the main component of a solid that is deposited on the different pipelines those that transport the water from the interior of the earth s crust to the surface and those that carry the condensed brine to the evaporation ponds at an average temperature of 100 c 25 26 this paper focuses on taking advantage of the amorphous silica adsorption properties for the study of the most favorable factors in standard prepare samples to approach simultaneous removal of different heavy metal ions as zinc lead cadmium nickel copper silver and chromium from actual pre treated industrial effluents to the author s knowledge there is no previous experience in the usage of an industrial waste generated in a geothermal power plant as adsorption agent and only a previous work has been found related to the integration of amorphous silica although applied to the removal of uranium and thorium during the treatment of industrial wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 analytical techniques most of the analytical techniques used in this study are based on the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 22th edition which is a joint publication of the american public health association apha the american water works association awwa and the water environment federation wef 27 turbidity was measured using a ltc3000w la motte turbidimeter according to the 2130 b turbidity nephelometric method in the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater total chromium copper silver lead zinc nickel and cadmium were measured using the atomic absorption spectroscopy by flame method thermo elemental solar s4 according to the standard methods of wastewater 3030e 3131 b to evaluate the total metal concentration samples were diluted to 2 v v using nitric acid 2 0 normal to ensure total solubility of the metals methods 2540 d total suspended solid dried at 103 105 c and 2540 c total dissolved solids dried at 180 c from the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 22th edition were used to analyze both suspended solids and dissolved solids dissolved silica was measured using a hach spectrophotometer dr 2000 according to the 4500 sio2 d heteropoly blue method procedure of the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater both ph and conductivity of samples were measured by the potentiometric 4500 h b electrometric method and the 2510 b method of the standard methods of wastewater using an orion star plus thermo scientific potentiometer the amorphous silica morphological analysis was made by using scanning electron microscopy jeol jsm 7600f equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds and an ultra thin window utw detector to examine the microstructure the crystalline phase was characterized by using a x ray diffraction analyzer xrd bruker 08 advance with cu kα radiation 2 2 experimental setup the metal ion removal test was carried out in a bench scale single compartment filtration suspension reactor equipped with a 4 l polyethylene mixing tank suspension of 5 g of amorphous silica per batch see fig 1 a a coupled with a stirrer plate corning 6795 220 stirring hot plate an electric power head pump aqueon quietflow aq2300 see fig 1 b and also a glass soxhlet extractor device usually used for oil and grease analysis as a filter support each packet filter with 5 g of amorphous silica using 1 per batch see fig 1 c 2 3 experimental procedure amorphous silica was sampled from the cerro prieto geothermal power plant located in the city of mexicali baja california it was prepared and purified with an acid digestion extraction by using 2 ml of nitric acid di water 1 1 per gram of silica stirring and heating at 95 5 c for 2 h cooling down to 20 c and washing vigorously with di water two liter size standard prepared samples with concentrations between 2 and 5 ppm of chromium copper silver lead zinc nickel and cadmium were located in the adsorption reactor the ph conductivity and metals concentration were measured before adding 5 g of amorphous silica to the reactor stirring the sample was necessary to create a homogenous suspension another 5 g of the adsorbent material were located the amorphous silica was wrapped in a 10 µm cellulose filter in the filter support a glass soxhlet extractor device each depuration test of standard prepared and wastewater samples was carried out for 2 h of recirculation through the filtration suspension system under standard conditions of temperature and pressure the use of any preservation method acids was discarded in order to purely assess the efficiency of the technology studied the average chemical composition of the samples is shown in the tables 1 and 2 operation conditions of every experiment are clearly described in the r d section 3 results and discussion an electron microscopy scan of a silica waste sample from the geothermic plant is shown in the fig 2a the microstructures are mainly composed of silica sio2 particles and sodium chloride nacl the fig 2b shows the x ray diffraction xrd pattern of the ceramic waste amorphous silica was identified plus two additional soluble phases in which ones the sodium chloride is the principal phase identified by sem and also potassium chloride is shown in a much lower intensity meanwhile in the fig 2c the x ray diffraction xrd of the purified silica is shown the analysis shows a salts free material the most favorable parameters for the metals removal were determined in a very simple matrix standard prepared samples where the suspended solids interferences between the amorphous silica and the metals were minimal in other words the pollutant adsorption agent interaction was arranged to be maximum in the table 3 are shown several variables tested as ph values the adsorption method and the amount of amorphous silica used in each one of the experiments in order to identify which parameters are the most favorable in the heavy metals removal meanwhile the summary of results in parts per million mg l for each one of the experiments according with the variation of factors is shown in the table 4 the intention of the first three experiments was to demonstrate the importance of ph in the efficiency of the treatment since in the k1 experiment the ph was very low the solubility of the metals is very high and the removal of the metals was less than 5 whereas when the ph was very high about 11 the elimination of the metals was due to the precipitation of the metal hydroxides and not due to the action of the amorphous silica according to the data shown in table 4 the best results of these three experiments were obtained when the ph was adjusted to 6 5 the experiments k 4 and k 5 showed that the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment is proportional to the amount of amorphous silica used as well as it shows that the comparison between filtration and suspension as adsorption methods according with the experiment 7 data on table 4 the filtration suspension adsorption method allowed to eliminate around 85 95 of the heavy metals from the laboratory prepared samples except for silver which was only removed in 61 whereby this procedure was the most effective for the elimination of contaminants a clear view of the correlation between the concentration of the cations in parts per million mg l and the operation time min is shown in the fig 3 a g the comparison between charts shows that the adjustment of the variables that favored in greater proportion the elimination of metallic particles were a ph value of 6 5 for the operation procedure a time of exposure to the treatment of 30 min at room temperature and the use of an adsorption method based in the amorphous silica suspension and filtration the treatment scope compression lies in the processing of data that relate the variation of the removal of metal ions with respect to the treatment time in each of the experiments cited in table 4 this data was plotted with linear magnitudes fig 3 allowing to appreciate in a clear and simple way the treatment removal tendency of each experimentation however a logarithmic representation of all the data facilitates the determination of a theoretical constant of the metals removal per time unit this allows an appropriate interpretation and comparison of the results using all the data presented in the table 4 an exponential equation was calculated for each one of the experiments described in the table 3 such as the one described below y n e k x where y pollutant concentration in logarithmic scale metals in the sample n metallic initial concentration cut in abscissas k efficiency constant potentials of removal capacity p m being the removal of metals in the sample in time x experiment time minutes being a negative value indicates the removal of a specific metal and a positive k value means there wasn t a metal elimination from the aqueous matrix the table 5 shows all of the potentials of removal capacity p m considering each of the variables stipulated during the experimental tests the value shown in the table 5 for the zinc removal potential in the experiment 5 conditions ph 6 53 using 10 1807 g of amorphous silica at temperature 25 c with suspension as adsorption method is 3 42 10 3 which means that 0 00342 mg of zinc were eliminated from the wastewater sample artificially prepared for each minute of treatment therefore the comparison between the pollutant removal potentials for each one of the experiments is a tool that makes it easier to appreciate which of the selected variables make the treatment a more effective system the sorption capacity of the amorphous silica in each one of the experiments using laboratory prepared samples is shown in the table 6 this information allows to calculate how many grams of amorphous silica are necessary to remove a specific amount of heavy metals for example for a sample with a concentration of 1 2 mg per liter of nickel it would be necessary to use 10 g of amorphous silica to achieve its total removal under the conditions used in experiment number 7 conditions ph 6 56 at temperature 25 c with silica filtration and suspension as adsorption method based on the experimental data presented in the tables 3 6 the best removal effectiveness was achieved in the experiment 7 by using 10 g of amorphous silica 5 g of amorphous silica in a homogenous suspension and another 5 g of the adsorbent material wrapped in a filter at a neutral ph and a temperature of 25 c for 30 min once determined the most favorable variables for the metal removal in standard prepared samples it was important to test the wastewater treatment system in a real matrix sample for that reason a pre treated wastewater its composition is shown in the table 2 sample was taken from a galvanic industry by using the metal removal treatment setup described in the section 2 3 the silica treatment was capable to eliminate 84 22 of zinc 39 53 of nickel and 47 93 of copper the results obtained are shown in the chart 8 fig 4 4 conclusions the regeneration of urban and industrial wastewater is based on finding the proper integration of methods materials and technologies that achieve a joint and positive effect in the increment of the water quality by the elimination of pollutants a highly feasible solution was tested by using as an adsorption agent an industrial waste coming from the geothermal process of the cerro prieto plant in mexicali bc which does not really have any application and goes directly to confinement in the evaporation ponds there is no previous experience in the usage of an industrial waste generated in a geothermal power plant as adsorption agent through the purification of this material a profitable option can be constituted for the treatment of industrial wastewater with the purpose of diminishing economically effectively the concentration of heavy metals the use of the amorphous silica allowed to eliminate monovalent and divalent metal ions for laboratory prepared samples the percentages of heavy metals removed were 60 of silver 96 of cadmium and up to 98 of zinc copper nickel and lead for industrial matrices the proposed adsorption method was capable to eliminate around 40 80 of heavy metals as zinc nickel and copper the quality of the obtained water represents an economic and environmental advantage

analytical techniques most of the analytical techniques used in this study are based on the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 22th edition which is a joint publication of the american public health association apha the american water works association awwa and the water environment federation wef 27 turbidity was measured using a ltc3000w la motte turbidimeter according to the 2130 b turbidity nephelometric method in the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater total chromium copper silver lead zinc nickel and cadmium were measured using the atomic absorption spectroscopy by flame method thermo elemental solar s4 according to the standard methods of wastewater 3030e 3131 b to evaluate the total metal concentration samples were diluted to 2 v v using nitric acid 2 0 normal to ensure total solubility of the metals methods 2540 d total suspended solid dried at 103 105 c and 2540 c total dissolved solids dried at 180 c from the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 22th edition were used to analyze both suspended solids and dissolved solids dissolved silica was measured using a hach spectrophotometer dr 2000 according to the 4500 sio2 d heteropoly blue method procedure of the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater both ph and conductivity of samples were measured by the potentiometric 4500 h b electrometric method and the 2510 b method of the standard methods of wastewater using an orion star plus thermo scientific potentiometer the amorphous silica morphological analysis was made by using scanning electron microscopy jeol jsm 7600f equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds and an ultra thin window utw detector to examine the microstructure the crystalline phase was characterized by using a x ray diffraction analyzer xrd bruker 08 advance with cu kα radiation 2 2 experimental setup the metal ion removal test was carried out in a bench scale single compartment filtration suspension reactor equipped with a 4 l polyethylene mixing tank suspension of 5 g of amorphous silica per batch see fig 1 a a coupled with a stirrer plate corning 6795 220 stirring hot plate an electric power head pump aqueon quietflow aq2300 see fig 1 b and also a glass soxhlet extractor device usually used for oil and grease analysis as a filter support each packet filter with 5 g of amorphous silica using 1 per batch see fig 1 c 2 3 experimental procedure amorphous silica was sampled from the cerro prieto geothermal power plant located in the city of mexicali baja california it was prepared and purified with an acid digestion extraction by using 2 ml of nitric acid di water 1 1 per gram of silica stirring and heating at 95 5 c for 2 h cooling down to 20 c and washing vigorously with di water two liter size standard prepared samples with concentrations between 2 and 5 ppm of chromium copper silver lead zinc nickel and cadmium were located in the adsorption reactor the ph conductivity and metals concentration were measured before adding 5 g of amorphous silica to the reactor stirring the sample was necessary to create a homogenous suspension another 5 g of the adsorbent material were located the amorphous silica was wrapped in a 10 µm cellulose filter in the filter support a glass soxhlet extractor device each depuration test of standard prepared and wastewater samples was carried out for 2 h of recirculation through the filtration suspension system under standard conditions of temperature and pressure the use of any preservation method acids was discarded in order to purely assess the efficiency of the technology studied the average chemical composition of the samples is shown in the tables 1 and 2 operation conditions of every experiment are clearly described in the r d section 3 results and discussion an electron microscopy scan of a silica waste sample from the geothermic plant is shown in the fig 2a the microstructures are mainly composed of silica sio2 particles and sodium chloride nacl the fig 2b shows the x ray diffraction xrd pattern of the ceramic waste amorphous silica was identified plus two additional soluble phases in which ones the sodium chloride is the principal phase identified by sem and also potassium chloride is shown in a much lower intensity meanwhile in the fig 2c the x ray diffraction xrd of the purified silica is shown the analysis shows a salts free material the most favorable parameters for the metals removal were determined in a very simple matrix standard prepared samples where the suspended solids interferences between the amorphous silica and the metals were minimal in other words the pollutant adsorption agent interaction was arranged to be maximum in the table 3 are shown several variables tested as ph values the adsorption method and the amount of amorphous silica used in each one of the experiments in order to identify which parameters are the most favorable in the heavy metals removal meanwhile the summary of results in parts per million mg l for each one of the experiments according with the variation of factors is shown in the table 4 the intention of the first three experiments was to demonstrate the importance of ph in the efficiency of the treatment since in the k1 experiment the ph was very low the solubility of the metals is very high and the removal of the metals was less than 5 whereas when the ph was very high about 11 the elimination of the metals was due to the precipitation of the metal hydroxides and not due to the action of the amorphous silica according to the data shown in table 4 the best results of these three experiments were obtained when the ph was adjusted to 6 5 the experiments k 4 and k 5 showed that the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment is proportional to the amount of amorphous silica used as well as it shows that the comparison between filtration and suspension as adsorption methods according with the experiment 7 data on table 4 the filtration suspension adsorption method allowed to eliminate around 85 95 of the heavy metals from the laboratory prepared samples except for silver which was only removed in 61 whereby this procedure was the most effective for the elimination of contaminants a clear view of the correlation between the concentration of the cations in parts per million mg l and the operation time min is shown in the fig 3 a g the comparison between charts shows that the adjustment of the variables that favored in greater proportion the elimination of metallic particles were a ph value of 6 5 for the operation procedure a time of exposure to the treatment of 30 min at room temperature and the use of an adsorption method based in the amorphous silica suspension and filtration the treatment scope compression lies in the processing of data that relate the variation of the removal of metal ions with respect to the treatment time in each of the experiments cited in table 4 this data was plotted with linear magnitudes fig 3 allowing to appreciate in a clear and simple way the treatment removal tendency of each experimentation however a logarithmic representation of all the data facilitates the determination of a theoretical constant of the metals removal per time unit this allows an appropriate interpretation and comparison of the results using all the data presented in the table 4 an exponential equation was calculated for each one of the experiments described in the table 3 such as the one described below y n e k x where y pollutant concentration in logarithmic scale metals in the sample n metallic initial concentration cut in abscissas k efficiency constant potentials of removal capacity p m being the removal of metals in the sample in time x experiment time minutes being a negative value indicates the removal of a specific metal and a positive k value means there wasn t a metal elimination from the aqueous matrix the table 5 shows all of the potentials of removal capacity p m considering each of the variables stipulated during the experimental tests the value shown in the table 5 for the zinc removal potential in the experiment 5 conditions ph 6 53 using 10 1807 g of amorphous silica at temperature 25 c with suspension as adsorption method is 3 42 10 3 which means that 0 00342 mg of zinc were eliminated from the wastewater sample artificially prepared for each minute of treatment therefore the comparison between the pollutant removal potentials for each one of the experiments is a tool that makes it easier to appreciate which of the selected variables make the treatment a more effective system the sorption capacity of the amorphous silica in each one of the experiments using laboratory prepared samples is shown in the table 6 this information allows to calculate how many grams of amorphous silica are necessary to remove a specific amount of heavy metals for example for a sample with a concentration of 1 2 mg per liter of nickel it would be necessary to use 10 g of amorphous silica to achieve its total removal under the conditions used in experiment number 7 conditions ph 6 56 at temperature 25 c with silica filtration and suspension as adsorption method based on the experimental data presented in the tables 3 6 the best removal effectiveness was achieved in the experiment 7 by using 10 g of amorphous silica 5 g of amorphous silica in a homogenous suspension and another 5 g of the adsorbent material wrapped in a filter at a neutral ph and a temperature of 25 c for 30 min once determined the most favorable variables for the metal removal in standard prepared samples it was important to test the wastewater treatment system in a real matrix sample for that reason a pre treated wastewater its composition is shown in the table 2 sample was taken from a galvanic industry by using the metal removal treatment setup described in the section 2 3 the silica treatment was capable to eliminate 84 22 of zinc 39 53 of nickel and 47 93 of copper the results obtained are shown in the chart 8 fig 4 4 conclusions the regeneration of urban and industrial wastewater is based on finding the proper integration of methods materials and technologies that achieve a joint and positive effect in the increment of the water quality by the elimination of pollutants a highly feasible solution was tested by using as an adsorption agent an industrial waste coming from the geothermal process of the cerro prieto plant in mexicali bc which does not really have any application and goes directly to confinement in the evaporation ponds there is no previous experience in the usage of an industrial waste generated in a geothermal power plant as adsorption agent through the purification of this material a profitable option can be constituted for the treatment of industrial wastewater with the purpose of diminishing economically effectively the concentration of heavy metals the use of the amorphous silica allowed to eliminate monovalent and divalent metal ions for laboratory prepared samples the percentages of heavy metals removed were 60 of silver 96 of cadmium and up to 98 of zinc copper nickel and lead for industrial matrices the proposed adsorption method was capable to eliminate around 40 80 of heavy metals as zinc nickel and copper the quality of the obtained water represents an economic and environmental advantage

purification processes if the input power is supplied from clean energy sources e g solar wind tidal geothermal awh will be a renewable and sustainable water resource since i atmospheric humidity is renewed naturally through evaporation from the ocean and ii awh process does not generate any side effect or by products harmful to the environment there are several studies in the literature focusing on the process and functionality of awh systems for water harvesting 6 9 however most of these studies have praised the viability of the process especially near tropical and coastal areas where temperature and humidity levels are typically high 10 13 one of the first works dealing with water harvesting from atmosphere was published in 1947 14 an apparatus was invented that consisted of a system of vertical and inclined channels underground to collect water from atmosphere by cooling moist air to a temperature below its dew point gad et al 15 reported water harvesting using a liquid

condensation on cooling surfaces ii sorption using desiccant materials and iii gas separation using membranes they modeled built and tested a solar assisted sorption dehumidifier that was added to an air cooled heat exchanger to dehumidify air for reducing the energy consumption of an air conditioning system it was shown that their system could be used for awh to deliver 5 2 liters of water per

weather scenarios in three mediterranean countries jordan lebanon and morocco they discussed the possibility of using solar power to run absorption chillers as the source of cooling for water

determined cabanatuan in philippines with average mhi of 0 59 as the most suitable location for awh among the considered locations they also concluded that mhi 0 3 represented unfavorable conditions for awh lekouch et al 18 focused on natural dew and fog collection from atmosphere in an arid region of southwest morocco the dew water was collected using standard passive dew condensers and fog water was collected utilizing planar fog collectors they also simulated the dew yield and reported potentials of 0 3 18 1 liter per m2 of collection surface from may to october in total for 15 moroccan cities sharan et al 8 also studied dew yield from conventional uninsulated corrugated galvanized iron in northwest rural india they estimated that for common large roofs 100 300 m2 in northwest india region dew water could provide 600 1800 l during the dry season late september to early may when needed most by the population bergmair et al 9 analyzed a membrane facilitated awh using a mathematical model they showed that in warm and humid areas using a selective membrane to concentrate the water vapor before cooling and condensation would significantly decrease the energy consumption of awh systems based on their obtained indexes between 40 and 68 saving in energy consumption per unit volume of water harvested would be achieved our comprehensive literature review indicates that realistic performance evaluation of awh has not been studied independently and the pertinent literature lacks the followings performance of commercially available awh in different climates a standard and or procedure for performance evaluation of awh a general and in depth understanding of functionality and limitations of awh technology the present study aims to develop a systematic experimental procedure for evaluating the performance of awh systems we tested a few commercially available residential size awh in our lab under a variety of climatic conditions using

a new testing procedure is developed and introduced in this study several relevant specifications and guidelines for performance rating of heat pumps are adopted from ansi ahri standard 210 240 19 ashrae standard 16 2016 20 and ansi ashrae standard 128 2011 21 for each test measurements are performed for 5 h after achieving steady state conditions all the tests are repeated 3 times to ensure reproducibility of the acquired data 4 results and discussion the main goal of this study is to investigate the performance and limitations of commercially available awh systems under various climatic conditions as such three residential size awh with rated water generation capacity of 30 l day and 1500 w nominal power manufactured in the united states canada and china are purchased and tested using the custom built test bed per the testing procedure described in section 3 the tests are performed in a research laboratory at simon fraser university the temperature and relative humidity rh of air entering the awh units are set in the environmental chamber in the ranges of 0 45 c and 10 100 respectively fig 3 shows a sample of temperature and rh measured at intake and exhaust of an awh during the tests it should be noted that the cold air stream after the dehumidification coil in most existing awh passes through the condenser coil to improve the coefficient of performance cop of the condensing unit as such the temperature of air stream at the discharge of tested awhs is larger than the intake temperature tables 1 3 represent the results of tests under different climatic conditions these conditions are assumed based on average monthly data for different cities in north america that can be expanded to similar climates in the world for example typical weather conditions in florida u s in summer and spring are considered as representatives of warm and humid and mild and humid climates respectively 22 a typical weather condition of british columbia canada in winter is used for cold and humid arizona u s in summer for warm and dry colorado u s in summer and spring for mild and dry and cold and dry respectively and california u s in spring for mild climate form the conditions of tests 23 an uncertainty analysis of the measured data shows an accuracy of 0 01 kg h for water generation and 0 03 kwh for energy consumption respectively based on the obtained results average numbers from the tested systems are used to conclude the behavior of awh systems analyzing the variation of water harvesting and energy consumption rates shows that neither temperature nor relative humidity is alone a dominating parameter in formulating the behavior of awhs however the water content ω or dew point temperature tdewpoint plays a significant role as such in figs 4 and 5 the average water harvesting rate and energy consumption of the tested awhs are plotted versus water content ω and tdewpoint the plots represent two cases each a real condition that shows the average measured values through experimentation of awh samples and an ideal condition that is calculated based on thermodynamics and psychrometric rules for the ideal case it is assumed that an ideal machine can harvest all the extractable water from ambient air without frost formation on its dehumidification coil as such it is assumed that an ideal machine is designed and executed in a controlled way that cools the air stream down to a point close to but above freezing temperature 1 c the concept of an ideal awh machine and its performance characteristics can provide an evaluation criterion and give a better insight for optimal design and advancement of the current technology in future as expected these plots show that i water harvesting rate increases at higher water content and ii the energy consumption per liter of harvested water decreases as ω or tdewpoint increases however the behavior of variations is not accurately predictable and the trend of real data points is not smooth unlike the ideal results this inconsistency is due to the effect of another factor on the water generation rate and the energy consumption which is the dry bulb temperature in fact the amount of energy consumed by awh to extract a liter of water splits into the sensible cooling of air down to tdewpoint and below it and the latent heat of condensation therefore for a same ω or tdewpoint air at a higher temperature requires higher power for water harvesting due to its higher sensible cooling load consequently at higher temperatures the rate of water harvesting will decrease and the energy consumption per liter of water will increase the water harvesting plots in figs 4 and 5 also show that the gap between the ideal and real data points increases by increasing the ω or tdewpoint which shows the importance of optimal design and functionality of awh in high humidity water content areas on the other side the relatively small difference between the real and ideal water harvesting rates at low humidity areas can be interpreted that the existing awh technology is not appropriate in such climates and there is no remarkable potential of modifications to enhance the performance of awh units fig 6 qualitatively represents the simultaneous effect of temperature and humidity content on water harvesting rate versus t ω and tdewpoint where higher rates are depicted with larger size bubbles as expected the higher water harvesting rates or the lowest rate of energy consumption per liter appears in areas with a simultaneous low t and high ω or tdewpoint the psychrometric chart has a limiting line rh 100 demarcated by a dashed line in fig 6 that confines the maximum yield in water harvesting rate as such the highest water harvesting rate is obtained in climates that are closer to the rh 100 line and have higher ω or tdewpoint noteworthy is another limitation that exists due to frost formation on the dehumidifier evaporator coil in low temperature and humidity climates based on our experiments awh systems do not operate in low temperature and humidity climates i e cold and dry condition t 6 c and rh 75 tdewpoint 2 c and these conditions are also marked on fig 6 the cost of water generation increases as t increases or ω consequently tdewpoint decreases 5 conclusions this paper presented a critical performance investigation of commercially available awh systems a new testbed was built that featured environmental chambers to mimic realistic operating conditions of different climates a new testing procedure was introduced for assessing the performance of awh systems following relevant ashrae and ansi ahri standards three residential size awh units nominal power of 1500 w or less were systematically tested in our lab under a variety of conditions including warm and humid mild and humid cold and humid warm and dry mild and dry cold and dry and mild climates the results showed that the water harvesting yield enhances by simultaneous increase of water content ω or dewpoint temperature tdewpoint and a decrease of temperature the average water harvesting rate varied in a range of 0 05 l h for cold and humid to 0 65 l h for warm and humid climates the average energy consumption changed from 1 02 kwh l for warm and humid to 6 23 kwh l for cold and humid climates in addition an ideal awh unit was defined as a machine capable of cooling the air stream down to a point close to but above the freezing temperature 1 c to achieve the highest water harvesting rate at all climates the comparisons showed an increase in the gaps between real and ideal water harvesting rates by changing from low humidity water content condition to high humidity condition it denoted a higher potential of performance improvement in higher humidity areas through optimal design of awh systems for those climates the results also showed that i the considered awh units failed to operate in cold and dry climate and ii the energy cost of awh increased significantly in hot and dry conditions a criterion tdewpoint 2 c was established based on our experiment as a minimum climatic requirement for using awh systems acknowledgements this work was supported by automotive

condensing unit as such the temperature of air stream at the discharge of tested awhs is larger than the intake temperature tables 1 3 represent the results of tests under different climatic conditions these conditions are assumed based on average monthly data for different cities in north america that can be expanded to similar climates in the world for example typical weather conditions in florida u s in summer and spring are considered as representatives of warm and humid and mild and humid climates respectively 22 a typical weather condition of british columbia canada in winter is used for cold and humid arizona u s in summer for warm and dry colorado u s in summer and spring for mild and dry and cold and dry respectively and california u s in spring for mild climate form the conditions of tests 23 an uncertainty analysis of the measured data shows an accuracy of 0 01 kg h for water generation and 0 03 kwh for energy consumption respectively based on the obtained results average numbers from the tested systems are used to conclude the behavior of awh systems analyzing the variation of water harvesting and energy consumption rates shows that neither temperature nor relative humidity is alone a dominating parameter in formulating the behavior of awhs however the water content ω or dew point temperature tdewpoint plays a significant role as such in figs 4 and 5 the average water harvesting rate and energy consumption of the tested awhs are plotted versus water content ω and tdewpoint the plots represent two cases each a real condition that shows the average measured values through experimentation of awh samples and an ideal condition that is calculated based on thermodynamics and psychrometric rules for the ideal case it is assumed that an ideal machine can harvest all the extractable water from ambient air without frost formation on its dehumidification coil as such it is assumed that an ideal machine is designed and executed in a controlled way that cools the air stream down to a point close to but above freezing temperature 1 c the concept of an ideal awh machine and its performance characteristics can provide an evaluation criterion and give a better insight for optimal design and advancement of the current technology in future as expected these plots show that i water harvesting rate increases at higher water content and ii the energy consumption per liter of harvested water decreases as ω or tdewpoint increases however the behavior of variations is not accurately predictable and the trend of real data points is not smooth unlike the ideal results this inconsistency is due to the effect of another factor on the water generation rate and the energy consumption which is the dry bulb temperature in fact the amount of energy consumed by awh to extract a liter of water splits into the sensible cooling of air down to tdewpoint and below it and the latent heat of condensation therefore for a same ω or tdewpoint air at a higher temperature requires higher power for water harvesting due to its higher sensible cooling load consequently at higher temperatures the rate of water harvesting will decrease and the energy consumption per liter of water will increase the water harvesting plots in figs 4 and 5 also show that the gap between the ideal and real data points increases by increasing the ω or tdewpoint which shows the importance of optimal design and functionality of awh in high humidity water content areas on the other side the relatively small difference between the real and ideal water harvesting rates at low humidity areas can be interpreted that the existing awh technology is not appropriate in such climates and there is no remarkable potential of modifications to enhance the performance of awh units fig 6 qualitatively represents the simultaneous effect of temperature and humidity content on water harvesting rate versus t ω and tdewpoint where higher rates are depicted with larger size bubbles as expected the higher water harvesting rates or the lowest rate of energy consumption per liter appears in areas with a simultaneous low t and high ω or tdewpoint the psychrometric chart has a limiting line rh 100 demarcated by a dashed line in fig 6 that confines the maximum yield in water harvesting rate as such the highest water harvesting rate is obtained in climates that are closer to the rh 100 line and have higher ω or tdewpoint noteworthy is another limitation that exists due to frost formation on the dehumidifier evaporator coil in low temperature and humidity climates based on our experiments awh systems do not operate in low temperature and humidity climates i e cold and dry condition t 6 c and rh 75 tdewpoint 2 c and these conditions are also marked on fig 6 the cost of water generation increases as t increases or ω consequently tdewpoint decreases 5 conclusions this paper presented a critical performance investigation of commercially available awh systems a new testbed was built that featured environmental chambers to mimic realistic operating conditions of different climates a new testing procedure was introduced for assessing the performance of awh systems following relevant ashrae and ansi ahri standards three residential size awh units nominal power of 1500 w or less were systematically tested in our lab under a variety of conditions including warm and humid mild and humid cold and humid warm and dry mild and dry cold and dry and mild climates the results showed that the water harvesting yield enhances by simultaneous increase of water content ω or dewpoint temperature tdewpoint and a decrease of temperature the average water harvesting rate varied in a range of 0 05 l h for cold and humid to 0 65 l h for warm and humid climates the average energy consumption changed from 1 02 kwh l for warm and humid to 6 23 kwh l for cold and humid climates in addition an ideal awh unit was defined as a machine capable of cooling the air stream down to a point close to but above the freezing temperature 1 c to achieve the highest water harvesting rate at all climates the comparisons showed an increase in the gaps between real and ideal water harvesting rates by changing from low humidity water content condition to high humidity condition it denoted a higher potential of performance improvement in higher humidity areas through optimal design of awh systems for those climates the results also showed that i the considered awh units failed to operate in cold and dry climate and ii the energy cost of awh increased significantly in hot and dry conditions a criterion tdewpoint 2 c was established based on our experiment as a minimum climatic requirement for using awh systems acknowledgements this work was supported by automotive

production 3 2 1 branch elongation the data presented in table 3 revealed that the branch elongation of the two varieties varied considerably under the influence of water source that the longer branch is registered in plants irrigated with tw in another side chemlali tww irrigated olives had branches longer than branches of chetoui tww irrigated olives with an average of 16 19 cm 3 2 2 leaf area the data presented in table 3 revealed a significant variability in chetoui plants in terms of leaf area under the influence of the two water treatments tw and tww leaf area of chetoui plants receiving tw was higher compared to those receiving tww 2 35 cm2 it can be observed in the same figure that it was a significant increase of leaf area in chemlali plants irrigated with tww as compared to those irrigated with tw statistically the two varieties chetoui and chemlali showed the same response to the tw treatment but results indicated that compared with chetoui plants chemlali plants presented significantly the highest leaf area as response to tww treatment 3 2 3 flowering parameters flowering parameters showed a water source dependence p 0 05 increases in these parameters were observed in the two studied cultivars passing from tw to tww treatment table 4 3 3 plant physiological analysis 3 3 1 dry leaves weight concerning dry leaves weight table 5 it is evident that the two varieties did not follow the same trend in chetoui variety this parameter was not significantly influenced by the two types of irrigation water but the chemlali plants irrigated with tww showed a significant higher dry leaves weight compared with the others irrigated with tw also the tww treatment enhances significantly chetoui more than chemlali dry leaves weight 3 3 2 dry roots weight the results obtained in table 5 indicate that chetoui and chemlali samples irrigated with tww showed a significant enhancement of dry roots weight compared with the tw irrigated chetoui and chemlali plants reaching values of 44 21 and 42 55 g respectively contrary to tw tww increases significantly chetoui more than chemlali dry roots weight 3 3 3 chlorophylls and carotenoids contents determination chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and total chlorophylls contents of olive leaves are showed in table 5 the chlorophyll a amount of chetoui samples seems to vary with treatment indeed tww irrigated plants had significantly p 0 05 the highest content 223 98 mg kg moreover we observed that there are no significant differences between irrigation treatments for chlorophyll a content in leaves chemlali cultivar tww treatment didn t vary significantly chlorophyll a values between chetoui and chemlali samples chetoui plants receiving tww had less chlorophyll b content than others irrigated with tw but in chemlali olives this value didn t varied remarkably passing from a treatment to another statistically chemlali cultivar showed the highest amounts in response to tw and tww compared with chetoui cultivar the total chlorophylls contents of olive leaves are presented in table 5 these results indicate that leaves of chetoui receiving tw registered significantly a higher content than those receiving tww the quantification of total chlorophylls in chemlali leaves showed that plants irrigated with tw also had the highest content compared with plants irrigated with tww and amounted to the value of 648 82 mg kg in response to tww chemlali plants marked significantly high total chlorophylls content compared to chetoui olives but the same results were obtained in response to tw the two tested varieties showed a no significant variation between the tap water and the treated wastewater treatments in carotenoids leaves content table 5 statistically the highest carotenoids content was observed in chetoui simples in response to tw and tww treatments compared to chemlali plants with values of 175 78 mg kg and 173 54 mg kg respectively 3 3 4 changes in polyphenols content of olive leaf and root extracts following irrigation with tw and tww the data presented in table 5 indicates that leaf polyphenols l polyphenols in tw irrigated chetoui and tw irrigated chemlali registered the highest contents chetoui cultivar was characterized by the significant highest l polyphenols content in response to tw and tww compared with chemlali cultivar root polyphenols r polyphenols were quantified after each treatment and results were shown in table 5 significant differences p 0 05 were encountered for the root chetoui and chemlali polyphenols between the two treatments these two varieties registered the highest contents in response to tww irrigation 9586 99 and 5674 19 mg kg respectively after irrigation with tw or with tww the greater value of r polyphenols was obtained by chetoui samples 4 discussion tunisia suffers a very severe fresh water shortage as other arab countries the reuse of the non conventional water seems to be a reliable solution in the present work the evaluation of water type tested on olive morphology indicated that it was no positive effect of tww on chetoui branch elongation leaf area and dry leaves weight these results indicate a high correlation between growth parameters which may results from the anatomical relationship between different olive tree parts characterizing olive species 20 on the another hand this data is in accordance with results obtained by trad et al 28 who reported that dry leaves weight of chetoui cultivar was not significantly influenced by the irrigation with tww and this parameter is independent of irrigation water source leaf area in chemlali cultivar irrigated with tww increases compared with those receiving tw the results obtained confirm the finding of charfi et al 11 who indicated that leaf area of olives irrigated with treated wastewater was higher than those of the control thus the enhancement of leaf area and dry leaves weight can be explained by the tww wealth containing a significant quantity of nutrients as well as essential elements n p k compared to tw 16 our data indicates that the flowering was better when chetoui and chemlali plants are irrigated with tww compared with those receiving tw this result may be correlated with the height nutritive value of this water the decreasing of branch elongation under tww treatment and the increasing of flowering parameters may have resulted from competition for assimilates between branch elongation and fructification our results are in accordance with data obtained by masmoudi charfi and ben mechlia 20 indicating that in chetoui cultivar development of olives from flowering to harvest may affect branch elongation in chemlali variety the positive effect of wastewater on production parameters has been also reported by bedbabis et al 8 it was reflected by a significant yield increasing therefore this water was considered as fertigation stimulator this data is not in line with results obtained by alghobar et al 2 in fact they founded that irrigation with sewage treated wastewater didn t improve production characters of rice crop under this industrial treated wastewater usage a significant increase was seen in dry roots weight of chetoui and chemlali samples table 5 over that of the control tw this increase in chemlali plants explains the highest root density reaching a value of 0 27 fig 1 this root density may provide an excellent detection of nutrients especially immobile accumulated near the soil surface in another side many investigators have reported a substantial increase in biomass production upon recycled effluent application on several species 32 as well as on olive 11 this finding may not be observed in chetoui olives witch the enhancement of dry roots weight can be explained by pedo climatic stresses since this cultivar is widespread in the north of tunisia 9 the wastewater tested didn t present excessive salts concentrations because at height levels salts have an adverse effect and they reduce dry biomass this data was founded by alghobar and suresha 2 in rice plants irrigated with an industrial treated wastewater concerning chlorophyll a and b contents the two tested varieties registered different amounts between treatments in fact chlorophyll content is usually affected by various environmental factors such as water 12 33 also this variation can be explained by genetic factors influencing chlorophyll content this finding was founded by bojovic and markovic 10 on wheat leaf chetoui cultivars irrigated with tww showed a significant increase of chlorophyll a content compared with those receiving tw treatment to reach a value similar to chemlali cultivar these finding are in agreement with herteman et al 18 who reported that the application of recycled water enhances chlorophyll pigment concentration in mangroves leaves wastewater is not only a valuable source of water but also a rich source of nutrients the concentration and the uptake of these nutrients by plants through irrigation with recycled water were the major factors in enhanced chlorophyll content 6 the tww tested in this paper was rich on mg known as necessary for the synthesis of chlorophyll 25 plant secondary metabolites especially phenols confer protection against a wide range of environmental stresses 27 the significant increase of polyphenols in chetoui and chemlali roots receiving tww may be due to a water stress condition which can lead to the elevation of reactive oxygen species therefore higher contents of antioxidants is required to compensate stress condition and increase the tolerance 27 the literature reported that this enhancement may be due to the metals chelating activity of polyphenols 5 in contrast leaves polyphenols contents of the two tested varieties irrigated with tww were lower than those registered by plants treated with tw paiva and dixon 22 attributed this difference to a nutritional stresses like low nitrogen concentration inducing flavonoids and isoflavonoids synthesis or in our case the wastewater tested is rich with nitrogen the wastewater has a considerable content of nutrients therefore his application improves the plant growth characteristics and increase mineral elements concentration in olive leaves 26 but more efforts must be made to explore varietal changes in response to wastewater irrigation in olive cultivars 23 5 conclusion data resulting from this work improve the fundamental knowledge about the growth and biochemical composition of olive plants in response to tww irrigation and such a determination is very important to explore varietal changes in fact we suggest that olive plants response was not only dependent on the water resource but also on varietal changes in tunisia and in terms of economical weight oleiculture is one of the principal sectors of agriculture and chemlali variety accounts for 80 of oil production under the light of our results dairy industrial wastewater tested improves biomass production of this variety also there are no significant differences in terms of chlorophyll a and b contents between chemlali receiving tw and chemlali receiving tww plants so this water may be an alternative water source in irrigation of olive orchards under water scarcity situation especially after showing in this paper that this water does not contain antibiotics in addition these findings must be accomplished with an analytical study of olive oil quality more studies are needed for a clear understanding of the impact of irrigation with this treated wastewater on soil properties and his microbial community the present experimental work improves the fundamental knowledge about the growth and biochemical composition of olive plants in

polyphenols content of olive leaf and root extracts following irrigation with tw and tww the data presented in table 5 indicates that leaf polyphenols l polyphenols in tw irrigated chetoui and tw irrigated chemlali registered the highest contents chetoui cultivar was characterized by the significant highest l polyphenols content in response to tw and tww compared with chemlali cultivar root polyphenols r polyphenols were quantified after each treatment and results were shown in table 5 significant differences p 0 05 were encountered for the root chetoui and chemlali polyphenols between the two treatments these two varieties registered the highest contents in response to tww irrigation 9586 99 and 5674 19 mg kg respectively after irrigation with tw or with tww the greater value of r polyphenols was obtained by chetoui samples 4 discussion tunisia suffers a very severe fresh water shortage as other arab countries the reuse of the non conventional water seems to be a reliable solution in the present work the evaluation of water type tested on olive morphology indicated that it was no positive effect of tww on chetoui branch elongation leaf area and dry leaves weight these results indicate a high correlation between growth parameters which may results from the anatomical relationship between different olive tree parts characterizing olive species 20 on the another hand this data is in accordance with results obtained by trad et al 28 who reported that dry leaves weight of chetoui cultivar was not significantly influenced by the irrigation with tww and this parameter is independent of irrigation water source leaf area in chemlali cultivar irrigated with tww increases compared with those receiving tw the results obtained confirm the finding of charfi et al 11 who indicated that leaf area of olives irrigated with treated wastewater was higher than those of the control thus the enhancement of leaf area and dry leaves weight can be explained by the tww wealth containing a significant quantity of nutrients as well as essential elements n p k compared to tw 16 our data indicates that the flowering was better when chetoui and chemlali plants are irrigated with tww compared with those receiving tw this result may be correlated with the height nutritive value of this water the decreasing of branch elongation under tww treatment and the increasing of flowering parameters may have resulted from competition for assimilates between branch elongation and fructification our results are in accordance with data obtained by masmoudi charfi and ben mechlia 20 indicating that in chetoui cultivar development of olives from flowering to harvest may affect branch elongation in chemlali variety the positive effect of wastewater on production parameters has been also reported by bedbabis et al 8 it was reflected by a significant yield increasing therefore this water was considered as fertigation stimulator this data is not in line with results obtained by alghobar et al 2 in fact they founded that irrigation with sewage treated wastewater didn t improve production characters of rice crop under this industrial treated wastewater usage a significant increase was seen in dry roots weight of chetoui and chemlali samples table 5 over that of the control tw this increase in chemlali plants explains the highest root density reaching a value of 0 27 fig 1 this root density may provide an excellent detection of nutrients especially immobile accumulated near the soil surface in another side many investigators have reported a substantial increase in biomass production upon recycled effluent application on several species 32 as well as on olive 11 this finding may not be observed in chetoui olives witch the enhancement of dry roots weight can be explained by pedo climatic stresses since this cultivar is widespread in the north of tunisia 9 the wastewater tested didn t present excessive salts concentrations because at height levels salts have an adverse effect and they reduce dry biomass this data was founded by alghobar and suresha 2 in rice plants irrigated with an industrial treated wastewater concerning chlorophyll a and b contents the two tested varieties registered different amounts between treatments in fact chlorophyll content is usually affected by various environmental factors such as water 12 33 also this variation can be explained by genetic factors influencing chlorophyll content this finding was founded by bojovic and markovic 10 on wheat leaf chetoui cultivars irrigated with tww showed a significant increase of chlorophyll a content compared with those receiving tw treatment to reach a value similar to chemlali cultivar these finding are in agreement with herteman et al 18 who reported that the application of recycled water enhances chlorophyll pigment concentration in mangroves leaves wastewater is not only a valuable source of water but also a rich source of nutrients the concentration and the uptake of these nutrients by plants through irrigation with recycled water were the major factors in enhanced chlorophyll content 6 the tww tested in this paper was rich on mg known as necessary for the synthesis of chlorophyll 25 plant secondary metabolites especially phenols confer protection against a wide range of environmental stresses 27 the significant increase of polyphenols in chetoui and chemlali roots receiving tww may be due to a water stress condition which can lead to the elevation of reactive oxygen species therefore higher contents of antioxidants is required to compensate stress condition and increase the tolerance 27 the literature reported that this enhancement may be due to the metals chelating activity of polyphenols 5 in contrast leaves polyphenols contents of the two tested varieties irrigated with tww were lower than those registered by plants treated with tw paiva and dixon 22 attributed this difference to a nutritional stresses like low nitrogen concentration inducing flavonoids and isoflavonoids synthesis or in our case the wastewater tested is rich with nitrogen the wastewater has a considerable content of nutrients therefore his application improves the plant growth characteristics and increase mineral elements concentration in olive leaves 26 but more efforts must be made to explore varietal changes in response to wastewater irrigation in olive cultivars 23 5 conclusion data resulting from this work improve the fundamental knowledge about the growth and biochemical composition of olive plants in response to tww irrigation and such a determination is very important to explore varietal changes in fact we suggest that olive plants response was not only dependent on the water resource but also on varietal changes in tunisia and in terms of economical weight oleiculture is one of the principal sectors of agriculture and chemlali variety accounts for 80 of oil production under the light of our results dairy industrial wastewater tested improves biomass production of this variety also there are no significant differences in terms of chlorophyll a and b contents between chemlali receiving tw and chemlali receiving tww plants so this water may be an alternative water source in irrigation of olive orchards under water scarcity situation especially after showing in this paper that this water does not contain antibiotics in addition these findings must be accomplished with an analytical study of olive oil quality more studies are needed for a clear understanding of the impact of irrigation with this treated wastewater on soil properties and his microbial community the present experimental work improves the fundamental knowledge about the growth and biochemical composition of olive plants in response to tww irrigation and such a determination is very important to explore varietal changes in tunisia and in terms of economical weight oleiculture is one of the principal sectors of agriculture and chemlali variety accounts for 80 of oil production under the light of our results dairy industrial wastewater tested improves biomass production of this variety marked by a dry roots weight of 42 55 g and a dry leaves weight reaching a value of 35 16 g also there are no significant differences in terms of chlorophyll a and b contents between chemlali receiving tw and chemlali
