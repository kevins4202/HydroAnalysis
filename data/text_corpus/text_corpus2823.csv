cycles in addition a promising issue should be noted that the black silver and silver sulfide particles can be harvested during the regeneration process keywords polyvinylidene fluoride functional membrane thiourea group adsorption silver recovery adsorption diffusion equations 1 introduction silver as a noble metal has been widespread applied in various industries such as electroplating automobile and jewelry due to its excellent properties of malleability ductility glossiness electrical and thermal conductivity 1 3 however a large amount of ag i containing effluent was released to the ecosystem thus causing the environmental pollution being similar to cadmium lead and other heavy metals ag i behaves the characteristics of non biodegradation and bioaccumulation and can enter organisms through the food chain thereby resulting in a serious of diseases 4 6 although silver is not as expensive as gold and platinum it is still rare on earth from the standpoint of mitigating environmental hazards and the benefit of silver sustainability it is crucial to develop robust sufficient and cost effective techniques for the recovery of ag i from wastewater up to now a variety of techniques such as electrolysis reduction 7 precipitation 8 ion exchange 9 adsorption 2 5 10 11 and membrane separation 12 13 have been employed for removing ag i from aqueous solutions among them the membrane separation technology has attracted enormous attention because of the merits of non existence of phase change convenience insignificantly environmental risk and high efficiency 14 17 as for the membrane techniques nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro are more suitable than microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf for the removal of heavy metal ions from industrial effluents 18 20 the conventional mf and uf membranes are unfeasible for removing soluble metals on account of larger pore sizes and unfavorable affinities toward metals whereas these two membranes have significant advantages over nf and ro such as needless strict pretreatment high permeation flux lower operating pressure and economical investment 21 from the standpoint of engineering application except for retaining the above mentioned advantages of mf and uf membranes another function for the capture of heavy metal pollutants achieving by the incorporation of complexing groups such as sulfhydryl carboxyl and thiourea groups into the polymer matrixes of these two kinds of membranes will be of great significance to facilitate their applications in the field of wastewater treatment with respect to the state of the art of current reports a great deal of efforts have been devoted to the disposal of metal pollutants via the membrane process and some of them were illustrated as follows weiming zhang and coworkers prepared a paa zif 8 pvdf hybrid uf membrane by physically incorporating polyacrylic acid groups onto the surface of pvdf membrane for the purpose of removal of nickel from high salinity wastewater 22 gang liu s group synthesized a polyaniline poly vinylidene fluoride blend microfiltration membrane in pursuit of recovering au iii 23 in our previous studies functional groups such as diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid and ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid have been physically incorporated into pvdf membranes and the fabricated membranes have favorable properties for adsorption of ni ii cu ii and pb ii metal pollutants 24 25 based on the above illustration the pvdf type mf and or uf membranes bearing the functional groups will behave a high affinity to silver ion therefore they can be expected to effectively trap ag i from aqueous solution for the modification of organic filtration membrane the chemical grating process should be priority recommended because of uniformity and stability of the incorporated functional groups although the polyacrylic acid group has attempted to be incorporated into pvdf matrix 22 26 the removal efficiency in metal pollutants is limited to our knowledge so far throughout the published literatures most of efforts have focused on the modification in pvdf membrane via the physical blending processes as for the modification of pvdf membrane via a chemical grafting approach to capture ag i the incorporation of thiourea tu group deserves to be explored due to the excellent affinity to ag i of this group 2 27 29 hence the strategy for the fabrication of pvdf functional mf membrane bearing tu groups in the hope of removing ag i from the aqueous solution will be of great imperative in this research the pvdf membrane bearing tu groups with a significant adsorption affinity to ag i was prepared by the chemical grafting process aiming to offer a valuable guideline to recycle from the non cyanide electroplating silver rising solution the morphology chemical components functional groups hydrophilicity as well as the antifouling performance of this membrane were characterized the adsorption

placed into 10 ml of dmso and magnetically stirred for 30 min at 353 k to guarantee the uniform distribution of tu in dmso then this dmso based solution was dropwise added to the above vbc apvdf solution under magnetic stirring at 353 k this solution containing vbc apvdf and tu was gently stirred for 3 h at this temperature to ensure the chemical bonding reaction between vbc and tu molecules occurring adequately subsequently 0 3 g of pvp powder was added into this solution and the solution was magnetically stirred for 2 h at 353 k to obtain the casting solution employed for the sequential

regeneration process of the membrane in order to evaluate the hydrophilicity of the fabricated functional membrane the contact angle between water and surface of membrane was directly measured using a contact angle meter hkca 15 harke china during the testing process ultrapure water as a probe liquid was dropped on the surface of the membrane five random locations on the membrane surface were considered and the obtained data were averages of these five determined values moreover other parameters of ion exchange capacity iec point of zero charge phpzc and porosity of the membrane were measured following the reported methods 25 2 5 antifouling experiments 2 5 1 protein adsorption test the test conditions for the static adsorption of bsa on various membranes pvdf apvdf vbc apvdf and tu pvdf were shown as that 6 cm2 for the membrane surface area 50 ml and 0 8 g l 1 for the volume and concentration of the bsa solution room temperature for the test temperature and 24 h for the

ml and s is the membrane area cm2 2 5 2 filtration resistance test for comparison of the differences in antifouling performances among the membranes a cross flow microfiltration module with a membrane area of 19 625 cm2 was employed to measure the pure water permeability and the bsa solution flux 32 the process consisted of the following steps before test the membrane was immersed in deionized water for 24 h and the membrane was pre pressed for 30 min under a pressure of 0 15 mpa then the initial pure water flux was measured the membrane pore resistance r m was calculated by the eq 1 1 j w1

the resistance caused by cake layer can be ignored the membrane pore resistance r m the membrane fouling resistance r f and the cake layer resistance r c were obtained by the analyses of eqs 1 3 33 34 the flux recovery rate frr of the membrane was calculated using eq 4 35 36 3 j w2 v a Î´ t Î´ p Î¼ r m r f 4 f r r j w 2 j w 1 100 the static adsorption experiments relevant to the evaluations of

on the uptake of this metal were performed also the continuous filtration adsorption experiments for the single ag i and six coexisting substances were performed with the previously described bsa filtration system the breakthrough curves data obtained at different inflow velocities 4 5 5 5 6 5 ml min 1 membrane stack thicknesses 0 15 0 35 0 55 mm initial concentrations of ag i 0 4 1 1 6 mmol l

analysis of partial differential equations pdes relevant to ag i transport through the tu pvdf membrane are depicted in fig 2 in the adsorption process of ag i accompanied by this metal transport through the functional membrane there will be present the distribution of ag i along the longitudinal thickness direction 37 the equations of pdes equations s5 s10 were employed for illustrating the distribution of ag i the corresponding parameters for above equations were as follows l 0 35 mm c 0 1 mmol l 1 k ads 0 94 l mol 1 s 1 k des 2 12 10 5 s 1 q 1 8 mol kg 1 d 1 94 10 9 m2 s 1 u 1 10 4 m s 1 and Îµ 0 64 2 7 regeneration studies when the equilibrium state of ag i adsorption on the tu pvdf membrane was attained the membrane was taken out from the solution and fully washed by deionized water to remove the residual ag i then desorption experiments were carried out at 298 k in three systems tu hno3 tu and hno3 mixed solution the optimum eluent system was confirmed by the short desorption equilibrium time and the high desorption efficiency the saturated membrane was immersed in 100 ml of eluent at room temperature to release the adsorbed ag i after desorption the membrane was immersed in 200 ml of solution 1 mmol l 1 for the concentration of ag i ph at 6 0 for the uptake of ag i again the regeneration performance of the membrane was evaluated by repeating the above adsorption desorption processes eight times the adsorption capacity of tu pvdf membrane and adsorption decline rate adr of ag i were calculated by eqs s2 and 5 respectively in eq 5 q 1 and q n mmol g 1 are the first cycle equilibrium capacity of ag i and the equilibrium uptake of this metal over n runs n 2 8 respectively 5 a d r q 1 q n q 1 100 in addition for the desorption process of the tu pvdf membrane nabh4 with an addition of 1 g was attempted to add to the exhausted eluent 0 3 mol l 1 tu and 0 1 mol l 1 hno3 and the black precipitates can be collected after filtration the ph value of this eluent was adjusted to 1 5 using 3 mol l 1 hno3 solution for further regeneration of the spent membrane the above mentioned eluent was reused eight times to evaluate its reused performance and its loss rate lr was assessed via eq 6 where w 1 mmol l 1 is the amount of collected precipitates from 100 ml of eluent for the first time and w n mmol l 1 is that after n times n 2 8 6 l r w 1 w n w 1 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the tu pvdf membrane 3 1 1 morphology analysis the surface and cross sectional morphologies of the tu pvdf membrane at different magnifications are shown in fig 3 as can be seen from fig 3 a the pvdf functional membrane has a uniform microporous surface structure and the pore diameter ranges from 0 1 to 0 2 Î¼m a part of surface location of the membrane the blue circle in fig 3 a1 was selected for surface scanning of the elements the eds scanning maps fig 3 a2 and a3 show that n and s elements are observed indicating the incorporation of tu groups into the pvdf matrix after the adsorption experiment the presence of ag element on the surface of membrane can be ascertained fig 3 a4 thereby suggesting the adsorption of ag i by the tu pvdf membrane as well known the micropore type or sponge like structure for the inner layer of the membrane will be advantageous to the enhancement in permeation flux 38 interestingly herein two kinds of cross sectional structures at different locations can be identified fig 3 b and c namely one is that the whole cross sectional morphology of the membrane looks close to the spongy structure fig 3 b the other is that the typical asymmetric morphology of the membrane is confirmed fig 3 c this asymmetric structure consists of finger like top layer ii and spongy inner layer iii which would be helpful for the reduction in membrane resistance the increment in filtration flux of the penetrant and the increase in rejects of some materials such as collids and nano size microparticles in addition the measured iec phpzc and porosity of this pvdf based functional membrane are 0 523 mmol g 1 6 0 and 64 respectively 3 1 2 characterizations of raman and ftir raman spectra of the pvdf microsphere before and after the alkalization treatment were measured to confirm the formation of the cc bond compare with that of the pristine pvdf microsphere two peaks appearing at 1125 and 1530 cm 1 fig s1 a for the alkalized pvdf sample can be observed they are assigned to cc and cc 39 respectively thus the cc bond is formed after the alkalization treatment ftir spectra of the pvdf membrane and the tu pvdf membrane were determined fig s1 b the two peaks at 470 and 3025 cm 1 are ascribed to the swing and vibration of cf group of pvdf molecular chain 39 as for that of tu pvdf membrane the new peaks at 3470 and 1560 cm 1 are attributable to the vibration of nh and ncn stretch respectively a weak peak locating at 670 cm 1 relevant to the stretching vibration of ncs is detected thereby indicating the incorporation of tu groups 40 41 the characteristic absorption of cs bond presents at 1470 cm 1 40 also suggesting that the tu groups are successfully incorporated onto the pvdf chain 3 1 3 xps analysis the chemical compositions of the tu pvdf membrane before and after adsorption ag i were analyzed by xps fig 4 it can be seen there are five peaks present in the full xps spectrum before adsorption ag i fig 4 a they are attributable to c1s 286 ev f1s 688 ev o1s 532 ev n1s 400 ev and s2p 164 ev the presences of n1s and s2p peaks suggest that the tu groups were incorporated into the pvdf matrix in fig 4 b apart from above five peaks a new peak appears at 368 ev linked to the loaded ag3d thus confirming the adsorption of ag i by the membrane additionally the deconvoluted xps spectra of n1s before and after adsorption ag i are displayed in fig 4 c and d before the ag i adsorption two peaks 399 76 and 399 2 ev can be assigned to the cnh and cnh2 40 42 after the uptake of ag i these two peaks slightly shift to 400 and 399 38 ev this may be due to the coordination interaction between ag i and n atoms in tu groups 40 the s2p xps spectra of the tu pvdf membrane before the adsorption of ag i are presented in fig 4 e and f it can be observed that there are three peaks 168 163 44 and 164 5 ev can be observed suggesting the existence of tu groups 40 42 after the uptake of ag i the two peaks appearing at 163 44 and 164 5 ev shift to 163 17 and 164 22 ev respectively which might be due to the complexing interaction between s atom and this metal in addition the presence of peak related to s2p 160 84 ev verifies the complexing interaction between the s atom and ag i 3 2 hydrophilicity and antifouling performance of the tu pvdf membrane it has generally accepted that the hydrophilic nature plays a positive role for the enhancement in permeability and antifouling performance of the filtration membranes the contact angle test is a kind of appropriate method to assess the hydrophilicity of filtration membrane the small contact angle is the high hydrophilicity of the membrane will be 43 in this case the easily wetted membrane will show favorable antifouling performance and the solution can readily permeate through the membrane the measured water contact angles of pvdf apvdf vbc apvdf and tu pvdf membranes are reported in fig 5 a compared with that of the pvdf membrane 85 5 other three membranes will behave desirable hydrophilic properties because of the smaller values of contact angles 74 8 for apvdf 61 4 for vbc apvdf and 55 1 for tu pvdf this can be explained by the coexistence of hydroxyl oh amino nh2 and or carboxyl cooh groups in these membranes after the alkalization treatment and sequential grafting process although the porosity of the pvdf membrane 62 5 is very close to that of the tu pvdf membrane 64 the flux of bsa solution for pvdf functional membrane 365 l m 2 h 1 is more higher than that of pvdf membrane 240 l m 2 h 1 therefore the hydrophilicity of the fabricated pvdf functional membrane is obviously improved which also is attested by the fact of the smaller uptake of bsa 5 2 mg cm 2 compared with other three membranes 13 3 mg cm 2 for pvdf 10 4 mg cm 2 for apvdf and 8 2 mg cm 2 for vbc apvdf during the first two cycling filtration tests of bsa aqueous solution permeating through pvdf membrane and tu pvdf membrane the variations fig 5 b and table 1 in time dependent permeability were analyzed to evaluate the antifouling performances of these two membranes it can be observed that the permeate fluxes of bsa for both membranes significantly decrease with the extension of time it can be due to the adsorption of this protein on the surfaces of membranes after the backwashing the permeation fluxes of these two membranes increase to some extent and the tu pvdf membrane exhibits a more remarkable efficiency in flux resumption 90 than the pvdf membrane due to its promising hydrophilic property besides obtained values of flux recovery ratio frr and three kinds of fouling ratios r t r r and r ir are reported in table 1 the frr value of tu pvdf membrane 90 is about as 2 times as that of the pvdf membrane 48 also this functional membrane behaves a more desirable antifouling performance than the pvdf membrane on account of smaller values of r tot r m r f and r c the calculated resistances of the pvdf membrane are as follows r tot 7 39 1012 m 1 r m 2 51 1012 m 1 r f 2 73 1012 m 1and r c 2 15 1012 m 1 while for the tu pvdf membrane they are shown as that 2 76 1012 m 1 for r tot 1 65 1012 m 1 for r m 1 90 1011 m 1 for r f and 9 20 1011 m 1 for r c fig 5 c it can be concluded that the intrinsic resistance fouling resistance and the resistance caused by the filtration cake layer cannot be neglected for the filtration process of pristine pvdf membrane while as for tu pvdf membrane the intrinsic resistance is most remarkable the difference in filtration resistance between these two membranes may be attributed to their different hydrophilicities thus from the perspective of engineering application the tu pvdf membrane deserves to be developed 3 3 analysis of the adsorption of ag i 3 3 1 effects of various factors the detailed analyses for effects of conventional parameters on the ag i uptake are reported in supplementary document and the main results are as follows at the optimum ph of 6 the maximum uptake of ag i is 1 6 mmol g 1 the adsorption capacities of ag i increase rapidly in the first 240 min and the equilibrium adsorption reaches at 360 min fig s2 when the initial concentration of ag i is 0 25 mmol l 1 the removal rate can arrive 99 the uptake of ag i decreases with the increase in temperature suggesting the exothermic nature of ag i adsorption actually ag i containing wastewater will consist of some coexisting substances which can disturb the capture of ag i herein three cations cu ii ni ii and co ii and three complexing reagents ta edta na2s2o3 were selected as the target disturbances because they are always detected in effluent discharged from the silver electroplating process the detrimental effects of the above mentioned six substances on the ag i uptake are reported in fig 6 the disturbance of three coexisting cations follows a trend of co ii ni ii cu ii and that of three complexing reagents is in the order na2s2o3 edta ta the concentrations of ag and six coexisting substances were 1 mmol l 1 the adsorption of ag i gradually decreases with the increase in concentration of coexisting substances from 2 to 5 mmol l 1 except na2s2o3 compared with those of the three complexing reagents the disturbing influences of three cations are relatively unconspicuous for example when the concentrations of six coexisting substances were 1 mmol l 1 the adsorption of ag i by tu pvdf membrane decreases by 2 5 for cu ii 4 4 for ni ii and 6 3 for co ii while those of three complexing reagents are as follows 15 1 for ta 57 5 for edta and 65 for na2s2o3 the above mentioned disturbances of coexisting substances can be explained as follows the coexisting cations can compete with ag i for the occupation of adsorption sites on tu pvdf membrane resulting in the disturbance in the uptake of ag i for the coexisting complexing agents ag i will form some complexes with them and the tu pvdf membrane cannot easily to trap this metal ion from the complexes thus decreasing the ag i uptake of the membrane in addition we compare the ag i uptake of tu pvdf membrane with those of some reported adsorbents listed in table s1 it can be confirmed that the tu pvdf membrane shows an outstanding affinity toward ag i hence it can be expected the application of tu pvdf membrane in recycling the noble silver from the dilute solution containing this metal ion 3 3 2 analyses of adsorption kinetic and adsorption isotherm the experimental data for adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm of the ag i uptake at 298 k by the tu pvdf membrane for seven systems single ag i cu ii ag i ni ii ag i co ii ag i ta ag i edta ag i and na2s2o3 ag i are shown in figs s3 and s4 the eqs s11 s15 were employed to describe the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm the corresponding results are reported in tables s2 and s3 the pseudo second order pso equation is more suitable than pseudo first order pfo equation for illustrating the adsorption process of ag i on the tu pvdf membrane therefore the rate limiting step of the uptake behavior of ag i will be a chemisorption process rather than the physisorption procedure the langmuir model is more applicable to describe the isotherm adsorption process suggesting the behavior of monolayer adsorption of ag i the average of adsorption energy e derived from d r model ranges from 10 1 16 7 kj mol 1 interpreting the chemisorption characteristics of the membrane toward ag i furthermore the adsorption nature of ag i onto the tu pvdf membrane is further revealed by the three thermodynamic parameters standard free energy change Î´g standard enthalpy change Î´h and standard entropy change Î´s obtained via eqs s16 s17 the values of them table s4 imply the spontaneous and exothermic characteristic of ag i adsorption 3 4 analysis of continuous adsorption study 3 4 1 analysis of breakthrough curves the data of breakthrough curves at three inflow velocities 4 5 5 5 6 5 ml min 1 are reported in fig s5 a where the thicknesses of membrane stack and the concentration of ag i in influent were kept as 0 35 mm and 1 mmol l 1 respectively the experimental data were analyzed using the thomas model and the results are tabulated in table s5 it can be seen that with the increase of inflow velocity the corresponding breakthrough curve becomes steep and the breakthrough time t b and exhaustion time t e shorten because ag i has not enough time to contact the active sites of the tu pvdf membrane for the capture of this metal in the subsequent tests the inflow velocity was selected as 4 5 ml min 1 the tmp goes up from 0 1 to 0 3 mpa as the thickness of membrane stack increases from 0 15 mm to 0 55 mm showing the large thickness will result in the high loss in inflow pressure before the breakthrough point with the increase in thickness of membrane stack there is only trace of ag i in the effluent because the sufficient unoccupied sites can be employed for the capture of this metal after the breakthrough the shapes of breakthrough curves become sharper indicating that almost active sites are occupied furthermore under the identical conditions 4 5 ml min 1 for inflow velocity 0 35 mm for the thicknesses of membrane stack 1 mmol l 1 for ag i in influent the filtration volumes at t e for seven systems are as follows 549 ml for single ag i 441 ml for cu ii ag i 387 ml for ni ii ag i 338 ml for co ii ag i 293 ml for ta ag i 263 ml for edta ag i and 149 ml for na2s2o3 ag i the interferences of coexisting cations and complexing reagents are also verified fig s5 d with a descending order of na2s2o3 edta ta co ii ni ii cu ii among them na2s2o3 and edta deserve to be concerned due to their notably interferential effects on the adsorption of ag i in addition with respect to the correlation coefficient r 2 0 99 the thomas model is suitable for describing the breakthrough process for the aforesaid seven systems the obtained value of k th table s5 increases as the following order single ag i cu ii ag i ni ii ag i co ii ag i ta ag i edta ag i na2s2o3 ag i consistent with the sequence of k 2 adsorption rate of pso kinetic equation 3 4 2 analysis of pdes as for the analysis of pdes for the single ag i system based on established 2d and 3d membrane filtration models the thickness of membrane stack is 0 35 mm the trapped amounts of ag i at different time by tu pvdf membrane are shown in fig 7 a c it can be obviously seen that the uptake of ag i gradually decreases along the longitudinal filtration direction of the membrane stack this is due to that partial metal ions are adsorbed by the upside active sits of the tu pvdf membrane thereby causing the ag i concentration of inflow becoming lower when it contacts the underpart of the membrane moreover at the same position along the solution inflow direction of the membrane stack the adsorption capacity of ag i rises with the filtration time prolonging in addition the aforementioned analyzed result is validated by the eds characterization after the continuous filtration experiment the tested membrane stack fig 7 d was employed to determine the distribution of ag i fig 7 e as shown in fig 7 e it can be intuitively observed that the captured ag i on the cross section of membrane stack shows a decreasing trend with the depth of membrane stack 3 5 regeneration of the tu pvdf membrane the reused properties of tu pvdf membrane and the eluent are very crucial for the practical application thus the desorption efficiency de and desorption equilibrium time det of tu pvdf membrane were studied using different concentrations of tu hno3 and tu hno3 solutions table s6 by comparison of de and det 0 3 mol l 1 tu 0 1 mol l 1 hno3 mixed solution will be more suitable for the regeneration of ag i loaded membrane de 99 det is about 15 min this can be explained as that with the presence of hno3 nh2 group will convert to nh3 thereby weakening the interaction between the membrane and ag i the uptakes of ag i by the membrane for 8 adsorption desorption cycles are shown in fig 8 a it can be seen that the tu pvdf membrane could be repeatedly used without the significant decrease in adsorption capacity for example adr is only 4 12 after 8 runs with this regard we are sure that the tu pvdf membrane has the charming stability and reusability the reused property of eluent is displayed by fig 8 b it can be seen that the desorption efficiency of tu pvdf membrane could still reach to 90 of the initial value as the eluent were reused 8 times for the 8th cycle the reagent of nabh4 was added to the eluent interestingly some black precipitates present in the eluent the xrd pattern of collected precipitate is shown in fig 9 a the four peaks appearing at 2Î¸ 38 12

separation of formed precipitates it should be mentioned that as the ph value of eluent was adjusted to 1 5 using 3 mol l 1 hno3 solution this eluent can be reemployed for the regeneration of spent tu pvdf membrane 4 conclusions in this study a pvdf based functional membrane bearing the thiourea groups was prepared for the recovery of ag i from the aqueous solution the morphology functional groups chemical components and hydrophilicity of the fabricated tu pvdf membrane were characterized the adsorption performance of the membrane for trapping ag i was equivalently evaluated by a series of tests also its reused property was assessed the main conclusions are displayed as follows 1 the fabricated tu pvdf membrane shows a promising affinity toward ag i the kinetic adsorption and isotherm adsorption processes of this metal can be favorably described by the pseudo second order kinetic equation and langmuir isotherm model respectively the adsorption process of ag i by the membrane exhibits a spontaneous and exothermic feature it will provide a firm guideline to recover noble silver from the emissions of silver electroplating industries 2 the coexisting substances reduce the adsorption of ag i and the disturbing effects of them follow the order of cu ii ni ii co ii ta edta na2s2o3 although the interferences of the above six coexisting substances are present the fabricated tu pvdf membrane can still trap ag i from the solution 3 during ag i transport through the membrane the distribution gradient of this metal along the longitudinal filtration direction of the membrane stack is verified by the pdes analysis and the eds measurement the membrane shows an excellent reused performance when the mixed solution containing 0 3 mol l 1 thiourea and 0 1 mol l 1 hno3 is

membrane thiourea group adsorption silver recovery adsorption diffusion equations 1 introduction silver as a noble metal has been widespread applied in various industries such as electroplating automobile and jewelry due to its excellent properties of malleability ductility glossiness electrical and thermal conductivity 1 3 however a large amount of ag i containing effluent was released to the ecosystem thus causing the environmental pollution being similar to cadmium lead and other heavy metals ag i behaves the characteristics of non biodegradation and bioaccumulation and can enter organisms through the food chain thereby resulting in a serious of diseases 4 6 although silver is not as expensive as gold and platinum it is still rare on earth from the standpoint of mitigating environmental hazards and the benefit of silver sustainability it is crucial to develop robust sufficient and cost effective techniques for the recovery of ag i from wastewater up to now a variety of techniques such as electrolysis reduction 7 precipitation 8 ion exchange 9 adsorption 2 5 10 11 and membrane separation 12 13 have been employed for removing ag i from aqueous solutions among them the membrane separation technology has attracted enormous attention because of the merits of non existence of phase change convenience insignificantly environmental risk and high efficiency 14 17 as for the membrane techniques nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro are more suitable than microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf for the removal of heavy metal ions from industrial effluents 18 20 the conventional mf and uf membranes are unfeasible for removing soluble metals on account of larger pore sizes and unfavorable affinities toward metals whereas these two membranes have significant advantages over nf and ro such as needless strict pretreatment high permeation flux lower operating pressure and economical investment 21 from the standpoint of engineering application except for retaining the above mentioned advantages of mf and uf membranes another function for the capture of heavy metal pollutants achieving by the incorporation of complexing groups such as sulfhydryl carboxyl and thiourea groups into the polymer matrixes of these two kinds of membranes will be of great significance to facilitate their applications in the field of wastewater treatment with respect to the state of the art of current reports a great deal of efforts have been devoted to the disposal of metal pollutants via the membrane process and some of them were illustrated as follows weiming zhang and coworkers prepared a paa zif 8 pvdf hybrid uf membrane by physically incorporating polyacrylic acid groups onto the surface of pvdf membrane for the purpose of removal of nickel from high salinity wastewater 22 gang liu s group synthesized a polyaniline poly vinylidene fluoride blend microfiltration membrane in pursuit of recovering au iii 23 in our previous studies functional groups such as diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid and ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonic acid have been physically incorporated into pvdf membranes and the fabricated membranes have favorable properties for adsorption of ni ii cu ii and pb ii metal pollutants 24 25 based on the above illustration the pvdf type mf and or uf membranes bearing the functional groups will behave a high affinity to silver ion therefore they can be expected to effectively trap ag i from aqueous solution for the modification of organic filtration membrane the chemical grating process should be priority recommended because of uniformity and stability of the incorporated functional groups although the polyacrylic acid group has attempted to be incorporated into pvdf matrix 22 26 the removal efficiency in metal pollutants is limited to our knowledge so far throughout the published literatures most of efforts have focused on the modification in pvdf membrane via the physical blending processes as for the modification of pvdf membrane via a chemical grafting approach to capture ag i the incorporation of thiourea tu group deserves to be explored due to the excellent affinity to ag i of this group 2 27 29 hence the strategy for the fabrication of pvdf functional mf membrane bearing tu groups in the hope of removing ag i from the aqueous solution will be of great imperative in this research the pvdf membrane bearing tu groups with a significant adsorption affinity to ag i was prepared by the chemical grafting process aiming to offer a valuable guideline to recycle from the non cyanide electroplating silver rising solution the morphology chemical components functional groups hydrophilicity as well as the antifouling performance of this membrane were characterized the adsorption

placed into 10 ml of dmso and magnetically stirred for 30 min at 353 k to guarantee the uniform distribution of tu in dmso then this dmso based solution was dropwise added to the above vbc apvdf solution under magnetic stirring at 353 k this solution containing vbc apvdf and tu was gently stirred for 3 h at this temperature to ensure the chemical bonding reaction between vbc and tu molecules occurring adequately subsequently 0 3 g of pvp powder was added into this solution and the solution was magnetically stirred for 2 h at 353 k to obtain the casting solution employed for the sequential

regeneration process of the membrane in order to evaluate the hydrophilicity of the fabricated functional membrane the contact angle between water and surface of membrane was directly measured using a contact angle meter hkca 15 harke china during the testing process ultrapure water as a probe liquid was dropped on the surface of the membrane five random locations on the membrane surface were considered and the obtained data were averages of these five determined values moreover other parameters of ion exchange capacity iec point of zero charge phpzc and porosity of the membrane were measured following the reported methods 25 2 5 antifouling experiments 2 5 1 protein adsorption test the test conditions for the static adsorption of bsa on various membranes pvdf apvdf vbc apvdf and

ml and s is the membrane area cm2 2 5 2 filtration resistance test for comparison of the differences in antifouling performances among the membranes a cross flow microfiltration module with a membrane area of 19 625 cm2 was employed to measure the pure water permeability and the bsa solution flux 32 the process consisted of the following steps before test the membrane was immersed in deionized water for 24 h and the membrane was pre pressed for 30 min under a pressure of 0 15 mpa then the initial pure water flux was measured the membrane pore resistance r m was calculated by the eq 1 1 j w1

the resistance caused by cake layer can be ignored the membrane pore resistance r m the membrane fouling resistance r f and the cake layer resistance r c were obtained by the analyses of eqs 1 3 33 34

on the uptake of this metal were performed also the continuous filtration adsorption experiments for the single ag i and six coexisting substances were performed with the previously described bsa

analysis of partial differential equations pdes relevant to ag i transport through the tu pvdf membrane are depicted in fig 2 in the adsorption process of ag i accompanied by this metal transport through the functional membrane there will be present the distribution of ag i along the longitudinal thickness direction 37 the equations of pdes equations s5 s10 were employed for illustrating the distribution of ag i the corresponding parameters for above equations were as follows l 0 35 mm c 0 1 mmol l 1 k ads 0 94 l mol 1 s 1 k des 2 12 10 5 s 1 q 1 8 mol kg 1 d 1 94 10 9 m2 s 1 u 1 10 4 m s 1 and Îµ 0 64 2 7 regeneration studies when the equilibrium state of ag i adsorption on the tu pvdf membrane was attained the membrane was taken out from the solution and fully washed by deionized water to remove the residual ag i then desorption experiments were carried out at 298 k in three systems tu hno3 tu and hno3 mixed solution the optimum eluent system was confirmed by the short desorption equilibrium time and the high desorption efficiency the saturated membrane was immersed in 100 ml of eluent at room temperature to release the adsorbed ag i after desorption the membrane was immersed in 200 ml of solution 1 mmol l 1 for the concentration of ag i ph at 6 0 for the uptake of ag i again the regeneration performance of the membrane was evaluated by repeating the above adsorption desorption processes eight times the adsorption capacity of tu pvdf membrane and adsorption decline rate adr of ag i were calculated by eqs s2 and 5 respectively in eq 5 q 1 and q n mmol g 1 are the first cycle equilibrium capacity of ag i and the equilibrium uptake of this metal over n runs n 2 8 respectively 5 a d r q 1 q n q 1 100 in addition for the desorption process of the tu pvdf membrane nabh4 with an addition of 1 g was attempted to add to the exhausted eluent 0 3 mol l 1 tu and 0 1 mol l 1 hno3 and the black precipitates can be collected after filtration the ph value of this eluent was adjusted to 1 5 using 3 mol l 1 hno3 solution for further regeneration of the spent membrane the above mentioned eluent was reused eight times to evaluate its reused performance and its loss rate lr was assessed via eq 6 where w 1 mmol l 1 is the amount of collected precipitates from 100 ml of eluent for the first time and w n mmol l 1 is that after n times n 2 8 6 l r w 1 w n w 1 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of the tu pvdf membrane 3 1 1 morphology analysis the surface and cross sectional morphologies of the tu pvdf membrane at different magnifications are shown in fig 3 as can be seen from fig 3 a the pvdf functional membrane has a uniform microporous surface structure and the pore diameter ranges from 0 1 to 0 2 Î¼m a part of surface location of the membrane the blue circle in fig 3 a1 was selected for surface scanning of the elements the eds scanning maps fig 3 a2 and a3 show that n and s elements are observed indicating the incorporation of tu groups into the pvdf matrix after the adsorption experiment the presence of ag element on the surface of membrane can be ascertained fig 3 a4 thereby suggesting the adsorption of ag i by the tu pvdf membrane as well known the micropore type or sponge like structure for the inner layer of the membrane will be advantageous to the enhancement in permeation flux 38 interestingly herein two kinds of cross sectional structures at different locations can be identified fig 3 b and c namely one is that the whole cross sectional morphology of the membrane looks close to the spongy structure fig 3 b the other is that the typical asymmetric morphology of the membrane is confirmed fig 3 c this asymmetric structure consists of finger like top layer ii and spongy inner layer iii which would be helpful for the reduction in membrane resistance the increment in filtration flux of the penetrant and the increase in rejects of some materials such as collids and nano size microparticles in addition the measured iec phpzc and porosity of this pvdf based functional membrane are 0 523 mmol g 1 6 0 and 64 respectively 3 1 2 characterizations of raman and ftir raman spectra of the pvdf microsphere before and after the alkalization treatment were measured to confirm the formation of the cc bond compare with that of the pristine pvdf microsphere two peaks appearing at 1125 and 1530 cm 1 fig s1 a for the alkalized pvdf sample can be observed they are assigned to cc and cc 39 respectively thus the cc bond is formed after the alkalization treatment ftir spectra of the pvdf membrane and the tu pvdf membrane were determined fig s1 b the two peaks at 470 and 3025 cm 1 are ascribed to the swing and vibration of cf group of pvdf molecular chain 39 as for that of tu pvdf membrane the new peaks at 3470 and 1560 cm 1 are attributable to the vibration of nh and ncn stretch respectively a weak peak locating at 670 cm 1 relevant to the stretching vibration of ncs is detected thereby indicating the incorporation of tu groups 40 41 the characteristic absorption of cs bond presents at 1470 cm 1 40 also suggesting that the tu groups are successfully incorporated onto the pvdf chain 3 1 3 xps analysis the chemical compositions of the tu pvdf membrane before and after adsorption ag i were analyzed by xps fig 4 it can be seen there are five peaks present in the full xps spectrum before adsorption ag i fig 4 a they are attributable to c1s 286 ev f1s 688 ev o1s 532 ev n1s 400 ev and s2p 164 ev the presences of n1s and s2p peaks suggest that the tu groups were incorporated into the pvdf matrix in fig 4 b apart from above five peaks a new peak appears at 368 ev linked to the loaded ag3d thus confirming the adsorption of ag i by the membrane additionally the deconvoluted xps spectra of n1s before and after adsorption ag i are displayed in fig 4 c and d before the ag i adsorption two peaks 399 76 and 399 2 ev can be assigned to the cnh and cnh2 40 42 after the uptake of ag i these two peaks slightly shift to 400 and 399 38 ev this may be due to the coordination interaction between ag i and n atoms in tu groups 40 the s2p xps spectra of the tu pvdf membrane before the adsorption of ag i are presented in fig 4 e and f it can be observed that there are three peaks 168 163 44 and 164 5 ev can be observed suggesting the existence of tu groups 40 42 after the uptake of ag i the two peaks appearing at 163 44 and 164 5 ev shift to 163 17 and 164 22 ev respectively which might be due to the complexing interaction between s atom and this metal in addition the presence of peak related to s2p 160 84 ev verifies the complexing interaction between the s atom and ag i 3 2 hydrophilicity and antifouling performance of the tu pvdf membrane it has generally accepted that the hydrophilic nature plays a positive role for the enhancement in permeability and antifouling performance of the filtration membranes the contact angle test is a kind of appropriate method to assess the hydrophilicity of filtration membrane the small contact angle is the high hydrophilicity of the membrane will be 43 in this case the easily wetted membrane will show favorable antifouling performance and the solution can readily permeate through the membrane the measured water contact angles of pvdf apvdf vbc apvdf and tu pvdf membranes are reported in fig 5 a compared with that of the pvdf membrane 85 5 other three membranes will behave desirable hydrophilic properties because of the smaller values of contact angles 74 8 for apvdf 61 4 for vbc apvdf and 55 1 for tu pvdf this can be explained by the coexistence of hydroxyl oh amino nh2 and or carboxyl cooh groups in these membranes after the alkalization treatment and sequential grafting process although the porosity of the pvdf membrane 62 5 is very close to that of the tu pvdf membrane 64 the flux of bsa solution for pvdf functional membrane 365 l m 2 h 1 is more higher than that of pvdf membrane 240 l m 2 h 1 therefore the hydrophilicity of the fabricated pvdf functional membrane is obviously improved which also is attested by the fact of the smaller uptake of bsa 5 2 mg cm 2 compared with other three membranes 13 3 mg cm 2 for pvdf 10 4 mg cm 2 for apvdf and 8 2 mg cm 2 for vbc apvdf during the first two cycling filtration tests of bsa aqueous solution permeating through pvdf membrane and tu pvdf membrane the variations fig 5 b and table 1 in time dependent permeability were analyzed to evaluate the antifouling performances of these two membranes it can be observed that the permeate fluxes of bsa for both membranes significantly decrease with the extension of time it can be due to the adsorption of this protein on the surfaces of membranes after the backwashing the permeation fluxes of these two membranes increase to some extent and the tu pvdf membrane exhibits a more remarkable efficiency in flux resumption 90 than the pvdf membrane due to its promising hydrophilic property besides obtained values of flux recovery ratio frr and three kinds of fouling ratios r t r r and r ir are reported in table 1 the frr value of tu pvdf membrane 90 is about as 2 times as that of the pvdf membrane 48 also this functional membrane behaves a more desirable antifouling performance than the pvdf membrane on account of smaller values of r tot r m r f and r c the calculated resistances of the pvdf membrane are as follows r tot 7 39 1012 m 1 r m 2 51 1012 m 1 r f 2 73 1012 m 1and r c 2 15 1012 m 1 while for the tu pvdf membrane they are shown as that 2 76 1012 m 1 for r tot 1 65 1012 m 1 for r m 1 90 1011 m 1 for r f and 9 20 1011 m 1 for r c fig 5 c it can be concluded that the intrinsic resistance fouling resistance and the resistance caused by the filtration cake layer cannot be neglected for the filtration process of pristine pvdf membrane while as for tu pvdf membrane the intrinsic resistance is most remarkable the difference in filtration resistance between these two membranes may be attributed to their different hydrophilicities thus from the perspective of engineering application the tu pvdf membrane deserves to be developed 3 3 analysis of the adsorption of ag i 3 3 1 effects of various factors the detailed analyses for effects of conventional parameters on the ag i uptake are reported in supplementary document and the main results are as follows at the optimum ph of 6 the maximum uptake of ag i is 1 6 mmol g 1 the adsorption capacities of ag i increase rapidly in the first 240 min and the equilibrium adsorption reaches at 360 min fig s2 when the initial concentration of ag i is 0 25 mmol l 1 the removal rate can arrive 99 the uptake of ag i decreases with the increase in temperature suggesting the exothermic nature of ag i adsorption actually ag i containing wastewater will consist of some coexisting substances which can disturb the capture of ag i herein three cations cu ii ni ii and co ii and three complexing reagents ta edta na2s2o3 were selected as the target disturbances because they are always detected in effluent discharged from the silver electroplating process the detrimental effects of the above mentioned six substances on the ag i uptake are reported in fig 6 the disturbance of three coexisting cations follows a trend of co ii ni ii cu ii and that of three complexing reagents is in the order na2s2o3 edta ta the concentrations of ag and six coexisting substances were 1 mmol l 1 the adsorption of ag i gradually decreases with the increase in concentration of coexisting substances from 2 to 5 mmol l 1 except na2s2o3 compared with those of the three complexing reagents the disturbing influences of three cations are relatively unconspicuous for example when the concentrations of six coexisting substances were 1 mmol l 1 the adsorption of ag i by tu pvdf membrane decreases by 2 5 for cu ii 4 4 for ni ii and 6 3 for co ii while those of three complexing reagents are as follows 15 1 for ta 57 5 for edta and 65 for na2s2o3 the above mentioned disturbances of coexisting substances can be explained as follows the coexisting cations can compete with ag i for the occupation of adsorption sites on tu pvdf membrane resulting in the disturbance in the uptake of ag i for the coexisting complexing agents ag i will form some complexes with them and the tu pvdf membrane cannot easily to trap this metal ion from the complexes thus decreasing the ag i uptake of the membrane in addition we compare the ag i uptake of tu pvdf membrane with those of some reported adsorbents listed in table s1 it can be confirmed that the tu pvdf membrane shows an outstanding affinity toward ag i hence it can be expected the application of tu pvdf membrane in recycling the noble silver from the dilute solution containing this metal ion 3 3 2 analyses of adsorption kinetic and adsorption isotherm the experimental data for adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm of the ag i uptake at 298 k by the tu pvdf membrane for seven systems single ag i cu ii ag i ni ii ag i co ii ag i ta ag i edta ag i and na2s2o3 ag i are shown in figs s3 and s4 the eqs s11 s15 were employed to describe the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm the corresponding results are reported in tables s2 and s3 the pseudo second order pso equation is more suitable than pseudo first order pfo equation for illustrating the adsorption process of ag i on the tu pvdf membrane therefore the rate limiting step of the uptake behavior of ag i will be a chemisorption process rather than the physisorption procedure the langmuir model is more applicable to describe the isotherm adsorption process suggesting the behavior of monolayer adsorption of ag i the average of adsorption energy e derived from d r model ranges from 10 1 16 7 kj mol 1 interpreting the chemisorption characteristics of the membrane toward ag i furthermore the adsorption nature of ag i onto the tu pvdf membrane is further revealed by the three thermodynamic parameters standard free energy change Î´g standard enthalpy change Î´h and standard entropy change Î´s obtained via eqs s16 s17 the values of them table s4 imply the spontaneous and exothermic characteristic of ag i adsorption 3 4 analysis of continuous adsorption study 3 4 1 analysis of breakthrough curves the data of breakthrough curves at three inflow velocities 4 5 5 5 6 5 ml min 1 are reported in fig s5 a where the thicknesses of membrane stack and the concentration of ag i in influent were kept as 0 35 mm and 1 mmol l 1 respectively the experimental data were analyzed using the thomas model and the results are tabulated in table s5 it can be seen that with the increase of inflow velocity the corresponding breakthrough curve becomes steep and the breakthrough time t b and exhaustion time t e shorten because ag i has not enough time to contact the active sites of the tu pvdf membrane for the capture of this metal in the subsequent tests the inflow velocity was selected as 4 5 ml min 1 the tmp goes up from 0 1 to 0 3 mpa as the thickness of membrane stack increases from 0 15 mm to 0 55 mm showing the large thickness will result in the high loss in inflow pressure before the breakthrough point with the increase in thickness of membrane stack there is only trace of ag i in the effluent because the sufficient unoccupied sites can be employed for the capture of this metal after the breakthrough the shapes of breakthrough curves become sharper indicating that almost active sites are occupied furthermore under the identical conditions 4 5 ml min 1 for inflow velocity 0 35 mm for the thicknesses of membrane stack 1 mmol l 1 for ag i in influent the filtration volumes at t e for seven systems are as follows 549 ml for single ag i 441 ml for cu ii ag i 387 ml for ni ii ag i 338 ml for co ii ag i 293 ml for ta ag i 263 ml for edta ag i and 149 ml for na2s2o3 ag i the interferences of coexisting cations and complexing reagents are also verified fig s5 d with a descending order of na2s2o3 edta ta co ii ni ii cu ii among them na2s2o3 and edta deserve to be concerned due to their notably interferential effects on the adsorption of ag i in addition with respect to the correlation coefficient r 2 0 99 the thomas model is suitable for describing the breakthrough process for the aforesaid seven systems the obtained value of k th table s5 increases as the following order single ag i cu ii ag i ni ii ag i co ii ag i ta ag i edta ag i na2s2o3 ag i consistent with the sequence of k 2 adsorption rate of pso kinetic equation 3 4 2 analysis of pdes as for the analysis of pdes for the single ag i system based on established 2d and 3d membrane filtration models the thickness of membrane stack is 0 35 mm the trapped amounts of ag i at different time by tu pvdf membrane are shown in fig 7 a c it can be obviously seen that the uptake of ag i gradually decreases along the longitudinal filtration direction of the membrane stack this is due to that partial metal ions are adsorbed by the upside active sits of the tu pvdf membrane thereby causing the ag i concentration of inflow becoming lower when it contacts the underpart of the membrane moreover at the same position along the solution inflow direction of the membrane stack the adsorption capacity of ag i rises with the filtration time prolonging in addition the aforementioned analyzed result is validated by the eds characterization after the continuous filtration experiment the tested membrane stack fig 7 d was employed to determine the distribution of ag i fig 7 e as shown in fig 7 e it can be intuitively observed that the captured ag i on the cross section of membrane stack shows a decreasing trend with the depth of membrane stack 3 5 regeneration of the tu pvdf membrane the reused properties of tu pvdf membrane and the eluent are very crucial for the practical application thus the desorption efficiency de and desorption equilibrium time det of tu pvdf membrane were studied using different concentrations of tu hno3 and tu hno3 solutions table s6 by comparison of de and det 0 3 mol l 1 tu 0 1 mol l 1 hno3 mixed solution will be more suitable for the regeneration of ag i loaded membrane de 99 det is about 15 min this can be explained as that with the presence of hno3 nh2 group will convert to nh3 thereby weakening the interaction between the membrane and ag i the uptakes of ag i by the membrane for 8 adsorption desorption cycles are shown in fig 8 a it can be seen that the tu pvdf membrane could be repeatedly used without the significant decrease in adsorption capacity for example adr is only 4 12 after 8 runs with this regard we are sure that the tu pvdf membrane has the charming stability and reusability the reused property of eluent is displayed by fig 8 b it can be seen that the desorption efficiency of tu pvdf membrane could still reach to 90 of the initial value as the eluent were reused 8 times for the 8th cycle the reagent of nabh4 was added to the eluent interestingly some black precipitates present in the eluent the xrd pattern of collected precipitate is shown in fig 9 a the four peaks appearing at 2Î¸ 38 12

with the standard card 89 3840 of this crystal are observed also the eds spectra of the precipitate was recorded fig 9 b elements of silver and sulfur are detected and the silver element is dominant 83 96 the formation of black precipitates can be interpreted by the following eqs 45 46 7 2ag 2bh4 6h2o 2ag 2h3bo3 7h2 8 cs nh2 2 2oh s2 2h2o ch2n2 9 2ag cs nh2 2 n s2 ag2s 2ncs nh2 2 n 1 4 after the separation of formed precipitates it should be mentioned that as the ph value of eluent was adjusted to 1 5 using 3 mol l 1 hno3 solution this eluent can be reemployed for the regeneration of spent tu pvdf membrane 4 conclusions in this study a pvdf based functional membrane bearing the thiourea groups was prepared for the recovery of ag i from the aqueous solution the morphology functional groups chemical components and hydrophilicity of the fabricated tu pvdf membrane were characterized the adsorption performance of the membrane for trapping ag i was equivalently evaluated by a series of tests also its reused property was assessed the main conclusions are displayed as follows 1 the fabricated tu pvdf membrane shows a promising affinity toward ag i the kinetic adsorption and isotherm adsorption processes of this metal can be favorably described by the pseudo second order kinetic equation and langmuir isotherm model respectively the adsorption process of ag i by the membrane exhibits a spontaneous and exothermic feature it will provide a firm guideline to recover noble silver from the emissions of silver electroplating industries 2 the coexisting substances reduce the adsorption of ag i and the disturbing effects of them follow the order of cu ii ni ii co ii ta edta na2s2o3 although the interferences of the above six coexisting substances are present the fabricated tu pvdf membrane can still trap ag i from the solution 3 during ag i transport through the membrane the distribution gradient of this metal along the longitudinal filtration direction of the membrane stack is verified by the pdes analysis and the eds measurement the membrane shows an excellent reused performance when the mixed solution containing 0 3 mol l 1 thiourea and 0 1 mol l 1 hno3 is employed as the eluent also during the membrane regeneration process with the addition of nabh4 the black silver and ag2s particles can be harvested and the filtered eluent can be further reused

14116,decentralized greywater reclamation systems often experience periods of starvation during holiday seasons building shutdowns or closures due to maintenance this presents a unique challenge for biological treatment systems which require a steady supply of wastewater to nourish the microorganisms comprising the activated sludge in this research the recovery of a hybrid membrane bioreactor

comparison by the end of the starvation period it was found that the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations decreased by up to 35 as a result the removal of ammonia total nitrogen and total phosphorus decreased during the first week of recovery for the hmbr these parameters decreased from 93 66 and 90 to 59 12 and 34 respectively for the mbr these parameters decreased from 88 58 and 90 to 46 19 and 9 respectively within the following week the bioreactors recovered to their original mlvss concentrations and the treatment performances returned to their baseline values by the end of the starvation period the soluble microbial products smp increased from 7 6 to 26 5 mg g for the hmbr and from 4 7 to 27 4 mg g for the mbr consequently both bioreactors exhibited immediate fouling after four days of reactivation within one week of recovery the smp concentrations returned to their baseline values and rapid fouling was no longer observed thus both bioreactors exhibited a full recovery within approximately two weeks keywords greywater membrane bioreactor mbr extracellular polymeric substances eps soluble microbial products smp membrane fouling 1 introduction the challenges arising from water scarcity have motivated many communities to seek novel water conservation practices among these is greywater reclamation which seeks to supplement freshwater supplies while simultaneously reducing the load on existing wastewater infrastructure greywater reclamation involves the diversion of wastewater to a nearby treatment system where it can be quickly treated and returned for reuse by diverting water otherwise bound for disposal greywater reclamation can reduce bulk domestic sewage by 50 80 1 2 this presents a tremendous opportunity for wastewater recovery particularly in regions with limited freshwater supplies unlike conventional wastewater treatment greywater reclamation is commonly decentralized and designed to service either a single building or multi building array this has the benefit of greatly reducing the size of the collection network and its associated costs decentralized systems are particularly suitable for small communities and may offer greater reliability and cost effectiveness than centralized systems when carefully designed 3 4 as a consequence of decentralization the technologies utilized for greywater reclamation are required to be both resilient and robust many technologies such as constructed wetlands rotating biological contactors and membrane bioreactors mbrs are currently in use 5 due to the strict water quality requirements mandated for reclaimed water mbrs are often preferred mbrs provide high quality effluent while occupying relatively less space than conventional biological treatment systems this makes them particularly well suited for onsite greywater reclamation in addition they can be easily modified to include biocarriers suspended within the mixed liquor a modification referred to as a hybrid membrane bioreactor hmbr these biocarriers have been shown to provide several beneficial effects including greater total nitrogen removal 6 9 and lower fouling rates 10 12 the drawback of mbr and hmbr systems is their reliance on a steady supply of wastewater which is needed to nourish the microorganisms comprising the activated sludge however providing a steady supply of wastewater is not always possible in certain situations for example a greywater reclamation system installed within a school may collect little to no greywater during the summer months and holiday seasons during these times the bioreactor is deprived of food and nutrients the starved cells become metabolically dormant and enter a nonculturable state 13 15 stress conditions associated with nutrient depletion also induce the production of biomass associated products bap through the endogenous conversion of biomass 16 these include extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp the presence of eps and smp has been reported to have detrimental effects on the rate of membrane fouling 17 21 since some of these substances originate during biomass decay 22 their concentrations are likely to increase during periods of starvation this may compromise membrane performance during system recovery the objective of this research was to examine the effects of starvation on an hmbr designed for decentralized greywater treatment a conventional mbr was also operated simultaneously for comparison changes in mixed liquor characteristics treatment performances and the rates of membrane fouling were examined before and after the starvation period this was done to assess the stress tolerance of each system in order to evaluate their suitability for certain decentralized applications such as schools where periodic shutdowns are common 2 experimental methods 2 1 greywater collection untreated greywater was collected from the bathroom sinks of the research and innovation centre ric at the university of regina by means of a dual piping system installed throughout the building the untreated greywater was retained for up to 24 h in an equalization basin before treatment the characteristics of the untreated greywater are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental setup two bioreactors each filled with 36 l of activated sludge were operated simultaneously throughout the course of the experiment one bioreactor contained bioportztm biocarriers and was thus operated as an hmbr the biocarriers were composed of high density polyethylene cylinders each 15 mm in height and 18 mm in diameter each cylinder contained 12 chambers of roughly equal proportions the biocarriers occupied a filling ratio of 20 and supported an attached biomass concentration of approximately 900 60 mg vss l the other bioreactor contained only activated sludge and was thus operated as a conventional mbr the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 the hmbr and mbr were operated simultaneously for comparison excluding the starvation period the bioreactors were operated at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h and a solids retention time srt of 40 days the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentrations were approximately 3000 mg l within each bioreactor permeate extraction was achieved using submersed hollow fibre microfiltration membranes with nominal pore sizes of 0 1 Î¼m and effective surface areas of 1 32 m2 the membrane fibres were made of polyvinylidene fluoride and assembled into modules in house 23 the membranes were operated in an outside in filtration mode at a constant flux of 3 4 l m2 h the average temperature of the activated sludge was 17 1 c two 10 cm disc air stones were used to aerate the activated sludge and to provide homogeneous mixing within each bioreactor the dissolved oxygen concentration was 3 1 mg l at an aeration rate of 0 4 m3 h 2 3 methodology prior to experimentation biofilms were cultivated on the biocarriers for a period of five months during this time the activated sludge within each bioreactor was also acclimated to the untreated greywater once a mature biofilm was developed the bioreactors were operated continuously for an additional five months under constant operating conditions to establish a baseline for later comparison these data included measurements of biochemical oxygen demand bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod turbidity ammonia total nitrogen tn nitrite nitrate total phosphorus tp eps smp mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and the rates of membrane fouling during baseline data collection these parameters were monitored weekly with the exceptions of mlss mlvss and the fouling rates which were monitored every two days the membranes were considered to be fouled when the transmembrane pressure exceeded 25 kpa after the baseline data were collected each bioreactor was subjected to an eight week starvation period during which no influent greywater was supplied to the bioreactors except for minor top ups to counteract evaporation losses no sludge was wasted from the bioreactors aeration was provided to circulate the sludge and to maintain aerobic conditions since no permeate collection occurred during this time the membrane modules were removed from the bioreactors cleaned and stored in a clean water tank each week during the starvation period mixed liquor samples were drawn from each bioreactor to measure mlss and mlvss concentrations this was done to monitor the loss of biomass over time due to starvation samples for eps and smp analyses were drawn and analyzed to determine their changes in concentration throughout the starvation period observations of the sludge flocs were also made using a light microscope following the eight week starvation period the membranes were returned to the bioreactors and the flow of influent greywater was resumed mixed liquor samples were then drawn every two days to measure the growth and recovery of the biomass untreated greywater and permeate samples were also drawn to measure the treatment performance of each bioreactor during recovery the influent and effluent samples were characterized in terms of bod5 cod turbidity ammonia tn nitrite nitrate and tp samples were continually drawn until the bioreactors exhibited stable treatment performances and until the quality of the treated water met the canadian guidelines for reuse in toilet and urinal flushing 24 2 4 analytical methods hach water quality test kits were used to measure cod ammonia tn tp nitrate and nitrite turbidity was measured using a hach 2100n turbidimeter bod5 was measured using a set of oxitop c measuring heads and controller the extraction of eps and smp was accomplished using the cation exchange method 10 the eps and smp concentrations were determined as the sum of their protein and polysaccharide concentrations proteins were quantified using the lowry method while polysaccharides were quantified using the dubois method 25 mlss and mlvss were determined according to the standard methods 26 samples of the mixed liquor were drawn from both the front and back of each bioreactor and analyzed separately the sampling ports were located midway along the depth of each bioreactor the results were then averaged the fouling rate of each bioreactor was measured as the number of days taken to reach a critical transmembrane pressure of 25 kpa while operated at a constant flux of 3 4 l m2 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 biomass loss and recovery the biomass concentrations within each bioreactor were monitored in terms of their mlss and mlvss concentrations throughout the starvation and recovery periods these measurements are summarized in fig 2 from this figure it can be seen that both bioreactors exhibited equal rates of biomass loss with a decrease in mlvss of up to 35 within both bioreactors by the end of the starvation period the majority of this loss occurred during the first 14 days during which the mlvss decreased at a rate of 18 mg l per day in the following 14 days the rate decreased to 9 mg l per day and continued to decline until reaching 4 mg l per day where it remained for the final month therefore the loss of biomass was observed to decelerate over time with the rate at the beginning of the starvation period more than four times greater than at the end as a result the greatest reductions in the mlss and mlvss concentrations occurred within the first two weeks of the starvation period since there was no sludge wasting during this time the decreases in solids were assumed to result from either the release of carbon dioxide via respiration or the conversion of suspended solids to dissolved solids due to the death and disintegration of the biomass the decrease in the rate of loss likely resulted from a reduction in the metabolic activity of the surviving microorganisms in response to the lack of available food and nutrients 13 15 the biomass appeared to be effectively dormant after 40 days of starvation upon recovery the mlss and mlvss were able to return to their original concentrations within 10 days the rate of increase during this time was characteristic of exponential growth kinetics and the bacteria demonstrated a rapid recovery in the presence of surplus food and nutrients 3 2 treatment performance and recovery treated and untreated greywater samples were collected each week from each bioreactor for five months before the starvation period this was done to establish a baseline for comparison the bod5 cod turbidity ammonia tn and tp removal efficiencies for the hmbr were 97 1 92 2 99 8 0 4 93 6 66 9 and 90 3 the removal efficiencies for the mbr were 97 1 91 2 99 8 0 3 88 7 58 11 and 90 3 the baseline values for each bioreactor were generally comparable to each other during the weeks prior to the starvation period with the exception of ammonia and tn which were greater in the hmbr this was attributed to the enhanced simultaneous nitrification denitrification processes occurring within the biocarriers 6 7 during the recovery period the bod5 and cod removal efficiencies were found to be approximately equal to the baseline values despite the loss of biomass which had occurred during the starvation period within two days of recovery removal efficiencies of approximately 96 and 90 were observed within both bioreactors for bod5 and cod respectively hence the removal of bod5 and cod were largely unaffected by the starvation process these results are summarized in fig 3 the surviving bacteria were quickly revitalized during the recovery period as evidenced by the high bod5 and cod removal efficiencies as shown in fig 2 the mlvss concentrations increased rapidly during the recovery period suggesting a rapid growth rate for the bacteria populations this rapid growth utilized much of the organic material present in the influent greywater consequently the bod5 and cod removal efficiencies were consistently high throughout recovery the removal of turbidity was also unaffected by the starvation period with removal efficiencies remaining at 99 8 throughout the recovery period within each bioreactor the removal of turbidity was largely performed by the membrane module which removed most of the suspended and colloidal particles larger than the nominal pore size of the membranes hence no changes were observed in the turbidity removal efficiencies throughout the experiment regardless of the state of the biomass the bioreactors were able to produce an effluent quality compliant with the canadian guidelines within only two days of recovery these guidelines recommend a median and maximum bod5 residual of 10 and 20 mg l respectively and a median and maximum turbidity residual of 2 and 5 ntu respectively 24 in this instance the average residual bod5 and turbidity concentrations were 4 3 0 5 mg l and 0 036 0 013 ntu for the hmbr and 4 1 0 4 mg l and 0 051 0 020 ntu for the mbr respectively these results suggest that usable water can be was recovered within only a few days after the eight week starvation period the removal of nutrients in terms of ammonia tn and tp was significantly affected by the starvation period these results are summarized in fig 4 ammonia removal declined from 93 to 59 in the hmbr and from 88 to 46 in the mbr within the first two days of the recovery period during this time effluent ammonia concentrations exceeded the influent concentrations and thus produced negative removal efficiencies the residual ammonia concentrations within the hmbr and mbr permeate were 10 2 mg l and 9 39 mg l respectively while the influent ammonia concentration was 6 43 mg l the excess ammonia resulted from the decomposition of the biomass during the starvation period which caused ammonia to accumulate within the bioreactors similar results were observed by wang et al 2019 who noted a four fold increase in soluble tn mainly ammonia during starvation 27 upon the resumption of influent flow some of the accumulated ammonia was released from the bioreactors in the permeate causing a temporary increase in the effluent ammonia concentrations this effect was relatively short lived and positive removal efficiencies were observed after four days of recovery the removals of ammonia were approximately equal to the baseline values after six days of recovery suggesting that the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob were sufficiently revitalized within that time tora et al 2011 observed that their aob population recovered within only 5 days following a 30 day starvation period within an activated sludge bioreactor 28 this research is in agreement with the present findings other researchers have observed that nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob recover at a slower rate than aob which may cause nitrite to accumulate during the recovery period 29 30 the nitrite residuals measured in the bioreactor permeates support this observation the average nitrite residuals from the hmbr and mbr were 1 0 0 7 mg l and 0 9 0 8 mg l respectively which were significantly higher than their baseline values of 0 1 0 1 mg l and 0 2 0 2 mg l this suggests that the nob may have been slower to revitalize than the aob this is further supported by lower than expected nitrate residuals in the treated water the average nitrate residuals from the hmbr and mbr were 0 5 0 2 mg l and 0 6 0 2 mg l respectively which were lower than their baseline values of 0 7 0 3 mg l and 1 0 0 2 mg l it may be noted that the hmbr generally exhibited lower nitrate concentrations in the permeate due to the circulation of biocarriers within the bioreactor which enhanced denitrification the removal of tn was severely affected by the starvation period and both bioreactors exhibited a decrease in their tn removal efficiencies tn removal declined from 66 to 12 in the hmbr and 58 to 19 in the mbr within the first two days of the recovery period however removal efficiencies returned to their baseline values after one week of recovery the removal of tn was strongly correlated to the removal of ammonia since ammonia nitrogen made up about half of the tn within the influent greywater the removal of tp was also severely affected by the starvation period the tp removal decreased from 90 to 34 in the hmbr and 90 to 9 in the mbr within the first four days of the recovery period similar to the ammonia effluent tp concentrations exceeded influent concentrations due to the release of phosphorus from the decomposing biomass during the starvation period some of this accumulated phosphorus was released from the bioreactors in the permeate causing a temporary increase in the effluent tp concentrations as the biomass began to revitalize and propagate the effluent tp concentrations dropped dramatically presumably due to the uptake of phosphorus for the growth and propagation of bacteria both bioreactors returned to their baseline values within one week of recovery based on these observations a recovery time of one week following an eight week starvation period was sufficient for the bioreactors to return to their baseline performances no additional nutrients or seed sludge were required to recover the biomass and the bioreactors were capable of meeting the canadian guidelines within only two days of recovery 3 3 eps concentrations the baseline values for the eps in the hmbr and mbr were 156 20 mg g and 152 12 mg g respectively hence both bioreactors exhibited similar baseline values prior to the starvation period the eps concentrations during the starvation period are shown in fig 5 within the first week the total eps concentrations decreased to 125 mg g and 124 mg g for the hmbr and mbr respectively or approximately 20 of their original concentrations the eps concentrations then increased to a local maximum two weeks later 133 mg g for the hmbr and 141 mg g for the mbr afterwards the total eps concentrations decreased for the remainder of the starvation period the increase in the total eps concentrations during the third week coincided with the end of significant mlss and mlvss decline the increased concentrations of eps may have been produced by the bacteria as a means of protection in response to the stressful conditions of starvation 27 however after three weeks the trend reversed and the total eps concentrations began to decrease in the absence of readily biodegradable organics it is possible for the eps to be metabolized for nutrients and energy 31 some of the eps may therefore have been utilized as a source of nutrients and energy by the surviving bacteria during the second half of the starvation period as a consequence the total eps concentrations decreased during that time from the beginning to the end of the starvation period the protein to polysaccharide pn ps ratios decreased from 2 3 to 1 1 for the hmbr and 2 8 to 1 3 for the mbr therefore the effects of starvation significantly altered not only the concentration but also the composition of the eps in this instance the proportions of the proteins were reduced to more than half of their baseline values reductions in protein content have been demonstrated to reduce the surface hydrophobicity of bacterial cells making it more difficult for them to attach to surfaces 32 this suggests that the eps present during the starvation period may have exhibited a lower fouling propensity in comparison to the eps present during normal operations during recovery the eps concentrations returned to their baseline values within approximately one week in the end the total eps concentrations in the hmbr and mbr were 144 mg g and 140 mg g respectively these values were lower than the average baseline values but were within the range of previously measured values taken during normal operation the pn ps ratios also returned to their baseline values the pn ps ratios for the hmbr and mbr were 2 5 and 3 0 respectively by the end of the experiment 3 4 smp concentrations the baseline values for the smp in the hmbr and mbr were 4 1 1 6 mg g and 4 6 1 4 mg g respectively the smp concentrations during the starvation period are shown in fig 6 shortly after the starvation period began the total smp concentrations within both bioreactors increased until reaching a maximum concentration after 49 days at this time the smp concentrations within the hmbr and mbr were 27 7 mg g and 28 1 mg g respectively as such the bioreactors exhibited a six fold increase in their smp concentrations during the starvation period since the bioreactors received no influent during this time the smp was unlikely to be associated with the substrate utilization associated products uap produced through the consumption of substrate instead it was more likely associated with the release of bap through the endogenous conversion of biomass 16 the total smp concentrations did not appear to increase during the final week of the starvation period from the beginning to the end of the starvation period the pn ps ratio decreased from 1 6 to 0 7 in the hmbr and from 1 7 to 0 5 in the mbr similar to the eps the effects of starvation significantly altered both the concentration and composition of the smp both the proteins and sugars increased in concentration however by the end of the starvation period the amount of sugars was nearly twice that of the proteins the concentrations of smp returned to their normal values approximately one week after the starvation period in the end the total smp concentrations in the hmbr and mbr were 4 7 mg g and 4 6 mg g respectively the pn ps ratios increased up to 1 6 and 1 3 for the hmbr and mbr respectively these values were similar to the baseline values the effects of the starvation period were therefore relatively short lived in this regard nevertheless their impact on membrane fouling appeared to be significant during the initial days of the recovery period 3 5 membrane fouling the rates of membrane fouling were was monitored for five months prior to the starvation period to determine baseline values for later comparison during that time four filtration cycles were observed each cycle started with a clean membrane and ended once the membranes were fouled it was found that the hmbr took between 24 and 37 days to foul while the mbr took between 23 and 28 days to foul the differences in the fouling rates between the hmbr and mbr were in part attributed to the poor settleability of the flocs within the hmbr which likely resulted in less consolidation of the cake layer during fouling 10 after the starvation period the fouling times were monitored during recovery both bioreactors exhibited rapid fouling almost immediately with the hmbr membranes requiring cleaning after four days and the mbr membranes requiring cleaning after two days during the next filtration cycle the hmbr took 26 days to foul while the mbr took 23 days to foul as such the performance of the membranes with respect to fouling had returned to within their normal operating ranges the rapid rates of fouling during the initial days of recovery were likely caused by smp and other cell debris within the mixed liquor which had accumulated during the starvation period it is generally acknowledged that smp is a significant biofoulant particularly in the initial stages of fouling 33 the concentrations of smp were approximately three times greater at the end of the starvation period than during normal operation it is suspected that these compounds played a significant role in the rapid fouling of the membranes at the beginning of the recovery period however after one week of recovery the smp concentrations returned to their baseline concentrations and remained at those concentrations for the remainder of the experiment concurrently the fouling rates of the membranes also returned to within their expected ranges 3 6 additional considerations excess foam development was observed to occur at the top of each bioreactor within seven days of the starvation period initially this foam was suspected to be caused by an overgrowth of filamentous bacteria which are generally more competitive under stressful conditions brought on by a low food to microorganism ratio or a limited supply of nutrients 34 however microscopic analysis of the sludge flocs did not reveal any significant overgrowth of filamentous bacteria the foam continued to persist for the remaining duration of the starvation period even during the second month when very few filamentous bacteria were observed in the flocs the foam was therefore attributed to the accumulation of smp and other biopolymers within the mixed liquor due to the lysis and subsequent degradation of dead bacteria these biopolymers helped to stabilize the air bubbles on the liquid surface of the bioreactors within one week of recovery the foam began to subside as the smp concentrations returned to normal while the bioreactors used in this experiment possessed enough room to prevent overtopping excessive foam development may be a nuisance for some bioreactors and should therefore be taken into consideration before initiating a prolonged starvation period 4 conclusions the intent of this research was to examine the effects of starvation on an hmbr following long term starvation in order to determine its suitability for decentralized greywater reclamation a conventional mbr was also operated simultaneously for comparison it was concluded that both bioreactors recovered relatively quickly and were able to produce acceptable water quality within one week of recovery the bioreactors returned to their original mlvss concentrations within two weeks of recovery the rapid fouling which occurred within the first four days of the recovery period was attributed to the smp which had accumulated within each bioreactor during the starvation period however the smp concentrations returned to their baseline values after one week of recovery and did not appear to influence the following filtration cycle while some temporary inconveniences occurred during the initial week of recovery no lasting harm was evident by the starvation period these results suggest that both the hmbr and mbr are viable options for certain decentralized applications such as schools where periodic shutdowns are common declaration of interest none declared acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the financial contributions of the natural

hybrid membrane bioreactor hmbr these biocarriers have been shown to provide several beneficial effects including greater total nitrogen removal 6 9 and lower fouling rates 10 12 the drawback of mbr and hmbr systems is their reliance on a steady supply of wastewater which is needed to nourish the microorganisms comprising the activated sludge however providing a steady supply of wastewater is not always possible in certain situations for example a greywater reclamation system installed within a school may collect little to no greywater during the summer months and holiday seasons during these times the bioreactor is deprived of food and nutrients the starved cells become metabolically dormant and enter a nonculturable state 13 15 stress conditions associated with nutrient depletion also induce the production of biomass associated products bap through the endogenous conversion of biomass 16 these include extracellular polymeric substances eps and soluble microbial products smp the presence of eps and smp has been reported to have detrimental effects on the rate of membrane fouling 17 21 since some of these substances originate during biomass decay 22 their concentrations are likely to increase during periods of starvation this may compromise membrane performance during system recovery the objective of this research was to examine the effects of starvation on an hmbr designed for decentralized greywater treatment a conventional mbr was also operated simultaneously for comparison changes in mixed liquor characteristics treatment performances and the rates of membrane fouling were examined before and after the starvation period this was done to assess the stress tolerance of each system in order to evaluate their suitability for certain decentralized applications such as schools where periodic shutdowns are common 2 experimental methods 2 1 greywater collection untreated greywater was collected from the bathroom sinks of the research and innovation centre ric at the university of regina by means of a dual piping system installed throughout the building the untreated greywater was retained for up to 24 h in an equalization basin before treatment the characteristics of the untreated greywater are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental setup two bioreactors each filled with 36 l of activated sludge were operated simultaneously throughout the course of the experiment one bioreactor contained bioportztm biocarriers and was thus operated as an hmbr the biocarriers were composed of high density polyethylene cylinders each 15 mm in height and 18 mm in diameter each cylinder contained 12 chambers of roughly equal proportions the biocarriers occupied a filling ratio of 20 and supported an attached biomass concentration of approximately 900 60 mg vss l the other bioreactor contained only activated sludge and was thus operated as a conventional mbr the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 the hmbr and mbr were operated simultaneously for comparison excluding the starvation period the bioreactors were operated at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 8 h and a solids retention time srt of 40 days the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentrations were approximately 3000 mg l within each bioreactor permeate extraction was achieved using submersed hollow fibre microfiltration membranes with nominal pore sizes of 0 1 Î¼m and effective surface areas of 1 32 m2 the membrane fibres were made of polyvinylidene fluoride and assembled into modules in house 23 the membranes were operated in an outside in filtration mode at a constant flux of 3 4 l m2 h the average temperature of the activated sludge was 17 1 c two 10 cm disc air stones were used to aerate the activated sludge and to provide homogeneous mixing within each bioreactor the dissolved oxygen concentration was 3 1 mg l at an aeration rate of 0 4 m3 h 2 3 methodology prior to experimentation biofilms were cultivated on the biocarriers for a period of five months during this time the activated sludge within each bioreactor was also acclimated to the untreated greywater once a mature biofilm was developed the bioreactors were operated continuously for an additional five months under constant operating conditions to establish a baseline for later comparison these data included measurements of biochemical oxygen demand bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod turbidity ammonia total nitrogen tn nitrite nitrate total phosphorus tp eps smp mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and the rates of membrane fouling during baseline data collection these parameters were monitored weekly with the exceptions of mlss mlvss and the fouling rates which were monitored every two days the membranes were considered to be fouled when the transmembrane pressure exceeded 25 kpa after the baseline data were collected each bioreactor was subjected to an eight week starvation period during which no influent greywater was supplied to the bioreactors except for minor top ups to counteract evaporation losses no sludge was wasted from the bioreactors aeration was provided to circulate the sludge and to maintain aerobic conditions since no permeate collection occurred during this time the membrane modules were removed from the bioreactors cleaned and stored in a clean water tank each week during the starvation period mixed liquor samples were drawn from each bioreactor to measure mlss and mlvss concentrations this was done to monitor the loss of biomass over time due to starvation samples for eps and smp analyses were drawn and analyzed to determine their changes in concentration throughout the starvation period observations of the sludge flocs were also made using a light microscope following the eight week starvation period the membranes were returned to the bioreactors and the flow of influent greywater was resumed mixed liquor samples were then drawn every two days to measure the growth and recovery of the biomass untreated greywater and permeate samples were also drawn to measure the treatment performance of each bioreactor during recovery the influent and effluent samples were characterized in terms of bod5 cod turbidity ammonia tn nitrite nitrate and tp samples were continually drawn until the bioreactors exhibited stable treatment performances and until the quality of the treated water met the canadian guidelines for reuse in toilet and urinal flushing 24 2 4 analytical methods hach water quality test kits were used to measure cod ammonia tn tp nitrate and nitrite turbidity was measured using a hach 2100n turbidimeter bod5 was measured using a set of oxitop c measuring heads and controller the extraction of eps and smp was accomplished using the cation exchange method 10 the eps and smp concentrations were determined as the sum of their protein and polysaccharide concentrations proteins were quantified using the lowry method while polysaccharides were quantified using the dubois method 25 mlss and mlvss were determined according to the standard methods 26 samples of the mixed liquor were drawn from both the front and back of each bioreactor and analyzed separately the sampling ports were located midway along the depth of each bioreactor the results were then averaged the fouling rate of each bioreactor was measured as the number of days taken to reach a critical transmembrane pressure of 25 kpa while operated at a constant flux of 3 4 l m2 h 3 results and discussion 3 1 biomass loss and recovery the biomass concentrations within each bioreactor were monitored in terms of their mlss and mlvss concentrations throughout the starvation and recovery periods these measurements are summarized in fig 2 from this figure it can be seen that both bioreactors exhibited equal rates of biomass loss with a decrease in mlvss of up to 35 within both bioreactors by the end of the starvation period the majority of this loss occurred during the first 14 days during which the mlvss decreased at a rate of 18 mg l per day in the following 14 days the rate decreased to 9 mg l per day and continued to decline until reaching 4 mg l per day where it remained for the final month therefore the loss of biomass was observed to decelerate over time with the rate at the beginning of the starvation period more than four times greater than at the end as a result the greatest reductions in the mlss and mlvss concentrations occurred within the first two weeks of the starvation period since there was no sludge wasting during this time the decreases in solids were assumed to result from either the release of carbon dioxide via respiration or the conversion of suspended solids to dissolved solids due to the death and disintegration of the biomass the decrease in the rate of loss likely resulted from a reduction in the metabolic activity of the surviving microorganisms in response to the lack of available food and nutrients 13 15 the biomass appeared to be effectively dormant after 40 days of starvation upon recovery the mlss and mlvss were able to return to their original concentrations within 10 days the rate of increase during this time was characteristic of exponential growth kinetics and the bacteria demonstrated a rapid recovery in the presence of surplus food and nutrients 3 2 treatment performance and recovery treated and untreated greywater samples were collected each week from each bioreactor for five months before the starvation period this was done to establish a baseline for comparison the bod5 cod turbidity ammonia tn and tp removal efficiencies for the hmbr were 97 1 92 2 99 8 0 4 93 6 66 9 and 90 3 the removal efficiencies for the mbr were 97 1 91 2 99 8 0 3 88 7 58 11 and 90 3 the baseline values for each bioreactor were generally comparable to each other during the weeks prior to the starvation period with the exception of ammonia and tn which were greater in the hmbr this was attributed to the enhanced simultaneous nitrification denitrification processes occurring within the biocarriers 6 7 during the recovery period the bod5 and cod removal efficiencies were found to be approximately equal to the baseline values despite the loss of biomass which had occurred during the starvation period within two days of recovery removal efficiencies of approximately 96 and 90 were observed within both bioreactors for bod5 and cod respectively hence the removal of bod5 and cod were largely unaffected by the starvation process these results are summarized in fig 3 the surviving bacteria were quickly revitalized during the recovery period as evidenced by the high bod5 and cod removal efficiencies as shown in fig 2 the mlvss concentrations increased rapidly during the recovery period suggesting a rapid growth rate for the bacteria populations this rapid growth utilized much of the organic material present in the influent greywater consequently the bod5 and cod removal efficiencies were consistently high throughout recovery the removal of turbidity was also unaffected by the starvation period with removal efficiencies remaining at 99 8 throughout the recovery period within each bioreactor the removal of turbidity was largely performed by the membrane module which removed most of the suspended and colloidal particles larger than the nominal pore size of the membranes hence no changes were observed in the turbidity removal efficiencies throughout the experiment regardless of the state of the biomass the bioreactors were able to produce an effluent quality compliant with the canadian guidelines within only two days of recovery these guidelines recommend a median and maximum bod5 residual of 10 and 20 mg l respectively and a median and maximum turbidity residual of 2 and 5 ntu respectively 24 in this instance the average residual bod5 and turbidity concentrations were 4 3 0 5 mg l and 0 036 0 013 ntu for the hmbr and 4 1 0 4 mg l and 0 051 0 020 ntu for the mbr respectively these results suggest that usable water can be was recovered within only a few days after the eight week starvation period the removal of nutrients in terms of ammonia tn and tp was significantly affected by the starvation period these results are summarized in fig 4 ammonia removal declined from 93 to 59 in the hmbr and from 88 to 46 in the mbr within the first two days of the recovery period during this time effluent ammonia concentrations exceeded the influent concentrations and thus produced negative removal efficiencies the residual ammonia concentrations within the hmbr and mbr permeate were 10 2 mg l and 9 39 mg l respectively while the influent ammonia concentration was 6 43 mg l the excess ammonia resulted from the decomposition of the biomass during the starvation period which caused ammonia to accumulate within the bioreactors similar results were observed by wang et al 2019 who noted a four fold increase in soluble tn mainly ammonia during starvation 27 upon the resumption of influent flow some of the accumulated ammonia was released from the bioreactors in the permeate causing a temporary increase in the effluent ammonia concentrations this effect was relatively short lived and positive removal efficiencies were observed after four days of recovery the removals of ammonia were approximately equal to the baseline values after six days of recovery suggesting that the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob were sufficiently revitalized within that time tora et al 2011 observed that their aob population recovered within only 5 days following a 30 day starvation period within an activated sludge bioreactor 28 this research is in agreement with the present findings other researchers have observed that nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob recover at a slower rate than aob which may cause nitrite to accumulate during the recovery period 29 30 the nitrite residuals measured in the bioreactor permeates support this observation the average nitrite residuals from the hmbr and mbr were 1 0 0 7 mg l and 0 9 0 8 mg l respectively which were significantly higher than their baseline values of 0 1 0 1 mg l and 0 2 0 2 mg l this suggests that the nob may have been slower to revitalize than the aob this is further supported by lower than expected nitrate residuals in the treated water the average nitrate residuals from the hmbr and mbr were 0 5 0 2 mg l and 0 6 0 2 mg l respectively which were lower than their baseline values of 0 7 0 3 mg l and 1 0 0 2 mg l it may be noted that the hmbr generally exhibited lower nitrate concentrations in the permeate due to the circulation of biocarriers within the bioreactor which enhanced denitrification the removal of tn was severely affected by the starvation period and both bioreactors exhibited a decrease in their tn removal efficiencies tn removal declined from 66 to 12 in the hmbr and 58 to 19 in the mbr within the first two days of the recovery period however removal efficiencies returned to their baseline values after one week of recovery the removal of tn was strongly correlated to the removal of ammonia since ammonia nitrogen made up about half of the tn within the influent greywater the removal of tp was also severely affected by the starvation period the tp removal decreased from 90 to 34 in the hmbr and 90 to 9 in the mbr within the first four days of the recovery period similar to the ammonia effluent tp concentrations exceeded influent concentrations due to the release of phosphorus from the decomposing biomass during the starvation period some of this accumulated phosphorus was released from the bioreactors in the permeate causing a temporary increase in the effluent tp concentrations as the biomass began to revitalize and propagate the effluent tp concentrations dropped dramatically presumably due to the uptake of phosphorus for the growth and propagation of bacteria both bioreactors returned to their baseline values within one week of recovery based on these observations a recovery time of one week following an eight week starvation period was sufficient for the bioreactors to return to their baseline performances no additional nutrients or seed sludge were required to recover the biomass and the bioreactors were capable of meeting the canadian guidelines within only two days of recovery 3 3 eps concentrations the baseline values for the eps in the hmbr and mbr were 156 20 mg g and 152 12 mg g respectively hence both bioreactors exhibited similar baseline values prior to the starvation period the eps concentrations during the starvation period are shown in fig 5 within the first week the total eps concentrations decreased to 125 mg g and 124 mg g for the hmbr and mbr respectively or approximately 20 of their original concentrations the eps concentrations then increased to a local maximum two weeks later 133 mg g for the hmbr and 141 mg g for the mbr afterwards the total eps concentrations decreased for the remainder of the starvation period the increase in the total eps concentrations during the third week coincided with the end of significant mlss and mlvss decline the increased concentrations of eps may have been produced by the bacteria as a means of protection in response to the stressful conditions of starvation 27 however after three weeks the trend reversed and the total eps concentrations began to decrease in the absence of readily biodegradable organics it is possible for the eps to be metabolized for nutrients and energy 31 some of the eps may therefore have been utilized as a source of nutrients and energy by the surviving bacteria during the second half of the starvation period as a consequence the total eps concentrations decreased during that time from the beginning to the end of the starvation period the protein to polysaccharide pn ps ratios decreased from 2 3 to 1 1 for the hmbr and 2 8 to 1 3 for the mbr therefore the effects of starvation significantly altered not only the concentration but also the composition of the eps in this instance the proportions of the proteins were reduced to more than half of their baseline values reductions in protein content have been demonstrated to reduce the surface hydrophobicity of bacterial cells making it more difficult for them to attach to surfaces 32 this suggests that the eps present during the starvation period may have exhibited a lower fouling propensity in comparison to the eps present during normal operations during recovery the eps concentrations returned to their baseline values within approximately one week in the end the total eps concentrations in the hmbr and mbr were 144 mg g and 140 mg g respectively these values were lower than the average baseline values but were within the range of previously measured values taken during normal operation the pn ps ratios also returned to their baseline values the pn ps ratios for the hmbr and mbr were 2 5 and 3 0 respectively by the end of the experiment 3 4 smp concentrations the baseline values for the smp in the hmbr and mbr were 4 1 1 6 mg g and 4 6 1 4 mg g respectively the smp concentrations during the starvation period are shown in fig 6 shortly after the starvation period began the total smp concentrations within both bioreactors increased until reaching a maximum concentration after 49 days at this time the smp concentrations within the hmbr and mbr were 27 7 mg g and 28 1 mg g respectively as such the bioreactors exhibited a six fold increase in their smp concentrations during the starvation period since the bioreactors received no influent during this time the smp was unlikely to be associated with the substrate utilization associated products uap produced through the consumption of substrate instead it was more likely associated with the release of bap through the endogenous conversion of biomass 16 the total smp concentrations did not appear to increase during the final week of the starvation period from the beginning to the end of the starvation period the pn ps ratio decreased from 1 6 to 0 7 in the hmbr and from 1 7 to 0 5 in the mbr similar to the eps the effects of starvation significantly altered both the concentration and composition of the smp both the proteins and sugars increased in concentration however by the end of the starvation period the amount of sugars was nearly twice that of the proteins the concentrations of smp returned to their normal values approximately one week after the starvation period in the end the total smp concentrations in the hmbr and mbr were 4 7 mg g and 4 6 mg g respectively the pn ps ratios increased up to 1 6 and 1 3 for the hmbr and mbr respectively these values were similar to the baseline values the effects of the starvation period were therefore relatively short lived in this regard nevertheless their impact on membrane fouling appeared to be significant during the initial days of the recovery period 3 5 membrane fouling the rates of membrane fouling were was monitored for five months prior to the starvation period to determine baseline values for later comparison during that time four filtration cycles were observed each cycle started with a clean membrane and ended once the membranes were fouled it was found that the hmbr took between 24 and 37 days to foul while the mbr took between 23 and 28 days to foul the differences in the fouling rates between the hmbr and mbr were in part attributed to the poor settleability of the flocs within the hmbr which likely resulted in less consolidation of the cake layer during fouling 10 after the starvation period the fouling times were monitored during recovery both bioreactors exhibited rapid fouling almost immediately with the hmbr membranes requiring cleaning after four days and the mbr membranes requiring cleaning after two days during the next filtration cycle the hmbr took 26 days to foul while the mbr took 23 days to foul as such the performance of the membranes with respect to fouling had returned to within their normal operating ranges the rapid rates of fouling during the initial days of recovery were likely caused by smp and other cell debris within the mixed liquor which had accumulated during the starvation period it is generally acknowledged that smp is a significant biofoulant particularly in the initial stages of fouling 33 the concentrations of smp were approximately three times greater at the end of the starvation period than during normal operation it is suspected that these compounds played a significant role in the rapid fouling of the membranes at the beginning of the recovery period however after one week of recovery the smp concentrations returned to their baseline concentrations and remained at those concentrations for the remainder of the experiment concurrently the fouling rates of the membranes also returned to within their expected ranges 3 6 additional considerations excess foam development was observed to occur at the top of each bioreactor within seven days of the starvation period initially this foam was suspected to be caused by an overgrowth of filamentous bacteria which are generally more competitive under stressful conditions brought on by a low food to microorganism ratio or a limited supply of nutrients 34 however microscopic analysis of the sludge flocs did not reveal any significant overgrowth of filamentous bacteria the foam continued to persist for the remaining duration of the starvation period even during the second month when very few filamentous bacteria were observed in the flocs the foam was therefore attributed to the accumulation of smp and other biopolymers within the mixed liquor due to the lysis and subsequent degradation of dead bacteria these biopolymers helped to stabilize the air bubbles on the liquid surface of the bioreactors within one week of recovery the foam began to subside as the smp concentrations returned to normal while the bioreactors used in this experiment possessed enough room to prevent overtopping excessive foam development may be a nuisance for some bioreactors and should therefore be taken into consideration before initiating a prolonged starvation period 4 conclusions the intent of this research was to examine the effects of starvation on an hmbr following long term starvation in order to determine its suitability for decentralized greywater reclamation a conventional mbr was also operated simultaneously for comparison it was concluded that both bioreactors recovered relatively quickly and were able to produce acceptable water quality within one week of recovery the bioreactors returned to their original mlvss concentrations within two weeks of recovery the rapid fouling which occurred within the first four days of the recovery period was attributed to the smp which had accumulated within each bioreactor during the starvation period however the smp concentrations returned to their baseline values after one week of recovery and did not appear to influence the following filtration cycle while some temporary inconveniences occurred during the initial week of recovery no lasting harm was evident by the starvation period these results suggest that both the hmbr and mbr are viable options for certain decentralized

bulk density of the gac kg l 1 introduction wastewater released from an industry consist of a number of organic and inorganic pollutants these pollutants have some environmental effects in one or other ways therefore abatement of these pollutants from wastewater is essential before being released into the water bodies various physical and chemical techniques can be used for controlling the concentrations of these pollutants within allowable limits set by government bodies 1 3 adsorption process is one of the techniques for wastewater treatment this process has been used for water and wastewater treatment for long times and still used in industrial wastewater treatment among the adsorption processes continuous adsorption columns are widely used for wastewater treatment to control pollutant concentration levels 4 6 various kinds of adsorbents are used to serve this purpose among the adsorbents granular activated carbon gac is mostly used because of its high adsorption affinity towards almost all the pollutants 7 11 other popular adsorbents are rice husk ash 12 14 bagasse fly ash 4 10 silica based mesoporous materials 15 17 carbon nanotubes 11 18 19 jute fibers 2 20 and egg shells 21 adsorption affinity of gac is different for individual pollutants because of its surface functional group properties and chemical nature of pollutants formation of weak and strong bonding e g h bonding etc between the functional groups present on gac surface and pollutants chemical nature controls the surface affinity nature of adsorption sites may also be responsible for unequal affinity towards individual pollutants non conventional adsorbents such as algae has also been reported for heavy metals removal in a fluidized biosorption column with maximum removal efficiency of 89 and 70 for lead and arsenic respectively 22 numerous research papers have been reported on single and multicomponent adsorption onto various adsorbents both batch and continuous studies have been reported to have knowledge of adsorption isotherms properties and parameters adsorption parameters such as maximum equilibrium uptake and affinity constants are reported for various pollutants and adsorbents these parametric information and adsorption isotherms are very essential for design aspects the present work investigates the continuous simultaneous adsorption of aniline an and nitrobenzene nb fig 1 from their binary synthetic aqueous solution in packed column packed with granular activated carbon gac this is an extension of our recently published previous work which was on

environmental impact has been studied in detail by wang et al 26 in this manuscript we first present a new statistical approach for continuous simultaneous adsorption effect of column design parameters such as feed flow rate q bed height z and bed diameter d were studied for the breakthrough curve performance using taguchi s l9 orthogonal array design the parameters q z and d were optimized at three levels with the higher is better type response characteristics by means of only 9 sets of experiments further an empirical model based on the well known thomas model was proposed to

functional groups present on the gac surface were carboxyl oc o hydroxyl oh carbonyl c o and silanol si oh groups the thermal analysis such as tg dta and dtg of the virgin gac an loaded nb loaded and an nb loaded gac are shown in fig s3 the tg curves indicate that the moisture and the higher volatile compounds evolution take place 3 15 mass loss from 25 to 450 c drying or weight loss at higher temperature 100 450 c may be due to the release of surface bound moisture during the heating up to 400 c no phase change occurred which was confirmed by the unavailability of endothermic peak 27 the

the binary adsorption column performance represented by breakthrough curves are presented in fig 2 ebct is an important parameter in the design of adsorption column it affects the shape of the breakthrough curve and breakthrough volume vb ebct is defined as the ratio of the volume of gac in the column vc to the feed flow rate q 28 29 it is determined by eq 4 4 e b c t v c q a c z q adsorbent usage rate ur is defined as the saturated exhausted adsorbent mass behind one liter of treated wastewater the fixed bed adsorption column performance can also be assessed for adsorbent usage rate ur eq 5 5 u r m c v b v c Ï v c n b Ï n b table 3 shows the values of ebct tb vb ur and nb number of reactor volume treated at breakthrough and individual and total adsorbate uptake qi and qtot respectively are shown in table 4 these performance parameters were calculated at the breakthrough point from breakthrough curves fig 2 considering the breakthrough point at c c0 0 1 these experimental data show a decreasing trend of ur in general with an increase in ebct the column performance as represented in fig 2 a i implies that the breakthrough achieved earlier for higher q lower d and higher z value the increase in the mass transfer rate at higher q value increases the adsorbed amount of an and nb per unit height of bed within mass transfer zone and hence an increase in q leading to faster saturation the effect of column performance is better explained by equilibrium adsorption uptake of an and nb which is further correlated with saturation of sorption sites higher qi individual equilibrium adsorption uptake values are obtained for larger d and z values as can be observed in tables 4 and 5 higher d and z values increase the number of binding sites or sorption sites due to the fact that the higher amount of adsorbent gac increases the adsorption surface area sharper breakthrough curves were observed for an than nb which is the effect of competitive adsorption this can be further explained as the affinity of active sorption sites present on the gac surface towards a selective component and nb is the selective component in this case thus nb molecules outsmart an molecules in competition for a vacant site leading to sharper breakthrough curves for an it can also be concluded that the bed is better packed for thinner column diameter and helps in easier control of flow distribution 3 2 2 parameter optimization for binary column adsorption the effect of individual parameters q z and d on total equilibrium adsorption uptake qtot for the simultaneous removal of adsorbates from a binary system of an nb was studied the average values of qtot for each parameter at level 1 2 and 3 are given in table 5 parameter a q parameter b z and parameter c d has its maximum impact effect on response qtot at level 1 level 3 and level 2 respectively the relative influence of the effect as per doe in general is expressed by the difference between level 2 and level 1 l2 l1 of each factor the larger the difference the stronger is the influence table 6 implies that none of the single parameter has an intervening impact for the adsorption of an and nb from the an nb binary system no single parameter shows a strong influence on qtot value also fig 3 represents that the bed height has slightly higher predominance 39 on column performance the effect of adsorption parameters on individual qan and qnb average value of qtot and s n signal to noise ratio for the binary system are given in figs 4 and 5 an increase in the levels of factors from 1 to 2 and from 2 to 3 for q resulted in a decrease in the qnb value however the qan value increased from 1 to 2 and then decreased from 2 to 3 levels uptake of lesser attractive molecules an increased initially from level 1 to level 2 due to molecule hindrance and thereafter from level 2 to level 3 it started decreasing owing to competition between an and nb molecules the overall qtot value for the binary system decreased with an increase in q value it was also observed that an increase in z leads to an increase in qtot value further increase in d from l1 to l2 and l2 to l3 increased and decreased the qtot values respectively this may be due to the effect of packing efficiency the packing efficiency is lower for a larger diameter column owing to the compaction effect of the weight of the packing material gac the compaction effect reduces bed porosity leading to lower efficiency of the column the analysis of variance anova results for raw and signal to noise s n data are given in table 6 therefore after examining the response curves fig 5 the optimal level of various parameters obtained for an nb binary system indicated that 1st level of parameter a 3rd level of parameter b and 2nd level of parameter c provided the highest average value of qtot it revealed that the average qtot value should be highest for q flow rate 0 02 l min z bed height 60 cm and d diameter 2 54 cm to verify the optimal levels of parameters three confirmation experimental runs were conducted at selected optimal level the average qtot from the experimental runs was found to be 4 2 mg g which is closer to the predicted qtot value of 4 17 mg g tables s1 and s2 it may also be noted that these optimal values are valid within the specified range of process parameters 3 3 column modeling and data validation an empirical model was proposed to predict column breakthrough curve and breakthrough time for a binary adsorption eq 6 this model is a modified version of the thomas model 28 30 column performance in the form of breakthrough curves can be predicted by eq 4 experimental and predicted breakthrough curves are well matched as represented in fig 2 6 c c 0 i 1 j 1 n exp s i j k i j q o j m c q k i j c 0 j t t d j where n is number of components kij is rate constants l min mg of an and nb q0 j is the maximum solid phase concentration of component j mg g mc is the mass of adsorbent packed in the column g q is the volumetric flow rate l min c0 j is the initial concentration of component j c is the concentration of solute at time t min td j is the delayed time between the two breakthrough curves and sij is the adsorption competition coefficient of one component with respect to other and sii sjj 1 this term signifies the competitive adsorption of components onto the gac surface estimation of adsorption parameters was performed by data validation and are reported in table 7 calculated breakthrough times were comparable with the experimental values as reported in table 8 therefore we may conclude that the proposed model is satisfactory in predicting multicomponent breakthrough curves of a binary system well in advance for the scale up approach 4 conclusions sorption affinity of nb towards gac was observed to be higher than an resulting in larger breakthrough time of nb over an breakthrough curves for an were observed to be sharper than nb which was due to competitive adsorption among nb and an equilibrium individual adsorption uptake qi was found to be higher at larger column diameter and height this is because of increased surface area with an increased amount of adsorbent which resulted in larger binding sorption sites larger diameter column decreased the packing efficiency owing to the compaction effect of the mass of packing material i e gac compaction effect reduced bed porosity resulting in difficult control of flow distribution amongst all the parameters column height was observed to be the most predominant factor optimal process parameters were found to be bed diameter d 2 54 cm bed height z 60 cm and flow rate q 0 02 l min at this optimal condition the average qtot from the experimental runs was found to be 4 2 mg g which is closer to the predicted qtot value of 4 17 mg g furthermore column breakthrough curves were well predicted by the empirical proposed model and validated with experimental data of an nb binary system

bulk density of the gac kg l 1 introduction wastewater released from an industry consist of a number of organic and inorganic pollutants these pollutants have some environmental effects in one or other ways therefore abatement of these pollutants from wastewater is essential before being released into the water bodies various physical and chemical techniques can be used for controlling the concentrations of these pollutants within allowable limits set by government bodies 1 3 adsorption process is one of the techniques for wastewater treatment this process has been used for water and wastewater treatment for long times and still used in industrial wastewater treatment among the adsorption processes continuous adsorption columns are widely used for wastewater treatment to control pollutant concentration levels 4 6 various kinds of adsorbents are used to serve this purpose among the adsorbents granular activated carbon gac is mostly used because of its high adsorption affinity towards almost all the pollutants 7 11 other popular adsorbents are rice husk ash 12 14 bagasse fly ash 4 10 silica based mesoporous materials 15 17 carbon nanotubes 11 18 19 jute fibers 2 20 and egg shells 21 adsorption affinity of gac is different for individual pollutants because of its surface functional group properties and chemical nature of pollutants formation of weak and strong bonding e g h bonding etc between the functional groups present on gac surface and pollutants chemical nature controls the surface affinity nature of adsorption sites may also be responsible for unequal affinity towards individual pollutants non conventional adsorbents such as algae has also been reported for heavy metals removal in a fluidized biosorption column with maximum removal efficiency of 89 and 70 for lead and arsenic respectively 22 numerous research papers have been reported on single and multicomponent adsorption onto various adsorbents both batch and continuous studies have been reported to have knowledge of adsorption isotherms properties and parameters adsorption parameters such as maximum equilibrium uptake and affinity constants are reported for various pollutants and adsorbents these parametric information and adsorption isotherms are very essential for design aspects the present work investigates the continuous simultaneous adsorption of aniline an and nitrobenzene nb fig 1 from their binary synthetic aqueous solution in packed column packed with granular activated carbon gac this is an extension of our recently published previous work which was on simultaneous batch adsorption study of an and nb using gac 9 petrochemicals dyes and dyeing pharmaceutical and explosive manufacturing industries are the sources of generation of an and nb 9 23 24 nb and an has been reported to be carcinogenic and if inhaled convert hemoglobin into methemoglobin preventing oxygen uptake in the body 25 the effect of these compounds on living species with environmental impact has been studied in detail by wang et al 26 in this manuscript we first present a new statistical approach for continuous simultaneous adsorption effect of column design parameters such as feed flow rate q bed height z and bed diameter d were studied for the breakthrough curve performance using taguchi s l9 orthogonal array design the parameters q z and d were optimized at three levels with the higher is better type response characteristics by means of only 9 sets of experiments further an empirical model based on the well known thomas model was proposed to predict column breakthrough curve and breakthrough time 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and characterization aniline an and nitrobenzene nb of analytical grade were procured from s d fine

dta thermal analyzer sii 6300 exstar in the oxidizing atmosphere zero air with a dynamic heating rate of 10 c min 2 2 experimental set up continuous adsorption of an and nb were carried out in plexiglass columns of different diameters d 2 2 54 and 4 cm bed height z 30 45 and 60 cm and feed flowrate q 0 02 0 04 and 0 06 l min all the experiments were conducted at room temperature 30 c and the an and nb binary solution ph was maintained at 6 8 using buffer solution 9 fig s1 represents a pictorial diagram of the adsorption column filled with gac particles of size 1 5 mm binary solution of an and nb was fed from the bottom of the column and the samples were collected at 30 45 and 60 cm height from the bottom in order to distribute feed solution uniformly across the bed cross section glass beads 0 3 0 5 cm diameter of approximately 5 cm height was filled just above the feed port of the column a peristaltic pump miclins pp20 was used to maintain a constant feed flow rate during the experiments the treated samples were collected at various pre decided sampling ports of the column at different time t interval further the collected samples were analyzed by double beam uv vis spectrophotometer model uv 210 a shimadzu kyoto japan to determine the residual concentration of an and nb for this purpose eq s 1 and 2 generated from the calibration of an and nb were applied to

already been described in our previous work for batch adsorption 4 10 14 for the optimization of various parameters in binary adsorption of an and nb taguchi s l9 34 orthogonal array oa matrix was used three process parameters q z and d have been considered for optimization of the simultaneous adsorption of an and nb in continuous column adsorption these process parameters along with their

been published elsewhere 9 only the key characteristics are presented here the bulk density and bet surface area were found to be 661 8 kg m3 and 183 5 m2 g respectively the xrd fig s2 confirmed the occurrence of akdalaite fersilicate moganite and tamarugite al2o3 4 h2o fesi sio2 and naal so4 2 6h2o respectively the qualitative chemical surface properties were measured by ftir analysis the major functional groups present on the gac surface were carboxyl oc o hydroxyl oh carbonyl c o and silanol si oh groups the thermal analysis such as tg dta and dtg of the virgin gac an loaded nb loaded and an nb loaded gac are shown in fig s3 the tg curves indicate that the moisture and the higher volatile compounds evolution take place 3 15 mass loss from 25 to 450 c drying or weight loss at higher temperature 100 450 c may be due to the release of surface bound moisture during the heating up to 400 c no phase change occurred which was confirmed by the unavailability of endothermic peak 27 the decrease in mass loss rate was found to be 31 wt within 450 640 c for blank gac 40 wt within 450 650 c for an gac 49 wt within 450 610 c for nb gac and 54 wt within 450 656 c for an nb gac the blank an loaded nb loaded and an nb loaded gac get oxidized in the temperature range of 450 660 c with gradual weight loss a strong exothermic peak between 450 700 c exposed the oxidative degradation followed by the carbon combustion all the samples showed a gradual weight loss up to 1000 c due to the evolution of co2 co and traces amount of nox the main variation in the thermal degradation

finally the ash remained after third mass degradation zone in gac an gac nb gac and an nb gac was found to be 65 6 48 2 36 and 38 5 respectively 3 2 column performance and parameter optimization the column adsorption performance has been studied for the removal of an and nb from synthetic wastewater by varying values of three parameters q d and z the column performance is generally represented by concentration c c0 vs time t curve also known as breakthrough curve experimental plan for this binary adsorption was decided as per the design of experiment doe procedure based on taguchi s optimization method table 2 3 2 1 effect of process parameters using taguchi s optimization method total nine runs were performed as suggested by taguchi s l9 orthogonal array oa matrix table 2 and the binary adsorption column performance represented by breakthrough curves are presented in fig 2 ebct is an important parameter in the design of adsorption column it affects the shape of the breakthrough curve and breakthrough volume vb ebct is defined as the ratio of the volume of gac in the column vc to the feed flow rate q 28 29 it is determined by eq 4 4 e b c t v c q a c z q adsorbent usage rate ur is defined as the saturated exhausted adsorbent mass behind one liter of treated wastewater the fixed bed adsorption column performance can also be assessed for adsorbent usage rate ur eq 5 5 u r m c v b v c Ï v c n b Ï n b table 3 shows the values of ebct tb vb ur and nb number of reactor volume treated at breakthrough and individual and total adsorbate uptake qi and qtot respectively are shown in table 4 these performance parameters were calculated at the breakthrough point from breakthrough curves fig 2 considering the breakthrough point at c c0 0 1 these experimental data show a decreasing trend of ur in general with an increase in ebct the column performance as represented in fig 2 a i implies that the breakthrough achieved earlier for higher q lower d and higher z value the increase in the mass transfer rate at higher q value increases the adsorbed amount of an and nb per unit height of bed within mass transfer zone and hence an increase in q leading to faster saturation the effect of column performance is better explained by equilibrium adsorption uptake of an and nb which is further correlated with saturation of sorption sites higher qi individual equilibrium adsorption uptake values are obtained for larger d and z values as can be observed in tables 4 and 5 higher d and z values increase the number of binding sites or sorption sites due to the fact that the higher amount of adsorbent gac increases the adsorption surface area sharper breakthrough curves were observed for an than nb which is the effect of competitive adsorption this can be further explained as the affinity of active sorption sites present on the gac surface towards a selective component and nb is the selective component in this case thus nb molecules outsmart an molecules in competition for a vacant site leading to sharper breakthrough curves for an it can also be concluded that the bed is better packed for thinner column diameter and helps in easier control of flow distribution 3 2 2 parameter optimization for binary column adsorption the effect of individual parameters q z and d on total equilibrium adsorption uptake qtot for the simultaneous removal of adsorbates from a binary system of an nb was studied the average values of qtot for each parameter at level 1 2 and 3 are given in table 5 parameter a q parameter b z and parameter c d has its maximum impact effect on response qtot at level 1 level 3 and level 2 respectively the relative influence of the effect as per doe in general is expressed by the difference between level 2 and level 1 l2 l1 of each factor the larger the difference the stronger is the influence table 6 implies that none of the single parameter has an intervening impact for the adsorption of an and nb from the an nb binary system no single parameter shows a strong influence on qtot value also fig 3 represents that the bed height has slightly higher predominance 39 on column performance the effect of adsorption parameters on individual qan and qnb average value of qtot and s n signal to noise ratio for the binary system are given in figs 4 and 5 an increase in the levels of factors from 1 to 2 and from 2 to 3 for q resulted in a decrease in the qnb value however the qan value increased from 1 to 2 and then decreased from 2 to 3 levels uptake of lesser attractive molecules an increased initially from level 1 to level 2 due to molecule hindrance and thereafter from level 2 to level 3 it started decreasing owing to competition between an and nb molecules the overall qtot value for the binary system decreased with an increase in q value it was also observed that an increase in z leads to an increase in qtot value further increase in d from l1 to l2 and l2 to l3 increased and decreased the qtot values respectively this may be due to the effect of packing efficiency the packing efficiency is lower for a larger diameter column owing to the compaction effect of the weight of the packing material gac the compaction effect reduces bed porosity leading to lower efficiency of the column the analysis of variance anova results for raw and signal to noise s n data are given in table 6 therefore after examining the response curves fig 5 the optimal level of various parameters obtained for an nb binary system indicated that 1st level of parameter a 3rd level of parameter b and 2nd level of parameter c provided the highest average value of qtot it revealed that the average qtot value should be highest for q flow rate 0 02 l min z bed height 60 cm and d diameter 2 54 cm to verify the optimal levels of parameters three confirmation experimental runs were conducted at selected optimal level the average qtot from the experimental runs was found to be 4 2 mg g which is closer to the predicted qtot value of 4 17 mg g tables s1 and s2 it may also be noted that these optimal values are valid within the specified range of process parameters 3 3 column modeling and data validation an empirical model was proposed to predict column breakthrough curve and breakthrough time for a binary adsorption eq 6 this model is a modified version of the thomas model 28 30 column performance in the form of breakthrough curves can be predicted by eq 4 experimental and predicted breakthrough curves are well matched as represented in fig 2 6 c c 0 i 1 j 1 n exp

the two breakthrough curves and sij is the adsorption competition coefficient of one component with respect to other and sii sjj 1 this term signifies the competitive adsorption of components onto the gac surface estimation of adsorption parameters was performed by data validation and are reported in table 7 calculated breakthrough times were comparable with the experimental values as reported in table 8 therefore we may conclude that the proposed model is satisfactory in predicting multicomponent breakthrough curves of a binary system well in advance for the scale up approach 4 conclusions sorption affinity of nb towards gac was observed to be higher than an resulting in larger breakthrough time of nb over an breakthrough curves for an were observed to be sharper than nb which was due to competitive adsorption among nb and an equilibrium individual adsorption uptake qi was found to be higher at larger column diameter and height this is because of increased surface area with an increased amount of adsorbent which resulted in larger binding sorption sites larger diameter column decreased the packing efficiency owing to the compaction effect of the mass of packing material i e gac compaction effect reduced bed porosity resulting in difficult control of flow distribution amongst all the parameters column height was observed to be the most predominant factor optimal process parameters were found to be bed diameter d 2 54 cm bed height z 60 cm and flow rate q 0 02 l min at this optimal condition the average qtot from the experimental runs was found to be 4 2 mg g which is closer to the predicted qtot value of 4 17 mg g furthermore column breakthrough curves were well predicted by the empirical proposed model and validated with experimental data of an nb binary system

materials such as adaptability and flexibility in design thermostability transparency low cost and easy to handle in particular the consumption of polyethylene terephthalate pet has recorded as the fastest growth rate in the global plastic market due to the continuous growth of the pet bottle market nowadays pet products have posed a problem of substantial concern and presented as a direct warning to the environment due to the large amount of its waste with low bio and photo degradability that represented a serious problem for countries world wide the most common ways to eliminate pet waste are incineration and recycling meanwhile the waste of plastic can provide a carbon source for carbon based value added products such as hydrocarbons carbon black activated carbon carbon fibers fullerenes carbon nanotubes and graphene therefore the conversion of plastic wastes into such value added products is an excellent example of upcycling on the other hand the industrialization development have significantly exploited aquatic resources for instance industrial effluents loaded with many harmful materials which are not only toxic to the aquatic life but also to the human beings industrial dyes are generally used in paper textile plastic printing food cosmetic and carpet industries 1 3 however the effluents containing dyes have a serious effect on the water ecological balance because they have high stability to photochemical chemical and biological degradation and thus blocks the solar radiations from reaching to the depth water which results in a decrease in the dissolved oxygen concentration and hence affecting the aquatic life which in turn affecting human race dyes are consisting of various groups such as basic acid cationic reactive and nonionic disperse dyes 4 5 the conventional technologies for treating polluted water include photocatalysis degradation 6 7 nanofiltration 8 ozonation 9 anodic oxidation 10 electrocoagulation 10 and biodegradation 11

fmfnc was collected using an external magnet then dispersed into 50 ml of 1 m hcl for the cationic dye or a solution of 1 m naoh with methanol for the anionic dye then the solutions were ultrasonically treated at room temperature for 30 min after that the adsorbent was collected washed and dried in an oven at 60 c for 12 h then reused ten cyclic adsorption desorption processes were conducted to study the regenerability 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation mechanism of the prepared fmfnc as shown in fig 1 fmfnc was synthesized via a facile one step and green synthesis route using catalytic thermal decomposition of pet bottle wastes as a precursor and ferrocene as a catalyst and precursor for magnatic nanoparticals in the composite for removal of ab25 or mb dye by adsoption process and then separated easily by an external magnet ferrocene c5h5 2 fe has a sandwich structure with an iron in the center it begins to decompose thermally at 175 c and could decompose completely to form metallic iron and reactive hydrocarbons gases at 500 c 19 that represents as follow 13 fe c5h5 2 fe h2 ch4 c5h6 upon formed iron clusters and reactive carbon in the gas phase act as catalyst nuclei in the formation of fullerene cage 20 21 however the presence of magnetite nanoparticles on the fullerene cage limits its aggregation phenomenon thereby kept the fullerenes in dispersed form and subsequently increased the surface area of the fmfnc 22 23 3 2 characteristics of the prepared fmfnc as shown in fig 2 a the tem image was confirmed coexist of multishell fullerenes with low amount of graphene sheets to explore the composition of the synthesized fmfnc energy dispersive x ray edax was used to analyze the elemental composition fig 2 b and the results showed that the obtained fmfnc was formed with high quantity of carbon and low amount of oxygen and traces of iron and that confirmed from xps survey spectra as shown in fig 2 c the xps survey spectra was attributed to the surface composition of o1s and c1s peaks at 532 1 and 284 4 ev respectively 24 in addition to peaks at 700 and 725 ev corresponding to the binding energy of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively 25 these peaks indictaed that the fmfnc composite mainly contained fe o c elements howevere the high resolution fe 2p spectral peaks are assigned to three peaks inset in fig 2 c the spectral peak at 708 6 711 88 and 718 44 were typical fe 2 fe 3 and fe0 respectively 26 the surface composition of fmfnc and the variation of nature of the surface groups is summarized at table 1 all these results were accordance with the xrd results edx and xps results proving that the magnatic nanoparticals are successfully loaded on fullerene supports as shown in fig 3 a the xrd pattern of fmfnc exhibits diffraction peaks 002 101 and 004 belonging to the formation of fullerene icdd card no 00 056 0159 in addition to series of characteristic peaks 220 311 511 and 440 which are in well accordance with the inverse cubic spinel phase of fe3o4 icdd card no 01 07 5088 generally the decomposition temperature of iron carbide is 700 c while the formation of fe at high temperature is obtained via reduction of fe3o4 to feo and then fe 27 so no iron carbide phase was observed the raman spectrum of fmfnc was shown in fig 3 b g mode arising from the first order scattering of fullerene sp2 atoms was observed at 1596 cm 1 in addition to d mode at 1360 cm 1 which assigned to the vibration of carbon atoms with hanging bonds for the in plane completed disordered graphite component however a band that appeared at 2658 cm 1 is a signature of the formation of large domain size graphitic sp2 materials and is called the g band or 2d 28 in the region 2500 to 4000 cm 1 there was no raman lines originating from fullerene however in the region 2700 to 3000 cm 1 a complex overlap of raman lines was exhibited and that was originated from oh stretching and that could has a benefit in the adsorption characteristics the intensity ratio id ig used to count the relative levels of disorder and it is a good indicator for the sample quality 29 the id ig for fmfnc was 1 11 and that attributed to an increase in the amount of sp2 hybridized carbons including fullerene sp2 carbons the raman spectrum of iron oxides with the main three bands at 371 501 and 678 cm 1 which assigned to fe o stretching vibrations was not observed and that was an indication for low content of iron oxide presented in the composite compared to carbon content 30 fig 3 c shows the corecivity hc saturation magnetization ms and remenant magnetization mr for fmfnc 0 0394 koe 7 002 emu g and 0 8331 emu g respectively and it was concluded from the value of ms and complete reversibility of the m h curve that the prepared fmfnc has superparamagnetic property 31 and its low magnetization value could be attributed to the formation of unactive magnetic layer of carbon over the surface of magnatic nanoparticles which hinder the magnitude or uniformity of magnetization due to quenching of surface moments 32 however this magnetization characterstic has a favourable impact on the adsorption process on two ways firstly it inhibits aggregation of fmfnc secondly make it able to re disperse again when magnetic field is removed 3 3 the statistical analysis by rsm the adsorption performance of the adsorbent was affected by various single dependant variables such as contact time initial dye concentration adsorbent dosage solution temperature and ph were shown in fig s1 box behnken experimental design was employed to optimize the adsorption process using three independent variables the three independent variables are time min represented by x1 initial dye concentration ppm represented by x2 and solution temperture oc represented by x3 the quadratic model explained the statistical relationship between the selected variables and the response in terms of coded factors was best fitted with the following equations 14 ymb 96 08 1 1275 1 4 55375 2 0 92375 3 0 02125 1x1 1 87375 2x2 1 02625 3 3 0 59 1 2 0 4725 2 3 0 1 15 yab25 92 97 2 79125 1 22 9175 2 1 63625 3 1 62 1x1 18

parameter and their interaction on the response the comparison between the observed and predicted values in table 2 can express a good correlation between the observed and predicted values of the removal efficiency of mb and ab25 dye as illustrated in tables 2 and s2 of model validations the agreement between the obtained and estimated removal efficiency showed that using response surface method to design the experiments could be considered as an effective choice for the optimization of process parameters besides its uses as an experimental design and statistical analysis the high value of the adjusted regression coefficient 0 976778 and 0 996636 for mb and ab25 respectively implicates to the significance of the model parameters the high r2 values indicated that the predicted response was close to the experimental values and the models were suitable to correlate with the experimental data therefore the r2 showed good agreement between experimental data analysis of variance anova was applied to examine the model presented table s3 and s4 for mb and ab25 respectively the low probability with f value implied that the model demonstrated by the value of the lack of fit 33 these results were not random and the term model had a significant effect to the response from the tables s3 and s4 model f value of 57 08457 and 396 0639 and value prob f of 0 003391 and 0 000189 for mb and ab25 respectively implies the model was significant the results of the box behnken design could be presented in 3d presentations with contours the 3d surface plots showed a type of interaction between the tested variables which allowed obtaining the optimum conditions 34 fig 4 a and b indicates the simultaneous effect of contact time and dye concentration on dye removal efficiency for prepared fmfnc the dyes removal efficiency decreased with an increase in dyes concentration from 50 to 150 mg l 1 and the maximum dye removal efficiency was obtained with 50 mg l 1 initial concentration for mb and 70 mg l 1 for ab25 as shown it was observed from fig 4 a d an increase in the dye removal efficiency was occurred with the contact time increasing then remained approximately constant after 45 min this remark exposed that in the start the dye molecules are adsorbed externally and the adsorption rate improved rapidly when the external surface became saturated the dye molecules adsorbed into the porous structure of the fmfnc then finally at some point in time reached a constant value where no more dye was adsorbed from the solution the fitted surface plots of dye separation efficiency versus the combined effect of co and t were also shown in fig 4 e and f however by investigating the combined influences of co and t on dye uptake efficiency it was realized that when the co was low the optimum temperature was obtained at lower degree probably due to the existence of a smaller number of dye molecules in the solution to be adsorbed but at high concentrated solutions the effect of heating was less efficient 3 4 kinetics isotherms and thermodynamics studies 3 4 1 kinetic study from fig s2 the calculated dye sorption capacities the reaction rate constants and the linear correlation coefficients r2 values for the different studied co were studied in table 3 and fig s3 as can be seen the r2 values obtained from pseud second order are reliably higher than those from the pseudo first order meaning that the controlling rate step is chemisorption this seems to involve valence forces through chemical reaction or electrostatic interaction between dye molecules and fmfnc 18 in addition the qe calculated values were in a harmony with the experimental qe values qe exp moreover the results showed that the rate of adsorption for both dyes based on the accessibility of active sites on the surface of fmfnc whereas the co enhanced the k2 values was declined this could be due to the higher competition for the adsorption active sites at high co compared to low co 35 although the pseudo second order kinetics has the best fitted order the obtained results from this model were not efficient to test the diffusion mechanism of mb and ab25 onto fmfnc as shown in fig 5 the linear fitting results of the adsorption process were in conformity with the intraparticle diffusion model at the first step the external surface adsorption was arisen at the outer materials surfaces that was followed by the second step which was governed by intraparticle diffusion it was the gradual adsorption step lastly the third step was the slowest step which denoted the final equilibrium step as listed in table 4 ki was improved with enhanced co as a result of the fact that multitude dye molecules interacted with active sites on fmfnc which cause high adsorption intensity at a high co for all co ki 1 are larger than ki 2 which indicate the free path available for diffusion became smaller and the pore dimensions decreased 36 while the ki 3 was significantly lower than the others which confirmed that the third step was the slowest step 3 4 2 adsorption isotherms according to the correlation coefficients and parameter values which summarized in table 5 the r2 values of langmuir model were very close to 1 and larger than that of freundlich model which suggestes that the adsorption process is a process occurs in a homogeneous surface thus with the consideration of r 2 and the error functions it was concluded that the langmuir model best represented the adsorption data which indicated that there is no transmission of dye in the plane of the surface as well as the uniform adsorption energies and that confirm the ion exchange mechanism is predominated through this process 37 the high adsorption capacity proved that the strong electrostatic interaction between dye molecules and fmfnc bending sites 38 in addition the values of rl at low temperatures were higher than those at high temperatures as shown in fig 6 the values of rl were between 0 and 1 which indicate that the adsorption of dye tends to be chemical rather than physical in nature it can be inferred that the adsorption behavior was more effective at high temperatures and the adsorption process was more irreversible 39 from freundlich model the values of 1 n f which estimates the adsorption intensity or surface heterogeneity that values between 0 and 1 it elucidates more heterogeneity as the values get near to zero however the results also indicated that adsorption of both dyes onto fmfnc was favorable using freundlich isotherm model 3 4 3 adsorption thermodynamics the thermodynamic parameters were illustrated in table 6 the negative values of Î´g showed that dyes and fmfnc systems were spontaneous furthermore the decine in the values of Î´g with increasing of temperature showed by clear evidence that the adsorption is more spontaneous at higher temperatures the positive values of Î´h indicate the endothermic nature of the process and strong electrostatic interaction between fmfnc and dye molecules however the low Î´h values confirmed the weak interactions between mb or ab25 molecules and the surface hydroxyl groups of fmfnc 4 39 on the other hand the positive values of Î´s indicate enhancement in randomness at the solid liquid interface during the adsorption process however the positive values of Î´s can be demonstrated to the result of solvent replacement phenomenon where the dye molecules need to replace the water molecules on the surface of fmfnc in order to be adsorbed 38 3 5 an exploratory adsorption study using ft ir and adsorption mechansim the ftir spectra and assignments of its bands of the prepared fmfnc before and after adsorption was shown in fig 7 and table s5 respectively the conversion of pet waste to fullerene and the presence of the oxygen containing functional moieties in fullerene that can be confirmed due to the presence of broad band around 1650 cm 1 corresponding to stretching carbonyl group co and cc vibration while the broad band at 1095 cm 1 which was ascribed to the intrinsic characteristic of sp2 graphitic materials and oxygen functionalities of skeletal stretching vibration of c o group 39 it indicates that the oxidation of fullerene cages was occurred without any solvent these two bands suggesting strong electronic interaction between the two moieties in ground state at the edges of the fullerene networks 40 41 the broad peak at 3441 cm 1 representing oh stretching vibration of hydroxyl functional groups thus showing the presence of free hydroxyl groups on the surface of fmfnc these new chemical bonds of oh co and c o clearly prove that oxidation of the fullerene cages during the reaction is occurring the broad peaks with low intensity indicates that the fullerene was attached to magnetic nanoparticles 42 it can be seen that the broad bands at 638 610 and 560 cm 1 for fmfnc and that with mb and ab25 adsorbed dyes respectively were corresponds to fe o stretching vibration mode of magnetite that attached with fullerene 43 after adsorption many significant differences have occurred for the prepared fmfnc for instance there were distinct and significant changes in the adsorption band density of oh cc and co suggesting that such ionizable functional groups on the adsorbent surface were able to interact and bind with the dye molecule also the mechanism of adsorption could be deduced on its dependent on such functional groups specially the hydroxyl group the changes in the ftir spectrum were the evidence of the formation of structures containing multiple carbon carbon bonds as well as the elimination of originally present oxygen and hydrogen atoms in addition a red shift of all bands was observed after adsorption as well as the observed hydroxyl release especially for ab25 adsorbed during the batch adsorption experiment which indicated that the oxygen groups of fullerene reacted with the surface sites of magnetite probably through ligand exchange mechanism 44 also fullerene can be immobilized through ligand exchange with surface hydroxyl groups of magnetite and through anion exchange obviously the characteristic band of oh at 3393 cm 1 for fmfnc ab25 has higher intensity as compared to its parent fmfnc and fmfnc mb which indicate that the chemical reaction occurred between hydroxide radical on the surface of fmfnc and amine group in ab25 dye and subsequently enhances the adsorption capacity of fmfnc moreover it was revealed that oxygen group probably reacte with the surface sites of fullerene and fe3o4 through ligand exchange mechanism in case of anionic dye such as ab25 dye or electrostatic interaction in case of cationic dye such as mb dye 44 45 there is a linkage between each adsorption mechanism and various functional groups in fmfnc modes of interaction of fmfnc with cationic and anionic dye are shown in fig 8 there are three modes of adsorption mechanisms as follow i the electrostatic interaction between positively charged mb dye and negatively charged group carbon especially with the presence of functional groups on the other hands the surface of carbon is variable charged and strongly depends on the ionization of surface of carbon depending on the ph so it may be occure the electrostatic interaction between positive charge of carbon at fnmfnc and negative charged of ab25 dye ii the Ï Ï sbonding takes place between bulk Ï system of carbon in fmfnc and dye molecules with cc or benzene rings and iii the hydrogen bonding is formed between the functional groups such as cooh and oh on the surface of fmfnc and dye molecules 3 6 regeneration ability the ability of fmfnc to be regenerated is an important factor to estimate its cost effectiveness as shown in fig 9 after ten cycles the removal efficiency was still high and the decrease in the removal percentage were quite small after each desorption process thus these results confirm the high recyclability and stability potential of the prepared fmfnc for cationic and anionic dyes adsorption after its regeneration in conclusion the prepared fmfnc is considered as an economic and efficient adsorbent agent which is vital for an industrial and large scale practical applications after ten cycles the porous texture of the used fmfnc is analysed by nitrogen adsorption desorption and pore size distributions fig 10 in fig 10 a fmfnc samples before and after the ten cycles of adsorption show the characteristics of microporous materials with iv type isotherm with hysteresis loop p po 0 4 which indicate that the existance of a well organized microporous structure with main contribution of mesoporosity and these characteristic is favourable for the adsorption process after adsorption of ten cycles there is remarkable of decrease of n2 adsorption indicating that the porous structure of fmfnc has been partially blocked by the incorporation of dye molecules from the adsorption branch of isotherm the specific surface area was decreased from 474 m2 g before adsorption to 360 27 and 139 04 m2 g after ten cycles of adsorption of ab25 and mb respectively the size distributions of fmfnc before and after ten cycles of adsorption are shown in fig 10 b it can be seen that the fmfnc possess large amounts of micropores in their structure and pores disappeared after ab25 or mb adsorption which could be regarded that as an evidence of the micropore occupation by ab25 or mb dye molecules 46 the large surface area and low pore diameter of fmfnc should gurantee its adsorption performance for cationic and anionic dyes in water 4 conclusions this study involved the synthesis of functionalized magnetic fullerenes via one step catalytic thermal dissociation of pet bottle wastes this method is solvent free simple fast economic controllable and environmentally friendly interestingly it was found that the prepared material has relatively high surface area with mesopores and micropore volumes in addition to superparamagnetic property also fmfnc showed a good performance in the adsorption of ab25 or mb dye after ten successive cycles the combination of fullerene with magnetic nanoparticles merge the advantage of high adsorption capacity and separation convenience whereas the prepared fmfnc would be promising adsorbent for removal of mb and ab25 dyes in terms of high efficiency stability

attained mainly via electrostatic interaction Ï Ï stacking interaction and hydrogen bonding the wastes treat wastes idea was used to purify dye contaminated wastewater and it was found that the obtained fmfnc can be used as a promising alternative prospect of cheap adsorbent materials keywords upcycling magnetic fullerene functionalization mechanism formation dye adsorption 1 introduction from the beginning of the last century plastics become to be an essential part of our daily life and their consumption has grown severely over years due to it has many benefits to combat other materials such as adaptability and flexibility in design thermostability transparency low cost and easy to handle in particular the consumption of polyethylene terephthalate pet has recorded as the fastest growth rate in the global plastic market due to the continuous growth of the pet bottle market nowadays pet products have posed a problem of substantial concern and presented as a direct warning to the environment due to the large amount of its waste with low bio and photo degradability that represented a serious problem for countries world wide the most common ways to eliminate pet waste are incineration and recycling meanwhile the waste of plastic can provide a carbon source for carbon based value added products such as hydrocarbons carbon black activated carbon carbon fibers fullerenes carbon nanotubes and graphene therefore the conversion of plastic wastes into such value added products is an excellent example of upcycling on the other hand the industrialization development have significantly exploited aquatic resources for instance industrial effluents loaded with many harmful materials which are not only toxic to the aquatic life but also to the human beings industrial dyes are generally used in paper textile plastic printing food cosmetic and carpet industries 1 3 however the effluents containing dyes have a serious effect on the water ecological balance because they have high stability to photochemical chemical and biological degradation and thus blocks the solar radiations from reaching to the depth water which results in a decrease in the dissolved oxygen concentration and hence affecting the aquatic life which in turn affecting human race dyes are consisting of various groups such as basic acid cationic reactive and nonionic disperse dyes 4 5 the conventional technologies for treating polluted water include photocatalysis degradation 6 7 nanofiltration 8 ozonation 9 anodic oxidation 10 electrocoagulation 10 and biodegradation 11 among these techniques adsorption technology is suitable for dye decolorization due to its merits of efficiency affordability recovery reusability and simplicity of operation 12 15 carbon nanomaterials are the most widely used as adsorbents due to their simple production low cost high availability excellent adsorption capacity and easy regeneration one of unique and new form of existence carbon nano materials as an adsorbent is fullerene which has zero dimensional structure and it was discovered by american chemists in the mid 1980s however fullerenes family composed of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms arranged in closed hollow cages as pentagons and hexagons structures they lie on the boundary between molecules and nanomaterials and known as the smallest stable carbon nanostructures while c60 is the most popular one in this family 16 17 based on previously mentioned environmental problems we are motivated by the desire to present applicable solutions to these problems this study produces green simple economical synthesis for functionalized magnetic fullerene nanocomposites fmfnc by catalytic thermal decomposition of pet bottles as a low valued waste materials this advanced material will be evaluated as a potential adsorbent for anionic and cationic dyes using several batch experiments combined with response surface methodology rsm model

using catalytic thermal decomposition of pet bottle wastes as a precursor and ferrocene as a catalyst and precursor for magnatic nanoparticals in the composite for removal of ab25 or mb dye by adsoption process and then separated easily by an external magnet ferrocene c5h5 2 fe has a sandwich structure with an iron in the center it begins to decompose thermally at 175 c and could decompose

catalyst nuclei in the formation of fullerene cage 20 21 however the presence of magnetite nanoparticles on the fullerene cage limits its aggregation phenomenon thereby kept the fullerenes in dispersed form and subsequently increased the surface area of the fmfnc 22 23 3 2 characteristics of the prepared fmfnc as shown in fig 2 a the tem image was confirmed coexist of multishell fullerenes with low amount of graphene sheets to explore the composition of the synthesized fmfnc energy dispersive x ray edax was used to analyze the elemental composition fig 2 b and the results showed that the obtained fmfnc was formed with high quantity of carbon and low amount of oxygen and traces of iron and that confirmed from xps survey spectra as shown in fig 2 c the xps survey spectra was attributed to the surface composition of o1s and c1s peaks at 532 1 and 284 4 ev respectively 24 in addition to peaks at 700 and 725 ev corresponding to the binding energy of fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively 25 these peaks indictaed that the fmfnc composite mainly contained fe o c elements howevere the high resolution fe 2p spectral peaks are assigned to three peaks inset in fig 2 c the spectral peak at 708 6 711 88 and 718 44 were typical fe 2 fe 3 and fe0 respectively 26 the surface composition of fmfnc and the variation of nature of the surface groups is summarized at table 1 all these results were accordance with the xrd results edx and xps results proving that the magnatic nanoparticals are successfully loaded on fullerene supports as shown in fig 3 a the xrd pattern of fmfnc exhibits diffraction peaks 002 101 and 004 belonging to the formation of fullerene icdd card no 00 056 0159 in addition to series of characteristic peaks 220 311 511 and 440 which are in well accordance with the inverse cubic spinel phase of fe3o4 icdd card no 01 07 5088 generally the decomposition temperature of iron carbide is 700 c while the formation of fe at high temperature is obtained via reduction of fe3o4 to feo and then fe 27 so no iron carbide phase was observed the raman spectrum of fmfnc was shown in fig 3 b g mode arising from the first order scattering of fullerene sp2 atoms was observed at 1596 cm 1 in addition to d mode at 1360 cm 1 which assigned to the vibration of carbon atoms with hanging bonds for the in plane completed disordered graphite component however a band that appeared at 2658 cm 1 is a signature of the formation of large domain size graphitic sp2 materials and is called the g band or 2d 28 in the region 2500 to 4000 cm 1 there was no raman lines originating from fullerene however in the region 2700 to 3000 cm 1 a complex overlap of raman lines was exhibited and that was originated from oh stretching and that could has a benefit in the adsorption characteristics the intensity ratio id ig used to count the relative levels of disorder and it is a good indicator for the sample quality 29 the id ig for fmfnc was 1 11 and that attributed to an increase in the amount of sp2 hybridized carbons including fullerene sp2 carbons the raman spectrum of iron oxides with the main three bands at 371 501 and 678 cm 1 which assigned to fe o stretching vibrations was not observed and that was an indication for low content of iron oxide presented in the composite compared to carbon content 30 fig 3 c shows the corecivity hc saturation magnetization ms and remenant magnetization mr for fmfnc 0 0394 koe 7 002 emu g and 0 8331 emu g respectively and it was concluded from the value of ms and complete reversibility of the m h curve that the prepared fmfnc has superparamagnetic property 31 and its low magnetization value could be attributed to the formation of unactive magnetic layer of carbon over the surface of magnatic nanoparticles which hinder the magnitude or uniformity of magnetization due to quenching of surface moments 32 however this magnetization characterstic has a favourable impact on the adsorption process on two ways firstly it inhibits aggregation of fmfnc secondly make it able to re disperse again when magnetic field is removed 3 3 the statistical analysis by rsm the adsorption performance of the adsorbent was affected by various single dependant variables such as contact time initial dye concentration adsorbent dosage solution temperature and ph were shown in fig s1 box behnken experimental design was employed to optimize the adsorption process using three independent variables the three independent variables are time min represented by x1 initial dye concentration ppm represented by x2 and solution temperture oc represented by x3 the quadratic model explained the statistical relationship between the selected variables and the response in terms of coded factors was best fitted with the following equations 14 ymb 96 08 1 1275 1 4 55375 2 0 92375 3 0 02125 1x1 1 87375 2x2 1 02625 3 3 0 59 1 2 0 4725 2 3 0 1 15 yab25 92 97 2 79125 1 22 9175 2 1 63625 3 1 62 1x1 18

parameter and their interaction on the response the comparison between the observed and predicted values in table 2 can express a good correlation between the observed and predicted values of the removal efficiency of mb and ab25 dye as illustrated in tables 2 and s2 of model validations the agreement between the obtained and estimated removal efficiency showed that using response surface method to design the experiments could be considered as an effective choice for the optimization of process parameters besides its uses as an experimental design and statistical analysis the high value of the adjusted regression coefficient 0 976778 and 0 996636 for mb and ab25 respectively implicates to the significance of the model parameters the high r2 values indicated that the predicted response was close to the experimental values and the models were suitable to correlate with the experimental data therefore the r2 showed good agreement between experimental data analysis of variance anova was applied to examine the model presented table s3 and s4 for mb and ab25 respectively the low probability with f value implied that the model demonstrated by the value of the lack of fit 33 these results were not random and the term model had a significant effect to the response from the tables s3 and s4 model f value of 57 08457 and 396 0639 and value prob f of 0 003391 and 0 000189 for mb and ab25 respectively implies the model was significant the results of the box behnken design could be presented in 3d presentations with contours the 3d surface plots showed a type of interaction between the tested variables which allowed obtaining the optimum conditions 34 fig 4 a and b indicates the simultaneous effect of contact time and dye concentration on dye removal efficiency for prepared fmfnc the dyes removal efficiency decreased with an increase in dyes concentration from 50 to 150 mg l 1 and the maximum dye removal efficiency was obtained with 50 mg l 1 initial concentration for mb and 70 mg l 1 for ab25 as shown it was observed from fig 4 a d an increase in the dye removal efficiency was occurred with the contact time increasing then remained approximately constant after 45 min this remark exposed that in the start the dye molecules are adsorbed externally and the adsorption rate improved rapidly when the external surface became saturated the dye molecules adsorbed into the porous structure of the fmfnc then finally at some point in time reached a constant value where no more dye was adsorbed from the solution the fitted surface plots of dye separation efficiency versus the combined effect of co and t were also shown in fig 4 e and f however by investigating the combined influences of co and t on dye uptake efficiency it was realized that when the co was low the optimum temperature was obtained at lower degree probably due to the existence of a smaller number of dye molecules in the solution to be adsorbed but at high concentrated solutions the effect of heating was less efficient 3 4 kinetics isotherms and thermodynamics studies 3 4 1 kinetic study from fig s2 the calculated dye sorption capacities the reaction rate constants and the linear correlation coefficients r2 values for the different studied co were studied in table 3 and fig s3 as can be seen the r2 values obtained from pseud second order are reliably higher than those from the pseudo first order meaning that the controlling rate step is chemisorption this seems to involve valence forces through chemical reaction or electrostatic interaction between dye molecules and fmfnc 18 in addition the qe calculated values were in a harmony with the experimental qe values qe exp moreover the results showed that the rate of adsorption for both dyes based on the accessibility of active sites on the surface of fmfnc whereas the co enhanced the k2 values was declined this could be due to the higher competition for the adsorption active sites at high co compared to low co 35 although the pseudo second order kinetics has the best fitted order the obtained results from this model were not efficient to test the diffusion mechanism of mb and ab25 onto fmfnc as shown in fig 5 the linear fitting results of the adsorption process were in conformity with the intraparticle diffusion model at the first step the external surface adsorption was arisen at the outer materials surfaces that was followed by the second step which was governed by intraparticle diffusion it was the gradual adsorption step lastly the third step was the slowest step which denoted the final equilibrium step as listed in table 4 ki was improved with enhanced co as a result of the fact that multitude dye molecules interacted with active sites on fmfnc which cause high adsorption intensity at a high co for all co ki 1 are larger than ki 2 which indicate the free path available for diffusion became smaller and the pore dimensions decreased 36 while the ki 3 was significantly lower than the others which confirmed that the third step was the slowest step 3 4 2 adsorption isotherms according to the correlation coefficients and parameter values which summarized in table 5 the r2 values of langmuir model were very close to 1 and larger than that of freundlich model which suggestes that the adsorption process is a process occurs in a homogeneous surface thus with the consideration of r 2 and the error functions it was concluded that the langmuir model best represented the adsorption data which indicated that there is no transmission of dye in the plane of the surface as well as the uniform adsorption energies and that confirm the ion exchange mechanism is predominated through this process 37 the high adsorption capacity proved that the strong electrostatic interaction between dye molecules and fmfnc bending sites 38 in addition the values of rl at low temperatures were higher than those at high temperatures as shown in fig 6 the values of rl were between 0 and 1 which indicate that the adsorption of dye tends to be chemical rather than physical in nature it can be inferred that the adsorption behavior was more effective at high temperatures and the adsorption process was more irreversible 39 from freundlich model the values of 1 n f which estimates the adsorption intensity or surface heterogeneity that values between 0 and 1 it elucidates more heterogeneity as the values get near to zero however the results also indicated that adsorption of both dyes onto fmfnc was favorable using freundlich isotherm model 3 4 3 adsorption thermodynamics the thermodynamic parameters were illustrated in table 6 the negative values of Î´g showed that dyes and fmfnc systems were spontaneous furthermore the decine in the values of Î´g with increasing of temperature showed by clear evidence that the adsorption is more spontaneous at higher temperatures the positive values of Î´h indicate the endothermic nature of the process and strong electrostatic interaction between fmfnc and dye molecules however the low Î´h values confirmed the weak interactions between mb or ab25 molecules and the surface hydroxyl groups of fmfnc 4 39 on the other hand the positive values of Î´s indicate enhancement in randomness at the solid liquid interface during the adsorption process however the positive values of Î´s can be demonstrated to the result of solvent replacement phenomenon where the dye molecules need to replace the water molecules on the surface of fmfnc in order to be adsorbed 38 3 5 an exploratory adsorption study using ft ir and adsorption mechansim the ftir spectra and assignments of its bands of the prepared fmfnc before and after adsorption was shown in fig 7 and table s5 respectively the conversion of pet waste to fullerene and the presence of the oxygen containing functional moieties in fullerene that can be confirmed due to the presence of broad band around 1650 cm 1 corresponding to stretching carbonyl group co and cc vibration while the broad band at 1095 cm 1 which was ascribed to the intrinsic characteristic of sp2 graphitic materials and oxygen functionalities of skeletal stretching vibration of c o group 39 it indicates that the oxidation of fullerene cages was occurred without any solvent these two bands suggesting strong electronic interaction between the two moieties in ground state at the edges of the fullerene networks 40 41 the broad peak at 3441 cm 1 representing oh stretching vibration of hydroxyl functional groups thus showing the presence of free hydroxyl groups on the surface of fmfnc these new chemical bonds of oh co and c o clearly prove that oxidation of the fullerene cages during the reaction is occurring the broad peaks with low intensity indicates that the fullerene was attached to magnetic nanoparticles 42 it can be seen that the broad bands at 638 610 and 560 cm 1 for fmfnc and that with mb and ab25 adsorbed dyes respectively were corresponds to fe o stretching vibration mode of magnetite that attached with fullerene 43 after adsorption many significant differences have occurred for the prepared fmfnc for instance there were distinct and significant changes in the adsorption band density of oh cc and co suggesting that such ionizable functional groups on the adsorbent surface were able to interact and bind with the dye molecule also the mechanism of adsorption could be deduced on its dependent on such functional groups specially the hydroxyl group the changes in the ftir spectrum were the evidence of the formation of structures containing multiple carbon carbon bonds as well as the elimination of originally present oxygen and hydrogen atoms in addition a red shift of all bands was observed after adsorption as well as the observed hydroxyl release especially for ab25 adsorbed during the batch adsorption experiment which indicated that the oxygen groups of fullerene reacted with the surface sites of magnetite probably through ligand exchange mechanism 44 also fullerene can be immobilized through ligand exchange with surface hydroxyl groups of magnetite and through anion exchange obviously the characteristic band of oh at 3393 cm 1 for fmfnc ab25 has higher intensity as compared to its parent fmfnc and fmfnc mb which indicate that the chemical reaction occurred between hydroxide radical on the surface of fmfnc and amine group in ab25 dye and subsequently enhances the adsorption capacity of fmfnc moreover it was revealed that oxygen group probably reacte with the surface sites of fullerene and fe3o4 through ligand exchange mechanism in case of anionic dye such as ab25 dye or electrostatic interaction in case of cationic dye such as mb dye 44 45 there is a linkage between each adsorption mechanism and various functional groups in fmfnc modes of interaction of fmfnc with cationic and anionic dye are shown in fig 8 there are three modes of adsorption mechanisms as follow i the electrostatic interaction between positively charged mb dye and negatively charged group carbon especially with the presence of functional groups on the other hands the surface of carbon is variable charged and strongly depends on the ionization of surface of carbon depending on the ph so it may be occure the electrostatic interaction between positive charge of carbon at fnmfnc and negative charged of ab25 dye ii the Ï Ï sbonding takes place between bulk Ï system of carbon in fmfnc and dye molecules with cc or benzene rings and iii the hydrogen bonding is formed between the functional groups such as cooh and oh on the surface of fmfnc and dye molecules 3 6 regeneration ability the ability of fmfnc to be regenerated is an important factor to estimate its cost effectiveness as shown in fig 9 after ten cycles the removal efficiency was still high and the decrease in the removal percentage were quite small after each desorption process thus these results confirm the high recyclability and stability potential of the prepared fmfnc for cationic and anionic dyes adsorption after its regeneration in conclusion the prepared fmfnc is considered as an economic and efficient adsorbent agent which is vital for an industrial and large scale practical applications after ten cycles the porous texture of the used fmfnc is analysed by nitrogen adsorption desorption and pore size distributions fig 10 in fig 10 a fmfnc samples before and after the ten cycles of adsorption show the characteristics of microporous materials with iv type isotherm with hysteresis loop p po 0 4 which indicate that the existance of a well organized microporous structure with main contribution of mesoporosity and these characteristic is favourable for the adsorption process after adsorption of ten cycles there is remarkable of decrease of n2 adsorption indicating that the porous structure of fmfnc has been partially blocked by the incorporation of dye molecules from the adsorption branch of isotherm the specific surface area was decreased from 474 m2 g before adsorption to 360 27 and 139 04 m2 g after ten cycles of adsorption of ab25 and mb respectively the size distributions of fmfnc before and after ten cycles of adsorption are shown in fig 10 b it can be seen that the fmfnc possess large amounts of micropores in their structure and pores disappeared after ab25 or mb adsorption which could be regarded that as an evidence of the micropore occupation by ab25 or mb dye molecules 46 the large surface area and low pore diameter of fmfnc should gurantee its adsorption performance for cationic and anionic dyes in water 4 conclusions this study involved the synthesis of functionalized magnetic fullerenes via one step catalytic thermal dissociation of pet bottle wastes this method is solvent free simple fast economic controllable and environmentally friendly interestingly it was found that the prepared material has relatively high surface area with mesopores and micropore volumes in addition to superparamagnetic property also fmfnc showed a good performance in the adsorption of ab25 or mb dye after ten successive cycles the combination of fullerene with magnetic nanoparticles merge the advantage of high adsorption capacity and separation convenience whereas the prepared fmfnc would be promising adsorbent for removal of mb and ab25 dyes in terms of high efficiency stability

14119,stimuli responsive materials have attracted extensive attention as promising candidates for fouling surface of membranes therefore we investigated the performance of a simple and environmentally friendly method for fouling phenomenon in ultrafiltration membranes that does not have limitations of other cleaning method e g chemical cleaning method in this method firstly the surface of bentonite bnt nanoparticle was organo modified by 3 methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane mps and then the potassium persulfate kps is utilized as an initiator to react with n isopropyleacrylamid to introduce thermo responsive characteristic to bnt surface via free radical polymerization afterwards a series of bnt pnipaam nanocomposite membranes was fabricated infrared spectroscopy ir results indicated the successful polymerization of nipaam on bnt surface also the thermogravimetric analysis tga showed that bnt pnipaam nanocomposite was thermally less stable than the bare bnt moreover the thermo responsiveness of bnt pnipaam nanocomposites was confirmed by dynamic light scattering dls technique the thermo responsive behavior of the prepared membrane was studied via the adsorption desorption behavior of bovine serum albumin bsa on the membrane surface according to the dynamic filtration result the membrane containing bnt pnipaam nanocomposite exhibited better water flux performance by applying thermo responsive cleaning method for membrane cleaning the membrane with 0 5 wt of bnt pnipaam nanocomposite displayed higher flux recovery more than 95 under the 1000 ppm skim milk solution whereas the unmodified membrane was recovered approximately 40 the thermo responsive membrane has greater performance compared to its conventional counterpart with respect to their non mobility nature keywords thermo responsive nanocomposite physical blending antifouling membrane ultrafiltration membrane 1 introduction among all technologies that have been developed for water purification the ultrafiltration membrane method was recognized as a convenient and environmentally friendly technology 1 to date membrane fouling has been an inevitable problem that limits filtration performance membrane fouling is caused by pore blocking and foulant layer forming on the polymeric surface that leads to flux decline during filtration 2 4 since a porous membrane surface has hydrophobic properties the organic foulant can be deposited on the membrane surface through hydrophobic interaction 5 thus many attempts are focused on the modification of membrane surface to weaken the interaction between membrane and foulant 6 10 inspired by nature that can respond to stimuli the surface with stimulus responsiveness and deformability properties can present the specific antifouling performance for this purpose many efforts have been done by adding stimulus responsive materials into the membrane substrate to respond to environmental stimuli 11 14 among common stimulus responsive polymers temperature responsive polymers are the most widely used because temperature variation can be easily controlled as an external stimulus 15 a surface with thermo responsive properties has the ability to transit its state from hydrophobic to hydrophilic and vice versa leading to detachment of the located foulant on the membrane surface 16 the poly n isopropylacrylamide pnipaam is a kind of thermo responsive polymer that presents a low critical solution temperature lcst around 33 c at temperatures below the lcst the polymer chain swells due to the hydrogen bonding between amide groups and water molecules likewise at temperatures above the lcst the pnipaam chains shrink due to the hydrogen bonding destruction 17 the thermo responsiveness of pnipaam provides specific strategies for various applications including 1 self adjusting membrane permeability 18 for example in ethanol fermentation reactor for regulation of ethanol concentration 2 sieving particles with different size by pore size regulation 19 3 separating hydrophobic material based on adsorption by transition between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic states 20 and 4 thermo responsive cleaning of membrane surface 21 many approaches have been developed to introduce a stimulus responsive surface which all of them classified into two categories according to whether stimulus responsive polymer is designed after or during membrane formation 22 24 fabrication of the stimulus responsive factor after membrane formation has been done by special methods including chemical grafting and physical coating or pore filling modification of membrane surface by these methods is difficult to control and block pores of membrane and thus reduces membrane permeability here to overcome the above mentioned shortcoming direct blending membrane formation method was developed that is simple controllable and easy to scale up 25 physical blending is one of the recently developed approaches for 3d modification of membrane surfaces that has great influence on antifouling properties 26 the design of a thermo responsive composite and incorporating into the membrane polymer matrix as an additive can be a specific approach for modification of membrane surface the thermo responsive composites were designed via surface modification of nanoparticles by thermo responsive polymer nowadays bentonite bnt clays are the new generation of additives for the inorganic segment of polymer composites for membrane modification due to its significant properties including simple chemical modification ability great mechanical strength thermal stability and hydrophilic nature 27 28 hebbar et al 29 enhanced the fouling resistance and rejection capacity of polyetherimide membranes with grafting the poly 4 styrenesulfonate brush on the surface of bentonite via the distillation precipitation polymerisation method zeng et al 30 modified the polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes with different amount of dopamine da grafted halloysite nanotube hnt and then investigated the hydrophilicity and antifouling properties of the prepared membrane guo et al 31 synthesized the d amino acid polydopamine halloysite nanotube nanocomposite to improve antifouling performance of pvdf membranes although all of these nanocomposite membranes can enhance the antifouling performance they cannot completely solve the deposited fouling problem therefore the cleaning process inevitably needs to be applied often times chemical cleaning approach carried out for membrane permeation recovery results in degradation the membrane surface therefore the pnipaam induced surface due to their non mobility nature needs longer time interval between membrane cleaning which leads to increase in membrane lifetime 32 in present study we introduced a new thermo responsive nanocomposite based on modification of bnt surface with pnipaam polymer and employed as an antifouling additive for pes membranes 2 materials and methods 2 1

to achieve better quality the nano bnt solution was dispersed with ultrasonic probe for 10 min then 5 wt of mps was added to the suspension solution the mixture was stirred vigorously for 24 h the at room temperature the produced bnt mps was purified by centrifugation and re dispersing in ethanol 2 3 preparation of thermo responsive bnt pnipaam nanocomposites thermo responsive bnt pnipaam nanocomposite was synthesized via free radical polymerization the preparation steps are explained in detail as follow precursor solution was prepared by mixing bnt mps 0 5 g nipaam 0 5 g mba 0 06 g di water 60 ml and dmf 60 ml the mixture was sonicated for 15 min in a bath type sonicator next the suspension was degassed under nitrogen bubbling for about 15 min then the mixture was stirred for 24 h at 70 c and under nitrogen atmosphere then the polymerization process of nipaam was initiated by adding kps 0 01 g initiator and continued at 70 c with vigorous stirring for 24 h after completing the reaction the resulting solution was washed with ultrapure water several times to remove residual monomers or un grafted polymers the product was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for over a night 16 the schematic of all steps of bnt pnipaam nanocomposite synthesis is shown in fig 1 the bnt pnipaam nanocomposite has several segments bnt as hydrophilic inorganic additive pnipaam as thermo responsive polymer mps as coupling agent and mba cross linker 2 4 membrane preparation thermo responsive bnt pnipaam membranes were prepared via the phase inversion process briefly various amounts of bnt pnipaam nanocomposite were dispersed in dma by sonication for 15 min all membrane polymer solutions were prepared according to table 1 the mixtures were dissolved by continuously stirring about 24 h at the room temperature before casting and phase inversion step the resulting solutions were left still over night to remove trapped air bubbles afterward the mixtures were cast on the glass plate by a manual film applicator adjusted at 150 Î¼m the film was immersed in a non solvent water coagulation bath instantly after completion of phase inversion the formed membranes were kept in distilled water over a night to remove the whole residual solvent 33 2 5 the bnt pnipaam nanocomposite characterization the fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of bnt bnt mps and bnt pnipaam nanocomposite were recorded using perkin elmer 65 spectrophotometer the thermo responsive behavior of bnt pnipaam was studied by measurement of the dynamic diameter of nanocomposite at two temperatures 25 c and 40 c using dynamic light scattering analysis malvern zetasizer nano zs90 a thermogravimetric analysis tga investigated the thermal degradation of pnipaam on a thermogravimetric analyzer sdt q600 v20 9 build 20 at a heating rate of 20 c min in argon atmosphere from 25 c to 600 c 2 6 membrane characterization the cross sectional and top surface morphology of prepared membranes was investigated by a jsm 840a scanning electron microscopy sem wettability of membrane surface was studied by water contact angle measuring of di water the water volume was 20 Î¼ l and the image of the water drop was captured by a ccd camera 4 megapixels equipped with a macro zoom lens and panel light the five measurements were carried out for each membrane to achieve an average value of contact angel the effect of bnt pnipaam additive on porosity of membrane was evaluated by dry wet weight method the following equation was used to calculate the porosity of prepared membrane 34 1 Îµ w w w d a l d w where wd is the weight of dry membrane and ww is the weight of wet membrane a is the membrane area m2 dw is the density of pure water 998 kg m3 and l is the thickness of membrane 150 Î¼m moreover guerout elford ferry equation eq 2 was used to determine the mean pore radius of membrane rm 34 2 r m 2 9 1 75 Îµ 8 Î· l q Îµ a Î´ p where Î· is water viscosity 8 9 10 4 pa s q is membrane water permeation per time m3 s and Î´p is operational pressure 0 3 mpa also the average value is based on 3 times experiment 2 7 adsorption desorption of bsa molecules thermo responsive performance of prepared membranes was investigated using dynamic adsorption of bsa in the membrane surface by changing the temperature across the lcst of pnipaam in this experiment a certain amount of membrane was immersed into 25 ml of bsa solution 1000 ppm it is evident that the adsorbed water by membrane can influence the bsa concentration to prevent this effect the membrane must be saturated with water before immersion in bsa solution then the samples were placed in a water bath shaker n biotek 304 and the temperature was set at 40 c after 24 h the amount adsorbed of bsa molecules were analyzed by uv vis spectrophotometer at 280 nm wavelength and the same step was repeated for 25 c the amount of adsorbed bsa q t was calculated by the following equation 20 3 q t c 0 c t v m where c0 is the initial and ct is the final bsa concentration in the aqueous solution v is the volume of solution ml and m is the weight of membrane g also the average value is based on 3 times experiment 2 8 membrane permeation a cross flow filtration unit was employed to evaluate the permeation performance and antifouling properties of membrane at first to obtain a stable flux each membrane was compacted for 60 min at 4 bar also during the entire of filtration process the operating pressure was kept at 3 bar the water flux was calculated according to the following equation 4 j m a t where m is the volume of water l a is the effective filtration membrane area 21 cm2 and t is the filtration time h also the average value is based on 3 times experiment 2 9 rejection and flux recovery ratio after water permeation test the 1000 ppm skim milk solution was used as fouling model of diary waste the feed tank was filed with skim milk solution and was pumped through the ultrafiltration uf unit at 3 bar for 60 min the flux of skim milk solution jp was also measured to investigate the flux recovery ratio of fouled membrane the alternate temperature change method was employed for cleaning efficiency first the membrane was rinsed by pure water at 40 1 c for 30 min then the membrane was rinsed again by pure water at 25 1 c after thermo responsive cleaning the pure water flux j2 25 1 c was measured and the frr was calculated by following equation 5 f r r 1 j 2 j 1 100 in addition to assess the effectiveness of the thermo responsive cleaning method in another series of experiments the membrane was rinsed at 25 1 c for 60 min as simple cleaning method and the frr was calculated by eq 5 several ratios were used to describe the fouling resistance ability for detailed analysis of the prepared membranes the total fouling ratio rt is the degree of total flux loss that was calculated by following equation 6 r t 1 j p j w 1 100 reversible fouling ratio rr and irreversible fouling ratio rir were calculated by the following equations 7 r r j w 2 j p j w 1 100 8 r i r j w 1 j w 2 j w 1 100 also the average value is based on 3 times experiment 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization of the bnt pnipaam nanocomposite the ir spectra of the bnt bnt mps and bnt pnipaam are presented in fig 2 the adsorption bands corresponding to bnt si o al o si o h appeared at 3619 3429 1027 521 and 465 cm 1 the green line at fig 2 the adsorptions bonds at 521 and 465 cm 1 are related to al o si and si o si respectively 35 the vibration bands at 3619 and 3429 cm 1 are related to oh and intralayer h bonded oh frequencies respectively moreover the peak at 1040 cm 1 is ascribed to si o si symmetric stretching and asymmetrical stretching of bnt 36 the adsorptions bonds at 1718 and 1630 cm 1 are associated with stretching vibrations of the co and cc groups of 3 methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane mps the blue line in fig 2 37 the absorptions at 2940 and 2893 cm 1 correspond to the stretching vibration of ch3 and ch2 respectively the stretching vibration bands of oh groups are appeared at 3429 and 3598 cm 1 the result confirms that the mps is successfully grafted onto the bnt surface fig 2 the red line displays the ir spectra of bnt pnipaam the formation of nipaam polymer is confirmed by the appearance of absorptions band of co and nh at 1729 and 1659 cm 1 38 furthermore two peaks at 2971 and 2933 cm 1 are attributed to the methylene group 39 also the stretching vibration bands of oh groups are appeared at 3437 and 3614 cm 1 fig 3 shows the tga curves of bnt and bnt pnipaam nanocomposites the bnt and bnt pnipaam samples display a weight loss of 12 and 6 respectively between 25 c and 200 c attributed to the volatilization of adsorbed water in samples the bnt pnipaam sample shows the second weight loss stage about 21 between 250 c 450 c due to pnipaam backbone decomposition 40 thermo responsive performances of bnt pnipaam nanocomposites were characterized by changing the temperature across the lcst of pnipaam 25 c 40 c using dynamic light scattering dls analysis the data of particle size distribution with the specific percentage are presented in table s1 according to the dls results the bnt pnipaam exhibits dramatic temperature induced changing related to the transition of chain to globule of pnipaam polymer on the surface of bnt nanoparticles in the aqueous solution fig 4 the z average diameter of bnt pnipaam nanocomposite is 970 9 nm at 25 c fig 4 c and 513 9 nm at 40 c fig 4 d also the z average diameter of bnt nanoparticles at two temperatures is presented in fig 4 a and b the thermo responsive behavior of pnipaam chain is directly related to its state transitions between hydrophilic and hydrophobic the base of this transition is caused by domination of hydrogen bonds between polymer and surrounding water molecules at below and above the lcst around 33 c as can be seen in schematic illustration fig 5 at low temperatures the most and strongest interaction occurs between pnipaam chain and water molecules arranged around the polymer polar groups resulting in hydration of polymer chains by increasing the temperature up to lcst the water hydrogen bonds are decreased and the polymer chains are partially dehydrated 41 42 hydrogen bonding destruction at high temperatures can be explained by gibbs free energy Î´g hydration of polymer chains gives favorable exothermic enthalpy Î´ h 0 because the formation of fully hydrogen bonding is stable the temperature increment is unfavorable for gibbs free energy Î´g turning positive with respect to the increasing in the enthalpy term the globular conformation of the polymer chain as shown in fig 5 gives favorable entropy Î´ s 0 that leads to gibbs free energy Î´g turning negative 43 the entropy increases due to the release of a larger amount of water molecules at lcst caused by the collapse of the ordered arrangement of water network around the polymer chain and consequently conformational changes occurr at this temperature 44 3 2 characterization of the bnt pnipaam membrane 3 2 1 membrane wettability the hydrophilicity value of membrane surface can be achieved by water contact angle measurement 45 fig 6 shows the contact angle of pes and bnt pnipaam modified membranes the unmodified pes membrane possesses the highest water contact angle of 74 03 and the bnt pnipaam 1 has lower water contact angle about 61 04 for all membranes by increasing bnt pnipaam amount the water contact angle shows a downward trend this reduction is directly related to hydrophilicity of blended membranes 46 3 2 2 sem the cross section and top surface morphology of prepared membranes was characterized by sem image analysis figs 7 and 8 in all figures the asymmetric structure the dense top layer and porous finger like sub layer can clearly be seen the phase separation kinetic in phase inversion process was enhanced by adding bnt pnipaam nanocomposite in membrane casting solution which resulted in extension of macro void structure during membrane formation 47 the 0 5 of bnt pnipaam nanocomposite membrane showed an increase in the number of pores on the top layer as well as in the porous supporting layer however in the membrane with 1 of bnt pnipaam nanocomposite fewer expand macro voids formed that may be due the further increasing in nanocomposite amount leading to a decrement in exchange rate between solvent and non solvent caused by the increment in viscosity of membrane solution 48 also the top surface sem images of prepared membranes show in fig 8 from the images comparing to bnt membrane the bnt pnipaam nanocomposite membranes have a strongly different surface morphology in terms of agglomeration and distribution of nanoparticles the bnt pnipaam 0 5 membrane surface shows better nanoparticle distribution in the case of bnt pnipaam 1 sample the nanoparticles are agglomerated on the surface of membrane which is due to the extra addition of them 3 2 3 porosity and mean pore radius of prepared membrane the porosity and mean pore radius of prepared membranes are presented in table 2 as shown in the table incorporating the hydrophilic bnt pnipaam nanocomposites into membrane matrix accelerated the solvent and non solvent diffusion rate thus enhancing the pores size and the porosity of prepared membranes 49 on other hand in high amounts of nanocomposite loading the porosity and pore radius of membrane had a declining trend also these results are confirmed by sem figures 3 2 4 adsorption desorption of bsa molecules the membrane thermo responsive performance was investigated by hydrophobic adsorption hydrophilic desorption method 50 the qt value of prepared membranes at three successive steps are presented in fig 9 the first step at 25 c the second at above the lcst of pnipaam 40 c and the final was performed again at 25 c to investigate the ability of membrane surface to remove adsorbed bsa molecules according to fig 9 bnt pnipaam nanocomposite membranes show hydrophobic adsorption at 40 c and hydrophilic desorption at 25 c that is related to the thermo responsive behavior of the surface of bnt pnipaam membranes the bsa molecules are adsorbed on the thermo responsive surface at 40 c and can be desorbed by decreasing the temperature at 25 c the amount of adsorbed bsa on the thermo responsive membrane decreased with the increment of bnt pnipaam nanocomposite at 40 c pnipaam chains turned to hydrophobic state and became shrinkage structurally so as results show the amount of adsorbed bsa on the thermo responsive membrane increased however the adsorbed bsa for bnt pnipaam 1 is lower than bnt pnipaam 5 also the qt value of pes membrane shows no significant adsorption at 40 c and desorption at 25 c 3 2 5 permeability fig 10 shows the pure water flux for bnt pnipaam blended membrane the water flux increased by adding the content of bnt pnipaam up to 0 5 wt and decreased beyond 0 5 wt generally the presence of hydrophilic bnt pnipaam improves the hydrophilicity of membrane surface and attracts water molecules inside membrane pores that leads to increasing of water flux the water flux decreased despite improving hydrophilicity with more addition of bnt pnipaam content these results could be due to the blockage of membrane pores by agglomerate of bnt pnipaam nanocomposite 51 the optimum amount of bnt pnipaam nanocomposite in membrane matrix was found to be 0 5 wt where the best membrane performance was observed 3 2 6 fouling experiment the fouling and cleaning efficiency of prepared membranes compared to unmodified membranes were evaluated by cross flow filtration of a skim milk solution after milk solution permeation test in the first series the thermo responsive cleaning and in another separate series the simple cleaning method were carried out as described in section 2 10 the flux recovery ratio of various content of bnt pnipaam membrane were measured and shown in fig 11 0 5 wt bnt pnipaam membrane showed 98 recovery ratio and improved fouling resistant properties also the low flux recovery ratio was achieved in simple cleaning method that indicated many of foulant couldn t be removed by this method for more investigation the rt rr and rir value of prepared membranes were determined and presented in fig 12 as can be seen the antifouling properties of bnt pnipaam membrane were enhanced the rt of prepared membranes were reduced by increasing of bnt pnipaam amount the 0 5 wt bnt pnipaam membrane with lower irreversible fouling presents the best performance in thermo responsive cleaning thermo responsive cleaning mechanism of the bnt pnipaam membrane is shown in fig 13 thermo responsive cleaning method can be introduced as a simple and environmentally friendly process without the need to remove the membrane during the thermo responsive cleaning method the membrane was washed by pure water at 40 c above the lcst of pnipaam and then with pure water at 25 c at above the lcst temperature the polymer becomes hydrophobic and the hydration layer around the polymer was disrupted so the fouling layer is damaged during the removal of water molecules and the structure of polymer is changed from chain to globule 52 at 25 c the polymer returns to hydrophilic state and leads to further destruction of fouling layer 4 conclusion we modified the surface of pes membrane with bnt pnipaam nano composite and used thermo responsive cleaning method for membrane cleaning process the thermo responsive cleaning method increases the cleaning interval of membranes as well as its lifetime the conclusions of this work are listed below 1 the thermo responsive bnt pnipaam nanocomposite was successfully synthesized and confirmed by ir analysis the dls analysis

14119,stimuli responsive materials have attracted extensive attention as promising candidates for fouling surface of membranes therefore we investigated the performance of a simple and environmentally friendly method for fouling phenomenon in ultrafiltration membranes that does not have limitations of other cleaning method e g chemical cleaning method in this method firstly the surface of bentonite bnt nanoparticle was organo modified by 3 methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane mps and then the potassium persulfate kps is utilized as an initiator to react with n isopropyleacrylamid to introduce thermo responsive characteristic to bnt surface via free radical polymerization afterwards a series of bnt pnipaam nanocomposite membranes was fabricated infrared spectroscopy ir results indicated the successful polymerization of nipaam on bnt surface also the thermogravimetric analysis tga showed that bnt pnipaam nanocomposite was thermally less stable than the bare bnt moreover the thermo responsiveness of bnt pnipaam nanocomposites was confirmed by dynamic light scattering dls technique the thermo responsive behavior of the prepared membrane was studied via the adsorption desorption behavior of bovine serum albumin bsa on the membrane surface according to the dynamic filtration result the membrane containing bnt pnipaam nanocomposite exhibited better water flux performance by applying thermo responsive cleaning method for membrane cleaning the membrane with 0 5 wt of bnt pnipaam nanocomposite displayed higher flux recovery more than 95 under the 1000 ppm skim milk solution whereas the unmodified membrane was recovered approximately 40 the thermo responsive membrane has greater performance compared to its conventional counterpart with respect to their non mobility nature keywords thermo responsive nanocomposite physical blending antifouling membrane ultrafiltration membrane 1 introduction among all technologies that have been developed for water purification the ultrafiltration membrane method was recognized as a convenient and environmentally friendly technology 1 to date membrane fouling has been an inevitable problem that limits filtration performance membrane fouling is caused by pore blocking and foulant layer forming on the polymeric surface that leads to flux decline during filtration 2 4 since a porous membrane surface has hydrophobic properties the organic foulant can be deposited on the membrane surface through hydrophobic interaction 5 thus many attempts are focused on the modification of membrane surface to weaken the interaction between membrane and foulant 6 10 inspired by nature that can respond to stimuli the surface with stimulus responsiveness and deformability properties can present the specific antifouling performance for this purpose many efforts have been done by adding stimulus responsive materials into the membrane substrate to respond to environmental stimuli 11 14 among common stimulus responsive polymers temperature responsive polymers are the most widely used because temperature variation can be easily controlled as an external stimulus 15 a surface with thermo responsive properties has the ability to transit its state from hydrophobic to hydrophilic and vice versa leading to detachment of the located foulant on the membrane surface 16 the poly n isopropylacrylamide pnipaam is a kind of thermo responsive polymer that presents a low critical solution temperature lcst around 33 c at temperatures below the lcst the polymer chain swells due to the hydrogen bonding between amide groups and water molecules likewise at temperatures above the lcst the pnipaam chains shrink due to the hydrogen bonding destruction 17 the thermo responsiveness of pnipaam provides specific strategies for various applications including 1 self adjusting membrane permeability 18 for example in ethanol fermentation reactor for regulation of ethanol concentration 2 sieving particles with different size by pore size regulation 19 3 separating hydrophobic material based on adsorption by transition between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic states 20 and 4 thermo responsive cleaning of membrane surface 21 many approaches have been developed to introduce a stimulus responsive surface which all of them classified into two categories according to whether stimulus responsive polymer is designed after or during membrane formation 22 24 fabrication of the stimulus responsive factor after membrane formation has been done by special methods including chemical grafting and physical coating or pore filling modification of membrane surface by these methods is difficult to control and block pores of membrane and thus reduces membrane permeability here to overcome the above mentioned shortcoming direct blending membrane formation method was developed that is simple controllable and easy to scale up 25 physical blending is one of the recently developed approaches for 3d modification of membrane surfaces that has great influence on antifouling properties 26 the design of a thermo responsive composite and incorporating into the membrane polymer matrix as an additive can be a specific approach for modification of membrane surface the thermo responsive composites were designed via surface modification of nanoparticles by thermo responsive polymer nowadays bentonite bnt clays are the new generation of additives for the inorganic segment of polymer composites for membrane modification due to its significant properties including simple chemical modification ability great mechanical strength thermal stability and hydrophilic nature 27 28 hebbar et al 29 enhanced the fouling resistance and rejection capacity of polyetherimide membranes with grafting the poly 4 styrenesulfonate brush on the surface of bentonite via the distillation precipitation polymerisation method zeng et al 30 modified the polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes with different amount of dopamine da grafted halloysite nanotube hnt and then investigated the hydrophilicity and antifouling properties of the prepared membrane guo et al 31 synthesized the d amino acid polydopamine halloysite nanotube nanocomposite to improve antifouling performance of pvdf membranes although all of these nanocomposite membranes can enhance the antifouling performance they cannot completely solve the deposited fouling problem therefore the cleaning process inevitably needs to be applied often times chemical cleaning approach carried out for membrane permeation recovery results in degradation the membrane surface therefore the pnipaam induced surface due to their non mobility nature needs longer time interval between membrane cleaning which leads to increase in membrane lifetime 32 in present study we introduced a new thermo responsive nanocomposite based on modification of bnt surface with pnipaam polymer and employed as an antifouling additive for pes membranes 2 materials and methods 2 1

at 70 c and under nitrogen atmosphere then the polymerization process of nipaam was initiated by adding kps 0 01 g initiator and continued at 70 c with vigorous stirring for 24 h after completing the reaction the resulting solution was washed with ultrapure water several times to remove residual monomers or un grafted polymers the product was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 c for over a night 16 the

membranes was investigated using dynamic adsorption of bsa in the membrane surface by changing the temperature across the lcst of pnipaam in this experiment a certain amount of membrane was immersed into 25 ml of bsa solution 1000 ppm it is evident that the adsorbed water by membrane can influence the bsa concentration to prevent this effect the membrane must be saturated with water before immersion in bsa solution then the samples were placed in a water bath shaker n biotek 304 and the temperature was set at 40 c after 24 h the amount adsorbed of bsa molecules were analyzed by uv vis

the bnt and bnt pnipaam samples display a weight loss of 12 and 6 respectively between 25 c and 200 c attributed to the volatilization of adsorbed water in samples the bnt pnipaam sample shows the second weight loss stage about 21 between 250 c 450 c due to pnipaam backbone decomposition 40 thermo responsive performances of bnt pnipaam nanocomposites were characterized by changing the
