7365,most hydrological analysis and modeling studies require reliable and accurate precipitation data for successful simulations however precipitation measurements should be more representative of the true precipitation distribution many approaches and techniques are used to collect precipitation data recently hydrometeorological and climatological applications of satellite precipitation products have experienced a significant improvement with the emergence of the latest satellite products namely the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm mission imerg products which can be utilized to estimate and analyze precipitation data this study focuses on the validation of the imerg early late and final run rainfall products using ground based rain gauge observations throughout saudi arabia for the period from october 2015 to april 2016 the accuracy of each imerg product is assessed using six statistical performance measures to conduct three main evaluations namely regional event based and station based evaluations the results indicate that the early run product performed well in the middle and eastern parts as well as some of the western parts of the country meanwhile the satellite estimates for the other parts fluctuated between an overestimation and an underestimation the late run product showed an improved accuracy over the southern and western parts however over the northern and middle parts it showed relatively high errors the final run product revealed significantly improved precipitation estimations and successfully obtained higher accuracies over most parts of the country this study provides an early assessment of the performance of the gpm satellite products over the middle east the study findings can be used as a beneficial reference for the future development of the imerg algorithms keywords global precipitation measurement gpm imerg rain gauge precipitation saudi arabia 1 introduction precipitation which is a major component of the hydrological cycle falls in many different forms according to the meteorological conditions moreover precipitation is one of the most important components of the global energy cycle kidd and huffman 2011 ebert et al 2007 measurements of precipitation provide one of the primary inputs for hydrological meteorological and climate models which are used to predict different natural hazards such as landslides floods and droughts li et al 2013 wu et al 2012 the responses of the hydrological and energy cycles depend upon not only the precipitation amount but also other characteristics including the spatial pattern intensity and duration of precipitation heistermann and kneis 2011 sorooshian et al 2011 therefore precipitation estimates with a high spatiotemporal resolution are always needed for various applications the acquisition of precipitation measurements and the quality control of precipitation products are the most important steps prior to performing any analysis or constructing any hydrologic model li and shao 2010 the most widely used techniques to estimate precipitation are point measurements i e rain gauges commercial microwave links satellite based sensors and ground based weather radar li et al 2013 raich et al 2017 rain gauges can provide direct measurements of precipitation and they are considered to provide ground truth for precipitation observations due to their accuracy when compared with other sensors there are many types of recording rain gauges however only three types namely the tipping bucket the universal weighing type gauge and the float type gauge are commonly used by hydrometeorological agencies to measure precipitation all three types of gauges have numerous measurement problems that can be summarized as follows 1 the underestimation of heavy precipitation due to splashing 2 instrumental problems 3 external factors such as wind and evaporation of precipitation and 4 observer errors tapiador et al 2012 in addition gauge measurements represent point values and not aerial measurements and thus they cannot describe spatial variations in precipitation radar instruments measure precipitation indirectly by making use of the backscattering of electromagnetic waves via hydrometeors i e water drops the main benefit of radar is its ability to monitor large areas with a high real time resolution germann et al 2006 however radar measurements also have many error characteristics such as range dependent systematic errors mean field systematic errors random errors and obstruction by topography in addition radar networks do not cover all parts of the world tang et al 2016 during the past thirty years the utilization of multiple satellite sensors to measure the global precipitation has increased significantly ebert et al 2007 tang et al 2016 the first devoted satellite that was used to measure precipitation was the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm which became operational in 1997 li and shao 2010 tian et al 2007 prakash et al 2018 ning et al 2016 the trmm satellite was intended to measure moderate to heavy rainfall to provide a better understanding of the precipitation distribution around the globe and generate near real time precipitation products li and shao 2010 tian et al 2007 prakash et al 2018 zhou et al 2008 several free access satellite precipitation products have been extensively studied and they have been verified both globally and regionally and subsequently released for public use tang et al 2016 examples of these products include the precipitation estimation from remote sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann technique sorooshian et al 2000 the climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 the persiann cloud classification system persiann ccs hong et al 2004 the trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 and the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap project kubota et al 2007 using these products many studies demonstrated that earth observing satellites can reasonably estimate precipitation rates and that they are also able to represent the spatiotemporal variations in the precipitation over most parts of the world with a high resolution wang et al 2017 tang et al 2016 tian et al 2007 dixon and wilby 2015 the newly introduced global precipitation measurement gpm mission is an international constellation of satellites grouped to provide next generation measurements of global rain and snow at high spatial 0 1 0 1 and temporal half hourly resolutions the constellation consists of one main observatory satellite surrounded by ten partner satellites nasa 2016a the gpm core observatory satellite was launched through the cooperation between the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japanese aerospace exploration agency jaxa on february 27 2014 the gpm adopts modern technology and instruments thereby raising the standard of precipitation measurements the gpm mission aims to improve the existing knowledge about the global water and energy cycles enhance the ability to predict extreme events and provide precipitation products that can be applied directly to all scientific fields nasa 2016b the gpm has many products which are classified into four categories according to nasa the gpm categories i e levels are level 0 level 1 level 2 and level 3 as shown in table 1 the recommended product for use by researchers is level 3 this product is provided by the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg algorithm which is designed to incorporate merge and inter calibrate all precipitation microwave mw estimates along with infrared ir satellite estimates ground precipitation gauges and all other precipitation estimators involved in the era of tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm satellites huffman et al 2015 nasa 2016c nasa provides three main imerg products early near real time run products late run products and final run products some studies investigated the accuracy of the gpm imerg products using earlier satellite products such as the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42 v7 product and demonstrated their potential for hydrological applications recent studies reported a significant improvement in the detection and measurement of rainfall intensities using the gpm satellites compared with earlier satellites e g khodadoust siuki et al 2017 wang et al 2017 other studies evaluated the gpm products against ground measurements and reported a good agreement between the satellite estimates and the ground observations e g asong et al 2017 sungmin et al 2017 the trmm rainfall products for saudi arabia were evaluated by almazroui 2011 for the period from 1998 to 2009 as the results showed varying degrees of accuracy for the trmm across different events and regions the study recommended using trmm rainfall products only for ungauged regions and for those regions with extremely sparse rain gauge networks to supplement the rainfall data in the country another recent study tekeli and fouli 2016 recommended using trmm rainfall products for flood warning purposes in urban areas and concluded that trmm rainfall products could provide limited input information for flood warning systems and thus they cautioned against relying solely upon those product during large rainfall events both a comparison and an evaluation of the gpm imerg products against ground observation gauges are highly important for different regions across the world because those products are being continuously refined moreover feedback on the performance of those products in different regions will be invaluable for the development of subsequent product versions this study evaluates the imerg over an arid region with a very sparse weather station network this study is conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the gpm imerg early late and final run precipitation products using all available daily ground based observational data over saudi arabia as a reference during the period from october 1 2015 to april 30 2016 the results will shed light on the accuracy of native satellite products and the effectiveness of improvements to the late products in the study region in addition the results will provide guidance on whether satellite products that are becoming available in semi real time with high temporal and spatial resolutions can be adequate for different hydrometeorological applications in the region 2 study area this study encompasses the whole kingdom of saudi arabia which covers the area located between 34 32 00 55 40 00 e and 32 15 00 16 22 00 n as shown in fig 1 this location is characterized by tropical and subtropical desert regions hag elsafi and el tayib 2016 al zahrani and husain 1998 it has a dry desert climate with generally light winds and high temperatures in most regions saudi arabia hosts thirteen administrative regions riyadh makkah madinah qassim asir tabuk hail jazan najran al baha al jouf the eastern region and the northern borders region each region contains a number of rain gauge stations table 2 summarizes the sub regions and the number of rain gauges within each region fig 1 shows the distribution of the rain gauge stations over saudi arabia the rain gauge data were downloaded from the website of the ministry of water and electricity mowe saudi arabia for the period from october 1 2015 to april 30 2016 website http app mowe gov sa dailyrainsnews rain dams aspx accessed may nov 2016 in saudi arabia each season has distinctly different weather features generally summer rains are caused by the intertropical convergence zone and the northward advance of the southwesterly monsoon sen and al subai 2002 the effects of which decline from north to south not including the highlands where the uplift factor is dominant hag elsafi and el tayib 2016 abdullah and al mazroui 1998 meanwhile winter rains are produced by westerly waves in the upper atmosphere and disturbances from the mediterranean sea and the sudan trough hag elsafi and el tayib 2016 the spatial and temporal variations in the precipitation amounts are a major consideration of water projects and other activities the regional and local climates are both influenced by large scale atmospheric movements along with surficial features in addition atmospheric movement changes constitute important aspects of the regional climate hasanean and almazroui 2015 the rainfall features vary both locally and regionally based on atmospheric circulation patterns resulting from the el niño southern oscillation enso the north atlantic oscillation nao and other variability patterns hag elsafi and el tayib 2016 hasanean and almazroui 2015 almazroui 2011 generally the rainy season in saudi arabia extends from october to april hasanean and almazroui 2015 almazroui 2011 the ministry of water 1984 during the other months almost no precipitation can be observed throughout saudi arabia except for the southwestern region almazroui 2011 the rainfall pattern in the southwestern region has a high spatial variation due to the complex topography of the area which affects the satellite accuracy the topographically driven convective rain in the southwestern region manifests as multi rain events in this specific region of saudi arabia al zahrani and husain 1998 al mazroui 1998 subyani 2004 overall in the desert areas the mean annual precipitation is less than 100 mm while it ranges between 250 and 300 mm in the mountainous areas hag elsafi and el tayib 2016 al zahrani and husain 1998 hasanean and almazroui 2015 3 precipitation data sets 3 1 ground based precipitation data set rain gauges are employed globally as references for precipitation data as they provide a direct physical record of the precipitation at a given point in this study daily rainfall data were collected from all regions of the kingdom of saudi arabia via the online database service provided by the ministry of water and electricity mowe saudi arabia the day in saudi arabia begins 3 h ahead of gmt gmt 3 the gpm products were aggregated to the local day the mowe gauges used in this study are not included among the rain gauges used by the global precipitation climatology center gpcc to perform adjustments to the final run imerg product this allows us to perform a completely independent evaluation of the final run product which is highly dependent on gauge adjustments the mowe database covers the 13 administrative regions each region has many sub regional stations see table 2 the data collection was determined according to the availability of rainfall records during the study period ranging from october 1 2015 to april 30 2016 i e the rainy season a total of 1455 observations were recorded from 189 stations the minimum amount of rainfall detected during the study period was 0 1 mm day the rain gauge network in saudi arabia is unevenly distributed as can be observed from fig 1 which shows that the stations are relatively densely spaced in the western region madinah and in the southwestern regions jazan and asir where the climate is wet as well as in the middle region riyadh where there is a dense population however the eastern and northern regions have relatively sparse rain gauge station densities the variations in the data provided by the mowe were evaluated for each region through a descriptive statistical analysis which is presented in table 3 the statistics shown in table 3 were computed for the rain records observed during the study period from october 2015 to april 2016 3 2 satellite based precipitation data set the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg algorithm was used to estimate the precipitation measurements from the constellation of satellites this algorithm has been sustainably used since the launch of the gpm core observatory satellite to estimate the amount of precipitation the imerg algorithm produces precipitation estimates at a high spatial and temporal resolution of 0 1 0 1 longitude latitude at every half hour interval imerg provides three precipitation products namely early run late run and final run products based on the latency and the need of the product the final run product is a post real time product provided with a latency of four months while the early and late run products are near real time products with latencies of 6 h and 18 h respectively the gpm imerg products were downloaded from the nasa precipitation processing system pps ftp servers early run product nasa 2016d late run product nasa 2016e and final run product nasa 2016f 4 methodology to evaluate the imerg products several steps were carried out fig 2 the process starts with the preparation of the ground measurement data in addition to the gpm data processing and preparation the subsequent step consists of data analysis which includes three major steps an event determination using a script developed by the authors based on visual basic vb net an analysis of gpm files the downloaded gpm files are converted into an ascii format and a coordinate matching process cmp using a vb net script the last step is a comparison of the observed satellite gpm data with the reference data rain gauge data using widely used statistical performance measures 4 1 data processing 4 1 1 ground measurements and data preparation the rainfall ground measurement data were downloaded from the mowe website and the coordinates of each station were obtained the geoplaner website was used to determine the elevation altitude of each rain gauge station http www geoplaner com the coordinates provided were in decimal degrees the utm converter application was used to convert the coordinates from decimal degrees to universal transverse mercator utm coordinates for each rain gauge station http www utmconverter com finally a station id was given to each station consisting of two characters used to identify the region and one number referring to the sequence in the database list 4 1 2 gpm data preparation the gpm data were available in an rt h5 file format rt refers to real time and h5 denotes an hdf5 file the precipitation products cover most of the globe the data were extracted and converted into an ascii format using an algorithm written in r language in addition the data were adjusted to match a saudi arabian day which begins 3 h ahead of gmt gmt 3 4 2 data analysis 4 2 1 events determination the data collected from the mowe contained more than 1450 rain gauge observations covering all of saudi arabia to determine the rainfall events that occurred during the study period a code was developed using vb net to analyze all of the data and to specify the storm events according to a minimum number of occurrences i e the number of rain gauge observations which is set to 30 stations in this study the reason for the selection of 30 stations was to provide rain records from at least 16 of the total available number of rain gauges from all over saudi arabia this 16 was proven to cover more than 40 of the land of saudi arabia 4 2 2 analysis of gpm files the gpm data processing results were analyzed to ensure that the extracted data were located within saudi arabia and that they precisely covered the analysis period additionally headers were added to the processed files ascii files to facilitate the searching process conducted within the developed code 4 2 3 coordinate matching process the coordinate matching process was programmed using vb net this program was aimed at achieving the following goals 1 search for every rain gauge record during each event using the record date and utm zone of the station to select the appropriate gpm file from the processed gpm data 2 read the selected gpm file and explore the utm coordinates for each gpm intersection point to compare each intersection point with the location coordinates of the rain gauge station 3 pick up the closest intersection point when that intersection point lies atop the latitude longitude 0 1 0 1 quadrangle approximately 11 11 km as indicated in fig 3 and 4 compare the rainfall measurements from the specified rain gauge station and the selected gpm intersection 4 3 performance measures with the intent of assessing the performances of the gpm satellite precipitation products six commonly used statistical performance measures were selected these statistical measures are generally grouped into three main classes on the basis of their applications tang et al 2016 ning et al 2016 yong et al 2010 the first group is used to describe the biases and errors within the satellite data in comparison with the rain gauge data it consists of the mean absolute error mae the root mean squared error rmse and the relative bias rb the second group includes only one statistical measurement namely the correlation coefficient cc which describes the consistency between rain gauge data and satellite estimates the third group describes the contingency of the satellite estimates through two statistical parameters namely the probability of detection pod and the critical success index csi tables 4 and 5 summarize these statistical performance measures and their expressions used for the comparison between the rain gauge data and satellite data 4 4 comparison process three main comparison or evaluation processes were conducted namely region based station based and event based evaluations the region based comparison was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the rainfall detected by the gpm satellite for each sub region versus that of the rainfall measured by the rain gauges within the same sub region the principle is to evaluate the overall accuracy of the measurements for the 13 administrative regions in saudi arabia the station based evaluation was performed to investigate the spatial distribution of the accuracy of each rain gauge station and determine their performance the event based evaluation was conducted based on the selection of the largest events that occurred during the study period ranging from october 2015 to april 2016 to ensure that the appropriate record was available to conduct the analysis a minimum threshold of 30 rain records observed by different rain gauges every day was adopted in this study accordingly 11 events resulted from the available records 5 results and discussion 5 1 regional evaluation in this study the imerg products were evaluated both regionally and nationally using six statistical performance measures over all of saudi arabia during the study period the pod and csi measures are shown in fig 4 a f the imerg early run product performed well in detecting the precipitation throughout most of the regions in saudi arabia except for makkah which exhibited a relatively low detection less than0 6 the imerg late run product showed a better performance in detecting the precipitation over all of the regions of saudi arabia including makkah greater than0 7 moreover the final run product showed a robust detection rate of almost 70 throughout saudi arabia with pod and csi measures exceeding 0 9 the rb was tested in all regions over the study period fig 4g i the results for the imerg early run product indicate that the eastern region qassim riyadh and madinah showed a low rb of 1 which is considered a reliable performance in estimating the precipitation the gpm satellite overestimated the precipitation over the northern borders region tabuk al jouf and hail with rb values of more than 20 meanwhile over the remaining regions namely jazan asir al baha and makkah the gpm satellite underestimated the precipitation by more than 5 the imerg late run product showed the same performance for most of the regions except for asir which had a significantly lower rb of about 1 the imerg final run product showed a substantial improvement over all of the saudi arabian regions this can be noticed clearly in fig 4g i where the final run product has the lowest relative bias 1 compared with the other products overall the final run product showed adequate results over 70 of the study area the mae results for the imerg early run product showed low errors over riyadh and the eastern region of less than 10 mm see fig 5 a c while tabuk hail and al jouf exhibited the highest errors more than 25 mm this reveals that the satellite performed poorly in these regions the rest of the regions showed a moderate performance in terms of the mae with values ranging from 15 mm to 25 mm although the imerg late run product revealed a relatively lower mae than the imerg early run product that improvement was not significant in most of the regions however the imerg final run product showed a significant improvement in the accuracy of the precipitation estimates see fig 5a c all of the regions displayed an mae of less than 10 mm except for hail madinah and asir for which the mae ranged between 10 mm and 15 mm the rmse results for the imerg early run product showed a relatively low error for riyadh and the eastern region of less than 10 mm indicating that the satellite performed well over these regions see fig 5d f meanwhile the northern borders region and makkah exhibited a moderate rmse of 20 mm the rest of the regions namely tabuk hail al jouf madinah qassim and al baha had the highest rmse values more than 30 mm revealing that the satellite showed poor performance over these regions moreover the imerg late run product demonstrated considerable improvement through a reduction in the rmse from 40 mm to 20 mm for asir and jazan in contrast the imerg final run product revealed a substantial improvement in the accuracy of the precipitation estimates see fig 5d f all of the regions exhibited an rmse of less than 15 mm except for hail madinah and asir in which the rmse ranged between 15 mm and 30 mm riyadh tabuk and jazan had a high cc more than 0 5 p values less than 0 001 for the imerg early run product meanwhile al jouf and hail displayed a moderate cc from 0 4 to 0 5 p value less than 0 05 in addition to asir and qassim these regions exhibited a higher cc for the late run product as shown in fig 5g i however the northern borders region the eastern region makkah al baha and madinah had a relatively low cc less than 0 2 p value greater than 0 05 for both products in contrast the final run product proved its accuracy with a significant increase in the cc values for almost all of the regions throughout saudi arabia more than 0 5 p value less than 0 05 with the exception of al baha makkah and madinah which had cc values that ranged from 0 1 to 0 2 p value greater than 0 1 5 2 station based evaluation the station based evaluation was performed by testing each station individually then the resultant measures were interpolated using the geographic information systems gis inverse distance weighting idw tool to investigate the variation in each statistical measure over all of saudi arabia beginning with the pod and csi which are presented in fig 6 a f the evaluation of the satellite estimates using these statistical measures for the imerg early run product showed a substantial performance in detecting the precipitation over most parts of saudi arabia more than 0 8 with the exception of the southeastern part of the country which had values ranging from 0 5 to 0 7 the southeastern part of saudi arabia contains the desert of rub al khali and the low pod and csi values reflect the inferior performance of the satellite over deserts additionally a small portion of the western part showed a low detection of precipitation events however these results were improved for the imerg late run product with pod and csi values reaching more than 0 75 in areas of lower detection the final run product revealed a substantial detection of precipitation throughout saudi arabia with values greater than 0 85 for the pod and csi once again the imerg final run product proved that it contains the most accurate precipitation estimates compared with the other imerg products the mae rb and rmse were used to evaluate the accuracy of the different imerg satellite rainfall products over the region the mae results showed that the eastern and western parts of saudi arabia have lower mean absolute errors of less than 10 mm for both the early run and the late run products see fig 7 a c meanwhile the mae results were very high more than 30 mm indicating an inferior performance of the satellite in this region in contrast the imerg final run product revealed a significant improvement in the accuracy of the precipitation estimates see fig 7a c all of the regions had an mae of less than 10 mm with the exception of the southwestern part in which the mae was between 15 mm and 25 mm the rb and rmse values supported the mae results which can be observed clearly in fig 7d i these figure panels present the same trend as the mae results the eastern and western parts demonstrate superiority with remarkable satellite estimations compared with the ground observations for the early run and late run products therefore the imerg final run product proved its superiority in estimating the precipitation with very low errors and biases compared with the other imerg products the cc distribution for the early run product fig 6g i suggested that the satellite estimates over the southern northern and northeastern parts of saudi arabia had a good correlation with the ground observations these results improved significantly for the late run and final run products in the southern and eastern parts of the country however in the northern part the cc was lower in the late run product due to a high bias in the estimation of the precipitation as was mentioned in the first group evaluation nevertheless the cc results for the northern part showed some improvement in the final run product the rest of the country showed high variations in the cc due to the heterogeneity of the rainfall distribution and the variation in the topography of the middle and western parts of saudi arabia 5 3 event based evaluation the imerg products were also validated by exploring the accuracy of each product in the detection of major rain events storms that occurred during the study period over all of saudi arabia the events were considered major or large only when the number of stations that observed precipitation exceeded 30 i e if the rainstorm covered more than 40 of the total land area of saudi arabia on the same date the event determination process revealed that eleven major or large events occurred during the study period as shown in table 6 the performance measures from the event based evaluation are summarized in table 7 the pod and csi showed similar values for each event the reason for this is that the precipitation measurements acquired by the satellite but not observed by a rain gauge station were not included within the analyzed data overall for the imerg early run product the pod and csi varied from 0 68 up to 1 meanwhile the imerg late run product revealed a major improvement in the detection of precipitation by increasing the pod and csi to a range from 0 71 to 1 the final run product showed a high level of perfection in the detection of precipitation events with very high pod and csi values compared with the other imerg products in general the accuracy of detection for precipitation events by the gpm satellite could be considered substantial due to the high pod and csi values for the three products table 7 moreover the cc values for each event for the imerg early run product varied from 0 02 significance level p greater than 0 1 to 0 33 significance level p less than 0 01 except for the events observed in april 2016 these events had cc values that varied from 0 5 significance level p less than 0 005 to 0 75 significance level p less than 0 0005 and they were more correlated than the 2015 events however the cc values for the imerg late run product improved significantly 150 on average for the same events the imerg final run product showed a significant improvement compared with the other products for instance the cc values for the early late and final run products for the event on december 30 2015 were 0 005 p greater than 0 5 0 11 p greater than 0 1 and 0 34 p less than 0 05 respectively the mae and rmse results indicated that the errors in the satellite estimates for all of the events with the exception of those on november 17 and december 2 were relatively low for the early run and late run products respectively however the values of the two parameters decreased significantly when compared with those for the final run product the high errors associated with these two events were caused by a storm extending over the northern middle and western parts of saudi arabia all of which have a complex topography which increases the variability in the rainfall intensity as well as the error in the satellite measurements the mae for the imerg early run product ranged from 5 mm to 36 mm meanwhile it decreased for the imerg late and the imerg final run products by approximately 20 and 45 on average respectively the rb and rmse also exhibited the same trend of the mean absolute error table 7 overall the mae rsme and rb showed significant improvements among the gpm products the mae rsme and rb values decreased from the early run to the late run products and from the late run to the final run products for example the mae rmse and rm values decreased from 6 mm to 3 mm from 8 6 mm to 6 24 mm and from 0 75 to 0 22 respectively for the event on december 30 2015 6 conclusions this research focuses on a validation of the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm mission imerg satellite rainfall products i e the early late and final run products using ground based rain gauge observations as a reference over the kingdom of saudi arabia for the period from october 2015 to april 2016 the evaluation was carried out using six commonly used statistical performance measures the mae rmse rb cc pod and csi three main comparisons or evaluations were conducted namely event based region based and station based evaluations the region based evaluation showed low errors and biases over the eastern region riyadh madinah and qassim for the imerg early run late run and final run products while tabuk al jouf the northern borders region and hail showed relatively high errors and biases for the early run and late run products however for the final run product the errors and biases decreased significantly leaving only tabuk and al jouf with relatively high values a comparison between the satellite estimates and ground observations revealed that riyadh tabuk jazan al jouf and hail had relatively high cc values compared with the other regions for all imerg products the late run product showed a high correlation in asir and qassim furthermore the correlation results showed a remarkable improvement within the final run product with a cc of 0 5 over more than 70 of the total land area of saudi arabia moreover in terms of the satellite detection accuracy all of the imerg products tended to be consistent in detecting precipitation events although the final run product exhibited a higher detection accuracy than the other two products the station based evaluation for the imerg early run product revealed high biases and errors for the stations located in the northern and northwestern parts of saudi arabia while the middle and southern parts showed moderate errors and biases conversely the eastern part and portions of the western part exhibited very low biases and estimation errors meanwhile the station based evaluation revealed a decrease in the biases and estimation errors within the late run product over the southern and western parts of the country however the northern and middle parts of saudi arabia still suffered from high estimation errors and biases in contrast the final run product showed a significant improvement over more than 80 of the country in terms of the correlation between the satellite estimates and ground based observations the southern northern and northeastern parts of saudi arabia were shown to have high correlations for the early run product the results for the late run and final run products were also significantly enhanced in the southern and eastern parts of the country however in the northern part the correlation was lower for the late run product and higher for the final run product the rest of the country showed high variations in the correlation due to the heterogeneous rainfall distribution and variations in the topography of the middle and western parts of saudi arabia furthermore the satellite detection of rainfall events was precise for all of the imerg products although the final run product showed the best detection among all of the products for the event based evaluation the imerg final run product showed a much higher accuracy than the other imerg products for almost all of the events the final run product had a higher correlation between the satellite estimations and ground observations compared with the other imerg products additionally the mean absolute error relative bias and root mean squared error were relatively low for the final run product moreover the probability of detection and critical success index parameters were remarkably higher for the final run product in particular higher errors and biases were detected for two events namely those on november 17 and december 2 using the early run and late run products meanwhile for the final run product the errors and biases for the same events were lower by at least 50 in general the poor results observed over the northern and southern parts of saudi arabia can be interpreted as a result of the high heterogeneity in the rainfall distribution in conjunction with the high variability in the terrestrial topography in these regions in addition many researchers indicated that the satellite detection accuracy for precipitation is quite low in high latitude regions reinforcing the poor results in the southern region moreover the northern region contains a sparse distribution of rain gauge stations relative to the middle and western parts of the country this small number of stations increased the errors and biases in the estimation of the precipitation as the scarcity of rain gauge stations in northern saudi arabia is inadequate to represent the variability in the precipitation distribution overall the results revealed that the imerg final run product may have the potential to play a significant role in complementing or replacing ground precipitation measurements thereby offering a useful approach for ungauged or poorly gauged regions in addition the gpm products are available at relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions making them useful for many hydrological applications in regions such as saudi arabia that have very sparse distributions of rain gauge stations most of which report only at a daily interval moreover the imerg near real time products are available for most of the regions in saudi arabia and thus these products may be useful for early flood warning systems or other applications that require near real time rainfall data although their accuracy must be continuously evaluated acknowledgments the

7365,most hydrological analysis and modeling studies require reliable and accurate precipitation data for successful simulations however precipitation measurements should be more representative of the true precipitation distribution many approaches and techniques are used to collect precipitation data recently hydrometeorological and climatological applications of satellite precipitation products have experienced a significant improvement with the emergence of the latest satellite products namely the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm mission imerg products which can be utilized to estimate and analyze precipitation data this study focuses on the validation of the imerg early late and final run rainfall products using ground based rain gauge observations throughout saudi arabia for the period from october 2015 to april 2016 the accuracy of each imerg product is assessed using six statistical performance measures to conduct three main evaluations namely regional event based and station based evaluations the results indicate that the early run product performed well in the middle and eastern parts as well as some of the western parts of the country meanwhile the satellite estimates for the other parts fluctuated between an overestimation and an underestimation the late run product showed an improved accuracy over the southern and western parts however over the northern and middle parts it showed relatively high errors the final run product revealed significantly improved precipitation estimations and successfully obtained higher accuracies over most parts of the country this study provides an early assessment of the performance of the gpm satellite products over the middle east the study findings can be used as a beneficial reference for the future development of the imerg algorithms keywords global precipitation measurement gpm imerg rain gauge precipitation saudi arabia 1 introduction precipitation which is a major component of the hydrological cycle falls in many different forms according to the meteorological conditions moreover precipitation is one of the most important components of the global energy cycle kidd and huffman 2011 ebert et al 2007 measurements of precipitation provide one of the primary inputs for hydrological meteorological and climate models which are used to predict different natural hazards such as landslides floods and droughts li et al 2013 wu et al 2012 the responses of the hydrological and energy cycles depend upon not only the precipitation amount but also other characteristics including the spatial pattern intensity and duration of precipitation heistermann and kneis 2011 sorooshian et al 2011 therefore precipitation estimates with a high spatiotemporal resolution are always needed for various applications the acquisition of precipitation measurements and the quality control of precipitation products are the most important steps prior to performing any analysis or constructing any hydrologic model li and shao 2010 the most widely used techniques to estimate precipitation are point measurements i e rain gauges commercial microwave links satellite based sensors and ground based weather radar li et al 2013 raich et al 2017 rain gauges can provide direct measurements of precipitation and they are considered to provide ground truth for precipitation observations due to their accuracy when compared with other sensors there are many types of recording rain gauges however only three types namely the tipping bucket the universal weighing type gauge and the float type gauge are commonly used by hydrometeorological agencies to measure precipitation all three types of gauges have numerous measurement problems that can be summarized as follows 1 the underestimation of heavy precipitation due to splashing 2 instrumental problems 3 external factors such as wind and evaporation of precipitation and 4 observer errors tapiador et al 2012 in addition gauge measurements represent point values and not aerial measurements and thus they cannot describe spatial variations in precipitation radar instruments measure precipitation indirectly by making use of the backscattering of electromagnetic waves via hydrometeors i e water drops the main benefit of radar is its ability to monitor large areas with a high real time resolution germann et al 2006 however radar measurements also have many error characteristics such as range dependent systematic errors mean field systematic errors random errors and obstruction by topography in addition radar networks do not cover all parts of the world tang et al 2016 during the past thirty years the utilization of multiple satellite sensors to measure the global precipitation has increased significantly ebert et al 2007 tang et al 2016 the first devoted satellite that was used to measure precipitation was the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm which became operational in 1997 li and shao 2010 tian et al 2007 prakash et al 2018 ning et al 2016 the trmm satellite was intended to measure moderate to heavy rainfall to provide a better understanding of the precipitation distribution around the globe and generate near real time precipitation products li and shao 2010 tian et al 2007 prakash et al 2018 zhou et al 2008 several free access satellite precipitation products have been extensively studied and they have been verified both globally and regionally and subsequently released for public use tang et al 2016 examples of these products include the precipitation estimation from remote sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann technique sorooshian et al 2000 the climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 the persiann cloud classification system persiann ccs hong et al 2004 the trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 and the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap project kubota et al 2007 using these products many studies demonstrated that earth observing satellites can reasonably estimate precipitation rates and that they are also able to represent the spatiotemporal variations in the precipitation over most parts of the world with a high resolution wang et al 2017 tang et al 2016 tian et al 2007 dixon and wilby 2015 the newly introduced global precipitation measurement gpm mission is an international constellation of satellites grouped to provide next generation measurements of global rain and snow at high spatial 0 1 0 1 and temporal half hourly resolutions the constellation consists of one main observatory satellite surrounded by ten partner satellites nasa 2016a the gpm core observatory satellite was launched through the cooperation between the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japanese aerospace exploration agency jaxa on february 27 2014 the gpm adopts modern technology and instruments thereby raising the standard of precipitation measurements the gpm mission aims to improve the existing knowledge about the global water and energy cycles enhance the ability to predict extreme events and provide precipitation products that can be applied directly to all scientific fields nasa 2016b the gpm has many products which are classified into four categories according to nasa the gpm categories i e levels are level 0 level 1 level 2 and level 3 as shown in table 1 the recommended product for use by researchers is level 3 this product is provided by the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg algorithm which is designed to incorporate merge and inter calibrate all precipitation microwave mw estimates along with infrared ir satellite estimates ground precipitation gauges and all other precipitation estimators involved in the era of tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm satellites huffman et al 2015 nasa 2016c nasa provides three main imerg products early near real time run products late run products and final run products some studies investigated the accuracy of the gpm imerg products using earlier satellite products such as the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42 v7 product and demonstrated their potential for hydrological applications recent studies reported a significant improvement in the detection and measurement of rainfall intensities using the gpm satellites compared with earlier satellites e g khodadoust siuki et al 2017 wang et al 2017 other studies evaluated the gpm products against ground measurements and reported a good agreement between the satellite estimates and the ground observations e g asong et al 2017 sungmin et al 2017 the trmm rainfall products for saudi arabia were evaluated by almazroui 2011 for the period from 1998 to 2009 as the results showed varying degrees of accuracy for the trmm across different events and regions the study recommended using trmm rainfall products only for ungauged regions and for those regions with extremely sparse rain gauge networks to supplement the rainfall data in the country another recent study tekeli and fouli 2016 recommended using trmm rainfall products for flood warning purposes in urban areas and concluded that trmm rainfall products could provide limited input information for flood warning systems and thus they cautioned against relying solely upon those product during large rainfall events both a comparison and an evaluation of the gpm imerg products against ground observation gauges are highly important for different regions across the world because those products are being continuously refined moreover feedback on the performance of those products in different regions will be invaluable for the development of subsequent product versions this study evaluates the imerg over an arid region with a very sparse weather station network this study is conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the gpm imerg early late and final run precipitation products using all available daily ground based observational data over saudi arabia as a reference during the period from october 1 2015 to april 30 2016 the results will shed light on the accuracy of native satellite products and the effectiveness of improvements to the late products in the study region in addition the results will provide guidance on whether satellite products that are becoming available in semi real time with high temporal and spatial resolutions can be adequate for different hydrometeorological applications in the region 2 study area this study encompasses the whole kingdom of saudi arabia which covers the area located between 34 32 00 55 40 00 e and 32 15 00 16 22 00 n as shown in fig 1 this location is characterized by tropical and subtropical desert regions hag elsafi and el tayib 2016 al zahrani and husain 1998 it has a dry desert climate with generally light winds and high temperatures in most regions saudi arabia hosts thirteen administrative regions riyadh makkah madinah qassim asir tabuk hail jazan najran al baha al jouf the eastern region and the northern borders region each region contains a number of rain gauge stations table 2 summarizes the sub regions and the number of rain gauges within each region fig 1 shows the distribution of the rain gauge stations over saudi arabia the rain gauge data were downloaded from the website of the ministry of water and electricity mowe saudi arabia for the period from october 1 2015 to april 30 2016 website http app mowe gov sa dailyrainsnews rain dams aspx accessed may nov 2016 in saudi arabia each season has distinctly different weather features generally summer rains are caused by the intertropical convergence zone and the northward advance of the southwesterly monsoon sen and al subai 2002 the effects of which decline from north to south not including the highlands where the uplift factor is dominant hag elsafi and el tayib 2016 abdullah and al mazroui 1998 meanwhile winter rains are produced by westerly waves in the upper atmosphere and disturbances from the mediterranean sea and the sudan trough hag elsafi and el tayib 2016 the spatial and temporal variations in the precipitation amounts are a major consideration of water projects and other activities the regional and local climates are both influenced by large scale atmospheric movements along with surficial features in addition atmospheric movement changes constitute important aspects of the regional climate hasanean and almazroui 2015 the rainfall features vary both locally and regionally based on atmospheric circulation patterns resulting from the el niño southern oscillation enso the north atlantic oscillation nao and other variability patterns hag elsafi and el tayib 2016 hasanean and almazroui 2015 almazroui 2011 generally the rainy season in saudi arabia extends from october to april hasanean and almazroui 2015 almazroui 2011 the ministry of water 1984 during the other months almost no precipitation can be observed throughout saudi arabia except for the southwestern region almazroui 2011 the rainfall pattern in the southwestern region has a high spatial variation due to the complex topography of the area which affects the satellite accuracy the topographically driven convective rain in the southwestern region manifests as multi rain events in this specific region of saudi arabia al zahrani and husain 1998 al mazroui 1998 subyani 2004 overall in the desert areas the mean annual precipitation is less than 100 mm while it ranges between 250 and 300 mm in the mountainous areas hag elsafi and el tayib 2016 al zahrani and husain 1998 hasanean and almazroui 2015 3 precipitation data sets 3 1 ground based precipitation data set rain gauges are employed globally as references for precipitation data as they provide a direct physical record of the precipitation at a given point in this study daily rainfall data were collected from all regions of the kingdom of saudi arabia via the online database service provided by the ministry of water and electricity mowe saudi arabia the day in saudi arabia begins 3 h ahead of gmt gmt 3 the gpm products were aggregated to the local day the mowe gauges used in this study are not included among the rain gauges used by the global precipitation climatology center gpcc to perform adjustments to the final run imerg product this allows us to perform a completely independent evaluation of the final run product which is highly dependent on gauge adjustments the mowe database covers the 13 administrative regions each region has many sub regional stations see table 2 the data collection was determined according to the availability of rainfall records during the study period ranging from october 1 2015 to april 30 2016 i e the rainy season a total of 1455 observations were recorded from 189 stations the minimum amount of rainfall detected during the study period was 0 1 mm day the rain gauge network in saudi arabia is unevenly distributed as can be observed from fig 1 which shows that the stations are relatively densely spaced in the western region madinah and in the southwestern regions jazan and asir where the climate is wet as well as in the middle region riyadh where there is a dense population however the eastern and northern regions have relatively sparse rain gauge station densities the variations in the data provided by the mowe were evaluated for each region through a descriptive statistical analysis which is presented in table 3 the statistics shown in table 3 were computed for the rain records observed during the study period from october 2015 to april 2016 3 2 satellite based precipitation data set the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg algorithm was used to estimate the precipitation measurements from the constellation of satellites this algorithm has been sustainably used since the launch of the gpm core observatory satellite to estimate the amount of precipitation the imerg algorithm produces precipitation estimates at a high spatial and temporal resolution of 0 1 0 1 longitude latitude at every half hour interval imerg provides three precipitation products namely early run late run and final run products based on the latency and the need of the product the final run product is a post real time product provided with a latency of four months while the early and late run products are near real time products with latencies of 6 h and 18 h respectively the gpm imerg products were downloaded from the nasa precipitation processing system pps ftp servers early run product nasa 2016d late run product nasa 2016e and final run product nasa 2016f 4 methodology to evaluate the imerg products several steps were carried out fig 2 the process starts with the preparation of the ground measurement data in addition to the gpm data processing and preparation the subsequent step consists of data analysis which includes three major steps an event determination using a script developed by the authors based on visual basic vb net an analysis of gpm files the downloaded gpm files are converted into an ascii format and a coordinate matching process cmp using a vb net script the last step is a comparison of the observed satellite gpm data with the reference data rain gauge data using widely used statistical performance measures 4 1 data processing 4 1 1 ground measurements and data preparation the rainfall ground measurement data were downloaded from the mowe website and the coordinates of each station were obtained the geoplaner website was used to determine the elevation altitude of each rain gauge station http www geoplaner com the coordinates provided were in decimal degrees the utm converter application was used to convert the coordinates from decimal degrees to universal transverse mercator utm coordinates for each rain gauge station http www utmconverter com finally a station id was given to each station consisting of two characters used to identify the region and one number referring to the sequence in the database list 4 1 2 gpm data preparation the gpm data were available in an rt h5 file format rt refers to real time and h5 denotes an hdf5 file the precipitation products cover most of the globe the data were extracted and converted into an ascii format using an algorithm written in r language in addition the data were adjusted to match a saudi arabian day which begins 3 h ahead of gmt gmt 3 4 2 data analysis 4 2 1 events determination the data collected from the mowe contained more than 1450 rain gauge observations covering all of saudi arabia to determine the rainfall events that occurred during the study period a code was developed using vb net to analyze all of the data and to specify the storm events according to a minimum number of occurrences i e the number of rain gauge observations which is set to 30 stations in this study the reason for the selection of 30 stations was to provide rain records from at least 16 of the total available number of rain gauges from all over saudi arabia this 16 was proven to cover more than 40 of the land of saudi arabia 4 2 2 analysis of gpm files the gpm data processing results were analyzed to ensure that the extracted data were located within saudi arabia and that they precisely covered the analysis period additionally headers were added to the processed files ascii files to facilitate the searching process conducted within the developed code 4 2 3 coordinate matching process the coordinate matching process was programmed using vb net this program was aimed at achieving the following goals 1 search for every rain gauge record during each event using the record date and utm zone of the station to select the appropriate gpm file from the processed gpm data 2 read the selected gpm file and explore the utm coordinates for each gpm intersection point to compare each intersection point with the location coordinates of the rain gauge station 3 pick up the closest intersection point when that intersection point lies atop the latitude longitude 0 1 0 1 quadrangle approximately 11 11 km as indicated in fig 3 and 4 compare the rainfall measurements from the specified rain gauge station and the selected gpm intersection 4 3 performance measures with the intent of assessing the performances of the gpm satellite precipitation products six commonly used statistical performance measures were selected these statistical measures are generally grouped into three main classes on the basis of their applications tang et al 2016 ning et al 2016 yong et al 2010 the first group is used to describe the biases and errors within the satellite data in comparison with the rain gauge data it consists of the mean absolute error mae the root mean squared error rmse and the relative bias rb the second group includes only one statistical measurement namely the correlation coefficient cc which describes the consistency between rain gauge data and satellite estimates the third group describes the contingency of the satellite estimates through two statistical parameters namely the probability of detection pod and the critical success index csi tables 4 and 5 summarize these statistical performance measures and their expressions used for the comparison between the rain gauge data and satellite data 4 4 comparison process three main comparison or evaluation processes were conducted namely region based station based and event based evaluations the region based comparison was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the rainfall detected by the gpm satellite for each sub region versus that of the rainfall measured by the rain gauges within the same sub region the principle is to evaluate the overall accuracy of the measurements for the 13 administrative regions in saudi arabia the station based evaluation was performed to investigate the spatial distribution of the accuracy of each rain gauge station and determine their performance the event based evaluation was conducted based on the selection of the largest events that occurred during the study period ranging from october 2015 to april 2016 to ensure that the appropriate record was available to conduct the analysis a minimum threshold of 30 rain records observed by different rain gauges every day was adopted in this study accordingly 11 events resulted from the available records 5 results and discussion 5 1 regional evaluation in this study the imerg products were evaluated both regionally and nationally using six statistical performance measures over all of saudi arabia during the study period the pod and csi measures are shown in fig 4 a f the imerg early run product performed well in detecting the precipitation throughout most of the regions in saudi arabia except for makkah which exhibited a relatively low detection less than0 6 the imerg late run product showed a better performance in detecting the precipitation over all of the regions of saudi arabia including makkah greater than0 7 moreover the final run product showed a robust detection rate of almost 70 throughout saudi arabia with pod and csi measures exceeding 0 9 the rb was tested in all regions over the study period fig 4g i the results for the imerg early run product indicate that the eastern region qassim riyadh and madinah showed a low rb of 1 which is considered a reliable performance in estimating the precipitation the gpm satellite overestimated the precipitation over the northern borders region tabuk al jouf and hail with rb values of more than 20 meanwhile over the remaining regions namely jazan asir al baha and makkah the gpm satellite underestimated the precipitation by more than 5 the imerg late run product showed the same performance for most of the regions except for asir which had a significantly lower rb of about 1 the imerg final run product showed a substantial improvement over all of the saudi arabian regions this can be noticed clearly in fig 4g i where the final run product has the lowest relative bias 1 compared with the other products overall the final run product showed adequate results over 70 of the study area the mae results for the imerg early run product showed low errors over riyadh and the eastern region of less than 10 mm see fig 5 a c while tabuk hail and al jouf exhibited the highest errors more than 25 mm this reveals that the satellite performed poorly in these regions the rest of the regions showed a moderate performance in terms of the mae with values ranging from 15 mm to 25 mm although the imerg late run product revealed a relatively lower mae than the imerg early run product that improvement was not significant in most of the regions however the imerg final run product showed a significant improvement in the accuracy of the precipitation estimates see fig 5a c all of the regions displayed an mae of less than 10 mm except for hail madinah and asir for which the mae ranged between 10 mm and 15 mm the rmse results for the imerg early run product showed a relatively low error for riyadh and the eastern region of less than 10 mm indicating that the satellite performed well over these regions see fig 5d f meanwhile the northern borders region and makkah exhibited a moderate rmse of 20 mm the rest of the regions namely tabuk hail al jouf madinah qassim and al baha had the highest rmse values more than 30 mm revealing that the satellite showed poor performance over these regions moreover the imerg late run product demonstrated considerable improvement through a reduction in the rmse from 40 mm to 20 mm for asir and jazan in contrast the imerg final run product revealed a substantial improvement in the accuracy of the precipitation estimates see fig 5d f all of the regions exhibited an rmse of less than 15 mm except for hail madinah and asir in which the rmse ranged between 15 mm and 30 mm riyadh tabuk and jazan had a high cc more than 0 5 p values less than 0 001 for the imerg early run product meanwhile al jouf and hail displayed a moderate cc from 0 4 to 0 5 p value less than 0 05 in addition to asir and qassim these regions exhibited a higher cc for the late run product as shown in fig 5g i however the northern borders region the eastern region makkah al baha and madinah had a relatively low cc less than 0 2 p value greater than 0 05 for both products in contrast the final run product proved its accuracy with a significant increase in the cc values for almost all of the regions throughout saudi arabia more than 0 5 p value less than 0 05 with the exception of al baha makkah and madinah which had cc values that ranged from 0 1 to 0 2 p value greater than 0 1 5 2 station based evaluation the station based evaluation was performed by testing each station individually then the resultant measures were interpolated using the geographic information systems gis inverse distance weighting idw tool to investigate the variation in each statistical measure over all of saudi arabia beginning with the pod and csi which are presented in fig 6 a f the evaluation of the satellite estimates using these statistical measures for the imerg early run product showed a substantial performance in detecting the precipitation over most parts of saudi arabia more than 0 8 with the exception of the southeastern part of the country which had values ranging from 0 5 to 0 7 the southeastern part of saudi arabia contains the desert of rub al khali and the low pod and csi values reflect the inferior performance of the satellite over deserts additionally a small portion of the western part showed a low detection of precipitation events however these results were improved for the imerg late run product with pod and csi values reaching more than 0 75 in areas of lower detection the final run product revealed a substantial detection of precipitation throughout saudi arabia with values greater than 0 85 for the pod and csi once again the imerg final run product proved that it contains the most accurate precipitation estimates compared with the other imerg products the mae rb and rmse were used to evaluate the accuracy of the different imerg satellite rainfall products over the region the mae results showed that the eastern and western parts of saudi arabia have lower mean absolute errors of less than 10 mm for both the early run and the late run products see fig 7 a c meanwhile the mae results were very high more than 30 mm indicating an inferior performance of the satellite in this region in contrast the imerg final run product revealed a significant improvement in the accuracy of the precipitation estimates see fig 7a c all of the regions had an mae of less than 10 mm with the exception of the southwestern part in which the mae was between 15 mm and 25 mm the rb and rmse values supported the mae results which can be observed clearly in fig 7d i these figure panels present the same trend as the mae results the eastern and western parts demonstrate superiority with remarkable satellite estimations compared with the ground observations for the early run and late run products therefore the imerg final run product proved its superiority in estimating the precipitation with very low errors and biases compared with the other imerg products the cc distribution for the early run product fig 6g i suggested that the satellite estimates over the southern northern and northeastern parts of saudi arabia had a good correlation with the ground observations these results improved significantly for the late run and final run products in the southern and eastern parts of the country however in the northern part the cc was lower in the late run product due to a high bias in the estimation of the precipitation as was mentioned in the first group evaluation nevertheless the cc results for the northern part showed some improvement in the final run product the rest of the country showed high variations in the cc due to the heterogeneity of the rainfall distribution and the variation in the topography of the middle and western parts of saudi arabia 5 3 event based evaluation the imerg products were also validated by exploring the accuracy of each product in the detection of major rain events storms that occurred during the study period over all of saudi arabia the events were considered major or large only when the number of stations that observed precipitation exceeded 30 i e if the rainstorm covered more than 40 of the total land area of saudi arabia on the same date the event determination process revealed that eleven major or large events occurred during the study period as shown in table 6 the performance measures from the event based evaluation are summarized in table 7 the pod and csi showed similar values for each event the reason for this is that the precipitation measurements acquired by the satellite but not observed by a rain gauge station were not included within the analyzed data overall for the imerg early run product the pod and csi varied from 0 68 up to 1 meanwhile the imerg late run product revealed a major improvement in the detection of precipitation by increasing the pod and csi to a range from 0 71 to 1 the final run product showed a high level of perfection in the detection of precipitation events with very high pod and csi values compared with the other imerg products in general the accuracy of detection for precipitation events by the gpm satellite could be considered substantial due to the high pod and csi values for the three products table 7 moreover the cc values for each event for the imerg early run product varied from 0 02 significance level p greater than 0 1 to 0 33 significance level p less than 0 01 except for the events observed in april 2016 these events had cc values that varied from 0 5 significance level p less than 0 005 to 0 75 significance level p less than 0 0005 and they were more correlated than the 2015 events however the cc values for the imerg late run product improved significantly 150 on average for the same events the imerg final run product showed a significant improvement compared with the other products for instance the cc values for the early late and final run products for the event on december 30 2015 were 0 005 p greater than 0 5 0 11 p greater than 0 1 and 0 34 p less than 0 05 respectively the mae and rmse results indicated that the errors in the satellite estimates for all of the events with the exception of those on november 17 and december 2 were relatively low for the early run and late run products respectively however the values of the two parameters decreased significantly when compared with those for the final run product the high errors associated with these two events were caused by a storm extending over the northern middle and western parts of saudi arabia all of which have a complex topography which increases the variability in the rainfall intensity as well as the error in the satellite measurements the mae for the imerg early run product ranged from 5 mm to 36 mm meanwhile it decreased for the imerg late and the imerg final run products by approximately 20 and 45 on average respectively the rb and rmse also exhibited the same trend of the mean absolute error table 7 overall the mae rsme and rb showed significant improvements among the gpm products the mae rsme and rb values decreased from the early run to the late run products and from the late run to the final run products for example the mae rmse and rm values decreased from 6 mm to 3 mm from 8 6 mm to 6 24 mm and from 0 75 to 0 22 respectively for the event on december 30 2015 6 conclusions this research focuses on a validation of the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm mission imerg satellite rainfall products i e the early late and final run products using ground based rain gauge observations as a reference over the kingdom of saudi arabia for the period from october 2015 to april 2016 the evaluation was carried out using six commonly used statistical performance measures the mae rmse rb cc pod and csi three main comparisons or evaluations were conducted namely event based region based and station based evaluations the region based evaluation showed low errors and biases over the eastern region riyadh madinah and qassim for the imerg early run late run and final run products while tabuk al jouf the northern borders region and hail showed relatively high errors and biases for the early run and late run products however for the final run product the errors and biases decreased significantly leaving only tabuk and al jouf with relatively high values a comparison between the satellite estimates and ground observations revealed that riyadh tabuk jazan al jouf and hail had relatively high cc values compared with the other regions for all imerg products the late run product showed a high correlation in asir and qassim furthermore the correlation results showed a remarkable improvement within the final run product with a cc of 0 5 over more than 70 of the total land area of saudi arabia moreover in terms of the satellite detection accuracy all of the imerg products tended to be consistent in detecting precipitation events although the final run product exhibited a higher detection accuracy than the other two products the station based evaluation for the imerg early run product revealed high biases and errors for the stations located in the northern and northwestern parts of saudi arabia while the middle and southern parts showed moderate errors and biases conversely the eastern part and portions of the western part exhibited very low biases and estimation errors meanwhile the station based evaluation revealed a decrease in the biases and estimation errors within the late run product over the southern and western parts of the country however the northern and middle parts of saudi arabia still suffered from high estimation errors and biases in contrast the final run product showed a significant improvement over more than 80 of the country in terms of the correlation between the satellite estimates and ground based observations the southern northern and northeastern parts of saudi arabia were shown to have high correlations for the early run product the results for the late run and final run products were also significantly enhanced in the southern and eastern parts of the country however in the northern part the correlation was lower for the late run product and higher for the final run product the rest of the country showed high variations in the correlation due to the heterogeneous rainfall distribution and variations in the topography of the middle and western parts of saudi arabia furthermore the satellite detection of rainfall events was precise for all of the imerg products although the final run product showed the best detection among all of the products for the event based evaluation the imerg final run product showed a much higher accuracy than the other imerg products for almost all of the events the final run product had a higher correlation between the satellite estimations and ground observations compared with the other imerg products additionally the mean absolute error relative bias and root mean squared error were relatively low for the final run product moreover the probability of detection and critical success index parameters were remarkably higher for the final run product in particular higher errors and biases were detected for two events namely those on november 17 and december 2 using the early run and late run products meanwhile for the final run product the errors and biases for the same events were lower by at least 50 in general the poor results observed over the northern and southern parts of saudi arabia can be interpreted as a result of the high heterogeneity in the rainfall distribution in conjunction with the high variability in the terrestrial topography in these regions in addition many researchers indicated that the satellite detection accuracy for precipitation is quite low in high latitude regions reinforcing the poor results in the southern region moreover the northern region contains a sparse distribution of rain gauge stations relative to the middle and western parts of the country this small number of stations increased the errors and biases in the estimation of the precipitation as the scarcity of rain gauge stations in northern saudi arabia is inadequate to represent the variability in the precipitation distribution overall the results revealed that the imerg final run product may have the potential to play a significant role in complementing or replacing ground precipitation measurements thereby offering a useful approach for ungauged or poorly gauged regions in addition the gpm products are available at relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions making them useful for many hydrological applications in regions such as saudi arabia that have very sparse distributions of rain gauge stations most of which report only at a daily interval moreover the imerg near real time products are available for most of the regions in saudi arabia and thus these products may be useful for early flood warning systems or other applications that require near real time rainfall data although their accuracy must be continuously evaluated acknowledgments the

7366,agricultural irrigation with trans basin water diversion can effectively relieve the water paucity in arid and semi arid regions however this may be accompanied by eco environmental problems e g saline soils rising groundwater levels water quality problems the mechanism of soil water movement under irrigation in the unsaturated zone of arid regions is a key scientific problem that should be solved in order to evaluate agricultural water management and further improve current irrigation practices this study investigated the impact of drip irrigation on soil water movement in the unsaturated zone of a cotton field in an inland arid region the karamay agricultural development area northwest china combining in situ observational physical data with temporal variation in stable isotopic compositions of soil water we described the soil water flow system and mechanism in severe plot 1 and mild plot 2 saline alkali cotton fields the infiltration depths are 0 150 cm for both plots drip irrigation scheduling makes no significant contribution to local groundwater recharge however groundwater can move into the unsaturated zone through capillary rise during cotton flowering and boll periods plot 2 is less prone to having secondary soil salinization than plot 1 due to the existence of a middle layer approximately 100 cm thick which elongated the distance between the root zone and aquifer rise in the water table approximately 60 cm for plot 1 and 50 cm for plot 2 could be caused by lateral groundwater flow instead of vertical infiltration we estimated the soil water storage changes in the unsaturated zone and proposed a conceptual model for deciphering the movement process of soil water this study provides a scientific basis for determining the rise of

irrigation with trans basin water diversion can effectively relieve water scarcity in arid and semiarid regions that experience eco environmental problems such as soil salinity which affect the groundwater levels and water quality dwr 2015 han et al 2017 mao et al 2017 dryland salinity and its environmental impacts have been widely recognized as a major problem in australia and other arid

agricultural practices have led to increases in groundwater recharge rising water tables and escalating salinization which threaten crop growth and plant survival productive agricultural infrastructures water resources and biodiversity pannell and ewing 2006 rengasamy 2010 ali et al 2012 controlling the dryland salinity has been a challenging issue for agricultural development in these regions accurate irrigation schedule and effective fertilization methods are the main ways to ensure crop yield and avoid the deterioration of the soil and water environments conventional gravity furrow flood irrigation for leaching and discharging salt may be an effective method to improve the saline alkali field however owing to the lack of a drainage system in low lying or low topographical relief areas the excessive recharge from irrigation drainage may result in rapidly rising groundwater levels and bring the capillary fringe to within the zone affected by direct evapotranspiration it can also cause increasing salinity in shallow groundwater cui and shao 2005 and secondary saline accumulation around the root zone fan et al 2002 drip irrigation technology evolved quickly after its emergence some 50 years ago in israel siegel 2015 a tiny amount of water and fertilizer through drip irrigation system in a steady flow can be delivered directly to the crop root zone to increase the crop yield potential kang 1998 howell 2001 wan et al 2007 kuklik and hoang 2014 tal 2016 mulching treatment with a daily drip irrigation regime can be considered as a suitable treatment in arid regions not only to reduce water losses but also to enrich soil water content within the flow domain and avoid salt accumulation at the soil surface selim et al 2013 the process of drip irrigation ridge planting plastic mulching has been used to control soil water and salt and manage the saline alkali land in the arid region of northwest china jiao et al 2008 dou and kang 2010 additionally drip irrigation can result in greater irrigation water use efficiency and increased distribution uniformity in the upper soil layers irrigated with overall lower water volume compared with seepage irrigation reyes cabrera et al 2016 there are few reported studies on the mechanism of soil water movement in the unsaturated zone under drip irrigation and its impacts on groundwater recharge most reports have focused on controlling soil water and salt conditions of the topsoil or within the root zone to create a suitable environment for plants growth in arid or semi arid regions physical based techniques of assessing soil water movement can be used for monitoring physical parameters including the soil matric potential smp groundwater level and soil water content

wang et al 2017 and identifying the water source for subsurface flow phillips and gregg 2003 zhao et al 2013a in arid or semi arid regions as is clear from the discussion above the changes to the mechanisms of soil water movement and groundwater recharge infiltration rates and quality due to irrigation may be complex since it is difficult to describe the soil water movement and assess the contribution of irrigation drainage to groundwater recharge when looking at the impacts of irrigation change on recharge it is prudent to use a combination of different approaches and multiple lines of evidence conceptualization of soil water movement in the unsaturated zone can be improved using in situ observation methods combined with stable isotopic analysis to represent and quantify the soil water budget this study is the first to comprehensively characterize the soil water movement in the unsaturated zone in the karamay agricultural development area kada of northwest china fig 1 where from september 1997 to september 2009 the mean rise of water table was 6 9 m han et al 2011 due to extensive irrigation through a water transfer project without drainage system we conducted drip irrigation under matric potential control in severe plot 1 and mild plot 2 saline alkali fields fig 2 during the cotton growing season the combined application of physical based techniques in conjunction with stable isotope tracers δ18o and δ2h have proven effective in field experiment settings for understanding the mechanism of soil water movement in the unsaturated zone of inland arid regions the main objectives of this study are to a describe the different characteristics of soil water movement in two cotton fields with different depths of the groundwater table and different levels of salinization b investigate whether drip irrigation in the cotton fields contributed to the observed groundwater table rise and c develop a conceptual model of the soil water flow system the study is expected to provide suggestions for restraining the rise of groundwater levels and improving agricultural water management for the kada and other similar arid regions 2 study area the kada 84 50 85 20 e 45 22 45 40 n is located in the lacustrine plain in the northwestern junggar basin of xinjiang northwest china and covers an area of 194 3 km2 fig 1 its elevation ranges from 268 m to 288 m above mean sea level with an average land surface slope of 0 26 from southwest to northeast this area is characterized by a typical inland arid climate with mean annual precipitation approximately 111 mm approximately 70 of which falls between july and september average annual water surface evaporation based on pan evaporation experiments is approximately 3545 mm yao et al 2008 due to low precipitation and the gentle slope of the plain effective recharge of precipitation into groundwater can be negligible except for storms and floods the manas river and lake were dried up leading to no stable surface runoff in the kada groundwater in this area is mainly recharged by the infiltration of precipitation and irrigation drainage and lateral subsurface runoff from the piedmont area discharged by evapotranspiration and lateral subsurface runoff cui et al 1997 salinized groundwater with total dissolved solids tds of more than 10 g l and even reaching as high as 56 g l yao et al 2008 is not suitable for drinking industrial or agricultural water demands these water demands have been supported by the transfer of surface water from outside the region han et al 2011 owing to the arid climate gentle topography hydrogeological conditions and irrigation system without an adequate drainage system rising groundwater levels and surface soil salinity have been the limiting factors for sustainable agricultural development in the kada han et al 2011 a previous study by cui et al 1997 verified that 4 m is the critical depth of the water table at which shallow groundwater might be affected by continuous evaporation leading to salt precipitation and accumulation in the surface soil and root zone the area of land in the kada where the water table was within 4 m was 7 4 km2 in august 2005 increased to 99 9 km2 in august 2008 and then to 115 8 km2 in october 2009 due to extensive irrigation without any drainage system in place han et al 2011 3 methods field experiments were carried out in the severe plot 1 and mild plot 2 saline alkali cotton fields of the kada from may 2010 to september 2010 during the main cotton growing seasons fig 1 the plots can be divided by soil salt content within 30 cm below the land surface 6 12 g kg for plot 1 and 2 5 6 g kg for plot 2 according to previous studies wang et al 2011 sun et al 2012 seeds of the cotton hybrid xinluzhong no 26 were sown on may 7 2010 there are 120 days from sowing to harvesting and the plant heights usually ranged from 1 to 2 m wang 2012 more than 95 of the cotton roots are distributed within 60 cm below the surface in northern xinjiang li et al 1999 the cotton growing season in the kada can be divided into the seedling late april to late may budding early june to early july flowering middle july to middle august boll late august to middle september batting late september to middle october and harvest middle october to late november periods wang et al 2011 3 1 experimental design the drip irrigation system consisted of a plastic tank 1000 l 1 m above ground and 15 drip tubes drip tubes with emitters spaced 0 2 m apart were established at the center of each planting bed the discharge rate of the emitter was 0 4 0 6 l h at plot 1 and 2 7 l h at plot 2 respectively the amount of water applied in the first irrigation was 39 2 mm on the day of sowing for leaching salt and raising soil water content swc after sowing irrigation periods were from may 19 to august 26 for plot 1 and from may 25 to august 26 for plot 2 soil water potential swp was observed by tensiometers the depths of observation were 20 cm below the emitters to control irrigation to maintain the smp above 10 kpa at plot 1 and 20 kpa for plot 2 due to the solute potential in saline alkali soils a higher level of smp control is often needed to maintain the required swp jiao et al 2007 the tensiometers were measured three times per day at 8 00 12 00 18 00 during the cotton growing season when the smp at 20 cm decreased below the target values the irrigation water amount could be conducted immediately and the irrigation quota was 9 8 mm for each time the irrigation quota was determined by the plastic tank volume divided by the corresponding irrigation area before the irrigation experiments the initial water table depths were approximately 2 9 m for plot 1 and 3 8 m for plot 2 respectively a diagram of the field experiment design is presented in fig 2 ridge tillage with plastic mulching was applied at plot 1 to increase water table depth and decrease phreatic water evaporation which is beneficial for controlling soil secondary salinization in severe saline alkali soils jiao et al 2007 dou et al 2011 tan et al 2013 the different geometrics of the plant spacing and irrigation spatial pattern at two plots were obtained by repeating the methods outlined in wang et al 2012 the geometric characteristics of the planting and row spacing are set up to achieve certain croppingdensity and yield at the two sites the distance between the drip irrigation tubes is determined to guarantee that each position can be irrigated based on the given discharge rate the ridge was 0 4 m wide and 0 15 m high the distance between the emitters of adjacent drip irrigation belts was 0 8 m fig 2a cotton was planted and plastic mulching was applied in a flat field of plot 2 the distance between emitters of different drip tubes was 1 4 m fig 2b the distance between the drip irrigation tubes is established so that each position can be irrigated based on the given discharge rate generally plastic mulching with a width of 0 8 m covered 2 rows and the cotton crops were planted in 20 cm row spacings plastic mulching with a width of 1 4 m covered four rows and the cotton crops were planted in row spaces 20 40 20 cm each drip irrigation tube was 3 8 m long and 10 cm wide there were 10 and 5 drip irrigation tubes at plot 1 and plot 2 respectively the cotton planting spacing was 0 1 m thus cropping density for both plots was approximately 25 plants m2 to achieve high yield deng et al 2011 3 2 field monitoring and sampling precipitation temperature humidity wind speed wind direction and solar net radiation were observed using davis automatic weather station data were recorded every 15 min except for the tensiometers applied at 20 cm below the emitters for smp control there were corresponding tensiometers and a soil water sampling collector established at different depths below the land surface 100 120 150 180 220 and 260 cm at plot 1 and 120 150 180 210 250 300 and 350 cm at plot 2 and different horizontal distances 0 20 and 40 cm away from the drip tube for plot 1 and 0 35 and 70 cm away from the drip tube for plot 2 fig 2 daily smp data were observed manually at 8 00 a m from may 19 to september 21 for plot 1 and from may 25 to september 23 for plot 2 the depth of the groundwater table was monitored daily at two seepage pits adjacent to the plots at 8 00 a m from may 20 to september 22 for plot 1 and from may 31 to september 22 for plot 2 rainwater samples were collected after the occurrence of each precipitation event from july 27 to september 13 for plot 1 and from july 10 to september 13 for plot 2 irrigation water was sampled from july 19 to august 26 for plot 1 and from july 18 to september 10 for plot 2 soil water samples were collected at the depths shown in fig 2 from may 28 to september 6 in plot 1 and from may 28 to august 20 in plot 2 using a manual vacuum pump during high swc soil samples were vertically collected at an interval of 10 cm for analyzing swc from august 4 to september 18 in plot 1 and from may 3 to september 18 in plot 2 soil samples collected at an interval of 20 cm from the 0 260 cm depth for plot 1 and the 0 350 cm depth for plot 2 were measured for particle analysis using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern uk in the laboratory according to the international soil texture class standard we determined the soil textures for the soil profile of each plot tables 1 and 2 water samples including rainwater irrigation water and soil water were collected in clean 25 ml or 100 ml polyethylene bottles tightly capped and stored at 4 c until analysis all of the samples were sent to the center laboratory for physical and chemical analysis institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research igsnrr chinese academy of sciences cas as soon as possible 3 3 laboratory experiment 3 3 1 soil water content measurement the soil samples collected in aluminum jars 55 35 mm were dried in oven to constant weight under 105 110 c overnight and cooled in a desiccator to avoid reabsorbing water from the atmosphere the swc can be determined by weighing the samples before and after extracting water and dividing the dry soil weight using the following equation 1 θ g w wet w dry w dry 100 2 θ v θ g γ where θ g θ v w wet w dry and γ refer to swc g g soil volumetric water content cm3 cm3 wet soil weight g dry soil g and dry soil bulk density g cm3 respectively soil volumetric water content was used in this study 3 3 2 analysis of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h of the water samples were measured using an isotopic water analyzer picarro l2120 i at the environmental isotope laboratory of igsnrr cas results were expressed as the parts per thousand deviations from the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow the analytical precision is 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h respectively 3 4 calculation methods swp is calculated by smp plus gravity potential the zero points for gravity potential are defined at the ground surface for both plots the water amount of evapotranspiration and transformation from soil water and groundwater can be calculated according to the zero flux plane method if the stable convergent zero flux plane czfp exists during the experimental period evapotranspiration can be estimated from water balance calculation of the unsaturated zone above the czfp and the transformed water amount between the soil water and groundwater can be obtained from the water balance calculation of soil layers below the czfp 4 results 4 1 soil water potential 4 2 1 plot 1 fig 3 shows the swp dynamics and variations of water table depth under the irrigation precipitation infiltration at plot 1 the swp at 100 120 and 150 cm increased with time during the cotton seedling budding and flowering periods during the cotton boll period the swp at these depths decreased with time the swp at 100 120 and 150 cm ranged from 291 2 to 138 8 cm the swp gradients at plot 1 during the observation are shown in table s1 supplementary the swp gradients were negative at 100 120 and 120 150 cm and almost positive at 150 180 180 220 and 220 260 cm during the seedling budding and flowering periods the groundwater table depth decreased and the swp at 180 220 and 260 cm slowly increased with time during the cotton boll period the groundwater table depth remained relatively stable at approximately 230 cm below the ground surface and the swps decreased with time the swp at 180 220 and 260 cm ranged from 296 3 to 171 6 cm during the observation period 4 2 2 plot 2 fig 4 shows the swp dynamics and the groundwater table depth changes during the observation at plot 2 during the cotton seedling and budding periods with irrigation the swp maintains an oscillation balance with time at different depths and the groundwater table slowly increases during the flowering and boll periods near the end of the irrigation event the swp at 120 cm decreases with time the swp at 120 cm ranges from 541 9 to 109 0 cm the swp gradients in plot 2 during observation are shown in table s2 the soil water displayed a downward trend of movement with the mostly negative swp gradients at the 150 180 cm and 210 250 cm depth ranges and an upward trend with the mostly positive swp gradients at the 120 150 cm and 180 210 cm depth ranges the swp increased with time at the czfp approximately 180 cm and decreased with time at divergent zero flux planes 150 and 210 cm depths the swps at 150 180 and 210 cm ranged from 481 5 to 49 71 cm and remained relatively stable the positive swp gradients at 250 300 cm close to the groundwater capillary zone show an upward movement of soil water because it approaches the capillary zone the swp gradients below 300 cm are close to 0 with decreasing water table depth during the seedling budding and flowering periods the swps at 250 300 and 350 cm increased with time due to groundwater capillary rise during the boll period the water table depth decreased to approximately 330 cm below the ground surface and remained relatively stable the swps at 250 300 and 350 cm varied between 514 2 m and 42 1 cm 4 2 soil water content swc is an important factor affecting plant growth and it is also a key parameter for assessing the water balance in arid regions from field experiments we obtained the soil water content data from both plots plot 1 fig 5 shows the variations of swc with soil texture profile the swc at 0 60 cm ranges from 0 2 to 0 45 with depth with clear increasing trend during the irrigation period august 4 and august 18 and a decreasing trend during the non irrigation period september 11 and september 18 the swc at 50 60 cm decreased to approximately 0 3 the swc increased in the silt layer from approximately 0 3 to 0 45 at 60 120 cm it decreased from approximately 0 45 to 0 2 at 120 150 cm for the loamy sand and sandy loamy layers swc at 150 260 cm increased from approximately 0 2 to 0 45 with depth 4 2 1 plot 2 fig 6 shows the vertical distribution of swc with the soil texture profile the swc at 0 120 cm ranges from approximately 0 1 to 0 4 with depth with an increasing trend during the irrigation period august 3 and decreasing trend during the non irrigation period september 11 and september 18 a distinct decrease of the swc can be observed at a range of 0 1 0 2 at 40 50 cm the swc at 120 160 cm decreased sharply from 0 4 to approximately 0 2 the swc increased from approximately 0 2 to 0 35 at 150 220 cm for the silt layer and decreased from approximately 0 35 to 0 05 at 220 250 cm for the loamy sand layer the swc at 250 350 cm increased from 0 05 to 0 4 4 3 isotopic compositions in water the stable isotopic profiles of soil water can be controlled by climate conditions soil texture the evapotranspiration process antecedent moisture precipitation and irrigation events and vegetation cover figs 7 and 8 show the δ18o δ2h in the soil profile and the variations of δ2h in soil water samples with depth for plot 1 and plot 2 respectively the general statistics of isotopic compositions in water samples across all of the sampling time are shown in table 3 the precipitation and irrigation waters have similar isotopic features during the monitoring period for both plots precipitation in plot 1 ranged from 4 8 to 1 0 mean 3 6 for δ18o and from 44 to 18 mean 30 for δ2h respectively at plot 2 precipitation water was characterized by δ18o ranging from 5 7 to 1 0 mean 3 3 and δ2h ranging from 51 to 9 mean 30 respectively irrigation water was characterized by δ18o ranging from 15 2 to 14 1 mean 14 9 and δ2h ranging from 113 to 106 mean 110 respectively the local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 7 21δ18o 4 50 was referenced from a previous study li et al 2009 the isotopic compositions of precipitation irrigation water and most soil water samples are located below the lmwl irrigation water is obviously more depleted in the isotopic compositions than that in precipitation we assumed a minor change in the isotopic compositions of groundwater during the experimental period the isotopic compositions of groundwater samples collected from two monitoring wells t8 near plot 1 and t20 near plot 2 han et al 2011 can be used as the isotopic compositions of groundwater for plot 1 and plot 2 respectively they are very different from each other as shown in table 3 at plot 1 the soil water samples ranged from 15 3 to 6 0 mean 10 0 for δ18o and from 102 to 65 mean 83 for δ2h respectively the isotopic compositions of the soil water at 100 cm are more enriched relative to the irrigation water the points of soil waters at 120 and 150 cm on fig 7 are close to the irrigation water quite different from the soil water at 100 cm at 180 220 and 260 cm the points of the soil water samples are gradually approaching that of groundwater regarding the isotopic compositions of the soil water samples at plot 2 they ranged from 10 5 to 4 3 mean 6 9 for δ18o and from 78 to 57 mean 66 for δ2h respectively the isotopic compositions of soil water at 120 cm were closer to that of irrigation water compared to that at other depths the soil water samples collected from 180 210 250 300 and 350 cm are characterized by the enrichment of isotopic compositions relative to the irrigation water and soil water at 120 cm 5 discussion 5 1 impact of infiltration evapotranspiration on soil water the soil water at 0 150 cm for both plots is influenced by the irrigation precipitation infiltration and evapotranspiration showing that the swps and swcs increase during the irrigation period and decrease during the non irrigation period figs 3 6 the source of plant water is mainly from the deep rooted zone during the dry season and from shallow sources during the wet season dawson and pate 1996 wang et al 2017 owing to the deep root water uptake the swps at 100 120 and 150 cm at plot 1 decrease with time during the boll period and the swps at 120 cm at plot 2 decrease with time during the flowering and boll periods figs 3 and 4 the results indicate that some of the cotton root system has reached these depths during the flowering and boll periods due to the increased water consumption during these stages which is also proved by related research in north xinjiang li et al 2017 the swcs at 0 150 cm for both plots increased with depth figs 5 and 6 indicating that evapotranspiration decreases with depth similarly the variations in the isotopic compositions of soil water at 0 150 cm for both plots decreased with depth table 3 figs 7 and 8 due to the surface layers having been impacted by infiltration and evapotranspiration more than the deeper layers hsieh et al 1998 wan and liu 2016 change in the swcs at 0 60 cm with depth during irrigation and non irrigation periods for both plots is greater than at other depths this indicates that 0 60 cm is the main interval containing the root zone for cotton fields under mulched drip irrigation in north xinjiang li et al 1999 which may be influenced by irrigation precipitation infiltration and evapotranspiration including direct evaporation to a greater extent compared with below the strong root water uptake may result in the observed decrease of the swcs at depths of 40 60 cm for both plots figs 5 and 6 guo et al 2005 the swc mainly controlled by the soil texture at 60 150 cm for both plots decreased sharply at approximately 120 140 cm for plot 1 and 140 160 cm for plot 2 figs 5 and 6 with changes in the soil textures at different depths tables 1 and 2 the irrigation water under mulching drip mode can infiltrate and accumulate within a certain depth range from the ground surface resulting in a clear decline of the swc at these depths therefore it can be identified that infiltration depths are approximately 150 cm for both plots with 0 60 cm the main infiltration depths these results are consistent with a previous study by qiao and wang 2014 which reported that the depth affected by evapotranspiration is 0 120 cm in an inland arid basin in northwest china continued irrigation infiltration can lead to the formation of a desalination zone within 0 40 cm and irrigation drainage below 80 cm depth is less than 10 6 mm at plot 1 wang et al 2011 wang 2012 5 2 mechanisms of soil water movement as mentioned above infiltration depth of 150 cm has been identified for both plots the isotopic compositions of soil water at 100 cm for plot 1 were more enriched compared with that of 120 and 150 cm fig 7 this enrichment trend may occur as a result of several processes the effect of soil water evaporation on the isotopic composition and occurrence of more enriched isotopic compositions in soil water at 100 cm for plot 1 compared with that at 120 and 150 cm depths fig 7 it can be resulted from the evaporation near the ground surface in arid area zimmermann et al 1967 the soil water at 120 and 150 cm was less affected by evapotranspiration compared with 100 cm due to silty soil being an obstacle fig 5 additionally the soil water can be affected by the mixing processes between new water input i e precipitation and irrigation water and old water i e antecedent moisture within the unsaturated zone gazis and feng 2004 similarly because the soil water at 120 cm for plot 2 was more affected by the infiltration of irrigation drainage the isotopic compositions were closer to that of the irrigation water compared with other depths at plot 2 fig 8 the isotopic compositions of soil water at 100 cm for plot 1 were closer to that of the soil water at 120 cm for plot 2 table 3 which may indicate a similar degree of evaporation and mixing process mentioned above if only piston flow exists at plot 1 the soil water at these depths may be less influenced by irrigation precipitation infiltration and the isotopic compositions at 120 and 150 cm might approach the antecedent water with enriched isotopic composition however the isotopic compositions are actually close to that of the irrigation water albeit with highly scattered ranges this indicates that the soil water at these depths for plot 1 may also be recharged by the infiltration of irrigation water through preferential flow since some of the cotton root system reached these depths during the flowering and boll periods the macropores developed in the unsaturated zone can lead to preferential flow in the root zone beven and germann 1982 gehrels et al 1998 preferential flow is commonplace in soils whose moisture is substantially less than saturated soil and may be greater in drier media padilla et al 1999 nimmo 2016 the macropores could be caused by the soil heterogeneity kung 1990 such as the sandy loam soil distributed at the depth range of 120 150 cm additionally the scattered isotope data at 120 and 150 cm indicate that the water source may have come from a wide variety of recharge sources song et al 2009 since the soil water at 150 250 cm for plot 2 is rarely affected by irrigation precipitation infiltration evapotranspiration or capillary upflow from groundwater the swp and swc at these depths have relatively minor changes with time figs 4 and 6 the isotopic compositions of the soil water samples collected from 180 210 and 250 cm depths at plot 2 are more enriched relative to that of the irrigation water fig 8 which suggests that the old soil water may be subjected to strong evaporation in arid regions prior to irrigation zimmermann et al 1967 and be moved into these depths from upper soil layers kortelainen and karhu 2004 the soil water at 150 260 cm for plot 1 and 250 350 cm for plot 2 is affected by the groundwater capillary rise with positive swp gradients figs 3 and 4 tables s1 and s2 the swcs at these sections are characterized by high values during the observation period figs 5 and 6 with the relatively stable swps response to variations in groundwater table depth figs 3 and 4 suggesting the approaching saturation in these sections the isotopic compositions of soil water at 180 220 and 260 cm for plot 1 and 300 and 350 cm for plot 2 gradually approach that of groundwater with depth figs 7 and 8 the enriched signals of the isotopic compositions in the deeper soil water often show the evaporation prior to infiltration or the mixture of groundwater through capillary rise komor and emerson 1994 nativ et al 1995 the swcs below 220 cm for plot 1 and below 330 cm for plot 2 are close to the saturated soil water content approximately 0 42 for plot 1 and 0 4 for plot 2 respectively figs 5 and 6 the swp gradients at theses depths are close to 0 indicating these sections below 220 cm for plot 1 and 330 cm for plot 2 are within the capillary saturated zones it is remarkable that there is no obvious vertical oscillation of the isotopic compositions in soil water at plot 2 relative to that of plot 1 under the heterogeneous soil conditions figs 7 and 8 based on the swp gradients at 120 250 cm in plot 2 table s2 the soil water migrates downward at 150 180 cm and 210 250 cm depths and upward at 120 150 cm and 180 210 cm depths i e variable directions possibly caused by strong texture stratification table 2 song et al 2009 indicating that the soil water at different sections of 150 250 cm can be mixed to some extent it may result in the stable distribution of isotopic compositions with depths at 150 250 cm in plot 2 the soil at 250 350 cm is characterized by greater swp gradient compared with plot 1 tables s1 and s2 and thus may be more susceptible to groundwater through capillary rise resulting in the stable distribution of isotopic compositions at 250 350 cm at plot 2 the isotopic compositions of groundwater at both plots are quite distinct from each other table 3 figs 7 and 8 the variability of the regional hydrogeological conditions described by han et al 2011 can explain these differences as being caused by mixing with the antecedent water near the water level fluctuation zone at the two plots with different water table depths groundwater at both plots is recharged by the lateral groundwater flow from different directions supplementary fig s1 which may result in the variational isotopic compositions han et al 2011 5 3 conceptual model of the soil water movement the soil water flow systems under the current irrigation mode in both plots in the kada can be summarized in fig 9 the vertical movement of soil water in the unsaturated zone can be divided into three layers i the surface layer 0 150 cm for both plots which has an obvious response to the irrigation precipitation infiltration and evapotranspiration ii middle layer 150 250 cm for plot 2 which is rarely affected by irrigation precipitation infiltration or groundwater capillary rise and iii deep layer below 150 cm for plot 1 and below 250 cm for plot 2 which is susceptible to the rising capillary water as described above the infiltration depths are 0 150 cm for both plots under the mulched drip irrigation the soil water migration can lower salt accumulation in the root zone within 60 cm depth which is beneficial for cotton growth in the kada the results of the previous field experiments conducted by wang et al 2014 and chen et al 2016 show that the soil salinity of the soil profile 0 120 cm increases with increasing sampling depth it was also observed by wang et al 2011 that under the continued drip irrigation implemented during 2008 2010 the soil salinity can be washed by the soil water migration leading to a clear desalination zone within the 0 40 cm in plot 1 the depth range of 0 40 cm is the main root zone of cotton under mulched drip irrigation wang 2012 in addition the infiltration depths 0 150 cm at both plots indicate that irrigation water is unlikely to recharge into groundwater however the rise in the water table can lead to a corresponding rise in the height of the capillary water zone which can even reach the main root zone northey et al 2006 consequently hydrological processes such as precipitation irrigation drainage evapotranspiration capillary upflow from groundwater fertilizer dissolution and salt pollutants input at the surface layer can easily affect the soil water system through the relatively thinner unsaturated zone during the irrigation period water reallocation may result in the deterioration of dryland salinity and reduce the crop yield bouksila et al 2013 the soil water movement at the middle layer of plot 2 has rarely responded to the infiltration of precipitation irrigation drainage or groundwater capillary rise the swc swp and isotopic compositions of soil water in the middle layer have minor changes with time compared with the surface and deep layers figs 4 6 and 8 the middle layer can be regarded as a steady state hydrologic layer which has been defined and recognized by many previous studies of china s loess plateau wan and liu 2016 tan et al 2017a b although the middle layer of plot 2 cannot stop the downward movement of water and salt from the root zone it extends the distance between the root zone and the groundwater table therefore plot 2 may be less prone to secondary salinization compared with plot 1 5 4 estimation of soil water storage change in the unsaturated zone soil water storage sws is a critical parameter for determining vertical water and energy fluxes in hydrological processes which are associated with precipitation irrigation surface runoff groundwater and plant growth brocca et al 2009 heathman et al 2012 penna et al 2013 li et al 2015 it is also an important aspect for assessing water use efficiency for agricultural water management in this study the flowering and boll periods i e the critical growth periods for cotton can be selected for estimating the sws during the critical cotton growing periods for plot 1 the calculation intervals include the late flowering period august 4 to august 18 the early and middle boll period august 18 to september 11 and the late boll period september 11 to september 18 for plot 2 the calculation intervals range from the late flowering period to the late boll period august 3 to september 11 september 11 to september 18 the soil column per unit area below the drip irrigation belt can be taken as a system for estimating soil water storage change fig 10 the top interfaces of the soil columns are the ground surface for both plots the bottom interfaces of the columns namely the top interfaces of capillary saturation zones are located at 220 cm and 330 cm below the ground surface for plot 1 and plot 2 respectively the water in the calculating systems is originated from precipitation p irrigation i and the water transfer amount d between the unsaturated and saturated zone if the d is positive groundwater though the capillary water rise will recharge the soil water system on the contrary if d is negative the soil water can reach the water table and recharge the aquifer the discharges of the column system mainly include evapotranspiration et which refers to the evaporation es from the unsaturated zone and transpiration ep from the cotton field the variations of water input and output in the columns result in the soil water storage change swsc δ w which can be expressed by the following eqs 3 and 4 precipitation p and irrigation i can be obtained by practical observation 3 δ w p i d et 4 δ w δ w s δ w m δ w d where δ w s δ w m and δ w d δ w m and δ w d refer to the swsc at the surface middle and deep layers respectively the swsc of each layer can be estimated by summing up soil water storage change of each sub layer eqs 57 5 δ ws δ θ s ts 6 δ wm δ θ m tm 7 δ wd δ θ d td where δ θ s δ θ m and δ θ d correspond to the swsc in the surface middle and deep layers respectively and ts tm and td refer to the corresponding thickness of each layer the vertical variations of the swp during the calculation periods are shown in fig s2 for plot 1 and fig s3 for plot 2 respectively there are stable czfps 150 cm for plot 1 and 250 cm for plot 2 respectively which are also the interfaces located between the middle and deep layers during the calculation periods indicating that the soil water above the interfaces cannot be affected by groundwater capillary rise while the soil water below the interfaces cannot respond to the irrigation precipitation infiltration the percolation of the irrigation drainage cannot reach the groundwater table during the calculation periods et can be estimated by eq 8 according to water balance of the surface and middle layers for both plots 8 et p i δ w s δ w m because the directions of soil water movement at 150 220 cm are variable with depth and time the water transfer amount d between the soil water and groundwater at plot 1 can be calculated by eqs 9 and 10 the water transfer flux d 180 at the interface 180 cm depth is equal to the calculated soil water storage change δ w 150 180 at 150 180 cm eq 9 the water transfer flux d 220 at the interface between soil water and groundwater can be obtained from eq 10 based on calculating swsc at 180 220 cm δ w 180 220 and d 180 at the interface of the 180 cm depth 9 d 180 δ w 150 180 10 d 220 d 180 δ w 180 220 whereas the soil water at 250 330 cm driven by the capillary water rise migrates upward with time and depth the water transfer amount d between the soil water and groundwater at plot 2 can be expressed by eq 11 11 d δ w d the calculated results for the swsc and water balance components of the unsaturated zone at plot 1 are shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively the sws within 0 150 cm decreases from august 4 to august 18 at the late flowering period and august 18 to september 11 at the early and middle boll periods due to the excess of evapotranspiration relative to the irrigation precipitation amount the sws increases again from september 11 to september 18 at the late boll period probably resulting from the lateral soil water input during the non irrigation period the swsc at 150 180 cm varies from 1 7 mm to 21 7 mm and then to 3 2 mm during three calculating periods respectively the increasing sws within 150 180 cm during the first two stages may be caused by the upward movement of soil water from the interface of 180 cm depth to the soil water in the upper layer at 150 180 cm fig s2 the swsc at 180 220 cm during the calculating periods changes from 6 0 mm to 33 7 mm and then to 3 9 mm respectively the increasing sws within 180 220 cm may result from the bidirectional soil water confluence including the downward movement of the soil water at the interface of the 180 cm depth and the upward movement of the soil water from the 220 cm depth fig s2 during the three periods table 5 the water transfer amount between the soil water and groundwater at plot 1 varies from 7 7 mm to 55 4 mm and then to 7 1 mm with the water table depth ranges which change from 2 5 to 2 42 m 2 42 2 3 m to 2 3 2 35 m respectively it suggests that groundwater through capillary water rise recharges into the upper soil water system following the increasing groundwater table the groundwater amount migrated into the soil water system accounts for 6 5 47 8 and then to 65 1 of total water inputs in the unsaturated zone during the three periods with an increasing trend the contribution of irrigation water changes from 83 3 to 50 8 and then to 0 of total water inputs of the unsaturated zone at three periods showing an obvious decreasing trend the results showing the swsc and the water balance components of the unsaturated zone at plot 2 are shown in tables 6 and 7 respectively the sws within 0 150 cm table 6 decreases during the two periods due to evapotranspiration exceeding the irrigation precipitation infiltration the increasing sws within 150 250 cm during the first period august 3 to september 11 may be caused by the lateral soil water flow and then it decreases during the second stage i e the late boll period probably resulting from the deep root water uptake the upward movement of soil water from the 330 cm depth may result in the increasing sws at 250 330 cm during both periods fig s3 the positive amount of water transfer between soil water and groundwater indicates the occurrence of groundwater entering the vadose zone through capillary water movement it can be seen from table 7 that the contribution of groundwater can account for 6 5 and 74 2 of total water inputs in the unsaturated zone during the two periods while the irrigation water occupies 73 6 and 0 of total water inputs in the unsaturated zone in summary the infiltration of irrigation drainage has a minimal effect on groundwater for both plots however groundwater can enter into the unsaturated zone through the rising capillary water during the calculating periods combined with the swp dynamics during the observation period figs 3 and 4 tables s1 and s2 the stable czfps can be identified at 150 cm for plot 1 and at 250 cm for plot 2 respectively the results suggest that the current mulching drip irrigation can restrain the infiltration capacity into the groundwater system and effectively impede the groundwater table rise which can prevent the secondary salinization of soil in the kada 5 5 recharge source of the shallow groundwater due to the scarce precipitation and lack of surface runoff in this desert area the main sources of soil water originates from irrigation drainage and groundwater as already mentioned the infiltration depth range was approximately 0 150 cm for both plots indicating that under the mulching drip irrigation mode the infiltration of precipitation irrigation rarely changed the soil water flow pattern below 150 cm depth in the unsaturated zone and cannot be attributed to groundwater recharge it is also consistent with the fact that irrigation precipitation water amounts of less than 15 mm is unlikely to recharge into groundwater in the inland arid areas of northwestern china due to the high potential evaporation wei 1988 however the water table rose during the observation period approximately 60 cm for plot 1 and 50 cm for plot 2 fig 3a and fig 4a respectively in the kada the drip irrigation mode has been applied for cotton planting since 2006 while for the woodlands located at the eastern part of the kada and trees on both sides of the road in this region fig 1 and fig s4 flooding irrigation was employed chen et al 2016 the woodlands are approximately 3 9 and 1 3 km away from plot 1 and plot 2 fig 1 and fig s4 respectively combined with the analysis of water table contours in 2009 by a previous study fig s1 han et al 2011 it can be reasonably concluded that the groundwater underlying the cotton fields may be recharged by the lateral groundwater flow which is likely derived from the infiltration of flood irrigation from the adjacent woodlands or trees on the roadside before the exploitation of land in the kada in september 1997 the groundwater flow direction was towards the northeast fig s1 the hydraulic gradient of shallow groundwater changed from 3 1 in the upstream area to approximately 0 5 in the eastern part han et al 2011 the water table depth ranged from 10 m in the upstream to 18 m in the downstream the prevailing groundwater flow direction changed from the ne direction in september 1997 to the sw direction in october 2009 in comparison with the groundwater flow field in 1997 an obvious high water table area occurred in the eastern part in 2009 the hydraulic gradient of shallow groundwater in the cotton area varied from 0 5 to 2 in the low water table area to 0 8 2 3 in the high water table area the prevailing hydraulic gradient in october 2009 fig s1 was approximately 1 6 for plot 1 and 2 0 for plot 2 respectively the unconfined aquifers at both plots are composed of gravel silt and fine sand with a hydraulic conductivity of 0 4 0 9 m d and specific yield 0 08 0 10 cui et al 1997 the horizontal darcy s velocity of groundwater was calculated as 6 4 10 4 to 1 4 10 3 m d for plot 1 and 8 10 4 to 1 8 10 3 m d for plot 2 respectively during the observation period in 2010 the observed rise rates of the water table are approximately 4 8 mm d at plot 1 and 4 3 mm d at plot 2 and the corresponding groundwater recharge is 4 8 10 4 m d for plot 1 and 4 3 10 4 m d for plot 2 the horizontal darcy s velocity of groundwater is close to or more than the regional groundwater recharge rate it can be speculated that the lateral groundwater inflow is indeed responsible for the groundwater table rise on this basis 6 summary and environmental implications in order to investigate the mechanism of soil water movement in the unsaturated zone and the impact of irrigation precipitation infiltration on groundwater recharge under the mulched drip irrigation in an arid region we conducted the field experiments in severe saline alkali plot 1 and mild saline alkali plot 2 cotton fields in the kada during the cotton growing season combining physical based techniques in conjunction with stable isotope tracers δ18o and δ2h in the field experiment settings we described the mechanisms of soil water movement in the two cotton fields investigated whether the drip irrigation in the cotton fields has contributed to the observed groundwater table rise and propose a conceptual model of the soil water flow system the infiltration depths are approximately 150 cm for both plots the capillary upflow from groundwater can migrate into the unsaturated zone during the flowering and boll periods however the current mulching drip irrigation mode in the cotton fields may be not responsible for the groundwater table rise which was found to rise approximately 60 cm for plot 1 and 50 cm for plot 2 during the observation period it may have resulted from the lateral groundwater inflow driven by the flood irrigation from the adjacent woodlands rather than the vertical infiltration of irrigation drainage the current drip irrigation mode in the cotton fields can be conductive to salt leaching out of the main root zone i e within the 60 cm depth below ground surface and can effectively mitigate the degree of soil salinization in this area plot 2 was less prone to secondary salinization in comparison with plot 1 due to the middle layer extending the distance between the root zone and groundwater the mulching drip irrigation can be considered a suitable technique in other similar arid regions it is imperative to control the water table rise in order to optimize the management of agricultural water resources and improve the ecological environment in this arid region based on our analysis of the field monitoring data previous investigations on the regional scale and lessons drawn from australian agricultural dryland we offer the following recommendations i to obtain a full understanding of the current environmental implications the optimum water saving irrigation schedule can be continually explored to achieve the goal of increasing the cotton yield ii to establish drainage systems e g pumping groundwater deep open drains in this area that can effectively control dryland salinity and shallow water tables in the arid region especially the cotton fields in xinjiang liu et al 2014 iii a water treatment plant can be built in this area for treating and reclaiming the local salinized groundwater to be reused for agricultural irrigation or domestic and industrial purposes leading to an improvement of the recycling rate of water resources and iv given that the shallow water tables and high salinity groundwater the local farmers may consider the option of various salt tolerant plants e g salt bush and lucerne pavelic et al 1997 cotton and barley ranatunga et al 2010 and atriplex aucheri and suaeda salsa zhao et al 2013b additionally tree plantation on seepage areas may be a useful method for increasing the groundwater discharge rate and reducing the local salinity due to the high transpiration rates observed in trees planted over shallow water tables in arid regions george et al 1999 stirzaker et al 1999 cramer et al 1999 different types of trees can be properly planted around the cotton field according to the soil salinity supplementary table s3 wei and ge 2001 however over planting of trees in arid zones will decrease the groundwater recharge and cause a rapid drop in water table levels which may result in the death of planted trees yin et al 2015 establishment of deep rooted pastures can not only reduce evaporation and the groundwater recharge rate but also control the dryland salinity pavelic et al 1997 generally human activities can change the hydrological cycle and strengthen spatiotemporal reallocation of water resources in arid regions it is vital to understand the mechanism of soil water movement in unsaturated zones and its impact on groundwater recharge for sustainable water utilization and maintenance of a healthy ecosystem in arid regions

7366,agricultural irrigation with trans basin water diversion can effectively relieve the water paucity in arid and semi arid regions however this may be accompanied by eco environmental problems e g saline soils rising groundwater levels water quality problems the mechanism of soil water movement under irrigation in the unsaturated zone of arid regions is a key scientific problem that should be solved in order to evaluate agricultural water management and further improve current irrigation practices this study investigated the impact of drip irrigation on soil water movement in the unsaturated zone of a cotton field in an inland arid region the karamay agricultural development area northwest china combining in situ observational physical data with temporal variation in stable isotopic compositions of soil water we described the soil water flow system and mechanism in severe plot 1 and mild plot 2 saline alkali cotton fields the infiltration depths are 0 150 cm for both plots drip irrigation scheduling makes no significant contribution to local groundwater recharge however groundwater can move into the unsaturated zone through capillary rise during cotton flowering and boll periods plot 2 is less prone to having secondary soil salinization than plot 1 due to the existence of a middle layer approximately 100 cm thick which elongated the distance between the root zone and aquifer rise in the water table approximately 60 cm for plot 1 and 50 cm for plot 2 could be caused by lateral groundwater flow instead of vertical infiltration we estimated the soil water storage changes in the unsaturated zone and proposed a conceptual model for deciphering the movement process of soil water this study provides a scientific basis for determining the rise of

infrastructures water resources and biodiversity pannell and ewing 2006 rengasamy 2010 ali et al 2012 controlling the dryland salinity has been a challenging issue for agricultural development in these regions accurate irrigation schedule and effective fertilization methods are the main ways to ensure crop yield and avoid the deterioration of the soil and water environments conventional gravity furrow flood irrigation for leaching and discharging salt may be an effective method to improve the saline alkali field however owing to the lack of a drainage system in low lying or low topographical relief areas the excessive recharge from irrigation drainage may result in rapidly rising groundwater levels and bring the capillary fringe to within the zone affected by direct evapotranspiration it can also cause increasing salinity in shallow groundwater cui and shao 2005 and secondary saline accumulation around the root zone fan et al 2002 drip irrigation technology evolved quickly after its emergence some 50 years ago in israel siegel 2015 a tiny amount of water and fertilizer through drip irrigation system in a steady flow can be delivered directly to the crop

process of drip irrigation ridge planting plastic mulching has been used to control soil water and salt and manage the saline alkali land in the arid region of northwest china jiao et al 2008 dou and kang 2010 additionally drip irrigation can result in greater irrigation water use efficiency and increased distribution uniformity in the upper soil layers irrigated with overall lower water volume compared with seepage irrigation reyes cabrera et al 2016 there are few reported studies on the mechanism of soil water movement in the unsaturated zone under drip irrigation and its impacts on groundwater recharge most reports have focused on controlling soil water and salt conditions of the topsoil or within the root zone to create a suitable environment for plants growth in arid or semi

wang et al 2017 and identifying the water source for subsurface flow phillips and gregg 2003 zhao et al 2013a in arid or semi arid regions as is clear from the discussion above the changes to the mechanisms of soil water movement and groundwater recharge infiltration rates and quality due to irrigation may be complex since it is difficult to describe the soil water movement and assess the contribution of irrigation drainage to groundwater recharge when looking at the impacts of irrigation change on recharge it is prudent to use a combination of different approaches and multiple lines of evidence conceptualization of soil water movement in the unsaturated zone can be improved using in situ observation methods combined with stable isotopic analysis to represent and quantify the soil water budget this study is the first to comprehensively characterize the soil water movement in the unsaturated zone in the karamay agricultural development area kada of northwest china fig 1 where from september 1997 to september 2009 the mean rise of water table was 6 9 m han et al 2011 due to extensive irrigation through a water transfer project without drainage system we conducted drip irrigation under matric potential control in severe plot 1 and mild plot 2 saline alkali fields fig 2 during the cotton growing season the combined application of physical based techniques in conjunction with stable isotope tracers δ18o and δ2h have proven effective in field experiment settings for understanding the mechanism of soil water movement in the unsaturated zone of inland arid regions the main objectives of this study are to a describe the different characteristics of soil water movement in two cotton fields with different depths of the groundwater table and different levels of salinization b investigate whether drip irrigation in the cotton fields contributed to the observed groundwater table rise and c develop a conceptual model of the soil water flow system the study is expected to provide suggestions for restraining the rise of groundwater levels and improving agricultural water management for the kada and other similar arid regions 2 study area the kada 84 50 85 20 e 45 22 45 40 n is located in the lacustrine plain in the northwestern junggar basin of xinjiang northwest china and covers an area of 194 3 km2 fig 1 its elevation ranges from 268 m to 288 m above mean sea level with an average land surface slope of 0 26 from southwest to northeast this area is characterized by a typical inland arid climate with mean annual precipitation approximately 111 mm approximately 70 of which falls between july and september average annual water surface evaporation based on pan evaporation experiments is approximately 3545 mm yao et al 2008 due to low precipitation and the gentle slope of the plain effective recharge of precipitation into groundwater can be negligible except for storms and floods the manas river and lake were dried up leading to no stable surface runoff in the kada groundwater in this area is mainly recharged by the infiltration of precipitation and irrigation drainage and lateral subsurface runoff from the piedmont area discharged by evapotranspiration and lateral subsurface runoff cui et al 1997 salinized groundwater with total dissolved solids tds of more than 10 g l and even reaching as high as 56 g l yao et al 2008 is not suitable for drinking industrial or agricultural water demands these water demands have been supported by the transfer of surface water from outside the region han et al 2011 owing to the arid climate gentle topography hydrogeological conditions and irrigation system without an adequate drainage system rising groundwater levels and surface soil salinity have been the limiting factors for sustainable agricultural development in the kada han et al 2011 a previous study by cui et al 1997 verified that 4 m is the critical depth of the water table at which shallow groundwater might be affected by continuous evaporation leading to salt precipitation and accumulation in the surface soil and root zone the area of land in the kada where the water table was within 4 m was 7 4 km2 in august 2005 increased to 99 9 km2 in august 2008 and then to 115 8 km2 in october 2009 due to extensive irrigation without any drainage system in place han et al 2011 3 methods field experiments were carried out in the severe plot 1 and mild plot 2 saline alkali cotton fields of the kada from may 2010 to september 2010 during the main cotton growing seasons fig 1 the plots can be divided by soil salt content within 30 cm below the land surface 6 12 g kg for plot 1 and 2 5 6 g kg for plot 2 according to previous studies wang et al 2011 sun et al 2012 seeds of the cotton hybrid xinluzhong no 26 were sown on may 7 2010 there are 120 days from sowing to harvesting and the plant heights usually ranged from 1 to 2 m wang 2012 more than 95 of the cotton roots are distributed within 60 cm below the surface in northern xinjiang li et al 1999 the cotton growing season in the kada can be divided into the seedling late april to late may budding early june to early july flowering middle july to middle august boll late august to middle september batting late september to middle october and harvest middle october to late november periods wang et al 2011 3 1 experimental design the drip irrigation system consisted of a plastic tank 1000 l 1 m above ground and 15 drip tubes drip tubes with emitters spaced 0 2 m apart were established at the center of each planting bed the discharge rate of the emitter was 0 4 0 6 l h at plot 1 and 2 7 l h at plot 2 respectively the amount of water applied in the first irrigation was 39 2 mm on the day of sowing for leaching salt and raising soil water content swc after sowing irrigation periods were from may 19 to august 26 for plot 1 and from may 25 to august 26 for plot 2 soil water potential swp was observed by tensiometers the depths of observation were 20 cm below the emitters to control irrigation to maintain the smp above 10 kpa at plot 1 and 20 kpa for plot 2 due to the solute potential in saline alkali soils a higher level of smp control is often needed to maintain the required swp jiao et al 2007 the tensiometers were measured three times per day at 8 00 12 00 18 00 during the cotton growing season when the smp at 20 cm decreased below the target values the irrigation water amount could be conducted immediately and the irrigation quota was 9 8 mm for each time the irrigation quota was determined by the plastic tank volume divided by the corresponding irrigation area before the irrigation experiments the initial water table depths were approximately 2 9 m for plot 1 and 3 8 m for plot 2 respectively a diagram of the field experiment design is presented in fig 2 ridge tillage with plastic mulching was applied at plot 1 to increase water table depth and decrease phreatic water evaporation which is beneficial for controlling soil secondary salinization in severe saline alkali soils jiao et al 2007 dou et al 2011 tan et al 2013 the different geometrics of the plant spacing and irrigation spatial pattern at two plots were obtained by repeating the methods outlined in wang et al 2012 the geometric characteristics of the planting and row spacing are set up to achieve certain croppingdensity and yield at the two sites the distance between the drip irrigation tubes is determined to guarantee that each position can be irrigated based on the given discharge rate the ridge was 0 4 m wide and 0 15 m high the distance between the emitters of adjacent drip irrigation belts was 0 8 m fig 2a cotton was planted and plastic mulching was applied in a flat field of plot 2 the distance between emitters of different drip tubes was 1 4 m fig 2b the distance between the drip irrigation tubes is established so that each position can be irrigated based on the given discharge rate generally plastic mulching with a width of 0 8 m covered 2 rows and the cotton crops were planted in 20 cm row spacings plastic mulching with a width of 1 4 m covered four rows and the cotton crops were planted in row spaces 20 40 20 cm each drip irrigation tube was 3 8 m long and 10 cm wide there were 10 and 5 drip irrigation tubes at plot 1 and plot 2 respectively the cotton planting spacing was 0 1 m thus cropping density for both plots was approximately 25 plants m2 to achieve high yield deng et al 2011 3 2 field monitoring and sampling precipitation temperature humidity wind speed wind direction and solar net radiation were observed using davis automatic weather station data were recorded every 15 min except for the tensiometers applied at 20 cm below the emitters for smp control there were corresponding tensiometers and a soil water sampling collector established at different depths below the land surface 100 120 150 180 220 and 260 cm at plot 1 and 120 150 180 210 250 300 and 350 cm at plot 2 and different horizontal distances 0 20 and 40 cm away from the drip tube for plot 1 and 0 35 and 70 cm away from the drip tube for plot 2 fig 2 daily smp data were observed manually at 8 00 a m from may 19 to september 21 for plot 1 and from may 25 to september 23 for plot 2 the depth of the groundwater table was monitored daily at two seepage pits adjacent to the plots at 8 00 a m from may 20 to september 22 for plot 1 and from may 31 to september 22 for plot 2 rainwater samples were collected after the occurrence of each precipitation event from july 27 to september 13 for plot 1 and from july 10 to september 13 for plot 2 irrigation water was sampled from july 19 to august 26 for plot 1 and from july 18 to september 10 for plot 2 soil water samples were collected at the depths shown in fig 2 from may 28 to september 6 in plot 1 and from may 28 to august 20 in plot 2 using a manual vacuum pump during high swc soil samples were vertically collected at an interval of 10 cm for analyzing swc from august 4 to september 18 in plot 1 and from may 3 to september 18 in plot 2 soil samples collected at an interval of 20 cm from the 0 260 cm depth for plot 1 and the 0 350 cm depth for plot 2 were measured for particle analysis using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern uk in the laboratory according to the international soil texture class standard we determined the soil textures for the soil profile of each plot tables 1 and 2 water samples including rainwater irrigation water and soil water were collected in clean 25 ml or 100 ml polyethylene bottles tightly capped and stored at 4 c until analysis all of the samples were sent to the center laboratory for physical and chemical analysis institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research igsnrr chinese academy of sciences cas as soon as possible 3 3 laboratory experiment 3 3 1 soil water content measurement the soil samples collected in aluminum jars 55 35 mm were dried in oven to constant weight under 105 110 c overnight and cooled in a desiccator to avoid reabsorbing water from the atmosphere the swc can be determined by weighing the samples before and after extracting water and dividing the dry soil weight using the following equation 1 θ g w wet w dry w dry 100 2 θ v θ g γ where θ g θ v w wet w dry and γ refer to swc g g soil volumetric water content cm3 cm3 wet soil weight g dry soil g and dry soil bulk density g cm3 respectively soil volumetric water content was used in this study 3 3 2 analysis of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h of the water samples were measured using an isotopic water analyzer picarro l2120 i at the environmental isotope laboratory of igsnrr cas results were expressed as the parts per thousand deviations from the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow the analytical precision is 0 1 for δ18o and 1 for δ2h respectively 3 4 calculation methods swp is calculated by smp plus gravity potential the zero points for gravity potential are defined at the ground surface for both plots the water amount of evapotranspiration and transformation from soil water and groundwater can be calculated according to the zero flux plane method if the stable convergent zero flux plane czfp exists during the experimental period evapotranspiration can be estimated from water balance calculation of the unsaturated zone above the czfp and the transformed water amount between the soil water and groundwater can be obtained from the water balance calculation of soil layers below the czfp 4 results 4 1 soil water potential 4 2 1 plot 1 fig 3 shows the swp dynamics and variations of water table depth under the irrigation precipitation infiltration at plot 1 the swp at 100 120 and 150 cm increased with time during the cotton seedling budding and flowering periods during the cotton boll period the swp at these depths decreased with time the swp at 100 120 and 150 cm ranged from 291 2 to 138 8 cm the swp gradients at plot 1 during the observation are shown in table s1 supplementary the swp gradients were negative at 100 120 and 120 150 cm and almost positive at 150 180 180 220 and 220 260 cm during the seedling budding and flowering periods the groundwater table depth decreased and the swp at 180 220 and 260 cm slowly increased with time during the cotton boll period the groundwater table depth remained relatively stable at approximately 230 cm below the ground surface and the swps decreased with time the swp at 180 220 and 260 cm ranged from 296 3 to 171 6 cm during the observation period 4 2 2 plot 2 fig 4 shows the swp dynamics and the groundwater table depth changes during the observation at plot 2 during the cotton seedling and budding periods with irrigation the swp maintains an oscillation balance with time at different depths and the groundwater table slowly increases during the flowering and boll periods near the end of the irrigation event the swp at 120 cm decreases with time the swp at 120 cm ranges from 541 9 to 109 0 cm the swp gradients in plot 2 during observation are shown in table s2 the soil water displayed a downward trend of movement with the mostly negative swp gradients at the 150 180 cm and 210 250 cm depth ranges and an upward trend with the mostly positive swp gradients at the 120 150 cm and 180 210 cm depth ranges the swp increased with time at the czfp approximately 180 cm and decreased with time at divergent zero flux planes 150 and 210 cm depths the swps at 150 180 and 210 cm ranged from 481 5 to 49 71 cm and remained relatively stable the positive swp gradients at 250 300 cm close to the groundwater capillary zone show an upward movement of soil water because it approaches the capillary zone the swp gradients below 300 cm are close to 0 with decreasing water table depth during the seedling budding and flowering periods the swps at 250 300 and 350 cm increased with time due to groundwater capillary rise during the boll period the water table depth decreased to approximately 330 cm below the ground surface and remained relatively stable the swps at 250 300 and 350 cm varied between 514 2 m and 42 1 cm 4 2 soil water content swc is an important factor affecting plant growth and it is also a key parameter for assessing the water balance in arid regions from field experiments we obtained the soil water content data from both plots plot 1 fig 5 shows the variations of swc with soil texture profile the swc at 0 60 cm ranges from 0 2 to 0 45 with depth with clear increasing trend during the irrigation period august 4 and august 18 and a decreasing trend during the non irrigation period september 11 and september 18 the swc at 50 60 cm decreased to approximately 0 3 the swc increased in the silt layer from approximately 0 3 to 0 45 at 60 120 cm it decreased from approximately 0 45 to 0 2 at 120 150 cm for the loamy sand and sandy loamy layers swc at 150 260 cm increased from approximately 0 2 to 0 45 with depth 4 2 1 plot 2 fig 6 shows the vertical distribution of swc with the soil texture profile the swc at 0 120 cm ranges from approximately 0 1 to 0 4 with depth with an increasing trend during the irrigation period august 3 and decreasing trend during the non irrigation period september 11 and september 18 a distinct decrease of the swc can be observed at a range of 0 1 0 2 at 40 50 cm the swc at 120 160 cm decreased sharply from 0 4 to approximately 0 2 the swc increased from approximately 0 2 to 0 35 at 150 220 cm for the silt layer and decreased from approximately 0 35 to 0 05 at 220 250 cm for the loamy sand layer the swc at 250 350 cm increased from 0 05 to 0 4 4 3 isotopic compositions in water the stable isotopic profiles of soil water can be controlled by climate conditions soil texture the evapotranspiration process antecedent moisture precipitation and irrigation events and vegetation cover figs 7 and 8 show the δ18o δ2h in the soil profile and the variations of δ2h in soil water samples with depth for plot 1 and plot 2 respectively the general statistics of isotopic compositions in water samples across all of the sampling time are shown in table 3 the precipitation and irrigation waters have similar isotopic features during the monitoring period for both plots precipitation in plot 1 ranged from 4 8 to 1 0 mean 3 6 for δ18o and from 44 to 18 mean 30 for δ2h respectively at plot 2 precipitation water was characterized by δ18o ranging from 5 7 to 1 0 mean 3 3 and δ2h ranging from 51 to 9 mean 30 respectively irrigation water was characterized by δ18o ranging from 15 2 to 14 1 mean 14 9 and δ2h ranging from 113 to 106 mean 110 respectively the local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 7 21δ18o 4 50 was referenced from a previous study li et al 2009 the isotopic compositions of precipitation irrigation water and most soil water samples are located below the lmwl irrigation water is obviously more depleted in the isotopic compositions than that in precipitation we assumed a minor change in the isotopic compositions of groundwater during the experimental period the isotopic compositions of groundwater samples collected from two monitoring wells t8 near plot 1 and t20 near plot 2 han et al 2011 can be used as the isotopic compositions of groundwater for plot 1 and plot 2 respectively they are very different from each other as shown in table 3 at plot 1 the soil water samples ranged from 15 3 to 6 0 mean 10 0 for δ18o and from 102 to 65 mean 83 for δ2h respectively the isotopic compositions of the soil water at 100 cm are more enriched relative to the irrigation water the points of soil waters at 120 and 150 cm on fig 7 are close to the irrigation water quite different from the soil water at 100 cm at 180 220 and 260 cm the points of the soil water samples are gradually approaching that of groundwater regarding the isotopic compositions of the soil water samples at plot 2 they ranged from 10 5 to 4 3 mean 6 9 for δ18o and from 78 to 57 mean 66 for δ2h respectively the isotopic compositions of soil water at 120 cm were closer to that of irrigation water compared to that at other depths the soil water samples collected from 180 210 250 300 and 350 cm are characterized by the enrichment of isotopic compositions relative to the irrigation water and soil water at 120 cm 5 discussion 5 1 impact of infiltration evapotranspiration on soil water the soil water at 0 150 cm for both plots is influenced by the irrigation precipitation infiltration and evapotranspiration showing that the swps and swcs increase during the irrigation period and decrease during the non irrigation period figs 3 6 the source of plant water is mainly from the deep rooted zone during the dry season and from shallow sources during the wet season dawson and pate 1996 wang et al 2017 owing to the deep root water uptake the swps at 100 120 and 150 cm at plot 1 decrease with time during the boll period and the swps at 120 cm at plot 2 decrease with time during the flowering and boll periods figs 3 and 4 the results indicate that some of the cotton root system has reached these depths during the flowering and boll periods due to the increased water consumption during these stages which is also proved by related research in north xinjiang li et al 2017 the swcs at 0 150 cm for both plots increased with depth figs 5 and 6 indicating that evapotranspiration decreases with depth similarly the variations in the isotopic compositions of soil water at 0 150 cm for both plots decreased with depth table 3 figs 7 and 8 due to the surface layers having been impacted by infiltration and evapotranspiration more than the deeper layers hsieh et al 1998 wan and liu 2016 change in the swcs at 0 60 cm with depth during irrigation and non irrigation periods for both plots is greater than at other depths this indicates that 0 60 cm is the main interval containing the root zone for cotton fields under mulched drip irrigation in north xinjiang li et al 1999 which may be influenced by irrigation precipitation infiltration and evapotranspiration including direct evaporation to a greater extent compared with below the strong root water uptake may result in the observed decrease of the swcs at depths of 40 60 cm for both plots figs 5 and 6 guo et al 2005 the swc mainly controlled by the soil texture at 60 150 cm for both plots decreased sharply at approximately 120 140 cm for plot 1 and 140 160 cm for plot 2 figs 5 and 6 with changes in the soil textures at different depths tables 1 and 2 the irrigation water under mulching drip mode can infiltrate and accumulate within a certain depth range from the ground surface resulting in a clear decline of the swc at these depths therefore it can be identified that infiltration depths are approximately 150 cm for both plots with 0 60 cm the main infiltration depths these results are consistent with a previous study by qiao and wang 2014 which reported that the depth affected by evapotranspiration is 0 120 cm in an inland arid basin in northwest china continued irrigation infiltration can lead to the formation of a desalination zone within 0 40 cm and irrigation drainage below 80 cm depth is less than 10 6 mm at plot 1 wang et al 2011 wang 2012 5 2 mechanisms of soil water movement as mentioned above infiltration depth of 150 cm has been identified for both plots the isotopic compositions of soil water at 100 cm for plot 1 were more enriched compared with that of 120 and 150 cm fig 7 this enrichment trend may occur as a result of several processes the effect of soil water evaporation on the isotopic composition and occurrence of more enriched isotopic compositions in soil water at 100 cm for plot 1 compared with that at 120 and 150 cm depths fig 7 it can be resulted from the evaporation near the ground surface in arid area zimmermann et al 1967 the soil water at 120 and 150 cm was less affected by evapotranspiration compared with 100 cm due to silty soil being an obstacle fig 5 additionally the soil water can be affected by the mixing processes between new water input i e precipitation and irrigation water and old water i e antecedent moisture within the unsaturated zone gazis and feng 2004 similarly because the soil water at 120 cm for plot 2 was more affected by the infiltration of irrigation drainage the isotopic compositions were closer to that of the irrigation water compared with other depths at plot 2 fig 8 the isotopic compositions of soil water at 100 cm for plot 1 were closer to that of the soil water at 120 cm for plot 2 table 3 which may indicate a similar degree of evaporation and mixing process mentioned above if only piston flow exists at plot 1 the soil water at these depths may be less influenced by irrigation precipitation infiltration and the isotopic compositions at 120 and 150 cm might approach the antecedent water with enriched isotopic composition however the isotopic compositions are actually close to that of the irrigation water albeit with highly scattered ranges this indicates that the soil water at these depths for plot 1 may also be recharged by the infiltration of irrigation water through preferential flow since some of the cotton root system reached these depths during the flowering and boll periods the macropores developed in the unsaturated zone can lead to preferential flow in the root zone beven and germann 1982 gehrels et al 1998 preferential flow is commonplace in soils whose moisture is substantially less than saturated soil and may be greater in drier media padilla et al 1999 nimmo 2016 the macropores could be caused by the soil heterogeneity kung 1990 such as the sandy loam soil distributed at the depth range of 120 150 cm additionally the scattered isotope data at 120 and 150 cm indicate that the water source may have come from a wide variety of recharge sources song et al 2009 since the soil water at 150 250 cm for plot 2 is rarely affected by irrigation precipitation infiltration evapotranspiration or capillary upflow from groundwater the swp and swc at these depths have relatively minor changes with time figs 4 and 6 the isotopic compositions of the soil water samples collected from 180 210 and 250 cm depths at plot 2 are more enriched relative to that of the irrigation water fig 8 which suggests that the old soil water may be subjected to strong evaporation in arid regions prior to irrigation zimmermann et al 1967 and be moved into these depths from upper soil layers kortelainen and karhu 2004 the soil water at 150 260 cm for plot 1 and 250 350 cm for plot 2 is affected by the groundwater capillary rise with positive swp gradients figs 3 and 4 tables s1 and s2 the swcs at these sections are characterized by high values during the observation period figs 5 and 6 with the relatively stable swps response to variations in groundwater table depth figs 3 and 4 suggesting the approaching saturation in these sections the isotopic compositions of soil water at 180 220 and 260 cm for plot 1 and 300 and 350 cm for plot 2 gradually approach that of groundwater with depth figs 7 and 8 the enriched signals of the isotopic compositions in the deeper soil water often show the evaporation prior to infiltration or the mixture of groundwater through capillary rise komor and emerson 1994 nativ et al 1995 the swcs below 220 cm for plot 1 and below 330 cm for plot 2 are close to the saturated soil water content approximately 0 42 for plot 1 and 0 4 for plot 2 respectively figs 5 and 6 the swp gradients at theses depths are close to 0 indicating these sections below 220 cm for plot 1 and 330 cm for plot 2 are within the capillary saturated zones it is remarkable that there is no obvious vertical oscillation of the isotopic compositions in soil water at plot 2 relative to that of plot 1 under the heterogeneous soil conditions figs 7 and 8 based on the swp gradients at 120 250 cm in plot 2 table s2 the soil water migrates downward at 150 180 cm and 210 250 cm depths and upward at 120 150 cm and 180 210 cm depths i e variable directions possibly caused by strong texture stratification table 2 song et al 2009 indicating that the soil water at different sections of 150 250 cm can be mixed to some extent it may result in the stable distribution of isotopic compositions with depths at 150 250 cm in plot 2 the soil at 250 350 cm is characterized by greater swp gradient compared with plot 1 tables s1 and s2 and thus may be more susceptible to groundwater through capillary rise resulting in the stable distribution of isotopic compositions at 250 350 cm at plot 2 the isotopic compositions of groundwater at both plots are quite distinct from each other table 3 figs 7 and 8 the variability of the regional hydrogeological conditions described by han et al 2011 can explain these differences as being caused by mixing with the antecedent water near the water level fluctuation zone at the two plots with different water table depths groundwater at both plots is recharged by the lateral groundwater flow from different directions supplementary fig s1 which may result in the variational isotopic compositions han et al 2011 5 3 conceptual model of the soil water movement the soil water flow systems under the current irrigation mode in both plots in the kada can be summarized in fig 9 the vertical movement of soil water in the unsaturated zone can be divided into three layers i the surface layer 0 150 cm for both plots which has an obvious response to the irrigation precipitation infiltration and evapotranspiration ii middle layer 150 250 cm for plot 2 which is rarely affected by irrigation precipitation infiltration or groundwater capillary rise and iii deep layer below 150 cm for plot 1 and below 250 cm for plot 2 which is susceptible to the rising capillary water as described above the infiltration depths are 0 150 cm for both plots under the mulched drip irrigation the soil water migration can lower salt accumulation in the root zone within 60 cm depth which is beneficial for cotton growth in the kada the results of the previous field experiments conducted by wang et al 2014 and chen et al 2016 show that the soil salinity of the soil profile 0 120 cm increases with increasing sampling depth it was also observed by wang et al 2011 that under the continued drip irrigation implemented during 2008 2010 the soil salinity can be washed by the soil water migration leading to a clear desalination zone within the 0 40 cm in plot 1 the depth range of 0 40 cm is the main root zone of cotton under mulched drip irrigation wang 2012 in addition the infiltration depths 0 150 cm at both plots indicate that irrigation water is unlikely to recharge into groundwater however the rise in the water table can lead to a corresponding rise in the height of the capillary water zone which can even reach the main root zone northey et al 2006 consequently hydrological processes such as precipitation irrigation drainage evapotranspiration capillary upflow from groundwater fertilizer dissolution and salt pollutants input at the surface layer can easily affect the soil water system through the relatively thinner unsaturated zone during the irrigation period water reallocation may result in the deterioration of dryland salinity and reduce the crop yield bouksila et al 2013 the soil water movement at the middle layer of plot 2 has rarely responded to the infiltration of precipitation irrigation drainage or groundwater capillary rise the swc swp and isotopic compositions of soil water in the middle layer have minor changes with time compared with the surface and deep layers figs 4 6 and 8 the middle layer can be regarded as a steady state hydrologic layer which has been defined and recognized by many previous studies of china s loess plateau wan and liu 2016 tan et al 2017a b although the middle layer of plot 2 cannot stop the downward movement of water and salt from the root zone it extends the distance between the root zone and the groundwater table therefore plot 2 may be less prone to secondary salinization compared with plot 1 5 4 estimation of soil water storage change in the unsaturated zone soil water storage sws is a critical parameter for determining vertical water and energy fluxes in hydrological processes which are associated with precipitation irrigation surface runoff groundwater and plant growth brocca et al 2009 heathman et al 2012 penna et al 2013 li et al 2015 it is also an important aspect for assessing water use efficiency for agricultural water management in this study the flowering and boll periods i e the critical growth periods for cotton can be selected for estimating the sws during the critical cotton growing periods for plot 1 the calculation intervals include the late flowering period august 4 to august 18 the early and middle boll period august 18 to september 11 and the late boll period september 11 to september 18 for plot 2 the calculation intervals range from the late flowering period to the late boll period august 3 to september 11 september 11 to september 18 the soil column per unit area below the drip irrigation belt can be taken as a system for estimating soil water storage change fig 10 the top interfaces of the soil columns are the ground surface for both plots the bottom interfaces of the columns namely the top interfaces of capillary saturation zones are located at 220 cm and 330 cm below the ground surface for plot 1 and plot 2 respectively the water in the calculating systems is originated from precipitation p irrigation i and the water transfer amount d between the unsaturated and saturated zone if the d is positive groundwater though the capillary water rise will recharge the soil water system on the contrary if d is negative the soil water can reach the water table and recharge the aquifer the discharges of the column system mainly include evapotranspiration et which refers to the evaporation es from the unsaturated zone and transpiration ep from the cotton field the variations of water input and output in the columns result in the soil water storage change swsc δ w which can be expressed by the following eqs 3 and 4 precipitation p and irrigation i can be obtained by practical observation 3 δ w p i d et 4 δ w δ w s δ w m δ w d where δ w s δ w m and δ w d δ w m and δ w d refer to the swsc at the surface middle and deep layers respectively the swsc of each layer can be estimated by summing up soil water storage change of each sub layer eqs 57 5 δ ws δ θ s ts 6 δ wm δ θ m tm 7 δ wd δ θ d td where δ θ s δ θ m and δ θ d correspond to the swsc in the surface middle and deep layers respectively and ts tm and td refer to the corresponding thickness of each layer the vertical variations of the swp during the calculation periods are shown in fig s2 for plot 1 and fig s3 for plot 2 respectively there are stable czfps 150 cm for plot 1 and 250 cm for plot 2 respectively which are also the interfaces located between the middle and deep layers during the calculation periods indicating that the soil water above the interfaces cannot be affected by groundwater capillary rise while the soil water below the interfaces cannot respond to the irrigation precipitation infiltration the percolation of the irrigation drainage cannot reach the groundwater table during the calculation periods et can be estimated by eq 8 according to water balance of the surface and middle layers for both plots 8 et p i δ w s δ w m because the directions of soil water movement at 150 220 cm are variable with depth and time the water transfer amount d between the soil water and groundwater at plot 1 can be calculated by eqs 9 and 10 the water transfer flux d 180 at the interface 180 cm depth is equal to the calculated soil water storage change δ w 150 180 at 150 180 cm eq 9 the water transfer flux d 220 at the interface between soil water and groundwater can be obtained from eq 10 based on calculating swsc at 180 220 cm δ w 180 220 and d 180 at the interface of the 180 cm depth 9 d 180 δ w 150 180 10 d 220 d 180 δ w 180 220 whereas the soil water at 250 330 cm driven by the capillary water rise migrates upward with time and depth the water transfer amount d between the soil water and groundwater at plot 2 can be expressed by eq 11 11 d δ w d the calculated results for the swsc and water balance components of the unsaturated zone at plot 1 are shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively the sws within 0 150 cm decreases from august 4 to august 18 at the late flowering period and august 18 to september 11 at the early and middle boll periods due to the excess of evapotranspiration relative to the irrigation precipitation amount the sws increases again from september 11 to september 18 at the late boll period probably resulting from the lateral soil water input during the non irrigation period the swsc at 150 180 cm varies from 1 7 mm to 21 7 mm and then to 3 2 mm during three calculating periods respectively the increasing sws within 150 180 cm during the first two stages may be caused by the upward movement of soil water from the interface of 180 cm depth to the soil water in the upper layer at 150 180 cm fig s2 the swsc at 180 220 cm during the calculating periods changes from 6 0 mm to 33 7 mm and then to 3 9 mm respectively the increasing sws within 180 220 cm may result from the bidirectional soil water confluence including the downward movement of the soil water at the interface of the 180 cm depth and the upward movement of the soil water from the 220 cm depth fig s2 during the three periods table 5 the water transfer amount between the soil water and groundwater at plot 1 varies from 7 7 mm to 55 4 mm and then to 7 1 mm with the water table depth ranges which change from 2 5 to 2 42 m 2 42 2 3 m to 2 3 2 35 m respectively it suggests that groundwater through capillary water rise recharges into the upper soil water system following the increasing groundwater table the groundwater amount migrated into the soil water system accounts for 6 5 47 8 and then to 65 1 of total water inputs in the unsaturated zone during the three periods with an increasing trend the contribution of irrigation water changes from 83 3 to 50 8 and then to 0 of total water inputs of the unsaturated zone at three periods showing an obvious decreasing trend the results showing the swsc and the water balance components of the unsaturated zone at plot 2 are shown in tables 6 and 7 respectively the sws within 0 150 cm table 6 decreases during the two periods due to evapotranspiration exceeding the irrigation precipitation infiltration the increasing sws within 150 250 cm during the first period august 3 to september 11 may be caused by the lateral soil water flow and then it decreases during the second stage i e the late boll period probably resulting from the deep root water uptake the upward movement of soil water from the 330 cm depth may result in the increasing sws at 250 330 cm during both periods fig s3 the positive amount of water transfer between soil water and groundwater indicates the occurrence of groundwater entering the vadose zone through capillary water movement it can be seen from table 7 that the contribution of groundwater can account for 6 5 and 74 2 of total water inputs in the unsaturated zone during the two periods while the irrigation water occupies 73 6 and 0 of total water inputs in the unsaturated zone in summary the infiltration of irrigation drainage has a minimal effect on groundwater for both plots however groundwater can enter into the unsaturated zone through the rising capillary water during the calculating periods combined with the swp dynamics during the observation period figs 3 and 4 tables s1 and s2 the stable czfps can be identified at 150 cm for plot 1 and at 250 cm for plot 2 respectively the results suggest that the current mulching drip irrigation can restrain the infiltration capacity into the groundwater system and effectively impede the groundwater table rise which can prevent the secondary salinization of soil in the kada 5 5 recharge source of the shallow groundwater due to the scarce precipitation and lack of surface runoff in this desert area the main sources of soil water originates from irrigation drainage and groundwater as already mentioned the infiltration depth range was approximately 0 150 cm for both plots indicating that under the mulching drip irrigation mode the infiltration of precipitation irrigation rarely changed the soil water flow pattern below 150 cm depth in the unsaturated zone and cannot be attributed to groundwater recharge it is also consistent with the fact that irrigation precipitation water amounts of less than 15 mm is unlikely to recharge into groundwater in the inland arid areas of northwestern china due to the high potential evaporation wei 1988 however the water table rose during the observation period approximately 60 cm for plot 1 and 50 cm for plot 2 fig 3a and fig 4a respectively in the kada the drip irrigation mode has been applied for cotton planting since 2006 while for the woodlands located at the eastern part of the kada and trees on both sides of the road in this region fig 1 and fig s4 flooding irrigation was employed chen et al 2016 the woodlands are approximately 3 9 and 1 3 km away from plot 1 and plot 2 fig 1 and fig s4 respectively combined with the analysis of water table contours in 2009 by a previous study fig s1 han et al 2011 it can be reasonably concluded that the groundwater underlying the cotton fields may be recharged by the lateral groundwater flow which is likely derived from the infiltration of flood irrigation from the adjacent woodlands or trees on the roadside before the exploitation of land in the kada in september 1997 the groundwater flow direction was towards the northeast fig s1 the hydraulic gradient of shallow groundwater changed from 3 1 in the upstream area to approximately 0 5 in the eastern part han et al 2011 the water table depth ranged from 10 m in the upstream to 18 m in the downstream the prevailing groundwater flow direction changed from the ne direction in september 1997 to the sw direction in october 2009 in comparison with the groundwater flow field in 1997 an obvious high water table area occurred in the eastern part in 2009 the hydraulic gradient of shallow groundwater in the cotton area varied from 0 5 to 2 in the low water table area to 0 8 2 3 in the high water table area the prevailing hydraulic gradient in october 2009 fig s1 was approximately 1 6 for plot 1 and 2 0 for plot 2 respectively the unconfined aquifers at both plots are composed of gravel silt and fine sand with a hydraulic conductivity of 0 4 0 9 m d and specific yield 0 08 0 10 cui et al 1997 the horizontal darcy s velocity of groundwater was calculated as 6 4 10 4 to 1 4 10 3 m d for plot 1 and 8 10 4 to 1 8 10 3 m d for plot 2 respectively during the observation period in 2010 the observed rise rates of the water table are approximately 4 8 mm d at plot 1 and 4 3 mm d at plot 2 and the corresponding groundwater recharge is 4 8 10 4 m d for plot 1 and 4 3 10 4 m d for plot 2 the horizontal darcy s velocity of groundwater is close to or more than the regional groundwater recharge rate it can be speculated that the lateral groundwater inflow is indeed responsible for the groundwater table rise on this basis 6 summary and environmental implications in order to investigate the mechanism of soil water movement in the unsaturated zone and the impact of irrigation precipitation infiltration on groundwater recharge under the mulched drip irrigation in an arid region we conducted the field experiments in severe saline alkali plot 1 and mild saline alkali plot 2 cotton fields in the kada during the cotton growing season combining physical based techniques in conjunction with stable isotope tracers δ18o and δ2h in the field experiment settings we described the mechanisms of soil water movement in the two cotton fields investigated whether the drip irrigation in the cotton fields has contributed to the observed groundwater table rise and propose a conceptual model of the soil water flow system the infiltration depths are approximately 150 cm for both plots the capillary upflow from groundwater can migrate into the unsaturated zone during the flowering and boll periods however the current mulching drip irrigation mode in the cotton fields may be not responsible for the groundwater table rise which was found to rise approximately 60 cm for plot 1 and 50 cm for plot 2 during the observation period it may have resulted from the lateral groundwater inflow driven by the flood irrigation from the adjacent woodlands rather than the vertical infiltration of irrigation drainage the current drip irrigation mode in the cotton fields can be conductive to salt leaching out of the main root zone i e within the 60 cm depth below ground surface and can effectively mitigate the degree of soil salinization in this area plot 2 was less prone to secondary salinization in comparison with plot 1 due to the middle layer extending the distance between the root zone and groundwater the mulching drip irrigation can be considered a suitable technique in other similar arid regions it is imperative to control the water table rise in order to optimize the management of agricultural water resources and improve the ecological environment in this arid region based on our analysis of the field monitoring data previous investigations on the regional scale and lessons drawn from australian agricultural dryland we offer the following recommendations i to obtain a full understanding of the current environmental implications the optimum water saving irrigation schedule can be continually explored to achieve the goal of increasing the cotton yield ii to establish drainage systems e g pumping groundwater deep open drains in this area that can effectively control dryland salinity and shallow water tables in the arid region especially the cotton fields in xinjiang liu et al 2014 iii a water treatment plant can be built in this area for treating and reclaiming the local salinized groundwater to be reused for agricultural irrigation or domestic and industrial purposes leading to an improvement of the recycling rate of water resources and iv given that the shallow water tables and high salinity groundwater the local farmers may consider the option of various salt tolerant plants e g salt bush and lucerne pavelic et al 1997 cotton and barley ranatunga et al 2010 and atriplex aucheri and suaeda salsa zhao et al 2013b additionally tree plantation on seepage areas may be a useful method for increasing the groundwater discharge rate and reducing the local salinity due to the high transpiration rates observed in trees planted over shallow water tables in arid regions george et al 1999 stirzaker et al 1999 cramer et al 1999 different types of trees can be properly planted around the cotton field according to the soil salinity supplementary table s3 wei and ge 2001 however over planting of trees in arid zones will decrease the groundwater recharge and cause a rapid drop in water table levels which may result in the death of planted trees yin et al 2015 establishment of deep rooted pastures can not only reduce evaporation and the groundwater recharge rate but also control the dryland salinity pavelic et al 1997 generally human activities can change the hydrological cycle and strengthen spatiotemporal reallocation of water resources in arid regions it is vital to understand the mechanism of soil water movement in unsaturated zones and its impact on groundwater recharge for sustainable water utilization and maintenance of a healthy ecosystem in arid regions lessons for solving the dryland salinity problems that the kada might draw from the australian and israeli experience should be highlighted when developing agricultural irrigation in like climatic

7367,climate variability and anthropogenic regulations are two interwoven factors in the ecohydrologic system across large basins understanding the roles that these two factors play under various hydrologic conditions is of great significance for basin hydrology and sustainable water utilization in this study we present an analytical approach based on coupling water balance method and budyko hypothesis to derive effectiveness coefficients ecs of climate change as a way to disentangle contributions of it and human activities to the variability of river discharges under different hydro transitional situations the climate dominated streamflow change δ q c by ec approach was compared with those deduced by the elasticity method and sensitivity index the results suggest that the ec approach is valid and applicable for hydrologic study at large basin scale analyses of various scenarios revealed that contributions of climate change and human activities to river discharge variation differed among the regions of the study area over the past several decades climate change dominated hydro transitions from dry to wet while human activities played key roles in the reduction of streamflow during wet to dry periods remarkable decline of discharge in upstream was mainly due to human interventions although climate contributed more to runoff increasing during dry periods in the semi arid downstream induced effectiveness on streamflow changes indicated a contribution ratio of 49 for climate and 51 for human activities at the basin scale from 1956 to 2015 the mathematic derivation based simple approach together with the case example of temporal segmentation and spatial zoning could help people understand variation of river discharge with more details at a large basin

garrote et al 2016 henriques et al 2015 pires et al 2017 as a consequence river discharge of many basins departed significantly from their natural variability without a holistic understanding of basin hydrology particularly the river discharge variability and its causes the risk in water security is likely to be high basin hydrology consists of processes in the atmosphere down to the land surface

hydrologic events such as river discharges are often a result of complex interactions between climate change and anthropogenic activities silveira et al 2017 this complexity represents a challenge to separate contributions from climate change to observed streamflow variation ye et al 2013 studies on this complexity could help better understand how and why streamflow varies and informed management decision to adapt future water stresses khalil et al 2005 especially in water scarce regions for a natural system climate plays an important role in transitions between wet normal and dry conditions corresponding to high normal and low flows in river discharge goler et al 2016 shabalova et al 2003 human activities exert additional fluctuations to strengthen or weaken the natural variations guo et al 2015 at a basin level intensity of human impacts is tightly linked to changes of underlying condition and actual evapotranspiration aet which is primarily controlled by regional water energy patterns moyano et al 2015 senay et al 2011 as strengthened human regulations changed land surface more and more basin hydrology appears with higher complexity physically quantifying major hydrologic variables like aet or river discharge with their variations faces challenges coupling classic methods of climatology and water balance is of reliable feasibility to comprehensively disentangle contributions to river discharge variations due to climate change and human activities qiu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 methodologically therefore separation of human influences from climate impacts on river streamflow can be categorized into two types one is based on water balance where separation of the two can be made through determination of aet the other is based on water energy shifts which reflect some general insights of streamflow variations bosshard et al 2013 it is obvious that the first approach aims at quantitative separation while the latter features particular emphasis on

real outputs of aet underlying conditions are considered i e zhang et al 2001 wang and hejazi 2011 the introduced parameters often varied with climate vegetation and soils and thus are difficult to quantify the variability and difficulty of determining these parameters often introduce some uncertainties for separation of human and climate impacts on river streamflow jiang et al 2015 ye et al 2013 zeng et al 2015 in this study we presented an analytical approach based on partial derivatives under the framework of coupling basin water balance and the budyko hypothesis which made determination of climatic influences on river discharge variation more simply and mathematically understanding furthermore various scenarios settings for different hydro transitions in diverse regions for contribution decomposition were conducted ideas of temporal segmentation and spatial zoning could help contribution separation working with more details which would help people understand variation of river discharge and then manage the basin resources better under dual impacts of climate change and human activities findings could be a case example for comprehensive studies on basin hydrology in the perspective of complicated ecohydrologic variations in time and space 2 study area and data the tao river basin trb is the second largest tributary of the upper yellow river in northwestern china geographically located between 101 36 e and 104 20 e 34 06 n and 36 01 with a total area of 25 527 km2 and a multi yearly average annual total of 46 13 108 m3 in discharge 1956 2015 the basin features an elevation range from 1730 4560 m covers portions of the eastern tibetan plateau 4560 2800 m and southwestern loess plateau 2800 1730 m from upstream to downstream annual mean air temperature increased from lower than 2 c to over 8 c from the west part of the basin to the east while precipitation decreased from over 600 mm in the west to about 350 mm in the northeast high complexity of ecohydrology was found across the whole basin fig 1 according to the remarkable heterogeneity of hydrometeorology and land cover in space we divide the whole basin into upper middle and lower areas along with considering the industrial mode across the trb it features a relatively flat topography with open valleys and dominates grasslands in the upper reaches while the meandering river is surrounded by high mountains covered mainly by forests and grasses in the middle reaches the river flows into loess plateau in the lower reaches where vegetation with low coverage occupied about 21 resulted in relatively severe water and soil loss the industrial modes transit from grazing dominated in the upper area to the rain fed agriculture dominated in the lower area while in the middle area it features a mixture of forestry grazing and farming we collected hydrometeorological series in or near the trb from china meteorological data sharing network http data cma cn and gansu province bureau of hydrology and water resources monitoring including 10 standard weather stations 22 rainfall gauge stations and 6 hydrological observational stations 5 on main stream and 1 on one of the first level tributaries in lower reaches table 1 we adopted method of double mass curve to check the consistency for each hydrometeorological factor searcy and hardison 1960 analogy method linear was adopted to interpolate or extend the missing series to build the same length of time series from 1956 to 2015 based on comparisons between the nearest stations surface distribution of climatic factors gained by using arcgis geostatistical analyst tool for interpolation zonal statistics then implemented to illustrate regional heterogeneity of the factors total annual streamflow 108m3 at observational sections were divided by catchment area km2 for regional hydrometeorology analysis in the unit of mm over the past 60 years there experienced warming and decreased precipitation and river discharge across the trb li et al 2015 basin hydrology and water availability face new perspectives challenges are critical for water resource planning and management of the trb as is a source region for water transfer to the water scarce loess area in northwest china impacts of climate change and human activities upon streamflow variation are of great importance on water availability with its rational utilization in the area 3 methodologies conceptual framework together with technique route of coupling methods of water balance and budyko hypothesis to obtain the partial differential equation for the derivative determination of the ecs were holistically illustrated in fig 2 estimation of et0 was conducted by using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1989 parameters for the estimation were defined according to local weather observations and field experiments pirkner et al 2014 li et al 2015 combined with those suggested in the fao irrigation and drainage paper allen et al 1989 observational series of precipitation and river discharge were used to calculate the ecs as input variables in the differential formulas the elasticity method and sensitivity method were adopted to compute influences of climatic factors on streamflow variation which provided a comparative assessment of the ec approach outputs the validated ec approach was used to disentangle contributions of climate change and human regulations on river discharge variations separations were conducted under 8 scenarios reflecting different hydrological transitions fig 2 3 1 the budyko equation and its derivations according to the famous budyko s hypothesis budyko 1974 the evaporative ratio aet p is as the function of the parameter φ et0 p where φ is the fao aridity index 1 aet p et 0 p tanh p et 0 1 exp et 0 p researchers have developed many types of mathematic expressions or methods choudhury 1999 donohue et al 2012 fu 1981 fu et al 2007 milly and dunne 2002 porporato et al 2004 wang and tang 2014 wang and zhou 2016 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 since the hypothesis proposed budyko hypothesis on aet s estimation was based on climatic factors which provides a considerable basis for separating contributions of climate change and human activities on basin hydrology variability donohue et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 wang and tang 2014 in this study we select equations developed by fu 1981 equation s1 and zhang et al 2001 equation s2 for a pilot exploration of climate driven hydrologic variations in the study area more details about these two equations can be found in the supplementary materials 3 2 effectiveness coefficient approach based on analytical derivation basin water balance could be expressed as 2 p q aet δ s where q is the annual channel streamflow and transferred into runoff depth mm δs is the basin water storage which evaporates or transpires in the post time and tends to be zero when given a relatively long time period dingman 2002 thus calculation for river discharge could be simplified as the difference between p and aet to date regional effectiveness of human s regulation on climatic p is still facing challenge we consider p as a complete climate controlled issue regional aet in larger watersheds was influenced by climate change coincided with land cover dynamics wang and hejazi 2011 the latter is reformed by anthropogenic impact at different levels discharge is determined as transformed from eq 2 3 q p aet c aet h where aet c is the regional aet dominated by climate change numerically equal to that of budyko equation eq 1 derived aet h is the aet induced by human activities both in units of mm purely climatically dominated river streamflow q c could then be described as 4 q c p aet where aet is under the framework of budyko hypothesis equals to aet c in eq 3 set parameter et0 p as φ eq 1 could be rewritten as 5 aet p φ tanh φ 1 1 exp φ the transformation of eq 4 is 6 q c p p φ tanh φ 1 1 exp φ note tanh φ 1 as s 1 exp φ as t eq 6 is transformed into 7 q c p p φ s t given independent variables of p and et0 changes of river discharge due to climate change could be described as donohue et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 8 δ q c q c p δ p q c et 0 δ et 0 parameters q c p and q c et 0 are defined as effectiveness coefficients ecp and ece of p and et0 to the changed discharge calculation of the partial derivatives could be a further deduction of δ q c results of partial derivatives of q c to p and et0 are respectively as the followed ec p 9 1 φ st p 2 φ st φ st p φ t 1 cosh 2 1 φ 1 et 0 φ φ st φ s p 10 ec e p 2 φ st st p φ t 1 cosh 2 1 φ 1 φ et 0 φ s φ st p given the observed series of p and p m method based estimation of et0 the climate dominated change of river discharge δ q c could be determined directly under the framework of budyko hypothesis 3 3 elasticity method and sensitivity method the elasticity method and sensitivity method were chosen to comprise with the effectiveness coefficient approach climate elasticity method proposed by schaake 1990 has been considered to quantify changes of streamflow under climate change including variations of long term precipitation and potential evapotranspiration 11 δ q c ε p δ p p ε et 0 δ et 0 et 0 q where ε p and ε et 0 are elasticity representing the effects of p and et0 to streamflow variation respectively in the sensitivity method changes of long term streamflow could be expressed when considering under climate change 12 δ q c β δ p γ δ et 0 where β and γ is the sensitivity index of streamflow to variations of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration more details and the calculation method of the above index ε p ε et 0 β and γ can be found in the supplementary materials equations s4 s6 s8 s9 3 4 decomposition of contributions the total change of streamflow can be described as 13 δ q δ q c δ q h generally anthropogenic impact strengthened along with economic and social development in certain regions also in most of area inhabits people both climate change and human activities influence hydrologic process including all time spans featuring wet normal or dry at multi yearly durations the above three hydrologic characteristics along with effectiveness or elasticity and sensitivity exploration before and after the changepoint would advance the study with more details for a given time span responding to any kind of hydrologic transition eq 13 would be 14 δ q i δ q ci δ q hi where i 1 2 3 represents the time span responding to hydrologic transition among wet normal or dry conditions containing at least one change breakpoint for the contribution percentage of climate change and human activities expressions are 15 f ci δ q ci δ q i f hi δ q hi δ q i where f ci and f hi are percentage of impact contributions of climate change and human activities on discharge variation respectively results of decomposition by ec approach would be compared with estimations by methods of elasticity schaake 1990 and sensitivity milly and dunne 2002 described as eqs s3 s9 in the supplementary materials eqs 8 11 and 12 make sense of how the three approaches functioning on explanation of climate change influences on streamflow variability time ranges could be defined according to objectives for different studies in a relatively long period of time computationally it is intuitionistic for effectiveness coefficients to explain climate change impacting on streamflow variation the elasticity indexes are good at clarifying the logistical linkages among relative departures of the variables the sensitive method focuses on sensitivity of channel process to climatic variations ideas of the three methods are from different aspects to explain the impact respond loop between the climate river systems the ec approach is mathematically based on partial differentiation emphasizing the original intention of climatological hypothesis on aet s estimation under the framework of budyko method 3 5 statistics statistics for time series were mainly conducted by using mann kendall test kendall 1955 mann 1945 and sen s slope method sen 1968 for estimation of variation trend and amplitude for all variables in different zones 4 results 4 1 variation of annual et0 and aet estimations of et0 by the p m equation were validated through comparing with 20 cm evaporation pan observed series the latter were modified by correction coefficients in diverse regions of the trb li et al 2015 results revealed a relatively high accuracy with a nash coefficient of near 0 85 water balance method was used to validate the budyko equation based estimation of aet comparison between budyko equation estimations and p minus runoff in diverse regions of the basin resulted in evaluation values of 0 89 and 0 78 for correlation coefficient and the nash coefficient respectively meant a satisfactory applicability of the approach li et al 2015 sen s slope method was used to test the variation amplitude of et0 and aet in the three diverse regions of the trb along with statistics of other hydrometeorological factors table 2 in the past 60 years there experienced an overall increase of et0 across the whole basin average annual total of et0 were estimated approximately in 619 620 and 679 mm in the up middle and down streams respectively by zonal statistics maintained rising from the semi humid cold region to the semi arid warm region in space highest et0 increase rate was found in the middle stream while in the upstream and downstream et0 fluctuated with relatively smaller increase rates annual total of aet estimated by budyko method were averaged approximately in 327 350 and 316 mm in areas of the grassland dominated upstream the forest grassland dominated middle stream and the sparse land cover and arid cultivation dominated downstream respectively increasing rate of aet was higher in the upstream than that in the middle stream while there presented a slight decrease trend in the downstream river discharge q presented decreasing in all the three regions dramatic reduction was found in upper reaches at a rate of 2 682 mm a table 2 4 2 influential index exploration for the three approaches 4 2 1 value distribution of effectiveness coefficients effects of p and et0 to variation of river discharge represented by the two parameters of ecp and ece could be determined according to eqs 9 and 10 pilot study resulted in values of ecp ranging from 0 11 to 0 87 while that of ece from 0 62 to 0 02 in the study area patterns of the calculated parameters compare to p and et0 were illustrated as in fig 3 some of the extreme values could not connect into lines because of the data isolations plus and minus signs meant enhancive or suppressive effectiveness of p and et0 to streamflow changes size of the absolute values corresponds to effective intensity fitting into positive correlation absolute values mean that the increment of runoff by increasing precipitation is tending to be balanced by the loss induced from potential evapotranspiration 4 2 2 comparisons with the other two approaches suitability of effectiveness coefficient ec approach evaluated by comparisons between calculations of ecs and the other two index based methods of elasticity ei and sensitivity si ec approach in this study was analytically derived from budyko hypothesis elasticity approach developed by dooge et al 1999 and arora 2002 separately were in different forms but same mechanism on measuring the streamflow elasticity to climate change we used the determined f φ in fu s equation 1981 to derive and obtain values of the elasticity index sensitivity approach by milly and dunne 2002 and parameter derivations by li et al 2007 based on zhang s equation 2001 were referenced to estimate the sensitivity index the most significant linear relationship between p induced and et0 induced influences was found under the framework of elasticity method for the inherent constraint of values sum of 1 eq s6 in supplementary material linear slope in fig 4 is 1 slope of sensitive fittings is mild and trends to the position with a little shift from ecs line reason may lie in the parameter ω introduced to reflect vegetation regulations on regional aet zhang et al 2001 which would made the land surface process be more sensitive to et0 all the indexes were computed in the three diverse regions across the trb data experiments resulted in larger range of elasticity index while parameter values were smaller according to the other two methods numerically below 1 in absolute values fig 4 index reflecting climatic p showed positive effectiveness on streamflow variation while that reflecting the climatic et0 showed negative absolute averages of parameters derived from approaches of ec and si decreased from upstream to downstream while that from ei method increased table 3 corresponding to the different mechanism between the three approaches reflecting influences of spatial heterogeneity of water heat conditions with their interactive effects on climate driven variations on streamflow across the basin streamflow variation was more sensitive in the semi humid and headwater area of upstream 4 3 contributions of climate change and human activities on streamflow variations 4 3 1 discharge variation and specific hydro transitions variations of discharge presented overall decreasing in all the monitoring stations controlled diverse regions of the trb during the time period from 1956 to 2015 breakpoints of the time series were identified by using different statistic methods of mann kendall pettitt buishand the standard normal homogeneity snh results showed highly agreement of variation trend and time of change among different region of the basin by using the methods time of the identified breakpoints were very close to the year of 1991 for example mann kendall method tested into a ufk ubk combined with ufk 0 at the year of 1991 the nearest one the significant decline was found 8 9 years later ufk u0 05 i e in fig 5 the year of 1999 in all the three reaches but with different variation amplitudes table 2 annual total of the 60 year observations were listed and we define the year corresponding to the largest 30 as the wet ones annual runoff depth 206 mm and the smallest 30 annual runoff depth 142 mm as dry ones the rest as the normal which was close to the division result gained from probability statistics given data settings as p 37 5 37 5 p 62 5 and p 62 5 for hydrological years of wet normal and dry respectively but with more coherence for analysis distribution of the hydro characteristics in years is illustrated as in fig 5 given the overall variation of the river discharge there were hydrologic transitions with smaller amplitude before and after the breakpoint of the year 1991 time series corresponding to specific hydro characteristics or that of approximately continuous transformation from combinations of wet normal dry to others were selected to design scenarios for contribution separations fig 5 and table 4 minimum length of statistical period was set to 5 years all parameters under different scenarios were calculated for separations of the climate and human due effectiveness on the varied river discharges 4 3 2 variation of observed discharge under different scenarios observed series of streamflow were divided by the area of catchment between hydro sections fig 1 for statistics in same unit in mm given the determination of δ q ci under the budyko hypothesis observed δ q i is the base for separation of the influence by human activities on streamflow changes δ q hi for the 8 scenarios there were 2 scenarios 3 and 5 set for the transformation from dry to wet corresponding to increase of river discharges most of the other 6 presented reduction of streamflow during the variation except for scenario 8 the separation under the dry regime between pre and post change of 1991 over a 60 year time span the streamflow in downstream increased it could be found that the overall decrease of basin discharge was mainly due to flow reduction in the up and middle streams fig 6 4 3 3 comparisons between index based separations by different approaches averages of index values in table 3 were used to separate the climatically influential contributions climate driven changes of streamflow δ q ci by the three index based methods were verified as high concordance fig 7 correlation coefficients between approach ec and ei si were 0 986 0 998 the overlapping of proofs to each other indicated considerable suitability of the three methods for decomposition of climatic influences on streamflow changes in the study area 4 3 4 quantified influences of climate change and human activities on streamflow variations results were found close to each other in ratios when the three methods were applied in diverse regions under same scenarios for example contribution ratios under scenario 1 were found 49 and 51 by using the ec and ei approaches while by using the si approach ratios were 51 and 49 quite closely for writing concision we use achievements derived by ec approach to present the contributions of climate and human activities under different situations of hydro transitions table 4 absolute influences of climatic factors and human regulations could be determined by ec approach under different scenarios in diverse regions there presented remarkable differences corresponding to various situations take results from scenarios 6 7 and 8 as examples human activities put obviously negative influences on river discharge under all the three scenarios in upper and middle reaches although it was found positive influences in lower reaches during wet and dry periods fig 8 over grazing and human regulations in rangelands in upper reaches along with extension of agriculture and varied cuttings of trees in middle reaches might lead to strong influences of human activities on river discharges there during the period of dry hydro years human issues played an important role in streamflow increase in the downstream when compared before and after the changepoint reasons might lie in the precipitation characteristics and human regulations on the hilly arable lands in the area the semi arid farming ecosystem would decline when drought occurred aet in the area would be suppressed also near bare land could facilitate generation of land surface runoff as rainfall in the area generally presented in a mode of short term and high intensity 4 3 5 contributions of climate and human activities to streamflow changes there were separately 3 4 5 and 4 scenarios which were testified with climate dominated changes in areas of the up middle downstream and the whole basin respectively statistics at basin scale presented an overall mean of the other zones fig 9 contributions of the two factors on streamflow change in diverse regions presented very different in time impacts by human activities were less than that of climate change in earlier stages influences of human activities were found considerable in the grassland covered semi humid upstream while climate change functioned remarkably in the sparse vegetation and rain fed farmland covered semi arid loess area in the downstream under most of the scenarios most of the transitions between different hydrometeorological conditions like wet to dry scenarios 1 2 4 or dry to wet scenarios 3 5 witnessed climate dominated streamflow changes contribution ratios of climate change averaged into 55 and 57 5 for the two variation patterns respectively although remarkable differences were also found in the diverse regions e g scenarios 1 and 4 wet to dry in upstream human activities contributed much more reasons might lie in changes of underlying conditions by artificial regulations during the period i e both grazing and fencing conservation facilitate vegetation regeneration wu et al 2009 which consequentially led to more water consumption through aet to satisfy physiological requirement for vegetation growth according to separations in wet years streamflow decrease induced more by human activities in the semi humid part the basin upper and middle reaches fig 9 u and m scenario 6 while in the lower semi arid reaches streamflow change controlled mainly by climate change fig 9d scenario 6 the slight decrease in downstream in normal times fig 6 scenario 7 was mainly human induced climate change made a positive effectiveness which a compensation to the negative influence by human activities fig 9d scenario 7 it was interesting that the increase of streamflow during dry years in the semi arid region was found mainly induced by human activities fig 9d scenario 8 the reason might lie in low survival rate of the rain fed ecology in dry years and the rainfall characteristics in the region i e short term duration severe intensity instantaneous effectiveness to land surface flow due to climate change might be amplified by artificial regulations of underlying conditions primarily climate change such as increase of t and decrease of p table 2 led to the first step decrease of river discharge in the region li et al 2015 contribution ratios of climate change went into 26 60 159 in areas of the upper middle and lower reaches of the trb during the period from 1956 to 2015 before and after the change breakpoint at the year of 1991 human activities played a second step negative role in the decreased streamflow in upper and middle reaches while that in lower reaches a positive compensation to climate induced reduction in river discharges overall contribution ratios of climate change and human regulations on streamflow decrease were 49 and 51 at the basin scale during whole period the latter functions a little more 5 discussions given the overlay of anthropogenic regulations on nature interactions between land surface process and atmospheric system become more and more complicated climate does not change by its own human activities could contribute to alter components in atmosphere which might lead to more complexity of climatic evolution although estimations of et0 by p m equation were mainly based on modification of local features the terminology of climate change in this study would still include climate changes induced by human systems that s to say separated contribution of climate change on streamflow might have contained portions from human regulations at this stage we could not get material to distinguish human activity induced climate changes also large basin generally features complicated eco geographical and hydro geomorphological differentiations unequal distribution of the finite monitoring stations are always near people s habitats uncertainties the above issues might cause are what we would like to critically tackle in the future streamflow q in long term would ultimately defined by difference between p and aet given the observed p and q aet by different drives climate change related or human regulation related are playing key roles in basin water balance for aet estimation budyko hypothesis emphasizes more at climate part or even the framework set for aet calculation is just including p and et0 this is fortunate for studies in which the relatively pure influence from climate change on hydrologic process needs to clarify most of the derivations for aet estimation introduced new parameter i e m in fu s equation or ω in zhang s equation to reflect possible influences of underlying conditions achievements might have included the part induced by human activities to the vertical process or at least there hides challenges on parameter settings to reflect that clearly especially in ecotone featured basin with high complexity of ecohydrology effectiveness coefficient approach we present in this study is based on budyko hypothesis and derived simply by mathematically differential deduction auxiliary variables against the dependent one δ q c are only the climatic p and et0 which made the separation easier to understand and conduct ideas of ec approach could also support to distinguish human induced changes in aet which could be helpful for assessment of land surface ecology by artificial regulations including cultivation or grazing observed change of streamflow might be less than the absolute amount induced by climate change or human activities consequences of impacts are lumped in river discharges given the excess of one influential factor induced the other one functions as compensation we consider it a realistic one when contribution ratio was over 100 in separations under the climatological hypothesis of the budyko method regional aet was estimated by p and et0 if land surface ecology is supported or partially by underground system especially where the annual aet is more than p like most desert ecosystem in the plain area of china s inland river basins ec approach would lead to huge uncertainties and might not to be applicable 6 conclusions we take the tao river basin as the study area to clarify climate change or human activity induced impacts on river discharge variations combined with water balance method the classic equation of budyko hypothesis were adopted for diagnosis of hydrometeorologic processes in diverse regions of the basin an analytical derivation approach ec based on the hypothesis was developed to conduct separations under different hydro transition scenarios main conclusions are as follows 1 climate induced runoff changes separated by ec approach presented good correlations with those distinguished by elasticity method and sensitivity method the approach was verified be applicable for contribution separations of runoff changes 2 statistically effectiveness of climate change and human regulations on streamflow variation may compensate to each other at large scale or during a long time period different hydro transition designs in diverse regions featuring heterogeneity of geography and ecology could help to understand contribution of the driven factors with more detail 3 there experienced complicated variations of streamflow across the trb separations brought about different results in diverse regions under various hydro transitional scenarios climate dominated runoff increase during dry wet transitions while human activities strengthened the wet dry transitions in the area especially runoff decreases in semi humid regions were mainly due to human regulations although in the semi arid area it was human regulations leading a positive influence to the increased river discharge in dry years overall river discharge declined obviously as the whole at the basin scale the decreased variation was separated into contribution ratios of 49 and 51 for climate change and human activities respectively during the time period from 1956 to 2015 acknowledgments this study was supported by

7367,climate variability and anthropogenic regulations are two interwoven factors in the ecohydrologic system across large basins understanding the roles that these two factors play under various hydrologic conditions is of great significance for basin hydrology and sustainable water utilization in this study we present an analytical approach based on coupling water balance method and budyko hypothesis to derive effectiveness coefficients ecs of climate change as a way to disentangle contributions of it and human activities to the variability of river discharges under different hydro transitional situations the climate dominated streamflow change δ q c by ec approach was compared with those deduced by the elasticity method and sensitivity index the results suggest that the ec approach is valid and applicable for hydrologic study at large basin scale analyses of various scenarios revealed that contributions of climate change and human activities to river discharge variation differed among the regions of the study area over the past several decades climate change dominated hydro transitions from dry to wet while human activities played key roles in the reduction of streamflow during wet to dry periods remarkable decline of discharge in upstream was mainly due to human interventions although climate contributed more to runoff increasing during dry periods in the semi arid downstream induced effectiveness on streamflow changes indicated a contribution ratio of 49 for climate and 51 for human activities at the basin scale from 1956 to 2015 the mathematic derivation based simple approach together with the case example of temporal segmentation and spatial zoning could help people understand variation of river discharge with more details at a large basin

garrote et al 2016 henriques et al 2015 pires et al 2017 as a consequence river discharge of many basins departed significantly from their natural variability without a holistic understanding of basin hydrology particularly the river discharge variability and its causes the risk in water security is likely to be high basin hydrology consists of processes in the atmosphere down to the land surface

hydrologic events such as river discharges are often a result of complex interactions between climate change and anthropogenic activities silveira et al 2017 this complexity represents a challenge to separate contributions from climate change to observed streamflow variation ye et al 2013 studies on this complexity could help better understand how and why streamflow varies and informed management decision to adapt future water stresses khalil et al 2005 especially in water scarce regions for a natural system climate plays an important role in transitions between wet normal and dry conditions corresponding to high normal and low flows in river discharge goler et al 2016 shabalova et al 2003 human activities exert additional fluctuations to strengthen or weaken the natural variations guo et al 2015 at a basin level intensity of human impacts is tightly linked to changes of underlying condition and actual evapotranspiration aet which is primarily controlled by regional water energy patterns moyano et al 2015 senay et al 2011 as strengthened human regulations changed land surface more and more basin hydrology appears with higher complexity physically quantifying major hydrologic variables like aet or river discharge with their variations faces challenges coupling classic methods of climatology and water balance is of reliable feasibility to comprehensively disentangle contributions to river discharge variations due to climate change and human activities qiu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 methodologically therefore separation of human influences from climate impacts on river streamflow can be categorized into two types one is based on water balance where separation of the two can be made through determination of aet the other is based on water energy shifts which reflect some general insights of streamflow variations bosshard et al 2013 it is obvious that the first approach aims at quantitative separation while the latter features particular emphasis on

real outputs of aet underlying conditions are considered i e zhang et al 2001 wang and hejazi 2011 the introduced parameters often varied with climate vegetation and soils and thus are difficult to quantify the variability and difficulty of determining these parameters often introduce some uncertainties for separation of human and climate impacts on river streamflow jiang et al 2015 ye et al 2013 zeng et al 2015 in this study we presented an analytical approach based on partial derivatives under the framework of coupling basin water balance and the budyko hypothesis which made determination of climatic influences on river discharge variation more simply and mathematically understanding furthermore various scenarios settings for different hydro transitions in diverse regions for contribution decomposition were conducted ideas of temporal segmentation and spatial zoning could help contribution separation working with more details which would help people understand variation of river discharge and then manage the basin resources better under dual impacts of climate change and human activities findings could be a case example for comprehensive studies on basin hydrology in the perspective of complicated ecohydrologic variations in time and space 2 study area and data the tao river basin trb is the second largest tributary of the upper yellow river in northwestern china geographically located between 101 36 e and 104 20 e 34 06 n and 36 01 with a total area of 25 527 km2 and a multi yearly average annual total of 46 13 108 m3 in discharge 1956 2015 the basin features an elevation range from 1730 4560 m covers portions of the eastern tibetan plateau 4560 2800 m and southwestern loess plateau 2800 1730 m from upstream to downstream annual mean air temperature increased from lower than 2 c to over 8 c from the west part of the basin to the east while precipitation decreased from over 600 mm in the west to about 350 mm in the northeast high complexity of ecohydrology was found across the whole basin fig 1 according to the remarkable heterogeneity of hydrometeorology and land cover in space we divide the whole basin into upper middle and lower areas along with considering the industrial mode across the trb it features a relatively flat topography with open valleys and dominates grasslands in the upper reaches while the meandering river is surrounded by high mountains covered mainly by forests and grasses in the middle reaches the river flows into loess plateau in the lower reaches where vegetation with low coverage occupied about 21 resulted in relatively severe water and soil loss the industrial modes transit from grazing dominated in the upper area to the rain fed agriculture dominated in the lower area while in the middle area it features a mixture of forestry grazing and farming we collected hydrometeorological series in or near the trb from china meteorological data sharing network http data cma cn and gansu province bureau of hydrology and water resources monitoring including 10 standard weather stations 22 rainfall gauge stations and 6 hydrological observational stations 5 on main stream and 1 on one of the first level tributaries in lower reaches table 1 we adopted method of double mass curve to check the consistency for each hydrometeorological factor searcy and hardison 1960 analogy method linear was adopted to interpolate or extend the missing series to build the same length of time series from 1956 to 2015 based on comparisons between the nearest stations surface distribution of climatic factors gained by using arcgis geostatistical analyst tool for interpolation zonal statistics then implemented to illustrate regional heterogeneity of the factors total annual streamflow 108m3 at observational sections were divided by catchment area km2 for regional hydrometeorology analysis in the unit of mm over the past 60 years there experienced warming and decreased precipitation and river discharge across the trb li et al 2015 basin hydrology and water availability face new perspectives challenges are critical for water resource planning and management of the trb as is a source region for water transfer to the water scarce loess area in northwest china impacts of climate change and human activities upon streamflow variation are of great importance on water availability with its rational utilization in the area 3 methodologies conceptual framework together with technique route of coupling methods of water balance and budyko hypothesis to obtain the partial differential equation for the derivative determination of the ecs were holistically illustrated in fig 2 estimation of et0 was conducted by using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1989 parameters for the estimation were defined according to local weather observations and field experiments pirkner et al 2014 li et al 2015 combined with those suggested in the fao irrigation and drainage paper allen et al 1989 observational series of precipitation and river discharge were used to calculate the ecs as input variables in the differential formulas the elasticity method and sensitivity method were adopted to compute influences of climatic factors on streamflow variation which provided a comparative assessment of the ec approach outputs the validated ec approach was used to disentangle contributions of climate change and human regulations on river discharge variations separations were conducted under 8 scenarios reflecting different hydrological transitions fig 2 3 1 the budyko equation and its derivations according to the famous budyko s hypothesis budyko 1974 the evaporative ratio aet p is as the function of the parameter φ et0 p where φ is the fao aridity index 1 aet p et 0 p tanh p et 0 1 exp et 0 p researchers have developed many types of mathematic expressions or methods choudhury 1999 donohue et al 2012 fu 1981 fu et al 2007 milly and dunne 2002 porporato et al 2004 wang and tang 2014 wang and zhou 2016 yang et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 since the hypothesis proposed budyko hypothesis on aet s estimation was based on climatic factors which provides a considerable basis for separating contributions of climate change and human activities on basin hydrology variability donohue et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 wang and tang 2014 in this study we select equations developed by fu 1981 equation s1 and zhang et al 2001 equation s2 for a pilot exploration of climate driven hydrologic variations in the study area more details about these two equations can be found in the supplementary materials 3 2 effectiveness coefficient approach based on analytical derivation basin water balance could be expressed as 2 p q aet δ s where q is the annual channel streamflow and transferred into runoff depth mm δs is the basin water storage which evaporates or transpires in the post time and tends to be zero when given a relatively long time period dingman 2002 thus calculation for river discharge could be simplified as the difference between p and aet to date regional effectiveness of human s regulation on climatic p is still facing challenge we consider p as a complete climate controlled issue regional aet in larger watersheds was influenced by climate change coincided with land cover dynamics wang and hejazi 2011 the latter is reformed by anthropogenic impact at different levels discharge is determined as transformed from eq 2 3 q p aet c aet h where aet c is the regional aet dominated by climate change numerically equal to that of budyko equation eq 1 derived aet h is the aet induced by human activities both in units of mm purely climatically dominated river streamflow q c could then be described as 4 q c p aet where aet is under the framework of budyko hypothesis equals to aet c in eq 3 set parameter et0 p as φ eq 1 could be rewritten as 5 aet p φ tanh φ 1 1 exp φ the transformation of eq 4 is 6 q c p p φ tanh φ 1 1 exp φ note tanh φ 1 as s 1 exp φ as t eq 6 is transformed into 7 q c p p φ s t given independent variables of p and et0 changes of river discharge due to climate change could be described as donohue et al 2011 jiang et al 2015 8 δ q c q c p δ p q c et 0 δ et 0 parameters q c p and q c et 0 are defined as effectiveness coefficients ecp and ece of p and et0 to the changed discharge calculation of the partial derivatives could be a further deduction of δ q c results of partial derivatives of q c to p and et0 are respectively as the followed ec p 9 1 φ st p 2 φ st φ st p φ t 1 cosh 2 1 φ 1 et 0 φ φ st φ s p 10 ec e p 2 φ st st p φ t 1 cosh 2 1 φ 1 φ et 0 φ s φ st p given the observed series of p and p m method based estimation of et0 the climate dominated change of river discharge δ q c could be determined directly under the framework of budyko hypothesis 3 3 elasticity method and sensitivity method the elasticity method and sensitivity method were chosen to comprise with the effectiveness coefficient approach climate elasticity method proposed by schaake 1990 has been considered to quantify changes of streamflow under climate change including variations of long term precipitation and potential evapotranspiration 11 δ q c ε p δ p p ε et 0 δ et 0 et 0 q where ε p and ε et 0 are elasticity representing the effects of p and et0 to streamflow variation respectively in the sensitivity method changes of long term streamflow could be expressed when considering under climate change 12 δ q c β δ p γ δ et 0 where β and γ is the sensitivity index of streamflow to variations of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration more details and the calculation method of the above index ε p ε et 0 β and γ can be found in the supplementary materials equations s4 s6 s8 s9 3 4 decomposition of contributions the total change of streamflow can be described as 13 δ q δ q c δ q h generally anthropogenic impact strengthened along with economic and social development in certain regions also in most of area inhabits people both climate change and human activities influence hydrologic process including all time spans featuring wet normal or dry at multi yearly durations the above three hydrologic characteristics along with effectiveness or elasticity and sensitivity exploration before and after the changepoint would advance the study with more details for a given time span responding to any kind of hydrologic transition eq 13 would be 14 δ q i δ q ci δ q hi where i 1 2 3 represents the time span responding to hydrologic transition among wet normal or dry conditions containing at least one change breakpoint for the contribution percentage of climate change and human activities expressions are 15 f ci δ q ci δ q i f hi δ q hi δ q i where f ci and f hi are percentage of impact contributions of climate change and human activities on discharge variation respectively results of decomposition by ec approach would be compared with estimations by methods of elasticity schaake 1990 and sensitivity milly and dunne 2002 described as eqs s3 s9 in the supplementary materials eqs 8 11 and 12 make sense of how the three approaches functioning on explanation of climate change influences on streamflow variability time ranges could be defined according to objectives for different studies in a relatively long period of time computationally it is intuitionistic for effectiveness coefficients to explain climate change impacting on streamflow variation the elasticity indexes are good at clarifying the logistical linkages among relative departures of the variables the sensitive method focuses on sensitivity of channel process to climatic variations ideas of the three methods are from different aspects to explain the impact respond loop between the climate river systems the ec approach is mathematically based on partial differentiation emphasizing the original intention of climatological hypothesis on aet s estimation under the framework of budyko method 3 5 statistics statistics for time series were mainly conducted by using mann kendall test kendall 1955 mann 1945 and sen s slope method sen 1968 for estimation of variation trend and amplitude for all variables in different zones 4 results 4 1 variation of annual et0 and aet estimations of et0 by the p m equation were validated through comparing with 20 cm evaporation pan observed series the latter were modified by correction coefficients in diverse regions of the trb li et al 2015 results revealed a relatively high accuracy with a nash coefficient of near 0 85 water balance method was used to validate the budyko equation based estimation of aet comparison between budyko equation estimations and p minus runoff in diverse regions of the basin resulted in evaluation values of 0 89 and 0 78 for correlation coefficient and the nash coefficient respectively meant a satisfactory applicability of the approach li et al 2015 sen s slope method was used to test the variation amplitude of et0 and aet in the three diverse regions of the trb along with statistics of other hydrometeorological factors table 2 in the past 60 years there experienced an overall increase of et0 across the whole basin average annual total of et0 were estimated approximately in 619 620 and 679 mm in the up middle and down streams respectively by zonal statistics maintained rising from the semi humid cold region to the semi arid warm region in space highest et0 increase rate was found in the middle stream while in the upstream and downstream et0 fluctuated with relatively smaller increase rates annual total of aet estimated by budyko method were averaged approximately in 327 350 and 316 mm in areas of the grassland dominated upstream the forest grassland dominated middle stream and the sparse land cover and arid cultivation dominated downstream respectively increasing rate of aet was higher in the upstream than that in the middle stream while there presented a slight decrease trend in the downstream river discharge q presented decreasing in all the three regions dramatic reduction was found in upper reaches at a rate of 2 682 mm a table 2 4 2 influential index exploration for the three approaches 4 2 1 value distribution of effectiveness coefficients effects of p and et0 to variation of river discharge represented by the two parameters of ecp and ece could be determined according to eqs 9 and 10 pilot study resulted in values of ecp ranging from 0 11 to 0 87 while that of ece from 0 62 to 0 02 in the study area patterns of the calculated parameters compare to p and et0 were illustrated as in fig 3 some of the extreme values could not connect into lines because of the data isolations plus and minus signs meant enhancive or suppressive effectiveness of p and et0 to streamflow changes size of the absolute values corresponds to effective intensity fitting into positive correlation absolute values mean that the increment of runoff by increasing precipitation is tending to be balanced by the loss induced from potential evapotranspiration 4 2 2 comparisons with the other two approaches suitability of effectiveness coefficient ec approach evaluated by comparisons between calculations of ecs and the other two index based methods of elasticity ei and sensitivity si ec approach in this study was analytically derived from budyko hypothesis elasticity approach developed by dooge et al 1999 and arora 2002 separately were in different forms but same mechanism on measuring the streamflow elasticity to climate change we used the determined f φ in fu s equation 1981 to derive and obtain values of the elasticity index sensitivity approach by milly and dunne 2002 and parameter derivations by li et al 2007 based on zhang s equation 2001 were referenced to estimate the sensitivity index the most significant linear relationship between p induced and et0 induced influences was found under the framework of elasticity method for the inherent constraint of values sum of 1 eq s6 in supplementary material linear slope in fig 4 is 1 slope of sensitive fittings is mild and trends to the position with a little shift from ecs line reason may lie in the parameter ω introduced to reflect vegetation regulations on regional aet zhang et al 2001 which would made the land surface process be more sensitive to et0 all the indexes were computed in the three diverse regions across the trb data experiments resulted in larger range of elasticity index while parameter values were smaller according to the other two methods numerically below 1 in absolute values fig 4 index reflecting climatic p showed positive effectiveness on streamflow variation while that reflecting the climatic et0 showed negative absolute averages of parameters derived from approaches of ec and si decreased from upstream to downstream while that from ei method increased table 3 corresponding to the different mechanism between the three approaches reflecting influences of spatial heterogeneity of water heat conditions with their interactive effects on climate driven variations on streamflow across the basin streamflow variation was more sensitive in the semi humid and headwater area of upstream 4 3 contributions of climate change and human activities on streamflow variations 4 3 1 discharge variation and specific hydro transitions variations of discharge presented overall decreasing in all the monitoring stations controlled diverse regions of the trb during the time period from 1956 to 2015 breakpoints of the time series were identified by using different statistic methods of mann kendall pettitt buishand the standard normal homogeneity snh results showed highly agreement of variation trend and time of change among different region of the basin by using the methods time of the identified breakpoints were very close to the year of 1991 for example mann kendall method tested into a ufk ubk combined with ufk 0 at the year of 1991 the nearest one the significant decline was found 8 9 years later ufk u0 05 i e in fig 5 the year of 1999 in all the three reaches but with different variation amplitudes table 2 annual total of the 60 year observations were listed and we define the year corresponding to the largest 30 as the wet ones annual runoff depth 206 mm and the smallest 30 annual runoff depth 142 mm as dry ones the rest as the normal which was close to the division result gained from probability statistics given data settings as p 37 5 37 5 p 62 5 and p 62 5 for hydrological years of wet normal and dry respectively but with more coherence for analysis distribution of the hydro characteristics in years is illustrated as in fig 5 given the overall variation of the river discharge there were hydrologic transitions with smaller amplitude before and after the breakpoint of the year 1991 time series corresponding to specific hydro characteristics or that of approximately continuous transformation from combinations of wet normal dry to others were selected to design scenarios for contribution separations fig 5 and table 4 minimum length of statistical period was set to 5 years all parameters under different scenarios were calculated for separations of the climate and human due effectiveness on the varied river discharges 4 3 2 variation of observed discharge under different scenarios observed series of streamflow were divided by the area of catchment between hydro sections fig 1 for statistics in same unit in mm given the determination of δ q ci under the budyko hypothesis observed δ q i is the base for separation of the influence by human activities on streamflow changes δ q hi for the 8 scenarios there were 2 scenarios 3 and 5 set for the transformation from dry to wet corresponding to increase of river discharges most of the other 6 presented reduction of streamflow during the variation except for scenario 8 the separation under the dry regime between pre and post change of 1991 over a 60 year time span the streamflow in downstream increased it could be found that the overall decrease of basin discharge was mainly due to flow reduction in the up and middle streams fig 6 4 3 3 comparisons between index based separations by different approaches averages of index values in table 3 were used to separate the climatically influential contributions climate driven changes of streamflow δ q ci by the three index based methods were verified as high concordance fig 7 correlation coefficients between approach ec and ei si were 0 986 0 998 the overlapping of proofs to each other indicated considerable suitability of the three methods for decomposition of climatic influences on streamflow changes in the study area 4 3 4 quantified influences of climate change and human activities on streamflow variations results were found close to each other in ratios when the three methods were applied in diverse regions under same scenarios for example contribution ratios under scenario 1 were found 49 and 51 by using the ec and ei approaches while by using the si approach ratios were 51 and 49 quite closely for writing concision we use achievements derived by ec approach to present the contributions of climate and human activities under different situations of hydro transitions table 4 absolute influences of climatic factors and human regulations could be determined by ec approach under different scenarios in diverse regions there presented remarkable differences corresponding to various situations take results from scenarios 6 7 and 8 as examples human activities put obviously negative influences on river discharge under all the three scenarios in upper and middle reaches although it was found positive influences in lower reaches during wet and dry periods fig 8 over grazing and human regulations in rangelands in upper reaches along with extension of agriculture and varied cuttings of trees in middle reaches might lead to strong influences of human activities on river discharges there during the period of dry hydro years human issues played an important role in streamflow increase in the downstream when compared before and after the changepoint reasons might lie in the precipitation characteristics and human regulations on the hilly arable lands in the area the semi arid farming ecosystem would decline when drought occurred aet in the area would be suppressed also near bare land could facilitate generation of land surface runoff as rainfall in the area generally presented in a mode of short term and high intensity 4 3 5 contributions of climate and human activities to streamflow changes there were separately 3 4 5 and 4 scenarios which were testified with climate dominated changes in areas of the up middle downstream and the whole basin respectively statistics at basin scale presented an overall mean of the other zones fig 9 contributions of the two factors on streamflow change in diverse regions presented very different in time impacts by human activities were less than that of climate change in earlier stages influences of human activities were found considerable in the grassland covered semi humid upstream while climate change functioned remarkably in the sparse vegetation and rain fed farmland covered semi arid loess area in the downstream under most of the scenarios most of the transitions between different hydrometeorological conditions like wet to dry scenarios 1 2 4 or dry to wet scenarios 3 5 witnessed climate dominated streamflow changes contribution ratios of climate change averaged into 55 and 57 5 for the two variation patterns respectively although remarkable differences were also found in the diverse regions e g scenarios 1 and 4 wet to dry in upstream human activities contributed much more reasons might lie in changes of underlying conditions by artificial regulations during the period i e both grazing and fencing conservation facilitate vegetation regeneration wu et al 2009 which consequentially led to more water consumption through aet to satisfy physiological requirement for vegetation growth according to separations in wet years streamflow decrease induced more by human activities in the semi humid part the basin upper and middle reaches fig 9 u and m scenario 6 while in the lower semi arid reaches streamflow change controlled mainly by climate change fig 9d scenario 6 the slight decrease in downstream in normal times fig 6 scenario 7 was mainly human induced climate change made a positive effectiveness which a compensation to the negative influence by human activities fig 9d scenario 7 it was interesting that the increase of streamflow during dry years in the semi arid region was found mainly induced by human activities fig 9d scenario 8 the reason might lie in low survival rate of the rain fed ecology in dry years and the rainfall characteristics in the region i e short term duration severe intensity instantaneous effectiveness to land surface flow due to climate change might be amplified by artificial regulations of underlying conditions primarily climate change such as increase of t and decrease of p table 2 led to the first step decrease of river discharge in the region li et al 2015 contribution ratios of climate change went into 26 60 159 in areas of the upper middle and lower reaches of the trb during the period from 1956 to 2015 before and after the change breakpoint at the year of 1991 human activities played a second step negative role in the decreased streamflow in upper and middle reaches while that in lower reaches a positive compensation to climate induced reduction in river discharges overall contribution ratios of climate change and human regulations on streamflow decrease were 49 and 51 at the basin scale during whole period the latter functions a little more 5 discussions given the overlay of anthropogenic regulations on nature interactions between land surface process and atmospheric system become more and more complicated climate does not change by its own human activities could contribute to alter components in atmosphere which might lead to more complexity of climatic evolution although estimations of et0 by p m equation were mainly based on modification of local features the terminology of climate change in this study would still include climate changes induced by human systems that s to say separated contribution of climate change on streamflow might have contained portions from human regulations at this stage we could not get material to distinguish human activity induced climate changes also large basin generally features complicated eco geographical and hydro geomorphological differentiations unequal distribution of the finite monitoring stations are always near people s habitats uncertainties the above issues might cause are what we would like to critically tackle in the future streamflow q in long term would ultimately defined by difference between p and aet given the observed p and q aet by different drives climate change related or human regulation related are playing key roles in basin water balance for aet estimation budyko hypothesis emphasizes more at climate part or even the framework set for aet calculation is just including p and et0 this is fortunate for studies in which the relatively pure influence from climate change on hydrologic process needs to clarify most of the derivations for aet estimation introduced new parameter i e m in fu s equation or ω in zhang s equation to reflect possible influences of underlying conditions achievements might have included the part induced by human activities to the vertical process or at least there hides challenges on parameter settings to reflect that clearly especially in ecotone featured basin with high complexity of ecohydrology effectiveness coefficient approach we present in this study is based on budyko hypothesis and derived simply by mathematically differential deduction auxiliary variables against the dependent one δ q c are only the climatic p and et0 which made the separation easier to understand and conduct ideas of ec approach could also support to distinguish human induced changes in aet which could be helpful for assessment of land surface ecology by artificial regulations including cultivation or grazing observed change of streamflow might be less than the absolute amount induced by climate change or human activities consequences of impacts are lumped in river discharges given the excess of one influential factor induced the other one functions as compensation we consider it a realistic one when contribution ratio was over 100 in separations under the climatological hypothesis of the budyko method regional aet was estimated by p and et0 if land surface ecology is supported or partially by underground system especially where the annual aet is more than p like most desert ecosystem in the plain area of china s inland river basins ec approach would lead to huge uncertainties and might not to be applicable 6 conclusions we take the tao river basin as the study area to clarify climate change or human activity induced impacts on river discharge variations combined with water balance method the classic equation of budyko hypothesis were adopted for diagnosis of hydrometeorologic processes in diverse regions of the basin an analytical derivation approach ec based on the hypothesis was developed to conduct separations under different hydro transition scenarios main conclusions are as follows 1 climate induced runoff changes separated by ec approach presented good correlations with those distinguished by elasticity method and sensitivity method the approach was verified be applicable for contribution separations of runoff changes 2 statistically effectiveness of climate change and human regulations on streamflow variation may compensate to each other at large scale or during a long time period different hydro transition designs in diverse regions featuring heterogeneity of geography and ecology could help to understand contribution of the driven factors with more detail 3 there experienced complicated variations of streamflow across the trb separations brought about different results in diverse regions under various hydro transitional scenarios climate dominated runoff increase during dry wet transitions while human activities strengthened the wet dry transitions in the area especially runoff decreases in semi humid regions were mainly due to human regulations although in the semi arid area it was human regulations leading a positive influence to the increased river discharge in dry years overall river discharge declined obviously as the whole at the basin scale the decreased variation was separated into contribution ratios of 49 and 51 for climate change and human activities respectively during the time period from 1956 to 2015 acknowledgments this study was supported by

7368,sea level rise has already caused more frequent and severe coastal flooding and this trend will likely continue flood prediction is an essential part of a coastal city s capacity to adapt to and mitigate this growing problem complex coastal urban hydrological systems however do not always lend themselves easily to physically based flood prediction approaches this paper presents a method for using a data driven approach to estimate flood severity in an urban coastal setting using crowd sourced data a non traditional but growing data source along with environmental observation data two data driven models poisson regression and random forest regression are trained to predict the number of flood reports per storm event as a proxy for flood severity given extensive environmental data i e rainfall tide groundwater table level and wind conditions as input the method is demonstrated using data from norfolk virginia usa from september 2010 to october 2016 quality controlled crowd sourced street flooding reports ranging from 1 to 159 per storm event for 45 storm events are used to train and evaluate the models random forest performed better than poisson regression at predicting the number of flood reports and had a lower false negative rate from the random forest model total cumulative rainfall was by far the most dominant input variable in predicting flood severity followed by low tide and lower low tide these methods serve as a first step toward using data driven methods for spatially and temporally detailed coastal urban flood prediction keywords flood modeling data driven models urban hydrology coastal flooding 1 introduction flooding in low lying coastal cities has become more common in recent years due to climate change and relative sea level rise sweet and park 2014 in the coming decades relative sea level is expected to rise substantially vermeer and rahmstorf 2009 church et al 2001 which will worsen the problem of flooding in coastal cities flooding in coastal cities is caused by large life threatening high return period events such as hurricanes harvey and irma whose flooding recently affected coastal cities in texas and florida usa respectively additionally many coastal cities have low relief terrain and low elevation making stormwater drainage problematic this can make coastal cities susceptible to flooding from smaller low return period events such as severe thunderstorms the long term effects of legacy engineering decisions can further add to an urban city s flood risk e g the use of non engineered fill used to reclaim streams which causes higher than average subsidence rates turner 2004 the ability to accurately predict flooding allows decision makers to proactively mitigate the effects of flooding zevenbergen et al 2008 which is key to a city s resilience to natural hazards godschalk 2003 accurate flood prediction allows decision makers to maximize safety in the case of large events and minimize infrastructure damage and social and economic disruption in the case of smaller events accurate flood prediction also allows cyber physical or smart stormwater systems to perform optimally further mitigating the effects of flooding kerkez et al 2016 modeling and predicting flooding in urban coastal environments can be challenging urban coastal floods are influenced by a combination of different environmental geographic and human related factors gallien et al 2014 environmental factors that contribute to coastal flooding include rainfall wind tide levels and ground water table levels geographic factors such as elevation soil properties proximity to the coast and the land use and land cover of the drainage area can influence whether a given location experiences flooding in urban settings human related factors including built stormwater infrastructure which is often underground and the condition of that infrastructure also play a role in the location and severity of flooding for example clogged stormwater inlets and undersized stormwater pipes can increase the chance and severity of flooding high tidal levels can inundate stormwater outfalls rendering them ineffective at draining stormwater to the ocean a condition which will become more frequent with sea level rise the need to accurately represent such systems and their changing conditions further adds to the complexity of urban flood modeling urban coastal flood events can be modeled using physically based 1d mark et al 2004 or 2d models mignot et al 2006 hunter et al 2008 bates et al 2005 smith et al 2011 gallien et al 2014 however the simplified representations of reality used in physically based models can be a limitation given the combination of variables and their interactions and the complexity of the physical environment two dimensional hydrodynamic models make fewer simplifications compared to 1d models however this comes at a larger computational cost leandro et al 2009 which makes executing and especially calibrating a 2d model difficult caviedes voullième et al 2012 another modeling approach shown to be effective in many fields yang et al 2017a including hydrology solomatine and ostfeld 2008 is data driven modeling data driven models detect patterns in the data to map model inputs to model outputs without attempting to simulate the physical processes solomatine and ostfeld 2008 thus the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not assumed as in physically based models but learned while physical processes are not directly simulated using data driven models understanding of physical processes usually influences the selection of input variables used to predict the output variable booker and woods 2014 the recent increase in availability of earth observation data coupled with advances in machine learning algorithms have expanded the possibilities and use of data driven modeling in hydrology machine learning algorithms have been used extensively in hydrology for applications such as predicting reservoir operations yang et al 2016 soil mineral weathering povak et al 2014 streamflow yang et al 2017b solomatine and xue 2004 wang et al 2009 groundwater potential naghibi et al 2017 and groundwater level sahoo et al 2017 data driven and machine learning algorithms in flooding applications specifically have been used by tehrany et al 2013 wang et al 2015 and tien bui et al 2016 who predicted areas susceptible to flooding adamovic et al 2016 who modeled flash flooding on a regional scale and solomatine and xue 2004 who predicted streamflow for flood forecasting despite the expanded use of data driven models in hydrology few studies have used data driven methods to model flooding within coastal urban environments the closest work may be the statistical analysis of tidal records in the united states to estimate the amount of time that coastal cities have experienced flooding in the past several decades and project flooding in the coming decades ezer and atkinson 2014 sweet and park 2014 moftakhari et al 2015 ray and foster 2016 the objective of this study is to use data driven modeling to predict flooding severity for a given storm in an urban coastal setting crowd sourced flood reports recorded during flood events are used for model training and are considered a proxy variable for flood severity although a more objective measure of flood severity is preferred to the number of flood reports e g flood inundation depth and duration throughout the study domain often such data is not available relevant environmental data rainfall tide levels water table level wind speed and direction will be used as inputs to the model a data driven approach is appropriate for this application due to the complexity of modeling urban coastal flooding as discussed above which makes using a physical model difficult this paper will investigate and compare two different data driven models poisson regression and random forest regression poisson regression is a generalized linear model and was selected because it is commonly used to model rare events d unger et al 1998 and a flood report while increasing in occurrence can still be considered a rare event random forest was selected due to its wide use as a machine learning algorithm in hydrology applications yang et al 2016 wang et al 2015 loos and elsenbeer 2011 and other fields e g mutanga et al 2012 svetnik et al 2003 the data driven approach will be applied in norfolk virginia usa norfolk and the surrounding hampton roads region is one of the most vulnerable metropolitan centers to coastal flooding in the usa fears 2012 since 2010 the city has collected quality controlled crowd sourced street flooding reports for 45 storm events in this study the two data driven models poisson regression and random forest regression will be trained to predict the number of street flood reports per storm event given the rainfall tidal water table and wind characteristics of the storm event the models will be evaluated and compared using primarily the root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae between the predicted number of street flood reports and the actual number of street flood reports this is a first step toward the use of data driven approaches in urban coastal flood modeling additionally although gaitan et al 2016 employed exploratory methods to glean information from open spatial data weather data and user reports the use of crowd sourced data in the training and evaluation of data driven predictive models for urban flood modeling has not been demonstrated or discussed thoroughly in the literature this is relevant currently as multiple platforms now exist for collecting crowd sourced information regarding urban flooding le coz et al 2016 and it can be expected that due to the nearly universal use of internet connected devices crowd sourced data will continue to grow in volume the results of the modeling also shed light on the relative importance of different environmental factors in predicting coastal flooding another subject that has been given little attention in previous literature regarding urban coastal flooding the remainder of this paper will proceed as follows first background will be given describing the study area the model input and output data and an introduction to the data driven models used next the methods are presented describing the preparation of the data for the models and how the data driven models were applied and evaluated the model results are then presented and discussed and finally conclusions are given 2 study area data and model background 2 1 study area and street flooding record norfolk virginia usa shown in fig 1 is an ideal study area for this research considering its vulnerability to flooding its economic and military importance and the availability of quality controlled crowd sourced data regarding flood occurrences for the city norfolk is one of the most vulnerable cities to coastal flooding in the usa due largely to land subsidence rates causing norfolk and the surrounding area to experience relative sea level rise at a rate faster than the global average kleinosky et al 2006 as home to the largest terminal of the port of virginia the 3rd most used port on the east coast of the us the port of virginia 2016 norfolk plays an important role in the economy of virginia and the surrounding states the world s largest naval base naval station norfolk is also within norfolk making the flooding risks in the area important to us national security broder 2009 an important factor in selecting the study area was the availability of crowd sourced flood report data a record of reported flooded street locations has been kept in norfolk starting with hurricane nicole on 30 september 2010 shown in fig 1 this is a unique dataset because often observational data from flooding events is a limiting factor in creating useful flood models smith et al 2011 because such data is often sparse photographs of flooded locations and personal interviews have been used out of necessity in the calibration and verification of flood models smith et al 2011 even satellite imagery has been used to estimate flooding extents ireland et al 2015 but is less useful as a street scale flood record in an urban setting due to its coarse spatial resolution 2 2 description of model input and output data the objective of this study is to develop a model capable of predicting flooding severity resulting from a given storm event based on the environmental conditions of that event the environmental condition input data for the model consisted of rainfall water table level wind and tide level observations these were obtained from the hampton roads sanitation district hrsd and the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa from hrsd rainfall water table elevation wind direction and wind speed data were obtained the rainfall observations were on a 15 min time scale and the water table elevations and wind data were on a 2 min time scale from noaa 6 min water elevations and daily high and low tides recorded at the sewells point noaa 2017a and money point noaa 2017b tide gauges were obtained wind speed wind gust and wind direction data recorded at the money point station at 6 min time intervals were used as well daily rainfall and wind data collected at two airports in the study area norfolk international airport noaa 2017c and norfolk naval air station noaa 2017d were also obtained from noaa the rain gauge water table wind and tide gauge stations along with the airports are shown in fig 1 all of the raw data together consisted of more than 15 million observations to keep the time series data organized a simplified version of the consortium of universities for the advancement of hydrologic sciences incorporated cuahsi observations data model horsburgh et al 2009 was implemented in a sqlite database the target data used for the model training and evaluation were the number of crowd sourced flooded location reports per storm event from september 2010 to october 2016 the flood reports were made and catalogued using the city s custom system to track organize record and map storm storm is used by the city to record and catalogue impacts from storms on the city s infrastructure e g downed powerlines damaged trees and storm data are viewable online at http gisapp1 norfolk gov stormmap for most of the study period only city of norfolk staff were able to make reports in storm however in the spring of 2016 the mobile application used for reporting was made available to the public reports made by the general public underwent an approval process by city staff the two categories of storm reports used for model training in this study were flooded street and flooded underpass a total of 45 storm events listed in table 1 were reported to have caused at least one flooded street or flooded underpass in the period of record the number of reported floods per event ranged from 1 to 159 fig 2 shows a box plot of the street flood reports per event eight of the events were hurricanes the rest were unnamed or given generic names by city workers the number of flood reports made from the top six storm events were much larger than the number of reports made from the other 39 storm events these larger events are marked as points and labeled in fig 2 2 3 model alternatives 2 3 1 poisson regression poisson regression is a generalized linear model glm commonly used to model rare event count data applications of poisson regression include modeling crime rate osgood 2000 disease incidence frome and checkoway 1985 and manufacturing defects lambert 1992 morrison and smith 2002 and viglione et al 2014 used poisson distributions to model the arrival time and occurrence of flood peaks respectively there are two main assumptions made when using poisson regression the first is that the response variable number of flood reports in this case follows a poisson distribution 1 p e λ λ k k where p is the probability that k number of events will occur per interval of time and λ is the event rate the second major assumption when using poisson regression is that the variance and the mean of the response variable are equal thus the probability distribution eq 1 can be specified by only one parameter λ coxe et al 2009 in poisson regression the mean parameter λ is defined by the log linear function 2 λ e x i β where x i is a vector of input values for time i and β is a corresponding vector of model parameters which is optimized during training cameron and trivedi 1998 2 3 2 random forest random forest developed by breiman 2001 is an ensemble machine learning algorithm which uses a large number of classification or regression trees cart to make a prediction breiman et al 1984 the response variable in this case the number of flood reports per event is modeled using regression therefore the random forest model is an ensemble of regression trees in the training of a regression tree rules based on the response variable are developed to divide observations until the resulting predictions have a minimum amount of node impurity node impurity for regression trees as defined by breiman et al 1984 is the sum of the squared deviations between the predicted and actual value loh 2011 the regression tree s rules are a collection of linear divisions of the observation data that together create a non linear decision surface one of the main problems of regression trees is that they are prone to overfitting to the training data and thus perform poorly when given unseen data murphy 2012 random forest is an approach that attempts to address this weakness when an individual regression tree is trained in the random forest algorithm a portion of the input records and predictor variables are randomly selected as input to the training this process is repeated for the number of regression trees specified by the modeler thus creating a group of regression trees each trained on a randomly selected subset of the records and input variables this group of regression trees constitutes a random forest model the prediction made by a random forest regression model is the average of the predictions made by each individual regression tree the random selection of input records and variables in the training of the individual regression trees creates variety in the weak learners thus avoiding overfitting of the model to the training data beyond the actual predictive capabilities of random forest the algorithm can be used to understand variable importance because many regression trees are being produced with different sets of input variables the random forest algorithm learns and records the relative importance of the input variables in predicting the output this capability is especially attractive as one of the objectives of this study is to understand the relative importance of explanatory variables in predicting street flooding such understanding could be used to direct future investments in improving observational networks within the city 3 methods 3 1 input data pre processing all of the raw input environmental data were aggregated to match the time scale of the flood reports for all of the days on which no flood reports were made and for storm events resulting in flood reports made only on one day the data were aggregated to a daily time scale for the storm events whose flood reports spanned multiple days the data were aggregated across the days so that each storm event had only one set of average environmental conditions for example flood reports labeled hurricane sandy were recorded over three days 27 29 oct 2012 the higher high tide taken for this event was the highest of the higher high tides of these three days the average level of the surficial groundwater table was the average over these three days and the total cumulative rainfall was the accumulated rainfall from the three days the resulting dataset consisted of 2171 records of average environmental conditions mostly at a daily time scale from september 2010 through october 2016 the aggregated environmental input variables are shown in table 2 different approaches of aggregation were taken for the various environmental variables four derivatives of the raw hrsd 15 min rainfall data were included in the models as inputs total cumulative rainfall maximum hourly rainfall maximum 15 min rainfall and cumulative rainfall in the previous three days the different derivatives of the rainfall data were included to account for different types of storm events that may cause flooding for example during convective thunderstorms in the summertime the maximum 15 min rainfall would be high but the total cumulative rainfall may be low for nor easters the cumulative rainfall would be high while the maximum 15 min rainfall may be low as with the 15 min rainfall data several tide related variables were model inputs including high and low tides and average tide level in coastal cities such as norfolk the timing of rainfall and the tide levels can have an effect on flooding for example if tide level is especially high when a large amount of rain falls the stormwater outlets may be submerged such tailwater conditions do not provide sufficient head difference for gravity driven storm drainage systems to function properly resulting in more flooding than if the tide were low and the same amount of rain fell to account for such interactions between tide and rainfall the tide level at the time of the maximum 15 min rainfall and the tide level at the time of the maximum hourly rainfall were included as model inputs the environmental conditions data were averaged across all the stations that recorded the variable for example the daily cumulative rainfall is the total cumulative rainfall averaged across all 11 rain gauges this spatial averaging was done because for some of the stations there was a considerable amount of missing data over the six years of the study period if the variables were not averaged across measuring stations it would appear that the stations that had less missing data were more important which would make it more difficult to understand the importance of the actual environmental variables compared to the consistency of measurements at an individual station to reduce noise in the data days on which little or no rainfall was recorded were not used in the modeling procedure of the 45 events for which flooding was reported 42 had an average cumulative rainfall total of 0 25 mm or greater of the three events with 0 25 mm of rainfall only one flooded location was reported for two of the events and only two flooded locations were reported for the third event given that very minor flooding was reported for days without rainfall days with little to no rainfall 0 25 mm of cumulative rainfall were not considered in the model training and evaluation this reduced the number of total records used to train and evaluate the model from 2171 to 814 3 2 model training and evaluation model training and evaluation were performed using two independent randomly selected partitions of the output and corresponding input data in some studies the dataset is split into three partitions a training evaluation and validation set tao et al 2017 however since a two way split is common in this field tien bui et al 2016 tehrany et al 2013 solomatine and xue 2004 and the available dataset is of limited volume the dataset was split into only two partitions in the model training the evaluation dataset was withheld and the models were fit to only the training data by withholding the evaluation dataset in model training the models can be evaluated using data not previously seen by the models thus simulating actual use of the predictive models the r programming language version 3 3 3 was used to partition the datasets train the two models and apply the models to the unseen evaluation dataset r core team 2017 the dataset of environmental conditions the model input data for storm events from september 2010 to october 2016 and the number of reported flood locations for each event the model output data were randomly divided into a training set 70 and an evaluation set 30 tien bui et al 2016 tehrany et al 2013 solomatine and xue 2004 using the caret package in r kuhn et al 2016 this package supports the stratified sampling of the datasets based on the distribution of the model output data which included the 42 storm events for which flooding was reported and the 772 events for which no flooding was reported by using stratified sampling the distribution of the number of reported floods the output variable in both the training and evaluation datasets was similar to the distribution of the number of reported floods of the entire data set to account for potential bias in the division of the data into training and evaluation sets the random division was made and the models were trained 100 times independently for both models since poisson regression is a parametric model the training of the poisson regression model consisted of optimizing the model coefficients the built in stats package in r was used for the poisson regression model the training of the random forest consisted of training each of the individual regression trees making up the random forest the randomforest package version 4 6 12 was used for the random forest model liaw and wiener 2002 the random forest model has two main parameters the number of trees per forest and the number of random predictor variables each tree uses a sensitivity study of these parameters was performed to determine their effect on model performance to determine the model sensitivity to the number of trees per forest the models were trained with the number of trees varying between 2 and 2000 with the default number of variables per tree i e one third of the variables or six in this case the tunerf function in the randomforest package was used to determine the optimum number of variables per regression tree in the random forest this function changes the number of variables used in each regression tree to find the number of variables that minimizes the out of bag error within the random forest the out of bag error is the prediction error when each input record is applied only to the portion of the regression trees which did not contain that input record in its training sample breiman 2001 only the training data was used to determine the appropriate number of trees and variables per tree xu et al 2017 once trained both the input training dataset and the input evaluation dataset were used as input for the models applying the models to the input data produced a predicted number of reported floods for each array of input values the predicted numbers of reported floods were compared with the known number of reported floods root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae between the known and predicted number of flood reports were the two main metrics used to evaluate the models since each model was trained 100 times once for each of the 100 random divisions into training and evaluation data a distribution of predicted number of flood reports was produced in the model evaluation for each known number of reported floods to describe these distributions their standard deviations std were plotted and the average standard deviation of each model was reported in addition to rmse mae and std the models false negative and false positive predictions were also used to evaluate the models false negative predictions occur when the predicted number flood reports is zero and the true number of flood reports is non zero false positive predictions occur when the true number of flood reports is zero and the predicted number of flood reports is non zero these terms are sometimes referred to as type i and type ii errors respectively beguería 2006 false negative and false positive predictions are of particular interest to a decision maker false negative predictions may jeopardize human safety and incur higher costs in recovery when a true positive prediction would have led to less costly preventative measures false positive predictions over time can erode trust in the warnings basha et al 2008 for the random forest and poisson regression models statistical characteristics e g count mean standard deviation of the false negative and false positive predictions were reported and compared since predictions were on a continuous scale and true flood reports were integers the predictions were rounded to the nearest integer when calculating the false negative and false positive rates for example a prediction was considered false positive when the number of predicted flood reports was at least 0 5 which would round to 1 and the true number of flood reports was zero 4 results and discussion 4 1 model results the results of the poisson regression training and evaluation are shown in table 3 and fig 3 predictions from the poisson regression 159 flood reports the largest number of flood locations reported from any one event were assumed to be outside a reasonable range and were therefore omitted these predictions accounted for 0 3 of all predictions and 5 9 of the predictions 0 5 flood report made in the evaluation phase on the other hand since the random forest model predictions are the average of each regression tree s prediction the random forest predictions cannot exceed the range of training values therefore none of the random forest predictions were omitted fig 3 shows the predictions made by the poisson regression model in the training and evaluation phases the predictions made using the training data as input generally follow the one to one line while the predictions made using the unseen evaluation data as input are much more scattered additionally for many of the values of true floods the predicted number of floods in the evaluation phase had large standard deviations mean of 18 42 flood reports compared to the training phase mean of 4 99 flood reports for some values of true flood reports in the evaluation phase the range of predictions was large even when the mean of the predictions was close to the true value for example the mean of the predictions when there were 31 true flood reports was 29 however the predictions ranged from 4 to 91 one explanation for the limited performance of the poisson regression may be due to the target data not conforming to the assumptions used in the development of the poisson regression model one of the primary assumptions when using poisson regression is that the variance and the mean of the output dataset are equal in the flood reports dataset described in section 2 2 and fig 2 the mean was 1 2 flood reports much lower than the variance 108 flood reports meaning that the data were overdispersed a common method for handling overdispersed data in such cases is to use a modified version of poisson regression called overdispersed poisson with overdispersed poisson the assumption that the mean is equal to the variance is relaxed gardner et al 1995 the overdispersed poisson was tested as well but the results were very similar to the poisson regression results the results of the sensitivity analysis of the random forest parameters led to adjusting both the number of trees per forest and the number of predictive variables per regression tree from their defaults based on the analysis the number of trees per forest was changed to be 100 as seen in fig 4 random forests with more than 100 regression trees saw minimal improvements in terms of rmse mae and std the model performance was more sensitive to the number of predictive variables per tree through the tunerf procedure the optimum number of variables per regression tree that performed was found to be 16 changing the number of variables per tree from six the default to 16 decreased the models rmse by 23 the rmse mae and std of training and evaluation predictions from the random forest model are reported in table 3 the rmse was significantly higher in the evaluation phase compared to the training phase both when considering all of the events and when considering only events where floods were recorded in both cases the evaluation rmse was about two times the training rmse suggesting that like the poisson regression the model was overfit to the training data fig 5 shows the predicted number of flood reports made by the random forest model in the training and evaluation phases one reason for the overfitting seen in the models may be related to the imbalance of dataset as would be expected there are far more storm events where no flooding is reported making the dataset imbalanced the ratio of storm events for which some rain fell and zero flood reports were made to storm events on which some rain fell and at least one flood report was made is approximately 18 1 another factor may be the relatively small nature of the dataset 1000 total records he and garcia 2009 noted that models trained with datasets that are both imbalanced and small are particularly prone to overfitting to the training data as more data is collected and available for use in model training it is expected that model overfitting would decrease compared to the poisson regression the random forest model random forest performed better overall in terms of rmse and mae both models were nearly equal in the training phase however random forest performed significantly better in the evaluation phase while both models showed signs of being overfit to the training data i e a large drop in performance during the evaluation phase the proportional difference in performance between training and evaluation in the random forest predictions was roughly two thirds of that of the poisson regression a more significant difference in performance between poisson regression and random forest was seen in the stability of the predictions in the evaluation phase as measured by the standard deviations of the predictions quantitatively in the evaluation phase the standard deviations of the poisson predictions was more than three times that of the standard deviation of the random forest predictions visually the difference is apparent when comparing the standard deviation bars in the evaluation predictions in figs 3 and 5 it is important to note that model performance was measured using observed environmental conditions as model input in practice forecasted environmental conditions would be used as model input to predict flood severity for example rather than using rainfall and tide data observed at monitoring stations as input rainfall forecasts from the high resolution rapid refresh hrrr model smith et al 2008 and noaa s tide predictions noaa 2017e could be used as inputs the use of uncertain forecast rainfall data are expected to increase the overall uncertainty of the model collier 2007 bartholmes and todini 2005 4 2 false negative and false positive predictions statistics summarizing false negative and false positive predictions in the evaluation phase are given in table 4 poisson regression had fewer but more variable and extreme false positive predictions compared to random forest the false positive rate for poisson regression was 4 39 compared to 7 09 for random forest however the standard deviation of the false positive predictions was much larger from the poisson regression 8 55 flood reports compared to 3 18 flood reports for both models most of the false positive predictions were 1 17 flood reports which would round down to one the maximum false positive prediction was much greater in the poisson regression compared to the random forest 122 compared to 36 compared to the false positive rates both poisson regression and random forest had much higher false negative rates 45 92 and 34 46 respectively importantly compared to random forest poisson regression predicted false negatives when true flood reports were higher on average mean of 6 flood reports compared to 3 flood reports as with the false positives the standard deviation of the false negatives predictions was higher for poisson regression versus random forest 11 55 flood reports compared to 2 30 flood reports similarly the maximum true number of flood reports when a false negative prediction was made was much higher from poisson regression 101 flood reports compared to 9 4 2 1 variable importance fig 6 shows the importance of each of the input variables as calculated from the random forest model in terms of the percent increase in mean squared error mse when each of the variables is permuted individually the total cumulative rainfall value was by far the most important of the variables this was much more important than any of the other variables derived from the raw rainfall data including the maximum hourly and maximum 15 min rainfall values suggesting that in this record large rainfall volumes caused more flooding than high rainfall intensities the next three variables in terms of prediction importance were related to tide low tide lower low tide and higher high tide the variable importance results shown in fig 6 are supported by the raw data shown in fig 7 the number of flood reports has clear positive relationship with the total cumulative rainfall the same is true for low tide and lower low tide the relationship is less clear for the maximum hourly rainfall and the maximum 15 min rainfall but according to fig 6 the random forest model was still able to glean some meaningful information from these variables interestingly the tide level during the maximum 15 min rainfall has a clearer visual relationship with the number of flood reports compared to the maximum hourly and maximum 15 min rainfall values but is considered less important by the random forest algorithm one explanation for this may be that the information provided by the tide level during the maximum 15 min rainfall is already provided to the model perhaps in a more useful form from the low tide lower low tide and higher high tide variables the average height of the water table during a given event surprisingly did not add appreciable predictive power to the model this may suggest that the surficial groundwater table did not impact flood severity in a significant way however the fact that it did not provide predictive power does not necessarily mean that the surficial groundwater table level did not contribute to flooding for example since the infiltration of rainfall causes the surficial groundwater table to rise it is possible that the information provided by the rainfall data provides similar but clearer predictive power to the model compared to the surficial groundwater table level although total cumulative rainfall is clearly the dominant predictor of flood severity in this dataset it is commonly understood that other factors can have a significant impact on flooding in a coastal environment for example high tides alone can cause flooding in coastal cites marfai et al 2008 when tidal information is omitted from the model inputs in this study the rmse of the random forest predictions increases by 4 and by 14 for the poisson regression predictions thus while rainfall is clearly the most important variable tide levels and potentially other environmental variables cannot be ignored it is anticipated that as sea levels rise the importance of tide levels and water table level in predicting coastal flooding will grow hoover et al 2016 4 3 potential explanations for model limitations a likely reason for the limited performance in both models is the limited amount of reported street floods used to train the models the crowd sourced flood report dataset used in this study is a unique and valuable dataset but still a complete picture of flooding impacts is missing flood reports were made on only 42 or just over 5 of the records used in the modeling in addition the number of flooding reports were distributed very unequally among the 42 storm events on which flood reports were made more than 65 of the total flood reports were recorded from just six storm events 0 6 of the total storm events modeled the rarity of storm events with any flood reports and especially a large number of flood reports makes it difficult to train robust data driven models solomatine and xue 2004 faced similar problems in training their machine learning model to accurately predict high peak flows which occurred rarely in their dataset the results also suggest that compared to storm events with large volumes of rainfall which caused flooding other types of storm events were not as well modeled fig 8 shows the percent error of the random forest evaluation predictions for the 11 events with the top 10 number of reported floods two events had 101 flood reports hurricane nicole and an unnamed event occurring on 20 september 2016 two unnamed events heavy rain which occurred on 16 may 2014 35 reported flood locations and thunderstorms which occurred on 10 july 2014 39 reported flood locations have average percent error magnitudes larger than the rest both of these events had much lower cumulative rainfall and tide levels the most important variables in the model see fig 6 but higher maximum hourly rainfall and relatively high maximum 15 min rainfall values compared to the other high flooding events given this it is possible that these events caused flash floods the worse performance of the models at predicting the flooding severity from these two events may suggest that this type of flooding is not well represented in the training dataset it is expected that the data driven models would better predict such flood events with a larger more complete dataset containing more instances of similar flooding events additionally with more training data the models could be trained on specific subsets of flood events tailoring it to a type of flood event with specific characteristics e g flash floods besides the limited number of flooding events with which to train the models bias present in the training data could have hampered model performance because the flooded locations were reported by individuals there is an unknown amount of subjectivity and bias in the data as can be expected when using crowd sourced data since the models are trained on data reported by individuals one individual may influence the trained model disproportionally fig 9 shows the total number of flood reports made by each individual reporter and the number of flood events for which each reporter recorded at least one flooded location during the period of record the highest number of total reports made by one reporter was 158 14 of the sum total reports from all 71 reporters therefore the models in their training are significantly influenced by this one reporter and can inherit to some extent his her biases another potential bias is in the under or over representation of different roadway types in the flooding record fig 10 shows the percentage of roadway length per vdot roadway class in norfolk and the percent of each roadway class at which flood reports were made table 5 gives the descriptions for each of the classes from the figure it is seen that although public local streets class 6 account for the majority of the roadway length of the city close to 60 only 40 of the flooded streets reported were of this class conversely principal arterials class 3 accounted for nearly 30 of the flooded street reports even though these streets make up 10 of norfolk s total roadway length this suggests that a flooded street less traveled and therefore less important to the overall connectivity of the city s street network may have flooded but may not have been reported within the record with the same frequency as the more major roads a third example of bias may occur when unequal attention in reporting is given to certain geographic areas of the city or to certain storm events one example of this bias is seen in the difference in reported floods between hurricane hermine and hurricane matthew which occurred only one month apart for hurricane hermine 22 flood reports more than half of the total of 40 flood reports made as a result of hurricane hermine came from one area in downtown norfolk in contrast for hurricane matthew which produced more than three times as much total cumulative rainfall on average than hurricane hermine 264 mm compared to 84 mm and was at least comparable in terms of tide water table height and wind conditions only six flood reports were made from the same area it is unlikely that the actual flooding caused by hurricane matthew a much larger storm was in fact a quarter in severity but more likely that there were significant differences in reporting between the two events 4 4 increase in street flood reports flooding reports and events have become more frequent over the period of record september 2010 to october 2016 the number of flooded street reports has increased year to year in the past four years and overall in the past seven years see fig 11 more than twice as many floods were reported in 2016 compared to 2014 very few flood reports were made in 2013 compared to the other years of record this can be explained at least in part because 2013 was an exceptionally mild hurricane season the first since 1994 without any major hurricanes the only storm event in 2013 reported to have caused flooding was an unnamed heavy rain event the overall increase in the number of flood reports over the period of record was due primarily to an increase in the number of storm events from which flood reports were made rather than an increase in the number of reports per storm event in the years 2010 2013 five total storm events were reported to have caused flooding while in 2014 alone 16 events were reported to have caused flooding and at least 10 storm events per year resulted in reports of flooded streets in 2015 and 2016 see fig 11 in contrast to the storm events reported in 2010 2013 most of the storm events reported to have caused flooding in the years 2014 2016 were smaller unnamed storm events in each of the years 2010 2011 and 2012 there was a storm event for which more than 100 flood reports were made each of them named major hurricanes nicole irene and sandy respectively in 2014 on the other hand of the 16 storm events reported to have caused flooding the maximum number of flood reports for an individual storm event was 39 and only one named hurricane was reported to have caused flooding hurricane arthur the increase in flood reports due to smaller storms from 2014 to 2016 may suggest that the city of norfolk is becoming more susceptible to flooding from less extreme storm events i e storm events which are not hurricanes it is noted that most of the flood reports were made by staff of the city which operates with limited resources in reality the number of flood locations resulting from the recorded storm events could be larger than what was reported including street floods that may have occurred from less extreme events in 2010 2013 it is also possible that the increase in flood reports over the period of record may simply be due to an increase in attention given to street flooding and resources to street flood reporting in norfolk rather than an increase in actual flooding an increase in attention and resources allocated to street flooding and street flood reporting from the city of norfolk however may still suggest that flooding problems are worsening sweet and park 2014 noted an increase of nuisance level tidal flooding in norfolk va from 1 2 days per year in the years 1956 1960 to 7 4 days per year in the years 2006 2010 sweet and park 2014 also predicted that the amount of flooding will increase with time due to predicted sea level rise this is in agreement with the increase of flood reports seen in the present study as sea level rises and climate changes it may be necessary to incorporate a mechanism to account for this change into data driven predictive models this change be referred to as concept drift gama et al 2014 gama and castillo 2006 and mechanisms for accounting for it would be especially useful when using random forest which as noted above cannot exceed the range of training data 5 conclusions two data driven models poisson regression and random forest were trained to predict flood severity for a given set of environmental conditions rainfall tide levels groundwater levels and wind conditions using quality controlled crowd sourced street flooding reports as a proxy output variable the data used for training and evaluating the models was from norfolk virginia usa the random forest model performed better overall compared to poisson regression in the evaluation phase root mean squared error of 3 87 compared to 6 71 flood reports mean absolute error of 0 69 compared to 0 96 flood reports with less variance standard deviation of 6 00 compared to 18 42 flood reports the most important variable in predicting model output in the random forest model was by far total cumulative rainfall followed by low tide and lower low tide it is important to note that the flood report data was available only on a daily time step and the analysis was completed for flood events which sometimes stretched over a multi day period variable importantance may change if flood report data were available at a hourly or subhourly resolution and used in the analysis the quality controlled crowd sourced flood data provided by the city of norfolk despite limited spatial and temporal coverage provided an uncommonly detailed flood record in the record flooding at individual intersections and streets was recorded for many events over an extended period of time using this as training data the models demonstrated in this paper could give city workers a reasonable estimate of flooding severity across the study region based on forecasted environmental conditions this is a first step in the long term goal of spatially and temporally detailed urban flood predictions to assist city managers in real time flood adaptation measures such as traffic management this also demonstrates one way that crowd sourced data despite its limitations can provide useful information to flood prediction models a main limiting factor in building accurate models is the quantity and quality of the record of flooding used to train the model given the bias present in the training dataset due in part to a limited number of flood reports predictions were necessarily lumped spatially predictions were made at the city scale and temporally predictions were made at a event time scale while other work has raised the need for accurate and dense measurements of rainfall sadler et al 2017 hill et al 2014 the primary input to flood models the results of this work highlight the need for more accurate and complete record of flooding data including depth and duration of flood occurrences such data is needed to adequately train flood models with enough spatial and temporal detail to help make street level real time operational decisions given more complete and objective flood occurrence data it is likely that a data driven model such as the ones demonstrated in this paper could predict street flooding with much greater precision the need for a more complete flood record data may be filled with a street level sensor network eliminating human subjectivity and providing higher temporal resolution of street flooding events such a sensor network is currently being piloted to record water levels at frequently flooded intersections in norfolk the detailed data from this network could be used to further improve predictions from models such as those demonstrated in this paper crowd sourced data such as flood reports made by citizens from smart phone apps could also be useful although the subjectivity in publicly crowd sourced data would likely be similar to the dataset used in the paper a wider number of reporters could help to mitigate subjectivity and result in a more complete understanding of the spatial and temporal extent of road flooding occurrences data availability in an effort to make this study reproducible all data and computational

7368,sea level rise has already caused more frequent and severe coastal flooding and this trend will likely continue flood prediction is an essential part of a coastal city s capacity to adapt to and mitigate this growing problem complex coastal urban hydrological systems however do not always lend themselves easily to physically based flood prediction approaches this paper presents a method for using a data driven approach to estimate flood severity in an urban coastal setting using crowd sourced data a non traditional but growing data source along with environmental observation data two data driven models poisson regression and random forest regression are trained to predict the number of flood reports per storm event as a proxy for flood severity given extensive environmental data i e rainfall tide groundwater table level and wind conditions as input the method is demonstrated using data from norfolk virginia usa from september 2010 to october 2016 quality controlled crowd sourced street flooding reports ranging from 1 to 159 per storm event for 45 storm events are used to train and evaluate the models random forest performed better than poisson regression at predicting the number of flood reports and had a lower false negative rate from the random forest model total cumulative rainfall was by far the most dominant input variable in predicting flood severity followed by low tide and lower low tide these methods serve as a first step toward using data driven methods for spatially and temporally detailed coastal urban flood prediction keywords flood modeling data driven models urban hydrology coastal flooding 1 introduction flooding in low lying coastal cities has become more common in recent years due to climate change and relative sea level rise sweet and park 2014 in the coming decades relative sea level is expected to rise substantially vermeer and rahmstorf 2009 church et al 2001 which will worsen the problem of flooding in coastal cities flooding in coastal cities is caused by large life threatening high return period events such as hurricanes harvey and irma whose flooding recently affected coastal cities in texas and florida usa respectively additionally many coastal cities have low relief terrain and low elevation making stormwater drainage problematic this can make coastal cities susceptible to flooding from smaller low return period events such as severe thunderstorms the long term effects of legacy engineering decisions can further add to an urban city s flood risk e g the use of non engineered fill used to reclaim streams which causes higher than average subsidence rates turner 2004 the ability to accurately predict flooding allows decision makers to proactively mitigate the effects of flooding zevenbergen et al 2008 which is key to a city s resilience to natural hazards godschalk 2003 accurate flood prediction allows decision makers to maximize safety in the case of large events and minimize infrastructure damage and social and economic disruption in the case of smaller events accurate flood prediction also allows cyber physical or smart stormwater systems to perform optimally further mitigating the effects of flooding kerkez et al 2016 modeling and predicting flooding in urban coastal environments can be challenging urban coastal floods are influenced by a combination of different environmental geographic and human related factors gallien et al 2014 environmental factors that contribute to coastal flooding include rainfall wind tide levels and ground water table levels geographic factors such as elevation soil properties proximity to the coast and the land use and land cover of the drainage area can influence whether a given location experiences flooding in urban settings human related factors including built stormwater infrastructure which is often underground and the condition of that infrastructure also play a role in the location and severity of flooding for example clogged stormwater inlets and undersized stormwater pipes can increase the chance and severity of flooding high tidal levels can inundate stormwater outfalls rendering them ineffective at draining stormwater to the ocean a condition which will become more frequent with sea level rise the need to accurately represent such systems and their changing conditions further adds to the complexity of urban flood modeling urban coastal flood events can be modeled using physically based 1d mark et al 2004 or 2d models mignot et al 2006 hunter et al 2008 bates et al 2005 smith et al 2011 gallien et al 2014 however the simplified representations of reality used in physically based models can be a limitation given the combination of variables and their interactions and the complexity of the physical environment two dimensional hydrodynamic models make fewer simplifications compared to 1d models however this comes at a larger computational cost leandro et al 2009 which makes executing and especially calibrating a 2d model difficult caviedes voullième et al 2012 another modeling approach shown to be effective in many fields yang et al 2017a including hydrology solomatine and ostfeld 2008 is data driven modeling data driven models detect patterns in the data to map model inputs to model outputs without attempting to simulate the physical processes solomatine and ostfeld 2008 thus the relationship between the inputs and outputs is not assumed as in physically based models but learned while physical processes are not directly simulated using data driven models understanding of physical processes usually influences the selection of input variables used to predict the output variable booker and woods 2014 the recent increase in availability of earth observation data coupled with advances in machine learning algorithms have expanded the possibilities and use of data driven modeling in hydrology machine learning algorithms have been used extensively in hydrology for applications such as predicting reservoir operations yang et al 2016 soil mineral weathering povak et al 2014 streamflow yang et al 2017b solomatine and xue 2004 wang et al 2009 groundwater potential naghibi et al 2017 and groundwater level sahoo et al 2017 data driven and machine learning algorithms in flooding applications specifically have been used by tehrany et al 2013 wang et al 2015 and tien bui et al 2016 who predicted areas susceptible to flooding adamovic et al 2016 who modeled flash flooding on a regional scale and solomatine and xue 2004 who predicted streamflow for flood forecasting despite the expanded use of data driven models in hydrology few studies have used data driven methods to model flooding within coastal urban environments the closest work may be the statistical analysis of tidal records in the united states to estimate the amount of time that coastal cities have experienced flooding in the past several decades and project flooding in the coming decades ezer and atkinson 2014 sweet and park 2014 moftakhari et al 2015 ray and foster 2016 the objective of this study is to use data driven modeling to predict flooding severity for a given storm in an urban coastal setting crowd sourced flood reports recorded during flood events are used for model training and are considered a proxy variable for flood severity although a more objective measure of flood severity is preferred to the number of flood reports e g flood inundation depth and duration throughout the study domain often such data is not available relevant environmental data rainfall tide levels water table level wind speed and direction will be used as inputs to the model a data driven approach is appropriate for this application due to the complexity of modeling urban coastal flooding as discussed above which makes using a physical model difficult this paper will investigate and compare two different data driven models poisson regression and random forest regression poisson regression is a generalized linear model and was selected because it is commonly used to model rare events d unger et al 1998 and a flood report while increasing in occurrence can still be considered a rare event random forest was selected due to its wide use as a machine learning algorithm in hydrology applications yang et al 2016 wang et al 2015 loos and elsenbeer 2011 and other fields e g mutanga et al 2012 svetnik et al 2003 the data driven approach will be applied in norfolk virginia usa norfolk and the surrounding hampton roads region is one of the most vulnerable metropolitan centers to coastal flooding in the usa fears 2012 since 2010 the city has collected quality controlled crowd sourced street flooding reports for 45 storm events in this study the two data driven models poisson regression and random forest regression will be trained to predict the number of street flood reports per storm event given the rainfall tidal water table and wind characteristics of the storm event the models will be evaluated and compared using primarily the root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae between the predicted number of street flood reports and the actual number of street flood reports this is a first step toward the use of data driven approaches in urban coastal flood modeling additionally although gaitan et al 2016 employed exploratory methods to glean information from open spatial data weather data and user reports the use of crowd sourced data in the training and evaluation of data driven predictive models for urban flood modeling has not been demonstrated or discussed thoroughly in the literature this is relevant currently as multiple platforms now exist for collecting crowd sourced information regarding urban flooding le coz et al 2016 and it can be expected that due to the nearly universal use of internet connected devices crowd sourced data will continue to grow in volume the results of the modeling also shed light on the relative importance of different environmental factors in predicting coastal flooding another subject that has been given little attention in previous literature regarding urban coastal flooding the remainder of this paper will proceed as follows first background will be given describing the study area the model input and output data and an introduction to the data driven models used next the methods are presented describing the preparation of the data for the models and how the data driven models were applied and evaluated the model results are then presented and discussed and finally conclusions are given 2 study area data and model background 2 1 study area and street flooding record norfolk virginia usa shown in fig 1 is an ideal study area for this research considering its vulnerability to flooding its economic and military importance and the availability of quality controlled crowd sourced data regarding flood occurrences for the city norfolk is one of the most vulnerable cities to coastal flooding in the usa due largely to land subsidence rates causing norfolk and the surrounding area to experience relative sea level rise at a rate faster than the global average kleinosky et al 2006 as home to the largest terminal of the port of virginia the 3rd most used port on the east coast of the us the port of virginia 2016 norfolk plays an important role in the economy of virginia and the surrounding states the world s largest naval base naval station norfolk is also within norfolk making the flooding risks in the area important to us national security broder 2009 an important factor in selecting the study area was the availability of crowd sourced flood report data a record of reported flooded street locations has been kept in norfolk starting with hurricane nicole on 30 september 2010 shown in fig 1 this is a unique dataset because often observational data from flooding events is a limiting factor in creating useful flood models smith et al 2011 because such data is often sparse photographs of flooded locations and personal interviews have been used out of necessity in the calibration and verification of flood models smith et al 2011 even satellite imagery has been used to estimate flooding extents ireland et al 2015 but is less useful as a street scale flood record in an urban setting due to its coarse spatial resolution 2 2 description of model input and output data the objective of this study is to develop a model capable of predicting flooding severity resulting from a given storm event based on the environmental conditions of that event the environmental condition input data for the model consisted of rainfall water table level wind and tide level observations these were obtained from the hampton roads sanitation district hrsd and the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa from hrsd rainfall water table elevation wind direction and wind speed data were obtained the rainfall observations were on a 15 min time scale and the water table elevations and wind data were on a 2 min time scale from noaa 6 min water elevations and daily high and low tides recorded at the sewells point noaa 2017a and money point noaa 2017b tide gauges were obtained wind speed wind gust and wind direction data recorded at the money point station at 6 min time intervals were used as well daily rainfall and wind data collected at two airports in the study area norfolk international airport noaa 2017c and norfolk naval air station noaa 2017d were also obtained from noaa the rain gauge water table wind and tide gauge stations along with the airports are shown in fig 1 all of the raw data together consisted of more than 15 million observations to keep the time series data organized a simplified version of the consortium of universities for the advancement of hydrologic sciences incorporated cuahsi observations data model horsburgh et al 2009 was implemented in a sqlite database the target data used for the model training and evaluation were the number of crowd sourced flooded location reports per storm event from september 2010 to october 2016 the flood reports were made and catalogued using the city s custom system to track organize record and map storm storm is used by the city to record and catalogue impacts from storms on the city s infrastructure e g downed powerlines damaged trees and storm data are viewable online at http gisapp1 norfolk gov stormmap for most of the study period only city of norfolk staff were able to make reports in storm however in the spring of 2016 the mobile application used for reporting was made available to the public reports made by the general public underwent an approval process by city staff the two categories of storm reports used for model training in this study were flooded street and flooded underpass a total of 45 storm events listed in table 1 were reported to have caused at least one flooded street or flooded underpass in the period of record the number of reported floods per event ranged from 1 to 159 fig 2 shows a box plot of the street flood reports per event eight of the events were hurricanes the rest were unnamed or given generic names by city workers the number of flood reports made from the top six storm events were much larger than the number of reports made from the other 39 storm events these larger events are marked as points and labeled in fig 2 2 3 model alternatives 2 3 1 poisson regression poisson regression is a generalized linear model glm commonly used to model rare event count data applications of poisson regression include modeling crime rate osgood 2000 disease incidence frome and checkoway 1985 and manufacturing defects lambert 1992 morrison and smith 2002 and viglione et al 2014 used poisson distributions to model the arrival time and occurrence of flood peaks respectively there are two main assumptions made when using poisson regression the first is that the response variable number of flood reports in this case follows a poisson distribution 1 p e λ λ k k where p is the probability that k number of events will occur per interval of time and λ is the event rate the second major assumption when using poisson regression is that the variance and the mean of the response variable are equal thus the probability distribution eq 1 can be specified by only one parameter λ coxe et al 2009 in poisson regression the mean parameter λ is defined by the log linear function 2 λ e x i β where x i is a vector of input values for time i and β is a corresponding vector of model parameters which is optimized during training cameron and trivedi 1998 2 3 2 random forest random forest developed by breiman 2001 is an ensemble machine learning algorithm which uses a large number of classification or regression trees cart to make a prediction breiman et al 1984 the response variable in this case the number of flood reports per event is modeled using regression therefore the random forest model is an ensemble of regression trees in the training of a regression tree rules based on the response variable are developed to divide observations until the resulting predictions have a minimum amount of node impurity node impurity for regression trees as defined by breiman et al 1984 is the sum of the squared deviations between the predicted and actual value loh 2011 the regression tree s rules are a collection of linear divisions of the observation data that together create a non linear decision surface one of the main problems of regression trees is that they are prone to overfitting to the training data and thus perform poorly when given unseen data murphy 2012 random forest is an approach that attempts to address this weakness when an individual regression tree is trained in the random forest algorithm a portion of the input records and predictor variables are randomly selected as input to the training this process is repeated for the number of regression trees specified by the modeler thus creating a group of regression trees each trained on a randomly selected subset of the records and input variables this group of regression trees constitutes a random forest model the prediction made by a random forest regression model is the average of the predictions made by each individual regression tree the random selection of input records and variables in the training of the individual regression trees creates variety in the weak learners thus avoiding overfitting of the model to the training data beyond the actual predictive capabilities of random forest the algorithm can be used to understand variable importance because many regression trees are being produced with different sets of input variables the random forest algorithm learns and records the relative importance of the input variables in predicting the output this capability is especially attractive as one of the objectives of this study is to understand the relative importance of explanatory variables in predicting street flooding such understanding could be used to direct future investments in improving observational networks within the city 3 methods 3 1 input data pre processing all of the raw input environmental data were aggregated to match the time scale of the flood reports for all of the days on which no flood reports were made and for storm events resulting in flood reports made only on one day the data were aggregated to a daily time scale for the storm events whose flood reports spanned multiple days the data were aggregated across the days so that each storm event had only one set of average environmental conditions for example flood reports labeled hurricane sandy were recorded over three days 27 29 oct 2012 the higher high tide taken for this event was the highest of the higher high tides of these three days the average level of the surficial groundwater table was the average over these three days and the total cumulative rainfall was the accumulated rainfall from the three days the resulting dataset consisted of 2171 records of average environmental conditions mostly at a daily time scale from september 2010 through october 2016 the aggregated environmental input variables are shown in table 2 different approaches of aggregation were taken for the various environmental variables four derivatives of the raw hrsd 15 min rainfall data were included in the models as inputs total cumulative rainfall maximum hourly rainfall maximum 15 min rainfall and cumulative rainfall in the previous three days the different derivatives of the rainfall data were included to account for different types of storm events that may cause flooding for example during convective thunderstorms in the summertime the maximum 15 min rainfall would be high but the total cumulative rainfall may be low for nor easters the cumulative rainfall would be high while the maximum 15 min rainfall may be low as with the 15 min rainfall data several tide related variables were model inputs including high and low tides and average tide level in coastal cities such as norfolk the timing of rainfall and the tide levels can have an effect on flooding for example if tide level is especially high when a large amount of rain falls the stormwater outlets may be submerged such tailwater conditions do not provide sufficient head difference for gravity driven storm drainage systems to function properly resulting in more flooding than if the tide were low and the same amount of rain fell to account for such interactions between tide and rainfall the tide level at the time of the maximum 15 min rainfall and the tide level at the time of the maximum hourly rainfall were included as model inputs the environmental conditions data were averaged across all the stations that recorded the variable for example the daily cumulative rainfall is the total cumulative rainfall averaged across all 11 rain gauges this spatial averaging was done because for some of the stations there was a considerable amount of missing data over the six years of the study period if the variables were not averaged across measuring stations it would appear that the stations that had less missing data were more important which would make it more difficult to understand the importance of the actual environmental variables compared to the consistency of measurements at an individual station to reduce noise in the data days on which little or no rainfall was recorded were not used in the modeling procedure of the 45 events for which flooding was reported 42 had an average cumulative rainfall total of 0 25 mm or greater of the three events with 0 25 mm of rainfall only one flooded location was reported for two of the events and only two flooded locations were reported for the third event given that very minor flooding was reported for days without rainfall days with little to no rainfall 0 25 mm of cumulative rainfall were not considered in the model training and evaluation this reduced the number of total records used to train and evaluate the model from 2171 to 814 3 2 model training and evaluation model training and evaluation were performed using two independent randomly selected partitions of the output and corresponding input data in some studies the dataset is split into three partitions a training evaluation and validation set tao et al 2017 however since a two way split is common in this field tien bui et al 2016 tehrany et al 2013 solomatine and xue 2004 and the available dataset is of limited volume the dataset was split into only two partitions in the model training the evaluation dataset was withheld and the models were fit to only the training data by withholding the evaluation dataset in model training the models can be evaluated using data not previously seen by the models thus simulating actual use of the predictive models the r programming language version 3 3 3 was used to partition the datasets train the two models and apply the models to the unseen evaluation dataset r core team 2017 the dataset of environmental conditions the model input data for storm events from september 2010 to october 2016 and the number of reported flood locations for each event the model output data were randomly divided into a training set 70 and an evaluation set 30 tien bui et al 2016 tehrany et al 2013 solomatine and xue 2004 using the caret package in r kuhn et al 2016 this package supports the stratified sampling of the datasets based on the distribution of the model output data which included the 42 storm events for which flooding was reported and the 772 events for which no flooding was reported by using stratified sampling the distribution of the number of reported floods the output variable in both the training and evaluation datasets was similar to the distribution of the number of reported floods of the entire data set to account for potential bias in the division of the data into training and evaluation sets the random division was made and the models were trained 100 times independently for both models since poisson regression is a parametric model the training of the poisson regression model consisted of optimizing the model coefficients the built in stats package in r was used for the poisson regression model the training of the random forest consisted of training each of the individual regression trees making up the random forest the randomforest package version 4 6 12 was used for the random forest model liaw and wiener 2002 the random forest model has two main parameters the number of trees per forest and the number of random predictor variables each tree uses a sensitivity study of these parameters was performed to determine their effect on model performance to determine the model sensitivity to the number of trees per forest the models were trained with the number of trees varying between 2 and 2000 with the default number of variables per tree i e one third of the variables or six in this case the tunerf function in the randomforest package was used to determine the optimum number of variables per regression tree in the random forest this function changes the number of variables used in each regression tree to find the number of variables that minimizes the out of bag error within the random forest the out of bag error is the prediction error when each input record is applied only to the portion of the regression trees which did not contain that input record in its training sample breiman 2001 only the training data was used to determine the appropriate number of trees and variables per tree xu et al 2017 once trained both the input training dataset and the input evaluation dataset were used as input for the models applying the models to the input data produced a predicted number of reported floods for each array of input values the predicted numbers of reported floods were compared with the known number of reported floods root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae between the known and predicted number of flood reports were the two main metrics used to evaluate the models since each model was trained 100 times once for each of the 100 random divisions into training and evaluation data a distribution of predicted number of flood reports was produced in the model evaluation for each known number of reported floods to describe these distributions their standard deviations std were plotted and the average standard deviation of each model was reported in addition to rmse mae and std the models false negative and false positive predictions were also used to evaluate the models false negative predictions occur when the predicted number flood reports is zero and the true number of flood reports is non zero false positive predictions occur when the true number of flood reports is zero and the predicted number of flood reports is non zero these terms are sometimes referred to as type i and type ii errors respectively beguería 2006 false negative and false positive predictions are of particular interest to a decision maker false negative predictions may jeopardize human safety and incur higher costs in recovery when a true positive prediction would have led to less costly preventative measures false positive predictions over time can erode trust in the warnings basha et al 2008 for the random forest and poisson regression models statistical characteristics e g count mean standard deviation of the false negative and false positive predictions were reported and compared since predictions were on a continuous scale and true flood reports were integers the predictions were rounded to the nearest integer when calculating the false negative and false positive rates for example a prediction was considered false positive when the number of predicted flood reports was at least 0 5 which would round to 1 and the true number of flood reports was zero 4 results and discussion 4 1 model results the results of the poisson regression training and evaluation are shown in table 3 and fig 3 predictions from the poisson regression 159 flood reports the largest number of flood locations reported from any one event were assumed to be outside a reasonable range and were therefore omitted these predictions accounted for 0 3 of all predictions and 5 9 of the predictions 0 5 flood report made in the evaluation phase on the other hand since the random forest model predictions are the average of each regression tree s prediction the random forest predictions cannot exceed the range of training values therefore none of the random forest predictions were omitted fig 3 shows the predictions made by the poisson regression model in the training and evaluation phases the predictions made using the training data as input generally follow the one to one line while the predictions made using the unseen evaluation data as input are much more scattered additionally for many of the values of true floods the predicted number of floods in the evaluation phase had large standard deviations mean of 18 42 flood reports compared to the training phase mean of 4 99 flood reports for some values of true flood reports in the evaluation phase the range of predictions was large even when the mean of the predictions was close to the true value for example the mean of the predictions when there were 31 true flood reports was 29 however the predictions ranged from 4 to 91 one explanation for the limited performance of the poisson regression may be due to the target data not conforming to the assumptions used in the development of the poisson regression model one of the primary assumptions when using poisson regression is that the variance and the mean of the output dataset are equal in the flood reports dataset described in section 2 2 and fig 2 the mean was 1 2 flood reports much lower than the variance 108 flood reports meaning that the data were overdispersed a common method for handling overdispersed data in such cases is to use a modified version of poisson regression called overdispersed poisson with overdispersed poisson the assumption that the mean is equal to the variance is relaxed gardner et al 1995 the overdispersed poisson was tested as well but the results were very similar to the poisson regression results the results of the sensitivity analysis of the random forest parameters led to adjusting both the number of trees per forest and the number of predictive variables per regression tree from their defaults based on the analysis the number of trees per forest was changed to be 100 as seen in fig 4 random forests with more than 100 regression trees saw minimal improvements in terms of rmse mae and std the model performance was more sensitive to the number of predictive variables per tree through the tunerf procedure the optimum number of variables per regression tree that performed was found to be 16 changing the number of variables per tree from six the default to 16 decreased the models rmse by 23 the rmse mae and std of training and evaluation predictions from the random forest model are reported in table 3 the rmse was significantly higher in the evaluation phase compared to the training phase both when considering all of the events and when considering only events where floods were recorded in both cases the evaluation rmse was about two times the training rmse suggesting that like the poisson regression the model was overfit to the training data fig 5 shows the predicted number of flood reports made by the random forest model in the training and evaluation phases one reason for the overfitting seen in the models may be related to the imbalance of dataset as would be expected there are far more storm events where no flooding is reported making the dataset imbalanced the ratio of storm events for which some rain fell and zero flood reports were made to storm events on which some rain fell and at least one flood report was made is approximately 18 1 another factor may be the relatively small nature of the dataset 1000 total records he and garcia 2009 noted that models trained with datasets that are both imbalanced and small are particularly prone to overfitting to the training data as more data is collected and available for use in model training it is expected that model overfitting would decrease compared to the poisson regression the random forest model random forest performed better overall in terms of rmse and mae both models were nearly equal in the training phase however random forest performed significantly better in the evaluation phase while both models showed signs of being overfit to the training data i e a large drop in performance during the evaluation phase the proportional difference in performance between training and evaluation in the random forest predictions was roughly two thirds of that of the poisson regression a more significant difference in performance between poisson regression and random forest was seen in the stability of the predictions in the evaluation phase as measured by the standard deviations of the predictions quantitatively in the evaluation phase the standard deviations of the poisson predictions was more than three times that of the standard deviation of the random forest predictions visually the difference is apparent when comparing the standard deviation bars in the evaluation predictions in figs 3 and 5 it is important to note that model performance was measured using observed environmental conditions as model input in practice forecasted environmental conditions would be used as model input to predict flood severity for example rather than using rainfall and tide data observed at monitoring stations as input rainfall forecasts from the high resolution rapid refresh hrrr model smith et al 2008 and noaa s tide predictions noaa 2017e could be used as inputs the use of uncertain forecast rainfall data are expected to increase the overall uncertainty of the model collier 2007 bartholmes and todini 2005 4 2 false negative and false positive predictions statistics summarizing false negative and false positive predictions in the evaluation phase are given in table 4 poisson regression had fewer but more variable and extreme false positive predictions compared to random forest the false positive rate for poisson regression was 4 39 compared to 7 09 for random forest however the standard deviation of the false positive predictions was much larger from the poisson regression 8 55 flood reports compared to 3 18 flood reports for both models most of the false positive predictions were 1 17 flood reports which would round down to one the maximum false positive prediction was much greater in the poisson regression compared to the random forest 122 compared to 36 compared to the false positive rates both poisson regression and random forest had much higher false negative rates 45 92 and 34 46 respectively importantly compared to random forest poisson regression predicted false negatives when true flood reports were higher on average mean of 6 flood reports compared to 3 flood reports as with the false positives the standard deviation of the false negatives predictions was higher for poisson regression versus random forest 11 55 flood reports compared to 2 30 flood reports similarly the maximum true number of flood reports when a false negative prediction was made was much higher from poisson regression 101 flood reports compared to 9 4 2 1 variable importance fig 6 shows the importance of each of the input variables as calculated from the random forest model in terms of the percent increase in mean squared error mse when each of the variables is permuted individually the total cumulative rainfall value was by far the most important of the variables this was much more important than any of the other variables derived from the raw rainfall data including the maximum hourly and maximum 15 min rainfall values suggesting that in this record large rainfall volumes caused more flooding than high rainfall intensities the next three variables in terms of prediction importance were related to tide low tide lower low tide and higher high tide the variable importance results shown in fig 6 are supported by the raw data shown in fig 7 the number of flood reports has clear positive relationship with the total cumulative rainfall the same is true for low tide and lower low tide the relationship is less clear for the maximum hourly rainfall and the maximum 15 min rainfall but according to fig 6 the random forest model was still able to glean some meaningful information from these variables interestingly the tide level during the maximum 15 min rainfall has a clearer visual relationship with the number of flood reports compared to the maximum hourly and maximum 15 min rainfall values but is considered less important by the random forest algorithm one explanation for this may be that the information provided by the tide level during the maximum 15 min rainfall is already provided to the model perhaps in a more useful form from the low tide lower low tide and higher high tide variables the average height of the water table during a given event surprisingly did not add appreciable predictive power to the model this may suggest that the surficial groundwater table did not impact flood severity in a significant way however the fact that it did not provide predictive power does not necessarily mean that the surficial groundwater table level did not contribute to flooding for example since the infiltration of rainfall causes the surficial groundwater table to rise it is possible that the information provided by the rainfall data provides similar but clearer predictive power to the model compared to the surficial groundwater table level although total cumulative rainfall is clearly the dominant predictor of flood severity in this dataset it is commonly understood that other factors can have a significant impact on flooding in a coastal environment for example high tides alone can cause flooding in coastal cites marfai et al 2008 when tidal information is omitted from the model inputs in this study the rmse of the random forest predictions increases by 4 and by 14 for the poisson regression predictions thus while rainfall is clearly the most important variable tide levels and potentially other environmental variables cannot be ignored it is anticipated that as sea levels rise the importance of tide levels and water table level in predicting coastal flooding will grow hoover et al 2016 4 3 potential explanations for model limitations a likely reason for the limited performance in both models is the limited amount of reported street floods used to train the models the crowd sourced flood report dataset used in this study is a unique and valuable dataset but still a complete picture of flooding impacts is missing flood reports were made on only 42 or just over 5 of the records used in the modeling in addition the number of flooding reports were distributed very unequally among the 42 storm events on which flood reports were made more than 65 of the total flood reports were recorded from just six storm events 0 6 of the total storm events modeled the rarity of storm events with any flood reports and especially a large number of flood reports makes it difficult to train robust data driven models solomatine and xue 2004 faced similar problems in training their machine learning model to accurately predict high peak flows which occurred rarely in their dataset the results also suggest that compared to storm events with large volumes of rainfall which caused flooding other types of storm events were not as well modeled fig 8 shows the percent error of the random forest evaluation predictions for the 11 events with the top 10 number of reported floods two events had 101 flood reports hurricane nicole and an unnamed event occurring on 20 september 2016 two unnamed events heavy rain which occurred on 16 may 2014 35 reported flood locations and thunderstorms which occurred on 10 july 2014 39 reported flood locations have average percent error magnitudes larger than the rest both of these events had much lower cumulative rainfall and tide levels the most important variables in the model see fig 6 but higher maximum hourly rainfall and relatively high maximum 15 min rainfall values compared to the other high flooding events given this it is possible that these events caused flash floods the worse performance of the models at predicting the flooding severity from these two events may suggest that this type of flooding is not well represented in the training dataset it is expected that the data driven models would better predict such flood events with a larger more complete dataset containing more instances of similar flooding events additionally with more training data the models could be trained on specific subsets of flood events tailoring it to a type of flood event with specific characteristics e g flash floods besides the limited number of flooding events with which to train the models bias present in the training data could have hampered model performance because the flooded locations were reported by individuals there is an unknown amount of subjectivity and bias in the data as can be expected when using crowd sourced data since the models are trained on data reported by individuals one individual may influence the trained model disproportionally fig 9 shows the total number of flood reports made by each individual reporter and the number of flood events for which each reporter recorded at least one flooded location during the period of record the highest number of total reports made by one reporter was 158 14 of the sum total reports from all 71 reporters therefore the models in their training are significantly influenced by this one reporter and can inherit to some extent his her biases another potential bias is in the under or over representation of different roadway types in the flooding record fig 10 shows the percentage of roadway length per vdot roadway class in norfolk and the percent of each roadway class at which flood reports were made table 5 gives the descriptions for each of the classes from the figure it is seen that although public local streets class 6 account for the majority of the roadway length of the city close to 60 only 40 of the flooded streets reported were of this class conversely principal arterials class 3 accounted for nearly 30 of the flooded street reports even though these streets make up 10 of norfolk s total roadway length this suggests that a flooded street less traveled and therefore less important to the overall connectivity of the city s street network may have flooded but may not have been reported within the record with the same frequency as the more major roads a third example of bias may occur when unequal attention in reporting is given to certain geographic areas of the city or to certain storm events one example of this bias is seen in the difference in reported floods between hurricane hermine and hurricane matthew which occurred only one month apart for hurricane hermine 22 flood reports more than half of the total of 40 flood reports made as a result of hurricane hermine came from one area in downtown norfolk in contrast for hurricane matthew which produced more than three times as much total cumulative rainfall on average than hurricane hermine 264 mm compared to 84 mm and was at least comparable in terms of tide water table height and wind conditions only six flood reports were made from the same area it is unlikely that the actual flooding caused by hurricane matthew a much larger storm was in fact a quarter in severity but more likely that there were significant differences in reporting between the two events 4 4 increase in street flood reports flooding reports and events have become more frequent over the period of record september 2010 to october 2016 the number of flooded street reports has increased year to year in the past four years and overall in the past seven years see fig 11 more than twice as many floods were reported in 2016 compared to 2014 very few flood reports were made in 2013 compared to the other years of record this can be explained at least in part because 2013 was an exceptionally mild hurricane season the first since 1994 without any major hurricanes the only storm event in 2013 reported to have caused flooding was an unnamed heavy rain event the overall increase in the number of flood reports over the period of record was due primarily to an increase in the number of storm events from which flood reports were made rather than an increase in the number of reports per storm event in the years 2010 2013 five total storm events were reported to have caused flooding while in 2014 alone 16 events were reported to have caused flooding and at least 10 storm events per year resulted in reports of flooded streets in 2015 and 2016 see fig 11 in contrast to the storm events reported in 2010 2013 most of the storm events reported to have caused flooding in the years 2014 2016 were smaller unnamed storm events in each of the years 2010 2011 and 2012 there was a storm event for which more than 100 flood reports were made each of them named major hurricanes nicole irene and sandy respectively in 2014 on the other hand of the 16 storm events reported to have caused flooding the maximum number of flood reports for an individual storm event was 39 and only one named hurricane was reported to have caused flooding hurricane arthur the increase in flood reports due to smaller storms from 2014 to 2016 may suggest that the city of norfolk is becoming more susceptible to flooding from less extreme storm events i e storm events which are not hurricanes it is noted that most of the flood reports were made by staff of the city which operates with limited resources in reality the number of flood locations resulting from the recorded storm events could be larger than what was reported including street floods that may have occurred from less extreme events in 2010 2013 it is also possible that the increase in flood reports over the period of record may simply be due to an increase in attention given to street flooding and resources to street flood reporting in norfolk rather than an increase in actual flooding an increase in attention and resources allocated to street flooding and street flood reporting from the city of norfolk however may still suggest that flooding problems are worsening sweet and park 2014 noted an increase of nuisance level tidal flooding in norfolk va from 1 2 days per year in the years 1956 1960 to 7 4 days per year in the years 2006 2010 sweet and park 2014 also predicted that the amount of flooding will increase with time due to predicted sea level rise this is in agreement with the increase of flood reports seen in the present study as sea level rises and climate changes it may be necessary to incorporate a mechanism to account for this change into data driven predictive models this change be referred to as concept drift gama et al 2014 gama and castillo 2006 and mechanisms for accounting for it would be especially useful when using random forest which as noted above cannot exceed the range of training data 5 conclusions two data driven models poisson regression and random forest were trained to predict flood severity for a given set of environmental conditions rainfall tide levels groundwater levels and wind conditions using quality controlled crowd sourced street flooding reports as a proxy output variable the data used for training and evaluating the models was from norfolk virginia usa the random forest model performed better overall compared to poisson regression in the evaluation phase root mean squared error of 3 87 compared to 6 71 flood reports mean absolute error of 0 69 compared to 0 96 flood reports with less variance standard deviation of 6 00 compared to 18 42 flood reports the most important variable in predicting model output in the random forest model was by far total cumulative rainfall followed by low tide and lower low tide it is important to note that the flood report data was available only on a daily time step and the analysis was completed for flood events which sometimes stretched over a multi day period variable importantance may change if flood report data were available at a hourly or subhourly resolution and used in the analysis the quality controlled crowd sourced flood data provided by the city of norfolk despite limited spatial and temporal coverage provided an uncommonly detailed flood record in the record flooding at individual intersections and streets was recorded for many events over an extended period of time using this as training data the models demonstrated in this paper could give city workers a reasonable estimate of flooding severity across the study region based on forecasted environmental conditions this is a first step in the long term goal of spatially and temporally detailed urban flood predictions to assist city managers in real time flood adaptation measures such as traffic management this also demonstrates one way that crowd sourced data despite its limitations can provide useful information to flood prediction models a main limiting factor in building accurate models is the quantity and quality of the record of flooding used to train the model given the bias present in the training dataset due in part to a limited number of flood reports predictions were necessarily lumped spatially predictions were made at the city scale and temporally predictions were made at a event time scale while other work has raised the need for accurate and dense measurements of rainfall sadler et al 2017 hill et al 2014 the primary input to flood models the results of this work highlight the need for more accurate and complete record of flooding data including depth and duration of flood occurrences such data is needed to adequately train flood models with enough spatial and temporal detail to help make street level real time operational decisions given more complete and objective flood occurrence data it is likely that a data driven model such as the ones demonstrated in this paper could predict street flooding with much greater precision the need for a more complete flood record data may be filled with a street level sensor network eliminating human subjectivity and providing higher temporal resolution of street flooding events such a sensor network is currently being piloted to record water levels at frequently flooded intersections in norfolk the detailed data from this network could be used to further improve predictions from models such as those demonstrated in this paper crowd sourced data such as flood reports made by citizens from smart phone apps could also be useful although the subjectivity in publicly crowd sourced data would likely be similar to the dataset used in the paper a wider number of reporters could help to mitigate subjectivity and result in a more complete understanding of the spatial and temporal extent of road flooding occurrences data availability in an effort to make this study reproducible all data and computational

7369,digital elevation model dem is one of the most important controlling factors determining the simulation accuracy of hydraulic models however the currently available global topographic data is confronted with limitations for application in 2 d hydraulic modeling mainly due to the existence of vegetation bias random errors and insufficient spatial resolution a hydraulic correction method hcm for the srtm dem is proposed in this study to improve modeling accuracy firstly we employ the global vegetation corrected dem i e bare earth dem developed from the srtm dem to include both vegetation height and srtm vegetation signal then a newly released dem removing both vegetation bias and random errors i e multi error removed dem is employed to overcome the limitation of height errors last an approach to correct the multi error removed dem is presented to account for the insufficiency of spatial resolution ensuring flow connectivity of the river networks the approach involves a extracting river networks from the multi error removed dem using an automated algorithm in arcgis b correcting the location and layout of extracted streams with the aid of google earth platform and remote sensing imagery and c removing the positive biases of the raised segment in the river networks based on bed slope to generate the hydraulically corrected dem the proposed hcm utilizes easily available data and tools to improve the flow connectivity of river networks without manual adjustment to demonstrate the advantages of hcm an extreme flood event in huifa river basin china is simulated on the

hydraulic model srtm 1 introduction the frequent occurrence of extreme floods e g pakistan in 2010 thailand in 2011 india in 2014 china in 2016 has drawn continuous attention from the public and research communities in recent years historically flooding has been recognized as one of the main types of natural hazards in terms of economic damages and casualties dottori et al 2016 between 1980 and 2013 flooding had caused about 1 trillion direct economic losses and 220 000 fatalities re 2014 flood induced damages and causalities are widely predicted to dramatically increase due to economic

et al 2017a b implementing more effective flood risk reduction and management strategies has become an important task for governments at different levels across the world in recent years significant efforts have been made to better understand the physical process of flooding and develop different types of models to predict flood hazard numerical mathematical models for quantifying and mapping flood hazards and risks have become effective tools in facilitating flood risk management and reducing the catastrophic impacts european commission 2007 many up to date advanced hydro system analysis methods e g discrete principal monotonicity method cheng et al 2016a b have been developed to simulate highly complicated hydrological processes which are based on the responses between input and output datasets besides the data driven models mechanism based flood models have also been developed with different levels of complexity ranging from the simplified lumped approaches distributed hydrological models to the highly detailed 2 d hydraulic models the data driven models and lumped models e g gr model perrin et al 2003 deal with the system as a whole and do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of the problem domain khakbaz et al 2012 however flooding may present clear spatial variations as influenced by localized weather and topographic conditions chen et al 2017a cheng et al 2017c d distributed hydrological models e g swat arnold et al 1998 take into account the heterogeneities in both the catchment characteristics and hydrometeorological inputs nguyen et al 2015 chen et al 2017b however they usually adopt conceptual or simplified approaches to route runoffs and flood waves khan and valeo 2016 and are incapable of representing certain common flow phenomena such as flow over flat slopes reversing flow and backwater effect kim et al 2012 this may constrain the wider application in flood risk management where detailed floodplain hydrodynamics is typically required the 2 d hydraulic models can simulate the dynamics of surface runoff across watersheds with complex topographies using minimal model parameters in accordance with continuity and momentum principles hydraulic models better depict the dynamics of flood waves and physical characteristics of the watersheds with the availability of rich sources of high resolution topographic and hydrological data and much enhanced computational power a number of 2 d hydraulic models have been successfully applied to flood simulations at the watershed scale e g neal et al 2012 paiva et al 2013 hydraulic models rely

2015 an alternative to srtm is aster the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer fujisada et al 2012 however although the spatial resolution of aster 30 m has an advantage over that of srtm 90 m srtm is more suitable for hydraulic modeling as it is distorted by fewer surface objects with higher vertical accuracy jing et al 2014 athmania and achour 2014 rexer and hirt 2014 varga and bašić 2015 chaieb et al 2016 for these reasons this study will focus on srtm dem srtm dem has been widely used for flood modeling in previous studies e g sanders 2007 samantaray et al 2015 fernández et al 2016 but all of the existing works have faced the same challenge i e how to remove the vegetation bias presented in the original srtm dem and to obtain a bare earth dem from srtm dem o loughlin et al 2016 the inability of the c band radar employed by srtm to completely penetrate the vegetation canopy to the ground has caused significant positive biases in the srtm dem brown et al 2010 thus the original srtm dem may overestimate the ground elevation in certain areas carabajal and harding 2005 lalonde et al 2010 shortridge and messina 2011 wang et al 2012 baugh et al 2013 indicated that removing the vegetation bias for srtm dem in a reach of the amazon basin clearly improved hydrodynamic modeling accuracy in terms of both water depth and inundation extent a number of other researchers have also tried to correct the vegetation bias before flood modeling however all of these existing works did not consider either the spatial variability of the vegetation height wilson et al 2007 coe et al 2010 paiva et al 2011 or the spatial variability of srtm vegetation permeation signal baugh et al 2013 pinel et al 2015 luo et al 2017 besides all of the studies mentioned above have conducted in the amazon basin so more case studies with different watershed characteristics should be further considered to better understand the problem recently the release of global forest canopy heights lefsky 2010 simard et al 2011 and other related remote sensing products has provided a desirable opportunity to enable systematic vegetation corrections for srtm dem accounting for the spatial variability of both vegetation height and srtm vegetation signal o loughlin et al 2016 combined these remote sensing datasets to correct the vegetation bias in the original srtm dem and developed the first global bare earth dem the bare earth dem showed great improvements in vertical accuracy of the vegetated areas and is openly available in this study we will first attempt to examine this utility of the bare earth dem for flood inundation modeling in a natural basin outside of the amazon basin in addition to the vegetation bias srtm dem also contains various random errors which are non negligible for flood modeling random errors can be classified by their spatial scale into speckle noise strip noise and absolute bias yamazaki et al 2017 the presence of speckle noise is one common characteristic of sar dems like srtm zandbergen 2008 mainly caused by variability of surface reflectance over flat terrain takaku et al 2016 speckle noise has the consequence of increasing slope estimates at short distances alsdorf et al 2007 falorni et al 2005 kielet al 2006 speckling generally has a negative effect on flood modeling in particular in areas of floodplain with low slopes stripe noise is a regular height undulation with a wavelength of 500 m to 100 km gallant and read 2009 tarekegn and sayama 2013 yamazaki et al 2017 the stripe noise of the srtm dem is mainly caused by uncompensated mast motion error walker et al 2007 which can cause significant errors in simulating spatial flood extent tarekegn and sayama 2013 the absolute bias can be regarded as a departure in the average elevation over a large domain typically 20 km scale yamazaki et al 2017 caused by long wavelength random residual satellite motion errors rodriguez et al 2006 the spatial pattern of absolute bias is not homogeneous because multiple data with different absolute biases were overlaid during the creation procedure of srtm dem thus it is highly necessary to eliminate multiple error components including vegetation bias and three random errors before integrating the srtm dem in flood modeling however treating multiple error components is not easy because different error components could offset each other and thus difficult to accurately recognize and estimate error magnitude fortunately yamazaki et al 2017 newly released the first global multi error removed improved terrain dem by correcting all major error components in srtm dem which shows better vertical accuracy than the original dem in this study we will simultaneously examine this utility of the bare earth dem and multi error removed dem for flood inundation modeling besides the multiple height errors the spatial resolution of global srtm dem 90 m are not fine enough to represent the small scale topographic features such as narrow river or channel networks they are the key elements for reliable depiction of watershed hydrodynamics in hydraulic models especially for the watersheds with complex terrain yamazaki et al 2012 schumann et al 2014 moreover srtm is influenced by surface artifacts such as artificial buildings which may break flow connectivity along channel networks or between the river channel and hillslope systems callow et al 2007 sanders 2007 lehner et al 2008 thus the dem needs to be pre processed to better represent hydrological characteristics particularly in places where the flow connectivity is lost various algorithms have been developed for hydrologically correcting dems it is usually considered that one of the major challenges impeding flow connectivity is the pit s i e one or more adjacent pixels with lower elevation values than its or their surrounded pixels the pit s can unphysically block water and cause disconnected flow paths kenny et al 2008 lee et al 2017 the common pit removal methods include lifting jenson and domingue 1988 carving martz and garbrecht 1999 and the combination of lifting and carving soille 2004 these pits removal algorithms are useful for improving flow connectivity in dems with high spatial resolution such as airborne lidar dems however they are not effective for the srtm dem because the elevation values of sub pixel scale hydrology features may be also lifted by surrounding objects such as bridge and building etc yamazaki et al 2012 in the aforementioned algorithms these pits are treated equally without considering whether they are real or spurious thus the corrected dems may not well represent the realistic terrains other related pre processing methods include stream burning e g lehner et al 2008 and ridge fencing e g masutomi et al 2009 etc but they also suffer from the same issue and create corrected dems that may not represent the realistic terrains yamazaki et al 2012 proposed an alternative method that treated the river networks from the hydrosheds datasets lehner et al 2008 as given information and then removed the pits of the river networks to ensure flow connectivity along the rivers lehner et al 2008 developed the river network dataset using mainly standard gis techniques the process of deriving river networks through pit filling is automated and simple in esri s arcgis software but it cannot ensure the dem derived river networks resembling the known networks kenny et al 2008 especially in those flat areas pan et al 2012 moreover when removing the pits in the river networks the parameters of the adopted weighting function for deciding the level of modification were obtained by trial and error and needed manual adjustment and they did not account for the terrain harmony between the networks and hillslopes to overcome the shortcomings of the existing dem correction methods for application of srtm dem in flood modeling there is thereby a need to develop an approach to generate new hydraulically corrected dem to support 2 d hydraulic simulation on the basis of multi error removed dem yamazaki et al 2017 we proposed a new hydraulic correction method hcm to effectively correct the dem and ensure flow connectivity along the river channel networks meanwhile the vegetation bias will be investigated using the bare earth dem developed from srtm dem by o loughlin et al 2016 accounting for the spatial variability of both vegetation height and srtm vegetation signal the multi error removed dem is also investigated to test its utility in flood inundation simulation the purpose of the current study is to identify the limitations of srtm dem in 2 d watershed hydraulic simulation and to improve its utility based on available auxiliary data and tools 2 methodology 2 1 new hydraulic correction method hcm for the srtm dem in order to correct the srtm dem to better replicate the hydrology features of a watershed and improve hydraulic flood simulation results the new hydraulic correction method hcm is proposed as a removing the vegetation bias and random errors and b ensuring flow connectivity fig 1 the bare earth dem developed is employed to account for the vegetation bias in the srtm dem the multi error removed dem yamazaki et al 2017 is adopted to investigate both the vegetation bias and random errors in this sub section the approach to ensuring flow connectivity is introduced in detail 2 1 1 generation of river networks analysis algorithms have become widely available to extract river networks from dems river networks are routinely defined as pixels with drainage areas that are greater than a threshold value in this study the preliminary networks are automatically generated from the hydrology toolboxes in arcgis e g the blue lines in fig 2 and fig 3 the preliminary networks in certain places are detected to move away from their exact locations the exact layout and location of river channels can be mapped from the high spatial resolution images 1 m obtained from the google earth platform which is accessible by the public to achieve this the preliminary networks generated from arcgis are converted into keyhole markup language kml and then overlaid on google earth the inexact parts are drawn manually on the virtual globe viewing window and then saved on a new kml file the new kml is imported into arcgis and used to replace the inexact parts i e the red lines in fig 3 it should be noted that the optimum images displayed in google earth may come from different years to ensure the networks reflecting the hydrological conditions of the specific year under consideration the corrected networks will be further compared with and verified against the hj 1a b ccd images obtained at the same time if the verification fails the networks will be corrected or supplemented again in arcgis 2 1 2 processing approach for flow connectivity after obtaining the exact positions and layouts of the river networks the river profiles are extracted from the dem for each river channel its profile consists of a series of elevation values from the most upstream point to the outlet along the flow direction an example is shown in fig 4 a and a number of obstacles impeding flow connectivity are detected in the selected river profile the line segments containing the three most obvious obstacles are marked within the blue boxes and will be further analyzed in the virtue of google earth platform for segment 1 fig 4b the channel width is narrow 15 m in this reach with a resolution of 90 m the center points of dem pixel fall outside the river and pick up the higher elevation values in the surrounding locations for example the points with elevations of 426 m 425 m 423 m and 420 m are all located in the riverbank a few points with higher elevations of 444 m 454 m and 457 m are found on the vegetated mountain as shown in fig 4b for segment 2 as shown in fig 4c the points have captured the elevation of a dam and the dam s appendages which are higher than the upstream points 383 m and seriously hinder the reservoir outflow for segment 3 as illustrated in fig 4d although the channel reach is wide enough to be captured by the dem pixels the center points of the pixels may not coincide with the central line of the river generally has a lower elevation which inevitably results in overestimation of channel elevation and subsequently reduces conveyance although there are pits in the river profile due to the white noise in the dem majority of the obstacles that impede flow connectivity have positive biases due to the surface objects or the offset of river central line in the dem herein we propose a new approach to remove the positive biases and rebuild flow connectivity for river networks the positive biases are removed by caving the raised segment to maintain a reasonable river slope and terrain harmony between the networks and hillslopes the corrected value for every raised river channel is calculated by taking into account the slope between the nearest upstream pixel and the nearest downstream pixel outside the raised segment fig 5 the slope s and correction value δ are calculated by 1 s z upstream z downstream n 1 1 2 δ i s i 3 z cor i z i δ i where n is the number of pixels contained in the raised segment under consideration z upstream and z downstream are the elevations of the nearest upstream and downstream pixels outside the raised segment z i is the elevation of pixel i before correction where i is the index of the pixels within the segment z cor i is the corresponding corrected elevation and δ i is the value to be corrected for pixel i in the previous studies dems are mainly corrected using pit removal which may excessively alter the elevations and destroy the realistic terrains without distinguishing true and false pits the correction approach proposed in this work identifies the real positive biases in the srtm dem followed by caving the positive biases of the raised segment the correction focuses on the key hydrology features river drainage networks rather than the whole basin to avoid exaggerated modification meanwhile compared with the pit removal method that required manual adjustment yamazaki et al 2012 the current approach is reinforced by the slope condition of the topography in the multi error removed dem which may better represent the realistic terrains for each river channel inside the watershed the raised segments are corrected one by one using the proposed method from upstream to downstream fig 4e this river profile correction procedure will be applied to every river and tributary until flow connectivity of the whole river network is guaranteed 2 2 integrated hydrologic hydraulic modeling to simulate the watershed scale flood evolution a 2 d hydraulic model is adopted and applied in this study however most of the existing hydraulic models are not capable of representing certain key hydrological process such as evapotranspiration interception and infiltration herein an integrated hydrologic hydraulic modeling approach is developed and used in which the surface runoff generated from a rainstorm is generated by a hydrologic model and used as inputs to drive the hydraulic model and create flooding 2 2 1 hydrologic modeling the scs cn model is adopted in this work because of its simplicity stability and success in previous studies for runoff generation mishra and singh 2007 the models consider most of key watershed characteristics related to runoff generation including land use soil type and antecedent moisture condition chen et al 2016 infiltration models such as horton and green ampt methods have been also used together with hydraulic models to predict surface runoff from intense rainfall fernández et al 2016 but these models commonly require substantial field data for model calibration and verification and are not suitable for the current study the scs cn model is designed for predicting surface runoff sr of a specified rainstorm as follows mishra and singh 1999 woodward et al 2002 4 sr p i a 2 p i a s where p is the precipitation depth s is the maximum potential retention i a is the initial abstraction defined as i a λ s with λ taken as 0 2 and s is a parameter related to the curve number cn as follows 5 s 2540 cn 25 4 cn is the only parameter in scs cn and its value determined by the watershed characteristics may be obtained from section 4 of the national engineering handbook scs 1956 it should be noted that scs cn was originally designed to compute the total runoff volume and is not a time advancing method in this study in order to generate runoff volumes that are consistent with the spatial and temporal resolution of the 2 d hydraulic model scs cn is performed at every time step and in every cell of the computational grid that decomposes the computational domain i e the watershed under consideration according to caviedes voullième et al 2012 the cumulative surface runoff for a given time is computed from the cumulative precipitation from the beginning of the rainfall event to the specific time being considered the surface runoff for a specific time step is the increment calculated by subtracting the cumulative runoff from the previous time step consistent with the spatial resolution of the available dem scs cn is implemented in every 90 m 90 m pixel inside the study area the cumulative precipitation antecedent soil moisture land use and soil type for each pixel are provided or defined at each of the pixels herein hourly cumulative precipitation that drives a simulation is estimated via interpolation from the four closest precipitation stations using the inverse distance squared weighting method antecedent soil moisture is determined from the precipitation five days before the flood land use data is available from the global land cover mapping chen et al 2015 and soil type information is derived from the harmonized world soil database nachtergaele et al 2012 2 2 2 2 d hydraulic modeling a fully dynamic hydraulic model based on the 2 d depth averaged shallow water equations is adopted in this work for flood simulations the conservative form of the governing 2 d shallow water equations is expressed as follows 6 q t f x g y s where t is the time x and y represent the cartesian coordinates q denotes the flow variable vector f and g are the flux vectors in the x and y direction respectively and s is the source term vector the vector terms are defined as q h q x q y f q x uq x 1 2 gh 2 uq y 7 g q y vq x vq y 1 2 gh 2 s 0 c f u u 2 v 2 gh z b x c f v u 2 v 2 gh z b x where h is the water depth qx uh and qy vh are the unit width discharges in the x and y directions respectively u and v denote the depth averaged velocities in two cartesian directions and zb is the bed elevation and cf is the bed roughness coefficient the above governing equations are solved using a shock capturing finite volume godunov type scheme on uniform grids detailed description of the model can be found in hou et al 2014 and xia et al 2017 to substantially improve its computational efficiency for large scale flood simulations the current model is implemented for parallelized computing on multiple gpus using nvidia s parallel computing architecture cuda compute unified device architecture a gpu accelerated model was reported to be 10 s times computationally more efficient than its counterpart running on a cpu jarihani et al 2015 the 2 d hydraulic model is set up using the available topographic and roughness data and driven by the hourly surface runoff volumes calculated by scs cn at every computational pixel the runoff is then automatically routed by the hydraulic model within the computational domain before confluence at the basin outlet the topographic data used in this work include the original dem bare earth dem multi error dem and hydraulically corrected dem roughness of the watershed is indicated by the manning coefficient n standard values of the manning coefficient corresponding to different watershed characteristics may be found from a hydraulics textbook or report e g chow 1959 barnes 1967 arcement and schneider 1984 and using these values in hydraulic modeling has become a common practice e g mtamba et al 2015 garrote et al 2016 the manning coefficients are specified according to different land use types as available from the global land cover mapping chen et al 2015 0 15 for forest 0 035 for arable land 0 03 for grassland 0 027 for water surface and 0 016 for construction land simulation results from the integrated hydrologic hydraulic model are validated against time histories of water depth measured at gauge stations and inundation extent derived from remotely sensed images water depths predicted on different dems are evaluated through comparison with gauge records predicted flood extents are compared with the flood footprints extracted from the hj 1a b imagery based on normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 and enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 2002 ndwi can effectively distinguish water signal against most of the terrestrial and soil features with ndwi classified into open water ndwi 0 and non water ndwi 0 however the open water class may not all correspond to flood footprints because certain places may quickly dry up after being flooded and do not contain open water therefore these temporally flooded areas may be missed out by ndwi leading to derivation of unreliable flood footprints evi is a widely used proxy of vegetation greenness to evaluate the terrestrial photosynthetic activity shi et al 2017 the difference between the evis before and after a flood event reflects the degree of vegetation being damaged by flood and is a useful indicator for identifying inundated areas in this work ndwi and evi are used to derive flood extents for evaluating simulation results the formulas for calculating ndwi and evi are given as follows 8 ndwi r green r nir r green r nir 9 evi 2 5 r nir r red r nir 6 r red 7 5 r blue 1 where r nir r red r green and r blue are referred as the reflectance of the near infrared red green and blue bands of hj 1a b ccd images respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 study area and the flood event a 267 km reach of the huifa river in the northeastern china fig 2 is selected as the case study approximately 33 of the total areas are covered by forests with clear spatial variation making it an ideal site for investigating the influence of vegetation bias in the original srtm dem on flood modeling the river networks are characterized by numerous tributaries and sub pixel sized channels and their representation is particularly sensitive to dem quality and important for flood modeling providing a desired case study to test the applicability of the hydraulically improved dem for use in 2 d hydraulic flood modeling detailed hydrometeorological data are available for the study site including rainfall records from 253 precipitation stations and continuous water depth measurements from 8 hydrologic stations along the main channel reach meanwhile hj 1a b ccd images are available to derive the actual flooded areas the huifa river has a basin area of 14 896 km2 and is mainly located in jilin province northeastern china the local climate is dominated by continental monsoons with an annual average of 720 mm the rainfall has a clear seasonal variation rainfall occurs mostly during summer and autumn and 44 7 of the annual total is recorded in july and august zhang et al 2012 corresponding to the seasonal rainfall variation there is a clearly defined flood season from june to september and a dry period from october to the following may according to gauge station records during 1965 2015 the mean discharge of huifa river is 83 70 m3 s and the maximum peak discharge is measured to be 3410 m3 s occurring during the flood season in 2013 the 2013 extreme flood event will be further investigated in this study in august 2013 an area average rainfall of 221 mm was recorded in the huifa river basin leading to an extreme flood event with a 50 year return period jin et al 2015 the flood caused disastrous consequences in all three northeast provinces i e heilongjiang jilin and liaoning according to the ministry of civil affairs approximately 5 million people were affected 95 people were killed 154 622 houses were damaged and 1 59 million hectares of croplands were affected hong kong red cross 2013 3 2 hydraulically corrected srtm dem using arcgis google earth and hj 1a b ccd images we acquire the exact layout and locations of the river networks in the huifa river basin fig 3 the river networks consist of a total of 312 tributaries with length ranging from 0 5 km to 267 km river networks may be quickly generated from a dem using arcgis however the resulting networks may contain obvious inaccuracies in both location and layout which may be easily detected by overlaying the derived networks with google earth imagines in flood modeling flow connectivity of the river networks is a key factor affecting the simulation results it is necessary to correct the river networks derived directly from a dem to support more reliable flood predictions the availability of google earth at high spatial resolution and hj 1a b ccd images has provided an opportunity to resolve the issue by combining arcgis google earth with the timely remote sensing images we may now accurately position river networks and improve their flow connectivity in basins of different scales herein the proposed hcm is used to ensure flow connectivity of the river networks in the huifa river basin among the 2349 401 pixels of the multi error removed dem inside the basin 37 032 pixels 1 6 pixels are identified to form raised segments breaking the flow connectivity of the river networks the amount of correction as required is less than 1 m at 14 025 pixels 38 and less than 2 m at 26 551 pixels 72 in all of the modified pixels 95 of them require correction of less than 4 m the average amount of correction is only 46 mm for the whole basin supporting material fig s1 shows the 6 main channels see in fig 2 in the study area it is observed that the overall topographic features of all 6 channels are well maintained following flow connectivity reconstruction meanwhile when the elevations of the channel pixels are adjusted to more reasonable values the exchange of flow between hillslopes and river networks may be better depicted in 2 d hydraulic modeling 3 3 validation of simulation results with in suit measured water depths to validate the flood simulation results on the four dems as considered in this work the surface runoff generated from scs cn is compared with the discharge measured in the wudaogou station near the basin outlet see supporting material fig s2 and the water depths calculated by the 2 d hydraulic model are compared with the measurements available at the eight gauge stations within the model domain see fig 2 the eight gauge stations are located along the main tributaries with contributing basin areas varying from 150 km2 to 2000 km2 table 1 the predicted and measured hourly hydrographs of water depth are shown in fig 6 for all eight stations the calculated root mean square errors rmse and the difference between the predicted and measured maximum water depths di are summarized in table 1 the total runoff volume computed from scs cn is 1 36 109 m3 the actual volume measured in the wudaogou station is 1 52 109 m3 the error between the computed and measured is approximately 11 which is acceptable this also confirms that the adopted cn numbers derived based on the watershed characteristics and previous research are reasonable the depth hydrographs calculated on the original dem represented by the red lines in fig 6 and the bare earth dem and multi error removed dem represented by yellow lines and green lines respectively in fig 6 are somehow similar with peak water depth underestimated at almost all eight stations at stations 1 2 5 and 8 the predicted depth hydrographs feature a correct rising falling process however the magnitudes of the predicted depths are not consistent with the observations and the peak water depths predicted on the original dem are approximately 0 3 m larger than those predicted on the bare earth dem this may be because the bare earth dem has lower elevation values after removing vegetation bias vegetation bias removal effectively makes the dem values to become the same level as the surrounding topography leading to more flood water detained on the hillslopes and less water discharged to stream outlets the multi error removed dem performs better in predicting the peak water depths than the original dem and the bare earth dem at stations 1 5 and 8 at stations 3 and 6 simulations on the original dem bare earth dem and multi error removed dem all predict a dry river with no water depth the correct water depth hydrograph is not reproduced because the water flow cannot move from upstream to the gauge station as a result of blocked channel and broken flow connectivity at stations 4 and 7 the water depth suddenly increases and then maintains at a constant depth this suggests that the dems have turned both of the locations to become pits as a result the flood water maintains at a constant level after the pits are quickly filled comparing the depth hydrographs predicted on the hydraulically corrected dem with those predicted on the other three dems shows that at most of the stations the corrected dem performs better in predicting the rise and fall process of water depth and peak water depth the results from the corrected dem indicate that the model has succeeded in depicting the rising falling process of the water depth at all eight stations except for stations 7 and 8 the peak water depths predicted on the corrected dem agree more closely with the observed values and higher than those predicted on the other three dems this is because the predicted water flow successfully propagates from upstream to the outlet through the connecting networks which are better represented in the corrected dem via the correcting method outlined in the previous section it needs to be noted that the simulation on the corrected dem overestimates the peak water depth at station 8 the reason may be that the river channel becomes smoothed following the dem correction process leading to reduced retention volume another possible reason may be because the storage of reservoirs is not considered in the current study the results demonstrate that improved 2 d flood modeling can be achieved by better depicting the connected channels using the hydraulic correction method as proposed in this study to process a dem 3 4 validation of simulation results with remote sensing images the inundation extent predicted by the 2 d hydraulic model is compared with the satellite observations of flood footprint obtained from the hj 1a b ccd images two hj images are used one was acquired during the flood period on 23 august 2013 and another was acquired before the flood event on 6 july 2013 based on the ndwi 0 calculated from the image during flood period the surface water area can be identified including rivers lakes and ponding areas however the surface water area may be significantly less than the actual inundation area because flood water can pass certain regions without forming open water i e boundaries of inundated areas mohammadi et al 2017 so the vegetation response is also adopted to obtain the flood footprint by identifying the changes in evi values the ratio of evis after and before the flood event is calculated for every pixel we then extract the pixels in which the vegetation has been negatively influenced by the flood event eviafter evibefore 0 35 and evibefore 0 the evi ratio of 0 35 is taken to extract the pixels that are obviously influenced by flooding the natural fluctuations e g the evi of crop may slightly decrease from before the flood event corresponding to peak growth stage to after the flood event corresponding to mature stage are excluded to ensure that pure flood footprints are acquired considering the fact that certain flood footprints may not involve either water response or vegetation response satellite observations of flood footprints from the hj 1a b ccd images cannot present all areas that are inundated by flood water we therefore separately analyze the simulation performance to reflect the water response and vegetation response for the surface water area the ratio of overlap areas roa is used to assess simulation performance in predicting open water roa is defined as the ratio between the hj and simulation overlapping area and the hj surface water area to evaluate the performance spatially we compute roa in every window containing 4 4 pixels fig 7 b d and count roa values within the 12 sub basins fig 7a and table 2 similar results are obtained for the original dem and bare earth dem simulations thus the result drawing of bare earth dem is not shown in fig 7 due to space limitation in huifa river basin vegetation removal bare earth dem shows no improvement in accuracy for predicting open water areas compared with the use of original dem instead the resulting simulation performance is observed to deteriorate in certain sub basins such as sub basin 9 and 12 on the other hand hydraulic flood simulation on the multi error removed dem shows obvious improvement in almost all sub basins the overall accuracy of predicting surface water areas against the hj image has been improved from a roa of 0 67 original dem and 0 65 bare earth dem to 0 71 multi error removed dem among all the four dems the hydraulically corrected dem performs the best in predicting surface water areas in the whole basin and all sub basins the overall accuracy of predicting surface water areas against the hj image rises to 0 79 comparison between these predicted surface water areas visually shows that simulations on the original dem and bare earth dem only correctly predict inundation in a few small areas in the midstream including the corresponding main channel and sub basins 5 6 and 11 40 whereas the simulation on the multi error removed dem and the corrected dem show a marked improvement and the corrected dem accurately predicts most of the observed water surface areas 70 this implies that well connected river networks ensure flow connectivity and lead to improved flood prediction discharge of the water flow alongside the networks to evaluate the performance of simulation results in terms of representing the vegetation response to the flood event the predicted flood map is assessed through comparison with the areas with vegetation response the pixels with vegetation response are typically located at the boundaries of open water areas which are mainly covered by grain crops according to ganji et al 2012 when the inundation depth is 0 2 m crop yield will be obviously affected so we count the percentage of the predicted maximum water depth 0 2 m in the areas with vegetation response table 3 and fig 8 the percentage of water depth 0 2 m increases from 44 predicted on the original dem and 55 on the multi error removed dem to 61 on the corrected dem for the whole basin the evidently improved prediction of flooded areas are concentrated on the downstream which indicates that better connected river networks can lead to better representation of overbank flows along the river channels 3 5 discussions the results comparison obtained from simulations on the original dem and bare earth dem shows that these dems give similar results it means that vegetation removal does not bring obvious improvement for 2 d hydraulic modeling in huifa river basin however previous related studies in amazon river basin indicated that srtm vegetation removal could greatly improve the hydrodynamic modeling accuracy wilson et al 2007 baugh et al 2013 a possible reason for the difference may be because our study area is a mountainous watershed with high vegetation i e forest is mainly distributed in areas with high slopes thus vegetation removal does not cause any major change to the relative topographic conditions e g the average slope of basin only changes from 5 78 to 5 70 after vegetation removal subsequently vegetation removal does not impose significant change to the flow connectivity between hillslopes and river channels this is the reason that we do not focus more on vegetation removal method in this study and just use a generated data set meanwhile in comparison with the amazon river basin the current study area consists of relatively fragmented fields and this may also be another reason for the limited improvement in the simulation accuracy the bare earth dem o loughlin et al 2016 was obtained from the 250 m modis vegetation continuous field product dimiceli et al 2011 as a proxy of vegetation signal and the 1 km global vegetation height map simard et al 2011 the resolution of these vegetation data may be capable of capturing the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation height in amazon floodplain covered by more uniformly distributed rainforests but is may be too coarse for the huifa basin with smaller fields and different types of forests zhang et al 2008 therefore the necessity of vegetation removal for srtm dem in 2 d hydraulic modeling should be considered together with the specific watershed conditions of the study area under consideration more research case studies need to be done to examine the applicability and performance of bare earth dem in 2 d flood modeling although vegetation bias removal does not bring improvement for 2 d hydraulic modeling the multi error removed dem achieves obvious improvement in predicting inundation areas with water response and vegetation response we find that the flatness of the topography in flat areas floodplain is recovered well to some extent moreover some abnormal bulges and depressions in river stream have been removed and thus the flow connectivity of streams have been improved compared to the original dem and the bare earth dem thus the flow connectivity inside the floodplains and the river networks as key factors affecting the simulation results are depicted more realistically significant improvement is observed in simulating spatial flood extent in addition in predicting the water depths hydrographs of the river channel both the bare earth dem and multi error removed dem achieve poor performance it is due to the spatial resolution of dem itself which is not fine enough to represent most of the hydrologic features in the study area reconstructing the flow connectivity of river channels on the multi error removed dem increases the simulation accuracy of depth hydrographs and inundation areas with water response and vegetation response comparing with the original dem the bare earth dem and the multi error removed dem the improved model performance is a result of better representation of channel connectivity leading to better simulation of overbank flows and flow propagation from upstream channels to the outlets however simulations on the corrected dem have constantly led to overestimation of outflow volume in comparison with the observations this overestimation may result from the internal errors of srtm dem for example the srtm dem is not able to accurately capture the river and lake bathymetries below the water surface the dem only shows their corresponding water surface elevation overestimating the bottom elevation of water bodies neal et al 2012 mersel et al 2013 alfieri et al 2014 this essentially reduces the detention capacity of the water bodies and forces more water flowing to the outlets meanwhile the hydraulic correction method proposed in this work for rebuilding flow connectivity may also contribute to overestimation of outflow volume due to the lack of detailed and accurate river bottom elevation the river channels are processed according to the slope defined between the upstream point and the downstream point thus the processed channels become smoother than the original one this to certain extent may result in less water intercepted in the river channels and consequently more outflow in spite of the limitations the proposed approach has great potential for application in watersheds where high resolution dems and detailed channel cross sections are not available since the srtm dem and google earth platform is nearly globally available and the reconnection process after getting the river stream map does not require manual adjustment it provides a simple and effective approach to improve the applicability of srtm dem in 2 d hydraulic flood modeling even so we must admit that when high accuracy map of river streams is not available manual corrections and additions of networks from high resolution google earth imagery are time consuming and not realistic to do globally new methods are essential to be developed in the following studies to extract global high precision streams and reduce the processing burden of correction fortunately the previous studies aimed at extracting large scale streams from remote sensing imagery not dem data may be helpful for example orengo and petrie 2017 and isikdogan et al 2015 proposed automated methods that extract streams from remote sensing imagery isikdogan et al 2017 developed an automated river mapping engine which enables the computation of large scale streams from landsat data the streams from remote sensing imagery may be more accurate that the dem derived it can help to reduce the processing burden of correction and then more easily improve the utility of srtm dem in global flood simulation besides dems another crucial factor that may affect the performance of hydraulic model in modeling floods is related to the specification of the manning s roughness coefficient neal et al 2015 fernández et al 2016 optimizing manning s coefficient may further improve model performance specifically calibrating the manning s coefficient may have a great influence on flood arrival time and attenuation to further investigate the role of manning s coefficient in 2 d hydraulic modeling further simulations have been run but only in the sub catchments of huifa basin in order to reduce computational cost simulation results suggest that the use of different manning s coefficient does not have a big effect on the conclusions related to the performance of the four dems in supporting 2 d hydraulic modeling providing that the manning s coefficient is chosen from a reasonable range thus in this study the manning s coefficient used in the simulations is directly determined according to land cover types basin characteristics and also previous studies 4 conclusions a hydraulic correction method hcm is proposed in this study to overcome the limitations vegetation bias random errors and insufficient spatial resolution of the srtm dem in 2 d hydraulic modeling a comparative analysis is performed to investigate the simulation accuracy obtained on the original dem bare earth dem multi error removed dem and hydraulically corrected dem on the four dems an extreme flood event occurred in the 14 896 km2 huifa river basin has been systematically simulated and reproduced using the combined scs cn hydrological and 2 d hydraulic model developed in this work the modeling results indicated that a vegetation removal does not bring any obvious improvement when comparing water depth hydrographs and inundation areas with water response and vegetation response obtained from different simulations removal of height errors including vegetation bias and random errors brings obvious improvement in predicting inundation areas b the hydraulically corrected dem performs better in replicating the rising falling process of the depth hydrographs and capturing the observed peak water depth than the original dem bare earth dem and multi error removed dem c the corrected dem ensures river networks to have better flow connectivity and continuous water flow discharge along the channels this improves simulation accuracy the simulated surface water areas are better consistent with the hj imagery with the overlap ratio increasing from 0 67 original dem 0 65 bare earth dem and 0 71 multi error removed dem to 0 79 hydraulically corrected dem d overbank flow is more reliably simulated and represented on the corrected dem with well connected river networks the percent of the simulated water depth 0 2 m in the areas with vegetation response from flood has increased from 44 original dem 42 bare earth dem and 55 multi error removed dem to 61 hydraulically corrected dem

7369,digital elevation model dem is one of the most important controlling factors determining the simulation accuracy of hydraulic models however the currently available global topographic data is confronted with limitations for application in 2 d hydraulic modeling mainly due to the existence of vegetation bias random errors and insufficient spatial resolution a hydraulic correction method hcm for the srtm dem is proposed in this study to improve modeling accuracy firstly we employ the global vegetation corrected dem i e bare earth dem developed from the srtm dem to include both vegetation height and srtm vegetation signal then a newly released dem removing both vegetation bias and random errors i e multi error removed dem is employed to overcome the limitation of height errors last an approach to correct the multi error removed dem is presented to account for the insufficiency of spatial resolution ensuring flow connectivity of the river networks the approach involves a extracting river networks from the multi error removed dem using an automated algorithm in arcgis b correcting the location and layout of extracted streams with the aid of google earth platform and remote sensing imagery and c removing the positive biases of the raised segment in the river networks based on bed slope to generate the hydraulically corrected dem the proposed hcm utilizes easily available data and tools to improve the flow connectivity of river networks without manual adjustment to demonstrate the advantages of hcm an extreme flood event in huifa river basin china is simulated on the original dem bare earth dem multi error removed dem and hydraulically corrected dem using an integrated hydrologic hydraulic model a comparative analysis is subsequently performed to assess the simulation accuracy and performance of four different dems and favorable results have been obtained on the corrected dem keywords dem correction vegetation bias flow connectivity two dimensional hydraulic model srtm 1 introduction the frequent occurrence of extreme floods e g pakistan in 2010 thailand in 2011 india in 2014 china in 2016 has drawn continuous attention from the public and research communities in recent years historically flooding has been recognized as one of the main types of natural hazards in terms of economic damages and casualties dottori et al 2016 between 1980 and 2013 flooding had caused about 1 trillion direct economic losses and 220 000 fatalities re 2014 flood induced damages and causalities are widely predicted to dramatically increase due to economic development and population growth winsemius et al 2015 land use cover change saghafian et al 2008 ward et al 2008 and climate change alexander et al 2006 lu et al 2016 quintana seguí et al 2016 cheng et al 2017a b implementing more effective flood risk reduction and management strategies has become an important task for governments at different levels across the world in recent years significant efforts have been made to better understand the physical process of flooding and develop different types of models to predict flood hazard numerical mathematical models for quantifying and mapping flood hazards and risks have become effective tools in facilitating flood risk management and reducing the catastrophic impacts european commission 2007 many up to date advanced hydro system analysis methods e g discrete principal monotonicity method cheng et al 2016a b have been developed to simulate highly complicated hydrological processes which are based on the responses between input and output datasets besides the data driven models mechanism based flood models have also been developed with different levels of complexity ranging from the simplified lumped approaches distributed hydrological models to the highly detailed 2 d hydraulic models the data driven models and lumped models e g gr model perrin et al 2003 deal with the system as a whole and do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of the problem domain khakbaz et al 2012 however flooding may present clear spatial variations as influenced by localized weather and topographic conditions chen et al 2017a cheng et al 2017c d distributed hydrological models e g swat arnold et al 1998 take into account the heterogeneities in both the catchment characteristics and hydrometeorological inputs nguyen et al 2015 chen et al 2017b however they usually adopt conceptual or simplified approaches to route runoffs and flood waves khan and valeo 2016 and are incapable of representing certain common flow phenomena such as flow over flat slopes reversing flow and backwater effect kim et al 2012 this may constrain the wider application in flood risk management where detailed floodplain hydrodynamics is typically required the 2 d hydraulic models can simulate the dynamics of surface runoff across watersheds with complex topographies using minimal model parameters in accordance with continuity and momentum principles hydraulic models better depict the dynamics of flood waves and physical characteristics of the watersheds with the availability of rich sources of high resolution topographic and hydrological data and much enhanced computational power a number of 2 d hydraulic models have been successfully applied to flood simulations at the watershed scale e g neal et al 2012 paiva et al 2013 hydraulic models rely on accurate topographic data to reliably predict flooding processes over landscapes callow et al 2007 the accuracy of dem has been viewed as the most important controlling factor determining the simulation accuracy of hydraulic models bates et al 1998 sanders 2007 jarihani et al 2015 to date the shuttle radar topographic mission srtm digital elevation model dem rabus et al 2003 farr et al 2007 is thought to be the most popular and best freely available topographic data that covers most parts of the globe surface hirt et al 2010 jing et al 2014 athmania and achour 2014 sampson et al 2015 an alternative to srtm is aster the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer fujisada et al 2012 however although the spatial resolution of aster 30 m has an advantage over that of srtm 90 m srtm is more suitable for hydraulic modeling as it is distorted by fewer surface objects with higher vertical accuracy jing et al 2014 athmania and achour 2014 rexer and hirt 2014 varga and bašić 2015 chaieb et al 2016 for these reasons this study will focus on srtm dem srtm dem has been widely used for flood modeling in previous studies e g sanders 2007 samantaray et al 2015 fernández et al 2016 but all of the existing works have faced the same challenge i e how to remove the vegetation bias presented in the original srtm dem and to obtain a bare earth dem from srtm dem o loughlin et al 2016 the inability of the c band radar employed by srtm to completely penetrate the vegetation canopy to the ground has caused significant positive biases in the srtm dem brown et al 2010 thus the original srtm dem may overestimate the ground elevation in certain areas carabajal and harding 2005 lalonde et al 2010 shortridge and messina 2011 wang et al 2012 baugh et al 2013 indicated that removing the vegetation bias for srtm dem in a reach of the amazon basin clearly improved hydrodynamic modeling accuracy in terms of both water depth and inundation extent a number of other researchers have also tried to correct the vegetation bias before flood modeling however all of these existing works did not consider either the spatial variability of the vegetation height wilson et al 2007 coe et al 2010 paiva et al 2011 or the spatial variability of srtm vegetation permeation signal baugh et al 2013 pinel et al 2015 luo et al 2017 besides all of the studies mentioned above have conducted in the amazon basin so more case studies with different watershed characteristics should be further considered to better understand the problem recently the release of global forest canopy heights lefsky 2010 simard et al 2011 and other related remote sensing products has provided a desirable opportunity to enable systematic vegetation corrections for srtm dem accounting for the spatial variability of both vegetation height and srtm vegetation signal o loughlin et al 2016 combined these remote sensing datasets to correct the vegetation bias in the original srtm dem and developed the first global bare earth dem the bare earth dem showed great improvements in vertical accuracy of the vegetated areas and is openly available in this study we will first attempt to examine this utility of the bare earth dem for flood inundation modeling in a natural basin outside of the amazon basin in addition to the vegetation bias srtm dem also contains various random errors which are non negligible for flood modeling random errors can be classified by their spatial scale into speckle noise strip noise and absolute bias yamazaki et al 2017 the presence of speckle noise is one common characteristic of sar dems like srtm zandbergen 2008 mainly caused by variability of surface reflectance over flat terrain takaku et al 2016 speckle noise has the consequence of increasing slope estimates at short distances alsdorf et al 2007 falorni et al 2005 kielet al 2006 speckling generally has a negative effect on flood modeling in particular in areas of floodplain with low slopes stripe noise is a regular height undulation with a wavelength of 500 m to 100 km gallant and read 2009 tarekegn and sayama 2013 yamazaki et al 2017 the stripe noise of the srtm dem is mainly caused by uncompensated mast motion error walker et al 2007 which can cause significant errors in simulating spatial flood extent tarekegn and sayama 2013 the absolute bias can be regarded as a departure in the average elevation over a large domain typically 20 km scale yamazaki et al 2017 caused by long wavelength random residual satellite motion errors rodriguez et al 2006 the spatial pattern of absolute bias is not homogeneous because multiple data with different absolute biases were overlaid during the creation procedure of srtm dem thus it is highly necessary to eliminate multiple error components including vegetation bias and three random errors before integrating the srtm dem in flood modeling however treating multiple error components is not easy because different error components could offset each other and thus difficult to accurately recognize and estimate error magnitude fortunately yamazaki et al 2017 newly released the first global multi error removed improved terrain dem by correcting all major error components in srtm dem which shows better vertical accuracy than the original dem in this study we will simultaneously examine this utility of the bare earth dem and multi error removed dem for flood inundation modeling besides the multiple height errors the spatial resolution of global srtm dem 90 m are not fine enough to represent the small scale topographic features such as narrow river or channel networks they are the key elements for reliable depiction of watershed hydrodynamics in hydraulic models especially for the watersheds with complex terrain yamazaki et al 2012 schumann et al 2014 moreover srtm is influenced by surface artifacts such as artificial buildings which may break flow connectivity along channel networks or between the river channel and hillslope systems callow et al 2007 sanders 2007 lehner et al 2008 thus the dem needs to be pre processed to better represent hydrological characteristics particularly in places where the flow connectivity is lost various algorithms have been developed for hydrologically correcting dems it is usually considered that one of the major challenges impeding flow connectivity is the pit s i e one or more adjacent pixels with lower elevation values than its or their surrounded pixels the pit s can unphysically block water and cause disconnected flow paths kenny et al 2008 lee et al 2017 the common pit removal methods include lifting jenson and domingue 1988 carving martz and garbrecht 1999 and the combination of lifting and carving soille 2004 these pits removal algorithms are useful for improving flow connectivity in dems with high spatial resolution such as airborne lidar dems however they are not effective for the srtm dem because the elevation values of sub pixel scale hydrology features may be also lifted by surrounding objects such as bridge and building etc yamazaki et al 2012 in the aforementioned algorithms these pits are treated equally without considering whether they are real or spurious thus the corrected dems may not well represent the realistic terrains other related pre processing methods include stream burning e g lehner et al 2008 and ridge fencing e g masutomi et al 2009 etc but they also suffer from the same issue and create corrected dems that may not represent the realistic terrains yamazaki et al 2012 proposed an alternative method that treated the river networks from the hydrosheds datasets lehner et al 2008 as given information and then removed the pits of the river networks to ensure flow connectivity along the rivers lehner et al 2008 developed the river network dataset using mainly standard gis techniques the process of deriving river networks through pit filling is automated and simple in esri s arcgis software but it cannot ensure the dem derived river networks resembling the known networks kenny et al 2008 especially in those flat areas pan et al 2012 moreover when removing the pits in the river networks the parameters of the adopted weighting function for deciding the level of modification were obtained by trial and error and needed manual adjustment and they did not account for the terrain harmony between the networks and hillslopes to overcome the shortcomings of the existing dem correction methods for application of srtm dem in flood modeling there is thereby a need to develop an approach to generate new hydraulically corrected dem to support 2 d hydraulic simulation on the basis of multi error removed dem yamazaki et al 2017 we proposed a new hydraulic correction method hcm to effectively correct the dem and ensure flow connectivity along the river channel networks meanwhile the vegetation bias will be investigated using the bare earth dem developed from srtm dem by o loughlin et al 2016 accounting for the spatial variability of both vegetation height and srtm vegetation signal the multi error removed dem is also investigated to test its utility in flood inundation simulation the purpose of the current study is to identify the limitations of srtm dem in 2 d watershed hydraulic simulation and to improve its utility based on available auxiliary data and tools 2 methodology 2 1 new hydraulic correction method hcm for the srtm dem in order to correct the srtm dem to better replicate the hydrology features of a watershed and improve hydraulic flood simulation results the new hydraulic correction method hcm is proposed as a removing the vegetation bias and random errors and b ensuring flow connectivity fig 1 the bare earth dem developed is employed to account for the vegetation bias in the srtm dem the multi error removed dem yamazaki et al 2017 is adopted to investigate both the vegetation bias and random errors in this sub section the approach to ensuring flow connectivity is introduced in detail 2 1 1 generation of river networks analysis algorithms have become widely available to extract river networks from dems river networks are routinely defined as pixels with drainage areas that are greater than a threshold value in this study the preliminary networks are automatically generated from the hydrology toolboxes in arcgis e g the blue lines in fig 2 and fig 3 the preliminary networks in certain places are detected to move away from their exact locations the exact layout and location of river channels can be mapped from the high spatial resolution images 1 m obtained from the google earth platform which is accessible by the public to achieve this the preliminary networks generated from arcgis are converted into keyhole markup language kml and then overlaid on google earth the inexact parts are drawn manually on the virtual globe viewing window and then saved on a new kml file the new kml is imported into arcgis and used to replace the inexact parts i e the red lines in fig 3 it should be noted that the optimum images displayed in google earth may come from different years to ensure the networks reflecting the hydrological conditions of the specific year under consideration the corrected networks will be further compared with and verified against the hj 1a b ccd images obtained at the same time if the verification fails the networks will be corrected or supplemented again in arcgis 2 1 2 processing approach for flow connectivity after obtaining the exact positions and layouts of the river networks the river profiles are extracted from the dem for each river channel its profile consists of a series of elevation values from the most upstream point to the outlet along the flow direction an example is shown in fig 4 a and a number of obstacles impeding flow connectivity are detected in the selected river profile the line segments containing the three most obvious obstacles are marked within the blue boxes and will be further analyzed in the virtue of google earth platform for segment 1 fig 4b the channel width is narrow 15 m in this reach with a resolution of 90 m the center points of dem pixel fall outside the river and pick up the higher elevation values in the surrounding locations for example the points with elevations of 426 m 425 m 423 m and 420 m are all located in the riverbank a few points with higher elevations of 444 m 454 m and 457 m are found on the vegetated mountain as shown in fig 4b for segment 2 as shown in fig 4c the points have captured the elevation of a dam and the dam s appendages which are higher than the upstream points 383 m and seriously hinder the reservoir outflow for segment 3 as illustrated in fig 4d although the channel reach is wide enough to be captured by the dem pixels the center points of the pixels may not coincide with the central line of the river generally has a lower elevation which inevitably results in overestimation of channel elevation and subsequently reduces conveyance although there are pits in the river profile due to the white noise in the dem majority of the obstacles that impede flow connectivity have positive biases due to the surface objects or the offset of river central line in the dem herein we propose a new approach to remove the positive biases and rebuild flow connectivity for river networks the positive biases are removed by caving the raised segment to maintain a reasonable river slope and terrain harmony between the networks and hillslopes the corrected value for every raised river channel is calculated by taking into account the slope between the nearest upstream pixel and the nearest downstream pixel outside the raised segment fig 5 the slope s and correction value δ are calculated by 1 s z upstream z downstream n 1 1 2 δ i s i 3 z cor i z i δ i where n is the number of pixels contained in the raised segment under consideration z upstream and z downstream are the elevations of the nearest upstream and downstream pixels outside the raised segment z i is the elevation of pixel i before correction where i is the index of the pixels within the segment z cor i is the corresponding corrected elevation and δ i is the value to be corrected for pixel i in the previous studies dems are mainly corrected using pit removal which may excessively alter the elevations and destroy the realistic terrains without distinguishing true and false pits the correction approach proposed in this work identifies the real positive biases in the srtm dem followed by caving the positive biases of the raised segment the correction focuses on the key hydrology features river drainage networks rather than the whole basin to avoid exaggerated modification meanwhile compared with the pit removal method that required manual adjustment yamazaki et al 2012 the current approach is reinforced by the slope condition of the topography in the multi error removed dem which may better represent the realistic terrains for each river channel inside the watershed the raised segments are corrected one by one using the proposed method from upstream to downstream fig 4e this river profile correction procedure will be applied to every river and tributary until flow connectivity of the whole river network is guaranteed 2 2 integrated hydrologic hydraulic modeling to simulate the watershed scale flood evolution a 2 d hydraulic model is adopted and applied in this study however most of the existing hydraulic models are not capable of representing certain key hydrological process such as evapotranspiration interception and infiltration herein an integrated hydrologic hydraulic modeling approach is developed and used in which the surface runoff generated from a rainstorm is generated by a hydrologic model and used as inputs to drive the hydraulic model and create flooding 2 2 1 hydrologic modeling the scs cn model is adopted in this work because of its simplicity stability and success in previous studies for runoff generation mishra and singh 2007 the models consider most of key watershed characteristics related to runoff generation including land use soil type and antecedent moisture condition chen et al 2016 infiltration models such as horton and green ampt methods have been also used together with hydraulic models to predict surface runoff from intense rainfall fernández et al 2016 but these models commonly require substantial field data for model calibration and verification and are not suitable for the current study the scs cn model is designed for predicting surface runoff sr of a specified rainstorm as follows mishra and singh 1999 woodward et al 2002 4 sr p i a 2 p i a s where p is the precipitation depth s is the maximum potential retention i a is the initial abstraction defined as i a λ s with λ taken as 0 2 and s is a parameter related to the curve number cn as follows 5 s 2540 cn 25 4 cn is the only parameter in scs cn and its value determined by the watershed characteristics may be obtained from section 4 of the national engineering handbook scs 1956 it should be noted that scs cn was originally designed to compute the total runoff volume and is not a time advancing method in this study in order to generate runoff volumes that are consistent with the spatial and temporal resolution of the 2 d hydraulic model scs cn is performed at every time step and in every cell of the computational grid that decomposes the computational domain i e the watershed under consideration according to caviedes voullième et al 2012 the cumulative surface runoff for a given time is computed from the cumulative precipitation from the beginning of the rainfall event to the specific time being considered the surface runoff for a specific time step is the increment calculated by subtracting the cumulative runoff from the previous time step consistent with the spatial resolution of the available dem scs cn is implemented in every 90 m 90 m pixel inside the study area the cumulative precipitation antecedent soil moisture land use and soil type for each pixel are provided or defined at each of the pixels herein hourly cumulative precipitation that drives a simulation is estimated via interpolation from the four closest precipitation stations using the inverse distance squared weighting method antecedent soil moisture is determined from the precipitation five days before the flood land use data is available from the global land cover mapping chen et al 2015 and soil type information is derived from the harmonized world soil database nachtergaele et al 2012 2 2 2 2 d hydraulic modeling a fully dynamic hydraulic model based on the 2 d depth averaged shallow water equations is adopted in this work for flood simulations the conservative form of the governing 2 d shallow water equations is expressed as follows 6 q t f x g y s where t is the time x and y represent the cartesian coordinates q denotes the flow variable vector f and g are the flux vectors in the x and y direction respectively and s is the source term vector the vector terms are defined as q h q x q y f q x uq x 1 2 gh 2 uq y 7 g q y vq x vq y 1 2 gh 2 s 0 c f u u 2 v 2 gh z b x c f v u 2 v 2 gh z b x where h is the water depth qx uh and qy vh are the unit width discharges in the x and y directions respectively u and v denote the depth averaged velocities in two cartesian directions and zb is the bed elevation and cf is the bed roughness coefficient the above governing equations are solved using a shock capturing finite volume godunov type scheme on uniform grids detailed description of the model can be found in hou et al 2014 and xia et al 2017 to substantially improve its computational efficiency for large scale flood simulations the current model is implemented for parallelized computing on multiple gpus using nvidia s parallel computing architecture cuda compute unified device architecture a gpu accelerated model was reported to be 10 s times computationally more efficient than its counterpart running on a cpu jarihani et al 2015 the 2 d hydraulic model is set up using the available topographic and roughness data and driven by the hourly surface runoff volumes calculated by scs cn at every computational pixel the runoff is then automatically routed by the hydraulic model within the computational domain before confluence at the basin outlet the topographic data used in this work include the original dem bare earth dem multi error dem and hydraulically corrected dem roughness of the watershed is indicated by the manning coefficient n standard values of the manning coefficient corresponding to different watershed characteristics may be found from a hydraulics textbook or report e g chow 1959 barnes 1967 arcement and schneider 1984 and using these values in hydraulic modeling has become a common practice e g mtamba et al 2015 garrote et al 2016 the manning coefficients are specified according to different land use types as available from the global land cover mapping chen et al 2015 0 15 for forest 0 035 for arable land 0 03 for grassland 0 027 for water surface and 0 016 for construction land simulation results from the integrated hydrologic hydraulic model are validated against time histories of water depth measured at gauge stations and inundation extent derived from remotely sensed images water depths predicted on different dems are evaluated through comparison with gauge records predicted flood extents are compared with the flood footprints extracted from the hj 1a b imagery based on normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 and enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 2002 ndwi can effectively distinguish water signal against most of the terrestrial and soil features with ndwi classified into open water ndwi 0 and non water ndwi 0 however the open water class may not all correspond to flood footprints because certain places may quickly dry up after being flooded and do not contain open water therefore these temporally flooded areas may be missed out by ndwi leading to derivation of unreliable flood footprints evi is a widely used proxy of vegetation greenness to evaluate the terrestrial photosynthetic activity shi et al 2017 the difference between the evis before and after a flood event reflects the degree of vegetation being damaged by flood and is a useful indicator for identifying inundated areas in this work ndwi and evi are used to derive flood extents for evaluating simulation results the formulas for calculating ndwi and evi are given as follows 8 ndwi r green r nir r green r nir 9 evi 2 5 r nir r red r nir 6 r red 7 5 r blue 1 where r nir r red r green and r blue are referred as the reflectance of the near infrared red green and blue bands of hj 1a b ccd images respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 study area and the flood event a 267 km reach of the huifa river in the northeastern china fig 2 is selected as the case study approximately 33 of the total areas are covered by forests with clear spatial variation making it an ideal site for investigating the influence of vegetation bias in the original srtm dem on flood modeling the river networks are characterized by numerous tributaries and sub pixel sized channels and their representation is particularly sensitive to dem quality and important for flood modeling providing a desired case study to test the applicability of the hydraulically improved dem for use in 2 d hydraulic flood modeling detailed hydrometeorological data are available for the study site including rainfall records from 253 precipitation stations and continuous water depth measurements from 8 hydrologic stations along the main channel reach meanwhile hj 1a b ccd images are available to derive the actual flooded areas the huifa river has a basin area of 14 896 km2 and is mainly located in jilin province northeastern china the local climate is dominated by continental monsoons with an annual average of 720 mm the rainfall has a clear seasonal variation rainfall occurs mostly during summer and autumn and 44 7 of the annual total is recorded in july and august zhang et al 2012 corresponding to the seasonal rainfall variation there is a clearly defined flood season from june to september and a dry period from october to the following may according to gauge station records during 1965 2015 the mean discharge of huifa river is 83 70 m3 s and the maximum peak discharge is measured to be 3410 m3 s occurring during the flood season in 2013 the 2013 extreme flood event will be further investigated in this study in august 2013 an area average rainfall of 221 mm was recorded in the huifa river basin leading to an extreme flood event with a 50 year return period jin et al 2015 the flood caused disastrous consequences in all three northeast provinces i e heilongjiang jilin and liaoning according to the ministry of civil affairs approximately 5 million people were affected 95 people were killed 154 622 houses were damaged and 1 59 million hectares of croplands were affected hong kong red cross 2013 3 2 hydraulically corrected srtm dem using arcgis google earth and hj 1a b ccd images we acquire the exact layout and locations of the river networks in the huifa river basin fig 3 the river networks consist of a total of 312 tributaries with length ranging from 0 5 km to 267 km river networks may be quickly generated from a dem using arcgis however the resulting networks may contain obvious inaccuracies in both location and layout which may be easily detected by overlaying the derived networks with google earth imagines in flood modeling flow connectivity of the river networks is a key factor affecting the simulation results it is necessary to correct the river networks derived directly from a dem to support more reliable flood predictions the availability of google earth at high spatial resolution and hj 1a b ccd images has provided an opportunity to resolve the issue by combining arcgis google earth with the timely remote sensing images we may now accurately position river networks and improve their flow connectivity in basins of different scales herein the proposed hcm is used to ensure flow connectivity of the river networks in the huifa river basin among the 2349 401 pixels of the multi error removed dem inside the basin 37 032 pixels 1 6 pixels are identified to form raised segments breaking the flow connectivity of the river networks the amount of correction as required is less than 1 m at 14 025 pixels 38 and less than 2 m at 26 551 pixels 72 in all of the modified pixels 95 of them require correction of less than 4 m the average amount of correction is only 46 mm for the whole basin supporting material fig s1 shows the 6 main channels see in fig 2 in the study area it is observed that the overall topographic features of all 6 channels are well maintained following flow connectivity reconstruction meanwhile when the elevations of the channel pixels are adjusted to more reasonable values the exchange of flow between hillslopes and river networks may be better depicted in 2 d hydraulic modeling 3 3 validation of simulation results with in suit measured water depths to validate the flood simulation results on the four dems as considered in this work the surface runoff generated from scs cn is compared with the discharge measured in the wudaogou station near the basin outlet see supporting material fig s2 and the water depths calculated by the 2 d hydraulic model are compared with the measurements available at the eight gauge stations within the model domain see fig 2 the eight gauge stations are located along the main tributaries with contributing basin areas varying from 150 km2 to 2000 km2 table 1 the predicted and measured hourly hydrographs of water depth are shown in fig 6 for all eight stations the calculated root mean square errors rmse and the difference between the predicted and measured maximum water depths di are summarized in table 1 the total runoff volume computed from scs cn is 1 36 109 m3 the actual volume measured in the wudaogou station is 1 52 109 m3 the error between the computed and measured is approximately 11 which is acceptable this also confirms that the adopted cn numbers derived based on the watershed characteristics and previous research are reasonable the depth hydrographs calculated on the original dem represented by the red lines in fig 6 and the bare earth dem and multi error removed dem represented by yellow lines and green lines respectively in fig 6 are somehow similar with peak water depth underestimated at almost all eight stations at stations 1 2 5 and 8 the predicted depth hydrographs feature a correct rising falling process however the magnitudes of the predicted depths are not consistent with the observations and the peak water depths predicted on the original dem are approximately 0 3 m larger than those predicted on the bare earth dem this may be because the bare earth dem has lower elevation values after removing vegetation bias vegetation bias removal effectively makes the dem values to become the same level as the surrounding topography leading to more flood water detained on the hillslopes and less water discharged to stream outlets the multi error removed dem performs better in predicting the peak water depths than the original dem and the bare earth dem at stations 1 5 and 8 at stations 3 and 6 simulations on the original dem bare earth dem and multi error removed dem all predict a dry river with no water depth the correct water depth hydrograph is not reproduced because the water flow cannot move from upstream to the gauge station as a result of blocked channel and broken flow connectivity at stations 4 and 7 the water depth suddenly increases and then maintains at a constant depth this suggests that the dems have turned both of the locations to become pits as a result the flood water maintains at a constant level after the pits are quickly filled comparing the depth hydrographs predicted on the hydraulically corrected dem with those predicted on the other three dems shows that at most of the stations the corrected dem performs better in predicting the rise and fall process of water depth and peak water depth the results from the corrected dem indicate that the model has succeeded in depicting the rising falling process of the water depth at all eight stations except for stations 7 and 8 the peak water depths predicted on the corrected dem agree more closely with the observed values and higher than those predicted on the other three dems this is because the predicted water flow successfully propagates from upstream to the outlet through the connecting networks which are better represented in the corrected dem via the correcting method outlined in the previous section it needs to be noted that the simulation on the corrected dem overestimates the peak water depth at station 8 the reason may be that the river channel becomes smoothed following the dem correction process leading to reduced retention volume another possible reason may be because the storage of reservoirs is not considered in the current study the results demonstrate that improved 2 d flood modeling can be achieved by better depicting the connected channels using the hydraulic correction method as proposed in this study to process a dem 3 4 validation of simulation results with remote sensing images the inundation extent predicted by the 2 d hydraulic model is compared with the satellite observations of flood footprint obtained from the hj 1a b ccd images two hj images are used one was acquired during the flood period on 23 august 2013 and another was acquired before the flood event on 6 july 2013 based on the ndwi 0 calculated from the image during flood period the surface water area can be identified including rivers lakes and ponding areas however the surface water area may be significantly less than the actual inundation area because flood water can pass certain regions without forming open water i e boundaries of inundated areas mohammadi et al 2017 so the vegetation response is also adopted to obtain the flood footprint by identifying the changes in evi values the ratio of evis after and before the flood event is calculated for every pixel we then extract the pixels in which the vegetation has been negatively influenced by the flood event eviafter evibefore 0 35 and evibefore 0 the evi ratio of 0 35 is taken to extract the pixels that are obviously influenced by flooding the natural fluctuations e g the evi of crop may slightly decrease from before the flood event corresponding to peak growth stage to after the flood event corresponding to mature stage are excluded to ensure that pure flood footprints are acquired considering the fact that certain flood footprints may not involve either water response or vegetation response satellite observations of flood footprints from the hj 1a b ccd images cannot present all areas that are inundated by flood water we therefore separately analyze the simulation performance to reflect the water response and vegetation response for the surface water area the ratio of overlap areas roa is used to assess simulation performance in predicting open water roa is defined as the ratio between the hj and simulation overlapping area and the hj surface water area to evaluate the performance spatially we compute roa in every window containing 4 4 pixels fig 7 b d and count roa values within the 12 sub basins fig 7a and table 2 similar results are obtained for the original dem and bare earth dem simulations thus the result drawing of bare earth dem is not shown in fig 7 due to space limitation in huifa river basin vegetation removal bare earth dem shows no improvement in accuracy for predicting open water areas compared with the use of original dem instead the resulting simulation performance is observed to deteriorate in certain sub basins such as sub basin 9 and 12 on the other hand hydraulic flood simulation on the multi error removed dem shows obvious improvement in almost all sub basins the overall accuracy of predicting surface water areas against the hj image has been improved from a roa of 0 67 original dem and 0 65 bare earth dem to 0 71 multi error removed dem among all the four dems the hydraulically corrected dem performs the best in predicting surface water areas in the whole basin and all sub basins the overall accuracy of predicting surface water areas against the hj image rises to 0 79 comparison between these predicted surface water areas visually shows that simulations on the original dem and bare earth dem only correctly predict inundation in a few small areas in the midstream including the corresponding main channel and sub basins 5 6 and 11 40 whereas the simulation on the multi error removed dem and the corrected dem show a marked improvement and the corrected dem accurately predicts most of the observed water surface areas 70 this implies that well connected river networks ensure flow connectivity and lead to improved flood prediction discharge of the water flow alongside the networks to evaluate the performance of simulation results in terms of representing the vegetation response to the flood event the predicted flood map is assessed through comparison with the areas with vegetation response the pixels with vegetation response are typically located at the boundaries of open water areas which are mainly covered by grain crops according to ganji et al 2012 when the inundation depth is 0 2 m crop yield will be obviously affected so we count the percentage of the predicted maximum water depth 0 2 m in the areas with vegetation response table 3 and fig 8 the percentage of water depth 0 2 m increases from 44 predicted on the original dem and 55 on the multi error removed dem to 61 on the corrected dem for the whole basin the evidently improved prediction of flooded areas are concentrated on the downstream which indicates that better connected river networks can lead to better representation of overbank flows along the river channels 3 5 discussions the results comparison obtained from simulations on the original dem and bare earth dem shows that these dems give similar results it means that vegetation removal does not bring obvious improvement for 2 d hydraulic modeling in huifa river basin however previous related studies in amazon river basin indicated that srtm vegetation removal could greatly improve the hydrodynamic modeling accuracy wilson et al 2007 baugh et al 2013 a possible reason for the difference may be because our study area is a mountainous watershed with high vegetation i e forest is mainly distributed in areas with high slopes thus vegetation removal does not cause any major change to the relative topographic conditions e g the average slope of basin only changes from 5 78 to 5 70 after vegetation removal subsequently vegetation removal does not impose significant change to the flow connectivity between hillslopes and river channels this is the reason that we do not focus more on vegetation removal method in this study and just use a generated data set meanwhile in comparison with the amazon river basin the current study area consists of relatively fragmented fields and this may also be another reason for the limited improvement in the simulation accuracy the bare earth dem o loughlin et al 2016 was obtained from the 250 m modis vegetation continuous field product dimiceli et al 2011 as a proxy of vegetation signal and the 1 km global vegetation height map simard et al 2011 the resolution of these vegetation data may be capable of capturing the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation height in amazon floodplain covered by more uniformly distributed rainforests but is may be too coarse for the huifa basin with smaller fields and different types of forests zhang et al 2008 therefore the necessity of vegetation removal for srtm dem in 2 d hydraulic modeling should be considered together with the specific watershed conditions of the study area under consideration more research case studies need to be done to examine the applicability and performance of bare earth dem in 2 d flood modeling although vegetation bias removal does not bring improvement for 2 d hydraulic modeling the multi error removed dem achieves obvious improvement in predicting inundation areas with water response and vegetation response we find that the flatness of the topography in flat areas floodplain is recovered well to some extent moreover some abnormal bulges and depressions in river stream have been removed and thus the flow connectivity of streams have been improved compared to the original dem and the bare earth dem thus the flow connectivity inside the floodplains and the river networks as key factors affecting the simulation results are depicted more realistically significant improvement is observed in simulating spatial flood extent in addition in predicting the water depths hydrographs of the river channel both the bare earth dem and multi error removed dem achieve poor performance it is due to the spatial resolution of dem itself which is not fine enough to represent most of the hydrologic features in the study area reconstructing the flow connectivity of river channels on the multi error removed dem increases the simulation accuracy of depth hydrographs and inundation areas with water response and vegetation response comparing with the original dem the bare earth dem and the multi error removed dem the improved model performance is a result of better representation of channel connectivity leading to better simulation of overbank flows and flow propagation from upstream channels to the outlets however simulations on the corrected dem have constantly led to overestimation of outflow volume in comparison with the observations this overestimation may result from the internal errors of srtm dem for example the srtm dem is not able to accurately capture the river and lake bathymetries below the water surface the dem only shows their corresponding water surface elevation overestimating the bottom elevation of water bodies neal et al 2012 mersel et al 2013 alfieri et al 2014 this essentially reduces the detention capacity of the water bodies and forces more water flowing to the outlets meanwhile the hydraulic correction method proposed in this work for rebuilding flow connectivity may also contribute to overestimation of outflow volume due to the lack of detailed and accurate river bottom elevation the river channels are processed according to the slope defined between the upstream point and the downstream point thus the processed channels become smoother than the original one this to certain extent may result in less water intercepted in the river channels and consequently more outflow in spite of the limitations the proposed approach has great potential for application in watersheds where high resolution dems and detailed channel cross sections are not available since the srtm dem and google earth platform is nearly globally available and the reconnection process after getting the river stream map does not require manual adjustment it provides a simple and effective approach to improve the applicability of srtm dem in 2 d hydraulic flood modeling even so we must admit that when high accuracy map of river streams is not available manual corrections and additions of networks from high resolution google earth imagery are time consuming and not realistic to do globally new methods are essential to be developed in the following studies to extract global high precision streams and reduce the processing burden of correction fortunately the previous studies aimed at extracting large scale streams from remote sensing imagery not dem data may be helpful for example orengo and petrie 2017 and isikdogan et al 2015 proposed automated methods that extract streams from remote sensing imagery isikdogan et al 2017 developed an automated river mapping engine which enables the computation of large scale streams from landsat data the streams from remote sensing imagery may be more accurate that the dem derived it can help to reduce the processing burden of correction and then more easily improve the utility of srtm dem in global flood simulation besides dems another crucial factor that may affect the performance of hydraulic model in modeling floods is related to the specification of the manning s roughness coefficient neal et al 2015 fernández et al 2016 optimizing manning s coefficient may further improve model performance specifically calibrating the manning s coefficient may have a great influence on flood arrival time and attenuation to further investigate the role of manning s coefficient in 2 d hydraulic modeling further simulations have been run but only in the sub catchments of huifa basin in order to reduce computational cost simulation results suggest that the use of different manning s coefficient does not have a big effect on the conclusions related to the performance of the four dems in supporting 2 d hydraulic modeling providing that the manning s coefficient is chosen from a reasonable range thus in this study the manning s coefficient used in the simulations is directly determined according to land cover types basin characteristics and also previous studies 4 conclusions a hydraulic correction method hcm is proposed in this study to overcome the limitations vegetation bias random errors and insufficient spatial resolution of the srtm dem in 2 d hydraulic modeling a comparative analysis is performed to investigate the simulation accuracy obtained on the original dem bare earth dem multi error removed dem and hydraulically corrected dem on the four dems an extreme flood event occurred in the 14 896 km2 huifa river basin has been systematically simulated and reproduced using the combined scs cn hydrological and 2 d hydraulic model developed in this work the modeling results indicated that a vegetation removal does not bring any obvious improvement when comparing water depth hydrographs and inundation areas with water response and vegetation response obtained from different simulations removal of height errors including vegetation bias and random errors brings obvious improvement in predicting inundation areas b the hydraulically corrected dem performs better in replicating the rising falling process of the depth hydrographs and capturing the observed peak water depth than the original dem bare earth dem and multi error removed dem c the corrected dem ensures river networks to have better flow connectivity and continuous water flow discharge along the channels this improves simulation accuracy the simulated surface water areas are better consistent with the hj imagery with the overlap ratio increasing from 0 67 original dem 0 65 bare earth dem and 0 71 multi error removed dem to 0 79 hydraulically corrected dem d overbank flow is more reliably simulated and represented on the corrected dem with well connected river networks the percent of the simulated water depth 0 2 m in the areas with vegetation response from flood has increased from 44 original dem 42 bare earth dem and 55 multi error removed dem to 61 hydraulically corrected dem
