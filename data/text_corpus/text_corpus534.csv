2670,a seaward decrease increase decrease trend in the longitudinal bed level defined as scour bar pattern is observed in several large estuaries on low lying coastal plains such as the amazon yangtze and fly why this pattern forms has not yet been well explained the mechanism for the formation of this pattern is explored here using a one dimensional morphodynamic model with varied geometry fluvial water discharge sediment flux and tide results show that for those estuaries with bed slopes in the order of 10 5 and sediment concentration in the order of 0 1 kg m 3 bars are likely to occur for channels with relatively weak convergence and wide mouth while scours are nearly ubiquitous scours are classified as fluvial and tidal based on the relative strength of river and tide which can be distinguished by bed slope and water depth a balance between river and tide can lead to no scours or bars sediment reduction and sea level rise enhances the relative strength of tide and transition of a fluvial scour to a tidal scour may occur keywords bed profile fluvial discharge sediment supply tide sea level rise equilibrium data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction estuary is the key link between river and sea for the transport of freshwater and sediment many large estuaries with the highest water and sediment fluxes locate on low lying coastal plains and have a funnel shape fig 1 and table 1 for instance the yangtze amazon and fly gugliotta and saito 2019 they play an important role in global water cycles and sediment budget and offer resources for human settlement transportation fisheries and agriculture for these large low lying estuaries the width generally converges landward and overall the longitudinal bed level has a seaward decrease increase trend i e a scour pattern zheng et al 2018 gugliotta et al 2017 canestrelli et al 2014 gallo and vinzon 2005 kästner et al 2017 apart from the decrease increase trend in the longitudinal bed level a closer look shows that the downstream bed level can actually decrease again forming a scour bar pattern fig 1 understanding the morphological characteristics of these estuaries is of great importance for their long term management and sustainable development especially under the risks of both upstream human intervention such as damming syvitski 2005 mei et al 2021 and downstream sea level rise nicholls and cazenave 2010 oppenheimer et al 2019 finotello et al 2019 the width of estuaries has been explored extensively davies and woodroffe 2010 lanzoni and d alpaos 2015 dronkers 2017 nienhuis et al 2018 while studies on the longitudinal bed profile are relatively less leuven et al 2021 several studies have been conducted to investigate the bed profiles of rivers or estuaries todeschini et al 2008 bolla pittaluga et al 2014 blom et al 2016 2017 viparelli and eke 2021 in which the first study neglected river discharge and the rest focused on rivers with no tides in todeschini et al 2008 a one dimensional numerical model was used to investigate the long term morphodynamics of tide dominated estuaries without river discharge and a bar is formed if the length of the estuary exceeds a threshold value bolla pittaluga et al 2014 employed a one dimensional analytical model to understand the mechanisms of morphodynamic equilibrium of short rivers with fixed banks in which they observed a scour in the channel with an exponentially varying channel width blom et al 2016 2017 explored the equilibrium river profile of channels with fixed banks that accounts for particle abrasion and grain size selection under steady and variable flows respectively while no scours or bars were observed viparelli and eke 2021 further considered unfixed channel width and the predicted channel geometry is comparable with a channel with a relative large bed slope o 1 0 4 with respect to those low lying coastal plains while the longitudinal bed pattern was not explored for those large estuaries the river discharge is usually large gugliotta and saito 2019 and can significantly affect the estuarine morphodynamics guo et al 2014 and even a micro tide can alter the water level gradient and flow velocity during the river flood maselli et al 2020 thus the role of both the river discharge and tides in shaping the estuarine bed profile may not be overlooked while understanding the morphodynamic characteristics of these tidal reaches is still a contemporary challenge especially under sea level rise hoitink and jay 2016 the formation of the estuarine scour bar pattern has not yet been adequately explained and how this pattern would react to changes in sediment supply and sea level is unclear although the pattern has been reproduced by one dimensional morphodynamic models in several studies canestrelli et al 2014 bolla pittaluga et al 2015 guo et al 2016 yuan et al 2020 it is yet unknown how its generation is affected by the fluvial water and sediment fluxes tidal strength and channel geometry that link to the river and tide dominance canestrelli et al 2014 investigated the long term morphodynamics of the bed profile of a tide dominated estuary under a constant river discharge and its sensitivity to the sediment supply they confirmed that under the one dimensional configuration the estuary reaches equilibrium and a decrease in the sediment supply leads to deepening of the channel bolla pittaluga et al 2015 explored the sensitivity of morphodynamic characteristics of tidally dominated estuaries to the channel shape tidal amplitude river discharge and sediment supply their focus was on the tidal length in relatively small estuaries tens of kilometers with large equivalent sediment concentrations 1 kg m 3 estimated as the ratio of total sediment flux to water discharge in guo et al 2016 they focused on the effect of multiple tidal constituents and varying river discharge on large scale estuarine morphodynamics yuan et al 2020 explored the role of sediment supply and sea level rise on the equilibrium transition of a large estuary leuven et al 2021 studied the estuarine longitudinal bed profiles with strong tides and relatively large equivalent sediment concentrations 0 5 kg m 3 they observed only scours as the scour bar pattern did not occur and the observation of scours in river dominated systems like the mississippi lamb et al 2012 was not explained note that for those large low lying estuaries the bed material is generally sand with a grain size larger than 0 063 mm luo et al 2012 canestrelli et al 2014 and the sediment concentration that contributes to the bed evolution generally takes a small portion of the total suspended load which is in the order of 0 1 kg m 3 milliman and farnsworth 2011 for instance sand fraction of the total suspended load is 20 for the yangtze yuan et al 2020 5 15 for the amazon nittrouer et al 2021 and 10 30 for the fly canestrelli et al 2014 the resulting sediment concentration for bed evolution in these large estuaries is generally smaller than those used in the model in bolla pittaluga et al 2015 and leuven et al 2021 herein the longitudinal scour bar pattern in large convergent estuaries on low lying coastal plains is explored more specifically the research question is what are the governing factors channel geometry fluvial water and sediment fluxes and tidal strength for the formation of the scour bar pattern in these systems from river dominated to tide dominated the answer to the question will improve the understanding of the general morphological characteristics of these large estuaries which play an important role in the global water and sediment cycle for their large water and sediment fluxes to answer the question a one dimensional morphodynamic model is employed yuan et al 2020 a funnel shaped channel is used which varies in the width and convergence and a range of values of water and sediment flux and tidal amplitude are considered the use of such a simplified model and settings is inspired by the success of simulating the equilibrium bed profiles of estuaries using similar models canestrelli et al 2014 guo et al 2016 leuven et al 2021 the equilibrium state i e no net changes in the bed level in a tidal period is used to examine the characteristics of the longitudinal bed profiles note that the aim here is trying to reproduce and explain the general trend in the longitudinal bed profile of these large estuaries rather than reproducing exactly the present day observed bed level a thorough calibration of long term modeling against field data is almost impossible for reasons like the large timescale of morphodynamic evolution during which forcing conditions may change todeschini et al 2008 nonetheless efforts are made to examine to what extend the model can capture the variation of longitudinal bed levels in reality by comparing the model results with the observation of several estuaries in addition the effect of changes in the riverine sediment supply and sea level on the scour bar pattern is also discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 model the delft3d model lesser et al 2004 is used to explore the longitudinal bed profiles of large estuaries the model solves the shallow water equations for the water flow and the exner equation for the bed level evolution with a morphodynamic acceleration factor to speed up the morphodynamics roelvink 2006 the engelund hansen formulation engelund and hansen 1967 is used for modeling the total sediment transport simplifications include the use of a funnel shaped channel with fixed river banks rectangular cross sections a constant river discharge a single semi diurnal tidal component and a single grain size canestrelli et al 2014 bolla pittaluga et al 2015 leuven et al 2021 fig 2 shows the sketch of the channel the active width b of the channel is assumed to increase exponentially from river to sea which satisfies 1 b b r b e b r exp l x l c here b r is the river width extending infinitely upstream b e is the mouth width l is the channel length l c is the convergence length and x is the seaward distance from the upstream channel boundary the width at river head x 0 approximately equals b r as l is several times larger than l c for all the considered cases a larger l c means a smoother landward decrease in width i e weaker convergence and vise versa the engelund hansen formulation is a total load formulation which reads 2 q s 0 05 u 5 g c 3 δ 2 d here q s is the volumetric sediment flux per unit width u is the longitudinal velocity g is the gravitational acceleration c is the chézy coefficient δ ρ s ρ 1 1 65 is the immersed relative density with ρ s and ρ being the density of sediment and water respectively and d is the characteristic grain size a constant c of 60 m 1 2 s 1 is used which is similar to studies of long term morphodynamics of large estuaries guo et al 2014 leuven et al 2021 a grain size of 0 1 mm is chosen which is approximately the median grain size of the bed material of large estuaries such as the yangtze and fly luo et al 2012 canestrelli et al 2014 in this study to describe the discharge related total sediment flux an equivalent sediment concentration is defined as the ratio of the total sediment flux to water discharge by analogy with the suspended sediment concentration this concept is useful for comparison between systems with significant differences in their water discharge and total sediment flux an equilibrium sediment concentration is used to describe the equivalent sediment concentration at the equilibrium state at the river head calculated as c s ρ s q s 0 q 0 in which q s 0 b q s is the total sediment flux at the equilibrium state and q 0 is the specified water discharge at the river head 2 2 initial and boundary conditions the initial water level is set to 0 everywhere and the initial bed level changed linearly from a given value at the river head to 10 m at the seaward boundary at the seaward boundary a semi diurnal tide with a period of 12 h is prescribed and the sediment flux is determined by the local flow zero gradient at the river head a constant water discharge q 0 and a zero gradient condition for the sediment flux are used thus the bed level at the river head with respect to the mean sea level z r is nearly fixed given the same river discharge tidal amplitude and channel geometry under the zero gradient sediment transport condition the bed slope is automatically adjusted and in general a lower bed level at the river head i e a smaller z r corresponds to a smaller sediment flux in equilibrium canestrelli et al 2014 yuan et al 2020 for such a setting sensitivity tests using different sediment transport formulations van rijn 1984a b c 1993 result in quite similar bed profiles as the engelund hansen formulation fig s1a in supplement albeit the equilibrium sediment flux differs but remaining in the same order 2 3 design of the numerical experiments table 2 shows the setup of the numerical experiments six parameters are varied to explore the sensitivity of the longitudinal profiles to channel geometry strength of river and tide they are the channel width at the river head b r 0 5 2 km and mouth b e 4 24 km convergence length l c 1 3 times of b e river discharge q 0 6000 40000 m 3 s 1 bed level at river head z r 1 25 m to 10 m and tidal amplitude a 0 0 6 1 8 m each parameter takes 3 values except b e 5 values thus in total 1215 cases are conducted the range of the upstream and downstream widths b r and b e water discharge q 0 bed level at river head with respect to still sea level z r and tidal amplitude a 0 are roughly based on the large estuaries shown in gugliotta and saito 2019 the convergence length is set to 1 to 3 times of the width at the mouth b e this is inspired by the observation of the yangtze amazon fly and 18 other estuaries b e 1000 m shown in gisen and savenije 2015 in which the majority have a convergence length smaller than 3 times of b e see table s1 in supplement note that the cases in which only the bed level at river head z r is varied represent variations in the sediment flux for all these experiments the model domain is set to 600 km which is discretized into 400 grid cells and the time step is set to 4 minutes sensitivity tests show that the morphodynamic acceleration factor has little effect on the model results fig s1b thus a factor of 200 is chosen sensitivity tests for the chézy coefficient and the grain size are also conducted it shows that for a given setup the grain size has minor effects on the equilibrium bed profile fig s1c decreasing the chézy coefficient results in increased bottom friction for the same water depth the effects of which on the bed profile is similar to increasing the tidal amplitude at the mouth fig s1d it has been shown that an equilibrium state of estuaries will be reached using one dimensional morphodynamic models which is characterized by an unchanged tidally averaged bed level that is not sensitive to the initial condition canestrelli et al 2014 leuven et al 2021 the equilibrium state is used to examine the characteristics of the longitudinal bed profiles here a scour is defined as a local minimum of the bed level and a bar as a local maximum the tidal influence on the river boundary is considered to be negligible if the amplitude of the semi diurnal tide is smaller than a quarter of the specified value at the sea boundary in total 98 of the cases in table 2 satisfy this condition table 3 3 results 3 1 occurrence of longitudinal scours and bars scours are observed for almost all the considered cases while bars are more likely to develop for a relatively large convergence length and wide mouth table 3 for instance for the upstream channel width b r of 0 5 km bars are observed for a mouth width b e no less than 6 km and the number of bars increases as b e increases l c also increases as it is set to 1 3 b e for the considered tests 81 tests for each value of b e examples of the longitudinal scour bar pattern are presented in fig 3 where the modeled tidally averaged bed level z b in equilibrium is shown for the experiments in which the channel widths are 2 and 20 km at the river and sea ends respectively left column fig 3a b c shows z b for varying water discharge q 0 and tidal amplitude a 0 with a fixed bed level at river head z r 2 5 m right column fig 3d e f shows z b for varying convergence length l c and z r representing varying sediment flux with a fixed discharge q 0 40 000 m 3 s 1 scours occur for almost all the experiments in fig 3 except a few cases with a convergence length of 60 km in fig 3c red solid and green dashed lines and in fig 3f red dotted line from the left column of fig 3 it is seen that a larger tidal amplitude induces a deeper scour lines of the same type as was observed in leuven et al 2021 while a larger discharge does not necessarily lead to a deeper scour lines of the same color from the right column of fig 3 generally as the convergence length increases weaker convergence the scour shifts seaward and becomes shallower lines of the same color moreover for a smaller z r correspondingly a smaller sediment flux the bed profile is overall lowered lines of the same type bars can occur for both relatively weak and strong tides for relatively weak tides as tidal amplitude a 0 increases the location of the bar slightly shifts landward comparing blue and red dashed lines in figs 3b and c increases in a 0 can lead to the absence of bar and scour and an even further increase in a 0 can result in scour and bar again solid lines in fig 3c the same occurs for decreasing river discharge green lines in fig 3c or sediment flux dotted lines in fig 3f for a fixed relatively large tidal amplitude these findings are explained in term of fluvial and tidal strength in section 4 1 3 2 statistic of longitudinal scours and bars fig 4 shows the occurrence of the scour and scour bar patterns in the parameter space including the convergence length l c equilibrium sediment concentration c s bed slope at river head s r distance of the scour l s c o u r and bar l b a r to the mouth fig 4a shows that the scour bar pattern occurs for relatively large convergence length and the resulting equilibrium sediment concentration generally ranges in 0 01 0 3 kg m 3 the modeled bed slope s r is generally in the range of 0 5 1 0 5 to 4 1 0 5 fig 4b a close relationship between l s c o u r and l c is observed fig 4c i e generally the distance of the scour to the mouth is within 2 5 7 times of the convergence length 0 400 km the location of the bar ranges between 0 to 200 km from the mouth fig 4d for those large estuaries on low lying coastal plains the observed bed slope is usually small i e in the order of 10 5 the sediment concentration that contribute to the bed evolution in those estuaries is in the order of 0 1 kg m 3 canestrelli et al 2014 leuven et al 2021 the location of the observed scours is 100 300 km from the mouth and the bars are within 100 km from the mouth fig 1 these values fall in the range of those from the above numerical experiments generally 0 400 km from the mouth for scours and 0 200 km for bars figs 4c d 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism for the formation of longitudinal scour bar pattern longitudinal scours and bars are observed for both relatively weak and strong tides in the absence of tides the analytical equilibrium state using the engelund hansen formulation is derived in appendix a the scour and bar patterns can be examined by the bed slope in equilibrium the bed slope s is written as 3 s d z b d x d ζ d x d d d x s f r i s d with 4 s f r i u 2 d c 2 s d d d d x here ζ is the surface level and d is the water depth s f r i and s d are the bed slope terms related to friction and water depth respectively for the considered experiments the average velocity is in the order of 1 m s 1 and the average water depth is around 10 m which gives a froude number in the order of 0 1 thus the advection term contributed to the gradient of ζ is neglected as it is much smaller than the terms on the right hand side of eq 3 see fig s2 for example for a funnel shaped channel eq 1 it is derived from the analytical solution in appendix a and eq 4 that 5 s f r i c 2 q 0 2 5 k d c s ρ s 3 5 b 2 5 s d 4 5 q 0 4 5 k d c s ρ s 1 5 b 9 5 b b r l c 1 here c s is the equilibrium sediment concentration and k 20 g c 3 δ 2 is a coefficient the term s f r i is always negative and its magnitude increases monotonically seaward while s d is always positive and its magnitude increases from 0 at river head to its maximum at b 2 25 b r and next decreases seaward appendix a thus the bed slope near the river head is mainly related to s f r i and is negative seaward decrease at a scour or a bar the bed slope is 0 and thus the necessary condition for the presence of the scour bar pattern is that s 0 or s d s f r i 1 has no less than two solutions the term s d s f r i increases from 0 at river head to its maximum value at b 11 b r 6 appendix a and the above necessary condition gives 6 s d s f r i b 11 b r 6 4 5 c 2 q 0 6 5 k d c s ρ s 4 5 5 b r 6 11 b r 6 11 5 1 l c 1 7 s d s f r i b e 4 5 c 2 q 0 6 5 k d c s ρ s 4 5 b e b r b e 11 5 1 l c 1 it means that as the channel width b increases from b r to 11 b r 6 seawards the bed slope s at the equilibrium state increases from negative to positive s d s f r i thus a scour occurs in between as b continues increasing seawards s decreases and becomes negative at the river mouth s d s f r i thus a bar occurs between 11 b r 6 and b e these equations reveal that the presence of scours and bars is closely related to water discharge sediment flux and the geometry for conditions with no or weak tides eq 6 can be used to predict the presence of scour and with eq 7 the occurrence of bar can be predicted for a bar to develop the upper and lower limits of the convergence length l c can be estimated by eq 6 and eq 7 respectively for a given channel with fixed width at river head and river discharge the upper limit of l c is fixed and a wider mouth gives a wider range of l c for the occurrence of bar larger b e in eq 7 this is confirmed by analytical solutions fig s3 in supplement to illustrate the occurrence of scours and bars fig 5 shows tidally averaged bed level z b water depth d and the corresponding bed slope terms from numerical experiments as in fig 3c in the absence of tides blue lines in fig 5 almost overlapped by red lines as the channel diverges seaward the water depth d decreases figs 5b g l the magnitude of s f r i inversely proportional to d see eq 4 increases figs 5e j o and s d first increases figs 5d i n leading to s 0 that corresponds to the scour figs 5c h m as the channel width continues increasing s d decreases which could result in s 0 that corresponds to the bar figs 5c h m the presence of tides modifies the appearance of the above river dominated scours and bars for a relatively weak tide a 0 0 6 m red lines in fig 5 the water depth is quite similar to the cases with a 0 0 except near the estuary mouth where d is increased comparing red with blue lines in figs 5b g l correspondingly near the mouth s d becomes smaller and even negative seaward increase in d and s f r i becomes smaller as the tidal strength increases the tidal influence extends more upstream accompanied by increases in d both s f r i and s d decrease with more significant changes in the latter e g figs 5n o resulting in the landward shift of the bar e g fig 5k as the tidal strength continues increasing a balance between river and tide can be achieved for which the scour and bar disappear green line in fig 5a and orange line in fig 5f the downstream depth becomes similar to that in the upstream river dominated reach green line in fig 5b and orange line in fig 5g correspondingly s d decreases such that no intersection between s d and s f r i occurs green line in fig 5c and orange line in fig 5h thus the bed slope becomes always negative along the channel leading to the absence of scour bar pattern a further increase in the tidal strength can lead to the formation of scour again the so called tide dominated scour and possibly a bar close to the mouth as well orange line in fig 5a the depth generally first increases and next decreases may increase again i e negative s d in the seaward direction orange line in fig 5b correspondingly s d has a complex decrease increase decrease pattern negative to positive and may to negative again e g orange lines in figs 5d i moreover downstream of the river dominated reach s f r i decreases as the water depth increases resulting in the seaward shift of the scour fig 5a 4 2 fluvial scours versus tidal scours the above analysis illustrates that scours can be classified as river and tide dominated i e fluvial and tidal scours e g fig 5a depending on the relative strength of river and tide that relates to water and sediment discharge tidal amplitude and geometry a clear distinction between fluvial and tidal scours is that for fluvial scours the bed slope upstream of the scour s s is no larger than that in the upstream river dominated reach s r while for tidal scours s s is larger than s r fig 5c thus the bed slope can be used as an indicator for the river or tide dominance another difference is that for fluvial scours the near scour water depth is smaller than that in the upstream river dominated reach while the opposite is true for tidal scours fig 5b and fig s4 in supplement in bolla pittaluga et al 2015 the scour bar pattern with fluvial scours is observed in a relatively small estuary with and without the presence of tides fig 13 therein the channel is 50 km long with a convergence length of 2 2 km the width increases from 182 m at the river head to 2093 m at the river mouth and the river discharge is 1000 m3 s 1 with an equivalent sediment concentration of 0 94 kg m 3 the pattern disappears for convergence lengths of 4 3 and 6 5 km or a rectangular channel for the same settings as the above case eqs 6 and 7 show that the scour bar pattern occurs for a convergence length approximately in the range of 1 4 km in their case as the sediment flux is large the bed slope is also relatively large 10 4 this observation is consistent with the finding reported in the present study showing that the scour bar pattern can develop with and without tides moreover it implies that this pattern can occur in small estuaries as well and eqs 6 and 7 can be used to predict its occurrence examples of fluvial scours may include that in the lowermost mississippi lamb et al 2012 from its bed slope and seaward divergent channel near the mouth tidal scours observed here are similar to those in leuven et al 2021 in terms of slope and depth their focus was on scours that occur with a relatively strong tide and large equivalent sediment concentration 0 45 kg m 3 for the above setting in bolla pittaluga et al 2015 resulting in a large bed slope 10 4 in that study a dimensionless parameter ψ max q t i d e q r i v e r b e b r l c was employed to identify the occurrence of scour with q t i d e and q r i v e r being the tidal and river discharge per unit width at the mouth and river head respectively in their experiments generally the location of scours corresponds to the peak q t i d e q r i v e r and scours develop for ψ 0 3 it means that a strong tide and small convergence length strong convergence would favor the formation of tidal scours here the location of tidal scours is at the peak q t i d e q r i v e r or slightly upstream while tidal scours can occur for ψ 0 3 as well fig s5 in supplement thus ψ 0 3 could be sufficient but not necessary for the presence of tidal scours in the cases with no scours or bars here generally ψ falls in the range of 0 2 0 3 examples of tidal scours may include the besar distributary of the kapuas river in indonesia kästner et al 2017 from its larger bed slope and water depth at the scour than the upstream reach the scour in the amazon estuary was viewed to be tidal leuven et al 2021 using an idealized channel eq 1 with simplified parameters based on the amazon can result in the scour bar pattern fig 6 and the scour seems to be fluvial from the observed bed slope the studies which account for the river discharge bolla pittaluga et al 2014 blom et al 2016 2017 give similar formulations for the friction related bed slope s f r i as in eq 5 however they may not explain the longitudinal variation of the bed slope in the presence of tides which is important especially for cases where tides are dominant leuven et al 2021 for studies that consider both tides and river discharge bolla pittaluga et al 2015 leuven et al 2021 the estimation of the sediment concentration that contributes to the bed evolution for the small estuary 0 45 0 94 kg m 3 may be too large for those large estuaries the present model employs a zero gradient sediment flux at the river head the same as guo et al 2016 which does not require the sediment flux to be specified explicitly this is the main reason why the model results are insensitive to the sediment transport formulation and the grain size as the sediment flux is automatically adjusted according to the hydrodynamic condition at the river head this could be quite useful for estuaries with little information of sediment given the upstream bed level river discharge tidal amplitude and channel geometry the model can be used to estimate the equilibrium sediment flux and predict the equilibrium estuarine bed profile 4 3 comparison with field data experiments are conducted to further quantify the similarity between the model results and the observation of several estuaries field data of three estuaries including the yangtze yuan et al 2020 mississippi lamb et al 2012 and besar kästner et al 2017 are collected table 4 shows the model setup of river discharge tide and grain size for these estuaries and fig 7 shows the modeled equilibrium bed profiles in general the model results reproduce the longitudinal variation of the bed level reasonably well given such simplified configurations the correlation coefficient c c and the relative mean absolute error r m a e see formulations in supplement are used to evaluate the model performance from table 4 it is seen that for the settings the correlation coefficient for the yangtze is above 0 60 and reaches 0 90 for the mississippi and besar use of medium and high river discharge for the yangtze and mississippi gives good 0 2 r m a e 0 4 and excellent r m a e 0 2 model performance respectively and overall the model performance is reasonable 0 4 r m a e 0 7 for the besar for the besar the used discharge is based on the value of the upstream station herawati et al 2018 while several tributaries are present along the main channel of the besar thus the discharge used here might be larger than reality and a smaller discharge e g 1000 m 3 s 1 with the present setting for the besar can give a better model performance 4 4 implications large estuaries on low lying coastal plains and their surroundings can supply habitats for millions of people and important waterway for transportation and shipping they are facing both human intervention and climate change including decreases in the sediment supply due to dam operation and sea level rise knowing how the longitudinal bed profile of estuaries will react to those changes would be beneficial for management and planning of these systems bolla pittaluga et al 2014 arkesteijn et al 2021 sediment reduction leads to overall erosion of the estuary and sea level rise gives rise to local increase in the water depth near the mouth yuan et al 2020 in both cases the tidal effect is strengthened which has been illustrated with the tidal residual sediment flux and the landward shift of the fluvial marine transition zone decreases in the sediment supply smaller z r lead to an overall lowering of the bed level comparing lines of the same type in figs 3d e f and fig 6 and transition of scour from fluvial to tidal could occur e g dotted lines in fig 3f sea level rise can also induce changes in the scour type as the tidal influence extends more upstream see the example in fig 8 the opposite could occur for increases in sediment supply and sea level fall lambeck et al 2002 the characteristics of these scours would be helpful in explaining the historical dominance of river and tide from the longitudinal stratigraphy 5 conclusions longitudinal scour and bar patterns are observed in large convergent estuaries on low lying coastal plains a one dimensional morphodynamic model is used to explain these characteristics fluvial water discharge sediment flux tide and channel geometry are shown to be important in developing and shaping scours and bars for those low lying systems bars favor channels with relatively weak convergence and wide mouth while scours normally occur scours are classified as fluvial and tidal which can be detected from the longitudinal patterns of bed slope and water depth fluvial scours are characterized by a similar bed slope upstream of the scour and a smaller water depth with respect to those at the river head while tidal scours are characterized by larger bed slope and water depth with respect to those at the river head a balance between river and tide can lead to no scours or bars with global sediment reduction and sea level rise a shallow fluvial scour could transit to a deep tidal scour as the tidal influence extends more upstream credit authorship

decreases towards the river mouth if b e 2 25 b r a scour and a bar correspond to a local minimum and a local maximum of the bed level respectively which means that the bed slope there is zero thus

2670,a seaward decrease increase decrease trend in the longitudinal bed level defined as scour bar pattern is observed in several large estuaries on low lying coastal plains such as the amazon yangtze and fly why this pattern forms has not yet been well explained the mechanism for the formation of this pattern is explored here using a one dimensional morphodynamic model with varied geometry fluvial water discharge sediment flux and tide results show that for those estuaries with bed slopes in the order of 10 5 and sediment concentration in the order of 0 1 kg m 3 bars are likely to occur for channels with relatively weak convergence and wide mouth while scours are nearly ubiquitous scours are classified as fluvial and tidal based on the relative strength of river and tide which can be distinguished by bed slope and water depth a balance between river and tide can lead to no scours or bars sediment reduction and sea level rise enhances the relative strength of tide and transition of a fluvial scour to a tidal scour may occur keywords bed profile fluvial discharge sediment supply tide sea level rise equilibrium data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction estuary is the key link between river and sea for the transport of freshwater and sediment many large estuaries with the highest water and sediment fluxes locate on low lying coastal plains and have a funnel shape fig 1 and table 1 for instance the yangtze amazon and fly gugliotta and saito 2019 they play an important role in global water cycles and sediment budget and offer resources for human settlement transportation fisheries and agriculture for these large low lying estuaries the width generally converges landward and overall the longitudinal bed level has a seaward decrease increase trend i e a scour pattern zheng et al 2018 gugliotta et al 2017 canestrelli et al 2014 gallo and vinzon 2005 kästner et al 2017 apart from the decrease increase trend in the longitudinal bed level a closer look shows that the downstream bed level can actually decrease again forming a scour bar pattern fig 1 understanding the morphological characteristics of these estuaries is of great importance for their long term management and sustainable development especially under the risks of both upstream human intervention such as damming syvitski 2005 mei et al 2021 and downstream sea level rise nicholls and cazenave 2010 oppenheimer et al 2019 finotello et al 2019 the width of estuaries has been explored extensively davies and woodroffe 2010 lanzoni and d alpaos 2015 dronkers 2017 nienhuis et al 2018 while studies on the longitudinal bed profile are relatively less leuven et al 2021 several studies have been conducted to investigate the bed profiles of rivers or estuaries todeschini et al 2008 bolla pittaluga et al 2014 blom et al 2016 2017 viparelli and eke 2021 in which the first study neglected river discharge and the rest focused on rivers with no tides in todeschini et al 2008 a one dimensional numerical model was used to investigate the long term morphodynamics of tide dominated estuaries without river discharge and a bar is formed if the length of the estuary exceeds a threshold value bolla pittaluga et al 2014 employed a one dimensional analytical model to understand the mechanisms of morphodynamic equilibrium of short rivers with fixed banks in which they observed a scour in the channel with an exponentially varying channel width blom et al 2016 2017 explored the equilibrium river profile of channels with fixed banks that accounts for particle abrasion and grain size selection under steady and variable flows respectively while no scours or bars were observed viparelli and eke 2021 further considered unfixed channel width and the predicted channel geometry is comparable with a channel with a relative large bed slope o 1 0 4 with respect to those low lying coastal plains while the longitudinal bed pattern was not explored for those large estuaries the river discharge is usually large gugliotta and saito 2019 and can significantly affect the estuarine morphodynamics guo et al 2014 and even a micro tide can alter the water level gradient and flow velocity during the river flood maselli et al 2020 thus the role of both the river discharge and tides in shaping the estuarine bed profile may not be overlooked while understanding the morphodynamic characteristics of these tidal reaches is still a contemporary challenge especially under sea level rise hoitink and jay 2016 the formation of the estuarine scour bar pattern has not yet been adequately explained and how this pattern would react to changes in sediment supply and sea level is unclear although the pattern has been reproduced by one dimensional morphodynamic models in several studies canestrelli et al 2014 bolla pittaluga et al 2015 guo et al 2016 yuan et al 2020 it is yet unknown how its generation is affected by the fluvial water and sediment fluxes tidal strength and channel geometry that link to the river and tide dominance canestrelli et al 2014 investigated the long term morphodynamics of the bed profile of a tide dominated estuary under a constant river discharge and its sensitivity to the sediment supply they confirmed that under the one dimensional configuration the estuary reaches equilibrium and a decrease in the sediment supply leads to deepening of the channel bolla pittaluga et al 2015 explored the sensitivity of morphodynamic characteristics of tidally dominated estuaries to the channel shape tidal amplitude river discharge and sediment supply their focus was on the tidal length in relatively small estuaries tens of kilometers with large equivalent sediment concentrations 1 kg m 3 estimated as the ratio of total sediment flux to water discharge in guo et al 2016 they focused on the effect of multiple tidal constituents and varying river discharge on large scale estuarine morphodynamics yuan et al 2020 explored the role of sediment supply and sea level rise on the equilibrium transition of a large estuary leuven et al 2021 studied the estuarine longitudinal bed profiles with strong tides and relatively large equivalent sediment concentrations 0 5 kg m 3 they observed only scours as the scour bar pattern did not occur and the observation of scours in river dominated systems like the mississippi lamb et al 2012 was not explained note that for those large low lying estuaries the bed material is generally sand with a grain size larger than 0 063 mm luo et al 2012 canestrelli et al 2014 and the sediment concentration that contributes to the bed evolution generally takes a small portion of the total suspended load which is in the order of 0 1 kg m 3 milliman and farnsworth 2011 for instance sand fraction of the total suspended load is 20 for the yangtze yuan et al 2020 5 15 for the amazon nittrouer et al 2021 and 10 30 for the fly canestrelli et al 2014 the resulting sediment concentration for bed evolution in these large estuaries is generally smaller than those used in the model in bolla pittaluga et al 2015 and leuven et al 2021 herein the longitudinal scour bar pattern in large convergent estuaries on low lying coastal plains is explored more specifically the research question is what are the governing factors channel geometry fluvial water and sediment fluxes and tidal strength for the formation of the scour bar pattern in these systems from river dominated to tide dominated the answer to the question will improve the understanding of the general morphological characteristics of these large estuaries which play an important role in the global water and sediment cycle for their large water and sediment fluxes to answer the question a one dimensional morphodynamic model is employed yuan et al 2020 a funnel shaped channel is used which varies in the width and convergence and a range of values of water and sediment flux and tidal amplitude are considered the use of such a simplified model and settings is inspired by the success of simulating the equilibrium bed profiles of estuaries using similar models canestrelli et al 2014 guo et al 2016 leuven et al 2021 the equilibrium state i e no net changes in the bed level in a tidal period is used to examine the characteristics of the longitudinal bed profiles note that the aim here is trying to reproduce and explain the general trend in the longitudinal bed profile of these large estuaries rather than reproducing exactly the present day observed bed level a thorough calibration of long term modeling against field data is almost impossible for reasons like the large timescale of morphodynamic evolution during which forcing conditions may change todeschini et al 2008 nonetheless efforts are made to examine to what extend the model can capture the variation of longitudinal bed levels in reality by comparing the model results with the observation of several estuaries in addition the effect of changes in the riverine sediment supply and sea level on the scour bar pattern is also discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 model the delft3d model lesser et al 2004 is used to explore the longitudinal bed profiles of large estuaries the model solves the shallow water equations for the water flow and the exner equation for the bed level evolution with a morphodynamic acceleration factor to speed up the morphodynamics roelvink 2006 the engelund hansen formulation engelund and hansen 1967 is used for modeling the total sediment transport simplifications include the use of a funnel shaped channel with fixed river banks rectangular cross sections a constant river discharge a single semi diurnal tidal component and a single grain size canestrelli et al 2014 bolla pittaluga et al 2015 leuven et al 2021 fig 2 shows the sketch of the channel the active width b of the channel is assumed to increase exponentially from river to sea which satisfies 1 b b r b e b r exp l x l c here b r is the river width extending infinitely upstream b e is the mouth width l is the channel length l c is the convergence length and x is the seaward distance from the upstream channel boundary the width at river head x 0 approximately equals b r as l is several times larger than l c for all the considered cases a larger l c means a smoother landward decrease in width i e weaker convergence and vise versa the engelund hansen formulation is a total load formulation which reads 2 q s 0 05 u 5 g c 3 δ 2 d here q s is the volumetric sediment flux per unit width u is the longitudinal velocity g is the gravitational acceleration c is the chézy coefficient δ ρ s ρ 1 1 65 is the immersed relative density with ρ s and ρ being the density of sediment and water respectively and d is the characteristic grain size a constant c of 60 m 1 2 s 1 is used which is similar to studies of long term morphodynamics of large estuaries guo et al 2014 leuven et al 2021 a grain size of 0 1 mm is chosen which is approximately the median grain size of the bed material of large estuaries such as the yangtze and fly luo et al 2012 canestrelli et al 2014 in this study to describe the discharge related total sediment flux an equivalent sediment concentration is defined as the ratio of the total sediment flux to water discharge by analogy with the suspended sediment concentration this concept is useful for comparison between systems with significant differences in their water discharge and total sediment flux an equilibrium sediment concentration is used to describe the equivalent sediment concentration at the equilibrium state at the river head calculated as c s ρ s q s 0 q 0 in which q s 0 b q s is the total sediment flux at the equilibrium state and q 0 is the specified water discharge at the river head 2 2 initial and boundary conditions the initial water level is set to 0 everywhere and the initial bed level changed linearly from a given value at the river head to 10 m at the seaward boundary at the seaward boundary a semi diurnal tide with a period of 12 h is prescribed and the sediment flux is determined by the local flow zero gradient at the river head a constant water discharge q 0 and a zero gradient condition for the sediment flux are used thus the bed level at the river head with respect to the mean sea level z r is nearly fixed given the same river discharge tidal amplitude and channel geometry under the zero gradient sediment transport condition the bed slope is automatically adjusted and in general a lower bed level at the river head i e a smaller z r corresponds to a smaller sediment flux in equilibrium canestrelli et al 2014 yuan et al 2020 for such a setting sensitivity tests using different sediment transport formulations van rijn 1984a b c 1993 result in quite similar bed profiles as the engelund hansen formulation fig s1a in supplement albeit the equilibrium sediment flux differs but remaining in the same order 2 3 design of the numerical experiments table 2 shows the setup of the numerical experiments six parameters are varied to explore the sensitivity of the longitudinal profiles to channel geometry strength of river and tide they are the channel width at the river head b r 0 5 2 km and mouth b e 4 24 km convergence length l c 1 3 times of b e river discharge q 0 6000 40000 m 3 s 1 bed level at river head z r 1 25 m to 10 m and tidal amplitude a 0 0 6 1 8 m each parameter takes 3 values except b e 5 values thus in total 1215 cases are conducted the range of the upstream and downstream widths b r and b e water discharge q 0 bed level at river head with respect to still sea level z r and tidal amplitude a 0 are roughly based on the large estuaries shown in gugliotta and saito 2019 the convergence length is set to 1 to 3 times of the width at the mouth b e this is inspired by the observation of the yangtze amazon fly and 18 other estuaries b e 1000 m shown in gisen and savenije 2015 in which the majority have a convergence length smaller than 3 times of b e see table s1 in supplement note that the cases in which only the bed level at river head z r is varied represent variations in the sediment flux for all these experiments the model domain is set to 600 km which is discretized into 400 grid cells and the time step is set to 4 minutes sensitivity tests show that the morphodynamic acceleration factor has little effect on the model results fig s1b thus a factor of 200 is chosen sensitivity tests for the chézy coefficient and the grain size are also conducted it shows that for a given setup the grain size has minor effects on the equilibrium bed profile fig s1c decreasing the chézy coefficient results in increased bottom friction for the same water depth the effects of which on the bed profile is similar to increasing the tidal amplitude at the mouth fig s1d it has been shown that an equilibrium state of estuaries will be reached using one dimensional morphodynamic models which is characterized by an unchanged tidally averaged bed level that is not sensitive to the initial condition canestrelli et al 2014 leuven et al 2021 the equilibrium state is used to examine the characteristics of the longitudinal bed profiles here a scour is defined as a local minimum of the bed level and a bar as a local maximum the tidal influence on the river boundary is considered to be negligible if the amplitude of the semi diurnal tide is smaller than a quarter of the specified value at the sea boundary in total 98 of the cases in table 2 satisfy this condition table 3 3 results 3 1 occurrence of longitudinal scours and bars scours are observed for almost all the considered cases while bars are more likely to develop for a relatively large convergence length and wide mouth table 3 for instance for the upstream channel width b r of 0 5 km bars are observed for a mouth width b e no less than 6 km and the number of bars increases as b e increases l c also increases as it is set to 1 3 b e for the considered tests 81 tests for each value of b e examples of the longitudinal scour bar pattern are presented in fig 3 where the modeled tidally averaged bed level z b in equilibrium is shown for the experiments in which the channel widths are 2 and 20 km at the river and sea ends respectively left column fig 3a b c shows z b for varying water discharge q 0 and tidal amplitude a 0 with a fixed bed level at river head z r 2 5 m right column fig 3d e f shows z b for varying convergence length l c and z r representing varying sediment flux with a fixed discharge q 0 40 000 m 3 s 1 scours occur for almost all the experiments in fig 3 except a few cases with a convergence length of 60 km in fig 3c red solid and green dashed lines and in fig 3f red dotted line from the left column of fig 3 it is seen that a larger tidal amplitude induces a deeper scour lines of the same type as was observed in leuven et al 2021 while a larger discharge does not necessarily lead to a deeper scour lines of the same color from the right column of fig 3 generally as the convergence length increases weaker convergence the scour shifts seaward and becomes shallower lines of the same color moreover for a smaller z r correspondingly a smaller sediment flux the bed profile is overall lowered lines of the same type bars can occur for both relatively weak and strong tides for relatively weak tides as tidal amplitude a 0 increases the location of the bar slightly shifts landward comparing blue and red dashed lines in figs 3b and c increases in a 0 can lead to the absence of bar and scour and an even further increase in a 0 can result in scour and bar again solid lines in fig 3c the same occurs for decreasing river discharge green lines in fig 3c or sediment flux dotted lines in fig 3f for a fixed relatively large tidal amplitude these findings are explained in term of fluvial and tidal strength in section 4 1 3 2 statistic of longitudinal scours and bars fig 4 shows the occurrence of the scour and scour bar patterns in the parameter space including the convergence length l c equilibrium sediment concentration c s bed slope at river head s r distance of the scour l s c o u r and bar l b a r to the mouth fig 4a shows that the scour bar pattern occurs for relatively large convergence length and the resulting equilibrium sediment concentration generally ranges in 0 01 0 3 kg m 3 the modeled bed slope s r is generally in the range of 0 5 1 0 5 to 4 1 0 5 fig 4b a close relationship between l s c o u r and l c is observed fig 4c i e generally the distance of the scour to the mouth is within 2 5 7 times of the convergence length 0 400 km the location of the bar ranges between 0 to 200 km from the mouth fig 4d for those large estuaries on low lying coastal plains the observed bed slope is usually small i e in the order of 10 5 the sediment concentration that contribute to the bed evolution in those estuaries is in the order of 0 1 kg m 3 canestrelli et al 2014 leuven et al 2021 the location of the observed scours is 100 300 km from the mouth and the bars are within 100 km from the mouth fig 1 these values fall in the range of those from the above numerical experiments generally 0 400 km from the mouth for scours and 0 200 km for bars figs 4c d 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism for the formation of longitudinal scour bar pattern longitudinal scours and bars are observed for both relatively weak and strong tides in the absence of tides the analytical equilibrium state using the engelund hansen formulation is derived in appendix a the scour and bar patterns can be examined by the bed slope in equilibrium the bed slope s is written as 3 s d z b d x d ζ d x d d d x s f r i s d with 4 s f r i u 2 d c 2 s d d d d x here ζ is the surface level and d is the water depth s f r i and s d are the bed slope terms related to friction and water depth respectively for the considered experiments the average velocity is in the order of 1 m s 1 and the average water depth is around 10 m which gives a froude number in the order of 0 1 thus the advection term contributed to the gradient of ζ is neglected as it is much smaller than the terms on the right hand side of eq 3 see fig s2 for example for a funnel shaped channel eq 1 it is derived from the analytical solution in appendix a and eq 4 that 5 s f r i c 2 q 0 2 5 k d c s ρ s 3 5 b 2 5 s d 4 5 q 0 4 5 k d c s ρ s 1 5 b 9 5 b b r l c 1 here c s is the equilibrium sediment concentration and k 20 g c 3 δ 2 is a coefficient the term s f r i is always negative and its magnitude increases monotonically seaward while s d is always positive and its magnitude increases from 0 at river head to its maximum at b 2 25 b r and next decreases seaward appendix a thus the bed slope near the river head is mainly related to s f r i and is negative seaward decrease at a scour or a bar the bed slope is 0 and thus the necessary condition for the presence of the scour bar pattern is that s 0 or s d s f r i 1 has no less than two solutions the term s d s f r i increases from 0 at river head to its maximum value at b 11 b r 6 appendix a and the above necessary condition gives 6 s d s f r i b 11 b r 6 4 5 c 2 q 0 6 5 k d c s ρ s 4 5 5 b r 6 11 b r 6 11 5 1 l c 1 7 s d s f r i b e 4 5 c 2 q 0 6 5 k d c s ρ s 4 5 b e b r b e 11 5 1 l c 1 it means that as the channel width b increases from b r to 11 b r 6 seawards the bed slope s at the equilibrium state increases from negative to positive s d s f r i thus a scour occurs in between as b continues increasing seawards s decreases and becomes negative at the river mouth s d s f r i thus a bar occurs between 11 b r 6 and b e these equations reveal that the presence of scours and bars is closely related to water discharge sediment flux and the geometry for conditions with no or weak tides eq 6 can be used to predict the presence of scour and with eq 7 the occurrence of bar can be predicted for a bar to develop the upper and lower limits of the convergence length l c can be estimated by eq 6 and eq 7 respectively for a given channel with fixed width at river head and river discharge the upper limit of l c is fixed and a wider mouth gives a wider range of l c for the occurrence of bar larger b e in eq 7 this is confirmed by analytical solutions fig s3 in supplement to illustrate the occurrence of scours and bars fig 5 shows tidally averaged bed level z b water depth d and the corresponding bed slope terms from numerical experiments as in fig 3c in the absence of tides blue lines in fig 5 almost overlapped by red lines as the channel diverges seaward the water depth d decreases figs 5b g l the magnitude of s f r i inversely proportional to d see eq 4 increases figs 5e j o and s d first increases figs 5d i n leading to s 0 that corresponds to the scour figs 5c h m as the channel width continues increasing s d decreases which could result in s 0 that corresponds to the bar figs 5c h m the presence of tides modifies the appearance of the above river dominated scours and bars for a relatively weak tide a 0 0 6 m red lines in fig 5 the water depth is quite similar to the cases with a 0 0 except near the estuary mouth where d is increased comparing red with blue lines in figs 5b g l correspondingly near the mouth s d becomes smaller and even negative seaward increase in d and s f r i becomes smaller as the tidal strength increases the tidal influence extends more upstream accompanied by increases in d both s f r i and s d decrease with more significant changes in the latter e g figs 5n o resulting in the landward shift of the bar e g fig 5k as the tidal strength continues increasing a balance between river and tide can be achieved for which the scour and bar disappear green line in fig 5a and orange line in fig 5f the downstream depth becomes similar to that in the upstream river dominated reach green line in fig 5b and orange line in fig 5g correspondingly s d decreases such that no intersection between s d and s f r i occurs green line in fig 5c and orange line in fig 5h thus the bed slope becomes always negative along the channel leading to the absence of scour bar pattern a further increase in the tidal strength can lead to the formation of scour again the so called tide dominated scour and possibly a bar close to the mouth as well orange line in fig 5a the depth generally first increases and next decreases may increase again i e negative s d in the seaward direction orange line in fig 5b correspondingly s d has a complex decrease increase decrease pattern negative to positive and may to negative again e g orange lines in figs 5d i moreover downstream of the river dominated reach s f r i decreases as the water depth increases resulting in the seaward shift of the scour fig 5a 4 2 fluvial scours versus tidal scours the above analysis illustrates that scours can be classified as river and tide dominated i e fluvial and tidal scours e g fig 5a depending on the relative strength of river and tide that relates to water and sediment discharge tidal amplitude and geometry a clear distinction between fluvial and tidal scours is that for fluvial scours the bed slope upstream of the scour s s is no larger than that in the upstream river dominated reach s r while for tidal scours s s is larger than s r fig 5c thus the bed slope can be used as an indicator for the river or tide dominance another difference is that for fluvial scours the near scour water depth is smaller than that in the upstream river dominated reach while the opposite is true for tidal scours fig 5b and fig s4 in supplement in bolla pittaluga et al 2015 the scour bar pattern with fluvial scours is observed in a relatively small estuary with and without the presence of tides fig 13 therein the channel is 50 km long with a convergence length of 2 2 km the width increases from 182 m at the river head to 2093 m at the river mouth and the river discharge is 1000 m3 s 1 with an equivalent sediment concentration of 0 94 kg m 3 the pattern disappears for convergence lengths of 4 3 and 6 5 km or a rectangular channel for the same settings as the above case eqs 6 and 7 show that the scour bar pattern occurs for a convergence length approximately in the range of 1 4 km in their case as the sediment flux is large the bed slope is also relatively large 10 4 this observation is consistent with the finding reported in the present study showing that the scour bar pattern can develop with and without tides moreover it implies that this pattern can occur in small estuaries as well and eqs 6 and 7 can be used to predict its occurrence examples of fluvial scours may include that in the lowermost mississippi lamb et al 2012 from its bed slope and seaward divergent channel near the mouth tidal scours observed here are similar to those in leuven et al 2021 in terms of slope and depth their focus was on scours that occur with a relatively strong tide and large equivalent sediment concentration 0 45 kg m 3 for the above setting in bolla pittaluga et al 2015 resulting in a large bed slope 10 4 in that study a dimensionless parameter ψ max q t i d e q r i v e r b e b r l c was employed to identify the occurrence of scour with q t i d e and q r i v e r being the tidal and river discharge per unit width at the mouth and river head respectively in their experiments generally the location of scours corresponds to the peak q t i d e q r i v e r and scours develop for ψ 0 3 it means that a strong tide and small convergence length strong convergence would favor the formation of tidal scours here the location of tidal scours is at the peak q t i d e q r i v e r or slightly upstream while tidal scours can occur for ψ 0 3 as well fig s5 in supplement thus ψ 0 3 could be sufficient but not necessary for the presence of tidal scours in the cases with no scours or bars here generally ψ falls in the range of 0 2 0 3 examples of tidal scours may include the besar distributary of the kapuas river in indonesia kästner et al 2017 from its larger bed slope and water depth at the scour than the upstream reach the scour in the amazon estuary was viewed to be tidal leuven et al 2021 using an idealized channel eq 1 with simplified parameters based on the amazon can result in the scour bar pattern fig 6 and the scour seems to be fluvial from the observed bed slope the studies which account for the river discharge bolla pittaluga et al 2014 blom et al 2016 2017 give similar formulations for the friction related bed slope s f r i as in eq 5 however they may not explain the longitudinal variation of the bed slope in the presence of tides which is important especially for cases where tides are dominant leuven et al 2021 for studies that consider both tides and river discharge bolla pittaluga et al 2015 leuven et al 2021 the estimation of the sediment concentration that contributes to the bed evolution for the small estuary 0 45 0 94 kg m 3 may be too large for those large estuaries the present model employs a zero gradient sediment flux at the river head the same as guo et al 2016 which does not require the sediment flux to be specified explicitly this is the main reason why the model results are insensitive to the sediment transport formulation and the grain size as the sediment flux is automatically adjusted according to the hydrodynamic condition at the river head this could be quite useful for estuaries with little information of sediment given the upstream bed level river discharge tidal amplitude and channel geometry the model can be used to estimate the equilibrium sediment flux and predict the equilibrium estuarine bed profile 4 3 comparison with field data experiments are conducted to further quantify the similarity between the model results and the observation of several estuaries field data of three estuaries including the yangtze yuan et al 2020 mississippi lamb et al 2012 and besar kästner et al 2017 are collected table 4 shows the model setup of river discharge tide and grain size for these estuaries and fig 7 shows the modeled equilibrium bed profiles in general the model results reproduce the longitudinal variation of the bed level reasonably well given such simplified configurations the correlation coefficient c c and the relative mean absolute error r m a e see formulations in supplement are used to evaluate the model performance from table 4 it is seen that for the settings the correlation coefficient for the yangtze is above 0 60 and reaches 0 90 for the mississippi and besar use of medium and high river discharge for the yangtze and mississippi gives good 0 2 r m a e 0 4 and excellent r m a e 0 2 model performance respectively and overall the model performance is reasonable 0 4 r m a e 0 7 for the besar for the besar the used discharge is based on the value of the upstream station herawati et al 2018 while several tributaries are present along the main channel of the besar thus the discharge used here might be larger than reality and a smaller discharge e g 1000 m 3 s 1 with the present setting for the besar can give a better model performance 4 4 implications large estuaries on low lying coastal plains and their surroundings can supply habitats for millions of people and important waterway for transportation and shipping they are facing both human intervention and climate change including decreases in the sediment supply due to dam operation and sea level rise knowing how the longitudinal bed profile of estuaries will react to those changes would be beneficial for management and planning of these systems bolla pittaluga et al 2014 arkesteijn et al 2021 sediment reduction leads to overall erosion of the estuary and sea level rise gives rise to local increase in the water depth near the mouth yuan et al 2020 in both cases the tidal effect is strengthened which has been illustrated with the tidal residual sediment flux and the landward shift of the fluvial marine transition zone decreases in the sediment supply smaller z r lead to an overall lowering of the bed level comparing lines of the same type in figs 3d e f and fig 6 and transition of scour from fluvial to tidal could occur e g dotted lines in fig 3f sea level rise can also induce changes in the scour type as the tidal influence extends more upstream see the example in fig 8 the opposite could occur for increases in sediment supply and sea level fall lambeck et al 2002 the characteristics of these scours would be helpful in explaining the historical dominance of river and tide from the longitudinal stratigraphy 5 conclusions longitudinal scour and bar patterns are observed in large convergent estuaries on low lying coastal plains a one dimensional morphodynamic model is used to explain these characteristics fluvial water discharge sediment flux tide and channel geometry are shown to be important in developing and shaping scours and bars for those low lying systems bars favor channels with relatively weak convergence and wide mouth while scours normally occur scours are classified as fluvial and tidal which can be detected from the longitudinal patterns of bed slope and water depth fluvial scours are characterized by a similar bed slope upstream of the scour and a smaller water depth with respect to those at the river head while tidal scours are characterized by larger bed slope and water depth with respect to those at the river head a balance between river and tide can lead to no scours or bars with global sediment reduction and sea level rise a shallow fluvial scour could transit to a deep tidal scour as the tidal influence extends more upstream credit authorship

volumetric sediment flux m 3 s 1 for a constant water discharge q 0 and a constant sediment discharge q s 0 with no tides the analytical solution for the equilibrium is derived here in the equilibrium

decreases towards the river mouth if b e 2 25 b r a scour and a bar correspond to a local minimum and a local maximum of the bed level respectively which means that the bed slope there is zero thus the presence of the scour bar pattern requires that s 0 or s d s f r i 1 has no less than two solutions from eq 5 the term s d s f r i reads s d s f r i 4 5 c 2 q 0 6 5 k d c s ρ s 4 5 b 11 5 b b r l

towards the river mouth if b e 11 b r 6 thus to have both a scour and a bar the maximum of s d s f r i should be larger than 1 and the value of s d s f r i at the river mouth should be less than 1

2671,acid in situ leaching isl can be used as a mining technique for in situ uranium recover from underground acids and oxidants as lixiviants were continuously injected into a sandstone type uranium deposit in bayan uul china it was conducted to facilitate the dissolution of uranium minerals to generate uranyl ions which could then be extracted for the recovery of uranium resources by the pumping cycle a reactive transport model based on phast was developed to investigate the dynamic reactive migration process of uranium the simulated results well reproduce the fluid dynamic evolution in the injecting and pumping units as well as the dynamic release of uranium the simulated leaching area indicates that the uranium ore leaching area was much larger than the acidification area in addition the pollution plume of uranium and acid water was larger than that of the leaching area which can be used as a reference for uranium mining schemes furthermore the parameter sensitivity analysis indicates the volume fraction of uranium ore and the reaction rate were the main factors affecting uranium leaching efficiency without considering the blockage of pores by precipitation the fe2 in the reinjection fluid had a significant negative influence on uranium leaching keywords banyan uul uranium deposit acid in situ leaching reactive transport influence area sensitivity analysis

is regarded to be an important strategic nuclear power resource monnet et al 2017 boghi et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 zeng et al 2021 it is widely distributed in the earth s crust while the estimates of its abundance lie between 2 and 4 ppm fleischer 1995 clark et al 2006 in recent times modern uranium production has usually relied on sandstone hosted deposits adams 1991 lovley and phillips 1992 currently owing to conventional mining environmental issues such as tailings large surface disturbances and water pollution kidd 2009 iaea 2016 2001 it s difficult to implement conventional mining methods i e open pit and underground mining to meet the standards of mining sandstone type uranium deposits as a result the conventional methods are gradually being replaced by the in situ leaching isl technique now isl has become the preferred mining technology for uranium deposits of the sandstone type saunders et al 2016 lagneau et al 2019 to date 57 4 of the world s uranium deposit is mined by isl nea and iaea 2020 however the origins of the hydrogeochemical processes occurring during uranium leaching and uranium migration in deep underground ore layers are poorly understood therefore it is challenging to optimize the isl process and predict the leaching range zhou et al 2019a developing effective technical means for studying isl operations is imperative the principle of isl is as follows a leaching solution is initially injected into an ore bearing aquifer through injection wells relying on the circulation of fluids for controlling the seepage in hydrogeochemical fields of the ore bed a chemical environment conducive to the dissolution and migration of uranium is created then the uranium enriched leachate is extracted through several production wells to achieve in situ recovery wellmer and becker platen 2002 bhargava et al 2015 iaea 2018a b isl is subdivided into the acid method and the alkali method according to the nature of the injected leaching solution at present acid isl is more widely used in certain countries including uzbekistan kazakhstan australia and china due to its relatively low mining requirements no need for a mining fleet milling capacity and heavy preparatory work such as removing the overburden for open pit mines and developing access shafts for underground mining low reagent costs and high leaching rate mudd 2001a b the lixiviant usually includes sulphuric acid and other acids such as hydrochloric and nitric acids which are more expensive and would pose more environmental challenges edwards and oliver 2000 iaea 2005 hydrogeological scientific issues affecting isl can be abstracted through the coupling of solute transport and geochemical reactions xu et al 2012 liu et al 2014 yuan et al 2017 langanay et al 2021 this issue concering the uranium mining process can be explored using the reactive transport model rtm panfilov et al 2016 johnson and tutu 2016 dangelmayr et al 2017 tungatarova et al 2020 shayakhmetov et al 2020 isl is considered a highly efficient mining technology iaea 2001 heili 2018 however some radionuclides and heavy metals are released by the reaction between the injected leaching solution and ore which could directly enter groundwater under the action of hydrodynamic and geochemical processes leading to groundwater pollution mudd 2001a b therefore it is essential to predict the influence of isl mining on groundwater quality in a given mining area johnson et al 2010 developed an rtm to simulate the changes in water quality and the contaminant plume migration after uranium mining near edgemont south dakota however the pollution induced by mining operation has gradually become a factor used to rationally optimize the isl mining process and predict the temporal spatial evolution of leaching uranium johnson and tutu 2013 established a one dimensional rtm to determine the evolution and migration of uranium in the leacheate based on two different geochemical databases and various geochemical parameters nevertheless the developed model only indicated that the spatial temporal evolution of uranium leaching was random under the manifestation of various geochemical conditions ben simon et al 2014 used geochemical reaction simulation batch experiments to calibrate the reaction kinetics law and applied this to the simulation of an rtm and successfully simulated the hydrogeochemical transport process of the in situ recovery isr process on the laboratory scale the simulation results help to elucidate the uranium dissolution precipitation mechanisms during the migration process lagneau et al 2019 built a block scale rtm for the katco mine in southern kazakhstan to identify the main transport process of industrially produced uranium and successfully translated this from a laboratory simulation to a field simulation however the prediction of the uranium leaching area and pollution plume are rarely discussed simultaneously dong et al 2016 therefore it is imperative to quantitatively determine the leaching and pollution range through numerical simulation to gain a better understanding of uranium mining planning and groundwater pollution delineation from this perspective it is necessary to build a geological model before establishing an rtm model owing to the complex geological structure of uranium deposits langanay et al 2021 used a stochastic geostatistical model coupled with rtm and obtained a good approximation of uranium production variability when studying the geological structure model of uranium deposits however the intrinsic parameters of the numerical model were complex and uncertain which resulted in a large calculation burden and the inability to make timely and effective predictions thus simplifying the secondary factors to optimise the model without affecting the simulation results remains indispensable the sensitivity analysis can effectively distinguish the degree of influence of different parameters on modelling results more specifically through a sensitivity analysis of the co2 o2 leaching process of four isl units in the qianjiadian sandstone type uranium deposit mining area qiu et al 2021 found that the uranium content controlled uranium release and migration and the oxygen concentration controlled uranium oxidation and dissolution these findings facilitated the optimisation of large scale mining area simulations similarly it is imperative to simplify the secondary factors through sensitivity analysis to optimize the complex uranium leaching model by the acid method this will provide guidance for subsequent large scale mining area simulations as a long term mining area the mining technology in the bayan uul sandstone type uranium deposit in inner mongolia is relatively mature however a basis for the qualitative analysis of uranium dynamic leaching and the delineation of the mining scope is lacking to achieve these goals an isl field trial was conducted using h2so4 and h2o2 as the leaching agents an rtm based on the phast multi component transport model package was developed to simulate the field trial therefore the objectives of this work are to 1 investigate the dynamic release process of an acid isl process based on the reactive transport modelling 2 identify the influential scope posed by isl and 3 characterize the key factors influencing uranium leaching 2 field test description 2 1 hydrogeology the field test was conducted in the western region of the manite depression in the erlian basin inner mongolia which is an interlayer oxidation zone type uranium deposit fig 1 currently one of the sandstone type uranium deposits is suitable for isl in the erlian basin guo 2014 it is primarily controlled by sand bodies of the paleo valley in the upper part of the saihan formation the formation of the paleo valley was controlled by negative landforms caused by the basement structure the basement strata include the lower cambrian upper carboniferous and lower permian the mesozoic cenozoic sedimentary caprocks with age from the jurassic to the quaternary were developed uranium ore bodies were formed in the paleo valley sand bodies in the upper part of the saihan formation during the lower cretaceous these were developed in the valley sand body under the control of the phreatic interlayer oxidation zones there are three types of groundwater occur in the area bedrock fissure water clastic rock pore water and loose rock pore water clastic rock pore water is the most critical groundwater type in the area and its abundance is controlled by the sedimentary environment the pore water in the clastic rocks of the saihan formation is controlled by the northeast trending paleo valley and is distributed in the middle of the stepwise alpine plain thus the aquifer spreads along a northeast trending belt the lithology of the aquifer consists of a mixed layer of sandstone and sandy conglomerate with a thickness of about 30 80 m there are two to four layers of mudstone and local argillaceous siltstone interlayers groundwater is rich in the confined aquifers with a buried depth of 10 45 m and a high permeability coefficient of 8 9 13 2 m d 1 the average concentrations of na k ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 and cl in groundwater were 512 67 mg l 1 63 20 mg l 1 54 96 mg l 1 511 79 mg l 1 423 36 mg l 1 and 433 10 mg l 1 respectively chen 2017 the groundwater had a salinity of 1 99 g l 1 and the initial ph and eh were 7 03 and 279 83 mv respectively insights from drilling data revealed that the ore bodies were all sandstone with burial depths ranging from 100 to 120 m the thickness of single layer ore bodies ranges from 2 35 to 13 85 m and the cumulative thickness ranges from 5 5 to 15 25 m the average thickness of the effective ore bearing aquifers is 8 67 m units i and ii are a set of six spot pattern isl uranium field trial sites the average uranium content of each borehole in acid isl zheng 2017 are as follows 0 013 cdi 1 0 0139 cdi 2 0 0144 zdi 1 0 0138 zdi 2 0 0125 zdi 3 0 0191 zdi 4 0 018 zdi 5 0 0168 zdi 6 0 0137 zdi 7 and 0 0108 zdi 1 this indicates that the uranium ore content and cumulative thickness of unit ii are higher than those for unit i because the ore bed of unit i is close to the oxidation zone with a high content of oxidiants substances iron oxides such as hematite and a low content of pyrite the ore bed of unit ii is close to the reduction zone with a high content of reducing substances and a low content of iron oxides fig 2 2 2 isl uranium field trial the isl field trial equipment consisted of an isl well pad hydrometallurgy workshop liquor pool and sulphuric acid tower fig 3 the isl well pad six spot pattern consists of two groups of five injection wells and one production well the distance between the injection wells and the production wells is 30 m and the distance between adjacent injection wells is 35 27 m the test procedure can be described as follows firstly the leaching solution with the required acidity for in situ leaching was prepared in the liquor pool secondly the leaching solution was injected into the ore bearing aquifer via the eight injection wells thirdly the leachate was extracted via the two production wells finally the leachate was transported to the hydrometallurgy workshop for further extraction and processed into uranium products eventually the field trial had run for 650 days the concentration of the leaching agent was continuously adjusted according to the leaching effect of uranium in different periods table 1 at the initial stage 10 g l 1 of sulphuric acid was used to acidify the hydrochemical groundwater environment in the ore bearing aquifer and the acidification lasted 66 d at the middle stage to accelerate the leaching rate of uranium hydrogen peroxide with concentrations of 0 75 and 1 0 g l 1 was added to the leaching solution at the time of 67 91 and 92 131 days respectively the oxidation time was 65 d at the final stage when the acid consuming substances had been greatly reduced the sulphuric acid concentration was decreased to reduce the acid consumption 2 3 field trial results analysis 1 ph and eh the dissolution and precipitation of minerals are controlled by acid and oxidant concentrations respectively the redox of leachate is also controlled by ph and eh ben simon et al 2014 based on this principle the isl process is divided into four successive stages fig 4 a stage 1 is the acidification stage where the high acidity leaching solution replaces the groundwater in the ore bearing strata creating a hydrochemical environment that is conducive to the dissolution of uranium minerals stage 2 is the oxidation stage where the oxidant content in the leaching solution is increased to accelerate the oxidation and dissolution of uranium minerals stage 3 is the rapid dissolution stage when the acidity drops to close to the input value and the eh value increases to the above oxidation reduction potential where the dissolution of uranium minerals is rapidly facilitated stage 4 is the gradual dissolution stage in which the relatively insoluble uranium bearing minerals in the ore bed continue to slowly dissolve 2 uranium leaching the variation uranium concentration in the leachate is shown in fig 4b during the first 15 days of the test acid consuming minerals in the ore bearing aquifer reacted with acid resulting in less uranium leaching 0 5 mg l 1 uranium was leached efficiently after 15 days after adding the oxidant at 67 days stage 1 the leachate uranium concentration increased again peaking at 127 days stage 2 the uranium concentration of well cdi 1 was 26 58 mg l 1 and that of well cdi 2 was 99 74 mg l 1 the concentration of uranium in the leachate decreased continuously after oxidant addition ceased at 132 days indicating that the oxidant could promote uranium leaching further the concentration of sulphuric acid was reduced by 4 5 g l 1 at 169 days which then adjusted itself back to 10 g l 1 at 176 days the concentration of uranium continued to decrease and reached a minimum at 197 days which indicated that it was lagging behind the acidity of the leaching solution however the uranium concentration increased at 197 days again reaching a maximum at 283 days the uranium concentration of well cdi 1 was 27 83 mg l 1 and that of well cdi 2 was 60 mg l 1 after 283 days the uranium concentration of the leachate continued to decrease slowly until the end of the test the variation characteristics of uranium concentration in the cdi 1 and cdi 2 leachate over time were similar but the concentration values were different the uranium concentration in well cdi 2 was higher than that in well cdi 1 which may have been caused by the uneven distribution of uranium deposits the average thicknesses of unit i and unit ii were 7 85 and 12 39 m respectively leading to the difference in uranium content per square meter in the isl unit thus to further explain the influence from the uranium heterogeneity it was necessary to consider these findings in conjunction with those of the model 3 ferric ions the trend of ferric ion fe3 concentration in the leachate as a function of time is shown in fig 4c the concentration of fe3 in the leachate was low in the first 67 days this may be caused by the precipitation of fe oh 3 or the adsorption of fe3 by soil at the initial stage of acidification zhao and li 2021 the concentration of fe3 in well cdi 1 increased quickly at 129 days and that in well cdi 2 increased quickly at 285 days indicating that the dissolved amount of iron bearing minerals were different at various locations more specifically well cdi 1 was close to the oxidation zone and well cdi 2 was close to the reduction zone which resulted in the uneven distribution of iron minerals and a higher concentration of fe3 in the leachate from well cdi 1 than that from cdi 2 therefore to further explain the influence of iron mineral heterogeneity on isl these results need to be considered in the model 4 al3 and ca2 the variations in leachate ca2 and al3 concentrations with time fig 4d and e respectively were as follows during the initial 67 days stage 1 the concentration of ca2 and al3 increased rapidly indicating that the aluminium containing minerals and calcium containing minerals dissolved rapidly at the acidification stage subsequently the concentration of ca2 and al3 increased slowly indicating that the dissolution of aluminium and calcium containing minerals still happens in the leaching process but at a slower rate than that at stage 1 3 kinetic reactive transport modelling 3 1 governing equations the reactive transport model is a system of differential equations describing the flow the thermodynamic equilibria and the reaction kinetics in the mathematical model the equation for the advection dispersion reaction adr migration process of in situ uranium leaching xue and xie 2007 appelo and rolle 2010 can be described as 1 c n t x i d ii c n x i x i v i c n w θ c n s j 1 m r ξ where cn mol l 1 is the total concentration of the nth liquid phase component dii stands for the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor m2 d 1 when the main direction of the dispersion tensor is consistent with the direction of the groundwater velocity vi m d 1 is the average velocity of the pore water along the coordinate axis of xi which can be obtained by solving the groundwater movement model w d 1 represents the flow rate of the source sink term per unit

concentration of groundwater component ξ in a chemical reaction kinetic rate laws were used to describe the heterogeneous processes before it reaches a thermodynamic equilibrium prikryl et al 2017 noiriel et al 2004 2009 these include the dissolution rate of different minerals and the precipitation rate of the newly formed minerals the simulation code phreeqc uses rate laws of the general form 2 r d m dt k a w i β i α i 1 ω n θ η where m is the mole number of the mineral mol l 1 k is the variation in the rate constant with temperature mol m 2 s 1 aw m2 l 1 represents the mineral surface

solution when the mineral is supersaturated ωn 1 and the mineral precipitates on the other hand when it is unsaturated ωn 1 and the mineral dissolves the exponents θ and η are the order of the rate law and define its nonlinearity they are generally obtained experimentally and are usually equal to 1 ben simon et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 in this work phast software was selected to simulate the uranium leaching which couples the flow and transport code hst3d kipp 1987 1997 as well as the geochemical model phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 parkhurst et al 2010 the model first calculates the flow velocity and based on the groundwater flow field the geochemical reactions and chemical transport are simulated 3 2 modelling strategy two factors must be considered for numerical simulations of uranium leaching by acid isl one is the geological conditions of the uranium deposit mineral distribution and the other is the test phenomena including the geochemical reactions occurring during the experimental process the kinetics of these reactions and the hydrodynamic transport in relation to the reaction kinetics thus the numerical model is coupled with the assignment of mineral content in the grid divisions and the reactive transport equation of groundwater the main difficulty in using this method lies in the random distribution of the mineral content in the deposit and the influence of different mineral reactions on dissolved ions therefore it is necessary to appropriately simplify the model based on the known conditions and to analyse each parameter s impact on the simulation results analyzing the dynamic release process of an acid isl process consists of two essential steps firstly a rtm was developed to simulate the isl field trial and then the influential area of isl was identified secondly sensitivity analysis was used to identify the main factor affecting uranium leaching fig 5 the isl model couples several modules which are described below 1 generalisation of mineral distribution the distribution and content of uranium deposits in the study area differ significantly when establishing the geochemical model the uranium content analysis results of the ore samples at the actual borehole were taken as the known points then the uranium content in the entire simulation area was assigned by regular circular interpolation and linear extrapolation to achieve a heterogeneous generalisation of the uranium deposits fig 6 a in the sample analysis the valence distribution ratio of the measured uranium was 0 71 0 29 hexavalent tetravalent zheng 2017 as schoepite is generally considered to be the most common oxidation product of uranium deditius et al 2007 it was assumed that the tetravalent uranium ore was uraninite and the hexavalent uranium ore was schoepite ben simon et al 2014 in addition to the uranium ore other primary minerals including calcite pyrite hematite albite k feldspar kaolinite and quartz also have a significant impact on the dissolution of uranium ore and should be considered in the model the average content of other minerals was known table 2 but the analysis content at the borehole was unknown it was impossible to know exactly the distribution of additional minerals the changes of ca2 and al3 concentrations in the lixivium at the two production wells were similar ca2 mainly came from calcite and al3 mainly came from albite k feldspar and kaolinite indicating a small distribution difference in these minerals therefore the distribution of calcite albite k feldspar and kaolinite in the ore bearing layer could be generalised as a homogeneous medium the oxidising iron minerals were mostly distributed in well cdi 1 and reducing iron minerals were mostly distributed in well cdi 2 based on the accompanying relationship between the uranium ore and iron the average content of iron was distributed according to the proportion of uranium ore content this enabled the content of iron at each borehole to be assigned and the entire simulation area to be interpolated fig 6a and b 2 hydrodynamic model in the isl test simulation a simplified system was developed to represent the model area of the ore bearing aquifer based on the hydrogeological conditions of the mining process the simulated zone was a cuboid with length of 500 m width of 500 m and height of 8 67 m which was divided into 100 100 grids with a side length of 5 m the boundary of the model was set as a specified head boundary with the same head of 21 m the lateral recharge of adjacent ore bearing layers was assumed to be negligible fig 7 a the flow was uniform and constant throughout the simulation as the actual flow of the injection and production wells of the two isl units fluctuated overtime during the simulation the average value was taken at different time stages for simplification fig 7b the model stress period was set to 650 d and an automatic time step was adopted for time discretisation the transport parameters table 3 used in the hydrodynamic model were the effective porosity peff hydraulic conductivity k dispersivity d and specific storage ss 3 minerals and kinetics the mineral species chemical formulae and solubility constants were extracted from the phreeqc database llnl dat table 4 the kinetic rate is an intrinsic parameter of a mineral framework and its changes are mainly caused by the formation of crystallinity structural defects in addition to changes in the specific surface area ben simon et al 2014 lagneau et al 2019 for in situ experimental modelling the kinetic rate constant under acidic conditions obtained from existing literature was selected as a reference table 4 the extracted simulated results were fitted to the experimental data by adjusting the specific surface area as rather than the kinetic rate constant k many primary minerals were initially present in the ore the main minerals selected for the simplified model were uraninite schoepite calcite pyrite hematite albite k feldspar and kaolinite the precipitation and dissolution of these minerals were assumed to be kinetically controlled schoepite is considered a common oxidation product of uranium deditius et al 2007 janeczek and ewing 1991 since no information related to the kinetics for schoepite dissolution in acidic solutions was found in the literature the kinetics of uraninite were used instead clay minerals are likely to control the silica concentration in leachates and may dissolve or precipitate during acid leaching clay minerals are mainly composed of illite interstratified illite montmorillonite and kaolinite to simplify the model only kaolinite was considered and a high specific surface area 150 m2 mol 1 was applied until the value was equivalent to that of illite and illite montmorillonite the precipitation and dissolution of quartz were assumed to occur under thermodynamic equilibrium due to its relatively slow reaction rates under acidic conditions 4 hydrochemistry the hydrochemistry of the geochemical model comprisesd the initial components in groundwater and the injected leaching solution the main components included na k ca2 mg2 h cl hco3 so4 2 and o2 aq the associated aqueous phase complexes were defined in the thermodynamic database based on the mass conservation and charge conservation principles the concentrations of na and k were taken as 0 23 and 0 28 g l 1 respectively changes of the leaching solution component concentration over time are given in table 1 because the concentration of sulphuric acid decreased when it was mixed with groundwater the ph value was finely adjusted during the simulation in the absence of an oxidant the oxygen concentration of the leaching solution refers to as the saturated dissolved oxygen in water at 25 c 8 25 mg l 1 the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide also results in the release of oxygen since the dissolved oxygen content would be too high if it was directly assigned to the hydrogen peroxide concentration in the simulation this content needed to be appropriately lowered to fit the field trial results in the calibration model 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration model the simulated and measured values of five hydrochemical parameters ph u6 ca2 al3 and fe3 in the trial are presented in fig 8 a comparison of the simulated and measured results indicates that changes in major ions were reasonably captured by the rtm uranium leaching was affected by impurity minerals the concentration of the leaching agent and uranium content therefore the model was modified using the following steps fig 8a 1 calcite dissolved quickly and consumed acid delating groundwater acidification and resulting in a gradual increase in the leachate uranium concentration at the acidification stage 1 0 66 d the calcite content in the simulation was taken as an average for the entire study area which was lower than the actual content and the simulated value of uranium leaching at the initial stage was higher due to lower acid consumption during oxidation stage 2 67 131 d upon the addition of h2o2 solution the eh value of the leaching solution increased resulting in a sharp increase in leaching uranium when the addition of h2o2 ceased at the stage 3 132 175 d the oxidation of the leaching solution decreased and the eh value decreased accordingly the reduction in the reaction rate of the uranium ore led to a sharp decrease in the leachate uranium concentration in this process due to the effect of impurity minerals and oxidants the reaction surface area of uranium minerals could be adjusted to correct the model 2 with changes in the concentration of injected sulphuric acid the concentration of leached uranium first increased and then decreased at the stage 3 176 290 d and 290 330 d indicating that the change in sulphuric acid concentration affected the dynamic release of uranium given that the sulphuric acid injected in the production process mixes with the solution after uranium extraction it is necessary to adjust the sulphuric acid concentration when fitting the results at the stage 4 330 650 d the concentration of sulphuric acid remained unchanged and the concentration of leached uranium gradually decreased this indicated that the content of uranium minerals decreased with the dissolution of uranium minerals during this process the specific surface area of uranium minerals was kept constant and the concentration of sulphuric acid was adjusted by adjusting the parameters of the two processes the simulation results of uranium leaching are in good agreement with the experimental results carbonate calcite is the major acid base buffer in the isl process ma et al 2014 and directly affects the ph value the release of ca2 in the leachate mainly come from the dissolution of carbonate lagneau et al 2019 at the acidification stage the rapid dissolution of calcite delayed the acidification of groundwater which lead to a rapid increase of ca2 content in the leachate and a slow decrease of the ph this indicates that the release of ca2 and the change in ph of the solution can be dynamically controlled by adjusting the reaction surface area of calcite fig 8b with decreases in the calcite content the acid consumption gradually weakens and the ca2 and ph gradually stabilize the simulated results are consistent with the measurement results which shows that it is reasonable to adjust the specific surface area of calcite k feldspar albite and kaolinite will react with sulphuric acid to form al3 which is the main aluminium bearing mineral with the continuous injection of sulphuric acid the mineral content decreases and the concentration of al3 in the leachate increases fig 8c this shows that the dynamic release of al3 can be controlled by adjusting the specific surface area of feldspar and kaolinite iron minerals pyrite and hematite are key redox buffers in acid isl mining eglizaud et al 2006 the dynamic release of iron ions was controlled by adjusting the specific surface area of pyrite and hematite fig 8d we found that the iron ion concentration in the leachate the peak concentration increased was affected by increases in the hematite specific surface area while the leaching rate of iron ions in the leachate was affected by increasing the pyrite specific surface area the slope of the iron ion concentration curve decreased this indicates that fe3 is a strong oxidant that can oxidize insoluble tetravalent uranium into hexavalent uranium thereby promoting uranium leaching marsili et al 2007 sevinc sengör et al 2015 while fe2 promoted reduction and inhibits uranium leaching zhou et al 2019a b the simulation result for fe3 leaching was higher than the experimental result fig 8d which could be caused by decreased the reaction area of hematite attached to by other minerals at the initial stages of isl and resulted in less leaching of fe3 as the minerals attached to the hematite surface dissolved the surface area of hematite increased and the leaching of fe3 increased finally by considering the interactions between minerals the specific surface area of each mineral was fine tuned to make the results more consistent given the lack of spatial distribution data for iron minerals it was assumed that they were uniformly distributed in the ore bearing bed before the simulation and the concentration of fe3 in the leachate of the two production wells was equivalent fig 9 a this matched poorly with the experimental results however if the content of iron minerals in different positions was adjusted i e to consider the heterogeneity of iron mineral content the variation of the fe3 concentration in the leachate from the two production wells could be well simulated fig 9a the uranium concentration of the leachate obtained with a heterogeneous distribution of iron minerals was lower than that obtained with a homogeneous distribution fig 9b which indicates that the heterogeneity of the iron ore sites affected uranium leaching the acquired simulated results which considered the distribution of iron minerals provided a better representation of the uranium leaching law whereas taking the distribution of iron minerals into account led to some errors in the simulation in future research the distribution of iron minerals needs to be perfected 4 2 isl area of influence the influential area is an important factor for uranium deposit mining and benefit evaluation isl occurs in deep underground mines making it difficult to determine the leaching range thus a leaching range determined through numerical simulation can be used as an indicator the influential range is divided into the pollution plume and leaching area based on solute migration and mineral dissolution the pollution plume contains acidic water and uranium additionally the leaching range includes the acidification area and the uranium ore dissolution area in the simulated calculations the groundwater quality standard and uranium ore dissolution were used to determine the background value to delineate the range i e ph 2 acidification area ph 6 5 pollution plume of acidic water uranyl ion 5 mg l 1 pollution plume of u and u dissolution 10 7 content uraninite 0 20 mg l 1 schoepite 0 23 mg l 1 uranium ore dissolution area 1 pollution plume fig 10 a shows the simulated changes in the water level and velocity of the isl unit under actual pumping and injecting flow the change in the actual pumping and injecting flow rate has a great influence on the evolution of the hydrodynamic field different single well pumping rates and unsynchronised flow rate changes form a falling funnel with the production wells as the center the closer to the production well the faster flow rate and the higher solute concentration will be the plume of acidic water gradually diffused outwards under the action of convection and dispersion the change in sulphuric acid concentration had a negligible impact on the pollution plume when the concentration of injected sulphuric acid was high upon the injection of sulphuric acid the pollution plume gradually expanded to 0 023 km2 at 650 d fig 10b the flow of the production well was conserved in the simulation but the flow rate of the production well was higher than that of the injection well during actual production which resulted in the range of the contamination plume being lower than the simulated value taking the injection well as a centre uranyl ions were generated upon the dissolution of uranium ore uranyl ions migrated to the liquid extraction well along with the groundwater flow field formed by the pumping and injection cycle the hydrodynamic effects near the production well were strong and the migration rate of uranyl ions was rapid which led to a high degree of uranium extraction by the production well fig 10c these results showed that when the leaching area of uranium ore is calculated it is necessary to consider the hydrodynamic effects in the coverage area including the flow of uranyl ions back to the production well the pollution plume of uranium gradually increased over time expanding to 0 03 km2 at 650 d fig 10f as it was affected by acid consumption during mineral dissolution the pollution plume of u was larger than that of acidic water which indicated the existence of acidic uranium pollution areas 0 023 km2 and non acidic uranium pollution areas 0 007 km2 in acid isl pollution areas 2 uranium ore leaching area fig 10d shows the simulated changes of uranium ore dissolution and flow rate in a single day under the actual pumping and injecting flow rate a faster flow rate could lead to a stronger hydrodynamic force and a higher dissolution of uranium ore in a single day which was mostly concentrated near the production wells moreover a slower flow rate induced a weaker hydrodynamic force and thus a smaller amount of uranium was dissolved in a single day which was primarily concentrated at the edge of the falling funnel formed by the production well therefore the leaching area of uranium ore could be taken as the accumulated area of uranium ore dissolution during mining taking the injection well as a centre the injected sulphuric acid flowed in the direction of the groundwater flow field formed by the pumping and injection cycle on the 25th day all production wells met the requirements of isl acidification ph 2 the acidification area was 5 05 10 3 km2 range of the acidification area gradually increased over time fig 10b the area reached a maximum of 8 0 10 3 km2 at 264 5 d as the concentration of the injected sulphuric acid decreased the acidification area decreased and eventually stabilised at an area of 6 3 10 3 km2 fig 10f this effect showed that the acidification area was affected by the concentration of the injected sulphuric acid specifically a higher concentration leads to a larger acidification area a comparison of the acidified area with the polluted plume of acidic water revealed that the range of groundwater that met the requirements of acid isl was much smaller than that of the polluted plume the purpose of isl was to extract uranium from the ore bed the leaching area was delineated by the change in uranium ore dissolution which can be used to quantify the mining extent of the deposit the simulated uranium ore was divided into uraninite and schoepite because the leaching area of uraninite was larger than that of schoepite fig 10f the leaching area of uraninite was used in the analysis with the injection well as a centre the leaching area and the leaching amount of uranium ore gradually increased fig 10e the leaching areas reached 9 804 10 3 km2 and 9 817 10 3 km2 at 300 d and 650 d respectively fig 10f the maximum changes in uranium dissolution were 197 54 and 389 0 mg l 1 at 315 and 235 m respectively which indicated that the uranium leaching area gradually stabilised and the uranium in the covered area had dissolved 4 3 sensitivity analysis the detailed structure of the rtm for the in situ tests required the consideration of various parameters all of which have significant uncertainties from this perspective a sensitivity analysis was done to quantify the parameters of the model and investigate the influence of each parameter on the leaching uranium concentration including the concentration of the leaching solution sulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide leaching ions ca2 fe3 fe2 al3 and so4 2 porosity n reaction specific surface area as and volume fraction of minerals figs 11 and 12 1 impact of sulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide sulphuric acid was used as a leaching agent which directly affected the leaching of uranium in the acid leaching process the changes in its concentration affected the groundwater acidification environment the sulphuric acid concentration of the original model was changed by 10 to explore its influence on uranium release further hydrogen peroxide is a commonly utilized oxidant to improve the uranium leaching rate based on the original model the addition of hydrogen peroxide was simulated such that the concentration was zero or changed by 10 to determine its influence on uranium release the simulation revealed that the leaching rate of uranium increased as the sulphuric acid concentration increased and vice versa this was related to the fact that at higher concentrations sulphuric acid released more hydrogen ions to promote uranium dissolution and the sulphate radicals needed for uranyl complexation fig 11a the increase in the hydrogen peroxide concentration could effectively promote uranium leaching when a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide was added the leaching solution contained more dissolved oxygen this will increase the eh value of the solution and oxidize more uranium which made uranium easier to dissolve and release from the uranium ore fig 11b under the same leaching conditions sulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide were both enhanced by 10 the leaching of uranium was increased by 5 75 as the sulphuric acid concentration increased while the leaching of uranium was increased by 0 75 as the hydrogen peroxide concentration increased thus by increasing the concentration of sulphuric acid the leaching effect of uranium could be improved more significantly as compared to hydrogen peroxide fig 11a and b the concentration of uranium leached with hydrogen peroxide was markedly higher than that without hydrogen peroxide between 66 and 200 d which indicated that hydrogen peroxide could effectively promote uranium leaching fig 12 hydrogen peroxide was added from 67 to 131 d during the field trial and stopped at 132 d the simulated results showed that the leachate uranium concentration with hydrogen peroxide was higher than that without the addition of hydrogen peroxide this effect lasted until 300 d therefore the oxidation effect following hydrogen peroxide addition continued to affect uranium leaching fig 12 from the sensitivity analysis of the uranium leaching to the leaching solution it could be seen that sulphuric acid was the principal acid leaching agent of uranium ore and determined the extent of uranium leaching a relatively high concentration of sulphuric acid led to the release of more hydrogen ions and sulfate radicals which was beneficial to the dissolution and migration of uranium in addition the use of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant not only effectively improved the eh value of the solution but also promoted the dissolution and migration of uranium under acid leaching conditions 2 impact of porosity the velocity of the solution in the pores also affects uranium leaching although the reaction kinetics control the dissolution rate of minerals solute transport is still affected by the pore velocity ben simon et al 2014 at a constant pumping and injection rate the effective porosity affects the pore velocity and hydrochemical environment generally decreasing porosity will increase the pore velocity and leads to an increase in the solute transport speed the hydrochemical environment of the ore bed will be replaced by the leaching agent more frequently which will further affect the water rock reaction therefore it was necessary to test the influence of porosity changes based on an initial effective porosity of 0 15 this value was changed by 10 fig 11c the simulation revealed that at the same pumping and injection rate the flow velocity increased as the porosity decreased an increase in the flow velocity in the low permeability ore bed promoted the kinetic reaction and consumption of acid which led to an increase in uranium leaching and vice versa in this work only the porosity was changed in the model whereas the blocking of circulation pores by mineral precipitation was not considered therefore the only conclusion that could be drawn was that the different porosities of ore beds influenced uranium leaching the impact of pore changes in the leaching process needs further study 3 impact of the reaction surface area and volume fraction of various minerals sensitive minerals that affect the ph or redox capacity of the solution also influence uranium leaching the roles of the two groups of minerals in uranium leaching were explored by changing their content and reaction rate 1 carbonate calcite and silicate albite k feldspar and kaolinite which have a buffering effect on the ph 2 iron oxide hematite and pyrite which have a redox buffering effect the reaction rate of minerals in the model was quantified using the reaction kinetics therefore the reaction rate constant was an influencing parameter and the impact of changing the reaction specific surface area as 10 of minerals in the original model was compared fig 11d the simulation results revealed that an increase in the reaction surface area of uraninite and schoepite promoted uranium leaching which indicated that a larger reaction surface area of uranium could lead to a stronger uranium reaction as a result more uranium leaching will occur additionally when its reaction surface area was increased uraninite rather than schoepite promoted uranium leaching indicating that uraninite is more sensitive to changes in the uranium leaching concentration with increases in the reaction surface area of the associated minerals non uranium minerals the competition with uranium for acids and oxidants was more intense and thus inhibited its leaching the order of influence from strong to weak was k feldspar albite calcite and pyrite hematite and kaolinite had no obvious impacts the volume fraction of minerals directly affected the consumption of acids the content of each mineral in the simulation was adjusted to determine the influence of the volume fraction of the associated minerals on uranium leaching fig 11e the simulation revealed that the output of leached uranium increased when the content of uranium ore uraninite and schoepite in the ore bed increased additionally when the volume fraction of the uranium ore changed uraninite had a more significant impact on leaching uranium than schoepite indicating that the leached uranium mainly came from uraninite the associated minerals competed with uranium for acids and oxidants and led to a decrease in uranium leaching as the volume fraction increased the leaching of uranium was inhibited more significantly the inhibition effect from strong to weak was k feldspar albite calcite and pyrite hematite and kaolinite had no noticeable influence on uranium leaching the sensitivity analysis also showed that the reaction surface area and volume fraction of uranium ore were the key factors affecting the leaching of uranium under the same leaching environment the volume fraction of uranium ore correlated with the content consequently a high content could lead to the enhanced production of leached uranium in terms of the reaction kinetics the reaction rate constant of the uranium ore was affected by temperature while the change in the groundwater temperature during in situ leaching was negligible because of the small change in groundwater temperature during the process of in situ leaching its influence could be ignored therefore the reaction surface area of uranium ore directly affected the reaction rate a larger reaction surface area is directly associated with a faster reaction rate which implies a higher concentration of leached uranium 4 impact of circulating leaching ions there is a lack of research consensus regarding the production and simulation of the extraction and re leaching process the chemical composition of the leaching solution used in actual mining operations differs from that of the acidic solution in the laboratory there is also a recirculation operation in the isl process sinclair and thompson 2015 after uranium is extracted from the leachate the solution is re acidified and re injected into the ore bed at this time ca2 fe3 fe2 al3 and so4 2 which are already present in the acidic solution will affect the dissolution and precipitation of minerals mixing the re leaching solution the residual solution after uranium extraction with the leaching solution increases the concentration of non extracted ions during production the reinjection of these ions increases the salinity of groundwater which will eventually affect the leaching accordingly in the simulation this recirculation operation should be accounted for forming a complete isl system however as the uranium extraction process is complex and difficult to simulate the isl operation is generally assumed to be a non cyclic process thus the leaching solution is not re acidified before reinjection therefore there is still a long term necessity to explore the influence of leaching ions on uranium leaching based on the original model an additional 0 01 mol l 1 of each ion was added to the unidirectional leaching simulation to determine the influence of these ions on uranium leaching fig 11f the simulation revealed that the injection of fe2 inhibited uranium leaching which was mainly related to that fe2 decreased the eh value of the solution the injection of so4 2 promoted uranium leaching the complexation of so4 2 with uranyl ions could promote uranium leaching however the pore blockage caused by precipitation was not considered in this study when excessive sulphate ions were formed in the solution the kinetics of the sulphate complexation reaction were more dynamic than those of uranium hydrolysis munoz et al 1995 shying 1973 suzuki et al 1990 therefore the injection of sulphates promoted the leaching reaction mishra et al 2013 the injection of al3 inhibited uranium leaching due to the complexation reaction between al3 and so4 2 and competitive complexation with uranium without considering the pore blockage caused by precipitation the injection of ca2 and fe3 had little impact on uranium leaching generally ca2 and fe3 will generate gypsum and iron mineral deposits which will further affect uranium leaching fe2 had a significant negative influence on uranium leaching as shown by the sensitivity analysis of circulating leaching ions whereas other ions had little effect since the model did not consider the issue of precipitation blockage the impact of gypsum precipitation generated by the reaction of ca2 and so4 2 on uranium leaching needs to be further studied 5 conclusion a kinetic reactive transport model was constructed to qualitatively assess acid isl mining in bayan uul china the simulated and measured concentrations of ph u6 ca2 al3 and fe3 in the pumping exhibited similar trends which indicates that the model reproduced a dynamic leaching process for uranium mining the area influenced by isl predicted by the model could be divided into the uranium leaching area 9 817 10 3 km2 acidification area 6 3 10 3 km2 pollution plume of acid water 0 023 km2 and pollution plume of uranium 0 03 km2 showing that the leaching area of uranium was much larger than that of acidification and the pollution plume of uranium and acidic water produced was larger than that of the leaching area this result provides guidance for isl mining schemes for deposits further the local sensitivity analysis demonstrated that sulphuric acid had the most significant influence on uranium leaching hydrogen peroxide in conjunction with sulphuric acid could improve the uranium leaching efficiency the volume fraction and the reaction rate of the uranium ore were the main factors affecting uranium leaching leached uranium mainly comes from uraninite followed by schoepite at the same pumping and injection rates the ore bed with a lower porosity had a faster flow rate stronger water rock reactions and more remarkable leaching of uranium without considering the blockage of pores by precipitation fe2 in the circulating leaching had the most significant negative impact on uranium leaching followed by al3 while the complexation of so4 2 with uranyl ions promoted uranium leaching and ca2 and fe3 had little effect on uranium leaching declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

2671,acid in situ leaching isl can be used as a mining technique for in situ uranium recover from underground acids and oxidants as lixiviants were continuously injected into a sandstone type uranium deposit in bayan uul china it was conducted to facilitate the dissolution of uranium minerals to generate uranyl ions which could then be extracted for the recovery of uranium resources by the pumping cycle a reactive transport model based on phast was developed to investigate the dynamic reactive migration process of uranium the simulated results well reproduce the fluid dynamic evolution in the injecting and pumping units as well as the dynamic release of uranium the simulated leaching area indicates that the uranium ore leaching area was much larger than the acidification area in addition the pollution plume of uranium and acid water was larger than that of the leaching area which can be used as a reference for uranium mining schemes furthermore the parameter sensitivity analysis indicates the volume fraction of uranium ore and the reaction rate were the main factors affecting uranium leaching efficiency without considering the blockage of pores by precipitation the fe2 in the reinjection fluid had a significant negative influence on uranium leaching keywords banyan uul uranium deposit acid in situ leaching reactive transport influence area sensitivity analysis

is regarded to be an important strategic nuclear power resource monnet et al 2017 boghi et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 zeng et al 2021 it is widely distributed in the earth s crust while the estimates of its abundance lie between 2 and 4 ppm fleischer 1995 clark et al 2006 in recent times modern uranium production has usually relied on sandstone hosted deposits adams 1991 lovley and phillips 1992 currently owing to conventional mining environmental issues such as tailings large surface disturbances and water pollution kidd 2009 iaea 2016 2001 it s difficult to implement conventional mining methods i e open pit and underground mining to meet the standards of mining sandstone type uranium deposits as a result the conventional methods are gradually being replaced by the in situ leaching isl technique now isl has become the preferred mining technology for uranium deposits of the sandstone type saunders et al 2016 lagneau et al 2019 to date 57 4 of the world s uranium deposit is mined by isl nea and iaea 2020 however the origins of the hydrogeochemical processes occurring during uranium leaching and uranium migration in deep underground ore layers are poorly understood therefore it is challenging to optimize the isl process and predict the leaching range zhou et al 2019a developing effective technical means for studying isl operations is imperative the principle of isl is as follows a leaching solution is initially injected into an ore bearing aquifer through injection wells relying on the circulation of fluids for controlling the seepage in hydrogeochemical fields of the ore bed a chemical environment conducive to the dissolution and migration of uranium is created then the uranium enriched leachate is extracted through several production wells to achieve in situ recovery wellmer and becker platen 2002 bhargava et al 2015 iaea 2018a b isl is subdivided into the acid method and the alkali method according to the nature of the injected leaching solution at present acid isl is more widely used in certain countries including uzbekistan kazakhstan australia and china due to its relatively low mining requirements no need for a mining fleet milling capacity and heavy preparatory work such as removing the overburden for open pit mines and developing access shafts for underground mining low reagent costs and high leaching rate mudd 2001a b the lixiviant usually includes sulphuric acid and other acids such as hydrochloric and nitric acids which are more expensive and would pose more environmental challenges edwards and oliver 2000 iaea 2005 hydrogeological scientific issues affecting isl can be abstracted through the coupling of solute transport and geochemical reactions xu et al 2012 liu et al 2014 yuan et al 2017 langanay et al 2021 this issue concering the uranium mining process can be explored using the reactive transport model rtm panfilov et al 2016 johnson and tutu 2016 dangelmayr et al 2017 tungatarova et al 2020 shayakhmetov et al 2020 isl is considered a highly efficient mining technology iaea 2001 heili 2018 however some radionuclides and heavy metals are released by the reaction between the injected leaching solution and ore which could directly enter groundwater under the action of hydrodynamic and geochemical processes leading to groundwater pollution mudd 2001a b therefore it is essential to predict the influence of isl mining on groundwater quality in a given mining area johnson et al 2010 developed an rtm to simulate the changes in water quality and the contaminant plume migration after uranium mining near edgemont south dakota however the pollution induced by mining operation has gradually become a factor used to rationally optimize the isl mining process and predict the temporal spatial evolution of leaching uranium johnson and tutu 2013 established a one dimensional rtm to determine the evolution and migration of uranium in the leacheate based on two different geochemical databases and various geochemical parameters nevertheless the developed model only indicated that the spatial temporal evolution of uranium leaching was random under the manifestation of various geochemical conditions ben simon et al 2014 used geochemical reaction simulation batch experiments to calibrate the reaction kinetics law and applied this to the simulation of an rtm and successfully simulated the hydrogeochemical transport process of the in situ recovery isr process on the laboratory scale the simulation results help to elucidate the uranium dissolution precipitation mechanisms during the migration process lagneau et al 2019 built a block scale rtm for the katco mine in southern kazakhstan to identify the main transport process of industrially produced uranium and successfully translated this from a laboratory simulation to a field simulation however the prediction of the uranium leaching area and pollution plume are rarely discussed simultaneously dong et al 2016 therefore it is imperative to quantitatively determine the leaching and pollution range through numerical simulation to gain a better understanding of uranium mining planning and groundwater pollution delineation from this perspective it is necessary to build a geological model before establishing an rtm model owing to the complex geological structure of uranium deposits langanay et al 2021 used a stochastic geostatistical model coupled with rtm and obtained a good approximation of uranium production variability when studying the geological structure model of uranium deposits however the intrinsic parameters of the numerical model were complex and uncertain which resulted in a large calculation burden and the inability to make timely and effective predictions thus simplifying the secondary factors to optimise the model without affecting the simulation results remains indispensable the sensitivity analysis can effectively distinguish the degree of influence of different parameters on modelling results more specifically through a sensitivity analysis of the co2 o2 leaching process of four isl units in the qianjiadian sandstone type uranium deposit mining area qiu et al 2021 found that the uranium content controlled uranium release and migration and the oxygen concentration controlled uranium oxidation and dissolution these findings facilitated the optimisation of large scale mining area simulations similarly it is imperative to simplify the secondary factors through sensitivity analysis to optimize the complex uranium leaching model by the acid method this will provide guidance for subsequent large scale mining area simulations as a long term mining area the mining technology in the bayan uul sandstone type uranium deposit in inner mongolia is relatively mature however a basis for the qualitative analysis of uranium dynamic leaching and the delineation of the mining scope is lacking to achieve these goals an isl field trial was conducted using h2so4 and h2o2 as the leaching agents an rtm based on the phast multi component transport model package was developed to simulate the field trial therefore the objectives of this work are to 1 investigate the dynamic release process of an acid isl process based on the reactive transport modelling 2 identify the influential scope posed by isl and 3 characterize the key factors influencing uranium leaching 2 field test description 2 1 hydrogeology the field test was conducted in the western region of the manite depression in the erlian basin inner mongolia which is an interlayer oxidation zone type uranium deposit fig 1 currently one of the sandstone type uranium deposits is suitable for isl in the erlian basin guo 2014 it is primarily controlled by sand bodies of the paleo valley in the upper part of the saihan formation the formation of the paleo valley was controlled by negative landforms caused by the basement structure the basement strata include the lower cambrian upper carboniferous and lower permian the mesozoic cenozoic sedimentary caprocks with age from the jurassic to the quaternary were developed uranium ore bodies were formed in the paleo valley sand bodies in the upper part of the saihan formation during the lower cretaceous these were developed in the valley sand body under the control of the phreatic interlayer oxidation zones there are three types of groundwater occur in the area bedrock fissure water clastic rock pore water and loose rock pore water clastic rock pore water is the most critical groundwater type in the area and its abundance is controlled by the sedimentary environment the pore water in the clastic rocks of the saihan formation is controlled by the northeast trending paleo valley and is distributed in the middle of the stepwise alpine plain thus the aquifer spreads along a northeast trending belt the lithology of the aquifer consists of a mixed layer of sandstone and sandy conglomerate with a thickness of about 30 80 m there are two to four layers of mudstone and local argillaceous siltstone interlayers groundwater is rich in the confined aquifers with a buried depth of 10 45 m and a high permeability coefficient of 8 9 13 2 m d 1 the average concentrations of na k ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 and cl in groundwater were 512 67 mg l 1 63 20 mg l 1 54 96 mg l 1 511 79 mg l 1 423 36 mg l 1 and 433 10 mg l 1 respectively chen 2017 the groundwater had a salinity of 1 99 g l 1 and the initial ph and eh were 7 03 and 279 83 mv respectively insights from drilling data revealed that the ore bodies were all sandstone with burial depths ranging from 100 to 120 m the thickness of single layer ore bodies ranges from 2 35 to 13 85 m and the cumulative thickness ranges from 5 5 to 15 25 m the average thickness of the effective ore bearing aquifers is 8 67 m units i and ii are a set of six spot pattern isl uranium field trial sites the average uranium content of each borehole in acid isl zheng 2017 are as follows 0 013 cdi 1 0 0139 cdi 2 0 0144 zdi 1 0 0138 zdi 2 0 0125 zdi 3 0 0191 zdi 4 0 018 zdi 5 0 0168 zdi 6 0 0137 zdi 7 and 0 0108 zdi 1 this indicates that the uranium ore content and cumulative thickness of unit ii are higher than those for unit i because the ore bed of unit i is close to the oxidation zone with a high content of oxidiants substances iron oxides such as hematite and a low content of pyrite the ore bed of unit ii is close to the reduction zone with a high content of reducing substances and a low content of iron oxides fig 2 2 2 isl uranium field trial the isl field trial equipment consisted of an isl well pad hydrometallurgy workshop liquor pool and sulphuric acid tower fig 3 the isl well pad six spot pattern consists of two groups of five injection wells and one production well the distance between the injection wells and the production wells is 30 m and the distance between adjacent injection wells is 35 27 m the test procedure can be described as follows firstly the leaching solution with the required acidity for in situ leaching was prepared in the liquor pool secondly the leaching solution was injected into the ore bearing aquifer via the eight injection wells thirdly the leachate was extracted via the two production wells finally the leachate was transported to the hydrometallurgy workshop for further extraction and processed into uranium products eventually the field trial had run for 650 days the concentration of the leaching agent was continuously adjusted according to the leaching effect of uranium in different periods table 1 at the initial stage 10 g l 1 of sulphuric acid was used to acidify the hydrochemical groundwater environment in the ore bearing aquifer and the acidification lasted 66 d at the middle stage to accelerate the leaching rate of uranium hydrogen peroxide with concentrations of 0 75 and 1 0 g l 1 was added to the leaching solution at the time of 67 91 and 92 131 days respectively the oxidation time was 65 d at the final stage when the acid consuming substances had been greatly reduced the sulphuric acid concentration was decreased to reduce the acid consumption 2 3 field trial results analysis 1 ph and eh the dissolution and precipitation of minerals are controlled by acid and oxidant concentrations respectively the redox of leachate is also controlled by ph and eh ben simon et al 2014 based on this principle the isl process is divided into four successive stages fig 4 a stage 1 is the acidification stage where the high acidity leaching solution replaces the groundwater in the ore bearing strata creating a hydrochemical environment that is conducive to the dissolution of uranium minerals stage 2 is the oxidation stage where the oxidant content in the leaching solution is increased to accelerate the oxidation and dissolution of uranium minerals stage 3 is the rapid dissolution stage when the acidity drops to close to the input value and the eh value increases to the above oxidation reduction potential where the dissolution of uranium minerals is rapidly facilitated stage 4 is the gradual dissolution stage in which the relatively insoluble uranium bearing minerals in the ore bed continue to slowly dissolve 2 uranium leaching the variation uranium concentration in the leachate is shown in fig 4b during the first 15 days of the test acid consuming minerals in the ore bearing aquifer reacted with acid resulting in less uranium leaching 0 5 mg l 1 uranium was leached efficiently after 15 days after adding the oxidant at 67 days stage 1 the leachate uranium concentration increased again peaking at 127 days stage 2 the uranium concentration of well cdi 1 was 26 58 mg l 1 and that of well cdi 2 was 99 74 mg l 1 the concentration of uranium in the leachate decreased continuously after oxidant addition ceased at 132 days indicating that the oxidant could promote uranium leaching further the concentration of sulphuric acid was reduced by 4 5 g l 1 at 169 days which then adjusted itself back to 10 g l 1 at 176 days the concentration of uranium continued to decrease and reached a minimum at 197 days which indicated that it was lagging behind the acidity of the leaching solution however the uranium concentration increased at 197 days again reaching a maximum at 283 days the uranium concentration of well cdi 1 was 27 83 mg l 1 and that of well cdi 2 was 60 mg l 1 after 283 days the uranium concentration of the leachate continued to decrease slowly until the end of the test the variation characteristics of uranium concentration in the cdi 1 and cdi 2 leachate over time were similar but the concentration values were different the uranium concentration in well cdi 2 was higher than that in well cdi 1 which may have been caused by the uneven distribution of uranium deposits the average thicknesses of unit i and unit ii were 7 85 and 12 39 m respectively leading to the difference in uranium content per square meter in the isl unit thus to further explain the influence from the uranium heterogeneity it was necessary to consider these findings in conjunction with those of the model 3 ferric ions the trend of ferric ion fe3 concentration in the leachate as a function of time is shown in fig 4c the concentration of fe3 in the leachate was low in the first 67 days this may be caused by the precipitation of fe oh 3 or the adsorption of fe3 by soil at the initial stage of acidification zhao and li 2021 the concentration of fe3 in well cdi 1 increased quickly at 129 days and that in well cdi 2 increased quickly at 285 days indicating that the dissolved amount of iron bearing minerals were different at various locations more specifically well cdi 1 was close to the oxidation zone and well cdi 2 was close to the reduction zone which resulted in the uneven distribution of iron minerals and a higher concentration of fe3 in the leachate from well cdi 1 than that from cdi 2 therefore to further explain the influence of iron mineral heterogeneity on isl these results need to be considered in the model 4 al3 and ca2 the variations in leachate ca2 and al3 concentrations with time fig 4d and e respectively were as follows during the initial 67 days stage 1 the concentration of ca2 and al3 increased rapidly indicating that the aluminium containing minerals and calcium containing minerals dissolved rapidly at the acidification stage subsequently the concentration of ca2 and al3 increased slowly indicating that the dissolution of aluminium and calcium containing minerals still happens in the leaching process but at a slower rate than that at stage 1 3 kinetic reactive transport modelling 3 1 governing equations the reactive transport model is a system of differential equations describing the flow the thermodynamic equilibria and the reaction kinetics in the mathematical model the equation for the advection dispersion reaction adr migration process of in situ uranium

noiriel et al 2004 2009 these include the dissolution rate of different minerals and the precipitation rate of the newly formed minerals the simulation code phreeqc uses rate laws of the general form 2 r d m dt k a w i β i α i 1 ω n θ η where m is the mole number of the mineral mol l 1 k is the variation in the rate constant with temperature mol m 2 s 1 aw m2 l 1 represents the mineral surface

law and define its nonlinearity they are generally obtained experimentally and are usually equal to 1 ben simon et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 in this work phast software was selected to simulate the uranium leaching which couples the flow and transport code hst3d kipp 1987 1997 as well as the geochemical model phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 parkhurst et al 2010 the model first calculates the flow velocity and based on the groundwater flow field the geochemical reactions and chemical transport are simulated 3 2 modelling strategy two factors must be considered for numerical simulations of uranium leaching by acid isl one is the geological conditions of the uranium deposit mineral distribution and the other is the test phenomena including the geochemical reactions occurring during the experimental process the kinetics of these reactions and the hydrodynamic transport in relation to the reaction kinetics thus the numerical model is coupled with the assignment of mineral content in the grid divisions and the reactive transport equation of groundwater the main difficulty in using this method lies in the random distribution of the mineral content in the deposit and the influence of different mineral reactions on dissolved ions therefore it is necessary to appropriately simplify the model based on the known conditions and to analyse each parameter s impact on the simulation results analyzing the dynamic release process of an acid isl process consists of two essential steps firstly a rtm was developed to simulate the isl field trial and then the influential area of isl was identified secondly sensitivity analysis was used to identify the main factor affecting uranium leaching fig 5 the isl model couples several modules which are described below 1 generalisation of mineral distribution the distribution and content of uranium deposits in the study area differ significantly when establishing the geochemical model the uranium content analysis results of the ore samples at the actual borehole were taken as the known points then the uranium content in the entire simulation area was assigned by regular circular interpolation and linear extrapolation to achieve a heterogeneous generalisation of the uranium deposits fig 6 a in the sample analysis the valence distribution ratio of the measured uranium was 0 71 0 29 hexavalent tetravalent zheng 2017 as schoepite is generally considered to be the most common oxidation product of uranium deditius et al 2007 it was assumed that the tetravalent uranium ore was uraninite and the hexavalent uranium ore was schoepite ben simon et al 2014 in addition to the uranium ore other primary minerals including calcite pyrite hematite albite k feldspar kaolinite and quartz also have a significant impact on the dissolution of uranium ore and should be considered in the model the average content of other minerals was known table 2 but the analysis content at the borehole was unknown it was impossible to know exactly the distribution of additional minerals the changes of ca2 and al3 concentrations in the lixivium at the two production wells were similar ca2 mainly came from calcite and al3 mainly came from albite k feldspar and kaolinite indicating a small distribution difference in these minerals therefore the distribution of calcite albite k feldspar and kaolinite in the ore bearing layer could be generalised as a homogeneous medium the oxidising iron minerals were mostly distributed in well cdi 1 and reducing iron minerals were mostly distributed in well cdi 2 based on the accompanying relationship between the uranium ore and iron the average content of iron was distributed according to the proportion of uranium ore content this enabled the content of iron at each borehole to be assigned and the entire simulation area to be interpolated fig 6a and b 2 hydrodynamic model in the isl test simulation a simplified system was developed to represent the model area of the ore bearing aquifer based on the hydrogeological conditions of the mining process the simulated zone was a cuboid with length of 500 m width of 500 m and height of 8 67 m which was divided into 100 100 grids with a side length of 5 m the boundary of the model was set as a specified head boundary with the same head of 21 m the lateral recharge of adjacent ore bearing layers was assumed to be negligible fig 7 a the flow was uniform and constant throughout the simulation as the actual flow of the injection and production wells of the two isl units fluctuated overtime during the simulation the average value was taken at different time stages for simplification fig 7b the model stress period was set to 650 d and an automatic time step was adopted for time discretisation the transport parameters table 3 used in the hydrodynamic model were the effective porosity peff hydraulic conductivity k dispersivity d and specific storage ss 3 minerals and kinetics the mineral species chemical formulae and solubility constants were extracted from the phreeqc database llnl dat table 4 the kinetic rate is an intrinsic parameter of a mineral framework and its changes are mainly caused by the formation of crystallinity structural defects in addition to changes in the specific surface area ben simon et al 2014 lagneau et al 2019 for in situ experimental modelling the kinetic rate constant under acidic conditions obtained from existing literature was selected as a reference table 4 the extracted simulated results were fitted to the experimental data by adjusting the specific surface area as rather than the kinetic rate constant k many primary minerals were initially present in the ore the main minerals selected for the simplified model were uraninite schoepite calcite pyrite hematite albite k feldspar and kaolinite the precipitation and dissolution of these minerals were assumed to be kinetically controlled schoepite is considered a common oxidation product of uranium deditius et al 2007 janeczek and ewing 1991 since no information related to the kinetics for schoepite dissolution in acidic solutions was found in the literature the kinetics of uraninite were used instead clay minerals are likely to control the silica concentration in leachates and may dissolve or precipitate during acid leaching clay minerals are mainly composed of illite interstratified illite montmorillonite and kaolinite to simplify the model only kaolinite was considered and a high specific surface area 150 m2 mol 1 was applied until the value was equivalent to that of illite and illite montmorillonite the precipitation and dissolution of quartz were assumed to occur under thermodynamic equilibrium due to its relatively slow reaction rates under acidic conditions 4 hydrochemistry the hydrochemistry of the geochemical model comprisesd the initial components in groundwater and the injected leaching solution the main components included na k ca2 mg2 h cl hco3 so4 2 and o2 aq the associated aqueous phase complexes were defined in the thermodynamic database based on the mass conservation and charge conservation principles the concentrations of na and k were taken as 0 23 and 0 28 g l 1 respectively changes of the leaching solution component concentration over time are given in table 1 because the concentration of sulphuric acid decreased when it was mixed with groundwater the ph value was finely adjusted during the simulation in the absence of an oxidant the oxygen concentration of the leaching solution refers to as the saturated dissolved oxygen in water at 25 c 8 25 mg l 1 the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide also results in the release of oxygen since the dissolved oxygen content would be too high if it was directly assigned to the hydrogen peroxide concentration in the simulation this content needed to be appropriately lowered to fit the field trial results in the calibration model 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration model the simulated and measured values of five hydrochemical parameters ph u6 ca2 al3 and fe3 in the trial are presented in fig 8 a comparison of the simulated and measured results indicates that changes in major ions were reasonably captured by the rtm uranium leaching was affected by impurity minerals the concentration of the leaching agent and uranium content therefore the model was modified using the following steps fig 8a 1 calcite dissolved quickly and consumed acid delating groundwater acidification and resulting in a gradual increase in the leachate uranium concentration at the acidification stage 1 0 66 d the calcite content in the simulation was taken as an average for the entire study area which was lower than the actual content and the simulated value of uranium leaching at the initial stage was higher due to lower acid consumption during oxidation stage 2 67 131 d upon the addition of h2o2 solution the eh value of the leaching solution increased resulting in a sharp increase in leaching uranium when the addition of h2o2 ceased at the stage 3 132 175 d the oxidation of the leaching solution decreased and the eh value decreased accordingly the reduction in the reaction rate of the uranium ore led to a sharp decrease in the leachate uranium concentration in this process due to the effect of impurity minerals and oxidants the reaction surface area of uranium minerals could be adjusted to correct the model 2 with changes in the concentration of injected sulphuric acid the concentration of leached uranium first increased and then decreased at the stage 3 176 290 d and 290 330 d indicating that the change in sulphuric acid concentration affected the dynamic release of uranium given that the sulphuric acid injected in the production process mixes with the solution after uranium extraction it is necessary to adjust the sulphuric acid concentration when fitting the results at the stage 4 330 650 d the concentration of sulphuric acid remained unchanged and the concentration of leached uranium gradually decreased this indicated that the content of uranium minerals decreased with the dissolution of uranium minerals during this process the specific surface area of uranium minerals was kept constant and the concentration of sulphuric acid was adjusted by adjusting the parameters of the two processes the simulation results of uranium leaching are in good agreement with the experimental results carbonate calcite is the major acid base buffer in the isl process ma et al 2014 and directly affects the ph value the release of ca2 in the leachate mainly come from the dissolution of carbonate lagneau et al 2019 at the acidification stage the rapid dissolution of calcite delayed the acidification of groundwater which lead to a rapid increase of ca2 content in the leachate and a slow decrease of the ph this indicates that the release of ca2 and the change in ph of the solution can be dynamically controlled by adjusting the reaction surface area of calcite fig 8b with decreases in the calcite content the acid consumption gradually weakens and the ca2 and ph gradually stabilize the simulated results are consistent with the measurement results which shows that it is reasonable to adjust the specific surface area of calcite k feldspar albite and kaolinite will react with sulphuric acid to form al3 which is the main aluminium bearing mineral with the continuous injection of sulphuric acid the mineral content decreases and the concentration of al3 in the leachate increases fig 8c this shows that the dynamic release of al3 can be controlled by adjusting the specific surface area of feldspar and kaolinite iron minerals pyrite and hematite are key redox buffers in acid isl mining eglizaud et al 2006 the dynamic release of iron ions was controlled by adjusting the specific surface area of pyrite and hematite fig 8d we found that the iron ion concentration in the leachate the peak concentration increased was affected by increases in the hematite specific surface area while the leaching rate of iron ions in the leachate was affected by increasing the pyrite specific surface area the slope of the iron ion concentration curve decreased this indicates that fe3 is a strong oxidant that can oxidize insoluble tetravalent uranium into hexavalent uranium thereby promoting uranium leaching marsili et al 2007 sevinc sengör et al 2015 while fe2 promoted reduction and inhibits uranium leaching zhou et al 2019a b the simulation result for fe3 leaching was higher than the experimental result fig 8d which could be caused by decreased the reaction area of hematite attached to by other minerals at the initial stages of isl and resulted in less leaching of fe3 as the minerals attached to the hematite surface dissolved the surface area of hematite increased and the leaching of fe3 increased finally by considering the interactions between minerals the specific surface area of each mineral was fine tuned to make the results more consistent given the lack of spatial distribution data for iron minerals it was assumed that they were uniformly distributed in the ore bearing bed before the simulation and the concentration of fe3 in the leachate of the two production wells was equivalent fig 9 a this matched poorly with the experimental results however if the content of iron minerals in different positions was adjusted i e to consider the heterogeneity of iron mineral content the variation of the fe3 concentration in the leachate from the two production wells could be well simulated fig 9a the uranium concentration of the leachate obtained with a heterogeneous distribution of iron minerals was lower than that obtained with a homogeneous distribution fig 9b which indicates that the heterogeneity of the iron ore sites affected uranium leaching the acquired simulated results which considered the distribution of iron minerals provided a better representation of the uranium leaching law whereas taking the distribution of iron minerals into account led to some errors in the simulation in future research the distribution of iron minerals needs to be perfected 4 2 isl area of influence the influential area is an important factor for uranium deposit mining and benefit evaluation isl occurs in deep underground mines making it difficult to determine the leaching range thus a leaching range determined through numerical simulation can be used as an indicator the influential range is divided into the pollution plume and leaching area based on solute migration and mineral dissolution the pollution plume contains acidic water and uranium additionally the leaching range includes the acidification area and the uranium ore dissolution area in the simulated calculations the groundwater quality standard and uranium ore dissolution were used to determine the background value to delineate the range i e ph 2 acidification area ph 6 5 pollution plume of acidic water uranyl ion 5 mg l 1 pollution plume of u and u dissolution 10 7 content uraninite 0 20 mg l 1 schoepite 0 23 mg l 1 uranium ore dissolution area 1 pollution plume fig 10 a shows the simulated changes in the water level and velocity of the isl unit under actual pumping and injecting flow the change in the actual pumping and injecting flow rate has a great influence on the evolution of the hydrodynamic field different single well pumping rates and unsynchronised flow rate changes form a falling funnel with the production wells as the center the closer to the production well the faster flow rate and the higher solute concentration will be the plume of acidic water gradually diffused outwards under the action of convection and dispersion the change in sulphuric acid concentration had a negligible impact on the pollution plume when the concentration of injected sulphuric acid was high upon the injection of sulphuric acid the pollution plume gradually expanded to 0 023 km2 at 650 d fig 10b the flow of the production well was conserved in the simulation but the flow rate of the production well was higher than that of the injection well during actual production which resulted in the range of the contamination plume being lower than the simulated value taking the injection well as a centre uranyl ions were generated upon the dissolution of uranium ore uranyl ions migrated to the liquid extraction well along with the groundwater flow field formed by the pumping and injection cycle the hydrodynamic effects near the production well were strong and the migration rate of uranyl ions was rapid which led to a high degree of uranium extraction by the production well fig 10c these results showed that when the leaching area of uranium ore is calculated it is necessary to consider the hydrodynamic effects in the coverage area including the flow of uranyl ions back to the production well the pollution plume of uranium gradually increased over time expanding to 0 03 km2 at 650 d fig 10f as it was affected by acid consumption during mineral dissolution the pollution plume of u was larger than that of acidic water which indicated the existence of acidic uranium pollution areas 0 023 km2 and non acidic uranium pollution areas 0 007 km2 in acid isl pollution areas 2 uranium ore leaching area fig 10d shows the simulated changes of uranium ore dissolution and flow rate in a single day under the actual pumping and injecting flow rate a faster flow rate could lead to a stronger hydrodynamic force and a higher dissolution of uranium ore in a single day which was mostly concentrated near the production wells moreover a slower flow rate induced a weaker hydrodynamic force and thus a smaller amount of uranium was dissolved in a single day which was primarily concentrated at the edge of the falling funnel formed by the production well therefore the leaching area of uranium ore could be taken as the accumulated area of uranium ore dissolution during mining taking the injection well as a centre the injected sulphuric acid flowed in the direction of the groundwater flow field formed by the pumping and injection cycle on the 25th day all production wells met the requirements of isl acidification ph 2 the acidification area was 5 05 10 3 km2 range of the acidification area gradually increased over time fig 10b the area reached a maximum of 8 0 10 3 km2 at 264 5 d as the concentration of the injected sulphuric acid decreased the acidification area decreased and eventually stabilised at an area of 6 3 10 3 km2 fig 10f this effect showed that the acidification area was affected by the concentration of the injected sulphuric acid specifically a higher concentration leads to a larger acidification area a comparison of the acidified area with the polluted plume of acidic water revealed that the range of groundwater that met the requirements of acid isl was much smaller than that of the polluted plume the purpose of isl was to extract uranium from the ore bed the leaching area was delineated by the change in uranium ore dissolution which can be used to quantify the mining extent of the deposit the simulated uranium ore was divided into uraninite and schoepite because the leaching area of uraninite was larger than that of schoepite fig 10f the leaching area of uraninite was used in the analysis with the injection well as a centre the leaching area and the leaching amount of uranium ore gradually increased fig 10e the leaching areas reached 9 804 10 3 km2 and 9 817 10 3 km2 at 300 d and 650 d respectively fig 10f the maximum changes in uranium dissolution were 197 54 and 389 0 mg l 1 at 315 and 235 m respectively which indicated that the uranium leaching area gradually stabilised and the uranium in the covered area had dissolved 4 3 sensitivity analysis the detailed structure of the rtm for the in situ tests required the consideration of various parameters all of which have significant uncertainties from this perspective a sensitivity analysis was done to quantify the parameters of the model and investigate the influence of each parameter on the leaching uranium concentration including the concentration of the leaching solution sulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide leaching ions ca2 fe3 fe2 al3 and so4 2 porosity n reaction specific surface area as and volume fraction of minerals figs 11 and 12 1 impact of sulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide sulphuric acid was used as a leaching agent which directly affected the leaching of uranium in the acid leaching process the changes in its concentration affected the groundwater acidification environment the sulphuric acid concentration of the original model was changed by 10 to explore its influence on uranium release further hydrogen peroxide is a commonly utilized oxidant to improve the uranium leaching rate based on the original model the addition of hydrogen peroxide was simulated such that the concentration was zero or changed by 10 to determine its influence on uranium release the simulation revealed that the leaching rate of uranium increased as the sulphuric acid concentration increased and vice versa this was related to the fact that at higher concentrations sulphuric acid released more hydrogen ions to promote uranium dissolution and the sulphate radicals needed for uranyl complexation fig 11a the increase in the hydrogen peroxide concentration could effectively promote uranium leaching when a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide was added the leaching solution contained more dissolved oxygen this will increase the eh value of the solution and oxidize more uranium which made uranium easier to dissolve and release from the uranium ore fig 11b under the same leaching conditions sulphuric acid and hydrogen peroxide were both enhanced by 10 the leaching of uranium was increased by 5 75 as the sulphuric acid concentration increased while the leaching of uranium was increased by 0 75 as the hydrogen peroxide concentration increased thus by increasing the concentration of sulphuric acid the leaching effect of uranium could be improved more significantly as compared to hydrogen peroxide fig 11a and b the concentration of uranium leached with hydrogen peroxide was markedly higher than that without hydrogen peroxide between 66 and 200 d which indicated that hydrogen peroxide could effectively promote uranium leaching fig 12 hydrogen peroxide was added from 67 to 131 d during the field trial and stopped at 132 d the simulated results showed that the leachate uranium concentration with hydrogen peroxide was higher than that without the addition of hydrogen peroxide this effect lasted until 300 d therefore the oxidation effect following hydrogen peroxide addition continued to affect uranium leaching fig 12 from the sensitivity analysis of the uranium leaching to the leaching solution it could be seen that sulphuric acid was the principal acid leaching agent of uranium ore and determined the extent of uranium leaching a relatively high concentration of sulphuric acid led to the release of more hydrogen ions and sulfate radicals which was beneficial to the dissolution and migration of uranium in addition the use of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant not only effectively improved the eh value of the solution but also promoted the dissolution and migration of uranium under acid leaching conditions 2 impact of porosity the velocity of the solution in the pores also affects uranium leaching although the reaction kinetics control the dissolution rate of minerals solute transport is still affected by the pore velocity ben simon et al 2014 at a constant pumping and injection rate the effective porosity affects the pore velocity and hydrochemical environment generally decreasing porosity will increase the pore velocity and leads to an increase in the solute transport speed the hydrochemical environment of the ore bed will be replaced by the leaching agent more frequently which will further affect the water rock reaction therefore it was necessary to test the influence of porosity changes based on an initial effective porosity of 0 15 this value was changed by 10 fig 11c the simulation revealed that at the same pumping and injection rate the flow velocity increased as the porosity decreased an increase in the flow velocity in the low permeability ore bed promoted the kinetic reaction and consumption of acid which led to an increase in uranium leaching and vice versa in this work only the porosity was changed in the model whereas the blocking of circulation pores by mineral precipitation was not considered therefore the only conclusion that could be drawn was that the different porosities of ore beds influenced uranium leaching the impact of pore changes in the leaching process needs further study 3 impact of the reaction surface area and volume fraction of various minerals sensitive minerals that affect the ph or redox capacity of the solution also influence uranium leaching the roles of the two groups of minerals in uranium leaching were explored by changing their content and reaction rate 1 carbonate calcite and silicate albite k feldspar and kaolinite which have a buffering effect on the ph 2 iron oxide hematite and pyrite which have a redox buffering effect the reaction rate of minerals in the model was quantified using the reaction kinetics therefore the reaction rate constant was an influencing parameter and the impact of changing the reaction specific surface area as 10 of minerals in the original model was compared fig 11d the simulation results revealed that an increase in the reaction surface area of uraninite and schoepite promoted uranium leaching which indicated that a larger reaction surface area of uranium could lead to a stronger uranium reaction as a result more uranium leaching will occur additionally when its reaction surface area was increased uraninite rather than schoepite promoted uranium leaching indicating that uraninite is more sensitive to changes in the uranium leaching concentration with increases in the reaction surface area of the associated minerals non uranium minerals the competition with uranium for acids and oxidants was more intense and thus inhibited its leaching the order of influence from strong to weak was k feldspar albite calcite and pyrite hematite and kaolinite had no obvious impacts the volume fraction of minerals directly affected the consumption of acids the content of each mineral in the simulation was adjusted to determine the influence of the volume fraction of the associated minerals on uranium leaching fig 11e the simulation revealed that the output of leached uranium increased when the content of uranium ore uraninite and schoepite in the ore bed increased additionally when the volume fraction of the uranium ore changed uraninite had a more significant impact on leaching uranium than schoepite indicating that the leached uranium mainly came from uraninite the associated minerals competed with uranium for acids and oxidants and led to a decrease in uranium leaching as the volume fraction increased the leaching of uranium was inhibited more significantly the inhibition effect from strong to weak was k feldspar albite calcite and pyrite hematite and kaolinite had no noticeable influence on uranium leaching the sensitivity analysis also showed that the reaction surface area and volume fraction of uranium ore were the key factors affecting the leaching of uranium under the same leaching environment the volume fraction of uranium ore correlated with the content consequently a high content could lead to the enhanced production of leached uranium in terms of the reaction kinetics the reaction rate constant of the uranium ore was affected by temperature while the change in the groundwater temperature during in situ leaching was negligible because of the small change in groundwater temperature during the process of in situ leaching its influence could be ignored therefore the reaction surface area of uranium ore directly affected the reaction rate a larger reaction surface area is directly associated with a faster reaction rate which implies a higher concentration of leached uranium 4 impact of circulating leaching ions there is a lack of research consensus regarding the production and simulation of the extraction and re leaching process the chemical composition of the leaching solution used in actual mining operations differs from that of the acidic solution in the laboratory there is also a recirculation operation in the isl process sinclair and thompson 2015 after uranium is extracted from the leachate the solution is re acidified and re injected into the ore bed at this time ca2 fe3 fe2 al3 and so4 2 which are already present in the acidic solution will affect the dissolution and precipitation of minerals mixing the re leaching solution the residual solution after uranium extraction with the leaching solution increases the concentration of non extracted ions during production the reinjection of these ions increases the salinity of groundwater which will eventually affect the leaching accordingly in the simulation this recirculation operation should be accounted for forming a complete isl system however as the uranium extraction process is complex and difficult to simulate the isl operation is generally assumed to be a non cyclic process thus the leaching solution is not re acidified before reinjection therefore there is still a long term necessity to explore the influence of leaching ions on uranium leaching based on the original model an additional 0 01 mol l 1 of each ion was added to the unidirectional leaching simulation to determine the influence of these ions on uranium leaching fig 11f the simulation revealed that the injection of fe2 inhibited uranium leaching which was mainly related to that fe2 decreased the eh value of the solution the injection of so4 2 promoted uranium leaching the complexation of so4 2 with uranyl ions could promote uranium leaching however the pore blockage caused by precipitation was not considered in this study when excessive sulphate ions were formed in the solution the kinetics of the sulphate complexation reaction were more dynamic than those of uranium hydrolysis munoz et al 1995 shying 1973 suzuki et al 1990 therefore the injection of sulphates promoted the leaching reaction mishra et al 2013 the injection of al3 inhibited uranium leaching due to the complexation reaction between al3 and so4 2 and competitive complexation with uranium without considering the pore blockage caused by precipitation the injection of ca2 and fe3 had little impact on uranium leaching generally ca2 and fe3 will generate gypsum and iron mineral deposits which will further affect uranium leaching fe2 had a significant negative influence on uranium leaching as shown by the sensitivity analysis of circulating leaching ions whereas other ions had little effect since the model did not consider the issue of precipitation blockage the impact of gypsum precipitation generated by the reaction of ca2 and so4 2 on uranium leaching needs to be further studied 5 conclusion a kinetic reactive transport model was constructed to qualitatively assess acid isl mining in bayan uul china the simulated and measured concentrations of ph u6 ca2 al3 and fe3 in the pumping exhibited similar trends which indicates that the model reproduced a dynamic leaching process for uranium mining the area influenced by isl predicted by the model could be divided into the uranium leaching area 9 817 10 3 km2 acidification area 6 3 10 3 km2 pollution plume of acid water 0 023 km2 and pollution plume of uranium 0 03 km2 showing that the leaching area of uranium was much larger than that of acidification and the pollution plume of uranium and acidic water produced was larger than that of the leaching area this result provides guidance for isl mining schemes for deposits further the local sensitivity analysis demonstrated that sulphuric acid had the most significant influence on uranium leaching hydrogen peroxide in conjunction with sulphuric acid could improve the uranium leaching efficiency the volume fraction and the reaction rate of the uranium ore were the main factors affecting uranium leaching leached uranium mainly comes from uraninite followed by schoepite at the same pumping and injection rates the ore bed with a lower porosity had a faster flow rate stronger water rock reactions and more remarkable leaching of uranium without considering the blockage of pores by precipitation fe2 in the circulating leaching had the most significant negative impact on uranium leaching followed by al3 while the complexation of so4 2 with uranyl ions promoted uranium leaching and ca2 and fe3 had little effect on uranium leaching declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

2672,in river hydraulic structures may negatively impact aquatic ecosystems including changing river flow regimes and the habitat quality of endemic fish habitats this study integrates the wavelet analysis and the time series exceedance probability method to quantify the degree of evolution in the river flow regime caused by weirs and determine the critical time scale most affected in the environmental flow hydrodynamic and habitat models were conducted to analyze the influence of the variant flow characteristics between the dry and wet seasons on the habitat structure four endemic fishes were selected as the indicator species to represent different habitat preferences and reveal the spatiotemporal changes in habitat quality the flow difference between dry and wet seasons became more extensive after the weir construction indicating the alternative flow regime downstream the annual deviation of daily flow dramatically raised showing the flow rates decline in the dry season and enlarge in the wet season the findings exhibit that the downstream flow amplitude changes regardless of time scale after constructing the weir the flow data from the 2 days scale to the 1 week scale were most adjusted meaning that these periods to meet the environmental flow decline significantly the critical environmental flow corresponding to lower flow events was apparently influenced in the dry season in which the q75 and q90 displayed the highest degradation in fish habitat quality in addition the simulation results of the habitat model found that glide is the primary habitat type the total water area and the habitat diversity were reduced while the habitat quality also had a lowered tendency after the weir operation the habitat run was most degraded and the riffle was also

supporting human society and healthy ecosystems can directly or indirectly enhance human well being and maintain social functioning müller and burkhard 2012 costanza et al 1997 water resources are fundamental driving forces for sustaining a healthy aquatic ecosystem requiring integrative concepts for their conservation geist 2011 to effectively solve the problem of providing water for human consumption in river structures such as weirs have functions that contribute to human development such as power generation flood control and recreation unfortunately freshwater resources are scarce and the rapid growth of cities has increased the per capita water demand which may generate water conflicts postel et al 1996 alcamo et al 2003 global climate change may bring more consequences on the river flow regime leading to escalating demands for hydraulic engineering and increasing environmental stress on aquatic ecosystems mccarthy et al 2001 malmqvist and rundle 2002 climate change related changes can be further exacerbated by dam and weir construction in light of the worldwide expansion of hydropower where changes in downstream flow regimes and upstream hydropeaking need to become better integrated into management decisions geist 2021 pander et al 2022 to meet the increasing demand for human water resources measuring and making reasonable choices for supporting healthy aquatic ecosystems is a problem that must be prudent in the world today several studies have found that changes in natural flow regimes caused by in river hydraulic structures such as reservoirs and weirs worsen river corridor and threaten ecosystem biodiversity ligon et al 1995 poff et al 1997 batalla et al 2004 magilligan and nislow 2005 graf 2006 singer 2007 petts 2009 botter et al 2010 fitzhugh and vogel 2011 kuo et al 2021 barriers of weirs often cause changes in river morphology and biogeochemical characteristics of floodplains and block river continuity resulting in a significant reduction or extinction of migratory fish populations and other related organisms petts 2009 yeager 1994 yi et al 2010 besides the alteration in flow regimes caused by weirs may further induce discontinuities in physical conditions such as water depth flow velocity sediment transport and nutrient delivery triggering a series of adverse ecological impacts im et al 2011 in addition to the direct effects on physicochemical habitat quality fish and macroinvertebrate communities there are also more subtle effects of weirs on primary production and the biodiversity of stream ecosystems mueller et al 2011 the significant effect of these in river structures on the river flow regime is essential however the extent of influence of spatiotemporal flow regime variations on the system and quality of river habitats is still lacking how to mitigate the impact of flow regulation has been an important topic discussed by researchers for many years jowett 1997 the temporal and spatial scales regarding harmful river corridors and aquatic ecosystems are critical of academic and engineering concerns kuo et al 2021 poff et al 1997 suggested that a natural flow regime not affected by human beings can be composed of hydrological indicators with five parameters such as magnitude frequency duration and time rate of change wavelet analysis wa provides a powerful tool for the simultaneous detection of hydrological alteration on multiple time scales and has been increasingly utilized in recent years nakken 1999 white et al 2005 steel and lange 2007 wa reflects local fluctuations inherent in non stationary processes and effectively zooms in or out on detailed changes at specific time scales zolezzi et al 2009 shiau and huang 2014 since wa does not need to pre set the width of the time frame and can display time frequency information simultaneously it can effectively analyze unsteady signals white et al 2005 therefore compared with the traditional fourier transform wa offers more effective interpretation capability in multiple time series analysis kumar and foufoula georgiou 1993 saco and kumar 2000 gaucherel 2002 coulibaly and burn 2004 veneziano et al 2006 venugopal et al 2006 wa furnishes several opportunities to study local aperiodic and multiscale detailed processes mallat and zhang 1993 kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 by allowing the width of the wavelet to increase with the period of wider fourier transform for more efficient and precise localization of dominant modes kaiser 1994 lau and weng 1995 for example wu et al 2015 employed wavelet power spectrum wps to detect hydrological changes at multiple scales they developed an index of globally averaged deviation between wavelet power spectra based on the wps concept to analyze the dynamic flow regime of the feicui reservoir in taiwan the primary purposes of this study are 1 using the exceedance probability method and wavelet analysis method to figure out the time scale of the significant alteration in the flow regime caused by the in river weir and the corresponding variation of environmental flows e flows 2 integrating the hydrodynamic model and the habitat model to analyze the effects on the river habitat structure and fish habitat quality caused by the adjustment of flow regime and e flow we also discuss issues in river management that the hydrological alteration and structural habitat dynamics imply and inspire accordingly 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area is about 20 km between yuanshan weir and xinhai bridge in the middle reaches of the dahan river in northern taiwan as shown in fig 1 a the dahan river is one of the principal tributaries of the tanshuei river basin with a total length of 135 km and a drainage area of 1 163 square kilometers the slope of the river bed ranges from 0 1 to 0 6 the primary function of yuanshan weir is to store the discharge water from the shimen reservoir and send it to banxin water supply plant for treatment and utilization it is one of the primary water sources provided in metropolitan taipei as far as northern taiwan is concerned in the present study the low rainfall period from november to april of the following year is defined as the dry season while the rainy period from may to october is the wet season lee et al 2019 this study collects the daily flow data from january 1 1970 to december 31 1995 at sanying bridge station downstream of the weir wra moea 2014 twenty six years of daily flow data collected were divided into two time intervals the construction of the yuanshan weir in 1983 was used to separate into 13 years before bwc and 13 years after awc to compare the flow pattern dynamics of the downstream channels as shown in fig 2 the elevation of the adjacent cross section in 2017 developed by the tenth river management office water resources agency ministry of economic affairs taiwan was used as the benchmark reference the benchmark elevation and water level records were obtained from the taiwanese fundamental benchmark of keelung this absolute benchmark was determined by the mean sea level and has been adopted as the zero orthometric height of taiwan the orthometric height is the height above sea level for practical purposes we picked up the four endemic fishes acrossocheilus paradoxus rhinogobius candidianus opsariichthys pachycephalus and formosania lacustre as the indicator species that were discovered in the dahan river to represent different habitat preferences shih 2017 a paradoxus and o pachycephalus swimat the freshwatersurface while r candidianus and f lacustre are typical demersal fishes shen 1993 indicated that the whole year is the spawning period of r candidianus and that of the other three fishes is between march and december every year the spawning habitat of the four fish species is typical with slow motion riverine areas and the riverbed substrate of cobbles and sands 2 2 flow regime analysis 2 2 1 flow exceedance probability the daily flow data from 1970 to 1995 was utilized to make the probability density map of each year the discrete data was adopted to draw a histogram while a suitable probability density function was derived from fitting the discrete data the concepts of exceedance probability ep and time series were then introduced to determine the probability of occurrence greater than specific daily flow the weibull method was employed to analyze the ep level based on equation 1 1 e p p q q m m n 1 100 where ep is the probability that a given daily flow will be met or exceeded time m denotes the recorded data of m in descending order and n represents the total number of flow data 2 2 2 formulation of wavelet method the wa time series expression can be shown in equation 2 torrence and compo 1998 2 w n s n 0 n 1 x n ψ n n δ t s where n is the total time length of flow data δt is the time step length of sample data ψ is the complex conjugate of ψ s is the wavelet scale and n is the localized time index by varying the wavelet scale and translating along with the localized time index one can construct a picture showing both the amplitude of any features versus the scale and how this amplitude varies with time let η n n δt s then ψ η δt s 1 2 ψ0 η and ψ0 η is the normalized wavelet function farge 1992 as shown in equation 3 3 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e η 2 2 where ω0 6 in this study according to the suggestion of farge 1992 the amplitude of wn s in equation 2 is wn s which can quantify the wavelet energy value after continuous wavelet transform in addition the energy distribution in periodic mode is defined as a continuous time series wps which can be expressed as a function of amplitude as shown in equation 4 the definition of the time scale sj of wavelet transformation is shown in equation 5 while the subscript j expression of sj is shown in equation 6 4 wp s n s w n s 2 f o r s s 0 s 1 s j 5 s j s 0 2 j δ j for j 0 1 j 6 j δ j 1 log 2 n δ t s 0 where s0 2δt represents the minimum period in transformation the time averaged wps of equation 4 calculates the globally scale averaged wavelet power spectrum gwps as shown in equation 7 since the average value of different time lengths can identify the changing trend of varying time scales as suggested by zolezzi et al 2009 equation 8 was employed in this study to examine the degree of difference in gwps before and after the weir operation 7 gwps s 1 n n 0 n 1 w p s n s 1 n n 0 n 1 w n s 2 f o r s s 0 s 1 s j 8 ρ s g w p s 1 s g w p s 2 s f o r s s 0 s 1 s j where gwps1 and gwps2 represent the gwps values of yuanshan weir 13 years before and 13 years after the operation respectively ρ s greater than one means that the global wavelet energy of gwps1 is more extensive than that of gwps2 on a specific time scale indicating the daily flow oscillation of gwps1 is higher than that of gwps2 otherwise 0 ρ s 1 suggests that the flow oscillation of gwps1 is lower than that of gwps2 this study additionally applies deviation between wavelet power spectra dwps and globally averaged deviation between wavelet power spectra gdwps to evaluate the spectral differences between gwps1 and gwps2 for the two sets of flow sequences before and after the weir construction wu et al 2015 as shown in equations 9 and 10 9 dwp s n s log 2 wps 1 n s wps 2 n s f o r s s 0 s 1 s j 10 gdwps s 1 n n 0 n 1 log 2 wps 1 n s wps 2 n s

of reclamation srh 2d solves the 2d dynamic wave equations i e the depth averaged st venant equations lai 2009 we inquired about the topographic survey results of the dahan river over the years and found that the topographic changes between 1970 and 1995 were insignificant the main reason is that the topography of the dahan river downstream of the shihmen reservoir has been eroded significantly since the operation year 1964 of the reservoir located upstream of yuanshan weir on the contrary the river channel has gradually approached a dynamic equilibrium during our study years therefore this study neglected the topographic changes downstream before and after constructing and operating the weir the governing equations of srh 2d for hydrodynamic computation contain continuity equation and momentum equation as shown in equations 11 to 13 srh 2d uses a flexible mesh that may contain arbitrarily shaped cells in practice the hybrid mesh of quadrilateral and triangular cells is recommended though purely quadrilateral or triangular elements may be exploited besides srh 2d adopts a zonal approach for coupled modeling of main and side channels and floodplains a river system is divided into modeling zones and each zone may be assigned different parameters such as manning s roughness coefficient the grid size of the river main channel and the floodplain in the research area was 10 m 10 m and the time step was 0 5 s manning s n values in the simulation were initially estimated per the suggestion by cowan 1956 and the field conditions ranging from 0 030 to 0 055 they were confirmed

and water area wet grid based on the results of hydrodynamic calculations the flow velocity and water depth values at each grid were obtained from the hydrodynamic model simulation the dry grids with zero flow velocity or water depth were set as drylands and water areas can be subdivided into variant habitat units mus according to the suggestion of wyrick and pasternack 2012 the mu classification method includes four categories pool glide run and riffle the habitat suitability index hsi was calculated based on habitat characteristics and the impact of the habitat on indicator species u s fish and wildlife service 1981 the analysis of the species environment relationship has always been a central issue in ecology guisan and zimmerman 2000 the widely used preference function method for habitat modeling requires quantitative descriptions of the organism s environmental habitat characteristics and quality of life based on the hsi entwistle et al 2019 the hsi score ranges from 0 for the least suitable habitat to 1 for the optimum habitat to quantify the fish habitat quality as shown in equation 14 the hsi was classified with five levels in this study according to elkins et al 2007 non habitat hsi 0 hq1 poor habitat 0 hsi 0 1 hq2 low quality habitat 0 1 hsi 0 4 hq3 medium quality habitat 0 4 hsi 0 7 hq4 and high quality habitat 0 7 hsi 1 0 hq5 the hydraulic characteristics simulation obtained the critical habitat characteristics for estimating habitat suitability flow velocity and water depth the habitat suitability curves of the four fish species developed by the wra moea 2010 were referenced to determine the weighted usable area wua and percentage of usable area pua as shown in equations 15 and 16 the larger the wua and pua values the more suitable the target species is 14 hsi i s vi s di 15 wua i hsi i a i 16 pua wua i a i where ai is the mesh area of the study area and hsii is the combined suitability factor for ai including flow velocity svi and water depth sdi the suitability values of svi and sdi were determined by incorporating the simulated flow velocity and water depth through the hydrodynamic model into the preference curve of each endemic fish species wra moea 2010 3 results 3 1 alteration of flow regimes the time series analyses of daily flow changes revealed substantial differences related to the weir construction as shown in fig 3 the results show that the post construction time series has an increased frequency of extra large flows especially in the first few years after construction fig 3a the annual average daily flow in the wet season was ranging from 11 5 m3s 1 to 76 5 m3s 1 mean 45 2 m3s 1 and from 8 3 m3s 1 to 85 3 m3s 1 mean 40 5 m3s 1 respectively before and after the weir construction the annual average daily flow in the dry season ranged from 5 7 m3s 1 to 35 2 m3s 1 mean 16 1 m3s 1 and from 0 9 m3s 1 to 62 5 m3s 1 mean 12 4 m3s 1 respectively before and after the weir construction the annual deviation of daily flow significantly raised 86 and 290 in wet and dry seasons respectively after the weir construction whereas the annual average daily flow revealed no significant difference representing the flow rates decline in the dry season and increase in the wet season the characteristics of these extra large flows were very distinct from those before the construction of the weir and the period was shortened to one to two years the research results also found more minimal flows in the dry season after the construction of the weir as shown in fig 3b the annual average flow rate decreased from 30 8 m3s 1 bwc to 26 7 m3s 1 awc while the average flow rates in the wet season and dry season decreased from 45 2 m3s 1 bwc to 40 8 m3s 1 awc and decreased from 16 1 m3s 1 bwc to 12 4 m3s 1 awc the annual maximum and minimum flow rates increased from 758 7 m3s 1 bwc to 1067 5 m3s 1 awc suggesting the increase of the larger flow rate in the wet season the annual minimum flow rate decreased from 2 1 m3s 1 bwc to 0 1 m3s 1 awc indicating the decrease in the smaller flow rate in the dry season besides the standard deviation of the annual average flow rate increased from 62 0 m3s 1 bwc to 94 3 m3s 1 awc whereas the standard deviation of flow rates in the wet season and dry season increased from 80 1 m3s 1 bwc to 120 5 m3s 1 awc and increased from 15 8 m3s 1 bwc to 29 2 m3s 1 awc this result indicates that after the weir construction the large flow events downstream during the flood period occurred more frequently and the flow amount became more extensive than those before the weir construction in contrast the occurrence of small flow increased and the flow quantity decreased in the dry season which may raise the environmental stress on the downstream aquatic ecosystem besides the operation of the weir predominantly involved small to moderate sized e flows in which the proportion of small flows enlargements in contrast the moderate sized flows disappear or decrease by comparing with the probability density distributions as shown in fig 3c furthermore the e flows of q95 q90 q75 and q50 were calculated for the two periods before 1970 1982 and after 1983 1995 the construction of the weir after the construction of the weir the 13 year average daily flow in the dry season was severely diminished thus being lower than the smaller e flows q95 and q90 as shown in fig 4 a and 4b the q95 q90 q75 and q50 dropped from 7 2 m3s 1 to 0 4 m3s 1 10 1 m3s 1 to 0 6 m3s 1 16 3 m3s 1 to 0 8 m3s 1 and 25 8 m3s 1 to 4 2 m3s 1 respectively after the weir operation in contrast the flow regime below the larger e flows q75 and q50 occurred only in the dry season before the weir construction as shown in fig 4c and 4d the results also revealed that the extremely high flow events rose significantly during the wet season after the weir construction we concluded that 1 the daily flows downstream were higher in the wet season and lower in the dry season after the in stream weir operation 2 the smaller environmental flows were significantly affected during the dry season whereas the larger environmental flows were impacted in all seasons the wavelet spectrum results for the daily flow change after wavelet transformation were discovered that the energy value increases with the increase of the time scale besides the regular gradient color alternately reflects the seasonal dynamics of the flow regimes as shown in fig 5 a and 5b this result exhibited that after the construction of yuanshan weir in 1983 the change of the 2 days scale flow amplitude was getting enlarged and the oscillation was relatively forceful which may be related to the periodic and regular water intake from the banxin water plant the gwps ratios between the 2 days scale and the annual scale were greater than 1 indicating that the degree of flow variation at this time scale is significantly different due to the construction of the weir as shown in fig 5c the gwps ratios peaked at six on the time scales from 2 days to 1 week and then decreased with increasing time scales until approaching one on annual scales similarly gdwps peaked between 2 days and 1 week scales and then gradually declined as the scale grew until the annual scale reached a minimum value as shown in fig 5d the findings suggest that the operation of the yuanshan weir has the most significant impact on the flow of the 2 days to 1 week scale but has little effect on the annual scale 3 2 changes in habitat structure according to the analysis of the flow characteristics before and after weir construction four kinds of e flow q95 q90 q75 and q50 before and after the weir operation performed as the upstream flow boundary conditions in srh 2d before conducting the hydrodynamic simulation of these scenarios this study carried out the verification of srh 2d for model verification we collected water levels from the gauge station within the study area from august 1 to august 15 in 2015 the water levels during this period contained normal tidal levels and flood levels during typhoon soudelor the numerical meshes and grids of the river channel are displayed in fig 1b and the verification result of the water levels is illustrated in fig 1c the results demonstrated quite matched to the measurement with the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of approximately 0 95 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 indicating the reliability of the srh 2d model simulations the habitat model calculation coupling with the hydrodynamic simulation results showed that the total water area declines under each flow rate which exhibits the overall impact on the habitat after the weir construction as shown in table 1 q75 has the most significant reduction from the water intake operation of the weir the dryland coverage within the study area accounted for more than 80 in comparison the proportion of the four habitat areas was 20 in all e flow scenarios glide was the primary aquatic habitat type which contributed the most to high quality habitat greater than12 followed by riffle 1 91 3 83 and pool 1 96 2 98 while run had the lowest contribution to habitat quality 1 except for glide other habitats were diminished due to the construction of the weir as shown in fig 6 a note that the pua value of glide and the corresponding habitat growth achieved the most significance under the q90 flow case run was the most degraded pursued by riffle and pool besides the proportion of almost all habitats declined with the decrease of e flow with run falling the most riffle second and pool the third whereas glide varied less obviously 3 3 fish habitat dynamics r candidianus and a paradoxus had the highest pua values ranging from 1 27 to 2 09 and 1 40 1 54 respectively the pua of f lacustre was followed 0 51 0 88 and o pachycephalus was the lowest 0 13 0 20 as shown in table 1 under higher e flow conditions q50 and q75 the pua of r candidianus was higher than that of a paradoxus conversely when the e flow was at lower stage q90 and q95 the pua of r candidianus was smaller than that of a paradoxus furthermore the pua values of all fish in all e flow scenarios decreased after the construction of the weir as shown in fig 6b the pua dropped in the q50 case was the highest and the pua diminished in the q75 q90 and q95 was roughly comparable the fish habitat area was conjoined with the classification by habitat quality to understand the variant habitat quality ratio of these four endemic fishes as shown in fig 7 before constructing the weir the medium and high quality habitat areas of r candidianus and a paradoxus were the highest among all fish species indicating that the study area was the most suitable for these two species of fish fig 7a the habitat area of r candidianus was ranked from high to low under various e flow conditions hq4 medium quality habitat highest hq3 low quality habitat and hq5 high quality habitat second and third hq1 non habitat followed and hq2 poor habitat had the lowest proportion with the enlargement in e flow the area occupied by each habitat quality increased except for the hq4 in contrast the habitat area of a paradoxus was ranked from high to low by following the order hq5 highest hq4 and hq3 second and third hq1 followed and hq2 had the lowest proportion besides a paradoxus has a more extensive high quality habitat area suggesting that it may have a more survival advantage than r candidianus as for the other two fishes the habitat suitability of o pachycephalus was slightly higher than that of f lacustre nevertheless the area of the high quality habitat of these two species was relatively low the suitable habitat area of each e flow after the weir construction was similar to before the weir construction as shown in fig 7b of the four endemic fish species f lacustresuffered the most damaging consequence from the weir operation on suitable habitats including low medium and high quality habitats the differences in habitat quality before and after weir construction showed a degraded direction as shown in fig 7c in the case of q75 the proportion of habitat with medium and high quality habitats declined the most and q90 ranked the second indicating that the water intake from the weir most significantly influences the two e flows in addition the non habitat area hq1 increased after the construction of the weir occurred in the cases of two smaller e flows q90 and q95 the results may indicate that the water area lowered and the habitat unsuitable for fish raised we concluded that although the weir construction has different degrees of negative impact on the various e flow and fish species it generally diminishes the proportion of suitable habitats which may strengthen the environmental stress of aquatic organisms moreover the fish habitat area habitat type and habitat quality classification were further incorporated and analyzed as shown in fig 8 except for the glide habilitated by r candidianus at q95 q75 and q50 the habitat quality of the other habitat types at all e flows was reduced as shown in fig 8a among all the habitats used by r candidianus only the habitat quality of glide was not significantly impacted by the weir we also found that the riffle used by r candidianus had the most prominent degradation in habitat quality the habitat quality degradation of a paradoxus was similar to that of r candidianus as shown in fig 8b however unlike r candidianus habitat quality variation a paradoxus had the highest reduction in the proportion of high quality habitat hq5 in pool habitat this finding may imply that a paradoxus prefers the pool habitat which was most affected by the weir indicated in fig 6 as well the riffle of o pachycephalus had the highest reduction in the proportion of suitable habitat as shown in fig 8c the proportion of suitable habitat for riffle increased slightly in the case of low e flow q95 changes in the run habitat ratio of o pachycephalus demonstrated a general degradation of habitat quality due to the weir in the pool habitat except for the high e flow q50 found the raised proportion of high quality habitat the habitat quality of the other habitat types was degraded unlike other habitat types o pachycephalus had a slightly increasing proportion of suitable habitat in the glide habitat after the weir operation the sum of the proportions of suitable habitats hq3 hq4 hq5 for all habitat types of f lacustre showed a decreasing trend as shown in fig 8d this result may reflect the significant degradation of the overall habitat quality of f lacustre caused by the weir this finding is consistent with the results of figs 6 and 7 described above we also found that under the e flow condition of q75 the run habitat suffered the most negative impact which should be paid special attention to in future habitat restoration 4 discussion the freshwater flow regime is the key factor shaping the ecosystem process poff and zimmerman 2010 determining the e flow is critically important to sustain river ecosystems but is always challenging arthington et al 2006 akter and ali 2012 according to the statistics of daily flow data downstream of yuanshan weir in this study the water intake of the weir caused significant changes in the flow characteristics such as the frequency and amplitude of the flow regimes figs 3 and 4 from the analysis of the difference of wavelet energy spectrum this study discovered that after the construction of the weir the wavelet has a relatively regular flow amplitude transformation on the 2 days scale the amplitude difference between the 2 days and 1 week scales is noticeable the oscillation was intense which regarding the banxin water plant was related to the periodic and regular short term and long term water intake operations the amplitude of low frequency with high power frequently appears at different scales after the construction of the weir which was presumed to be related to the artificial regulation of forced flood discharge during the wet season after the construction of the yuanshan weir the variation period of dry season was shortened to about one year indicating that the changes in the flow of the rivers tended to be frequent and rapid and the average annual flow showed a downward trend as a whole the results showed that the operation of yuanshan weir increased the variability of the flow regime of the downstream channel and induced the flow regime of the river to be relatively unstable the gwps ratios of the 13 years before and after are all greater than one reflecting that the overall flow oscillation after the construction of the weir was relatively severe at whole time scales both of the peaks of gwps ratio and gdwps occurred between the 2 days and 1 week scales revealing that the flow from these scales was most affected by the water intake from the weir fig 5 e flows could contribute meaningfully and desired conservation effects on the aquatic community composition of fishes and macroinvertebrates depending on the magnitude of the flow and on the specific habitat type pander et al 2019 we found that the 2 days to 1 week time scale flow discharges are approximately equal to q95 to q50 denoting the demand of e flows of the dahan river besides in the range from 2 days to 1 week from 1970 to 1982 before the weir construction the spectral color band remained in the blue part with yellow green stripes interspersed intermittently in addition to the phenomenon mentioned above the spectral characteristics from 1983 to 1995 after the weir construction also appeared pink stripes interspersed with blue bands this phenomenon shows that the downstream flow of the yuanshan weir has been significantly influenced after the construction affiliated to the flood discharge from the weir during the wet season habitat models that consider the relationship between hydrological factors and habitat conditions have been widely used to quantify seasonal habitat variations nukazawa et al 2011 evaluate habitat quality mocq et al 2013 and determine environmental flow akter and tanim 2018 stamou et al 2018 hydrodynamic simulation and habitat type calculation were carried out in this study for eight scenarios including q95 to q50 before and after the weir construction obtained from the time series exceedance probability after constructing this weir the downstream water area due to the use of river water resources is significantly reduced and the proportion of the total water area reduction is the largest under the q75 situation table 1 this finding may reveal that the river system is not healthy enough with the low water area the environmental stress of the aquatic ecosystem would be dramatically increased once the e flow was lowered the present study found that those glide habitats were more suitable for slow creatures after construction increased fig 6 however a significant increase in the percentage of a single habitat would reduce the coverage of other habitats thereby lowering habitat diversity glide may be beneficial for specific organisms but the enlargement of its coverage area may be harmful to river systems moreover the habitat run was most degraded in all flow scenarios while the other habitat type that was significantly negatively impacted was the riffle the most apparent change was discovered among the eight flow conditions at q75 thus the impact of this level of e flow demands on habitat conservation deserves attention we suggest that the weir management authorities formulate a set of continuous flow releases instead of pulsed discharges during the dry season so as to maintain a relatively stable e flow random release mode is recommended if pulsed is used which may help slow down the fluctuation of downstream flow and reduce the environmental stress of aquatic organisms van niekerk et al 2012 chilton et al 2021 ecological variables across multiple spatial scales are critical when creating refuges and maintaining landscape level processes labbe and fausch 2000 newson and newson 2000 found the primary concern of river management should be the relationship between the habitat pattern and the biological responses for example carnie et al 2016 linked the observed spawning location for chinook salmon with the predicted spatial distribution of habitat patches their results confirmed that the size of habitat patches was one of the most critical factors in defining the condition of a river environment hitchman et al 2018 quantified species habitat relationships within mesohabitats to identify the keystone habitats that influence fish species richness besides the quantified prediction of the river responses to specific disorders leading to the disconnection in the river is necessary for river management yi et al 2010 wohl 2017 kuo et al 2021 suggested creating refuge and feeding habitats through channel morphology modification to benefit endemic fishes during the dry season pander et al 2021 regarded the restoration plan of fluctuating water levels and discharges as mitigating the influenced timing and amplitude of environmental flows for alpine rivers the present study found similar results and conclude that supplying a random flow discharge to satisfy a natural flow regime in the dry season is critically important hydrological connectivity can be generated by freshwater flow from catchment to ocean longitudinally and laterally from exchanges with intertidal and littoral habitats and estuary duggan et al 2019 chilton et al 2021 freshwater flows often shape the habitat requirements for migrating organisms such as endemic fish schrandt et al 2015 pander et al 2022 found that egg and larva mortalities of salmonid spawning habitats were significantly higher in the hydropeaking affected site than in non affected sites regarding the proportion of habitat types the present study found that the habitats became monotonic after the construction of the weir and the reduction of the water area resulted in the overall decline of the habitat quality dynamic management for flow regimes that comprise environmental flows and flood extremes could sustain high conservation value in freshwater biodiversity pander et al 2019 knott et al 2021 found that anthropogenic alterations such as the weir construction led to a loss of habitat quantity quality and connectivity for riverine fish species they also concluded that the resulting reduction of freshwater fishes had prompted the improvement of spawning habitat quality for addressing bottlenecks in fish life cycles because the suitable water environment of these endemic fishes with different habitat conditions is different in different life cycle we suggest local construction for the degraded vital habitats especially in the dry season the habitat type with the most considerable reduction in area ratio was run and riffle so it is recommended to put more effort into the habitat creation in addition if there is enough hinterland for off channel water storage to replace the current in river weir the negative impacts on natural flow regimes and fish habitat quality would be mitigated significantly this study indicated the importance of modifying weir operation to provide near natural flow regimes and restoring the degraded habitats for essential fish habitat conservation 5 conclusion this study develops a comprehensive methodology including the wavelet analysis model exceedance probability approach hydrodynamic and habitat models to quantify environmental flow demand and structural habitat of endemic fishes with and without in river structures we found that the weir evidently altered river hydrology and aquatic ecosystem including flow regime habitat structure and fish habitat quality the flow difference between dry and wet seasons became more extensive indicating the alternative flow regime downstream the deviation of daily flow significantly raised after the weir construction indicating the flow rates decline in the dry season and enlarge in the wet season the habitat types run and riffle were most degraded and the endemic fish species f lacustre suffered the most damaging consequences on suitable habitat quality and quantity induced by the weir water intake we accordingly propose alternative mitigations such as random discharge schemes and rehabilitation programs based on the critical findings of the present study declaration of competing interest the

2672,in river hydraulic structures may negatively impact aquatic ecosystems including changing river flow regimes and the habitat quality of endemic fish habitats this study integrates the wavelet analysis and the time series exceedance probability method to quantify the degree of evolution in the river flow regime caused by weirs and determine the critical time scale most affected in the environmental flow hydrodynamic and habitat models were conducted to analyze the influence of the variant flow characteristics between the dry and wet seasons on the habitat structure four endemic fishes were selected as the indicator species to represent different habitat preferences and reveal the spatiotemporal changes in habitat quality the flow difference between dry and wet seasons became more extensive after the weir construction indicating the alternative flow regime downstream the annual deviation of daily flow dramatically raised showing the flow rates decline in the dry season and enlarge in the wet season the findings exhibit that the downstream flow amplitude changes regardless of time scale after constructing the weir the flow data from the 2 days scale to the 1 week scale were most adjusted meaning that these periods to meet the environmental flow decline significantly the critical environmental flow corresponding to lower flow events was apparently influenced in the dry season in which the q75 and q90 displayed the highest degradation in fish habitat quality in addition the simulation results of the habitat model found that glide is the primary habitat type the total water area and the habitat diversity were reduced while the habitat quality also had a lowered tendency after the weir operation the habitat run was most degraded and the riffle was also significantly negatively impacted regarding the endemic fish species f lacustresuffered the most harmful effects on suitable habitat quality and quantity from the weir this study suggests considering natural flow regimes at the planning and design phases of weir construction and rehabilitating these essential habitat patterns to mitigate the downstream ecosystem impacts keywords hydrological

supporting human society and healthy ecosystems can directly or indirectly enhance human well being and maintain social functioning müller and burkhard 2012 costanza et al 1997 water resources are fundamental driving forces for sustaining a healthy aquatic ecosystem requiring integrative concepts for their conservation geist 2011 to effectively solve the problem of providing water for human consumption in river structures such as weirs have functions that contribute to human development such as power generation flood control and recreation unfortunately freshwater resources are scarce and the rapid growth of cities has increased the per capita water demand which may generate water conflicts postel et al 1996 alcamo et al 2003 global climate change may bring more consequences on the river flow regime leading to escalating demands for hydraulic engineering and increasing environmental stress on aquatic ecosystems mccarthy et al 2001 malmqvist and rundle 2002 climate change related changes can be further exacerbated by dam and weir construction in light of the worldwide expansion of hydropower where changes in downstream flow regimes and upstream hydropeaking need to become better integrated into management decisions geist 2021 pander et al 2022 to meet the increasing demand for human water resources measuring and making reasonable choices for supporting healthy aquatic ecosystems is a problem that must be prudent in the world today several studies have found that changes in natural flow regimes caused by in river hydraulic structures such as reservoirs and weirs worsen river corridor and threaten ecosystem biodiversity ligon et al 1995 poff et al 1997 batalla et al 2004 magilligan and nislow 2005 graf 2006 singer 2007 petts 2009 botter et al 2010 fitzhugh and vogel 2011 kuo et al 2021 barriers of weirs often cause changes in river morphology and biogeochemical characteristics of floodplains and block river continuity resulting in a significant reduction or extinction of migratory fish populations and other related organisms petts 2009 yeager 1994 yi et al 2010 besides the alteration in flow regimes caused by weirs may further induce discontinuities in physical conditions such as water depth flow velocity sediment transport and nutrient delivery triggering a series of adverse ecological impacts im et al 2011 in addition to the direct effects on physicochemical habitat quality fish and macroinvertebrate communities there are also more subtle effects of weirs on primary production and the biodiversity of stream ecosystems mueller et al 2011 the significant effect of these in river structures on the river flow regime is essential however the extent of influence of spatiotemporal flow regime variations on the system and quality of river habitats is still lacking how to mitigate the impact of flow regulation has been an important topic discussed by researchers for many years jowett 1997 the temporal and spatial scales regarding harmful river corridors and aquatic ecosystems are critical of academic and engineering concerns kuo et al 2021 poff et al 1997 suggested that a natural flow regime not affected by human beings can be composed of hydrological indicators with five parameters such as magnitude frequency duration and time rate of change wavelet analysis wa provides a powerful tool for the simultaneous detection of hydrological alteration on multiple time scales and has been increasingly utilized in recent years nakken 1999 white et al 2005 steel and lange 2007 wa reflects local fluctuations inherent in non stationary processes and effectively zooms in or out on detailed changes at specific time scales zolezzi et al 2009 shiau and huang 2014 since wa does not need to pre set the width of the time frame and can display time frequency information simultaneously it can effectively analyze unsteady signals white et al 2005 therefore compared with the traditional fourier transform wa offers more effective interpretation capability in multiple time series analysis kumar and foufoula georgiou 1993 saco and kumar 2000 gaucherel 2002 coulibaly and burn 2004 veneziano et al 2006 venugopal et al 2006 wa furnishes several opportunities to study local aperiodic and multiscale detailed processes mallat and zhang 1993 kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 by allowing the width of the wavelet to increase with the period of wider fourier transform for more efficient and precise localization of dominant modes kaiser 1994 lau and weng 1995 for example wu et al 2015 employed wavelet power spectrum wps to detect hydrological changes at multiple scales they developed an index of globally averaged deviation between wavelet power spectra based on the wps concept to analyze the dynamic flow regime of the feicui reservoir in taiwan the primary purposes of this study are 1 using the exceedance probability method and wavelet analysis method to figure out the time scale of the significant alteration in the flow regime caused by the in river weir and the corresponding variation of environmental flows e flows 2 integrating the hydrodynamic model and the habitat model to analyze the effects on the river habitat structure and fish habitat quality caused by the adjustment of flow regime and e flow we also discuss issues in river management that the hydrological alteration and structural habitat dynamics imply and inspire accordingly 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area is about 20 km between yuanshan weir and xinhai bridge in the middle reaches of the dahan river in northern taiwan as shown in fig 1 a the dahan river is one of the principal tributaries of the tanshuei river basin with a total length of 135 km and a drainage area of 1 163 square kilometers the slope of the river bed ranges from 0 1 to 0 6 the primary function of yuanshan weir is to store the discharge water from the shimen reservoir and send it to banxin water supply plant for treatment and utilization it is one of the primary water sources provided in metropolitan taipei as far as northern taiwan is concerned in the present study the low rainfall period from november to april of the following year is defined as the dry season while the rainy period from may to october is the wet season lee et al 2019 this study collects the daily flow data from january 1 1970 to december 31 1995 at sanying bridge station downstream of the weir wra moea 2014 twenty six years of daily flow data collected were divided into two time intervals the construction of the yuanshan weir in 1983 was used to separate into 13 years before bwc and 13 years after awc to compare the flow pattern dynamics of the downstream channels as shown in fig 2 the elevation of the adjacent cross section in 2017 developed by the tenth river management office water resources agency ministry of economic affairs taiwan was used as the benchmark reference the benchmark elevation and water level records were obtained from the taiwanese fundamental benchmark of keelung this absolute benchmark was determined by the mean sea level and has been adopted as the zero orthometric height of taiwan the orthometric height is the height above sea level for practical purposes we picked up the four endemic fishes acrossocheilus paradoxus rhinogobius candidianus opsariichthys pachycephalus and formosania lacustre as the indicator species that were discovered in the dahan river to represent different habitat preferences shih 2017 a paradoxus and o pachycephalus swimat the freshwatersurface while r candidianus and f lacustre are typical demersal fishes shen 1993 indicated that the whole year is the spawning period of r candidianus and that of the other three fishes is between march and december every year the spawning habitat of the four fish species is typical with slow motion riverine areas and the riverbed substrate of cobbles and sands 2 2 flow regime analysis 2 2 1 flow exceedance probability the daily flow data from 1970 to 1995 was utilized to make the probability density map of each year the discrete data was adopted to draw a histogram while a suitable probability density function was derived from fitting the discrete data the concepts of exceedance probability ep and time series were then introduced to determine the probability of occurrence greater than specific daily flow the weibull method was employed to analyze the ep level based on equation 1 1 e p p q q m m n 1 100 where ep is the probability that a given daily flow will be met or exceeded time m denotes the recorded data of m in descending order and n represents the total number of flow data 2 2 2 formulation of wavelet method the wa time series expression can be shown in equation 2 torrence and compo 1998 2 w n s n 0 n 1 x n ψ n n δ t s where n is the total time length of flow data δt is the time step length of sample data ψ is the complex conjugate of ψ s is the wavelet scale and n is the localized time index by varying the wavelet scale and translating along with the localized time index one can construct a picture showing both the amplitude of any features versus the scale and how this amplitude varies with time let η n n δt s then ψ η δt s 1 2 ψ0 η and ψ0 η is the normalized wavelet function farge 1992 as shown in equation 3 3 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e η 2 2 where ω0 6 in this study according to the suggestion of farge 1992 the amplitude of wn s in equation 2 is wn s which can quantify the wavelet energy value after continuous wavelet transform in addition the energy distribution in periodic mode is defined as a continuous time series wps which can be expressed as a function of amplitude as shown in equation 4 the definition of the time scale sj of wavelet transformation is shown in equation 5 while the subscript j expression of sj is shown in equation 6 4 wp s n s w n s 2 f o r s s 0 s 1 s j 5 s j s 0 2 j δ j for j 0 1 j 6 j δ j 1 log 2 n δ t s 0 where s0 2δt represents the minimum period in transformation the time averaged wps of equation 4 calculates the globally scale averaged wavelet power spectrum gwps as shown in equation 7 since the average value of different time lengths can identify the changing trend of varying time scales as suggested by zolezzi et al 2009 equation 8 was employed in this study to examine the degree of difference in gwps before and after the weir operation 7 gwps s 1 n n 0 n 1 w p s n s 1 n n 0 n 1 w n s 2 f o r s s 0 s 1 s j 8 ρ s g w p s 1 s g w p s 2 s f o r s s 0 s 1 s j where gwps1 and gwps2 represent the gwps values of yuanshan weir 13 years before and 13 years after the operation respectively ρ s greater than one means that the global wavelet energy of gwps1 is more extensive than that of gwps2 on a specific time scale indicating the daily flow oscillation of gwps1 is higher than that of gwps2 otherwise 0 ρ s 1 suggests that the flow oscillation of gwps1 is lower than that of gwps2 this study additionally applies deviation between wavelet power spectra dwps and globally averaged deviation between wavelet power spectra gdwps to evaluate the spectral differences between gwps1 and gwps2 for the two sets of flow sequences before and after the weir construction wu et al 2015 as shown in equations 9 and 10 9 dwp s n s log 2 wps 1 n s wps 2 n s f o r s s 0 s 1 s j 10 gdwps s 1 n n 0 n 1 log 2 wps 1 n s wps 2 n s

of reclamation srh 2d solves the 2d dynamic wave equations i e the depth averaged st venant equations lai 2009 we inquired about the topographic survey results of the dahan river over the years and found that the topographic changes between 1970 and 1995 were insignificant the main reason is that the topography of the dahan river downstream of the shihmen reservoir has been eroded significantly since the operation year 1964 of the reservoir located upstream of yuanshan weir on the contrary the river channel has gradually approached a dynamic equilibrium during our study years therefore this study neglected the topographic changes downstream before and after constructing and operating the weir the governing equations of srh 2d for hydrodynamic computation contain continuity equation and momentum equation as shown in equations 11 to 13 srh 2d uses a flexible mesh that may contain arbitrarily shaped cells in practice the hybrid mesh of quadrilateral and triangular cells is recommended though purely quadrilateral or triangular elements may be exploited besides srh 2d adopts a zonal approach for coupled modeling of main and side channels and floodplains a river system is divided into modeling zones and each zone may be assigned different parameters such as manning s roughness coefficient the grid size of the river main channel and the floodplain in the research area was 10 m 10 m and the time step was 0 5 s manning s n values in the simulation were initially estimated per the suggestion by cowan 1956 and the field conditions ranging from 0 030 to 0 055 they were confirmed

and water area wet grid based on the results of hydrodynamic calculations the flow velocity and water depth values at each grid were obtained from the hydrodynamic model simulation the dry grids with zero flow velocity or water depth were set as drylands and water areas can be subdivided into variant habitat units mus according to the suggestion of wyrick and pasternack 2012 the mu classification method includes four categories pool glide run and riffle the habitat suitability index hsi was calculated based on habitat characteristics and the impact of the habitat on indicator species u s fish and wildlife service 1981 the analysis of the species environment relationship has always been a central issue in ecology guisan and zimmerman 2000 the widely used preference function method for habitat modeling requires quantitative descriptions of the organism s environmental habitat characteristics and quality of life based on the hsi entwistle et al 2019 the hsi score ranges from 0 for the least suitable habitat to 1 for the optimum habitat to quantify the fish habitat quality as shown in equation 14 the hsi was classified with five levels in this study according to elkins et al 2007 non habitat hsi 0 hq1 poor habitat 0 hsi 0 1 hq2 low quality habitat 0 1 hsi 0 4 hq3 medium quality habitat 0 4 hsi 0 7 hq4 and high quality habitat 0 7 hsi 1 0 hq5 the hydraulic characteristics simulation obtained the critical habitat characteristics for estimating habitat suitability flow velocity and water depth the habitat suitability curves of the four fish species developed by the wra moea 2010 were referenced to determine the weighted usable area wua and percentage of usable area pua as shown in equations 15 and 16 the larger the wua and pua values the more suitable the target species is 14 hsi i s vi s di 15 wua i hsi i a i 16 pua wua i a i where ai is the mesh area of the study area and hsii is the combined suitability factor for ai including flow velocity svi and water depth sdi the suitability values of svi and sdi were determined by incorporating the simulated flow velocity and water depth through the hydrodynamic model into the preference curve of each endemic fish species wra moea 2010 3 results 3 1 alteration of flow regimes the time series analyses of daily flow changes revealed substantial differences related to the weir construction as shown in fig 3 the results show that the post construction time series has an increased frequency of extra large flows especially in the first few years after construction fig 3a the annual average daily flow in the wet season was ranging from 11 5 m3s 1 to 76 5 m3s 1 mean 45 2 m3s 1 and from 8 3 m3s 1 to 85 3 m3s 1 mean 40 5 m3s 1 respectively before and after the weir construction the annual average daily flow in the dry season ranged from 5 7 m3s 1 to 35 2 m3s 1 mean 16 1 m3s 1 and from 0 9 m3s 1 to 62 5 m3s 1 mean 12 4 m3s 1 respectively before and after the weir construction the annual deviation of daily flow significantly raised 86 and 290 in wet and dry seasons respectively after the weir construction whereas the annual average daily flow revealed no significant difference representing the flow rates decline in the dry season and increase in the wet season the characteristics of these extra large flows were very distinct from those before the construction of the weir and the period was shortened to one to two years the research results also found more minimal flows in the dry season after the construction of the weir as shown in fig 3b the annual average flow rate decreased from 30 8 m3s 1 bwc to 26 7 m3s 1 awc while the average flow rates in the wet season and dry season decreased from 45 2 m3s 1 bwc to 40 8 m3s 1 awc and decreased from 16 1 m3s 1 bwc to 12 4 m3s 1 awc the annual maximum and minimum flow rates increased from 758 7 m3s 1 bwc to 1067 5 m3s 1 awc suggesting the increase of the larger flow rate in the wet season the annual minimum flow rate decreased from 2 1 m3s 1 bwc to 0 1 m3s 1 awc indicating the decrease in the smaller flow rate in the dry season besides the standard deviation of the annual average flow rate increased from 62 0 m3s 1 bwc to 94 3 m3s 1 awc whereas the standard deviation of flow rates in the wet season and dry season increased from 80 1 m3s 1 bwc to 120 5 m3s 1 awc and increased from 15 8 m3s 1 bwc to 29 2 m3s 1 awc this result indicates that after the weir construction the large flow events downstream during the flood period occurred more frequently and the flow amount became more extensive than those before the weir construction in contrast the occurrence of small flow increased and the flow quantity decreased in the dry season which may raise the environmental stress on the downstream aquatic ecosystem besides the operation of the weir predominantly involved small to moderate sized e flows in which the proportion of small flows enlargements in contrast the moderate sized flows disappear or decrease by comparing with the probability density distributions as shown in fig 3c furthermore the e flows of q95 q90 q75 and q50 were calculated for the two periods before 1970 1982 and after 1983 1995 the construction of the weir after the construction of the weir the 13 year average daily flow in the dry season was severely diminished thus being lower than the smaller e flows q95 and q90 as shown in fig 4 a and 4b the q95 q90 q75 and q50 dropped from 7 2 m3s 1 to 0 4 m3s 1 10 1 m3s 1 to 0 6 m3s 1 16 3 m3s 1 to 0 8 m3s 1 and 25 8 m3s 1 to 4 2 m3s 1 respectively after the weir operation in contrast the flow regime below the larger e flows q75 and q50 occurred only in the dry season before the weir construction as shown in fig 4c and 4d the results also revealed that the extremely high flow events rose significantly during the wet season after the weir construction we concluded that 1 the daily flows downstream were higher in the wet season and lower in the dry season after the in stream weir operation 2 the smaller environmental flows were significantly affected during the dry season whereas the larger environmental flows were impacted in all seasons the wavelet spectrum results for the daily flow change after wavelet transformation were discovered that the energy value increases with the increase of the time scale besides the regular gradient color alternately reflects the seasonal dynamics of the flow regimes as shown in fig 5 a and 5b this result exhibited that after the construction of yuanshan weir in 1983 the change of the 2 days scale flow amplitude was getting enlarged and the oscillation was relatively forceful which may be related to the periodic and regular water intake from the banxin water plant the gwps ratios between the 2 days scale and the annual scale were greater than 1 indicating that the degree of flow variation at this time scale is significantly different due to the construction of the weir as shown in fig 5c the gwps ratios peaked at six on the time scales from 2 days to 1 week and then decreased with increasing time scales until approaching one on annual scales similarly gdwps peaked between 2 days and 1 week scales and then gradually declined as the scale grew until the annual scale reached a minimum value as shown in fig 5d the findings suggest that the operation of the yuanshan weir has the most significant impact on the flow of the 2 days to 1 week scale but has little effect on the annual scale 3 2 changes in habitat structure according to the analysis of the flow characteristics before and after weir construction four kinds of e flow q95 q90 q75 and q50 before and after the weir operation performed as the upstream flow boundary conditions in srh 2d before conducting the hydrodynamic simulation of these scenarios this study carried out the verification of srh 2d for model verification we collected water levels from the gauge station within the study area from august 1 to august 15 in 2015 the water levels during this period contained normal tidal levels and flood levels during typhoon soudelor the numerical meshes and grids of the river channel are displayed in fig 1b and the verification result of the water levels is illustrated in fig 1c the results demonstrated quite matched to the measurement with the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of approximately 0 95 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 indicating the reliability of the srh 2d model simulations the habitat model calculation coupling with the hydrodynamic simulation results showed that the total water area declines under each flow rate which exhibits the overall impact on the habitat after the weir construction as shown in table 1 q75 has the most significant reduction from the water intake operation of the weir the dryland coverage within the study area accounted for more than 80 in comparison the proportion of the four habitat areas was 20 in all e flow scenarios glide was the primary aquatic habitat type which contributed the most to high quality habitat greater than12 followed by riffle 1 91 3 83 and pool 1 96 2 98 while run had the lowest contribution to habitat quality 1 except for glide other habitats were diminished due to the construction of the weir as shown in fig 6 a note that the pua value of glide and the corresponding habitat growth achieved the most significance under the q90 flow case run was the most degraded pursued by riffle and pool besides the proportion of almost all habitats declined with the decrease of e flow with run falling the most riffle second and pool the third whereas glide varied less obviously 3 3 fish habitat dynamics r candidianus and a paradoxus had the highest pua values ranging from 1 27 to 2 09 and 1 40 1 54 respectively the pua of f lacustre was followed 0 51 0 88 and o pachycephalus was the lowest 0 13 0 20 as shown in table 1 under higher e flow conditions q50 and q75 the pua of r candidianus was higher than that of a paradoxus conversely when the e flow was at lower stage q90 and q95 the pua of r candidianus was smaller than that of a paradoxus furthermore the pua values of all fish in all e flow scenarios decreased after the construction of the weir as shown in fig 6b the pua dropped in the q50 case was the highest and the pua diminished in the q75 q90 and q95 was roughly comparable the fish habitat area was conjoined with the classification by habitat quality to understand the variant habitat quality ratio of these four endemic fishes as shown in fig 7 before constructing the weir the medium and high quality habitat areas of r candidianus and a paradoxus were the highest among all fish species indicating that the study area was the most suitable for these two species of fish fig 7a the habitat area of r candidianus was ranked from high to low under various e flow conditions hq4 medium quality habitat highest hq3 low quality habitat and hq5 high quality habitat second and third hq1 non habitat followed and hq2 poor habitat had the lowest proportion with the enlargement in e flow the area occupied by each habitat quality increased except for the hq4 in contrast the habitat area of a paradoxus was ranked from high to low by following the order hq5 highest hq4 and hq3 second and third hq1 followed and hq2 had the lowest proportion besides a paradoxus has a more extensive high quality habitat area suggesting that it may have a more survival advantage than r candidianus as for the other two fishes the habitat suitability of o pachycephalus was slightly higher than that of f lacustre nevertheless the area of the high quality habitat of these two species was relatively low the suitable habitat area of each e flow after the weir construction was similar to before the weir construction as shown in fig 7b of the four endemic fish species f lacustresuffered the most damaging consequence from the weir operation on suitable habitats including low medium and high quality habitats the differences in habitat quality before and after weir construction showed a degraded direction as shown in fig 7c in the case of q75 the proportion of habitat with medium and high quality habitats declined the most and q90 ranked the second indicating that the water intake from the weir most significantly influences the two e flows in addition the non habitat area hq1 increased after the construction of the weir occurred in the cases of two smaller e flows q90 and q95 the results may indicate that the water area lowered and the habitat unsuitable for fish raised we concluded that although the weir construction has different degrees of negative impact on the various e flow and fish species it generally diminishes the proportion of suitable habitats which may strengthen the environmental stress of aquatic organisms moreover the fish habitat area habitat type and habitat quality classification were further incorporated and analyzed as shown in fig 8 except for the glide habilitated by r candidianus at q95 q75 and q50 the habitat quality of the other habitat types at all e flows was reduced as shown in fig 8a among all the habitats used by r candidianus only the habitat quality of glide was not significantly impacted by the weir we also found that the riffle used by r candidianus had the most prominent degradation in habitat quality the habitat quality degradation of a paradoxus was similar to that of r candidianus as shown in fig 8b however unlike r candidianus habitat quality variation a paradoxus had the highest reduction in the proportion of high quality habitat hq5 in pool habitat this finding may imply that a paradoxus prefers the pool habitat which was most affected by the weir indicated in fig 6 as well the riffle of o pachycephalus had the highest reduction in the proportion of suitable habitat as shown in fig 8c the proportion of suitable habitat for riffle increased slightly in the case of low e flow q95 changes in the run habitat ratio of o pachycephalus demonstrated a general degradation of habitat quality due to the weir in the pool habitat except for the high e flow q50 found the raised proportion of high quality habitat the habitat quality of the other habitat types was degraded unlike other habitat types o pachycephalus had a slightly increasing proportion of suitable habitat in the glide habitat after the weir operation the sum of the proportions of suitable habitats hq3 hq4 hq5 for all habitat types of f lacustre showed a decreasing trend as shown in fig 8d this result may reflect the significant degradation of the overall habitat quality of f lacustre caused by the weir this finding is consistent with the results of figs 6 and 7 described above we also found that under the e flow condition of q75 the run habitat suffered the most negative impact which should be paid special attention to in future habitat restoration 4 discussion the freshwater flow regime is the key factor shaping the ecosystem process poff and zimmerman 2010 determining the e flow is critically important to sustain river ecosystems but is always challenging arthington et al 2006 akter and ali 2012 according to the statistics of daily flow data downstream of yuanshan weir in this study the water intake of the weir caused significant changes in the flow characteristics such as the frequency and amplitude of the flow regimes figs 3 and 4 from the analysis of the difference of wavelet energy spectrum this study discovered that after the construction of the weir the wavelet has a relatively regular flow amplitude transformation on the 2 days scale the amplitude difference between the 2 days and 1 week scales is noticeable the oscillation was intense which regarding the banxin water plant was related to the periodic and regular short term and long term water intake operations the amplitude of low frequency with high power frequently appears at different scales after the construction of the weir which was presumed to be related to the artificial regulation of forced flood discharge during the wet season after the construction of the yuanshan weir the variation period of dry season was shortened to about one year indicating that the changes in the flow of the rivers tended to be frequent and rapid and the average annual flow showed a downward trend as a whole the results showed that the operation of yuanshan weir increased the variability of the flow regime of the downstream channel and induced the flow regime of the river to be relatively unstable the gwps ratios of the 13 years before and after are all greater than one reflecting that the overall flow oscillation after the construction of the weir was relatively severe at whole time scales both of the peaks of gwps ratio and gdwps occurred between the 2 days and 1 week scales revealing that the flow from these scales was most affected by the water intake from the weir fig 5 e flows could contribute meaningfully and desired conservation effects on the aquatic community composition of fishes and macroinvertebrates depending on the magnitude of the flow and on the specific habitat type pander et al 2019 we found that the 2 days to 1 week time scale flow discharges are approximately equal to q95 to q50 denoting the demand of e flows of the dahan river besides in the range from 2 days to 1 week from 1970 to 1982 before the weir construction the spectral color band remained in the blue part with yellow green stripes interspersed intermittently in addition to the phenomenon mentioned above the spectral characteristics from 1983 to 1995 after the weir construction also appeared pink stripes interspersed with blue bands this phenomenon shows that the downstream flow of the yuanshan weir has been significantly influenced after the construction affiliated to the flood discharge from the weir during the wet season habitat models that consider the relationship between hydrological factors and habitat conditions have been widely used to quantify seasonal habitat variations nukazawa et al 2011 evaluate habitat quality mocq et al 2013 and determine environmental flow akter and tanim 2018 stamou et al 2018 hydrodynamic simulation and habitat type calculation were carried out in this study for eight scenarios including q95 to q50 before and after the weir construction obtained from the time series exceedance probability after constructing this weir the downstream water area due to the use of river water resources is significantly reduced and the proportion of the total water area reduction is the largest under the q75 situation table 1 this finding may reveal that the river system is not healthy enough with the low water area the environmental stress of the aquatic ecosystem would be dramatically increased once the e flow was lowered the present study found that those glide habitats were more suitable for slow creatures after construction increased fig 6 however a significant increase in the percentage of a single habitat would reduce the coverage of other habitats thereby lowering habitat diversity glide may be beneficial for specific organisms but the enlargement of its coverage area may be harmful to river systems moreover the habitat run was most degraded in all flow scenarios while the other habitat type that was significantly negatively impacted was the riffle the most apparent change was discovered among the eight flow conditions at q75 thus the impact of this level of e flow demands on habitat conservation deserves attention we suggest that the weir management authorities formulate a set of continuous flow releases instead of pulsed discharges during the dry season so as to maintain a relatively stable e flow random release mode is recommended if pulsed is used which may help slow down the fluctuation of downstream flow and reduce the environmental stress of aquatic organisms van niekerk et al 2012 chilton et al 2021 ecological variables across multiple spatial scales are critical when creating refuges and maintaining landscape level processes labbe and fausch 2000 newson and newson 2000 found the primary concern of river management should be the relationship between the habitat pattern and the biological responses for example carnie et al 2016 linked the observed spawning location for chinook salmon with the predicted spatial distribution of habitat patches their results confirmed that the size of habitat patches was one of the most critical factors in defining the condition of a river environment hitchman et al 2018 quantified species habitat relationships within mesohabitats to identify the keystone habitats that influence fish species richness besides the quantified prediction of the river responses to specific disorders leading to the disconnection in the river is necessary for river management yi et al 2010 wohl 2017 kuo et al 2021 suggested creating refuge and feeding habitats through channel morphology modification to benefit endemic fishes during the dry season pander et al 2021 regarded the restoration plan of fluctuating water levels and discharges as mitigating the influenced timing and amplitude of environmental flows for alpine rivers the present study found similar results and conclude that supplying a random flow discharge to satisfy a natural flow regime in the dry season is critically important hydrological connectivity can be generated by freshwater flow from catchment to ocean longitudinally and laterally from exchanges with intertidal and littoral habitats and estuary duggan et al 2019 chilton et al 2021 freshwater flows often shape the habitat requirements for migrating organisms such as endemic fish schrandt et al 2015 pander et al 2022 found that egg and larva mortalities of salmonid spawning habitats were significantly higher in the hydropeaking affected site than in non affected sites regarding the proportion of habitat types the present study found that the habitats became monotonic after the construction of the weir and the reduction of the water area resulted in the overall decline of the habitat quality dynamic management for flow regimes that comprise environmental flows and flood extremes could sustain high conservation value in freshwater biodiversity pander et al 2019 knott et al 2021 found that anthropogenic alterations such as the weir construction led to a loss of habitat quantity quality and connectivity for riverine fish species they also concluded that the resulting reduction of freshwater fishes had prompted the improvement of spawning habitat quality for addressing bottlenecks in fish life cycles because the suitable water environment of these endemic fishes with different habitat conditions is different in different life cycle we suggest local construction for the degraded vital habitats especially in the dry season the habitat type with the most considerable reduction in area ratio was run and riffle so it is recommended to put more effort into the habitat creation in addition if there is enough hinterland for off channel water storage to replace the current in river weir the negative impacts on natural flow regimes and fish habitat quality would be mitigated significantly this study indicated the importance of modifying weir operation to provide near natural flow regimes and restoring the degraded habitats for essential fish habitat conservation 5 conclusion this study develops a comprehensive methodology including the wavelet analysis model exceedance probability approach hydrodynamic and habitat models to quantify environmental flow demand and structural habitat of endemic fishes with and without in river structures we found that the weir evidently altered river hydrology and aquatic ecosystem including flow regime habitat structure and fish habitat quality the flow difference between dry and wet seasons became more extensive indicating the alternative flow regime downstream the deviation of daily flow significantly raised after the weir construction indicating the flow rates decline in the dry season and enlarge in the wet season the habitat types run and riffle were most degraded and the endemic fish species f lacustre suffered the most damaging consequences on suitable habitat quality and quantity induced by the weir water intake we accordingly propose alternative mitigations such as random discharge schemes and rehabilitation programs based on the critical findings of the present study declaration of competing interest the

2673,rainfall interception ri by forest canopy is an important part of the ecohydrology cycle influenced by rainfall characteristics weather conditions forest structures and their interactions rainfall events with different amounts are likely to change the ways that rainfall interacts with forest canopies and consequently vary the effects of influential variables on ri markedly thus analyzing the influential variables on ri separately according to rainfall amounts need further attention in this study rainfall partitioning was measured in 60 plots of four forest types during june to september from 2017 to 2019 weather conditions were obtained from four weather stations spatially representing all the study plots detailed canopy structural variables were retrieved from the terrestrial laser scanning then boosted regression trees brt analyses were performed to evaluate the contributing variables of ri at different rainfall amounts as a result a total of 77 rainfall events were measured and 43 19 and 15 events were classified as light rainfall events lr gross rainfall 10 mm middle rainfall events mr 10 mm gross rainfall 25 mm and heavy rainfall events hr gross rainfall 25 mm the average values of ri amounts the difference between gross rainfall and the sum of throughfall and stemflow for lr mr and lr were 2 0 mm 3 5 mm and 6 6 mm respectively the average ri proportions the proportion of ri amount to gross rainfall for lr mr and hr were 74 8 20 2 and 17 1 respectively both ri amount and ri proportion were significantly different among the rainfall amount levels lr mr and hr brt results showed that for all rainfall amount levels together ri amount was governed by rainfall amount followed by canopy interception index cii and humidity whereas ri proportion was most influenced by cii followed by rainfall amount humidity and average canopy height ach as expected for a given rainfall amount level rainfall amount was the most influential variable on ri amount naturally the most influential variable on ri proportion varied with rainfall amount levels for lr and mr the most influential variables were cii while it was humidity for hr furthermore a variety of significant variables with the relative influence value higher than the averaged value such as rainfall intensity wind speed and ach intricately and complexly affected ri amount and proportion at each rainfall amount level in addition the rainfall amount exerted a stepwise positive correlation with ri amount cii showed a stepwise positive and humidity a negative influence on ri proportion respectively a comprehensive understanding of the influence variable on ri at distinct rainfall amount levels provides valuable insights into how forest canopies intercept rainfall and

boosted regression trees terrestrial laser scanning temperate forest data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rainfall interception ri is the rainfall retained in the canopy and then evaporates back into the atmosphere generally ri varies greatly at the forest stand with ri amount the difference with gross rainfall and the sum of throughfall and stemflow ranging from 1 8 mm to 6 5 mm and ri proportion the proportion of ri amount to gross rainfall ranging from 10 to 50 in temperate forests barbier et al 2009 he et al 2014 ri has various ecological and hydrological functions such as reducing the kinetic energy of rainfall drops goebes et al 2015 levia et al 2017 mitigating soil erosion nanko et al 2016a seitz et al 2017 regulating the water storage in litter and soil layers nanko et al 2010 uhlenbrook 2006 influencing chemical deposition kristensen et al 2004 zhu et al 2018 total evaporation savenije 2004 and global water supply murray 2014 because of its important role it is essential to evaluate the influential variables on ri ri varies considerably for forest stands as a function of forest structures e g tree height basal area surface area of leaf branch and stem and meteorological variables meteorological variables are further divided into two groups in studies del campo et al 2018 li et al 2016a including rainfall characteristics e g rainfall amount rainfall intensity rainfall duration and meteorological conditions e g wind speed temperature humidity however up to now there is no consensus on the effects of variables on ri for example some studies showed that ri increased with the increase of wind speed reid and lewis 2009 staelens et al 2008 this was because the higher wind speed raised the evaporation rate according to the penman monteith equation however other studies suggested that higher wind speed resulted in lower ri iida et al 2017 van stan et al 2014 this could be explained by an assumption that wind shook the canopy causing splash and channeling more rainfall into throughfall another example the raindrop diameter was also regarded as either increasing or decreasing ri calder 1996a zabret et al 2018 the conflicting information may be because that the three groups of influential variables are interdependent to create a complete picture of effects of different variables on ri it is essential to analyse these variables together generally the effect of variables on ri are different between the deciduous and coniferous tree species li et al 2016a zabret et al 2018 between the leafed and leafless periods nanko et al 2016b tanaka et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 between the young and old trees pypker et al 2005 between general weather conditions zabret and šraj 2021 between canopy phenologies tanaka et al 2015 and between the diverse tree species del campo et al 2018 li et al 2016a van stan et al 2014 therefore in order to analyze the effects of variables on ri considering the species or morphologies of trees the relationships between influential variables and ri are studied separately according to the tree characters mentioned above additionally rainfall amount is reported as the most important variable that influences ri in many studies staelens et al 2008 zabret and šraj 2019 rainfall events with different amounts vary the effects that rainfall interacts with forest canopy mali et al 2020 park and cameron 2008 siles et al 2010 for example forest canopy redistributes rainfall and rainfall simultaneously changes the inclination of leaves and branches and consequently the changed forest canopy directly influences canopy storage capacity fathizadeh et al 2017 the changed forest canopy together with weather conditions may also regulate the rate or amount of evaporation deguchi et al 2006 thus rainfall events with different amounts are likely to vary the effect of influential variables on ri markedly however analyzing the influential variables on ri separately according to rainfall amounts has been less investigated in the context of all three group variables in addition previous ri studies involved forest stands and individual mature trees where many structure characteristics could not be accurately measured due to the high three dimensional spatial variability herwitz and slye 1995 roth et al 2007 yu et al 2020 to accurately investigate the relationship between ri and structural variables the detailed structural variables are collected from shrubs yuan et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 or small trees li et al 2016a in the field yuan et al 2016 or laboratory li et al 2016a however whether the relationships are applicable to forest stand in the field remains unclear terrestrial laser scanning tls is a state of the art active remote sensing technology which can offer an opportunity to rapidly and accurately describe the three dimensional forest structures on forest stand liang et al 2016 thus the tls derived structure variables may allow a reliable relationship between ri and forest structure for example yu et al 2020 reported that the tls derived canopy interception index cii showed a stronger performance to ri than other structural variables meanwhile the tls derived structure variables such as lai pai cii have not yet been fully explored in the analysis of the relationships between ri and forest canopies hence four forest types including korean pine pinus koraiensis plantation forest kpf larch larix spp plantation forest lpf mixed broadleaved forest mbf and mongolian oak quercus mongolica forest mof are common in northeastern china where water scarcity has become an increasing threat to sustainable development and where large scale re forestation efforts are altering rainfall distribution and regional water budgets with the aid of tls technology to investigate forest structures this study aimed to analyze rainfall characteristics meteorological conditions and forest structures together and to identify the most influential variables on ri among different levels of rainfall amounts the main objectives of this study were as follows 1 to compare ri amount the difference of gross rainfall and the sum of throughfall and stemflow and ri proportion the proportion of ri amount to gross rainfall among different rainfall amount levels 2 to understand the influences of rainfall characteristics meteorological conditions and forest structures on ri at all rainfall events 3 to explore the influential variables on ri separately according to rainfall amount levels the comprehensive combination of three groups of variables especially the detailed structural variables extracted from the tls will draw more robust conclusions on influential variables on ri the exploration of the influence variables on ri at distinct rainfall amount levels can provide insights that the effect ways of influence variables on ri may be different among rainfall amount levels 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was carried out in qingyuan forest cern chinese ecosystem research network a permanent field research site established by the chinese academy of sciences in northeast china 41 51 n 124 54 e fig 1 the study area has a continental monsoon climate with the mean annual temperature ranging from 3 9 to 5 4 the average frost free period is 130 days the soil type is typical brown soil with the soil depth of 30 60 cm yang and zhu 2015 annual precipitation including rainfall and snow ranges from 700 to 850 mm and annual rainfall is from 450 to 650 mm nearly 70 of which falls in summer yu et al 2020 the study area is located in the headwater of protection zone where forests provide protection of water regulation and supply for the cities downstream the protection zone is uninhabited currently natural secondary stands accompanying with mosaic plantations form the typical temperate secondary forest ecosystems there the dominant tree species include betula platyphylla fraxinus mandshurica manchurian walnut populus davidiana quercus mongolica larix spp and pinus koraiensis zhu et al 2018 korean pine pinus koraiensis plantation forest kpf larch larix spp plantation forest lpf mixed broadleaved forest mbf and mongolian oak quercus mongolica forest mof were selected in the study area to represent typical natural forests and plantation forests as well as typical broadleaved and coniferous forests for each forest type four to six study sites were set with a dimension of 30 20 m fig 1 in the middle locations of the slope and the slope degrees ranged from 20 to 35 there are differences in structural variables i e basal area average canopy height and canopy cover among the study sites and the detailed comparison can be seen from yu et al 2020 the complex forest structures of study sites are subdivided into more homogeneous units therefore for each site three plots with a dimension of 6 6 m three tree units in each plot at least andré et al 2008 were chosen to measure ri and structural variables 2 2 measurement of gross rainfall throughfall and stemflow the gross rainfall throughfall and stemflow were measured during july to september growing and rainy season in 2017 2018 and 2019 with the tipping bucket rain gauge witu sf automatic precipitation sensors weitu inc shenyang liaoning china the rain gauge automatically records rainfall with an interval of 30 min the minimum measure value was 0 2 mm two sample sites at an open area were selected to measure gross rainfall ensuring that all the experiment sites within a distance of 1 000 m to either of the center site fig 1 to ensure that the canopy would dry out the dynamics of water intercepted in canopy were observed at the fields the rainfall events were separated by an interval of 8 h in windy weather wind speed 1 5 m s or 12 h in calm weather wind speed 1 5 m s based on observation he et al 2014 the detailed descriptions of the gross rainfall throughfall and stemflow measurements can be found from yu et al 2020 because inflow into the bucket continues during tipping the tipping bucket rain gauge cannot measure the inflow during tripping leading an underestimation of the actual inflow referring to the equations showing relationships between the scaled inflow rate and the actual volume of a single tip suggested by iida et al 2012 the systematic underestimations of gross rainfall throughfall and stemflow by the rain gauge were corrected in this study ri was expressed as 1 ri amount mm and 2 ri proportion the ri amount was calculated as the difference between gross rainfall and the sum of throughfall and stemflow and the ri proportion was calculated as a proportion of the ri amount when compared with gross rainfall 2 3 measurement of meteorological conditions temperature humidity wind speed and vapor pressure deficit were reported as meteorological conditions influencing ri tanaka et al 2015 nanko et al 2016a meteorological conditions mentioned above were measured from four meteorological stations including the qingyuan forest cern meteorological station i e qyf ms maws310 vaisala finland and the multi tower platforms of qingyuan forest cern meteorological stations closed path eddy covariance 310 campbell scientific inc usa atmospheric profile 200 campbell scientific inc usa i e mbf tower platform mbf tp mof tower platform mof tp and lpf tower platform lpf tp all the experiment sites were sited within a distance of 1000 m to any of the four meteorological stations consistent with the measurement time of rainfall the meteorological conditions from qyf ms were measured ranging from july to september in 2017 2018 and 2019 nevertheless the meteorological conditions of mbf tp mof tp and lpf tp were only measured from july to september in 2019 all data were measured automatically with an interval of one hour 2 4 estimation of forest structural variables 2 4 1 tls data collection and preprocessing tls point clouds the data collected by tls with a large amount of y z coordinates were collected with a pentax s 3180 v terrestrial laser scanner tiasahi japan mounted on a tripod during the leaf on 13th to 22th april and leaf off 20th to 25th august seasons in 2017 for each site fig 2 a multi location scanning was used to collect the complete information of study sites with the leaf on of 10 and the leaf off of 6 respectively liang et al 2016 6 referencing targets with high reflectance were set up in each site to register the collected tls point clouds from different scans leaf on and leaf off seasons of each site were separately registered with the iterative closest point algorithm besl and mckay 1992 the final registration errors of all sites were lower than 7 mm fig 2 b the registered data fig 2 b were further processed to generate normalized point clouds that excluded the effect of topography during the calculation of y coordinates height of point clouds fig 2 e first the registered data of leaf on and leaf off seasons were separately merged in cloudcompare software open source software version 2 6 1 and then the point clouds of the site were clipped from the merged point clouds fig 2 c second in order to improve the accuracy of the subsequent data processing noise point clouds were removed with statistical outlier removal algorithm fig 2 c third filtering was processed in the terrasolid s terrascan software terrasolid ltd helsinki finland version 5 011 classifying the point clouds into ground and non ground point clouds the point clouds of vegetation aboveground fig 2 d fourthly a digital elevation model dem was extracted from the ground point clouds with the ordinary kriging method and then the point clouds were normalized based on the non ground point clouds and dem fig 2 e finally point clouds of the three plots were clipped from each site fig 2 f 2 4 2 structural variables extraction one dimensional variables average canopy height ach two dimensional variables basal area ba leaf area index lai plant area index pai and three dimensional variables optical stratification porosity osp canopy interception index cii cubic density cd related to ri were extracted from the normalized tls point clouds of each plot ach was retrieved from the normalized leaf on point clouds the plot was first divided into grid cells with a size of 3 m 3 m that was approximately equal to the mean projected canopy area of a tree the stand density was nearly 1000 trees per ha then ach was calculated by the average value of the maximum z values of the grid cells ba was calculated from dbh diameter at breast height that was retrieved from the point clouds with a height between 1 25 and 1 35 m above the ground within this slice all circular point clusters were detected with dbscan density based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm tao et al 2015 and then the circle fitting algorithm pueschel et al 2013 was used to calculate the diameters of circles i e dbh of trees osp represents the proportion of sky hemisphere not obscured by tree elements downward to a horizontal plane at a given height inside a forest stand zhu et al 2003 in this study the point clouds were first arranged in x y grids of which the dimension was determined by the mean minimum distance li et al 2016b the mean minimum distance was calculated as follows first for a given point in point clouds its nearest neighboring point was searched and the distance from the point to the nearest point was identified as the minimum distance then the minimum distances of all points were averaged as mean minimum distance based on the point clouds arranged in x y grids those grids with at least one point represented occupied or else represented non occupied osp was calculated as a ratio i e the number of non occupied cells to the number of all cells osp was calculated at 1 5 ach 2 5 ach 3 5 ach and 4 5 ach corresponding to the calculated height the structure variables were named as osph 5 osp2h 5 osp3h 5 osp4h 5 cd is defined as the ratio of vegetation volume to whole canopy value zhou et al 2002 in this study the point clouds were first arranged in x y z voxels 3d space composed of adjacent cubic cells of specific dimension of which the dimension was also determined by the mean minimum distance li et al 2016b and thus those voxels with at least one point represented occupied or else represented non occupied cd was calculated as a ratio i e the number of occupied voxels to the number of all voxels the variables used to describe surface areas including lai pai and cii were extracted based on the wood leaf separation that aimed to retrieve the leaf branch and stem point clouds respectively the detailed descriptions of wood leaf separation as well as lai pai and cii calculation can be found in yu et al 2020 2 5 statistical analysis referring to the rainfall amount levels classification of china meteorological administration and related researches carlyle moses and schooling 2015 siles et al 2010 rainfall events were classified into three levels based on rainfall amount i e light rainfall events lr gross rainfall 10 mm middle rainfall events mr 10 mm gross rainfall 25 mm and heavy rainfall events hr gross rainfall 25 mm one way anova and tukey s hsd test were applied to distinguish the effects of rainfall amount levels i e lr mr and hr on ri amount and ri proportion using the multcomp hothorn et al 2021 package in r software r core team 2020 boosted regression trees brt have gained popularity in recent studies of influence variables on ri del campo et al 2018 nanko et al 2016b tanaka et al 2017 zabret et al 2018 in this study brt models were performed separately at all rainfall events and at part rainfall events the part rainfall events corresponded to three rainfall amount levels i e lr mr and hr the response variables were ri amount and ri proportion for the four rainfall groups the predictor variables were rainfall characteristics i e rainfall amount rainfall intensity and rainfall duration meteorological conditions i e temperature humidity wind speed and vapor pressure deficit structural variables i e ach ba osph 5 osp2h 5 osp3h 5 osp4h 5 lai pai cii and cd to avoid potential collinearity r 0 6 between the structural variables following the data exploration protocol of zuur et al 2010 the pairwise person correlation coefficient was calculated with the hmisc harrell and dupont 2020 package in r software due to the problems of automatic tipping bucket rain gauge as well as the incomplete measurement of meteorological conditions a total of 2375 records were collected for all rainfall events among which 1299 records for lr 530 records for mr and 546 records for hr brt combines the strengths of two algorithms regression trees models that relate a response to their predictors and boosted model an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance introducing some randomness into a boosted model usually improves accuracy and reduces overfitting elith et al 2008 in this study brt was fitted using a gaussian response type with a learning rate the rate of shrinking the contribution of each simple model to brt of 0 005 a tree complexity the number of nodes in a tree of 4 a bag fraction the proportion of data to be selected for model building of 0 75 relative influence value riv of predictor variable on the response variable was computed based on the number of times that the variable was selected for splitting riv was weighted by the squared improvement to model as a result of each split and averaged over all trees elith et al 2008 riv of each variable was scaled so that the sum added to 100 with higher value indicating stronger influence on the response variable as a threshold value indicating the significant influence of the variables on ri a value of 9 1 100 divided by 11 the number of variables was set zabret et al 2018 the significant influential variables were plotted with partial dependence plots pdp that showed the individual effect of each predictor on ri brt models were performed in r software with package gbm ridgeway 2020 3 results 3 1 influential variables of ri a total of 77 rainfall events were recorded 24 rainfall events in 2017 25 rainfall events in 2018 and 28 rainfall events in 2019 respectively 43 19 and 15 rainfall events were classified as light rainfall events lr gross rainfall 10 mm middle rainfall events mr 10 mm gross rainfall 25 mm and heavy rainfall events hr gross rainfall 25 mm as shown in fig 3 the total rainfall amount was 1083 3 mm and the single rainfall amount ranged from 0 2 to 75 9 mm with an average value of 14 1 mm sd 15 8 mm rainfall duration ranged from 0 2 h to 31 h with an averaged value of 5 4 h sd 5 8 h based on rainfall amount and rainfall duration rainfall intensity was calculated as ranging from 0 1 mm h 1 to 12 5 mm h 1 with an average value of 2 6 mm h 1 sd 2 5 mm h 1 meteorological variables of study plots during each rainfall event were calculated from the four meteorological stations respectively based on the average values of meteorological variables per rainfall event the meteorological variables of four meteorological stations were compared table 1 due to the opposite aspects between mbf tp and mof tp the humidity of mbf tp 86 5 9 8 was significantly higher than that of mof tp 80 2 10 6 however except for humidity the other three meteorological conditions showed no statistical differences among the meteorological stations of mbf tp mof tp and lpf tp table 1 compared with the other three meteorological stations qyf ms had a higher humidity and wind speed lower vapor pressure deficit p 0 05 structural variables of study plots showed large variations table 2 the ach of lpf was higher than the other forest types kpf showed the highest ba among the four forest types while mof had the highest cd for each forest type osp steadily increased with the increasing height inside the forest stand however for each height inside the forest stand the largest osp was found in different forest types as expected the coniferous forests had higher surface area related parameters lai pai and cii than broadleaved forests table 2 to avoid potential collinearity in brt analysis the pairwise pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between the structural variables fig s1 based on the correlation coefficient and the set value r 0 6 the structural variables were carefully chosen and the retained structural variables were ach osp3h 5 cii and cd 3 2 ri amount and ri proportion at different rainfall amount levels for all rainfall events ri amount ranged from 0 3 mm to 13 0 mm with an average value of 3 3 mm sd 2 1 mm while ri proportion ranged from 6 3 to 100 with an average value of 38 7 sd 32 3 to account for the effect of rainfall amount on ri ri amount and ri proportion were calculated in three rainfall amount levels fig 4 the average values of ri amount for lr mr and hr were 2 0 mm 3 5 mm and 6 6 mm respectively the ri amount of hr was significantly higher than those of mr and lr p 0 01 and the ri amount of mr was significantly higher than that of lr p 0 01 the average values of ri proportion for lr mr and hr were 74 8 20 2 17 1 respectively contrary to ri amount the ri proportion of hr was significantly lower than those of mr and lr p 0 01 and the ri proportion of mr was significantly lower than that of lr p 0 01 3 3 influential variables on ri amount and proportion for all rainfall events together brt analysis showed that ri amount was most influenced by rainfall amount with 55 7 of relative influence value riv fig 5 a the second and third influential variables were cii and humidity with 15 9 and 12 1 of riv fig 5 a the rivs of other influential variables were less than the threshold value of 9 9 fig 5 a partial dependence plots pdp showed that rainfall amount ranging from 0 mm to 76 mm exerted a staged positive correlation with ri amount fig 6 additionally ri amount appeared to increase sharply with cii ranging from 5 to 10 whereas increased slowly as long as cii greater than 10 fig 6 contrary to rainfall amount and cii humidity exerted a stepwise negative influence on ri amount fig 6 when classifying all the influential variables into three groups i e rainfall characteristics meteorological conditions and forest structures ri amount was mostly governed by rainfall characteristics with 62 2 of riv table 3 whereas forest structures and meteorological conditions were the second and third governing variables with 23 3 and 14 6 of riv table 3 in contrast the ri proportion was most influenced by cii 31 4 of riv followed in descending order by rainfall amount humidity and ach 25 7 14 3 and 10 4 of riv respectively while the other variables were less than the threshold value fig 5 b pdp indicated that the ri proportion increased sharply with cii ranging from 5 to 10 whereas increased slowly as cii greater than 10 fig 6 which is similar to the pdp of the ri amount with cii also a staged positive impact of ach on the ri proportion was found fig 6 on the contrary rainfall amount and humidity exerted negative influences on the ri proportion fig 6 the ri proportion decreased sharply with rainfall amount increasing from 0 mm to 17 mm and then decreased slowly as rainfall amount larger than 17 mm fig 6 the ri proportion decreased sharply with humidity higher than 90 fig 6 when classifying all the influential variables into three groups the ri proportion was most affected by forest structures 44 6 of riv while rainfall characteristics and meteorological conditions 33 and 22 4 of riv respectively were the second and third effected variables table 3 3 4 influential variables on ri amount and proportion at each rainfall amount level analyzing influential factors on ri amount and ri proportion at each rainfall amount level showed that a variety of variables intricately and complexly affected ri fig 7 fig s2 and table 3 rainfall amount exerted an overwhelming influence on ri amount in lr mr and hr levels with 73 6 44 8 and 35 3 of riv respectively fig 7 a b c along with the reduction of rainfall amount riv riv of cii and ach showed an obvious gain at the mr level while riv of humidity and wind speed showed an obvious gain at the hr level fig 7 a b c at the mr level pdp showed that cii and ach exerted a staged positive correlation with ri amount fig s2 at the hr level humidity exhibited a stepwise negative correlation with ri amount fig s2 nevertheless the ri amount increased up to wind speed of 2 1 m s 1 and then decreased with wind speed increasing fig s2 when classifying all the influential variables into three groups ri amounts of lr mr and hr were all most affected by rainfall characteristics 87 5 55 2 and 42 9 of riv respectively table 3 the effects of forest structures and meteorological conditions at the lr level 7 9 and 4 7 of riv respectively were weaker table 3 compared to the lr level the effect of forest structures at the mr level 32 4 of riv increased table 3 and the effect of meteorological conditions at the hr level 36 8 of riv also increased obviously table 3 in contrast cii showed an overwhelming influence on ri proportion at the lr and mr levels 34 and 33 5 of riv while humidity was the most influential variable on ri proportion at the hr level 34 9 of riv it was worth noting that rainfall amount and rainfall intensity were significantly influential variables for ri proportion at all rainfall amount levels ach was a significant influential variable at the lr and hr levels while wind speed was a significant influential variable at the mr and hr levels when classifying all the influential variables into three groups the ri proportions of lr and mr were most affected by forest structures 56 3 and 47 9 of riv respectively whereas the ri proportion of hr was most influenced by meteorological conditions 46 8 of riv 4 discussion 4 1 ri amount and ri proportion at different rainfall amount levels when combining all rainfall events together the average value of the ri amount ranges from 1 8 mm to 6 5 mm while the average value of the ri proportion ranges from 10 to 50 in temperate forests he et al 2014 iida et al 2017 liu et al 2018 in this study the average values of ri amount and ri proportion were respectively 3 3 mm and 38 7 and the values were within the range of previous studies however when the ri amount and ri proportion were calculated among the three rainfall amount levels i e lr mr and hr ri amount value was largest in hr 6 6 mm followed in descending order by mr 3 5 mm and lr 2 0 mm while the ri proportion showed the opposite order i e largest in lr 74 8 followed by mr 20 2 and hr 17 1 the values of ri amount in hr and ri proportion in lr were not in the above intervals this may be partly because the rainfall events with different amounts rainfall amount levels cause a variation of the interaction between rainfall and forest canopies mali et al 2020 park and cameron 2008 siles et al 2010 thus analyzing the influential variables on ri separately according to rainfall amount need further attention in a similar study by selecting the different threshold values of rainfall amount zabret and šraj 2019 investigated the influence of rain event characteristics on ri the methods of threshold value selection based on the multiple correspondence analysis and sensitivity analysis were really useful for evaluating the influential variable on ri 4 2 influential variables on ri amount and proportion rainfall amount was recognized as the most influential variable on ri amount whether for all rainfall events together or for each rainfall amount level alone fig 5 fig 7 as previously reported by other studies šraj et al 2008 staelens et al 2008 zabret and šraj 2019 although the ri amount is known to increase with rainfall amount the relationship types are described as linear fathizadeh et al 2017 power sun et al 2018 or exponential crockford and richardson 2000 in this study rainfall amount exerted a staged positive correlation with ri amount fig 6 this may be the result of overwhelming influences of rainfall amount and intricate effects of other variables on ri siles et al 2010 zabret and šraj 2021 ri proportion was most influenced by cii for all rainfall events together as well as for lr and mr fig 5 and fig 7 as a forest descriptor cii may be the first index defined to predict ri specially the surface areas and water storage capacities of all tree components leaf branch and stem are considered in the definition of cii yu et al 2020 in addition terrestrial laser scanning tls provides an accurate calculation of cii by avoiding the saturation effect garcía et al 2015 therefore the riv of cii was found higher than that of other structural variables fig 5 similarly the performance of cii to predict ri was also found better than that of other structural variables yu et al 2020 in the case of ri proportion in hr humidity was the dominant variable fig 7 exerting a stepwise negative influence on ri proportion fig s2 zabret et al 2018 reported that humidity was one of the most influential variables on rainfall partitioning for birch trees which was partially supported by this study lower humidity contributes to larger quantities of water retained by tree components leaf branch and stem and thus increase the canopy storage capacity levia and germer 2015 yu et al 2020 in addition compared with lr and mr humidity showed the largest riv in hr whether for ri amount or ri proportion fig 7 this may be because the rainfall amount in hr is more feasible to induce the tree components to get the maximum storage capacities levia and germer 2015 rainfall intensity as an important influencing variable was recognized several times by both brt models of ri amount and ri proportion fig 7 ri may decrease with higher rainfall intensity which is probably due to the consequence of high rainfall intensity creating splash and channeling of more rainfall into throughfall herwitz 1987 kermavnar and vilhar 2017 toba and ohta 2005 this phenomenon is expecially recongnized for trees with smoother bark surfaces and more flexible leaves zabret and šraj 2021 also other studies reported that the maximum canopy storage and ri decreased with the increasing of drop volume and drop diameter levia et al 2017 zabret et al 2018 those results are partially supported in this study by the pdp of rainfall intensity for ri amount and ri proportion the pdp of rainfall intensity showed ri amount of mr and hr decreased with rainfall intensity increasing as well as the ri proportion of lr mr and hr fig s2 whereas the ri amount of lr exerted a positive correlation with rainfall intensity 1 6 mm h 1 fig s2 this phenomenon was supported by calder et al 1996b who reported that ri would be higher for samller raindrop diameters ach was also recognized as an influencing variable several times by both brt models of ri amount and ri proportion fig 7 compared with tree height ach calculated based on tls point clouds quantifies the canopy height of forest plot more precisely furthermore ach is an efficient index for accurately predicting ri yu et al 2020 ach exerted a positive correlation with ri fig s2 this because that higher ach is probably to induce larger surface areas of tree components and thus increase canopy storage capacities liu 1998 moreover higher ach contributes to a higher canopy roughness and a more effective energy exchange with the atmosphere which results in higher ri dietz et al 2006 the noticeable influence of wind speed on ri amount for hr was confirmed as well as on ri proportion for mr fig 7 ri amount and ri proportion increased with wind speed increasing with threshold values of 1 3 m s 1 and 2 2 m s 1 respectively fig s2 and then exerted a negative correlation with wind speed according to the penman monteith equation wind speed increases the evaporation rate and that increases ri reid and lewis 2009 however higher wind speed may shake the canopy causing the loss of the intercepted rainfall and then decreases ri nanko et al 2006 van stan et al 2014 additionally distinct to noticeable influences on ri amount for hr and ri proportion for mr wind speed in other models showed lower riv that is in accordance with the studies that observed the negligible influence of wind speed on ri zabret et al 2018 4 3 the accuracy and uncertainty of brt analyses data on a total of 77 rainfall events and their canopy partitioning data were measured and recorded from 60 study plots in four forest types in temperate forests during june to september from 2017 to 2019 as a result more than 2000 records 1299 records for lr 530 records for mr and 546 records for hr were collected for brt models the adequate records provided highly reliable accuracy for brt analysis elith et al 2008 in addition tls derived structural variables offered an opportunity to quantify the three dimensional traits of forest structures more precisely which aids in the accuracy of the study roth et al 2007 although reliable results were obtained the uncertainty of brt analysis still existed as raindrop size distribution levia et al 2017 and raindrop volume hall 2003 were recognized as significantly influencing variables on ri and they were not included in this study zabret and šraj 2021 also observed that the introduction of variables related to rainfall microstructure i e raindrop diameter raindrop velocity the number of raindrops changed the relative influence of other meteorological variables therefore more variables are expected to be included in brt analysis to eliminate some of the uncertainty additionally multiple models are suggested to be used simultaneously in order to obtain a detailed analysis on how rainfall is intercepted by forest canopies zabret et al 2018 zabret and šraj 2021 5 conclusions the average values of rainfall interception ri amount for light rainfall events lr middle rainfall events mr and heavy rainfall events hr were 2 0 mm 3 5 mm and 6 6 mm respectively the average values of ri proportion for lr mr and hr were 74 8 20 2 17 1 respectively the ri amount of hr was significantly higher than those of mr and lr and the ri amount of mr was significantly higher than that of lr contrary to ri amount the ri proportion of hr was significantly lower than those of mr and lr and the ri proportion of mr was significantly lower than that of lr for all rainfall amount levels together the ri amount was governed by rainfall amount followed by canopy interception index cii and humidity whereas the ri proportion was governed by cii followed by rainfall amount humidity and average canopy height ach for each rainfall amount level alone the rainfall amount was the most influential variable on ri amount regardless of rainfall amount levels however the most influential variable on the ri proportion was different across rainfall amount levels for lr and mr the most influential variable was cii and for hr it was humidity in addition a variety of influential variables such as rainfall intensity and wind speed intricately and complexly affected ri amount and ri proportion for all rainfall amount levels together as well as for each rainfall amount level alone although reliable accuracies of influence variables on the ri are obtained the uncertainty still exists to answer the fundamental question of how rainfall is intercepted by forest canopies more influential variables should be included also multiple models are suggested to be built simultaneously credit authorship contribution

2673,rainfall interception ri by forest canopy is an important part of the ecohydrology cycle influenced by rainfall characteristics weather conditions forest structures and their interactions rainfall events with different amounts are likely to change the ways that rainfall interacts with forest canopies and consequently vary the effects of influential variables on ri markedly thus analyzing the influential variables on ri separately according to rainfall amounts need further attention in this study rainfall partitioning was measured in 60 plots of four forest types during june to september from 2017 to 2019 weather conditions were obtained from four weather stations spatially representing all the study plots detailed canopy structural variables were retrieved from the terrestrial laser scanning then boosted regression trees brt analyses were performed to evaluate the contributing variables of ri at different rainfall amounts as a result a total of 77 rainfall events were measured and 43 19 and 15 events were classified as light rainfall events lr gross rainfall 10 mm middle rainfall events mr 10 mm gross rainfall 25 mm and heavy rainfall events hr gross rainfall 25 mm the average values of ri amounts the difference between gross rainfall and the sum of throughfall and stemflow for lr mr and lr were 2 0 mm 3 5 mm and 6 6 mm respectively the average ri proportions the proportion of ri amount to gross rainfall for lr mr and hr were 74 8 20 2 and 17 1 respectively both ri amount and ri proportion were significantly different among the rainfall amount levels lr mr and hr brt results showed that for all rainfall amount levels together ri amount was governed by rainfall amount followed by canopy interception index cii and humidity whereas ri proportion was most influenced by cii followed by rainfall amount humidity and average canopy height ach as expected for a given rainfall amount level rainfall amount was the most influential variable on ri amount naturally the most influential variable on ri proportion varied with rainfall amount levels for lr and mr the most influential variables were cii while it was humidity for hr furthermore a variety of significant variables with the relative influence value higher than the averaged value such as rainfall intensity wind speed and ach intricately and complexly affected ri amount and proportion at each rainfall amount level in addition the rainfall amount exerted a stepwise positive correlation with ri amount cii showed a stepwise positive and humidity a negative influence on ri proportion respectively a comprehensive understanding of the influence variable on ri at distinct rainfall amount levels provides valuable insights into how forest canopies intercept rainfall and

boosted regression trees terrestrial laser scanning temperate forest data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rainfall interception ri is the rainfall retained in the canopy and then evaporates back into the atmosphere generally ri varies greatly at the forest stand with ri amount the difference with gross rainfall and the sum of throughfall and stemflow ranging from 1 8 mm to 6 5 mm and ri proportion the proportion of ri amount to gross rainfall ranging from 10 to 50 in temperate forests barbier et al 2009 he et al 2014 ri has various ecological and hydrological functions such as reducing the kinetic energy of rainfall drops goebes et al 2015 levia et al 2017 mitigating soil erosion nanko et al 2016a seitz et al 2017 regulating the water storage in litter and soil layers nanko et al 2010 uhlenbrook 2006 influencing chemical deposition kristensen et al 2004 zhu et al 2018 total evaporation savenije 2004 and global water supply murray 2014 because of its important role it is essential to evaluate the influential variables on ri ri varies considerably for forest stands as a function of forest structures e g tree height basal area surface area of leaf branch and stem and meteorological variables meteorological variables are further divided into two groups in studies del campo et al 2018 li et al 2016a including rainfall characteristics e g rainfall amount rainfall intensity rainfall duration and meteorological conditions e g wind speed temperature humidity however up to now there is no consensus on the effects of variables on ri for example some studies showed that ri increased with the increase of wind speed reid and lewis 2009 staelens et al 2008 this was because the higher wind speed raised the evaporation rate according to the penman monteith equation however other studies suggested that higher wind speed resulted in lower ri iida et al 2017 van stan et al 2014 this could be explained by an assumption that wind shook the canopy causing splash and channeling more rainfall into throughfall another example the raindrop diameter was also regarded as either increasing or decreasing ri calder 1996a zabret et al 2018 the conflicting information may be because that the three groups of influential variables are interdependent to create a complete picture of effects of different variables on ri it is essential to analyse these variables together generally the effect of variables on ri are different between the deciduous and coniferous tree species li et al 2016a zabret et al 2018 between the leafed and leafless periods nanko et al 2016b tanaka et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 between the young and old trees pypker et al 2005 between general weather conditions zabret and šraj 2021 between canopy phenologies tanaka et al 2015 and between the diverse tree species del campo et al 2018 li et al 2016a van stan et al 2014 therefore in order to analyze the effects of variables on ri considering the species or morphologies of trees the relationships between influential variables and ri are studied separately according to the tree characters mentioned above additionally rainfall amount is reported as the most important variable that influences ri in many studies staelens et al 2008 zabret and šraj 2019 rainfall events with different amounts vary the effects that rainfall interacts with forest canopy mali et al 2020 park and cameron 2008 siles et al 2010 for example forest canopy redistributes rainfall and rainfall simultaneously changes the inclination of leaves and branches and consequently the changed forest canopy directly influences canopy storage capacity fathizadeh et al 2017 the changed forest canopy together with weather conditions may also regulate the rate or amount of evaporation deguchi et al 2006 thus rainfall events with different amounts are likely to vary the effect of influential variables on ri markedly however analyzing the influential variables on ri separately according to rainfall amounts has been less investigated in the context of all three group variables in addition previous ri studies involved forest stands and individual mature trees where many structure characteristics could not be accurately measured due to the high three dimensional spatial variability herwitz and slye 1995 roth et al 2007 yu et al 2020 to accurately investigate the relationship between ri and structural variables the detailed structural variables are collected from shrubs yuan et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 or small trees li et al 2016a in the field yuan et al 2016 or laboratory li et al 2016a however whether the relationships are applicable to forest stand in the field remains unclear terrestrial laser scanning tls is a state of the art active remote sensing technology which can offer an opportunity to rapidly and accurately describe the three dimensional forest structures on forest stand liang et al 2016 thus the tls derived structure variables may allow a reliable relationship between ri and forest structure for example yu et al 2020 reported that the tls derived canopy interception index cii showed a stronger performance to ri than other structural variables meanwhile the tls derived structure variables such as lai pai cii have not yet been fully explored in the analysis of the relationships between ri and forest canopies hence four forest types including korean pine pinus koraiensis plantation forest kpf larch larix spp plantation forest lpf mixed broadleaved forest mbf and mongolian oak quercus mongolica forest mof are common in northeastern china where water scarcity has become an increasing threat to sustainable development and where large scale re forestation efforts are altering rainfall distribution and regional water budgets with the aid of tls technology to investigate forest structures this study aimed to analyze rainfall characteristics meteorological conditions and forest structures together and to identify the most influential variables on ri among different levels of rainfall amounts the main objectives of this study were as follows 1 to compare ri amount the difference of gross rainfall and the sum of throughfall and stemflow and ri proportion the proportion of ri amount to gross rainfall among different rainfall amount levels 2 to understand the influences of rainfall characteristics meteorological conditions and forest structures on ri at all rainfall events 3 to explore the influential variables on ri separately according to rainfall amount levels the comprehensive combination of three groups of variables especially the detailed structural variables extracted from the tls will draw more robust conclusions on influential variables on ri the exploration of the influence variables on ri at distinct rainfall amount levels can provide insights that the effect ways of influence variables on ri may be different among rainfall amount levels 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was carried out in qingyuan forest cern chinese ecosystem research network a permanent field research site established by the chinese academy of sciences in northeast china 41 51 n 124 54 e fig 1 the study area has a continental monsoon climate with the mean annual temperature ranging from 3 9 to 5 4 the average frost free period is 130 days the soil type is typical brown soil with the soil depth of 30 60 cm yang and zhu 2015 annual precipitation including rainfall and snow ranges from 700 to 850 mm and annual rainfall is from 450 to 650 mm nearly 70 of which falls in summer yu et al 2020 the study area is located in the headwater of protection zone where forests provide protection of water regulation and supply for the cities downstream the protection zone is uninhabited currently natural secondary stands accompanying with mosaic plantations form the typical temperate secondary forest ecosystems there the dominant tree species include betula platyphylla fraxinus mandshurica manchurian walnut populus davidiana quercus mongolica larix spp and pinus koraiensis zhu et al 2018 korean pine pinus koraiensis plantation forest kpf larch larix spp plantation forest lpf mixed broadleaved forest mbf and mongolian oak quercus mongolica forest mof were selected in the study area to represent typical natural forests and plantation forests as well as typical broadleaved and coniferous forests for each forest type four to six study sites were set with a dimension of 30 20 m fig 1 in the middle locations of the slope and the slope degrees ranged from 20 to 35 there are differences in structural variables i e basal area average canopy height and canopy cover among the study sites and the detailed comparison can be seen from yu et al 2020 the complex forest structures of study sites are subdivided into more homogeneous units therefore for each site three plots with a dimension of 6 6 m three tree units in each plot at least andré et al 2008 were chosen to measure ri and structural variables 2 2 measurement of gross rainfall throughfall and stemflow the gross rainfall throughfall and stemflow were measured during july to september growing and rainy season in 2017 2018 and 2019 with the tipping bucket rain gauge witu sf automatic precipitation sensors weitu inc shenyang liaoning china the rain gauge automatically records rainfall with an interval of 30 min the minimum measure value was 0 2 mm two sample sites at an open area were selected to measure gross rainfall ensuring that all the experiment sites within a distance of 1 000 m to either of the center site fig 1 to ensure that the canopy would dry out the dynamics of water intercepted in canopy were observed at the fields the rainfall events were separated by an interval of 8 h in windy weather wind speed 1 5 m s or 12 h in calm weather wind speed 1 5 m s based on observation he et al 2014 the detailed descriptions of the gross rainfall throughfall and stemflow measurements can be found from yu et al 2020 because inflow into the bucket continues during tipping the tipping bucket rain gauge cannot measure the inflow during tripping leading an underestimation of the actual inflow referring to the equations showing relationships between the scaled inflow rate and the actual volume of a single tip suggested by iida et al 2012 the systematic underestimations of gross rainfall throughfall and stemflow by the rain gauge were corrected in this study ri was expressed as 1 ri amount mm and 2 ri proportion the ri amount was calculated as the difference between gross rainfall and the sum of throughfall and stemflow and the ri proportion was calculated as a proportion of the ri amount when compared with gross rainfall 2 3 measurement of meteorological conditions temperature humidity wind speed and vapor pressure deficit were reported as meteorological conditions influencing ri tanaka et al 2015 nanko et al 2016a meteorological conditions mentioned above were measured from four meteorological stations including the qingyuan forest cern meteorological station i e qyf ms maws310 vaisala finland and the multi tower platforms of qingyuan forest cern meteorological stations closed path eddy covariance 310 campbell scientific inc usa atmospheric profile 200 campbell scientific inc usa i e mbf tower platform mbf tp mof tower platform mof tp and lpf tower platform lpf tp all the experiment sites were sited within a distance of 1000 m to any of the four meteorological stations consistent with the measurement time of rainfall the meteorological conditions from qyf ms were measured ranging from july to september in 2017 2018 and 2019 nevertheless the meteorological conditions of mbf tp mof tp and lpf tp were only measured from july to september in 2019 all data were measured automatically with an interval of one hour 2 4 estimation of forest structural variables 2 4 1 tls data collection and preprocessing tls point clouds the data collected by tls with a large amount of y z coordinates were collected with a pentax s 3180 v terrestrial laser scanner tiasahi japan mounted on a tripod during the leaf on 13th to 22th april and leaf off 20th to 25th august seasons in 2017 for each site fig 2 a multi location scanning was used to collect the complete information of study sites with the leaf on of 10 and the leaf off of 6 respectively liang et al 2016 6 referencing targets with high reflectance were set up in each site to register the collected tls point clouds from different scans leaf on and leaf off seasons of each site were separately registered with the iterative closest point algorithm besl and mckay 1992 the final registration errors of all sites were lower than 7 mm fig 2 b the registered data fig 2 b were further processed to generate normalized point clouds that excluded the effect of topography during the calculation of y coordinates height of point clouds fig 2 e first the registered data of leaf on and leaf off seasons were separately merged in cloudcompare software open source software version 2 6 1 and then the point clouds of the site were clipped from the merged point clouds fig 2 c second in order to improve the accuracy of the subsequent data processing noise point clouds were removed with statistical outlier removal algorithm fig 2 c third filtering was processed in the terrasolid s terrascan software terrasolid ltd helsinki finland version 5 011 classifying the point clouds into ground and non ground point clouds the point clouds of vegetation aboveground fig 2 d fourthly a digital elevation model dem was extracted from the ground point clouds with the ordinary kriging method and then the point clouds were normalized based on the non ground point clouds and dem fig 2 e finally point clouds of the three plots were clipped from each site fig 2 f 2 4 2 structural variables extraction one dimensional variables average canopy height ach two dimensional variables basal area ba leaf area index lai plant area index pai and three dimensional variables optical stratification porosity osp canopy interception index cii cubic density cd related to ri were extracted from the normalized tls point clouds of each plot ach was retrieved from the normalized leaf on point clouds the plot was first divided into grid cells with a size of 3 m 3 m that was approximately equal to the mean projected canopy area of a tree the stand density was nearly 1000 trees per ha then ach was calculated by the average value of the maximum z values of the grid cells ba was calculated from dbh diameter at breast height that was retrieved from the point clouds with a height between 1 25 and 1 35 m above the ground within this slice all circular point clusters were detected with dbscan density based spatial clustering of applications with noise algorithm tao et al 2015 and then the circle fitting algorithm pueschel et al 2013 was used to calculate the diameters of circles i e dbh of trees osp represents the proportion of sky hemisphere not obscured by tree elements downward to a horizontal plane at a given height inside a forest stand zhu et al 2003 in this study the point clouds were first arranged in x y grids of which the dimension was determined by the mean minimum distance li et al 2016b the mean minimum distance was calculated as follows first for a given point in point clouds its nearest neighboring point was searched and the distance from the point to the nearest point was identified as the minimum distance then the minimum distances of all points were averaged as mean minimum distance based on the point clouds arranged in x y grids those grids with at least one point represented occupied or else represented non occupied osp was calculated as a ratio i e the number of non occupied cells to the number of all cells osp was calculated at 1 5 ach 2 5 ach 3 5 ach and 4 5 ach corresponding to the calculated height the structure variables were named as osph 5 osp2h 5 osp3h 5 osp4h 5 cd is defined as the ratio of vegetation volume to whole canopy value zhou et al 2002 in this study the point clouds were first arranged in x y z voxels 3d space composed of adjacent cubic cells of specific dimension of which the dimension was also determined by the mean minimum distance li et al 2016b and thus those voxels with at least one point represented occupied or else represented non occupied cd was calculated as a ratio i e the number of occupied voxels to the number of all voxels the variables used to describe surface areas including lai pai and cii were extracted based on the wood leaf separation that aimed to retrieve the leaf branch and stem point clouds respectively the detailed descriptions of wood leaf separation as well as lai pai and cii calculation can be found in yu et al 2020 2 5 statistical analysis referring to the rainfall amount levels classification of china meteorological administration and related researches carlyle moses and schooling 2015 siles et al 2010 rainfall events were classified into three levels based on rainfall amount i e light rainfall events lr gross rainfall 10 mm middle rainfall events mr 10 mm gross rainfall 25 mm and heavy rainfall events hr gross rainfall 25 mm one way anova and tukey s hsd test were applied to distinguish the effects of rainfall amount levels i e lr mr and hr on ri amount and ri proportion using the multcomp hothorn et al 2021 package in r software r core team 2020 boosted regression trees brt have gained popularity in recent studies of influence variables on ri del campo et al 2018 nanko et al 2016b tanaka et al 2017 zabret et al 2018 in this study brt models were performed separately at all rainfall events and at part rainfall events the part rainfall events corresponded to three rainfall amount levels i e lr mr and hr the response variables were ri amount and ri proportion for the four rainfall groups the predictor variables were rainfall characteristics i e rainfall amount rainfall intensity and rainfall duration meteorological conditions i e temperature humidity wind speed and vapor pressure deficit structural variables i e ach ba osph 5 osp2h 5 osp3h 5 osp4h 5 lai pai cii and cd to avoid potential collinearity r 0 6 between the structural variables following the data exploration protocol of zuur et al 2010 the pairwise person correlation coefficient was calculated with the hmisc harrell and dupont 2020 package in r software due to the problems of automatic tipping bucket rain gauge as well as the incomplete measurement of meteorological conditions a total of 2375 records were collected for all rainfall events among which 1299 records for lr 530 records for mr and 546 records for hr brt combines the strengths of two algorithms regression trees models that relate a response to their predictors and boosted model an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance introducing some randomness into a boosted model usually improves accuracy and reduces overfitting elith et al 2008 in this study brt was fitted using a gaussian response type with a learning rate the rate of shrinking the contribution of each simple model to brt of 0 005 a tree complexity the number of nodes in a tree of 4 a bag fraction the proportion of data to be selected for model building of 0 75 relative influence value riv of predictor variable on the response variable was computed based on the number of times that the variable was selected for splitting riv was weighted by the squared improvement to model as a result of each split and averaged over all trees elith et al 2008 riv of each variable was scaled so that the sum added to 100 with higher value indicating stronger influence on the response variable as a threshold value indicating the significant influence of the variables on ri a value of 9 1 100 divided by 11 the number of variables was set zabret et al 2018 the significant influential variables were plotted with partial dependence plots pdp that showed the individual effect of each predictor on ri brt models were performed in r software with package gbm ridgeway 2020 3 results 3 1 influential variables of ri a total of 77 rainfall events were recorded 24 rainfall events in 2017 25 rainfall events in 2018 and 28 rainfall events in 2019 respectively 43 19 and 15 rainfall events were classified as light rainfall events lr gross rainfall 10 mm middle rainfall events mr 10 mm gross rainfall 25 mm and heavy rainfall events hr gross rainfall 25 mm as shown in fig 3 the total rainfall amount was 1083 3 mm and the single rainfall amount ranged from 0 2 to 75 9 mm with an average value of 14 1 mm sd 15 8 mm rainfall duration ranged from 0 2 h to 31 h with an averaged value of 5 4 h sd 5 8 h based on rainfall amount and rainfall duration rainfall intensity was calculated as ranging from 0 1 mm h 1 to 12 5 mm h 1 with an average value of 2 6 mm h 1 sd 2 5 mm h 1 meteorological variables of study plots during each rainfall event were calculated from the four meteorological stations respectively based on the average values of meteorological variables per rainfall event the meteorological variables of four meteorological stations were compared table 1 due to the opposite aspects between mbf tp and mof tp the humidity of mbf tp 86 5 9 8 was significantly higher than that of mof tp 80 2 10 6 however except for humidity the other three meteorological conditions showed no statistical differences among the meteorological stations of mbf tp mof tp and lpf tp table 1 compared with the other three meteorological stations qyf ms had a higher humidity and wind speed lower vapor pressure deficit p 0 05 structural variables of study plots showed large variations table 2 the ach of lpf was higher than the other forest types kpf showed the highest ba among the four forest types while mof had the highest cd for each forest type osp steadily increased with the increasing height inside the forest stand however for each height inside the forest stand the largest osp was found in different forest types as expected the coniferous forests had higher surface area related parameters lai pai and cii than broadleaved forests table 2 to avoid potential collinearity in brt analysis the pairwise pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between the structural variables fig s1 based on the correlation coefficient and the set value r 0 6 the structural variables were carefully chosen and the retained structural variables were ach osp3h 5 cii and cd 3 2 ri amount and ri proportion at different rainfall amount levels for all rainfall events ri amount ranged from 0 3 mm to 13 0 mm with an average value of 3 3 mm sd 2 1 mm while ri proportion ranged from 6 3 to 100 with an average value of 38 7 sd 32 3 to account for the effect of rainfall amount on ri ri amount and ri proportion were calculated in three rainfall amount levels fig 4 the average values of ri amount for lr mr and hr were 2 0 mm 3 5 mm and 6 6 mm respectively the ri amount of hr was significantly higher than those of mr and lr p 0 01 and the ri amount of mr was significantly higher than that of lr p 0 01 the average values of ri proportion for lr mr and hr were 74 8 20 2 17 1 respectively contrary to ri amount the ri proportion of hr was significantly lower than those of mr and lr p 0 01 and the ri proportion of mr was significantly lower than that of lr p 0 01 3 3 influential variables on ri amount and proportion for all rainfall events together brt analysis showed that ri amount was most influenced by rainfall amount with 55 7 of relative influence value riv fig 5 a the second and third influential variables were cii and humidity with 15 9 and 12 1 of riv fig 5 a the rivs of other influential variables were less than the threshold value of 9 9 fig 5 a partial dependence plots pdp showed that rainfall amount ranging from 0 mm to 76 mm exerted a staged positive correlation with ri amount fig 6 additionally ri amount appeared to increase sharply with cii ranging from 5 to 10 whereas increased slowly as long as cii greater than 10 fig 6 contrary to rainfall amount and cii humidity exerted a stepwise negative influence on ri amount fig 6 when classifying all the influential variables into three groups i e rainfall characteristics meteorological conditions and forest structures ri amount was mostly governed by rainfall characteristics with 62 2 of riv table 3 whereas forest structures and meteorological conditions were the second and third governing variables with 23 3 and 14 6 of riv table 3 in contrast the ri proportion was most influenced by cii 31 4 of riv followed in descending order by rainfall amount humidity and ach 25 7 14 3 and 10 4 of riv respectively while the other variables were less than the threshold value fig 5 b pdp indicated that the ri proportion increased sharply with cii ranging from 5 to 10 whereas increased slowly as cii greater than 10 fig 6 which is similar to the pdp of the ri amount with cii also a staged positive impact of ach on the ri proportion was found fig 6 on the contrary rainfall amount and humidity exerted negative influences on the ri proportion fig 6 the ri proportion decreased sharply with rainfall amount increasing from 0 mm to 17 mm and then decreased slowly as rainfall amount larger than 17 mm fig 6 the ri proportion decreased sharply with humidity higher than 90 fig 6 when classifying all the influential variables into three groups the ri proportion was most affected by forest structures 44 6 of riv while rainfall characteristics and meteorological conditions 33 and 22 4 of riv respectively were the second and third effected variables table 3 3 4 influential variables on ri amount and proportion at each rainfall amount level analyzing influential factors on ri amount and ri proportion at each rainfall amount level showed that a variety of variables intricately and complexly affected ri fig 7 fig s2 and table 3 rainfall amount exerted an overwhelming influence on ri amount in lr mr and hr levels with 73 6 44 8 and 35 3 of riv respectively fig 7 a b c along with the reduction of rainfall amount riv riv of cii and ach showed an obvious gain at the mr level while riv of humidity and wind speed showed an obvious gain at the hr level fig 7 a b c at the mr level pdp showed that cii and ach exerted a staged positive correlation with ri amount fig s2 at the hr level humidity exhibited a stepwise negative correlation with ri amount fig s2 nevertheless the ri amount increased up to wind speed of 2 1 m s 1 and then decreased with wind speed increasing fig s2 when classifying all the influential variables into three groups ri amounts of lr mr and hr were all most affected by rainfall characteristics 87 5 55 2 and 42 9 of riv respectively table 3 the effects of forest structures and meteorological conditions at the lr level 7 9 and 4 7 of riv respectively were weaker table 3 compared to the lr level the effect of forest structures at the mr level 32 4 of riv increased table 3 and the effect of meteorological conditions at the hr level 36 8 of riv also increased obviously table 3 in contrast cii showed an overwhelming influence on ri proportion at the lr and mr levels 34 and 33 5 of riv while humidity was the most influential variable on ri proportion at the hr level 34 9 of riv it was worth noting that rainfall amount and rainfall intensity were significantly influential variables for ri proportion at all rainfall amount levels ach was a significant influential variable at the lr and hr levels while wind speed was a significant influential variable at the mr and hr levels when classifying all the influential variables into three groups the ri proportions of lr and mr were most affected by forest structures 56 3 and 47 9 of riv respectively whereas the ri proportion of hr was most influenced by meteorological conditions 46 8 of riv 4 discussion 4 1 ri amount and ri proportion at different rainfall amount levels when combining all rainfall events together the average value of the ri amount ranges from 1 8 mm to 6 5 mm while the average value of the ri proportion ranges from 10 to 50 in temperate forests he et al 2014 iida et al 2017 liu et al 2018 in this study the average values of ri amount and ri proportion were respectively 3 3 mm and 38 7 and the values were within the range of previous studies however when the ri amount and ri proportion were calculated among the three rainfall amount levels i e lr mr and hr ri amount value was largest in hr 6 6 mm followed in descending order by mr 3 5 mm and lr 2 0 mm while the ri proportion showed the opposite order i e largest in lr 74 8 followed by mr 20 2 and hr 17 1 the values of ri amount in hr and ri proportion in lr were not in the above intervals this may be partly because the rainfall events with different amounts rainfall amount levels cause a variation of the interaction between rainfall and forest canopies mali et al 2020 park and cameron 2008 siles et al 2010 thus analyzing the influential variables on ri separately according to rainfall amount need further attention in a similar study by selecting the different threshold values of rainfall amount zabret and šraj 2019 investigated the influence of rain event characteristics on ri the methods of threshold value selection based on the multiple correspondence analysis and sensitivity analysis were really useful for evaluating the influential variable on ri 4 2 influential variables on ri amount and proportion rainfall amount was recognized as the most influential variable on ri amount whether for all rainfall events together or for each rainfall amount level alone fig 5 fig 7 as previously reported by other studies šraj et al 2008 staelens et al 2008 zabret and šraj 2019 although the ri amount is known to increase with rainfall amount the relationship types are described as linear fathizadeh et al 2017 power sun et al 2018 or exponential crockford and richardson 2000 in this study rainfall amount exerted a staged positive correlation with ri amount fig 6 this may be the result of overwhelming influences of rainfall amount and intricate effects of other variables on ri siles et al 2010 zabret and šraj 2021 ri proportion was most influenced by cii for all rainfall events together as well as for lr and mr fig 5 and fig 7 as a forest descriptor cii may be the first index defined to predict ri specially the surface areas and water storage capacities of all tree components leaf branch and stem are considered in the definition of cii yu et al 2020 in addition terrestrial laser scanning tls provides an accurate calculation of cii by avoiding the saturation effect garcía et al 2015 therefore the riv of cii was found higher than that of other structural variables fig 5 similarly the performance of cii to predict ri was also found better than that of other structural variables yu et al 2020 in the case of ri proportion in hr humidity was the dominant variable fig 7 exerting a stepwise negative influence on ri proportion fig s2 zabret et al 2018 reported that humidity was one of the most influential variables on rainfall partitioning for birch trees which was partially supported by this study lower humidity contributes to larger quantities of water retained by tree components leaf branch and stem and thus increase the canopy storage capacity levia and germer 2015 yu et al 2020 in addition compared with lr and mr humidity showed the largest riv in hr whether for ri amount or ri proportion fig 7 this may be because the rainfall amount in hr is more feasible to induce the tree components to get the maximum storage capacities levia and germer 2015 rainfall intensity as an important influencing variable was recognized several times by both brt models of ri amount and ri proportion fig 7 ri may decrease with higher rainfall intensity which is probably due to the consequence of high rainfall intensity creating splash and channeling of more rainfall into throughfall herwitz 1987 kermavnar and vilhar 2017 toba and ohta 2005 this phenomenon is expecially recongnized for trees with smoother bark surfaces and more flexible leaves zabret and šraj 2021 also other studies reported that the maximum canopy storage and ri decreased with the increasing of drop volume and drop diameter levia et al 2017 zabret et al 2018 those results are partially supported in this study by the pdp of rainfall intensity for ri amount and ri proportion the pdp of rainfall intensity showed ri amount of mr and hr decreased with rainfall intensity increasing as well as the ri proportion of lr mr and hr fig s2 whereas the ri amount of lr exerted a positive correlation with rainfall intensity 1 6 mm h 1 fig s2 this phenomenon was supported by calder et al 1996b who reported that ri would be higher for samller raindrop diameters ach was also recognized as an influencing variable several times by both brt models of ri amount and ri proportion fig 7 compared with tree height ach calculated based on tls point clouds quantifies the canopy height of forest plot more precisely furthermore ach is an efficient index for accurately predicting ri yu et al 2020 ach exerted a positive correlation with ri fig s2 this because that higher ach is probably to induce larger surface areas of tree components and thus increase canopy storage capacities liu 1998 moreover higher ach contributes to a higher canopy roughness and a more effective energy exchange with the atmosphere which results in higher ri dietz et al 2006 the noticeable influence of wind speed on ri amount for hr was confirmed as well as on ri proportion for mr fig 7 ri amount and ri proportion increased with wind speed increasing with threshold values of 1 3 m s 1 and 2 2 m s 1 respectively fig s2 and then exerted a negative correlation with wind speed according to the penman monteith equation wind speed increases the evaporation rate and that increases ri reid and lewis 2009 however higher wind speed may shake the canopy causing the loss of the intercepted rainfall and then decreases ri nanko et al 2006 van stan et al 2014 additionally distinct to noticeable influences on ri amount for hr and ri proportion for mr wind speed in other models showed lower riv that is in accordance with the studies that observed the negligible influence of wind speed on ri zabret et al 2018 4 3 the accuracy and uncertainty of brt analyses data on a total of 77 rainfall events and their canopy partitioning data were measured and recorded from 60 study plots in four forest types in temperate forests during june to september from 2017 to 2019 as a result more than 2000 records 1299 records for lr 530 records for mr and 546 records for hr were collected for brt models the adequate records provided highly reliable accuracy for brt analysis elith et al 2008 in addition tls derived structural variables offered an opportunity to quantify the three dimensional traits of forest structures more precisely which aids in the accuracy of the study roth et al 2007 although reliable results were obtained the uncertainty of brt analysis still existed as raindrop size distribution levia et al 2017 and raindrop volume hall 2003 were recognized as significantly influencing variables on ri and they were not included in this study zabret and šraj 2021 also observed that the introduction of variables related to rainfall microstructure i e raindrop diameter raindrop velocity the number of raindrops changed the relative influence of other meteorological variables therefore more variables are expected to be included in brt analysis to eliminate some of the uncertainty additionally multiple models are suggested to be used simultaneously in order to obtain a detailed analysis on how rainfall is intercepted by forest canopies zabret et al 2018 zabret and šraj 2021 5 conclusions the average values of rainfall interception ri amount for light rainfall events lr middle rainfall events mr and heavy rainfall events hr were 2 0 mm 3 5 mm and 6 6 mm respectively the average values of ri proportion for lr mr and hr were 74 8 20 2 17 1 respectively the ri amount of hr was significantly higher than those of mr and lr and the ri amount of mr was significantly higher than that of lr contrary to ri amount the ri proportion of hr was significantly lower than those of mr and lr and the ri proportion of mr was significantly lower than that of lr for all rainfall amount levels together the ri amount was governed by rainfall amount followed by canopy interception index cii and humidity whereas the ri proportion was governed by cii followed by rainfall amount humidity and average canopy height ach for each rainfall amount level alone the rainfall amount was the most influential variable on ri amount regardless of rainfall amount levels however the most influential variable on the ri proportion was different across rainfall amount levels for lr and mr the most influential variable was cii and for hr it was humidity in addition a variety of influential variables such as rainfall intensity and wind speed intricately and complexly affected ri amount and ri proportion for all rainfall amount levels together as well as for each rainfall amount level alone although reliable accuracies of influence variables on the ri are obtained the uncertainty still exists to answer the fundamental question of how rainfall is intercepted by forest canopies more influential variables should be included also multiple models are suggested to be built simultaneously credit authorship contribution

2674,in this study we proposed a new integrated remote sensing drought monitoring indices i e multiple remote sensing drought index integrated by principal component analysis psdi multiple remote sensing drought index integrated by multiple linear regression mrsdi and multiple remote sensing drought index integrated by gradient boosting method gbmdi based on the precipitation condition index pci temperature condition index tci vegetation condition index vci and soil moisture condition index smci the monitoring performance of psdi mrsdi and gbmdi was compared and verified based on the real world observed droughts during 2002 to 2016 we also evidenced drought monitoring performance of the psdi mrsdi and gbmdi by comparison between psdi mrsdi gbmdi and spei spi and pdsi based on the in situ observed meteorological data we found that the spatiotemporal characteristics of droughts monitored by the psdi mrsdi and gbmdi were generally in good agreement with those by the spi and spei the gbmdi performs better than psdi and mrsdi in describing drought processes and spatial patterns of droughts of different drought intensities comparison between the real world observed drought affected croplands and those monitored by psdi mrsdi and gbmdi indicated better drought monitoring performance of gbmdi than psdi and mrsdi in monitoring droughts across widespread drought affected regions besides the trend of gbmdi is in good agreement with standardized crop yield therefore gbmdi should be the first choice in drought monitoring practice the gbmdi developed in this study can help to provide an alternative drought monitoring index for large scale drought monitoring across china and also in other regions of the globe keywords remote sensing drought monitoring multiple linear regression principle component analysis gradient boosting method data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is of stochastic nature having devastating impacts on human society and eco environment zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017b thus drought is often considered as one of the costliest and also less understood natural hazards of the world salinger et al 2000 zargar et al 2011 coumou and rahmstorf 2012 zhang et al 2018a drought induced global economic losses were estimated to be as high as 6 to 8 billion us dollars each year being far more than other meteorological disasters wilhite 2000 hence how to enhance human mitigation to droughts is crucial for sustainable development of human society and also for ecological conservation while monitoring of droughts is the first step into human mitigation and related management of drought hazards yan et al 2018 hence development and application of effective and efficient drought indices mean much for prediction and management of drought hazards e g sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a there stands a range of drought indices such as standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010b and palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 spi considers precipitation changes only without consideration of impacts of other factors on occurrence of droughts such as air temperature wind speed evapotranspiration and soil moisture um et al 2018 the pdsi is widely used to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of drought and drought forecasting liu et al 2013 but it may have some limitations in addressing short term droughts and describing the effect of droughts on natural systems guttman 1998 vicente serrano et al 2010a the spei was defined by water deficiency or water surpluses based on the difference between evapotranspiration and precipitation it is a multi scalar drought index for quantifying the onset duration and magnitude of drought zhang et al 2018a therefore spei has been widely used in drought monitoring practice because it is better than spi in calculating water balance mathematically and is better than pdsi in monitoring short term droughts hao et al 2015 hao and singh 2015 liu et al 2018 um et al 2018 wang et al 2015 besides all these drought indices are computed based on in situ observed meteorological variables the in situ observations are comparatively accurate but cannot describe areal variations of meteorological variables sun et al 2017 generally spatial patterns of droughts based on in situ observations were analyzed using spatial interpolation techniques however spatial interpolations using different methods usually introduce extra uncertainties in drought monitoring results in spatial sense swain et al 2011 park et al 2016 remote sensing data has the advantage of providing near real time data at various spatial and temporal scales therefore it has been widely used in drought monitoring in recent years aghakouchak et al 2015 guo et al 2019 actually remote sensing data has been widely used in drought monitoring practice such as normalized differential vegetation index ndvi data extracted from advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr were used to analyze impacts of droughts on vegetation conditions tucker 1979 in recent years microwave remote sensing data have also been widely used in drought monitoring such as tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr e essential climate variable soil moisture ecv sm jia et al 2015 carrão et al 2015 park et al 2016 liu et al 2017 besides a range of drought monitoring indices were proposed and developed based on remote sensing data such as vegetation condition index vci kogan 1995b temperature condition index tci kogan 1995a standardized soil moisture index ssi aghakouchak 2014 soil moisture condition index smci zhang and jia 2013 normalized difference water index ndwi gao 1996 and the normalized multi band drought index nmdi wang and qu 2007 however these drought indices using single hydrometeorological variable only can monitor drought through certain drought related variables e g vegetation land surface temperature soil moisture and cannot to capture drought information reliably tian et al 2018 guo et al 2019 in recent years development of integrated drought monitoring index considering multiple factors influencing occurrence of droughts has aroused growing human concerns with focus on agricultural drought monitoring sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a hao et al 2015 the vegetation health index vhi kogan 1995a kogan 1995b was developed by combining vci and tci however using vhi to monitor drought condition has to be undertaken with caution in high latitude regions karnieli et al 2006 rhee et al 2010 combined three drought indices i e tci pci precipitation condition index vci and proposed the scaled drought condition index sdci for agricultural drought monitoring zhang and jia 2013 developed the microwave integrated drought index midi via combination of tci pci and smci with aim to monitor short term meteorological droughts however the sdci and the midi were established for a specific location and the combination method require multiple trials to determine weights to build the model shen et al 2019 du et al 2013 developed the synthesized drought index sdi using the principle component analysis pca method based on vci tci and pci to monitor agricultural droughts across the shandong province china however the principal component analysis may lose useful drought information during the dimension reducing process hao et al 2015 thus hao et al 2015 proposed the optimized meteorological drought index omdi and the optimized vegetation drought index ovdi with vci tci pci and smci using the constrained optimization method for the drought monitoring practice across the southwestern china the establishment of ovdi relies too much on the correlation with spei and may not be able to make full use of the characteristic information of the single drought indices recent years witnessed progress in development of integrated drought monitoring indices and in drought monitoring practices azmi and rüdiger 2018 for example azmi et al 2016 developed a data fusion based drought index and analyzed for three different locations of varying land use and climate regimes in australia linear regression is a simple and easy to implement method sun et al 2017 used soil moisture as the dependent variable and developed the integrated remote sensing drought monitoring index irsdi using a multiple linear regressive method most researches mainly focused on drought monitoring practice at regional scale using remotely sensed datasets these indices such as sdci and midi were developed under a narrow range of environmental conditions and their relatively poor performance is significant when these indices were applied for drought monitoring in different climate regions jiao et al 2019 a big challenge for these drought indices in monitoring of different drought conditions is the spatial heterogeneity in geographical properties and climatic conditions therefore it is critical and is also challenging to develop integrated drought indices to monitor drought conditions over large scale regions jiao et al 2019 proposed the station enabled geographically independent integrated drought index giidi station to monitor drought in diverse regions by using the amse r soil moisture data however the time span only ten years of this dataset is short in this sense amse r soil moisture data cannot be used for long term persistent drought monitoring practice meanwhile the ecv sm soil moisture data has many advantages over other soil moisture data e g jia et al 2015 zeng et al 2015 wang et al 2016 therefore the ecv sm soil moisture data with longer time span than amse r soil moisture data were adopted in this current study in addition vci pci smci and tci were considered in the development of new drought index in this current study additionally most remotely sensed data based drought indices were integrated during growing season zhang and jia 2013 hao et al 2015 park et al 2017 the applicability of these integrated indices in other seasons has not been verified in their studies another issue is that some of the drought indices were developed by the traditional composition methods such as sdi midi and irsdi and the weight of the single indices determined by these methods may cause the integrated drought indices inability to adequately represent spatial variability park et al 2016 thus it is crucial to decide what weighting scheme should be accepted in combining multiple variables park et al 2016 how to develop a drought index in a right way is of great significance for drought monitoring at seasonal scale tree based machine learning techniques can not only process large data efficiently but can also prove to be powerful and flexible in many regression applications to quantify the relationship between drought related driving factors and drought conditions park et al 2016 therefore this study aimed to develop a new remote sensing drought index by a tree based ensemble method and assess the drought at seasonal scale for long term drought assessment across china in order to fully illustrate the reliability of the newly proposed drought index in drought monitoring at seasonal scale we also compared the integrated drought indices developed by two popular blending approaches namely principal component analysis and multiple linear regression thus the objectives of this study are to 1 develop a new drought monitoring index using microwave remotely sensed datasets and vci pci smci and tci 2 compare and evaluate the drought monitoring performance of the newly developed drought indices with the standing drought indices and also the real world observed droughts across china 3 perform drought monitoring practice across china using the newly proposed drought index in winter this study provides a new alternative drought monitoring tool with evident advantage over the standing drought monitoring method showing a theoretical framework for drought monitoring practice over other regions of the globe 2 data 2 1 in situ observed meteorological data in this study we used the daily meteorological data at 2474 stations and the period covers 1960 2014 fig 1 to compute the spi spei and pdsi the daily meteorological data contain precipitation air temperature and wind velocity https data cma cn 2 2 drought affected cropland area and crop yield the drought affected cropland

bureau of statistics at https data stats gov cn these statistical records were used to verify the drought monitoring performance of the newly developed drought index in this current study 2 3 land

6 km in spatial resolutions and of 5 min daily 8 days and monthly in temporal resolutions in this study the mod11a2 product was used which is the modis land surface temperature dataset and was sourced from https lpdaac usgs gov dataset discovery modis modis products table mod11a2 v006 the temporal and spatial resolutions of the mod11a2 lst are of 8 days and 1 km respectively more detailed information about mod11a2 lst can be found in wan et al 2015 2 4 normalized differential vegetation index ndvi the terra modis mod13a3 version 6 ndvi data were analyzed in this study these data were provided monthly at 1 kilometer spatial resolution as a gridded level 3 product in the sinusoidal projection the modis ndvi data complement noaa s advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr ndvi

product which were generated from the near real time 3 hourly trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42rt they were produced at the nasa ges disc the unit is in mm and the spatial resolution is 0 25 0 25 although the observed grid is bounded from 60 s to 60 n the high latitudes beyond 50 s n near real time retrievals were considered very unreliable and thus were screened out from the daily accumulations the validity data from 50 s to 50 n were used in this study the trmm precipitation data were sourced from earth science data system of nasa at https earthdata nasa gov the period of this data covers is 2002 2016 3 methods in this study vci tci pci and smci were taken as the input drought indices in the development of the new drought index multiple remote sensing drought index integrated by pca psdi ovdi multiple remote sensing drought index integrated by multiple linear regression mrsdi and multiple remote sensing drought index integrated by gradient boosting method gbmdi were taken as the integrated drought monitoring indices for purpose of visual comparison with spi or spei we found the meaningful break points of the drought index which was similar to a combined remote sensing drought index of sdci rhee et al 2010 and midi zhang and jia 2013 the droughts were categorized into four grades extreme drought severe drought moderate drought and mild drought table 1 the classification of spi was the same as spei 3 1 scaled remote sensing data formulas for each remote sensing variable are shown in table 2 3 1 1 vegetation condition index vci vci is the normalized version of ndvi vci can reflect impacts of climate changes on vegetation conditions and also vegetation responses to droughts quiring and ganesh 2010 vci can be computed as 1 vci ndvi i ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min wherein ndvi i ndvi max and ndvi min denote the pixel values of ndvi and related maximum and minimum values respectively in the same month during 2002 2016 vci ranges from 0 to 1 corresponding to the worse and the best vegetation conditions respectively alamdarloo et al 2018 3 1 2 temperature condition index tci kogan 1995a developed the tci using advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr thermal bands to determine the temperature related vegetation stress and also stress caused by excessive wetness tci can be computed as 2 tci lst max lst i lst max lst min wherein lst i lst max and lst min denote the pixel values of lst and related maximum and minimum values respectively in the same month during 2002 2016 the above equation reflects different responses of vegetation to temperature high temperatures in the middle of the growing season indicate unfavorable conditions for drought whilst low temperatures indicate mostly favorable conditions singh et al 2003 3 1 3 precipitation condition index pci in this study pci was defined for the detection of the precipitation deficits from climate signal the pci has the following equation du et al 2013 3 pci trmm i trmm min trmm max trmm min where trmm i trmm max and trmm min are the pixel values of precipitation and related maximum and minimum values respectively in the same month during 2002 2016 pci ranges from 0 to 1 in arid regions pci is close to 0 and in humid regions it is close to 1 3 1 4 soil moisture condition index smci soil moisture content is the major variable influencing agricultural droughts soil moisture variability can directly reflect deficit and surplus of soil water content in this case the smci can be computed as zhang and jia 2013 4 smci sm i sm min sm max sm min where sm i sm max and sm min are the pixel values of the soil moisture and related maximum minimum values respectively in the same month during 2002 2016 smci ranges from 0 to 1 showing humid to arid conditions 3 2 development of integrated drought index using pca method pca is a linear transformation reducing redundancy by translating and or rotating the axes of the original feature space so that the drought information can be represented without correlation in a new component space lasaponara 2006 pca method ringnér 2008 has been widely used in the development of the integrated drought index combination of the information by vci pci smci and tci can better monitor drought conditions in this case these four drought indices act as the variables x 1 x 2 x n the principal components can be expressed as the product of the original data in its standardized form x and eigenvectors e liu et al 2019 5 z x e where z is a m n matrix of pcs x is a m n matrix of the normalized observational data each element is processed by subtracting the mean value and is divided by the column standard deviation e is a pca derived n n matrix of the unit eigenvectors which can reflect the relationship between pcs and the original dataset the percent of the total variance explained by each component can be obtained by the following equation liu et al 2019 lasaponara 2006 6 α i λ i i 1 n λ i 100 where λ i i 1 n are the eigenvalues corresponding to eigenvectors e the first component contains the major portion of the variance information of the original dataset lasaponara 2006 therefore we chose the first component the pca method was done using the rstoolbox package based on r software environment the monthly tci vci smci pci were taken as the input variables the first principal component of the output was used as a new drought index i e multiple remote sensing drought index integrated by pca or simply psdi in this current study 3 3 development of the integrated drought index using the multiple linear regression method soil moisture is the hydrological cycle component pertaining to water transfer between soil vegetation and atmospheric system and is also the key factor monitoring agricultural drought sun et al 2017 soil moisture deficit is the major mechanism behind agricultural drought zhang et al 2018b in this study the smci was used as the dependent variable the tci pci vci were used as the independent variables then the multiple linear regression model was used to obtain monthly coefficients of each indicator the method was done in r software environment and we combined the tci pci vci indices and corresponding coefficients of each month to develop a new drought index i e the multiple remote sensing drought index integrated by multiple linear regression or simply mrsdi table 3 3 4 development of the integrated drought index using constrained optimization method the constrained optimization is the process of optimizing an objective function with respect to the target variables in the presence of constraints on these variables box 1965 in this study we put constrained conditions on remote sensing variables and maximized correlations between remote sensing variables and the in situ observed variables to optimize the parameters of the combination of remote sensing variables powell 1978 hao et al 2015 took as the constrained condition the most significant correlation coefficients between spi spei and vci tci smci and pci and then obtained the coefficients for each remotely sensed drought monitoring index in this study we also took the largest correlation coefficients as the constrained condition between vci pci smci tci and spei and then decided the coefficients for monthly remotely sensed drought monitoring index i e optimized vegetation drought index ovdi in this current study we compared spatiotemporal variation pattern and drought monitoring performance of ovdi with psdi mrsdi and gbmdi and also with the real world observed drought events 3 5 development of the integrated drought index using gradient boosting method gbm gradient boosting is a boosting technique to build both classification and regression models friedman 2001 friedman 2002 it has three important benefits de ath 2007 1 prediction error improves substantially 2 computation load is reduced 3 over learning is further reduced the combination of station data and remote sensing data can improve the accuracy of the index at spatial and temporal scales in this study we used the monthly spei pci vci smci tci as the input variables among them monthly spei was taken as the reference data the model outputs the relative influence of a predictor variable the relative influence of each individual variable is scaled so that the sum of them for all the input variables equal to 100 zhang and haghani 2015 in this case the gradient boosting method was done by the gbm package by the r software environment the scaled relative importance of the four variables were used as weights table 4 and the weighted combinations of the four variables were calculated to develop a new drought index i e the multiple remote sensing drought index integrated by gradient boosting method or simply gbmdi metrics for model performance were calculated using root mean squared error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 johnson et al 2017 table 4 summarizes the relative influence of each input variable to the gbm model output and the model produced r2 ranging from 0 30 to 0 47 and rmse ranging from 0 69 to 0 83 the model performance was not so good which may be due to certain unavoidable limitations in the data driven models ahmad et al 2010 in the following sections we found that the combined drought index developed by gbm model is more accurate than psdi and mrsdi 4 results and discussions this study aims to verify the rationale and accuracy of the integrated drought index developed in this study in drought monitoring practice using remotely sensed data we developed the integrated drought indices of psdi mrsdi and gbmdi by using pca method the multiple linear regressive method and the gradient boosting method respectively we also evaluated the drought monitoring performance and applicability of these three integrated drought indices in drought monitoring practice across china based on comparisons with the standing drought indices such as spi spei pdsi and also with the observed real world drought events in this study we found that the droughts occurred during july october 2002 december 2009 to february 2010 january april 2013 and other months of the typical drought events as the control drought regimes besides we also investigated and compared spatial patterns of droughts monitored by spei spi pdsi ovdi psdi mrsdi and gbmdi across china with aim to verify the drought monitoring performances of psdi mrsdi and gbmdi developed in this current study 4 1 the developed drought indices and correlations between drought indices the workflow of the development of the integrated drought index using smci pci vci and tci was shown in fig 2 we first used mrt modis reprojection tool to transform the remote sensing data of modis and then image mosaic and clip du et al 2013 besides we resampled the trmm and ecv data to make the spatial and temporal resolutions consistent for all the data analyzed in this study in this study the remote sensing data are calculated to monthly time scale and to 1 km in spatial scale zhang and jia 2013 hao et al 2015 it should be noted here that seasonal differences in impacts of influencing factors on droughts can be identified here we used pearson correlation analysis benesty et al 2009 to compare correlation coefficients between drought indices considered in this study and to evaluate drought monitoring performance of these drought indices in describing spatial and temporal pattern of droughts ji and peters 2003 fig 3 displays correlation coefficients amongst drought indices and related significance test results during 2002 2014 it can be seen from fig 3 that both psdi mrsdi and gbmdi are positively correlated with spei spi and pdsi and the correlation coefficients are significant at 0 01 level indicating that psdi mrsdi and gbmdi are in good agreement with station based drought monitoring indices in drought monitoring practice the correlation coefficients between psdi mrsdi gbmdi and pdsi were substantially low this may be because the pdsi is suitable for drought monitoring at longer timescales zhao et al 2017 by comparison we found that the correlation coefficients between psdi and spei spi and pdsi during the period from may to october were relatively high in july the correlation coefficient between psdi and spei reached 0 6 while low correlation coefficients can be found between psdi and spei spi during january to april and from november to december which may be due to the fact that integrated drought indices by the pca method may exclude some important information during the development of the drought indices hao et al 2015 the correlation coefficients between mrsdi and spei spi are statistically good for each month and the correlation coefficients reached larger than 0 4 in october the highest correlation coefficient between psdi and spei is 0 57 however the correlation coefficients between gbmdi and spei spi pdsi are higher than the correlation coefficients between mrsdi psdi and spei spi pdsi in july the correlation coefficient between gbmdi and spei reached 0 66 the correlation coefficients between gbmdi and spi spei are 0 1 being higher than those between psdi mrsdi and spi spei almost during all months that proves the gbmdi can monitor meteorological drought favorably the drought indices considered in this study are highly correlated in statistical sense with exception of vci higher correlation coefficients can be identified between smci and vci during april to october than during other months implying that vegetation conditions are highly impacted by the availability of soil moisture zhang and jia 2013 however psdi is in higher correlation with tci than with pci during non growing season while we found higher correlation coefficients between mrsdi gbmdi and pci in winter we observed negative correlation between vci and spei and between vci and spi and the correlation coefficients are not significant during december significant positive correlations were identified between vci and other drought indices during april to october seasonal degradation of vegetation conditions in winter may not adequately reflect impacts of droughts on vegetation conditions thus the correlation coefficients between vci and spei and spi are low in addition different correlations can be found between vci and spi due to seasons and different land use and land covers the strongest correlation between vci and spi can be found in dry farming areas coniferous forests shrubs and pastures vicente serrano 2007 in this case different seasons and different land use types have an impact on vci vs spi correlations park et al 2016 analyzed a number of natural factors affecting droughts indicating that lst showed higher relative importance for short term meteorological drought since the correlation between psdi and tci is high psdi may keep some functions of tci for monitoring short term meteorological drought 4 2 spatiotemporal patterns of drought monitored by drought indices fig 4 a and 4b show the temporal variations of the monthly droughts across china larger fluctuation magnitude can be observed in pdsi than in spi and spei changes during 2002 2014 compared with psdi the changes of mrsdi ovdi and gbmdi are more consistent with spi and spei besides we compared the temporal drought variations by different drought monitoring indices from january to march and from november to december for each year fig 4c and fig 4d however we can observe that the changes of ovdi and mrsdi were inconsistent with the changes of spi and spei from january to march in 2002 2004 and 2013 respectively droughts by spi spei were in more similar variation patterns with gbmdi than other drought indices in winter furthermore we used the linear regression model fan et al 2019 to fit the drought indices from 2002 to 2014 and showed the trends of the drought indices fig 5 the areas with decreasing trend in all drought indices can be found in southeast china spi spei and pdsi showed a decreasing trend in central china however psdi ovdi mrsdi and gbmdi showed a decreasing trend in the south part of the yangtze river basin zhou et al 2017 found that during 2001 2013 a statistically significant decreasing trend of isdi can be detected mostly in the south of the yangtze river basin and a significant increasing trend in parts of the western china this is consistent with the results observed by gbmdi droughts monitored by the ovdi and psdi were in a decreasing trend in the western china this may be because they tend to overestimate drought conditions in the arid regions 4 3 comparisons between psdi mrsdi ovdi and gbmdi based droughts and the real world droughts 4 3 1 autumn droughts in 2002 in 2002 moderate to severe droughts occurred in china according to the china national defense and drought relief report chen 2003 since the beginning of july especially after august most of the north china the eastern portion of the northwest china the lower yellow river basin and the parts of the southwest china have experienced severe droughts it can be seen from fig 6 that the drought in north china central china and northwestern parts of the southeast china was heavy in july and august and which is consistent with the spatial pattern of droughts across arid regions detected by spi spei psdi ovdi mrsdi and gbmdi however the severe autumn drought in north china is detected only in the area monitored by ovdi mrsdi and gbmdi during the period from september to november 2002 severe drought expanded from northern china to the northwestern china li et al 2018 in early september 2002 droughts in shandong shanxi shaanxi inner mongolia henan hebei and gansu provinces were also serious nevertheless droughts in shanxi shaanxi hebei and gansu provinces were alleviated in mid september throughout september droughts in shandong eastern hebei provinces and central inner mongolia were the most serious and lasted for the longest time interval the overall drought was serious and 123 million ha of crops were affected by droughts chen 2003 the spatial distribution of droughts monitored by each drought index in september was shown in fig 6 the spatial distribution of monthly droughts monitored by pdsi was almost identical which could be due to the fact that the drought timescale for which pdsi fits best is usually 9 18 months it was unsatisfactory for addressing short term droughts problems guttman 1998 vicente serrano et al 2010a the drought monitored by the mrsdi was heavier than those by psdi and gbmdi compared with psdi gbmdi has improved the accuracy of drought monitoring and compared with mrsdi it has improved the accuracy of drought intensity monitoring the drought conditions monitored by ovdi and gbmdi were closer to the real world observed droughts when compared to those by other drought indices 4 3 2 spring droughts in 2010 and spring droughts in 2013 fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of droughts in china monitored by different drought indices from december 2009 to february 2010 the drought in the southwestern china began to develop in the winter of 2009 and serious droughts continued to grow in the spring of 2010 table 5 it can be seen from fig 7 that the psdi ovdi and gbmdi monitored serious droughts in yunnan guangxi guizhou sichuan and chongqing from december 2009 to february 2010 which is consistent with the real world observed drought conditions in the southwestern china and these drought monitoring results are in good line with drought conditions monitored by spi and spei however the ovdi overestimated the drought intensity of the drought occurred in february and the mrsdi failed to monitor the serious drought in winter the spatial distribution characteristics of drought in december monitored by ovdi and in february monitored by psdi were not as accurate as those monitored by gbmdi compared with these drought indices the drought intensity of droughts monitored by gbmdi is more accurate than those monitored by aforementioned drought monitoring indices in this case gbmdi has the reliable performance in drought monitoring practice across china it can be seen from fig 8 that period from january to february was dominated by widespread droughts and droughts monitored by spi and spei indicate heavy droughts in sichuan and chongqing psdi ovdi and gbmdi have monitored heavy droughts in the northwestern and southwestern china but the intensity of droughts observed by mrsdi is low in march spi and spei monitored the severe droughts in the east parts of the northwestern china but failed to detect the droughts in yunnan ovdi mrsdi and gbmdi successfully monitored the droughts in yunnan in addition the drought in guangzhou shaanxi province was also severe in march the drought in hubei province has eased in march compared to that in february when compared to droughts monitored by psdi mrsdi and gbmdi droughts monitored by gbmdi were more accurate than those monitored by other drought indices during april drought conditions continued in gansu yunnan and eastern sichuan and droughts started to occur in jiangsu and anhui the drought in these areas was well monitored by the gbmdi furthermore spi and spei tend to underestimate drought conditions than the real world observed drought conditions pdsi also failed to monitor spatial variations of the short term droughts the overall drought monitoring performance of gbmdi is higher than other drought indices considered in this study 4 3 3 cases of extra typical drought events in order to further verify the drought monitoring accuracy of each drought index in describing the spatial distribution of drought in different periods we compared and analyzed three more drought events table 5 fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of drought monitored by psdi mrsdi ovdi and gbmdi in december 2003 july 2006 and march 2008 in the winter of 2003 guangxi jiangsu fujian and zhejiang provinces suffered severe drought it can be seen from fig 9b 9c that psdi did not detect drought in the southern region and ovdi overestimated the extent of drought gbmdi accurately monitored the intensity and spatial extent of droughts ovdi and gbmdi successfully monitored the severe droughts in sichuan and chongqing in july 2006 fig 9e 9f in comparison the drought spatial distribution monitored by ovdi and gbmdi in july 2006 was consistent however the results monitored by mrsdi and psdi are not in good line with the observed drought conditions fig 9e f g h severe drought occurred in the northeast china in march 2008 the intensity of droughts monitored by gbmdi is higher than that by psdi mrsdi and ovdi fig 9i 9j 9 k and 9 l the droughts monitored by gbmdi are more consistent with the observed drought conditions than other drought indices considered in this study all the results show that the gbmdi can monitor the spatial pattern and intensity of the drought events in a more accurate way when compared to other drought indices considered in this study above mentioned analyses suggest that the drought indices developed by the pca and multiple linear regression have some limitations in monitoring drought in winter severe drought was not successfully monitored by psdi fig 9 the mrsdi may underestimate the drought intensity of droughts occurred in winter this phenomenon may be caused by the two composition methods that failed to fully integrate all the information by single drought indices the gbmdi developed by gbm can handle complex interactions amongst input variables zhang and haghani 2015 therefore gbmdi can fully integrate the drought information by the single drought indices and reflect the intensity and the extent of the drought in an accurate way 4 3 4 drought changes in january and august soil moisture plays an important role in agricultural drought management mishra et al 2017 spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil moisture has considerable impacts on drought processes wang et al 2015 used spi and spei indices to analyze drought changes during last 52 years across china indicating wetting tendency over the arid regions however it should be noted here that different regions with different climate types and topographical features are characterized by different soil moisture properties nie et al 2008 showed that the soil can be covered by snow in winter which hinders the movement of water away from the soil and hence seasonal soil moisture changes can be observed since soil moisture is an important factor affecting droughts in order to compare drought changes as a result of different soil moisture volume in various regions we regionalized and compared the monthly droughts over china china was subdivided into four regions i e a b c and d according to the four major geographical divisions over china representing the qinghai tibet plateau the northwest china the northern china and the southern china the divisions of the region are the same as xu et al 2017 we compared the drought tendency within these four regions during august and january fig 10 indicates that the drought tendency by psdi mrsdi gbmdi and spi spei is similar with exception of drought tendency by psdi in d region during january however we found significant drought changes in different months and different sub regions in the qinghai tibet region the trends of drought monitored by drought indices considered in this study in january and august are in almost opposite variation pattern a i a ii and a iii indicate all drought indices considered in this study have monitored heavy droughts during august in 2006 2011 and 2013 a iv a ⅴ and a ⅵ show heavy droughts during january in 2010 and 2014 and the observed drought intensity in august is higher than that in january in the northwest china the consistent drought trends can be observed in january and august which is reverse to the monthly drought trends observed in the a region b i b ii and b iii indicate all drought indices have monitored heavy droughts in this study during august in 2002 and 2014 in b region it can be seen from illustrations of b iv b ⅴ and b ⅵ that drought indices considered in this study also monitored heavy droughts in january during 2002 and 2014 which was consistent with the observed drought conditions in august generally the intensity of droughts occurred in august is greater than that in january in the northern china the similar drought tendency during january and august can be observed c i c ii and c iii indicate heavy droughts monitored by drought indices in august during 2002 and 2014 in this study c iv c ⅴ and c ⅵ indicate similar drought tendency in january and is similar to that in b region d i d ii and d iii indicate heavy droughts in d region in august during 2003 and 2006 d iv d ⅴ and d ⅵ indicate heavy droughts in january during 2014 by drought indices considered in this study in general the drought intensity in january is higher than that in august in general in august the northwest and north china or sub regions b and c are characterized by arid climate with similar drought tendency the d region is dominated by abundant precipitation with forest vegetation condition and subtropical monsoon climate more precipitation in summer than other seasons results in higher evapotranspiration and higher soil moisture in summer and hence summer difference in droughts nie et al 2008 in january significant difference in drought intensity can be observed in the tibet plateau when compared to that in other regions which should be attributed to high altitude of the tibet plateau and hence different climate types soil moisture conditions vegetation conditions and so on lai et al 2016 4 3 5 the results monitored by drought indices compared with crop yield and drought affected areas in order to further verify monitoring performance of the remote sensing based drought indices we compared the drought affected croplands monitored by psdi mrsdi gbmdi and the real world observed drought affected cropland areas the drought affected area overlays crop fields extracted the paddy field and dry land based on the land use and land cover lulc data in 2015 sun et al 2017 based on the extracted cropland areas annual cells areas of moderate severe and extreme drought were considered for the analysis of the drought affected areas in this study rivera and penalba 2014 then we compared the computed the drought affected croplands and the real world observed drought affected croplands since the land use data only include the paddy field and dry land without considering the croplands for other grain crops zhang et al 2017a the actual drought affected cropland area is generally higher than that monitored by drought indices we also compared the values of the drought indices during the growing season april october with the standardized crop yield the standardized crop yield was calculated by the average and the standard deviation of crop yield during from 2002 to 2016 du et al 2013 it can be seen from fig 11 a that larger than the real world observed drought affected croplands can be observed in 2002 2007 and 2009 reaching more than 250000 km2 the largest drought affected cropland areas monitored by mrsdi and gbmdi was found in 2002 2007 and 2009 and that by psdi was in 2002 and 2007 the correlation coefficient was 0 52 between the trend of the drought affected cropland areas monitored by psdi and the trend of real world observed drought affected cropland areas the correlation coefficient was 0 92 between the trend of the drought affected cropland areas monitored by mrsdi gbmdi and the trend of real world observed drought affected cropland areas therefore the trends of the drought affected cropland areas monitored by mrsdi and gbmdi is basically consistent with the real world observed drought affected cropland area which can basically monitor the real world observed drought affected cropland area the drought affected cropland by the psdi is slightly different from the real world observed drought affected cropland fig 11b indicates that given the real world observed drought affected croplands areas of 2 0 105 km2 during 2002 2003 2006 and 2009 percentage of the monitored drought affected croplands areas by mrsdi to the real world observed drought affected croplands areas is larger than that monitored by psdi to the real world observed drought affected croplands areas the difference in percentages by mrsdi and psdi can reach as large as 40 while given the real world observed drought affected croplands areas of 1 3 105 km2 during 2008 2014 2015 and 2016 percentage of the monitored drought affected croplands areas by mrsdi to the real world observed drought affected croplands areas is a little bit lower than that monitored by psdi to the real world observed drought affected croplands areas the difference in percentages by mrsdi and psdi can reach as large as 30 however except in 2003 2005 2012 and 2016 during all the other years percentage of the drought affected croplands areas monitored by gbmdi to the real world observed drought affected croplands areas is all larger than that monitored by psdi and mrsdi to the real world observed drought affected croplands areas the maximum difference in percentages monitored by mrsdi and gbmdi can reach 56 the maximum difference in percentages monitored by psdi and gbmdi can reach 55 in this case we can conclude that gbmdi performs much better than mrsdi and psdi in monitoring drought affected cropland areas furthermore we also compared the drought indices with standardized crop yield it can be seen from fig 11c that the gbmdi has the higher correlation coefficient with the standardized yield which is 0 77 and the result also passed p value 0 01 significant test therefore the gbmdi can be more adapted used to monitor agricultural drought than psdi and mrsdi 4 4 spatial pattern of drought frequency across china figs 12 15 indicate remarkable difference in spatial pattern of drought frequency monitored by mrsdi psdi and gbmdi respectively in winter which can be attributed to the spatial heterogeneity of the soil moisture in other seasons we can identify similar spatial pattern of drought frequency monitored by psdi mrsdi and gbmdi respectively as can be seen from fig 12 that seasonal drought frequency of the extreme droughts monitored by psdi is greater than that by mrsdi and gbmdi there are seasonal differences in the frequency of extreme droughts monitored by these three drought indices i e higher drought frequency of the extreme droughts can be observed in summer than in other seasons in terms of spatial distribution of drought frequency the areas with higher drought frequency of the extreme droughts concentrate mainly in the arid and semi arid regions while lower drought frequency of the extreme droughts can be found in regions in the vicinity of the river systems across china which can be due to the fact that higher density of river system may imply more convenient irrigation and easier access to water resources as can be seen from fig 13 that higher drought frequency of severe droughts monitored by mrsdi and gbmdi can be observed in summer and autumn than in other two seasons the frequency of severe droughts detected by psdi is in basically even distribution in the four seasons in terms of spatial distribution higher drought frequency of severe droughts can be found mainly in the northwestern china in the southwestern part of china the drought frequency of the severe droughts is relatively low which can be attributed mainly to higher density of water systems therefore convenient irrigation conditions and easy access to water resources greatly alleviate drought hazards it can be seen from fig 14 that the drought frequency of moderate droughts is in even spatial distribution in four seasons in autumn however the drought frequency of the moderate droughts monitored by mrsdi and gbmdi is generally higher than that by psdi in terms of spatial distribution in general we observed relatively high drought frequency of moderate droughts in all seasons in the xinjiang and the southeast china as can be seen from fig 15 that the drought frequency of the light droughts monitored by the mrsdi is higher than that by the psdi and gbmdi from seasonal perspective the drought frequency of the light droughts monitored by these three indices for each season is higher than that of the extreme droughts severe droughts and moderate droughts in addition from the spatial distribution perspective we can conclude that relatively higher drought frequency of the light droughts can be identified mainly in the northwest china generally lower drought frequency can be found in regions with high density of water systems where more convenient irrigation can be expected meanwhile relatively high drought frequency of severe and moderate droughts can be observed mainly in the northwest and southeast china where wheat and rice are the dominant crops therefore from the perspective of water resources management and regional water resources allocation more attention should be paid to areas with severe and moderate droughts 5 conclusions based on four drought monitoring indices i e vci pci smci and tci we obtained three integrated remote sensing drought monitoring indices i e psdi mrsdi and gbmdi to verify and compare monitoring performance of these three integrated drought indices at seasonal scale we compared drought monitoring results by psdi mrsdi and gbmdi and those by spei and spi based on in situ observed meteorological data besides based on the real world observed drought regimes and droughts monitored by drought indices we analyzed spatial pattern and temporal variations of drought regimes during 2002 2016 the aforementioned results helped us to obtain the following interesting and important findings and conclusions 1 we quantified relations between spei spi pdsi and the integrated drought indices i e psdi mrsdi and gbmdi we found positive correlations between drought indices and these relations are significant at 0 01 significance level meanwhile the results indicate that the proposed integrated drought monitoring indices and other indices can identify drought conditions in relatively consistency 2 to corroborate monitoring accuracy of the drought regimes by the psdi mrsdi and gbmdi at the monthly scale we compared the spatiotemporal variations and spatial distribution of typical drought events across china during 2002 2014 based on the monitoring results by psdi mrsdi and gbmdi we found that gbmdi can well describe the intensities and spatiotemporal patterns of droughts in a more accurate way than other integrated drought indices due to the uneven spatial distribution of soil moisture in china the drought tendency and drought intensity will also vary across different regions across china comparison of spi spei psdi mrsdi and gbmdi in monitoring the drought tendencies across four regions classified in this study during january and august indicated basically consistent monitoring results of the drought tendency meanwhile comparison of drought tendencies in different regions indicated similar drought tendency in the northwest and north china in addition the drought intensity in the south china in august is greater than that in january and the drought conditions are the opposite in other regions except south china 3 comparison between the real world observed drought affected croplands areas and those by integrated drought indices indicated that the trends of the drought affected cropland areas monitored by mrsdi and gbmdi is basically consistent with the real world observed drought affected cropland area meanwhile the percentage of the drought affected cropland areas monitored by gbmdi to the real world observed drought affected cropland area is higher than that by psdi and mrsdi besides the correlation between gbmdi and standardized crop yield is better than that of psdi and mrsdi therefore the gbmdi performs much better than mrsdi and psdi in monitoring agriculture drought 4 high drought frequency can be observed for the severe and moderate droughts across regions with high density of water system which will imply convenient agricultural irrigation and easy access to the water resources and therefore the alleviated droughts can be expected in this study we proposed new drought monitoring indices and provide alternative drought monitoring tools for large scale drought monitoring across china and also in other regions of the

2674,in this study we proposed a new integrated remote sensing drought monitoring indices i e multiple remote sensing drought index integrated by principal component analysis psdi multiple remote sensing drought index integrated by multiple linear regression mrsdi and multiple remote sensing drought index integrated by gradient boosting method gbmdi based on the precipitation condition index pci temperature condition index tci vegetation condition index vci and soil moisture condition index smci the monitoring performance of psdi mrsdi and gbmdi was compared and verified based on the real world observed droughts during 2002 to 2016 we also evidenced drought monitoring performance of the psdi mrsdi and gbmdi by comparison between psdi mrsdi gbmdi and spei spi and pdsi based on the in situ observed meteorological data we found that the spatiotemporal characteristics of droughts monitored by the psdi mrsdi and gbmdi were generally in good agreement with those by the spi and spei the gbmdi performs better than psdi and mrsdi in describing drought processes and spatial patterns of droughts of different drought intensities comparison between the real world observed drought affected croplands and those monitored by psdi mrsdi and gbmdi indicated better drought monitoring performance of gbmdi than psdi and mrsdi in monitoring droughts across widespread drought affected regions besides the trend of gbmdi is in good agreement with standardized crop yield therefore gbmdi should be the first choice in drought monitoring practice the gbmdi developed in this study can help to provide an alternative drought monitoring index for large scale drought monitoring across china and also in other regions of the globe keywords remote sensing drought monitoring multiple linear regression principle component analysis gradient boosting method data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is of stochastic nature having devastating impacts on human society and eco environment zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2017b thus drought is often considered as one of the costliest and also less understood natural hazards of the world salinger et al 2000 zargar et al 2011 coumou and rahmstorf 2012 zhang et al 2018a drought induced global economic losses were estimated to be as high as 6 to 8 billion us dollars each year being far more than other meteorological disasters wilhite 2000 hence how to enhance human mitigation to droughts is crucial for sustainable development of human society and also for ecological conservation while monitoring of droughts is the first step into human mitigation and related management of drought hazards yan et al 2018 hence development and application of effective and efficient drought indices mean much for prediction and management of drought hazards e g sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a there stands a range of drought indices such as standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010b and palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 spi considers precipitation changes only without consideration of impacts of other factors on occurrence of droughts such as air temperature wind speed evapotranspiration and soil moisture um et al 2018 the pdsi is widely used to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of drought and drought forecasting liu et al 2013 but it may have some limitations in addressing short term droughts and describing the effect of droughts on natural systems guttman 1998 vicente serrano et al 2010a the spei was defined by water deficiency or water surpluses based on the difference between evapotranspiration and precipitation it is a multi scalar drought index for quantifying the onset duration and magnitude of drought zhang et al 2018a therefore spei has been widely used in drought monitoring practice because it is better than spi in calculating water balance mathematically and is better than pdsi in monitoring short term droughts hao et al 2015 hao and singh 2015 liu et al 2018 um et al 2018 wang et al 2015 besides all these drought indices are computed based on in situ observed meteorological variables the in situ observations are comparatively accurate but cannot describe areal variations of meteorological variables sun et al 2017 generally spatial patterns of droughts based on in situ observations were analyzed using spatial interpolation techniques however spatial interpolations using different methods usually introduce extra uncertainties in drought monitoring results in spatial sense swain et al 2011 park et al 2016 remote sensing data has the advantage of providing near real time data at various spatial and temporal scales therefore it has been widely used in drought monitoring in recent years aghakouchak et al 2015 guo et al 2019 actually remote sensing data has been widely used in drought monitoring practice such as normalized differential vegetation index ndvi data extracted from advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr were used to analyze impacts of droughts on vegetation conditions tucker 1979 in recent years microwave remote sensing data have also been widely used in drought monitoring such as tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr e essential climate variable soil moisture ecv sm jia et al 2015 carrão et al 2015 park et al 2016 liu et al 2017 besides a range of drought monitoring indices were proposed and developed based on remote sensing data such as vegetation condition index vci kogan 1995b temperature condition index tci kogan 1995a standardized soil moisture index ssi aghakouchak 2014 soil moisture condition index smci zhang and jia 2013 normalized difference water index ndwi gao 1996 and the normalized multi band drought index nmdi wang and qu 2007 however these drought indices using single hydrometeorological variable only can monitor drought through certain drought related variables e g vegetation land surface temperature soil moisture and cannot to capture drought information reliably tian et al 2018 guo et al 2019 in recent years development of integrated drought monitoring index considering multiple factors influencing occurrence of droughts has aroused growing human concerns with focus on agricultural drought monitoring sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a hao et al 2015 the vegetation health index vhi kogan 1995a kogan 1995b was developed by combining vci and tci however using vhi to monitor drought condition has to be undertaken with caution in high latitude regions karnieli et al 2006 rhee et al 2010 combined three drought indices i e tci pci precipitation condition index vci and proposed the scaled drought condition index sdci for agricultural drought monitoring zhang and jia 2013 developed the microwave integrated drought index midi via combination of tci pci and smci with aim to monitor short term meteorological droughts however the sdci and the midi were established for a specific location and the combination method require multiple trials to determine weights to build the model shen et al 2019 du et al 2013 developed the synthesized drought index sdi using the principle component analysis pca method based on vci tci and pci to monitor agricultural droughts across the shandong province china however the principal component analysis may lose useful drought information during the dimension reducing process hao et al 2015 thus hao et al 2015 proposed the optimized meteorological drought index omdi and the optimized vegetation drought index ovdi with vci tci pci and smci using the constrained optimization method for the drought monitoring practice across the southwestern china the establishment of ovdi relies too much on the correlation with spei and may not be able to make full use of the characteristic information of the single drought indices recent years witnessed progress in development of integrated drought monitoring indices and in drought monitoring practices azmi and rüdiger 2018 for example azmi et al 2016 developed a data fusion based drought index and analyzed for three different locations of varying land use and climate regimes in australia linear regression is a simple and easy to implement method sun et al 2017 used soil moisture as the dependent variable and developed the integrated remote sensing drought monitoring index irsdi using a multiple linear regressive method most researches mainly focused on drought monitoring practice at regional scale using remotely sensed datasets these indices such as sdci and midi were developed under a narrow range of environmental conditions and their relatively poor performance is significant when these indices were applied for drought monitoring in different climate regions jiao et al 2019 a big challenge for these drought indices in monitoring of different drought conditions is the spatial heterogeneity in geographical properties and climatic conditions therefore it is critical and is also challenging to develop integrated drought indices to monitor drought conditions over large scale regions jiao et al 2019 proposed the station enabled geographically independent integrated drought index giidi station to monitor drought in diverse regions by using the amse r soil moisture data however the time span only ten years of this dataset is short in this sense amse r soil moisture data cannot be used for long term persistent drought monitoring practice meanwhile the ecv sm soil moisture data has many advantages over other soil moisture data e g jia et al 2015 zeng et al 2015 wang et al 2016 therefore the ecv sm soil moisture data with longer time span than amse r soil moisture data were adopted in this current study in addition vci pci smci and tci were considered in the development of new drought index in this current study additionally most remotely sensed data based drought indices were integrated during growing season zhang and jia 2013 hao et al 2015 park et al 2017 the applicability of these integrated indices in other seasons has not been verified in their studies another issue is that some of the drought indices were developed by the traditional composition methods such as sdi midi and irsdi and the weight of the single indices determined by these methods may cause the integrated drought indices inability to adequately represent spatial variability park et al 2016 thus it is crucial to decide what weighting scheme should be accepted in combining multiple variables park et al 2016 how to develop a drought index in a right way is of great significance for drought monitoring at seasonal scale tree based machine learning techniques can not only process large data efficiently but can also prove to be powerful and flexible in many regression applications to quantify the relationship between drought related driving factors and drought conditions park et al 2016 therefore this study aimed to develop a new remote sensing drought index by a tree based ensemble method and assess the drought at seasonal scale for long term drought assessment across china in order to fully illustrate the reliability of the newly proposed drought index in drought monitoring at seasonal scale we also compared the integrated drought indices developed by two popular blending approaches namely principal component analysis and multiple linear regression thus the objectives of this study are to 1 develop a new drought monitoring index using microwave remotely sensed datasets and vci pci smci and tci 2 compare and evaluate the drought monitoring performance of the newly developed drought indices with the standing drought indices and also the real world observed droughts across china 3 perform drought monitoring practice across china using the newly proposed drought index in winter this study provides a new alternative drought monitoring tool with evident advantage over the standing drought monitoring method showing a theoretical framework for drought monitoring practice over other regions of the globe 2 data 2 1 in situ observed meteorological data in this study we used the daily meteorological data at 2474 stations and the period covers 1960 2014 fig 1 to compute the spi spei and pdsi the daily meteorological data contain precipitation air temperature and wind velocity https data cma cn 2 2 drought affected cropland area and crop yield the drought affected cropland area data during 2002 2016 were sourced from the crop databank of the chinese crop farming information center at https zzys agri gov cn nongqing aspx the crop yield data were sourced from national bureau of statistics at https data stats gov cn these statistical records were used to verify the drought monitoring performance of the newly developed drought index in this current study 2 3 land surface temperature lst the lst data are the modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data modis is a key instrument aboard the terra and aqua satellites the lst data are of 1 km 5 6 km and 6 km in spatial resolutions and of 5 min daily 8 days and monthly in temporal resolutions in this study the mod11a2 product was used which is the modis land surface temperature dataset and was sourced from https lpdaac usgs gov dataset discovery modis modis products table mod11a2 v006 the temporal and spatial resolutions of the mod11a2 lst are of 8 days and 1 km respectively more detailed information about mod11a2 lst can be found in wan et al 2015 2 4 normalized differential vegetation index ndvi the terra modis mod13a3 version 6 ndvi data were analyzed in this study these data were provided monthly at 1 kilometer spatial resolution as a gridded level 3 product in the sinusoidal projection the modis ndvi data complement noaa s advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr ndvi products and provide continuity for time series historical applications didan 2015 the modis ndvi and evi products were computed from surface reflectance corrected for molecular scattering ozone absorption and aerosols didan 2015 the spatial resolution of the modis ndvi data is 0 25 km 0 5 km 1 km and 5 6 km the ndvi data covering the period of 2002 2016 were sourced from https lpdaac usgs gov dataset discovery modis modis products table mod13a3 v006 2 5 tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm the trmm precipitation data used in this study are the daily accumulated precipitation product which were generated from the near real time 3 hourly trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42rt they were produced at the nasa ges disc the unit is in mm and the spatial resolution is 0 25 0 25 although the observed grid is bounded from 60 s to 60 n the high latitudes beyond 50 s n near real time retrievals were considered very unreliable and thus were screened out from the daily accumulations the validity data from 50 s to 50 n were used in this study the trmm precipitation data were sourced from earth science data system of nasa at https earthdata nasa gov the period of this data covers is 2002 2016 3 methods in this study vci tci pci and smci were taken as the input drought indices in the development of the new drought index multiple remote sensing drought index integrated by pca psdi ovdi multiple remote sensing drought index integrated by multiple linear regression mrsdi and multiple remote sensing drought index integrated by gradient boosting method gbmdi were taken as the integrated drought monitoring indices for purpose of visual comparison with spi or spei we found the meaningful break points of the drought index which was similar to a combined remote sensing drought index of sdci rhee et al 2010 and midi zhang and jia 2013 the droughts were categorized into four grades extreme drought severe drought moderate drought and mild drought table 1 the classification of spi was the same as spei 3 1 scaled remote sensing data formulas for each remote sensing variable are shown in table 2 3 1 1 vegetation condition index vci vci is the normalized version of ndvi vci can reflect impacts of climate changes on vegetation conditions and also vegetation responses to droughts quiring and ganesh 2010 vci can be computed as 1 vci ndvi i ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min wherein ndvi i ndvi max and ndvi min denote the pixel values of ndvi and related maximum and minimum values respectively in the same month during 2002 2016 vci ranges from 0 to 1 corresponding to the worse and the best vegetation conditions respectively alamdarloo et al 2018 3 1 2 temperature condition index tci kogan 1995a developed the tci using advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr thermal bands to determine the temperature related vegetation stress and also stress caused by excessive wetness tci can be computed as 2 tci lst max lst i lst max lst min wherein lst i lst max and lst min denote the pixel values of lst and related maximum and minimum values respectively in the same month during 2002 2016 the above equation reflects different responses of vegetation to temperature high temperatures in the middle of the growing season indicate unfavorable conditions for drought whilst low temperatures indicate mostly favorable conditions singh et al 2003 3 1 3 precipitation condition index pci in this study pci was defined for the detection of the precipitation deficits from climate signal the pci has the following equation du et al 2013 3 pci trmm i trmm min trmm max trmm min where trmm i trmm max and trmm min are the pixel values of precipitation and related maximum and minimum values respectively in the same month during 2002 2016 pci ranges from 0 to 1 in arid regions pci is close to 0 and in humid regions it is close to 1 3 1 4 soil moisture condition index smci soil moisture content is the major variable influencing agricultural droughts soil moisture variability can directly reflect deficit and surplus of soil water content in this case the smci can be computed as zhang and jia 2013 4 smci sm i sm min sm max sm min where sm i sm max and sm min are the pixel values of the soil moisture and related maximum minimum values respectively in the same month during 2002 2016 smci ranges from 0 to 1 showing humid to arid conditions 3 2 development of integrated drought index using pca method pca is a linear transformation reducing redundancy by translating and or rotating the axes of the original feature space so that the drought information can be represented without correlation in a new component space lasaponara 2006 pca method ringnér 2008 has been widely used in the development of the integrated drought index combination of the information by vci pci smci and tci can better monitor drought conditions in this case these four drought indices act as the variables x 1 x 2 x n the principal components can be expressed as the product of the original data in its standardized form x and eigenvectors e liu et al 2019 5 z x e where z is a m n matrix of pcs x is a m n matrix of the normalized observational data each element is processed by subtracting the mean value and is divided by the column standard deviation e is a pca derived n n matrix of the unit eigenvectors which can reflect the relationship between pcs and the original dataset the percent of the total variance explained by each component can be obtained by the following equation liu et al 2019 lasaponara 2006 6 α i λ i i 1 n λ i 100 where λ i i 1 n are the eigenvalues corresponding to eigenvectors e the first component contains the major portion of the variance information of the original dataset lasaponara 2006 therefore we chose the first component the pca method was done using the rstoolbox package based on r software environment the monthly tci vci smci pci were taken as the input variables the first principal component of the output was used as a new drought index i e multiple remote sensing drought index integrated by pca or simply psdi in this current study 3 3 development of the integrated drought index using the multiple linear regression method soil moisture is the hydrological cycle component pertaining to water transfer between soil vegetation and atmospheric system and is also the key factor monitoring agricultural drought sun et al 2017 soil moisture deficit is the major mechanism behind agricultural drought zhang et al 2018b in this study the smci was used as the dependent variable the tci pci vci were used as the independent variables then the multiple linear regression model was used to obtain monthly coefficients of each indicator the method was done in r software environment and we combined the tci pci vci indices and corresponding coefficients of each month to develop a new drought index i e the multiple remote sensing drought index integrated by multiple linear regression or simply mrsdi table 3 3 4 development of the integrated drought index using constrained optimization method the constrained optimization is the process of optimizing an objective function with respect to the target variables in the presence of constraints on these variables box 1965 in this study we put constrained conditions on remote sensing variables and maximized correlations between remote sensing variables and the in situ observed variables to optimize the parameters of the combination of remote sensing variables powell 1978 hao et al 2015 took as the constrained condition the most significant correlation coefficients between spi spei and vci tci smci and pci and then obtained the coefficients for each remotely sensed drought monitoring index in this study we also took the largest correlation coefficients as the constrained condition between vci pci smci tci and spei and then decided the coefficients for monthly remotely sensed drought monitoring index i e optimized vegetation drought index ovdi in this current study we compared spatiotemporal variation pattern and drought monitoring performance of ovdi with psdi mrsdi and gbmdi and also with the real world observed drought events 3 5 development of the integrated drought index using gradient boosting method gbm gradient boosting is a boosting technique to build both classification and regression models friedman 2001 friedman 2002 it has three important benefits de ath 2007 1 prediction error improves substantially 2 computation load is reduced 3 over learning is further reduced the combination of station data and remote sensing data can improve the accuracy of the index at spatial and temporal scales in this study we used the monthly spei pci vci smci tci as the input variables among them monthly spei was taken as the reference data the model outputs the relative influence of a predictor variable the relative influence of each individual variable is scaled so that the sum of them for all the input variables equal to 100 zhang and haghani 2015 in this case the gradient boosting method was done by the gbm package by the r software environment the scaled relative importance of the four variables were used as weights table 4 and the weighted combinations of the four variables were calculated to develop a new drought index i e the multiple remote sensing drought index integrated by gradient boosting method or simply gbmdi metrics for model performance were calculated using root mean squared error rmse and the coefficient of determination r2 johnson et al 2017 table 4 summarizes the relative influence of each input variable to the gbm model output and the model produced r2 ranging from 0 30 to 0 47 and rmse ranging from 0 69 to 0 83 the model performance was not so good which may be due to certain unavoidable limitations in the data driven models ahmad et al 2010 in the following sections we found that the combined drought index developed by gbm model is more accurate than psdi and mrsdi 4 results and discussions this study aims to verify the rationale and accuracy of the integrated drought index developed in this study in drought monitoring practice using remotely sensed data we developed the integrated drought indices of psdi mrsdi and gbmdi by using pca method the multiple linear regressive method and the gradient boosting method respectively we also evaluated the drought monitoring performance and applicability of these three integrated drought indices in drought monitoring practice across china based on comparisons with the standing drought indices such as spi spei pdsi and also with the observed real world drought events in this study we found that the droughts occurred during july october 2002 december 2009 to february 2010 january april 2013 and other months of the typical drought events as the control drought regimes besides we also investigated and compared spatial patterns of droughts monitored by spei spi pdsi ovdi psdi mrsdi and gbmdi across china with aim to verify the drought monitoring performances of psdi mrsdi and gbmdi developed in this current study 4 1 the developed drought indices and correlations between drought indices the workflow of the development of the integrated drought index using smci pci vci and tci was shown in fig 2 we first used mrt modis reprojection tool to transform the remote sensing data of modis and then image mosaic and clip du et al 2013 besides we resampled the trmm and ecv data to make the spatial and temporal resolutions consistent for all the data analyzed in this study in this study the remote sensing data are calculated to monthly time scale and to 1 km in spatial scale zhang and jia 2013 hao et al 2015 it should be noted here that seasonal differences in impacts of influencing factors on droughts can be identified here we used pearson correlation analysis benesty et al 2009 to compare correlation coefficients between drought indices considered in this study and to evaluate drought monitoring performance of these drought indices in describing spatial and temporal pattern of droughts ji and peters 2003 fig 3 displays correlation coefficients amongst drought indices and related significance test results during 2002 2014 it can be seen from fig 3 that both psdi mrsdi and gbmdi are positively correlated with spei spi and pdsi and the correlation coefficients are significant at 0 01 level indicating that psdi mrsdi and gbmdi are in good agreement with station based drought monitoring indices in drought monitoring practice the correlation coefficients between psdi mrsdi gbmdi and pdsi were substantially low this may be because the pdsi is suitable for drought monitoring at longer timescales zhao et al 2017 by comparison we found that the correlation coefficients between psdi and spei spi and pdsi during the period from may to october were relatively high in july the correlation coefficient between psdi and spei reached 0 6 while low correlation coefficients can be found between psdi and spei spi during january to april and from november to december which may be due to the fact that integrated drought indices by the pca method may exclude some important information during the development of the drought indices hao et al 2015 the correlation coefficients between mrsdi and spei spi are statistically good for each month and the correlation coefficients reached larger than 0 4 in october the highest correlation coefficient between psdi and spei is 0 57 however the correlation coefficients between gbmdi and spei spi pdsi are higher than the correlation coefficients between mrsdi psdi and spei spi pdsi in july the correlation coefficient between gbmdi and spei reached 0 66 the correlation coefficients between gbmdi and spi spei are 0 1 being higher than those between psdi mrsdi and spi spei almost during all months that proves the gbmdi can monitor meteorological drought favorably the drought indices considered in this study are highly correlated in statistical sense with exception of vci higher correlation coefficients can be identified between smci and vci during april to october than during other months implying that vegetation conditions are highly impacted by the availability of soil moisture zhang and jia 2013 however psdi is in higher correlation with tci than with pci during non growing season while we found higher correlation coefficients between mrsdi gbmdi and pci in winter we observed negative correlation between vci and spei and between vci and spi and the correlation coefficients are not significant during december significant positive correlations were identified between vci and other drought indices during april to october seasonal degradation of vegetation conditions in winter may not adequately reflect impacts of droughts on vegetation conditions thus the correlation coefficients between vci and spei and spi are low in addition different correlations can be found between vci and spi due to seasons and different land use and land covers the strongest correlation between vci and spi can be found in dry farming areas coniferous forests shrubs and pastures vicente serrano 2007 in this case different seasons and different land use types have an impact on vci vs spi correlations park et al 2016 analyzed a number of natural factors affecting droughts indicating that lst showed higher relative importance for short term meteorological drought since the correlation between psdi and tci is high psdi may keep some functions of tci for monitoring short term meteorological drought 4 2 spatiotemporal patterns of drought monitored by drought indices fig 4 a and 4b show the temporal variations of the monthly droughts across china larger fluctuation magnitude can be observed in pdsi than in spi and spei changes during 2002 2014 compared with psdi the changes of mrsdi ovdi and gbmdi are more consistent with spi and spei besides we compared the temporal drought variations by different drought monitoring indices from january to march and from november to december for each year fig 4c and fig 4d however we can observe that the changes of ovdi and mrsdi were inconsistent with the changes of spi and spei from january to march in 2002 2004 and 2013 respectively droughts by spi spei were in more similar variation patterns with gbmdi than other drought indices in winter furthermore we used the linear regression model fan et al 2019 to fit the drought indices from 2002 to 2014 and showed the trends of the drought indices fig 5 the areas with decreasing trend in all drought indices can be found in southeast china spi spei and pdsi showed a decreasing trend in central china however psdi ovdi mrsdi and gbmdi showed a decreasing trend in the south part of the yangtze river basin zhou et al 2017 found that during 2001 2013 a statistically significant decreasing trend of isdi can be detected mostly in the south of the yangtze river basin and a significant increasing trend in parts of the western china this is consistent with the results observed by gbmdi droughts monitored by the ovdi and psdi were in a decreasing trend in the western china this may be because they tend to overestimate drought conditions in the arid regions 4 3 comparisons between psdi mrsdi ovdi and gbmdi based droughts and the real world droughts 4 3 1 autumn droughts in 2002 in 2002 moderate to severe droughts occurred in china according to the china national defense and drought relief report chen 2003 since the beginning of july especially after august most of the north china the eastern portion of the northwest china the lower yellow river basin and the parts of the southwest china have experienced severe droughts it can be seen from fig 6 that the drought in north china central china and northwestern parts of the southeast china was heavy in july and august and which is consistent with the spatial pattern of droughts across arid regions detected by spi spei psdi ovdi mrsdi and gbmdi however the severe autumn drought in north china is detected only in the area monitored by ovdi mrsdi and gbmdi during the period from september to november 2002 severe drought expanded from northern china to the northwestern china li et al 2018 in early september 2002 droughts in shandong shanxi shaanxi inner mongolia henan hebei and gansu provinces were also serious nevertheless droughts in shanxi shaanxi hebei and gansu provinces were alleviated in mid september throughout september droughts in shandong eastern hebei provinces and central inner mongolia were the most serious and lasted for the longest time interval the overall drought was serious and 123 million ha of crops were affected by droughts chen 2003 the spatial distribution of droughts monitored by each drought index in september was shown in fig 6 the spatial distribution of monthly droughts monitored by pdsi was almost identical which could be due to the fact that the drought timescale for which pdsi fits best is usually 9 18 months it was unsatisfactory for addressing short term droughts problems guttman 1998 vicente serrano et al 2010a the drought monitored by the mrsdi was heavier than those by psdi and gbmdi compared with psdi gbmdi has improved the accuracy of drought monitoring and compared with mrsdi it has improved the accuracy of drought intensity monitoring the drought conditions monitored by ovdi and gbmdi were closer to the real world observed droughts when compared to those by other drought indices 4 3 2 spring droughts in 2010 and spring droughts in 2013 fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of droughts in china monitored by different drought indices from december 2009 to february 2010 the drought in the southwestern china began to develop in the winter of 2009 and serious droughts continued to grow in the spring of 2010 table 5 it can be seen from fig 7 that the psdi ovdi and gbmdi monitored serious droughts in yunnan guangxi guizhou sichuan and chongqing from december 2009 to february 2010 which is consistent with the real world observed drought conditions in the southwestern china and these drought monitoring results are in good line with drought conditions monitored by spi and spei however the ovdi overestimated the drought intensity of the drought occurred in february and the mrsdi failed to monitor the serious drought in winter the spatial distribution characteristics of drought in december monitored by ovdi and in february monitored by psdi were not as accurate as those monitored by gbmdi compared with these drought indices the drought intensity of droughts monitored by gbmdi is more accurate than those monitored by aforementioned drought monitoring indices in this case gbmdi has the reliable performance in drought monitoring practice across china it can be seen from fig 8 that period from january to february was dominated by widespread droughts and droughts monitored by spi and spei indicate heavy droughts in sichuan and chongqing psdi ovdi and gbmdi have monitored heavy droughts in the northwestern and southwestern china but the intensity of droughts observed by mrsdi is low in march spi and spei monitored the severe droughts in the east parts of the northwestern china but failed to detect the droughts in yunnan ovdi mrsdi and gbmdi successfully monitored the droughts in yunnan in addition the drought in guangzhou shaanxi province was also severe in march the drought in hubei province has eased in march compared to that in february when compared to droughts monitored by psdi mrsdi and gbmdi droughts monitored by gbmdi were more accurate than those monitored by other drought indices during april drought conditions continued in gansu yunnan and eastern sichuan and droughts started to occur in jiangsu and anhui the drought in these areas was well monitored by the gbmdi furthermore spi and spei tend to underestimate drought conditions than the real world observed drought conditions pdsi also failed to monitor spatial variations of the short term droughts the overall drought monitoring performance of gbmdi is higher than other drought indices considered in this study 4 3 3 cases of extra typical drought events in order to further verify the drought monitoring accuracy of each drought index in describing the spatial distribution of drought in different periods we compared and analyzed three more drought events table 5 fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of drought monitored by psdi mrsdi ovdi and gbmdi in december 2003 july 2006 and march 2008 in the winter of 2003 guangxi jiangsu fujian and zhejiang provinces suffered severe drought it can be seen from fig 9b 9c that psdi did not detect drought in the southern region and ovdi overestimated the extent of drought gbmdi accurately monitored the intensity and spatial extent of droughts ovdi and gbmdi successfully monitored the severe droughts in sichuan and chongqing in july 2006 fig 9e 9f in comparison the drought spatial distribution monitored by ovdi and gbmdi in july 2006 was consistent however the results monitored by mrsdi and psdi are not in good line with the observed drought conditions fig 9e f g h severe drought occurred in the northeast china in march 2008 the intensity of droughts monitored by gbmdi is higher than that by psdi mrsdi and ovdi fig 9i 9j 9 k and 9 l the droughts monitored by gbmdi are more consistent with the observed drought conditions than other drought indices considered in this study all the results show that the gbmdi can monitor the spatial pattern and intensity of the drought events in a more accurate way when compared to other drought indices considered in this study above mentioned analyses suggest that the drought indices developed by the pca and multiple linear regression have some limitations in monitoring drought in winter severe drought was not successfully monitored by psdi fig 9 the mrsdi may underestimate the drought intensity of droughts occurred in winter this phenomenon may be caused by the two composition methods that failed to fully integrate all the information by single drought indices the gbmdi developed by gbm can handle complex interactions amongst input variables zhang and haghani 2015 therefore gbmdi can fully integrate the drought information by the single drought indices and reflect the intensity and the extent of the drought in an accurate way 4 3 4 drought changes in january and august soil moisture plays an important role in agricultural drought management mishra et al 2017 spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil moisture has considerable impacts on drought processes wang et al 2015 used spi and spei indices to analyze drought changes during last 52 years across china indicating wetting tendency over the arid regions however it should be noted here that different regions with different climate types and topographical features are characterized by different soil moisture properties nie et al 2008 showed that the soil can be covered by snow in winter which hinders the movement of water away from the soil and hence seasonal soil moisture changes can be observed since soil moisture is an important factor affecting droughts in order to compare drought changes as a result of different soil moisture volume in various regions we regionalized and compared the monthly droughts over china china was subdivided into four regions i e a b c and d according to the four major geographical divisions over china representing the qinghai tibet plateau the northwest china the northern china and the southern china the divisions of the region are the same as xu et al 2017 we compared the drought tendency within these four regions during august and january fig 10 indicates that the drought tendency by psdi mrsdi gbmdi and spi spei is similar with exception of drought tendency by psdi in d region during january however we found significant drought changes in different months and different sub regions in the qinghai tibet region the trends of drought monitored by drought indices considered in this study in january and august are in almost opposite variation pattern a i a ii and a iii indicate all drought indices considered in this study have monitored heavy droughts during august in 2006 2011 and 2013 a iv a ⅴ and a ⅵ show heavy droughts during january in 2010 and 2014 and the observed drought intensity in august is higher than that in january in the northwest china the consistent drought trends can be observed in january and august which is reverse to the monthly drought trends observed in the a region b i b ii and b iii indicate all drought indices have monitored heavy droughts in this study during august in 2002 and 2014 in b region it can be seen from illustrations of b iv b ⅴ and b ⅵ that drought indices considered in this study also monitored heavy droughts in january during 2002 and 2014 which was consistent with the observed drought conditions in august generally the intensity of droughts occurred in august is greater than that in january in the northern china the similar drought tendency during january and august can be observed c i c ii and c iii indicate heavy droughts monitored by drought indices in august during 2002 and 2014 in this study c iv c ⅴ and c ⅵ indicate similar drought tendency in january and is similar to that in b region d i d ii and d iii indicate heavy droughts in d region in august during 2003 and 2006 d iv d ⅴ and d ⅵ indicate heavy droughts in january during 2014 by drought indices considered in this study in general the drought intensity in january is higher than that in august in general in august the northwest and north china or sub regions b and c are characterized by arid climate with similar drought tendency the d region is dominated by abundant precipitation with forest vegetation condition and subtropical monsoon climate more precipitation in summer than other seasons results in higher evapotranspiration and higher soil moisture in summer and hence summer difference in droughts nie et al 2008 in january significant difference in drought intensity can be observed in the tibet plateau when compared to that in other regions which should be attributed to high altitude of the tibet plateau and hence different climate types soil moisture conditions vegetation conditions and so on lai et al 2016 4 3 5 the results monitored by drought indices compared with crop yield and drought affected areas in order to further verify monitoring performance of the remote sensing based drought indices we compared the drought affected croplands monitored by psdi mrsdi gbmdi and the real world observed drought affected cropland areas the drought affected area overlays crop fields extracted the paddy field and dry land based on the land use and land cover lulc data in 2015 sun et al 2017 based on the extracted cropland areas annual cells areas of moderate severe and extreme drought were considered for the analysis of the drought affected areas in this study rivera and penalba 2014 then we compared the computed the drought affected croplands and the real world observed drought affected croplands since the land use data only include the paddy field and dry land without considering the croplands for other grain crops zhang et al 2017a the actual drought affected cropland area is generally higher than that monitored by drought indices we also compared the values of the drought indices during the growing season april october with the standardized crop yield the standardized crop yield was calculated by the average and the standard deviation of crop yield during from 2002 to 2016 du et al 2013 it can be seen from fig 11 a that larger than the real world observed drought affected croplands can be observed in 2002 2007 and 2009 reaching more than 250000 km2 the largest drought affected cropland areas monitored by mrsdi and gbmdi was found in 2002 2007 and 2009 and that by psdi was in 2002 and 2007 the correlation coefficient was 0 52 between the trend of the drought affected cropland areas monitored by psdi and the trend of real world observed drought affected cropland areas the correlation coefficient was 0 92 between the trend of the drought affected cropland areas monitored by mrsdi gbmdi and the trend of real world observed drought affected cropland areas therefore the trends of the drought affected cropland areas monitored by mrsdi and gbmdi is basically consistent with the real world observed drought affected cropland area which can basically monitor the real world observed drought affected cropland area the drought affected cropland by the psdi is slightly different from the real world observed drought affected cropland fig 11b indicates that given the real world observed drought affected croplands areas of 2 0 105 km2 during 2002 2003 2006 and 2009 percentage of the monitored drought affected croplands areas by mrsdi to the real world observed drought affected croplands areas is larger than that monitored by psdi to the real world observed drought affected croplands areas the difference in percentages by mrsdi and psdi can reach as large as 40 while given the real world observed drought affected croplands areas of 1 3 105 km2 during 2008 2014 2015 and 2016 percentage of the monitored drought affected croplands areas by mrsdi to the real world observed drought affected croplands areas is a little bit lower than that monitored by psdi to the real world observed drought affected croplands areas the difference in percentages by mrsdi and psdi can reach as large as 30 however except in 2003 2005 2012 and 2016 during all the other years percentage of the drought affected croplands areas monitored by gbmdi to the real world observed drought affected croplands areas is all larger than that monitored by psdi and mrsdi to the real world observed drought affected croplands areas the maximum difference in percentages monitored by mrsdi and gbmdi can reach 56 the maximum difference in percentages monitored by psdi and gbmdi can reach 55 in this case we can conclude that gbmdi performs much better than mrsdi and psdi in monitoring drought affected cropland areas furthermore we also compared the drought indices with standardized crop yield it can be seen from fig 11c that the gbmdi has the higher correlation coefficient with the standardized yield which is 0 77 and the result also passed p value 0 01 significant test therefore the gbmdi can be more adapted used to monitor agricultural drought than psdi and mrsdi 4 4 spatial pattern of drought frequency across china figs 12 15 indicate remarkable difference in spatial pattern of drought frequency monitored by mrsdi psdi and gbmdi respectively in winter which can be attributed to the spatial heterogeneity of the soil moisture in other seasons we can identify similar spatial pattern of drought frequency monitored by psdi mrsdi and gbmdi respectively as can be seen from fig 12 that seasonal drought frequency of the extreme droughts monitored by psdi is greater than that by mrsdi and gbmdi there are seasonal differences in the frequency of extreme droughts monitored by these three drought indices i e higher drought frequency of the extreme droughts can be observed in summer than in other seasons in terms of spatial distribution of drought frequency the areas with higher drought frequency of the extreme droughts concentrate mainly in the arid and semi arid regions while lower drought frequency of the extreme droughts can be found in regions in the vicinity of the river systems across china which can be due to the fact that higher density of river system may imply more convenient irrigation and easier access to water resources as can be seen from fig 13 that higher drought frequency of severe droughts monitored by mrsdi and gbmdi can be observed in summer and autumn than in other two seasons the frequency of severe droughts detected by psdi is in basically even distribution in the four seasons in terms of spatial distribution higher drought frequency of severe droughts can be found mainly in the northwestern china in the southwestern part of china the drought frequency of the severe droughts is relatively low which can be attributed mainly to higher density of water systems therefore convenient irrigation conditions and easy access to water resources greatly alleviate drought hazards it can be seen from fig 14 that the drought frequency of moderate droughts is in even spatial distribution in four seasons in autumn however the drought frequency of the moderate droughts monitored by mrsdi and gbmdi is generally higher than that by psdi in terms of spatial distribution in general we observed relatively high drought frequency of moderate droughts in all seasons in the xinjiang and the southeast china as can be seen from fig 15 that the drought frequency of the light droughts monitored by the mrsdi is higher than that by the psdi and gbmdi from seasonal perspective the drought frequency of the light droughts monitored by these three indices for each season is higher than that of the extreme droughts severe droughts and moderate droughts in addition from the spatial distribution perspective we can conclude that relatively higher drought frequency of the light droughts can be identified mainly in the northwest china generally lower drought frequency can be found in regions with high density of water systems where more convenient irrigation can be expected meanwhile relatively high drought frequency of severe and moderate droughts can be observed mainly in the northwest and southeast china where wheat and rice are the dominant crops therefore from the perspective of water resources management and regional water resources allocation more attention should be paid to areas with severe and moderate droughts 5 conclusions based on four drought monitoring indices i e vci pci smci and tci we obtained three integrated remote sensing drought monitoring indices i e psdi mrsdi and gbmdi to verify and compare monitoring performance of these three integrated drought indices at seasonal scale we compared drought monitoring results by psdi mrsdi and gbmdi and those by spei and spi based on in situ observed meteorological data besides based on the real world observed drought regimes and droughts monitored by drought indices we analyzed spatial pattern and temporal variations of drought regimes during 2002 2016 the aforementioned results helped us to obtain the following interesting and important findings and conclusions 1 we quantified relations between spei spi pdsi and the integrated drought indices i e psdi mrsdi and gbmdi we found positive correlations between drought indices and these relations are significant at 0 01 significance level meanwhile the results indicate that the proposed integrated drought monitoring indices and other indices can identify drought conditions in relatively consistency 2 to corroborate monitoring accuracy of the drought regimes by the psdi mrsdi and gbmdi at the monthly scale we compared the spatiotemporal variations and spatial distribution of typical drought events across china during 2002 2014 based on the monitoring results by psdi mrsdi and gbmdi we found that gbmdi can well describe the intensities and spatiotemporal patterns of droughts in a more accurate way than other integrated drought indices due to the uneven spatial distribution of soil moisture in china the drought tendency and drought intensity will also vary across different regions across china comparison of spi spei psdi mrsdi and gbmdi in monitoring the drought tendencies across four regions classified in this study during january and august indicated basically consistent monitoring results of the drought tendency meanwhile comparison of drought tendencies in different regions indicated similar drought tendency in the northwest and north china in addition the drought intensity in the south china in august is greater than that in january and the drought conditions are the opposite in other regions except south china 3 comparison between the real world observed drought affected croplands areas and those by integrated drought indices indicated that the trends of the drought affected cropland areas monitored by mrsdi and gbmdi is basically consistent with the real world observed drought affected cropland area meanwhile the percentage of the drought affected cropland areas monitored by gbmdi to the real world observed drought affected cropland area is higher than that by psdi and mrsdi besides the correlation between gbmdi and standardized crop yield is better than that of psdi and mrsdi therefore the gbmdi performs much better than mrsdi and psdi in monitoring agriculture drought 4 high drought frequency can be observed for the severe and moderate droughts across regions with high density of water system which will imply convenient agricultural irrigation and easy access to the water resources and therefore the alleviated droughts can be expected in this study we proposed new drought monitoring indices and provide alternative drought monitoring tools for large scale drought monitoring across china and also in other regions of the
