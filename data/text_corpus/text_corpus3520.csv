17600,a rational design of structure tailored and functionalized nanocarbons for peroxymonosulfate pms activation is important in metal free catalysis for degradation of water contaminants in this work we employed ionic liquids ils for synthesis of porous carbon materials pcms as a pms activator for oxidative removal of naproxen and systematically investigated the functions of structure defects oxygen functional groups and heteroatom doping toward the catalytic oxidation a positive linear correlation between reaction rate constants and carbon defect ratios of pcms revealed that the structural defects played an important role in pms activation electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra radical quenching experiments and electrochemical analysis tests verified nonradical dominated oxidations via electron transfer and 1o2 structural vacancies ketonic c o groups and graphitic n atoms on carbons have been revealed to be the active sites for the nonradical pathways via direct

abstract image graphical abstract keywords ionic liquids nonradical degradation pharmaceutical contaminants carbocatalysis peroxymonosulfate 1 introduction pharmaceutical contaminants have been frequently detected in water effluents which has aroused emerging concerns due to their ubiquity and potential hazardous effect on human health and the ecosystem patel et al 2019 verlicchi et al 2012 xu et al 2017 metal free activation of superoxides offers an effective and environmental friendly strategy to address this challenge by producing highly oxidizing radical or nonradical species to decompose refractory organics duan et al 2018b hodges et al 2018 oh et al 2016 notably nanocarbons e g graphene carbon nanotubes biochar with tunable physicochemical properties and desirable reactivity selectivity have been reported to effectively activate peroxymonosulfate pms for rapid decomposition of organic contaminants duan et al 2016 sun et al 2012 wang et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 their catalytic performances transcend many popular transition metals oxides attributed to the high specific surface areas ssas and highly conjugated sp2 framework functionalized with versatile catalytic centers for pms activation in distinct pathways dong et al 2019 hu et al 2017 shao et al 2018 nonradical oxidation was unveiled to be occurring on the catalyst surface region duan et al 2018a nanocarbons could mediate pms activation to generate singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide anion o2 and oxidative intermediates which were effective in a broad ph range resistant to versatile anions as well as background natural organic matters noms due to the moderate redox potential and good selectivity to target contaminants duan et al 2016 lee et al 2020 zhu et al 2018 it is highly desirable to fabricate engineered nanocarbons with abundant active sites to boost the nonradical oxidation nevertheless most of the carbocatalysts are constructed with various defects functional groups and doped heteroatoms and the intrinsic active sites accounting for the nonradical oxidation are still in debate duan et al 2018a luo et al 2019 shao et al 2018 therefore the structure performance relationships of the co existing catalytic centers in carbons for nonradical oxidation deserve further investigation ionic liquids ils with high thermal stability and negligible volatility have recently emerged as promising precursors for the development of functionalized nanocarbons watanabe et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 most ils are comprised of a nitrogen containing organic cation and an inorganic anion and il derived carbons with a high nitrogen content and graphitic degree exhibited even higher electronic conductivity than graphite paraknowitsch et al 2010 ranjbar sahraie et al 2014 she et al 2018 moreover the structural diversity of ils enables a rational control of the structure and properties of the resulting carbonaceous products which hold a great promise for versatile applications in catalysis such as oxygen reduction reaction orr oxygen evolution reaction oer and methanol oxidation gao et al 2015 gao et al 2017 jin et al 2014 macfarlane et al 2016 the synthesis processes may create varying degrees of structural defect while have a significant effect on the oxygen containing groups on nanocarbons gao et al 2019 which are expected to be functional in the catalytic activation of pms for nonradical oxidation however the impact of heteroatom doping on the defective structure oxygen groups of il derived carbons and their subsequent catalytic activities is not clear and it is highly desirable to gain mechanistic insights into heterogeneous catalysis of pms activation by il derived carbons as a guidance for designing novel catalytic materials with abundant active sites in this study porous carbons with engineered structures and functionalization were obtained by direct carbonization of ionic liquids with different anions hvim no3 hvim h2po4 and hvim hso4 naproxen was selected as a target contaminant because of its aqueous solubility and resistance to degradation which has been detected in different aquatic environments quesada et al 2019 santos et al 2007 the main objectives are to determine the structure property relationship of the il derived carbons in catalytic pms activation and to further identify the contributions of defective structure oxygen groups and heteroatom doping to the reaction mechanisms 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and chemicals oxone 2khso5 khso4 k2so4 pms and 1 vinylimidazole 99 were obtained from shanghai

2 sample preparation in a typical synthesis of n doped porous carbons n pc 0 1 mol hno3 was added dropwise to 0 1 mol 1 vinlimidazole with continuously stirring at room temperature gao et al 2019 then the mixture was maintained at 50 c for 2 h to form hydrolyzed vinyl imidazolium nitrate hvim no3 subsequently 2 g of the hvim no3 was annealed at 900 or 1000 c for 1 h in a tube furnace under nitrogen protection at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 the removal of the doped atoms under high temperature pyrolysis 900 1000 c contributes better to the generation of structural defects on the carbon basal plane jia et al 2016 the resulting samples were washed by deionized water several times and dried in an oven at 60 c overnight denoted as n pc900 and n pc1000 respectively for further p or s co doping hvim h2po4 and hvim hso4 were synthesized using a similar procedure as hvim no3 by replacing hno3 with 0 1 molar equivalent of h3po4 or h2so4 respectively afterwards p n co doped porous carbon p n pc and s n co doped porous carbon s n pc were obtained by pyrolysis of hvim h2po4 and hvim hso4 respectively at 1000 c for 1 h under nitrogen atmosphere 2 3 structural characterizations the structures and morphologies of the as prepared samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss g500 high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem and high angle annular dark field

emmett teller bet surface area and pore size distributions were evaluated by n2 adsorption desorption on a quantachrome autosorb iq c analyzer fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra were recorded in the range of 4000 1000 cm 1 using thermal nicolet ftir spectroscopy while n pc1000 after adsorption with naproxen was freeze dried before ftir characterization the open circuit potential of n pc1000 in different conditions was measured on an electrochemical workstation chi 760e using a saturated silver chloride electrode as the reference the intermediates and products of naproxen were identified by a bruker scion sq gaseous chromatograph mass spectroscopy gc ms system and a waters acquity uplc class i xevo g2q tof liquid chromatograph ms lc ms the details of electrochemical measurement and gc ms lc ms analysis were provided in the supporting information 2 4 adsorption and catalytic oxidation of organic pollutants naproxen oxidation was carried out by simultaneously introducing fixed amounts of pms 0 5 g l and catalyst 0 05 g l into the aqueous solution of naproxen 20 mg l 100 ml to initiate the reaction with constant stirring at 25 c periodically 0 5 ml solution was withdrawn by a pipette and mixed with 0 5 ml methanol to quench free radicals and then the mixture was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane the filtrate was analyzed on a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc thermal fisher u3000 using an agilent tc c18 column 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm under a uv detector at 220 nm the mobile phase consisted of 70 methanol and 30 phosphoric acid 0 2 wt at a flow rate of 1 1 ml min likewise adsorption experiments were conducted under the similar conditions to the catalytic processes without the addition of pms the water samples were withdrawn and analyzed at given time intervals and each measurement was conducted in duplicate for the stability test the used catalyst was washed with water and methanol for 3 times each after the test and then vacuum dried at 60 c the free radicals during the naproxen oxidation were trapped with dmpo or temp and identified by an electron spin resonance esr jes fa200 spectrometer the details of reactive species determination were described in the supporting information in addition different quenching agents including methanol p benzoquinone p bq nan3 ki and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso were used to determine the reactive species in the carbon pms system the role of dissolved oxygen do was also investigated by pre purging the naproxen solution with n2 before the addition of catalyst and pms beyond that other organic pollutants such as benzoic acid ba furfural ffa bisphenol a bpa ibuprofen and phenol were also employed to evaluate the catalytic performance of n pc1000 the physicochemical properties and analytical methods of these pollutants are provided in the supporting information natural water and tap water samples were used as water matrices to further evaluate the practical application of the aops the natural water sample was collected from pan lake in tianjin china and filtrated with a 0 45 μm membrane the total organic carbon toc contents of the aqueous samples were determined by a toc analyzer toc l cph shimadzu the analysis of solution ph and specific conductivity were performed at 25 c with a ph meter st3100 f ohaus and a conductivity meter fe30 mettler toledo respectively a summary of water parameters was listed in a table as inset of fig s13 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of porous carbon materials the morphologies of the porous carbon materials are characterized by sem and hrtem the sem images in fig 1 a c depict that n pc900 and n pc1000 present similar graphene like nanosheets in a porous framework tem images of n pc900 and n pc1000 in fig 1g and h further reveal their 3d hierarchically porous networks which could be ascribed to the released gases from decomposition of the nitrate group in hvim no3 during the pyrolysis gao et al 2018 gao et al 2017 fig 1d and e reveal the curved and rough surface of p n pc with small attached fragments which is supported by the tem images in fig 1i with curved and aggregated morphology sem fig 1f and tem fig 1j images present a flat sheet like structure with a great population of holes on the surface of s n pc in addition haadf stem images fig 1k display the homogeneous distributions of c n o atoms in n pc1000 indicating the successful incorporation of the heteroatoms into the carbon matrix as shown in fig 2 a c s1 3 and table 1 xps measurements reveal the surface elemental composition and chemical states of the as prepared samples the peaks of c 1s n 1s and o 1s were observed in the full xps surveys for all the samples the nitrogen in porous carbon materials pcms was originated from the carbonization of vinyl imidazole in ils notably the p 2p and s 2p peaks in p n pc and s n pc fig s3 respectively clearly indicated that dual heteroatom dopants could be incorporated into pcms during the pyrolysis deconvolution of the c 1s peak in fig s1 displayed a prominent peak at 284 7 ev referred to c c c c in addition to the other three peaks of c n 285 5 ev c o 286 7 ev and o c o 289 ev implying that the surface of pcms was highly hydrophobic with a conjugate π region surface nitrogen contents were measured to be 5 1 2 0 4 3 and 3 2 at in n pc900 n pc1000 p n pc and s n pc respectively an obvious decrease in n species was observed from n pc900 to n pc1000 fig 2b indicates the nitrogen dopants existed in the forms of graphitic 402 0 ev pyrrolic 400 7 ev and pyridinic 398 6 ev nitrogen pyrrolic n and pyridinic n were the main species in the as prepared samples fig 2c as they are mostly located at the edges of the graphitic carbon layer mao et al 2012 suggesting that directional n doping could be achieved by carbonization of ils which may have a great influence on their structures and properties fig s2 shows that the high resolution o 1s peaks of pcms could be deconvoluted into three components ketonic c o at 531 0 ev hydroxyl and epoxide c o at 532 1 ev and n o p o s o at 533 4 ev accordingly solís fernández et al 2012 yang et al 2019 the atomic ratios of c o to c o a c o a c o were calculated to be 1 0 1 2 0 7 and 0 3 for n pc900 n pc1000 p n pc and s n pc respectively suggesting that the precursors had a paramount impact on the content and category of oxygen containing groups in the derived pcms raman spectroscopy was employed to study the structural characteristics of the derived carbon materials the d band 1360 cm 1 and g band 1580 cm 1 can provide information on the imperfection and crystallinity of sp2 hybridized carbon respectively thus the intensity ratio of the d band and g band i d i g can be used to estimate the defective degree jia et al 2016 shen et al 2019 wang et al 2014 fig 2d and table 1 show the raman spectra and i d i g values of the as prepared pcms respectively and the i d i g values followed an order of n pc1000 1 01 n pc900 0 96 p n pc 0 94 s n pc 0 91 n pc1000 possessed a lower doping level but exhibited a higher defective degree suggesting that more structural defects such as vacancies edges and topologic defects may be generated on n pc1000 resulting from the removal of nitrogen during the thermal annealing jia et al 2016 p n or s n codoping seemed not to introduce more defect sites but the doped n atoms occupied the edge defects the bet surface area and porous structure of the obtained samples were characterized by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and the results are presented in fig s4 and table 1 all the pcms presented type i isotherms with a type ⅲ hysteresis loop a steep increase in the lower range of pressures was observed followed by a moderate increase at relatively high pressures indicating the formation of a hierarchically porous structure n pc900 displayed a high surface area of 1254 m2 g and a total pore volume of 0 69 cm3 g which were slightly lower than those of n pc1000 1418 m2 g 0 84 cm3 g but much higher than those of p n pc 358 m2 g 0 39 cm3 g and s n pc 834 m2 g 0 47 cm3 g these results indicate that the pcms were successfully obtained by carbonization of ils which is consistent with the sem and tem observations the pore size distribution using the barrett joyner halenda bjh method revealed that the pores of pcms were mainly distributed in a range of 0 4 nm n pc900 showed two prominent peaks at 1 47 and 2 42 nm respectively implying a hierarchically porous structure with rich micropores and mesopores in comparison with n pc900 an increased mesopore volume was found in n pc1000 ascribed to the merged micropores and enlarged pore size by the released gases at the elevated temperature considering that n pc1000 has a graphene like structure the hierarchical pores on the flat surface might facilitate the enrichment and diffusion of pollutants oxidants during the reaction in addition the higher bet surface area and total pore volume of s n pc compared with p n pc might be attributed to the release of so2 and o2 gases from hvim hso4 beneficial to the formation of micropores whereas h2po4 anion has inconspicuous pore forming effect during the pyrolysis gao et al 2018 these results suggested that the anion functional groups in ils played vital roles in preparation of pcms as both dopants and pore forming agents 3 2 adsorption and catalytic degradation of naproxen with heteroatom doping in hierarchically porous structure the developed pcms were evaluated for environmental applications as shown in fig 3 a n pc1000 exhibited the best performance in naproxen adsorption 52 0 followed by n pc900 49 4 s n pc 21 7 and p n pc 11 4 which is in accordance with the trend of their ssas furthermore the adsorption isotherms of naproxen for different pcms have been recorded and are shown in fig s5 the freundlich and langmuir models were used to fit the adsorption isotherms while the regression parameters are listed in table s2 generally all the isotherms were nonlinear the maximum adsorption capacities q max of naproxen were calculated by the langmuir model as 298 4 352 9 77 3 and 152 1 mg g for n pc900 n pc1000 p n pc and s n pc respectively the maximum adsorption capacity of n pc1000 352 9 mg g was even higher than that of mofs 93 171 mg g activated carbon 81 mg g and modified biochar 290 mg g jung et al 2015 onal et al 2007 sarker et al 2018 suggesting that the obtained pcms with a high ssa are promising for adsorptive elimination of aqueous contaminants for the molecular interaction between naproxen and pcms ftir spectra of n pc1000 before and after naproxen adsorption are presented in fig s6a as discussed above the surface of n pc1000 is highly hydrophobic with abundant conjugate π regions on the plane the peak corresponding to the skeleton vibration of c c bond shifted from 1565 to 1557 cm 1 after the adsorption of naproxen onto n pc1000 implying that high affinity of naproxen for n pc1000 was dominated by the powerful π π interaction with the π conjugated carbon surface shen and chen 2015 wang et al 2014 moreover fig s6b reveals that q max values were positively and linearly correlated with the ssa of pcms indicating that the porous structure could provide abundant adsorption sites for organic pollutants which facilitated the mass transfer and π π interactions li et al 2019 wang and chen 2015 wang et al 2016 moreover pore filling typically occurs in organic pollutant adsorption on porous carbons considering the rich microporosity of pcms and the large molecular size 12 å of naproxen pore filling and nanosize effect may play important roles because the accessibility of adsorption sites on il derived carbons for naproxen is different sun et al 2019 wang et al 2014 for example naproxen adsorption isotherms of n pc900 and n pc1000 are better fitted by the freundlich and langmuir models respectively the fittings indicate that n pc900 has a wider adsorption site distribution than that of n pc1000 due to its heterogeneous surface which is consistent with the porosity analysis as previously reported carbon based materials often have fragments containing aromatic substances during the incomplete low temperature pyrolysis in this work most of aromatic fragments were decomposed or fabricated into the bulk carbon matrix under thermal annealing at 1000 c even if minor amount of residuals remains on the surface of highly graphitic carbons the strong π π interaction will confine these fragments and prevent them to be released to water to avoid secondary pollution chen and chen 2016 zhang et al 2019 in advanced oxidation processes pms alone can only cause 15 7 of naproxen oxidation in 120 min without a catalyst fig 3b when n pc900 pms was introduced into the solution the naproxen removal reached 84 0 in 120 min a complete naproxen removal was achieved in 30 min for the n pc1000 pms system while 49 6 toc removal was attained in 120 min demonstrating that the mineralization efficiency by the n pc1000 pms system is moderate in contrast p n pc and s n pc could achieve 58 4 and 30 7 of naproxen removal in 120 min respectively these observations suggest that dual doping on pcms might not be favorable for pms activation and naproxen degradation duan et al 2015 fig s7 and table s3 further displayed the rate constants k fitted by the first order kinetic model the k values for n pc900 n pc1000 p n pc and s n pc were estimated to be 0 037 0 175 0 017 and 0 009 min 1 respectively n pc1000 exhibited much higher reaction rate constant than other pcms suggesting that the highly porous structure and high surface area of n pc1000 are also beneficial for the catalytic reaction by exposing more active sites and transport channels wang et al 2019 fig 3c displays the effect of reaction temperature on naproxen degradation on n pc1000 not surprisingly an elevated reaction temperature resulted in an improved naproxen removal efficiency because higher temperature can simultaneously speed up the kinetics and pms activation an endothermic process based on the arrhenius equation the activation energy ea of n pc1000 for naproxen oxidation was calculated to be 19 0 kj mol which was lower than that of n doped graphene aerogel for ibuprofen degradation 87 5 kj mol n doped carbon nanotubes for phenol degradation 39 2 kj mol and co based porous carbon for p hba degradation 44 5 kj mol sun et al 2014 tian et al 2018 wang et al 2019 fig 3d displayed the recycling performance of n pc1000 complete naproxen degradations were achieved in 30 60 and 120 min for the 1st 2nd and 3rd runs respectively and 89 0 of naproxen could be removed in the 4th run the results indicated that the catalytic performance of n pc1000 was gradually deteriorated in successive catalytic reactions the deteriorated activity possibly stemmed from the altered surface chemistry in the oxidative environment as well as the coverage of active sites by the adsorbed naproxen and intermediates duan et al 2015 duan et al 2018b to probe the origins of the superior catalytic performances of pcms we made quantitative analysis between the naproxen degradation rate in a log scale log k and the structural parameters of pcms fig 4 as mentioned above a positive linear correlation r 2 0 91 has been established between the q max values and the ssa of pcms ideally the greater adsorption capacity could allow more target organics to participate in the catalytic reaction near the surface region of the carbocatalysts thereby enhancing the catalytic activity wang et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 however fig 4a indicates that the log k values were not positively correlated with the ssa of pcms s n pc possessed a higher ssa 834 m2 g and adsorption capacity than p n pc but s n pc manifested an inferior log k value in contrast n pc1000 exhibited a similar ssa to n pc900 but displayed a much higher log k value over n pc900 the results suggested that the catalytic activity of the carbocatalysts was not simply relying on the adsorption capacity but on the intrinsic configurations of carbons and heteroatom dopants as well as the optimized electronic structure of the catalytic sites for pms activation therefore the relationships between the structure and catalytic activity of pcms in pms adsorption and catalytic oxidation should be further investigated it was suggested that the ketonic c o groups on nanocarbons are rich in electrons which play an important role in pms activation for advanced oxidation duan et al 2016 shao et al 2018 herein we correlated the log k values to the ratios of a c o a c o in fig 4b the log k values increased with increasing ratios of a c o a c o while an obvious jump was observed for n pc1000 the ketonic groups can contribute to the performance of pcms in catalytic oxidation however this might not be the decisive factor additionally nitrogen doping has been illustrated to tailor the charge distribution of the sp2 hybridized carbons which can improve the catalytic activity in pms activation duan et al 2015 hu et al 2017 kang et al 2018 nevertheless fig 4c indicates that n pc1000 possessed the lowest n content and showed the highest log k value and that the contents of different n species in n pc1000 were the lowest in pcms fig 2c therefore the nitrogen dopants might not be the primary active sites on pcms in a recent study it was observed that a lower nitrogen content in carbon would lead to a higher activity in oxygen reduction reaction orr jia et al 2016 moreover by removing the n atoms under thermal pyrolysis the activities of the obtained defective carbons for orr oxygen evolution reaction oer and hydrogen evolution reaction her were much improved compared to the original n doped graphene jiang et al 2019 yan et al 2018 this was attributed to the fact that the thermal decomposition of the nitrogen atoms could result in the formation of defective sites vacancies and topological defects which were believed to exhibit higher catalytic activities the defect degree of pcms can be evaluated by the i d i g ratios from the raman spectra notably fig 4d displays a positive correlation between the log k values and the i d i g ratios of pcms r 2 0 99 indicating that the higher defective degree of pcms would give rise to the enhanced catalytic performance furthermore the hrtem images in fig s8 were used to visualize the fine structure of pcms for n pc900 and n pc1000 many non hexagonal carbon rings in pentagons and heptagons were identified in fig s8a and b suggesting the formation of defective domains throughout the carbon lattice in contrary clear crystal lattices were spotted in p n pc and s n pc with a d spacing of 0 21 nm whereas fewer vacant sites could be observed implying that heteroatoms co doping decreased the defect sites the hrtem observations were consistent with the raman spectra and the newly created structural defects might play a dominant role in catalytic pms activation and naproxen degradation 3 3 catalytic mechanisms pms can be activated by metal or metal free catalysts to produce highly reactive oxygen species ros for degradation of organic pollutants oh et al 2016 wang and wang 2018 to elucidate the catalytic mechanism in pcms pms system we conducted quenching tests using methanol meoh pms 500 as the radical scavenger because it could quickly scavenge both so4 kso4 3 2 106 m 1s 1 and oh k oh 9 7 108 m 1s 1 as shown in fig 5 a the impact of meoh on naproxen degradation by n pc900 n pc1000 p n pc and s n pc was insignificant taking n pc1000 as a representative further increasing meoh from 500 1 to 1000 1 or completely replacing the solvent from water to meoh posed a limited effect on the naproxen oxidation fig s9a suggesting that the naproxen oxidation might not rely on free radicals in the pcms pms system duan et al 2016 epr tests were employed to monitor the radical evolution during naproxen degradation using dmpo as the spin trapping agent as illustrated in fig s9b the specific signals of both so4 and oh were not detected which further confirmed that the free radicals did not account for the oxidation and other nonradical ros might be generated in the system previous studies revealed that singlet oxygen 1o2 could be generated from pms activation by ketonic groups and n doped carbon liang et al 2017 luo et al 2019 wang et al 2017 herein epr tests were carried out using 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp as the spin trapping agent to probe the existence of 1o2 fig 5b shows that characteristic triplet signals 1 1 1 were observed in the presence of pms and n pc1000 which were ascribed to the oxidized temp by 1o2 moreover the intensities of the signals increased rapidly in the first 20 min fig 5c and then declined gradually due to the substantial consumption of 1o2 by naproxen sodium azido nan3 as an effective scavenger of 1o2 k 1o2 1 0 109 m 1s 1 was also used in the quenching tests to further reveal the role of 1o2 as shown in fig 5d nan3 12 mm retarded the naproxen degradation from 98 8 to 57 4 in 30 min considering that the first order decay constant of 1o2 is 2 5 105 s 1 nan3 should decrease the degradation rate by 6 times the actual inhibition is not substantial thus 1o2 may play a significant role but it is certainly not the only reactive species involved in naproxen degradation in addition benzoic acid ba and furfuryl alcohol ffa were applied as the probe compounds for oh and 1o2 respectively shao et al 2018 as presented in fig s10a a complete oxidation of ffa was attained in the n pc1000 pms system while only 16 2 of ba was degraded the distinctive degradation performances for the different compounds further verified that 1o2 was present besides lower graphitic n content and a c o a c o ratio were obtained for the used n pc1000 as reflected by the xps spectra figs s11a c the results indicated that the ketonic groups and graphitic n atoms were consumed during the reaction which might be beneficial to the generation of 1o2 in pms system since pyrrole n and pyridinic n were the main species on pcms and the n species are mostly located at the edge n doping did not substantially contribute to the overall activity superoxide anion radical o2 might be generated to participate in the oxidation or 1o2 production via recombination with h2o cheng et al 2017 li et al 2015 p bq as an effective o2 scavenger was employed to determine the contribution of o2 to naproxen degradation the degradation efficiency was significantly inhibited by the addition of p bq 12 mm only 45 5 of naproxen was degraded over n pc1000 in 30 min fig 5d suggesting that o2 was generated in the n pc1000 pms system previous studies reported that the oxygen vacancies ovs on the surface of the metal oxides would induce abundant localized electrons which could facilitate the electron transfer to o2 to produce o2 qin et al 2018 likewise the electron rich ketonic groups on n pc1000 might also serve as basic lewis sites for o2 production cheng et al 2019 to verify the speculation we examined the effect of dissolved oxygen on the naproxen oxidation in the n pc1000 pms system fig s10b revealed that the naproxen degradation rate declined from 0 175 to 0 107 min 1 under continuous n2 purging suggesting that the dissolved oxygen participated in the generation of o2 1o2 for naproxen oxidation and that other reactive species different from ros should also be responsible for the reaction since o2 1o2 has a mild oxidation potential e0 o2 1o2 0 81 vnhe the reactions based on these reactive species might suffer from a low mineralization efficiency but benefit from their substrate specific reactivity and high selectivity in real water treatment lee et al 2020 furthermore dmso and ki were used to quench the surface bounded reactive species in the n pc1000 pms system the degradation efficiency of naproxen declined from 98 8 to 81 5 and 48 1 in 30 min in the presence of dmso 12 mm and ki 12 mm respectively since i can exert a shielding effect to prohibit the interactions between organic molecules and the carbon matrix zhu et al 2018 the moderate impeding effects of dmso and ki suggested that the surface activated ros should be partially responsible for the oxidation notably emerging nonradical oxidation was discovered in the n pc1000 pms system as none of the quenching agents could completely terminate the reaction moreover electrochemical techniques were employed to investigate the nonradical reaction as shown in fig 6 a the open circuit potential of glassy carbon electrode gce with n pc1000 coating n pc1000 gce rose immediately after pms addition while the potential decreased markedly upon the presence of naproxen it was speculated that the activation of pms to form a n pc1000 pms complex could elevate the potential of n pc1000 and that the decreased potential with the presence of naproxen further indicated the electron transfer process from naproxen as the electron donor ren et al 2019a b in contrast the potential of n pc1000 gce electrode without pms addition did not show any obvious variation fig 6b implying that the electron transfer process occurred on the n pc1000 pms system it was suggested that the defective sites on the carbon network were the active centers to mediate pms activation to form a highly reactive complex for nonradical oxidation duan et al 2016 in this work the hrtem witnessed many non hexagonal carbon rings on the n pc surface as the defective sites which was attributed to subtraction of nitrogen atoms under high temperature resulting in the formation of vacant sites jia et al 2016 the defective sites were able to confine the delocalized π system with a localized state showing completely different chemical and electronic properties and being highly active duan et al 2016 as discussed above it was confirmed that π π interaction played an important role in naproxen adsorption on the carbon surface the strong interaction between defective sites and pollutants enabled the pms molecules to oxidize contaminants directly via extracting electrons from adsorbed organics without generating free radicals duan et al 2016 moreover a higher defective degree of pcms gave rise to an improved organic removal efficiency while fig s11d also illustrates that the used n pc1000 had a smaller i d i g 0 98 value in comparison to the fresh sample which verified the consumption of the structural defects during the pms activation given that the structural defects graphitic n atoms and ketonic c o groups on n pc1000 were the active sites for direct electron transfer and generation of o2 1o2 there were three pathways for naproxen degradation by the n pc1000 pms system i pollutants were oxidized by adsorption on the carbon lattice and donating electrons to the vacant sites that activate pms to form highly reactive complexes ii partial pms molecules were oxidized around graphitic n atoms and ketonic c o groups to produce 1o2 for pollutant degradation iii the electron rich c o groups transferred electrons to o2 to produce o2 either participating in the oxidation or producing 1o2 via combination with water by comparison with other conventional catalysts such as n doped reduced graphene oxide n rgo multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnt co3o4 and α mno2 in fig s12a n pc1000 well outperformed the other catalysts in naproxen oxidation pre experiments and parallel tests indicated that the il derived carbons could be manufactured in a large scale with well defined structures the cost of hvim no3 is about 80 kg while the presumed cost of il derived carbon is 2 g which is comparatively lower than that of carbon nanotubes 5 200 g and graphene 10 500 g for naproxen at 20 mg l 1 g n pc1000 could purify more than 80 l of polluted water and even a larger volume with low concentration contaminants based on the adsorption isotherm and degradation curves it was speculated that naproxen at a trace level in real water matrix 1 mg l could be efficiently enriched on the carbon surface and rapidly decomposed by the oxidative system fig s12b revealed that n pc1000 pms system was also effective in degradation of other organic pollutants the removal efficiencies for bpa phenol and ibuprofen were 81 5 89 4 and 95 5 respectively in 120 min in addition naproxen degradation by n pc1000 pms system was further evaluated using natural water and tap water samples as water matrices fig s13 though abundant natural organic matters noms or chloride ions occur in the water samples 99 5 and 81 1 naproxen removals were attained in 45 min in the natural water and tap water samples respectively demonstrating that the n pc1000 pms system benefits from minimal interference of background noms ions and high selectivity toward oxidation of naproxen as shown in fig s14 hplc spectra monitored the generation and evolution of the intermediates during naproxen oxidation meanwhile gc ms with electron ionization ei and lc ms with electron spray ionization esi were applied to detect the by products and to reveal the degradation pathways of naproxen two main compounds were detected by hplc which were identified as 1 acetyl 6 methoxynaphthalene and 6 methoxy 2 vinylnaphthalene by gc ms with the mass of 200 23 and 184 23 respectively lc ms spectra shown in fig s16 further detected seven intermediates with m z of 134 184 200 218 235 261 and 339 the identification of the intermediates revealed that naproxen oxidation was initiated by the hydroxylation of the methyl position of naproxen followed by subsequent hydroxylation and demethylation chi et al 2019 coria et al 2016 even though oh was barely detected in the n pc1000 pms system hydroxylation can also take place via direct electron transfer and then react with water additionally naproxen could be oxidized by direct addition of hydroxyl groups on the naphthalene ring hou et al 2020 which could be further oxidized to the ring opening products as well as co2 and h2o the degradation pathways of naproxen by the n pc1000 pms system were proposed in fig 7 4 conclusions in summary porous carbon materials were prepared via one pot thermal pyrolysis using ils as carbon and dopant precursors it was found that n doping or dual doping on pcms might not be favorable for pms activation and naproxen degradation as they occupy the defects and edges instead a higher defective degree of pcms gave rise to an improved organic removal efficiency the derived n pc1000 manifested the highest catalytic performance in pms activation for naproxen oxidation the 3d porous structure with abundant defective sites ketonic c o groups and graphitic n doped atoms on n pc1000 synergistically facilitated the redox reactions during pms activation it was revealed that the defective domains were the active centers for pms activation to induce activated pms carbon complexes for nonradical oxidation while ketonic c o groups and n doped atoms contributed better to the generation of 1o2 o2 in pms system this study offers a novel protocol for fabricating an efficient carbocatalyst for water purification and contributes to a better understanding of the heterogeneous pms activation by defect based nonradical carbocatalysis

17600,a rational design of structure tailored and functionalized nanocarbons for peroxymonosulfate pms activation is important in metal free catalysis for degradation of water contaminants in this work we employed ionic liquids ils for synthesis of porous carbon materials pcms as a pms activator for oxidative removal of naproxen and systematically investigated the functions of structure defects oxygen functional groups and heteroatom doping toward the catalytic oxidation a positive linear correlation between reaction rate constants and carbon defect ratios of pcms revealed that the structural defects played an important role in pms activation electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra radical quenching experiments and electrochemical analysis tests verified nonradical dominated oxidations via electron transfer and 1o2 structural vacancies ketonic c o groups and graphitic n atoms on carbons have been revealed to be the active sites for the nonradical pathways via direct electron transfer or generation of o2 1o2 this work provides new insight into the reaction mechanism and structure performance relationships of the catalytic centers in nonradical oxidation graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ionic liquids nonradical degradation pharmaceutical contaminants carbocatalysis peroxymonosulfate 1 introduction pharmaceutical contaminants have been frequently detected in water effluents which has aroused emerging concerns due to their ubiquity and potential hazardous effect on human health and the ecosystem patel et al 2019 verlicchi et al 2012 xu et al 2017 metal free activation of superoxides offers an effective and environmental friendly strategy to address this challenge by producing highly oxidizing radical or nonradical species to decompose refractory organics duan et al 2018b hodges et al 2018 oh et al 2016 notably nanocarbons e g graphene carbon nanotubes biochar with tunable physicochemical properties and desirable reactivity selectivity have been reported to effectively activate peroxymonosulfate pms for rapid decomposition of organic contaminants duan et al 2016 sun et al 2012 wang et al 2019 zhu et al 2018 their catalytic performances transcend many popular transition metals oxides attributed to the high specific surface areas ssas and highly conjugated sp2 framework functionalized with versatile catalytic centers for pms activation in distinct pathways dong et al 2019 hu et al 2017 shao et al 2018 nonradical oxidation was unveiled to be occurring on the catalyst surface region duan et al 2018a nanocarbons could mediate pms activation to generate singlet oxygen 1o2 superoxide anion o2 and oxidative intermediates which were effective in a broad ph range resistant to versatile anions as well as background natural organic matters noms due to the moderate redox potential and good selectivity to target contaminants duan et al 2016 lee et al 2020 zhu et al 2018 it is highly desirable to fabricate engineered nanocarbons with abundant active sites to boost the nonradical oxidation nevertheless most of the carbocatalysts are constructed with various defects functional groups and doped heteroatoms and the intrinsic active sites accounting for the nonradical oxidation are still in debate duan et al 2018a luo et al 2019 shao et al 2018 therefore the structure performance relationships of the co existing catalytic centers in carbons for nonradical oxidation deserve further investigation ionic liquids ils with high thermal stability and negligible volatility have recently emerged as promising precursors for the development of functionalized nanocarbons watanabe et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 most ils are comprised of a nitrogen containing organic cation and an inorganic anion and il derived carbons with a high nitrogen content and graphitic degree exhibited even higher electronic conductivity than graphite paraknowitsch et al 2010 ranjbar sahraie et al 2014 she et al 2018 moreover the structural diversity of ils enables a rational control of the structure and properties of the resulting carbonaceous products which hold a great promise for versatile applications in catalysis such as oxygen reduction reaction orr oxygen evolution reaction oer and methanol oxidation gao et al 2015 gao et al 2017 jin et al 2014 macfarlane et al 2016 the synthesis processes may create varying degrees of structural defect while have a significant effect on the oxygen containing groups on nanocarbons gao et al 2019 which are expected to be functional in the catalytic activation of pms for nonradical oxidation however the impact of heteroatom doping on the defective structure oxygen groups of il derived carbons and their subsequent catalytic activities is not clear and it is highly desirable to gain mechanistic insights into heterogeneous catalysis of pms activation by il derived carbons as a guidance for designing novel catalytic materials with abundant active sites in this study porous carbons with engineered structures and functionalization were obtained by direct carbonization of ionic liquids with different anions hvim no3 hvim h2po4 and hvim hso4 naproxen was selected as a target contaminant because of its aqueous solubility and resistance to degradation which has been detected in different aquatic environments quesada et al 2019 santos et al 2007 the main objectives are to determine the structure property relationship of the il derived carbons in catalytic pms activation and to further identify the contributions of defective structure oxygen groups and heteroatom doping to the reaction mechanisms 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and chemicals oxone 2khso5 khso4 k2so4 pms and 1 vinylimidazole 99 were obtained from shanghai macklin biochemical co ltd naproxen 99 ibuprofen 98 phenol 99 bisphenol a 99 5 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline dmpo 97 0 and 4 amino 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp 98 were provided by aladdin chemistry

2 sample preparation in a typical synthesis of n doped porous carbons n pc 0 1 mol hno3 was added dropwise to 0 1 mol 1 vinlimidazole with continuously stirring at room temperature gao et al 2019 then the mixture was maintained at 50 c for 2 h to form hydrolyzed vinyl imidazolium nitrate hvim no3 subsequently 2 g of the hvim no3 was annealed at 900 or 1000 c for 1 h in a tube furnace under nitrogen protection at a heating rate of 5 c min 1 the removal of the doped atoms under high temperature pyrolysis 900 1000 c contributes better to the generation of structural defects on the carbon basal plane jia et al 2016 the resulting samples were washed by deionized water several times and dried in an oven at 60 c overnight denoted as n pc900 and n pc1000 respectively for further p or s co doping hvim h2po4 and hvim hso4 were synthesized using a similar procedure as hvim no3 by replacing hno3 with 0 1 molar equivalent of h3po4 or h2so4 respectively afterwards p n co doped porous carbon p n pc and s n co doped porous carbon s n pc were obtained by pyrolysis of hvim h2po4 and hvim hso4 respectively at 1000 c for 1 h under nitrogen atmosphere 2 3 structural characterizations the structures and morphologies of the as prepared samples were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss g500 high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem and high angle annular dark field

emmett teller bet surface area and pore size distributions were evaluated by n2 adsorption desorption on a quantachrome autosorb iq c analyzer fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra were recorded in the range of 4000 1000 cm 1 using thermal nicolet ftir spectroscopy while n pc1000 after adsorption with naproxen was freeze dried before ftir characterization the open circuit potential of n pc1000 in different conditions was measured on an electrochemical workstation chi 760e using a saturated silver chloride electrode as the reference the intermediates and products of naproxen were identified by a bruker scion sq gaseous chromatograph mass spectroscopy gc ms system and a waters acquity uplc class i xevo g2q tof liquid chromatograph ms lc ms the details of electrochemical measurement and gc ms lc ms analysis were provided in the supporting information 2 4 adsorption and catalytic oxidation of organic pollutants naproxen oxidation was carried out by simultaneously introducing fixed amounts of pms 0 5 g l and catalyst 0 05 g l into the aqueous solution of naproxen 20 mg l 100 ml to initiate the reaction with constant stirring at 25 c periodically 0 5 ml solution was withdrawn by a pipette and mixed with 0 5 ml methanol to quench free radicals and then the mixture was filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane the filtrate was analyzed on a high performance liquid chromatograph hplc thermal fisher u3000 using an agilent tc c18 column 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm under a uv detector at 220 nm the mobile phase consisted of 70 methanol and 30 phosphoric acid 0 2 wt at a flow rate of 1 1 ml min likewise adsorption experiments were conducted under the similar conditions to the catalytic processes without the addition of pms the water samples were withdrawn and analyzed at given time intervals and each measurement was conducted in duplicate for the stability test the used catalyst was washed with water and methanol for 3 times each after the test and then vacuum dried at 60 c the free radicals during the naproxen oxidation were trapped with dmpo or temp and identified by an electron spin resonance esr jes fa200 spectrometer the details of reactive species determination were described in the supporting information in addition different quenching agents including methanol p benzoquinone p bq nan3 ki and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso were used to determine the reactive species in the carbon pms system the role of dissolved oxygen do was also investigated by pre purging the naproxen solution with n2 before the addition of catalyst and pms beyond that other organic pollutants such as benzoic acid ba furfural ffa bisphenol a bpa ibuprofen and phenol were also employed to evaluate the catalytic performance of n pc1000 the physicochemical properties and analytical methods of these pollutants are provided in the supporting information natural water and tap water samples were used as water matrices to further evaluate the practical application of the aops the natural water sample was collected from pan lake in tianjin china and filtrated with a 0 45 μm membrane the total organic carbon toc contents of the aqueous samples were determined by a toc analyzer toc l cph shimadzu the analysis of solution ph and specific conductivity were performed at 25 c with a ph meter st3100 f ohaus and a conductivity meter fe30 mettler toledo respectively a summary of water parameters was listed in a table as inset of fig s13 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of porous carbon materials the morphologies of the porous carbon materials are characterized by sem and hrtem the sem images in fig 1 a c depict that n pc900 and n pc1000 present similar graphene like nanosheets in a porous framework tem images of n pc900 and n pc1000 in fig 1g and h further reveal their 3d hierarchically porous networks which could be ascribed to the released gases from decomposition of the nitrate group in hvim no3 during the pyrolysis gao et al 2018 gao et al 2017 fig 1d and e reveal the curved and rough surface of p n pc with small attached fragments which is supported by the tem images in fig 1i with curved and aggregated morphology sem fig 1f and tem fig 1j images present a flat sheet like structure with a great population of holes on the surface of s n pc in addition haadf stem images fig 1k display the homogeneous distributions of c n o atoms in n pc1000 indicating the successful incorporation of the heteroatoms into the carbon matrix as shown in fig 2 a c s1 3 and table 1 xps measurements reveal the surface elemental composition and chemical states of the as prepared samples the peaks of c 1s n 1s and o 1s were observed in the full xps surveys for all the samples the nitrogen in porous carbon materials pcms was originated from the carbonization of vinyl imidazole in ils notably the p 2p and s 2p peaks in p n pc and s n pc fig s3 respectively clearly indicated that dual heteroatom dopants could be incorporated into pcms during the pyrolysis deconvolution of the c 1s peak in fig s1 displayed a prominent peak at 284 7 ev referred to c c c c in addition to the other three peaks of c n 285 5 ev c o 286 7 ev and o c o 289 ev implying that the surface of pcms was highly hydrophobic with a conjugate π region surface nitrogen contents were measured to be 5 1 2 0 4 3 and 3 2 at in n pc900 n pc1000 p n pc and s n pc respectively an obvious decrease in n species was observed from n pc900 to n pc1000 fig 2b indicates the nitrogen dopants existed in the forms of graphitic 402 0 ev pyrrolic 400 7 ev and pyridinic 398 6 ev nitrogen pyrrolic n and pyridinic n were the main species in the as prepared samples fig 2c as they are mostly located at the edges of the graphitic carbon layer mao et al 2012 suggesting that directional n doping could be achieved by carbonization of ils which may have a great influence on their structures and properties fig s2 shows that the high resolution o 1s peaks of pcms could be deconvoluted into three components ketonic c o at 531 0 ev hydroxyl and epoxide c o at 532 1 ev and n o p o s o at 533 4 ev accordingly solís fernández et al 2012 yang et al 2019 the atomic ratios of c o to c o a c o a c o were calculated to be 1 0 1 2 0 7 and 0 3 for n pc900 n pc1000 p n pc and s n pc respectively suggesting that the precursors had a paramount impact on the content and category of oxygen containing groups in the derived pcms raman spectroscopy was employed to study the structural characteristics of the derived carbon materials the d band 1360 cm 1 and g band 1580 cm 1 can provide information on the imperfection and crystallinity of sp2 hybridized carbon respectively thus the intensity ratio of the d band and g band i d i g can be used to estimate the defective degree jia et al 2016 shen et al 2019 wang et al 2014 fig 2d and table 1 show the raman spectra and i d i g values of the as prepared pcms respectively and the i d i g values followed an order of n pc1000 1 01 n pc900 0 96 p n pc 0 94 s n pc 0 91 n pc1000 possessed a lower doping level but exhibited a higher defective degree suggesting that more structural defects such as vacancies edges and topologic defects may be generated on n pc1000 resulting from the removal of nitrogen during the thermal annealing jia et al 2016 p n or s n codoping seemed not to introduce more defect sites but the doped n atoms occupied the edge defects the bet surface area and porous structure of the obtained samples were characterized by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and the results are presented in fig s4 and table 1 all the pcms presented type i isotherms with a type ⅲ hysteresis loop a steep increase in the lower range of pressures was observed followed by a moderate increase at relatively high pressures indicating the formation of a hierarchically porous structure n pc900 displayed a high surface area of 1254 m2 g and a total pore volume of 0 69 cm3 g which were slightly lower than those of n pc1000 1418 m2 g 0 84 cm3 g but much higher than those of p n pc 358 m2 g 0 39 cm3 g and s n pc 834 m2 g 0 47 cm3 g these results indicate that the pcms were successfully obtained by carbonization of ils which is consistent with the sem and tem observations the pore size distribution using the barrett joyner halenda bjh method revealed that the pores of pcms were mainly distributed in a range of 0 4 nm n pc900 showed two prominent peaks at 1 47 and 2 42 nm respectively implying a hierarchically porous structure with rich micropores and mesopores in comparison with n pc900 an increased mesopore volume was found in n pc1000 ascribed to the merged micropores and enlarged pore size by the released gases at the elevated temperature considering that n pc1000 has a graphene like structure the hierarchical pores on the flat surface might facilitate the enrichment and diffusion of pollutants oxidants during the reaction in addition the higher bet surface area and total pore volume of s n pc compared with p n pc might be attributed to the release of so2 and o2 gases from hvim hso4 beneficial to the formation of micropores whereas h2po4 anion has inconspicuous pore forming effect during the pyrolysis gao et al 2018 these results suggested that the anion functional groups in ils played vital roles in preparation of pcms as both dopants and pore forming agents 3 2 adsorption and catalytic degradation of naproxen with heteroatom doping in hierarchically porous structure the developed pcms were evaluated for environmental applications as shown in fig 3 a n pc1000 exhibited the best performance in naproxen adsorption 52 0 followed by n pc900 49 4 s n pc 21 7 and p n pc 11 4 which is in accordance with the trend of their ssas furthermore the adsorption isotherms of naproxen for different pcms have been recorded and are shown in fig s5 the freundlich and langmuir models were used to fit the adsorption isotherms while the regression parameters are listed in table s2 generally all the isotherms were nonlinear the maximum adsorption capacities q max of naproxen were calculated by the langmuir model as 298 4 352 9 77 3 and 152 1 mg g for n pc900 n pc1000 p n pc and s n pc respectively the maximum adsorption capacity of n pc1000 352 9 mg g was even higher than that of mofs 93 171 mg g activated carbon 81 mg g and modified biochar 290 mg g jung et al 2015 onal et al 2007 sarker et al 2018 suggesting that the obtained pcms with a high ssa are promising for adsorptive elimination of aqueous contaminants for the molecular interaction between naproxen and pcms ftir spectra of n pc1000 before and after naproxen adsorption are presented in fig s6a as discussed above the surface of n pc1000 is highly hydrophobic with abundant conjugate π regions on the plane the peak corresponding to the skeleton vibration of c c bond shifted from 1565 to 1557 cm 1 after the adsorption of naproxen onto n pc1000 implying that high affinity of naproxen for n pc1000 was dominated by the powerful π π interaction with the π conjugated carbon surface shen and chen 2015 wang et al 2014 moreover fig s6b reveals that q max values were positively and linearly correlated with the ssa of pcms indicating that the porous structure could provide abundant adsorption sites for organic pollutants which facilitated the mass transfer and π π interactions li et al 2019 wang and chen 2015 wang et al 2016 moreover pore filling typically occurs in organic pollutant adsorption on porous carbons considering the rich microporosity of pcms and the large molecular size 12 å of naproxen pore filling and nanosize effect may play important roles because the accessibility of adsorption sites on il derived carbons for naproxen is different sun et al 2019 wang et al 2014 for example naproxen adsorption isotherms of n pc900 and n pc1000 are better fitted by the freundlich and langmuir models respectively the fittings indicate that n pc900 has a wider adsorption site distribution than that of n pc1000 due to its heterogeneous surface which is consistent with the porosity analysis as previously reported carbon based materials often have fragments containing aromatic substances during the incomplete low temperature pyrolysis in this work most of aromatic fragments were decomposed or fabricated into the bulk carbon matrix under thermal annealing at 1000 c even if minor amount of residuals remains on the surface of highly graphitic carbons the strong π π interaction will confine these fragments and prevent them to be released to water to avoid secondary pollution chen and chen 2016 zhang et al 2019 in advanced oxidation processes pms alone can only cause 15 7 of naproxen oxidation in 120 min without a catalyst fig 3b when n pc900 pms was introduced into the solution the naproxen removal reached 84 0 in 120 min a complete naproxen removal was achieved in 30 min for the n pc1000 pms system while 49 6 toc removal was attained in 120 min demonstrating that the mineralization efficiency by the n pc1000 pms system is moderate in contrast p n pc and s n pc could achieve 58 4 and 30 7 of naproxen removal in 120 min respectively these observations suggest that dual doping on pcms might not be favorable for pms activation and naproxen degradation duan et al 2015 fig s7 and table s3 further displayed the rate constants k fitted by the first order kinetic model the k values for n pc900 n pc1000 p n pc and s n pc were estimated to be 0 037 0 175 0 017 and 0 009 min 1 respectively n pc1000 exhibited much higher reaction rate constant than other pcms suggesting that the highly porous structure and high surface area of n pc1000 are also beneficial for the catalytic reaction by exposing more active sites and transport channels wang et al 2019 fig 3c displays the effect of reaction temperature on naproxen degradation on n pc1000 not surprisingly an elevated reaction temperature resulted in an improved naproxen removal efficiency because higher temperature can simultaneously speed up the kinetics and pms activation an endothermic process based on the arrhenius equation the activation energy ea of n pc1000 for naproxen oxidation was calculated to be 19 0 kj mol which was lower than that of n doped graphene aerogel for ibuprofen degradation 87 5 kj mol n doped carbon nanotubes for phenol degradation 39 2 kj mol and co based porous carbon for p hba degradation 44 5 kj mol sun et al 2014 tian et al 2018 wang et al 2019 fig 3d displayed the recycling performance of n pc1000 complete naproxen degradations were achieved in 30 60 and 120 min for the 1st 2nd and 3rd runs respectively and 89 0 of naproxen could be removed in the 4th run the results indicated that the catalytic performance of n pc1000 was gradually deteriorated in successive catalytic reactions the deteriorated activity possibly stemmed from the altered surface chemistry in the oxidative environment as well as the coverage of active sites by the adsorbed naproxen and intermediates duan et al 2015 duan et al 2018b to probe the origins of the superior catalytic performances of pcms we made quantitative analysis between the naproxen degradation rate in a log scale log k and the structural parameters of pcms fig 4 as mentioned above a positive linear correlation r 2 0 91 has been established between the q max values and the ssa of pcms ideally the greater adsorption capacity could allow more target organics to participate in the catalytic reaction near the surface region of the carbocatalysts thereby enhancing the catalytic activity wang et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 however fig 4a indicates that the log k values were not positively correlated with the ssa of pcms s n pc possessed a higher ssa 834 m2 g and adsorption capacity than p n pc but s n pc manifested an inferior log k value in contrast n pc1000 exhibited a similar ssa to n pc900 but displayed a much higher log k value over n pc900 the results suggested that the catalytic activity of the carbocatalysts was not simply relying on the adsorption capacity but on the intrinsic configurations of carbons and heteroatom dopants as well as the optimized electronic structure of the catalytic sites for pms activation therefore the relationships between the structure and catalytic activity of pcms in pms adsorption and catalytic oxidation should be further investigated it was suggested that the ketonic c o groups on nanocarbons are rich in electrons which play an important role in pms activation for advanced oxidation duan et al 2016 shao et al 2018 herein we correlated the log k values to the ratios of a c o a c o in fig 4b the log k values increased with increasing ratios of a c o a c o while an obvious jump was observed for n pc1000 the ketonic groups can contribute to the performance of pcms in catalytic oxidation however this might not be the decisive factor additionally nitrogen doping has been illustrated to tailor the charge distribution of the sp2 hybridized carbons which can improve the catalytic activity in pms activation duan et al 2015 hu et al 2017 kang et al 2018 nevertheless fig 4c indicates that n pc1000 possessed the lowest n content and showed the highest log k value and that the contents of different n species in n pc1000 were the lowest in pcms fig 2c therefore the nitrogen dopants might not be the primary active sites on pcms in a recent study it was observed that a lower nitrogen content in carbon would lead to a higher activity in oxygen reduction reaction orr jia et al 2016 moreover by removing the n atoms under thermal pyrolysis the activities of the obtained defective carbons for orr oxygen evolution reaction oer and hydrogen evolution reaction her were much improved compared to the original n doped graphene jiang et al 2019 yan et al 2018 this was attributed to the fact that the thermal decomposition of the nitrogen atoms could result in the formation of defective sites vacancies and topological defects which were believed to exhibit higher catalytic activities the defect degree of pcms can be evaluated by the i d i g ratios from the raman spectra notably fig 4d displays a positive correlation between the log k values and the i d i g ratios of pcms r 2 0 99 indicating that the higher defective degree of pcms would give rise to the enhanced catalytic performance furthermore the hrtem images in fig s8 were used to visualize the fine structure of pcms for n pc900 and n pc1000 many non hexagonal carbon rings in pentagons and heptagons were identified in fig s8a and b suggesting the formation of defective domains throughout the carbon lattice in contrary clear crystal lattices were spotted in p n pc and s n pc with a d spacing of 0 21 nm whereas fewer vacant sites could be observed implying that heteroatoms co doping decreased the defect sites the hrtem observations were consistent with the raman spectra and the newly created structural defects might play a dominant role in catalytic pms activation and naproxen degradation 3 3 catalytic mechanisms pms can be activated by metal or metal free catalysts to produce highly reactive oxygen species ros for degradation of organic pollutants oh et al 2016 wang and wang 2018 to elucidate the catalytic mechanism in pcms pms system we conducted quenching tests using methanol meoh pms 500 as the radical scavenger because it could quickly scavenge both so4 kso4 3 2 106 m 1s 1 and oh k oh 9 7 108 m 1s 1 as shown in fig 5 a the impact of meoh on naproxen degradation by n pc900 n pc1000 p n pc and s n pc was insignificant taking n pc1000 as a representative further increasing meoh from 500 1 to 1000 1 or completely replacing the solvent from water to meoh posed a limited effect on the naproxen oxidation fig s9a suggesting that the naproxen oxidation might not rely on free radicals in the pcms pms system duan et al 2016 epr tests were employed to monitor the radical evolution during naproxen degradation using dmpo as the spin trapping agent as illustrated in fig s9b the specific signals of both so4 and oh were not detected which further confirmed that the free radicals did not account for the oxidation and other nonradical ros might be generated in the system previous studies revealed that singlet oxygen 1o2 could be generated from pms activation by ketonic groups and n doped carbon liang et al 2017 luo et al 2019 wang et al 2017 herein epr tests were carried out using 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp as the spin trapping agent to probe the existence of 1o2 fig 5b shows that characteristic triplet signals 1 1 1 were observed in the presence of pms and n pc1000 which were ascribed to the oxidized temp by 1o2 moreover the intensities of the signals increased rapidly in the first 20 min fig 5c and then declined gradually due to the substantial consumption of 1o2 by naproxen sodium azido nan3 as an effective scavenger of 1o2 k 1o2 1 0 109 m 1s 1 was also used in the quenching tests to further reveal the role of 1o2 as shown in fig 5d nan3 12 mm retarded the naproxen degradation from 98 8 to 57 4 in 30 min considering that the first order decay constant of 1o2 is 2 5 105 s 1 nan3 should decrease the degradation rate by 6 times the actual inhibition is not substantial thus 1o2 may play a significant role but it is certainly not the only reactive species involved in naproxen degradation in addition benzoic acid ba and furfuryl alcohol ffa were applied as the probe compounds for oh and 1o2 respectively shao et al 2018 as presented in fig s10a a complete oxidation of ffa was attained in the n pc1000 pms system while only 16 2 of ba was degraded the distinctive degradation performances for the different compounds further verified that 1o2 was present besides lower graphitic n content and a c o a c o ratio were obtained for the used n pc1000 as reflected by the xps spectra figs s11a c the results indicated that the ketonic groups and graphitic n atoms were consumed during the reaction which might be beneficial to the generation of 1o2 in pms system since pyrrole n and pyridinic n were the main species on pcms and the n species are mostly located at the edge n doping did not substantially contribute to the overall activity superoxide anion radical o2 might be generated to participate in the oxidation or 1o2 production via recombination with h2o cheng et al 2017 li et al 2015 p bq as an effective o2 scavenger was employed to determine the contribution of o2 to naproxen degradation the degradation efficiency was significantly inhibited by the addition of p bq 12 mm only 45 5 of naproxen was degraded over n pc1000 in 30 min fig 5d suggesting that o2 was generated in the n pc1000 pms system previous studies reported that the oxygen vacancies ovs on the surface of the metal oxides would induce abundant localized electrons which could facilitate the electron transfer to o2 to produce o2 qin et al 2018 likewise the electron rich ketonic groups on n pc1000 might also serve as basic lewis sites for o2 production cheng et al 2019 to verify the speculation we examined the effect of dissolved oxygen on the naproxen oxidation in the n pc1000 pms system fig s10b revealed that the naproxen degradation rate declined from 0 175 to 0 107 min 1 under continuous n2 purging suggesting that the dissolved oxygen participated in the generation of o2 1o2 for naproxen oxidation and that other reactive species different from ros should also be responsible for the reaction since o2 1o2 has a mild oxidation potential e0 o2 1o2 0 81 vnhe the reactions based on these reactive species might suffer from a low mineralization efficiency but benefit from their substrate specific reactivity and high selectivity in real water treatment lee et al 2020 furthermore dmso and ki were used to quench the surface bounded reactive species in the n pc1000 pms system the degradation efficiency of naproxen declined from 98 8 to 81 5 and 48 1 in 30 min in the presence of dmso 12 mm and ki 12 mm respectively since i can exert a shielding effect to prohibit the interactions between organic molecules and the carbon matrix zhu et al 2018 the moderate impeding effects of dmso and ki suggested that the surface activated ros should be partially responsible for the oxidation notably emerging nonradical oxidation was discovered in the n pc1000 pms system as none of the quenching agents could completely terminate the reaction moreover electrochemical techniques were employed to investigate the nonradical reaction as shown in fig 6 a the open circuit potential of glassy carbon electrode gce with n pc1000 coating n pc1000 gce rose immediately after pms addition while the potential decreased markedly upon the presence of naproxen it was speculated that the activation of pms to form a n pc1000 pms complex could elevate the potential of n pc1000 and that the decreased potential with the presence of naproxen further indicated the electron transfer process from naproxen as the electron donor ren et al 2019a b in contrast the potential of n pc1000 gce electrode without pms addition did not show any obvious variation fig 6b implying that the electron transfer process occurred on the n pc1000 pms system it was suggested that the defective sites on the carbon network were the active centers to mediate pms activation to form a highly reactive complex for nonradical oxidation duan et al 2016 in this work the hrtem witnessed many non hexagonal carbon rings on the n pc surface as the defective sites which was attributed to subtraction of nitrogen atoms under high temperature resulting in the formation of vacant sites jia et al 2016 the defective sites were able to confine the delocalized π system with a localized state showing completely different chemical and electronic properties and being highly active duan et al 2016 as discussed above it was confirmed that π π interaction played an important role in naproxen adsorption on the carbon surface the strong interaction between defective sites and pollutants enabled the pms molecules to oxidize contaminants directly via extracting electrons from adsorbed organics without generating free radicals duan et al 2016 moreover a higher defective degree of pcms gave rise to an improved organic removal efficiency while fig s11d also illustrates that the used n pc1000 had a smaller i d i g 0 98 value in comparison to the fresh sample which verified the consumption of the structural defects during the pms activation given that the structural defects graphitic n atoms and ketonic c o groups on n pc1000 were the active sites for direct electron transfer and generation of o2 1o2 there were three pathways for naproxen degradation by the n pc1000 pms system i pollutants were oxidized by adsorption on the carbon lattice and donating electrons to the vacant sites that activate pms to form highly reactive complexes ii partial pms molecules were oxidized around graphitic n atoms and ketonic c o groups to produce 1o2 for pollutant degradation iii the electron rich c o groups transferred electrons to o2 to produce o2 either participating in the oxidation or producing 1o2 via combination with water by comparison with other conventional catalysts such as n doped reduced graphene oxide n rgo multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnt co3o4 and α mno2 in fig s12a n pc1000 well outperformed the other catalysts in naproxen oxidation pre experiments and parallel tests indicated that the il derived carbons could be manufactured in a large scale with well defined structures the cost of hvim no3 is about 80 kg while the presumed cost of il derived carbon is 2 g which is comparatively lower than that of carbon nanotubes 5 200 g and graphene 10 500 g for naproxen at 20 mg l 1 g n pc1000 could purify more than 80 l of polluted water and even a larger volume with low concentration contaminants based on the adsorption isotherm and degradation curves it was speculated that naproxen at a trace level in real water matrix 1 mg l could be efficiently enriched on the carbon surface and rapidly decomposed by the oxidative system fig s12b revealed that n pc1000 pms system was also effective in degradation of other organic pollutants the removal efficiencies for bpa phenol and ibuprofen were 81 5 89 4 and 95 5 respectively in 120 min in addition naproxen degradation by n pc1000 pms system was further evaluated using natural water and tap water samples as water matrices fig s13 though abundant natural organic matters noms or chloride ions occur in the water samples 99 5 and 81 1 naproxen removals were attained in 45 min in the natural water and tap water samples respectively demonstrating that the n pc1000 pms system benefits from minimal interference of background noms ions and high selectivity toward oxidation of naproxen as shown in fig s14 hplc spectra monitored the generation and evolution of the intermediates during naproxen oxidation meanwhile gc ms with electron ionization ei and lc ms with electron spray ionization esi were applied to detect the by products and to reveal the degradation pathways of naproxen two main compounds were detected by hplc which were identified as 1 acetyl 6 methoxynaphthalene and 6 methoxy 2 vinylnaphthalene by gc ms with the mass of 200 23 and 184 23 respectively lc ms spectra shown in fig s16 further detected seven intermediates with m z of 134 184 200 218 235 261 and 339 the identification of the intermediates revealed that naproxen oxidation was initiated by the hydroxylation of the methyl position of naproxen followed by subsequent hydroxylation and demethylation chi et al 2019 coria et al 2016 even though oh was barely detected in the n pc1000 pms system hydroxylation can also take place via direct electron transfer and then react with water additionally naproxen could be oxidized by direct addition of hydroxyl groups on the naphthalene ring hou et al 2020 which could be further oxidized to the ring opening products as well as co2 and h2o the degradation pathways of naproxen by the n pc1000 pms system were proposed in fig 7 4 conclusions in summary porous carbon materials were prepared via one pot thermal pyrolysis using ils as carbon and dopant precursors it was found that n doping or dual doping on pcms might not be favorable for pms activation and naproxen degradation as they occupy the defects and edges instead a higher defective degree of pcms gave rise to an improved organic removal efficiency the derived n pc1000 manifested the highest catalytic performance in pms activation for naproxen oxidation the 3d porous structure with abundant defective sites ketonic c o groups and graphitic n doped atoms on n pc1000 synergistically facilitated the redox reactions during pms activation it was revealed that the defective domains were the active centers for pms activation to induce activated pms carbon complexes for nonradical oxidation while ketonic c o groups and n doped atoms contributed better to the generation of 1o2 o2 in pms system this study offers a novel protocol for fabricating an efficient carbocatalyst for water purification and contributes to a better understanding of the heterogeneous pms activation by defect based nonradical carbocatalysis

17601,unexplainable concrete softening below the water line has been observed by sydney water in their gravity sewer network some of which is subjected to corrosion control methods using chemical ferrous chloride fecl2 dosing of the wastewater we applied a combination of physical and chemical tools to determine the properties of the top 20 mm of concrete cores recovered from sewer pipes these techniques consist of neutron tomographic imaging scanning electron microscopy hardness mapping and ph profiling concrete cores were collected from roof crown tidal wall and below flow regions of gravity sewer pipes of sydney water s wastewater system from locations that received no treatment as well as locations dosed with fecl2 all samples showed a degree of softening of the surface exposed to the sewerage with an associated depletion in calcium concentration and reduced ph in the same regions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewer pipes concrete corrosion ferrous chloride neutron tomography microindentation hardness ph profiling 1 introduction corrosion of concrete sewer pipes is a principle factor affecting sewer pipe longevity and reliability with mitigation and rehabilitation costing hundreds of millions of dollars per annum in australia alone biogenically generated sulfuric acid attack has been identified as the leading cause of concrete degradation in gravity sewer systems islander et al 1991 joseph et al 2012 this attack can happen above the water line as well as in the tidal zone there are many factors that affect the corrosion rate including availability of oxygen temperature humidity h2s level the degree of concrete pore saturation concrete composition permeability effluent ph and concrete ph apgar et al 2008 brown et al 2000 grengg et al 2018 islander et al 1991 joseph et al 2012 revertegat et al 1992 wells et al 2009 of these ph of concrete is perhaps the most significant factor with large increases in corrosion rates below ph 7 neutral grengg et al 2018 islander et al 1991 joseph et al 2012 taheri 2019 and rapid concrete breakdown at ph lower than 3 regardless of the cement paste composition cao et al 1997 revertegat et al 1992 corrosion erosion of concrete below the water line is likely due to excessive velocities presence of abrasive materials or acids and other chemicals in the waste stream bell et al 2000 however it is less well understood and measured water utilities treat wastewater with the addition of chemical salts to reduce the amount of hydrogen sulfide gas h2s available for microbiological oxidation into sulfuric acid on the walls of the sewer ganigue et al 2011 jefferson et al 2002 kiliswa 2016 zhang et al 2008 sydney water in particular have been dosing wastewater with ferrous chloride fecl2 for a number a decade fecl2 treatment is a well documented less hazardous and relatively inexpensive practice to remove dissolved sulfide from the sewage ferrous iron fe2 reacts stoichiometrically with the dissolved sulfide s2 and the ferrous sulfide fes precipitates out of the wastewater the fes is a highly insoluble metal sulfide thus the possibility of a reversed reaction and the release of sulfate back to the solution is very low jameel 1989 kiilerich et al 2017 moreover this method has very little effect on the ph of the wastewater as only one mole of hydrogen ion is generated per mole of sulfide removed the addition of fecl2 to rising main sewer has been found to lead to a 75 95 reduction in dissolved sulfide in the wastewater and a 50 60 reduction in the concentrations of h2s in the headspaces of the gravity sewers carrying the waste apté 2015 ganigue et al 2011 despite the widespread use of such mitigation programs there is little quantitative data to assess their impact on concrete characteristics jiang et al 2014 taheri et al 2018 sewer traverse inspections made by experienced sydney water operators suggest that ferrous chloride dosing may soften the concrete below the flow line numerous studies have addressed the effectiveness of ferrous chloride dosing in reducing the transfer of hydrogen sulfide to the sewer air however there is no information in the literature on the effect of ferrous chloride on concrete in sewers in this paper we aim to quantify the sub aqua field observations of concrete softening for the first time to determine if there is a physical impact of fecl2 dosing on concrete below the wastewater flow our approach used a suite of assessment techniques to characterize and correlate the physical properties of concrete corrosion with associated chemical changes measurement techniques including 3 dimensional 3d neutron tomographic nt imaging 2 dimensional 2d scanning electron microscopy sem apparent hardness mapping and ph profiling were employed to identify corrosion characteristics and relate them to chemical and morphological measurements 2 experimental 2 1 concrete sampling preparation and visual examination a set of concrete cores were recovered from a range of sewer environments managed by sydney water using a diamond tipped core drill 25 mm diameter and 40 70 mm lengths cores were collected from i sydney water sites where the wastewater had not been dosed with chemicals and ii sydney water sites where the wastewater had been dosed with fecl2 samples were collected from below flow bf roof crown rf and tidal td sections of the sewer pipe wall at each site as shown in fig 1 cores were labeled as set a which received no treatment and set b which transports wastewater dosed with fecl2 twenty cores were chosen for this study set a 4 bf 3 td and 3 rf and set b 4 bf 3 td and 3 rf visual inspection of the cores was performed as a simple and fast quality control measurement technique to examine the following features general composition of the concrete and its color apparent coarse aggregate to mortar proportions depth of corrosion and carbonation nominal maximum size of fine and coarse aggregates and distribution in concrete crack depth and width and finally presence of pores or entrained air taheri et al 2018 2 2 three dimensional 3d visualization using neutron tomographic nt imaging neutron tomography data was collected at the australian nuclear science and technology organization ansto using the dingo thermal neutron radiography tomography imaging station located on the hb 2 beam tangentially facing the 20 mw open pool australian lightwater opal reactor garbe et al 2011 18 cores were first test imaged using nt out of which one core from each rf bf and td area from set a and set b were then studied comprehensively the core samples were scanned with a low intensity low divergent neutron beam with a collimation ratio of l d 1000 where l is the collimator length and d is the neutron aperture diameter to ensure highest available spatial resolution astm e803 17 2017 neutrons were converted to photons using a 100 100 0 05 mm zns ag 6lif scintillator screen and the resultant photons were detected by an andor ikon l ccd camera liquid cooled 16 bit 2048 2048 pixels coupled with a fully extended makro planar 100 mm carl zeiss lens to achieve a pixel size of 26 8 26 8 μm the core samples were vertically stacked and a total of 751 equally spaced neutron shadow radiographs with an exposure length of 85 s were obtained every 0 24 as the samples were rotated over 180 about their vertical axis both dark closed shutter and beam profile open shutter images were obtained for calibration before initiating shadow radiograph acquisition a cosmic ray filter was applied to all images to reduce data noise associated with non neutron background radiation detection events images were processed using fiji imagej national institutes of health schindelin et al 2012 software followed by use of the octopus reconstruction v 8 9 1 inside matters nv for tomographic three dimensional 3d reconstruction yielding a voxel size of 26 8 26 8 26 8 μm and virtual slices perpendicular to the rotation axis the reconstructed volume data were rendered and further processed using vgstudio max 3 0 volume graphics gmbh 2 3 scanning electron microscopy sem and elemental analysis ea after completion of the tomographic imaging cores were sectioned in half with one half set in epofix epoxy resin struers australia in 2 5 2 5 4 5 cm3 cube molds using a resin to hardener ratio of 25 3 these were then polished and visually inspected before being coated with a thin conductive layer of carbon 10 s at the pressure of 5 5 10 5 mbar using a boc edwards auto 306 vacuum coater prior to imaging and elemental mapping in a scanning electron microscope sem the sectioned cores were imaged using a zeiss evo ma15 sem with a tungsten w filament elemental analysis was carried out using an energy dispersive x ray microanalysis system which utilized an oxford instruments 20 mm2 x max sdd the qualitative and quantitative analysis were carried out at an accelerating voltage of 15 kev which was found to be an optimal setting for these samples data analysis was performed using the aztec acquisition software the other half of the cores were used to observe crystal formation and topographic features therefore they were not fixed in epoxy resin or coated with a conductive layer uncoated sample observation was performed using a hitachi tabletop microscope tm3030 equipped with a sdd silicon drift detector 2 4 hardness testing using microindentation the hardness of polished cores was measured using the vickers hv 0 1 method and a durascan struers a s micro macro hardness tester to check the vickers hardness of cores samples were sectioned with a diamond saw metallographically mounted and polished to make the surface smooth and reflective enough to clearly resolve the microscopic hardness impression with the measuring microscope igarashi et al 1996 2 5 ph profiling the ph depth profile of concrete cores was measured using a universal indicator solution ph 3 11 from chemsupply the use of indicators to determine the altered zones of cementitious materials has been discussed in the literature before manso et al 2017 yu et al 2010 yet there is no standard test procedure for concrete ph measurement since we were interested in areas effected by acid corrosion instead of using the phenolphthalein method yu et al 2010 which is limited to a certain ph range indicator turns colorless below ph 8 2 we employed a universal ph indicator this indicator revealed acidic neutral and alkaline ph areas with different color codes the sample was cut in half the surface smoothed and then rinsed with deionized d i water prior to the test to remove any carbonation effects a few drops of ph indicator fluid were spread on each sample surface and left to dry at room temperature the stained surfaces were imaged using a leica automated microscope and the data processed using the leica application suite las ver4 4 3 results 3 1 3d visualization of cores neutron tomography is analogous to the x ray computed tomography technique practiced in hospitals for detecting broken bones in which a series of shadow radiographs are taken and a full 3d image of the object is reconstructed using a computer neutrons mainly interact with matter through absorption and scattering with atomic nuclei the neutron beam attenuation is strongly affected by the concentration of light atoms such as hydrogen the higher penetration of neutrons relative to x rays through materials such as concrete and steel permits non destructive imaging of cracks or internal structures in thicker samples than is achievable using x rays neutron tomography is therefore a valuable tool to see inside concrete cores nondestructively najjar et al 1986 de beer et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 schwarz et al 2005 dauti et al 2018 fig 2 contains images obtained from vertical slices of the 3d tomographic reconstructions of representative below flow cores obtained from each region using the neutron tomographic imaging technique dark areas represent aggregates and lighter gray areas are cement paste cp the intensity in gray color correlates with differences in attenuation of the neutron beam through each component phase in the aggregate the variations in the intensity of the lighter gray area are due to chemical and or physical density changes in the cp du plessis et al 2019 as evident by the layered appearance of the grayish cp area in fig 2a b in the untreated below flow bf core fig 2a the depth of chemical or physical density changes was more than 10 mm while in the treated bf core set b fig 2b it was found to be less than 5 mm fig 3 is a 3d reconstruction of a 2d dataset of the control core set a bf the depth of corrosion penetration of chemicals and precipitation of some elements in the crack lines of imaged cores can be visualized variation in color within each phase corresponds approximately with varying concentration of light elements such as hydrogen within that phase a classic application of this technique can be quality control of the concrete s physical condition prior to in depth imaging using techniques such as sem the colored areas in fig 3 visualize the result of the porosity analysis with volume graphics vgstudio max with the color coding assigned to the size of the voids color coding of pore volumes shows the largest pores in pink red 8 500 m3 labeled as defect and the smallest pore in blue 2 000 m3 see color legend in fig 3 both set a and set b samples have connected pores at the surface area first 5 mm and have disconnected pore structures from the depth above 10 mm the surface porosity first 5 mm is higher in set a and the medium size pores are mainly in the first 5 mm from the surface set b data not shown has a more uniform distribution of medium green color and large size pores across the sample the 3d reconstruction of a set a and set b below flow sample from 2d neutron transmission images using neutron tomography are accessible through a separate video file as supplementary material 3 2 visual examination a close look at the sectioned and polished cores obtained from the sewer pipes revealed significant differences in the formulation of the concrete used at different sites and the depth of corrosion all cores show a highly cracked area in the first 3 mm from the surface untreated set a samples appear to have the most cracks and voids examples of cores from below flows of set a and set b are shown in fig 4 the depth and pattern of corrosion the visual color change and observed layered structure is different in samples obtained from the various locations and ranges from 0 44 mm up to 7 mm below flow bf samples in general show deeper chemical penetration thicker corroded layer while roof rf corroded layers showing color dissimilarity are often very thin this may be due to the corroded layers falling off over time the set a bf specimen fig 4a also shows a number of layers of dissimilar color formed on top of the sample and that the depth of chemical penetration can be up to 7 mm the depth of corrosion in the set b bf samples fig 4b was found to be less than 3 mm and in general samples taken from this area were found to have visibly thinner corroded layers since there is no record of the level of corrosion erosion in this section prior to fecl2 dosing it is not clear if the ferrous chloride has caused there to be a thinner corroded layer or not the exposed aggregate finish seen in fig 4b suggests that the corroded layer has already been washed out with the sewage stream as an exposed aggregate surface is not a standard surface finish for a concrete pipe based on the color differences observed from the surface to the bulk of the cores samples were visually sectioned into three zones as shown in a sample core illustrated in fig 5 the breakdowns are as follow a corroded layer surface zone sz located at the darkest region on the top excluding thin biofilm layer and assumed to be the most corroded part of the sample b below corroded layer intermediate zone itz located below the visible dark region and c concrete bulk intact zone iz the visual appearance suggests that it is not affected by corrosion 3 3 cross sectional morphology and elemental distribution morphological observations were made on polished epoxy impregnated surfaces of sliced cores using a full sized sem fig 6 a and microstructural studies were made on simply sawn unpolished surfaces to preserve crack patterns and crystal structures using a tabletop sem fig 6b and c this matched the existence of three zones fig 5 within the cores consisting of a cracked and highly deteriorated surface zone with loosely bounded aggregate sz a zone of deposited corrosion products itz which in general is a layer with a distinct color adjacent to the crack lines and primarily is made up of gypsum around aggregates and penetrated ions in pores followed by a chemically unchanged zone iz which can contain some cracks at the sz of set a samples fig 6b and c the dissolution of ca2 and other hydration products from the cement paste and the ingress of s from the acid bath resulted in the formation of rectangular gypsum caso4 2h2o the secondary ettringite 3cao al2o3 3caso4 32h2o and the calcite caco3 crystals mori et al 1992 santhanam et al 2003a santhanam et al 2003b wang et al 2019 the intact zone iz of set a consists of the primary ettringite portlandite ca oh 2 and amorphous calcium silicate hydrate c s h phases höhlig et al 2017 mori et al 1992 the secondary ettringite crystals were not detected at sz of set b fig 6 but the gypsum and the calcite crystals were mainly at the sz and the calcium hydroxide c h the c s h was mainly at the iz external ions from wastewater can migrate into concrete constructions through the free passage provided by gypsum pores and cracks the penetration depth is proportional to immersion time and an increase in the number of voids and cracks ming et al 2016 bishnoi 2007 nilsen et al 1993 the elemental analysis eds of the polished epoxy impregnated cores showed major peaks arising from the o c mg al si ca zn and fe color coded maps of selected elements ca s and fe showing the distribution of elements across the polished bf sample faces are shown in fig 7 the color intensity map at different depths can be easily correlated to the type of treatment and depth of deterioration calcium concentration from the exposed surface to about 250 µm into each of the cores was found to be relatively low then increasing with depth the concentration of sulfur and iron decreases with depth elemental percentages by weight from concrete core analysis as a function of depth mm are shown in fig 8 where averaged elemental distributions for calcium sulfur and iron are plotted of the two sets of cores set a and set b the plots were also separated into below flow tidal and roof sections the elemental analysis of the concrete bulk iz versus surface concrete sz itz shows a fourfold depletion of calcium of the surface concrete compared to intact concrete bulk up to a depth of 10 mm fig 8a although not all elemental data are shown in this paper the ca2 of the surface has been replaced by other elements like s and fe fig 7 as well as mg al and zn sulfur penetration through pores and cracks can be detected in all cores fig 8b sulfur has moved deeper than 10 mm in the bf and td samples which received no treatment set a while in other samples it cannot be detected from depth of 3 4 mm onward sulfur presence is more intense around major crack lines at the surface 10 to 14 42 wt while it decreases to less than 0 52 wt in intact cement paste areas gypsum crystals plates observed in fig 6b forms during sulfate attack following the reaction between calcium hydroxide c h and sulfate ions transported to the concrete by wastewater contaminates such as na2so4 mgso4 feso4 and caso4 this could be another reason for the softer surface and deterioration pattern which will be discussed later santhanam et al 2003a monteny et al 2000 set b cores from sewer pipes carrying sewage treated with fecl2 show enhanced concentrations of iron in the first 500 µm from the surface fig 7 the fe ion penetration depth in dosed below flow samples was observed to be much deeper and can reach depths of up to 15 mm an alteration of concrete composition and formation and deposition of a fe rich layer across the first crack line is evident by sem fig 7 it is assumed that the newly formed phase is chemically more stable and therefore hinders further and more pronounced diffusion of fe into the pores the iron fe2 concentration in the composition of portland cement is around 4 weight percent wt the average concentration of fe wt detected across the first 3 mm of all samples is however higher than this average chlorine cl cannot be detected in concrete cores as the encasing resin used to prepare samples for testing also contains cl analysis of the concrete cores also revealed the presence of other elements determined by eds analysis and phase identification using aztec software data not shown magnesium has a distinct presence at the surface of all samples below the corroded layer the penetration of mg2 and the phase change of c s h calcium silicate hydrate to m s h magnesium silicate hydrate may contribute to deterioration since m s h has lower strength than c s h santhanam et al 2003b the presence of zinc in untreated set a cores on the first 800 µm2 of the surface might be part of pollutants absorbed through the pores and cracks from the sewage since zinc is not a common element in a concrete formulation nor was it observed in other samples or deeper zones of same samples the presence of a high concentration of phosphorous p at first 500 µm2 of some samples can be due to different concrete formulations the use of a different portland cement admixture or the deposition of iron phosphate 3 4 hardness measurements the cross sections of concrete cores were further assessed with a vickers hardness test to check whether changes in cement paste color observed with concrete depth could be correlated with a change in hardness the vickers hardness values obtained from corrosion impacted areas and comparing them with hardness values of intact concrete bulk are useful indicators of concrete properties and expected service behavior a decrease in hardness can be interpreted as an indication of deterioration hardness testing is a much simpler test to perform than a direct compressive or tensile strength test based on the visual sectioning of cores shown in fig 5 eight points on each core were tested points 1 to 3 which correlate to a depth of 1 2 and 3 mm from the surface of a specimen and corroded layer points 4 to 6 which correlate to a depth of 6 8 and 10 mm from the surface of a specimen and below corroded layer itz points 7 and 8 which correlate to a depth of 15 and 20 mm from the surface of a specimen and from concrete bulk iz softening of the hydrated cement matrix was observed within the first few hundred micrometers of all cores with below flow bf cores exhibiting a softer surface than tidal td and roof rf regions the difference in hardness between dosed or undosed rf regions is within the measurement error therefore we only concentrate on bf and td cores for the remainder of this section the normalized hardness results of bf and td cores is plotted in fig 9 interestingly the visual sectioning of cores corresponds with the difference in hardness values obtained from vickers method a range of 20 50 averaged data points were used for every data point shown in the hardness trend plots since concrete formulations are unknown and dissimilar data of each region were normalized against each other by assuming the hardness of the intact zone should be constant in other words all unmodified regions sit around 100 meaning the concrete matrix in this area has not been affected by corrosion the hardness at the surface zone can be seen to vary by 25 a value which depends on the core region td or bf the concrete mix age or a range of other wastewater characteristics that we haven t measured the observed hardness of the corroded layers confirms that the concrete surface has become soft and spongy and the exposed aggregate of the cores fig 4 support our theory that part of the corroded layer has already fallen off unfortunately the amount of lost matter for each core is unknown therefore it is very difficult to draw conclusions regarding the effect of chemical dosing on hardness values on average it can be seen that there is a significant change in hardness as a function of depth by more than 40 within the transition region of all cores tested for untreated sites this change occurs over a depth of 8 mm whilst at dosed sites the hardness changes over a larger depth of 12 mm the larger transition region seen for dosed cores could either be due to less corroded matter falling off these cores or that the increased uptake of fe at dosed sites fig 8 contributes to an observed thicker amount of softer material in any case this softening to concrete conduits around and below the water line correlates with field observations conducted by sydney water as mentioned above all cores show softening of the surface this softening can be correlated to calcium depletion this linear correlation is plotted in fig 10 and as can be seen the softer the area the lower the calcium presence in that area in fig 10 the calcium concentration and the hardness data acquired from dosed sites were combined with the undosed site based on the zonal map presented in fig 5 and the average value of each data point was plotted with 5 x and y error bars intact concrete zones usually have a hardness value around 60 80 with calcium content near 27 33 wt whereas surface zones have hardness values between 25 and 40 with a calcium content of 10 wt during sulfate corrosion the penetration of aggressive media leads to an increase of the porosity of the material and the damage degree the penetration depth of mg s and fe fig 7 can be also correlated to the hardness profile and considered as an indicator of concrete deterioration in sewer pipes 3 5 ph profiling as shown in fig 11 a we successfully managed to visualize areas with different ph profiles using the method described in section 2 5 fast carbonation of the exposed sample surface however is a big problem and can interfere with accurate imaging of the ph at different depths to eliminate this surface smoothening and sanding just prior to ph measurement is highly recommended all samples show a ph value less than 5 in the surface zone whilst the ph increases above 6 when moving to the intact zone set b roof samples have a corroded region ph 5 less than 3 mm with the remaining intact zone visualized by a purple color representing a ph value above 9 below flow samples show an acidic region up to a depth of 10 mm with the ph of the concrete bulk at depth above 10 mm being neutral tidal samples indicate an acidic region up to 6 mm deep and an intact zone with a ph value between 6 and 9 these results all correlate with the hardness and ca depletion results outlined earlier the ph depth profiles plotted in fig 11b d show that the first 10 mm of all cores except for dosed rf samples have a ph below neutral fig 12 plots the calcium depletion versus ph at different depths the calcium concentration data set and the ph data set acquired from the dosed sites were combined with the undosed sites based on the zonal map presented in fig 5 and the mean of each data point was plotted with 5 x and y error bars here again we see the same trend between calcium concentration and the ph the more acidic the area the lower will be the calcium presence in that area our results thus show that a low ph value can be associated with the known fact of the onset of concrete corrosion 4 discussion after analyzing the sewer pipe cores recovered from sydney s wastewater network we found that the concrete formulation greatly influenced a core s corrodibility depth and rate of corrosion and chemical penetration the corrosion front identified via ph profiling sem and tomographic imaging was found to be deeper than the visual color dissimilarity in the first few millimeters of sliced cores the major difference between the depth of corrosion in roof tidal and below flow samples suggests that different mechanisms and the rate of deterioration is based on the location of the concrete below flow concrete samples corroded the most up to 10 mm in depth whilst corrosion in roof samples was confined to a maximum depth of 6 mm these results indicate that flow and liquid penetration may play a role in the rate of corrosion and depth of chemical penetration all collected concrete cores showed a gradient feature of properties moving away from the surface and toward the intact concrete bulk parameters such as ph hardness and calcium concentration increase in a gradient fashion the depth associated with the lowest hardness coincided with the location of a calcium depleted area in the matrix as well as an area with a lower ph value hence calcium depletion and associated ph levels contribute to a decline in performance and long term durability of a concrete structure the softening in the near surface paste can also be linked to sulfate attack as well as carbonation leaching depletion or both wastewater flow and liquid penetration are also important factors when investigating species migration and corrosion rates below the water line the corrosion above the water line also follows a different mechanism therefore there is a need to consider the presence of multiple modes of deterioration in concrete structures and their potential synergistic interaction the presence of unexpected elements in elemental analysis could be a result of dissolution and precipitation of elements from the wastewater itself or due to the different concrete formulations used at different sydney water sites it must be borne in mind that the concrete cores collected were from sewers with different age and location therefore have different formulations furthermore there is an unknown amount of matter that has been lost and fallen off the surface of the retrieved cores due to either corrosion erosion whilst in situ and or from the high pressure clean that was undertaken prior to characterization once retrieved from site whilst this has made the influence of chemical dosing hard to interpret and the comparison between the cores very difficult due to a difference in the rate and mechanism of concrete corrosion our results showed that our methodologies can be used to characterize and better understand the mechanisms of sewer concrete corrosion all samples evaluated had cracks and a grayish white discolored surface as the most obvious signs of corrosion in concrete when the signs of damage become visible the extent of corrosion on the cement paste has already reached an advanced stage thus it is important to identify different stages of corrosion at different depths within a concrete sample neutron tomography serves this purpose and can be used to screen the depth and extent of corrosion non destructively the evaluation of the differences in the textures and the intensity of the gray area revealed the extent of the chemical and or physical density changes in the cement paste an in depth characterization of the concrete samples was then performed using a sem eds technique which confirmed the differences in the crystalline structures and showed the elemental composition changes in all three zones surface intermediate and intact zones due to corrosion the apparent hardness measurement helped to quantify the degree and the depth of softening in the concrete it was the ph profiling method that shed light on the early stages of corrosion in the intact zone of set a below flow ph 6 while the study of hardness and the elemental changes did not show any signs of corrosions in the intact zone of set a below flow therefore the combination of the various techniques used in this work gave a deeper understanding of the corrosion the stage of corrosion and the effect of wastewater treatment on concrete in the sewer 5 conclusion the combination of neutron tomography scanning electron microscopy with and without elementary analysis ph profiling and vickers hardness microindentation was converted into a methodology to assess concrete deterioration this approach provided a detailed understanding of the correlation between the physical and chemical mechanisms that lead to softening of the near surface paste we observed softening in the near surface zone of all 20 recovered concrete cores concrete softening was observed over a larger depth in below flow and tidal cores recovered from sites where the wastewater had been dosed with fecl2 there was also a noticeable iron uptake in cores from fecl2 dosed areas below the water line and in tidal areas which reached depths of up to 15 mm on average we detected a significant change in hardness as a function of depth in below flow and tidal areas reducing by more than 40 in the transition region this correlates with field data collected by sydney water roof samples had a smaller corroded area compared to below the water line samples and that hardness did not really change with depth nevertheless the corrosion above the water line follows a different mechanism than the below water line from the limited number of samples assessed in this project we conclude that concrete core softening correlates to a depletion in calcium and a reduction in ph the influence of fecl2 chemical dosing on concrete sewer pipes however requires further investigation declaration of competing interest the

17601,unexplainable concrete softening below the water line has been observed by sydney water in their gravity sewer network some of which is subjected to corrosion control methods using chemical ferrous chloride fecl2 dosing of the wastewater we applied a combination of physical and chemical tools to determine the properties of the top 20 mm of concrete cores recovered from sewer pipes these techniques consist of neutron tomographic imaging scanning electron microscopy hardness mapping and ph profiling concrete cores were collected from roof crown tidal wall and below flow regions of gravity sewer pipes of sydney water s wastewater system from locations that received no treatment as well as locations dosed with fecl2 all samples showed a degree of softening of the surface exposed to the sewerage with an associated depletion in calcium concentration and reduced ph in the same regions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewer pipes concrete corrosion ferrous chloride neutron tomography microindentation hardness ph profiling 1 introduction corrosion of concrete sewer pipes is a principle factor affecting sewer pipe longevity and reliability with mitigation and rehabilitation costing hundreds of millions of dollars per annum in australia alone biogenically generated sulfuric acid attack has been identified as the leading cause of concrete degradation in gravity sewer systems islander et al 1991 joseph et al 2012 this attack can happen above the water line as well as in the tidal zone there are many factors that affect the corrosion rate including availability of oxygen temperature humidity h2s level the degree of concrete pore saturation concrete composition permeability effluent ph and concrete ph apgar et al 2008 brown et al 2000 grengg et al 2018 islander et al 1991 joseph et al 2012 revertegat et al 1992 wells et al 2009 of these ph of concrete is perhaps the most significant factor with large increases in corrosion rates below ph 7 neutral grengg et al 2018 islander et al 1991 joseph et al 2012 taheri 2019 and rapid concrete breakdown at ph lower than 3 regardless of the cement paste composition cao et al 1997 revertegat et al 1992 corrosion erosion of concrete below the water line is likely due to excessive velocities presence of abrasive materials or acids and other chemicals in the waste stream bell et al 2000 however it is less well understood and measured water utilities treat wastewater with the addition of chemical salts to reduce the amount of hydrogen sulfide gas h2s available for microbiological oxidation into sulfuric acid on the walls of the sewer ganigue et al 2011 jefferson et al 2002 kiliswa 2016 zhang et al 2008 sydney water in particular have been dosing wastewater with ferrous chloride fecl2 for a number a decade fecl2 treatment is a well documented less hazardous and relatively inexpensive practice to remove dissolved sulfide from the sewage ferrous iron fe2 reacts stoichiometrically with the dissolved sulfide s2 and the ferrous sulfide fes precipitates out of the wastewater the fes is a highly insoluble metal sulfide thus the possibility of a reversed reaction and the release of sulfate back to the solution is very low jameel 1989 kiilerich et al 2017 moreover this method has very little effect on the ph of the wastewater as only one mole of hydrogen ion is generated per mole of sulfide removed the addition of fecl2 to rising main sewer has been found to lead to a 75 95 reduction in dissolved sulfide in the wastewater and a 50 60 reduction in the concentrations of h2s in the headspaces of the gravity sewers carrying the waste apté 2015 ganigue et al 2011 despite the widespread use of such mitigation programs there is little quantitative data to assess their impact on concrete characteristics jiang et al 2014 taheri et al 2018 sewer traverse inspections made by experienced sydney water operators suggest that ferrous chloride dosing may soften the concrete below the flow line numerous studies have addressed the effectiveness of ferrous chloride dosing in reducing the transfer of hydrogen sulfide to the sewer air however there is no information in the literature on the effect of ferrous chloride on concrete in sewers in this paper we aim to quantify the sub aqua field observations of concrete softening for the first time to determine if there is a physical impact of fecl2 dosing on concrete below the wastewater flow our approach used a suite of assessment techniques to characterize and correlate the physical properties of concrete corrosion with associated chemical changes measurement techniques including 3 dimensional 3d neutron tomographic nt imaging 2 dimensional 2d scanning electron microscopy sem apparent hardness mapping and ph profiling were employed to identify corrosion characteristics and relate them to chemical and morphological measurements 2 experimental 2 1 concrete sampling preparation and visual examination a set of concrete cores were recovered from a range of sewer environments managed by sydney water using a diamond tipped core drill 25 mm diameter and 40 70 mm lengths cores were collected from i sydney water sites where the wastewater had not been dosed with chemicals and ii sydney water sites where the wastewater had been dosed with fecl2 samples were collected from below flow bf roof crown rf and tidal td sections of the sewer pipe wall at each site as shown in fig 1 cores were labeled as set a which received no treatment and set b which transports wastewater dosed with fecl2 twenty cores were chosen for this study set a 4 bf 3 td and 3 rf and set b 4 bf 3 td and 3 rf visual inspection of the cores was performed as a simple and fast quality control measurement technique to examine the following features general composition of the concrete and its color apparent coarse aggregate to mortar proportions depth of corrosion and carbonation nominal maximum size of fine and coarse aggregates and distribution in concrete crack depth and width and finally presence of pores or entrained air taheri et al 2018 2 2 three dimensional 3d visualization using neutron tomographic nt imaging neutron tomography data was collected at the australian nuclear science and technology organization ansto using the dingo thermal neutron radiography tomography imaging station located on the hb 2 beam tangentially facing the 20 mw open pool australian lightwater opal reactor garbe et al 2011 18 cores were first test imaged using nt out of which one core from each rf bf and td area from set a and set b were then studied comprehensively the core samples were scanned with a low intensity low divergent neutron beam with a collimation ratio of l d 1000 where l is the collimator length and d is the neutron aperture diameter to ensure highest available spatial resolution astm e803 17 2017 neutrons were converted to photons using a 100 100 0 05 mm zns ag 6lif scintillator screen and the resultant photons were detected by an andor ikon l ccd camera liquid cooled 16 bit 2048 2048 pixels coupled with a fully extended makro planar 100 mm carl zeiss lens to achieve a pixel size of 26 8 26 8 μm the core samples were vertically stacked and a total of 751 equally spaced neutron shadow radiographs with an exposure length of 85 s were obtained every 0 24 as the samples were rotated over 180 about their vertical axis both dark closed shutter and beam profile open shutter images were obtained for calibration before initiating shadow radiograph acquisition a cosmic ray filter was applied to all images to reduce data noise associated with non neutron background radiation detection events images were processed using fiji imagej national institutes of health schindelin et al 2012 software followed by use of the octopus reconstruction v 8 9 1 inside matters nv for tomographic three dimensional 3d reconstruction yielding a voxel size of 26 8 26 8 26 8 μm and virtual slices perpendicular to the rotation axis the reconstructed volume data were rendered and further processed using vgstudio max 3 0 volume graphics gmbh 2 3 scanning electron microscopy sem and elemental analysis ea after completion of the tomographic imaging cores were sectioned in half with one half set in epofix epoxy resin struers australia in 2 5 2 5 4 5 cm3 cube molds using a resin to hardener ratio of 25 3 these were then polished and visually inspected before being coated with a thin conductive layer of carbon 10 s at the pressure of 5 5 10 5 mbar using a boc edwards auto 306 vacuum coater prior to imaging and elemental mapping in a scanning electron microscope sem the sectioned cores were imaged using a zeiss evo ma15 sem with a tungsten w filament elemental analysis was carried out using an energy dispersive x ray microanalysis system which utilized an oxford instruments 20 mm2 x max sdd the qualitative and quantitative analysis were carried out at an accelerating voltage of 15 kev which was found to be an optimal setting for these samples data analysis was performed using the aztec acquisition software the other half of the cores were used to observe crystal formation and topographic features therefore they were not fixed in epoxy resin or coated with a conductive layer uncoated sample observation was performed using a hitachi tabletop microscope tm3030 equipped with a sdd silicon drift detector 2 4 hardness testing using microindentation the hardness of polished cores was measured using the vickers hv 0 1 method and a durascan struers a s micro macro hardness tester to check the vickers hardness of cores samples were sectioned with a diamond saw metallographically mounted and polished to make the surface smooth and reflective enough to clearly resolve the microscopic hardness impression with the measuring microscope igarashi et al 1996 2 5 ph profiling the ph depth profile of concrete cores was measured using a universal indicator solution ph 3 11 from chemsupply the use of indicators to determine the altered zones of cementitious materials has been discussed in the literature before manso et al 2017 yu et al 2010 yet there is no standard test procedure for concrete ph measurement since we were interested in areas effected by acid corrosion instead of using the phenolphthalein method yu et al 2010 which is limited to a certain ph range indicator turns colorless below ph 8 2 we employed a universal ph indicator this indicator revealed acidic neutral and alkaline ph areas with different color codes the sample was cut in half the surface smoothed and then rinsed with deionized d i water prior to the test to remove any carbonation effects a few drops of ph indicator fluid were spread on each sample surface and left to dry at room temperature the stained surfaces were imaged using a leica automated microscope and the data processed using the leica application suite las ver4 4 3 results 3 1 3d visualization of cores neutron tomography is analogous to the x ray computed tomography technique practiced in hospitals for detecting broken bones in which a series of shadow radiographs are taken and a full 3d image of the object is reconstructed using a computer neutrons mainly interact with matter through absorption and scattering with atomic nuclei the neutron beam attenuation is strongly affected by the concentration of light atoms such as hydrogen the higher penetration of neutrons relative to x rays through materials such as concrete and steel permits non destructive imaging of cracks or internal structures in thicker samples than is achievable using x rays neutron tomography is therefore a valuable tool to see inside concrete cores nondestructively najjar et al 1986 de beer et al 2005 zhang et al 2017 schwarz et al 2005 dauti et al 2018 fig 2 contains images obtained from vertical slices of the 3d tomographic reconstructions of representative below flow cores obtained from each region using the neutron tomographic imaging technique dark areas represent aggregates and lighter gray areas are cement paste cp the intensity in gray color correlates with differences in attenuation of the neutron beam through each component phase in the aggregate the variations in the intensity of the lighter gray area are due to chemical and or physical density changes in the cp du plessis et al 2019 as evident by the layered appearance of the grayish cp area in fig 2a b in the untreated below flow bf core fig 2a the depth of chemical or physical density changes was more than 10 mm while in the treated bf core set b fig 2b it was found to be less than 5 mm fig 3 is a 3d reconstruction of a 2d dataset of the control core set a bf the depth of corrosion penetration of chemicals and precipitation of some elements in the crack lines of imaged cores can be visualized variation in color within each phase corresponds approximately with varying concentration of light elements such as hydrogen within that phase a classic application of this technique can be quality control of the concrete s physical condition prior to in depth imaging using techniques such as sem the colored areas in fig 3 visualize the result of the porosity analysis with volume graphics vgstudio max with the color coding assigned to the size of the voids color coding of pore volumes shows the largest pores in pink red 8 500 m3 labeled as defect and the smallest pore in blue 2 000 m3 see color legend in fig 3 both set a and set b samples have connected pores at the surface area first 5 mm and have disconnected pore structures from the depth above 10 mm the surface porosity first 5 mm is higher in set a and the medium size pores are mainly in the first 5 mm from the surface set b data not shown has a more uniform distribution of medium green color and large size pores across the sample the 3d reconstruction of a set a and set b below flow sample from 2d neutron transmission images using neutron tomography are accessible through a separate video file as supplementary material 3 2 visual examination a close look at the sectioned and polished cores obtained from the sewer pipes revealed significant differences in the formulation of the concrete used at different sites and the depth of corrosion all cores show a highly cracked area in the first 3 mm from the surface untreated set a samples appear to have the most cracks and voids examples of cores from below flows of set a and set b are shown in fig 4 the depth and pattern of corrosion the visual color change and observed layered structure is different in samples obtained from the various locations and ranges from 0 44 mm up to 7 mm below flow bf samples in general show deeper chemical penetration thicker corroded layer while roof rf corroded layers showing color dissimilarity are often very thin this may be due to the corroded layers falling off over time the set a bf specimen fig 4a also shows a number of layers of dissimilar color formed on top of the sample and that the depth of chemical penetration can be up to 7 mm the depth of corrosion in the set b bf samples fig 4b was found to be less than 3 mm and in general samples taken from this area were found to have visibly thinner corroded layers since there is no record of the level of corrosion erosion in this section prior to fecl2 dosing it is not clear if the ferrous chloride has caused there to be a thinner corroded layer or not the exposed aggregate finish seen in fig 4b suggests that the corroded layer has already been washed out with the sewage stream as an exposed aggregate surface is not a standard surface finish for a concrete pipe based on the color differences observed from the surface to the bulk of the cores samples were visually sectioned into three zones as shown in a sample core illustrated in fig 5 the breakdowns are as follow a corroded layer surface zone sz located at the darkest region on the top excluding thin biofilm layer and assumed to be the most corroded part of the sample b below corroded layer intermediate zone itz located below the visible dark region and c concrete bulk intact zone iz the visual appearance suggests that it is not affected by corrosion 3 3 cross sectional morphology and elemental distribution morphological observations were made on polished epoxy impregnated surfaces of sliced cores using a full sized sem fig 6 a and microstructural studies were made on simply sawn unpolished surfaces to preserve crack patterns and crystal structures using a tabletop sem fig 6b and c this matched the existence of three zones fig 5 within the cores consisting of a cracked and highly deteriorated surface zone with loosely bounded aggregate sz a zone of deposited corrosion products itz which in general is a layer with a distinct color adjacent to the crack lines and primarily is made up of gypsum around aggregates and penetrated ions in pores followed by a chemically unchanged zone iz which can contain some cracks at the sz of set a samples fig 6b and c the dissolution of ca2 and other hydration products from the cement paste and the ingress of s from the acid bath resulted in the formation of rectangular gypsum caso4 2h2o the secondary ettringite 3cao al2o3 3caso4 32h2o and the calcite caco3 crystals mori et al 1992 santhanam et al 2003a santhanam et al 2003b wang et al 2019 the intact zone iz of set a consists of the primary ettringite portlandite ca oh 2 and amorphous calcium silicate hydrate c s h phases höhlig et al 2017 mori et al 1992 the secondary ettringite crystals were not detected at sz of set b fig 6 but the gypsum and the calcite crystals were mainly at the sz and the calcium hydroxide c h the c s h was mainly at the iz external ions from wastewater can migrate into concrete constructions through the free passage provided by gypsum pores and cracks the penetration depth is proportional to immersion time and an increase in the number of voids and cracks ming et al 2016 bishnoi 2007 nilsen et al 1993 the elemental analysis eds of the polished epoxy impregnated cores showed major peaks arising from the o c mg al si ca zn and fe color coded maps of selected elements ca s and fe showing the distribution of elements across the polished bf sample faces are shown in fig 7 the color intensity map at different depths can be easily correlated to the type of treatment and depth of deterioration calcium concentration from the exposed surface to about 250 µm into each of the cores was found to be relatively low then increasing with depth the concentration of sulfur and iron decreases with depth elemental percentages by weight from concrete core analysis as a function of depth mm are shown in fig 8 where averaged elemental distributions for calcium sulfur and iron are plotted of the two sets of cores set a and set b the plots were also separated into below flow tidal and roof sections the elemental analysis of the concrete bulk iz versus surface concrete sz itz shows a fourfold depletion of calcium of the surface concrete compared to intact concrete bulk up to a depth of 10 mm fig 8a although not all elemental data are shown in this paper the ca2 of the surface has been replaced by other elements like s and fe fig 7 as well as mg al and zn sulfur penetration through pores and cracks can be detected in all cores fig 8b sulfur has moved deeper than 10 mm in the bf and td samples which received no treatment set a while in other samples it cannot be detected from depth of 3 4 mm onward sulfur presence is more intense around major crack lines at the surface 10 to 14 42 wt while it decreases to less than 0 52 wt in intact cement paste areas gypsum crystals plates observed in fig 6b forms during sulfate attack following the reaction between calcium hydroxide c h and sulfate ions transported to the concrete by wastewater contaminates such as na2so4 mgso4 feso4 and caso4 this could be another reason for the softer surface and deterioration pattern which will be discussed later santhanam et al 2003a monteny et al 2000 set b cores from sewer pipes carrying sewage treated with fecl2 show enhanced concentrations of iron in the first 500 µm from the surface fig 7 the fe ion penetration depth in dosed below flow samples was observed to be much deeper and can reach depths of up to 15 mm an alteration of concrete composition and formation and deposition of a fe rich layer across the first crack line is evident by sem fig 7 it is assumed that the newly formed phase is chemically more stable and therefore hinders further and more pronounced diffusion of fe into the pores the iron fe2 concentration in the composition of portland cement is around 4 weight percent wt the average concentration of fe wt detected across the first 3 mm of all samples is however higher than this average chlorine cl cannot be detected in concrete cores as the encasing resin used to prepare samples for testing also contains cl analysis of the concrete cores also revealed the presence of other elements determined by eds analysis and phase identification using aztec software data not shown magnesium has a distinct presence at the surface of all samples below the corroded layer the penetration of mg2 and the phase change of c s h calcium silicate hydrate to m s h magnesium silicate hydrate may contribute to deterioration since m s h has lower strength than c s h santhanam et al 2003b the presence of zinc in untreated set a cores on the first 800 µm2 of the surface might be part of pollutants absorbed through the pores and cracks from the sewage since zinc is not a common element in a concrete formulation nor was it observed in other samples or deeper zones of same samples the presence of a high concentration of phosphorous p at first 500 µm2 of some samples can be due to different concrete formulations the use of a different portland cement admixture or the deposition of iron phosphate 3 4 hardness measurements the cross sections of concrete cores were further assessed with a vickers hardness test to check whether changes in cement paste color observed with concrete depth could be correlated with a change in hardness the vickers hardness values obtained from corrosion impacted areas and comparing them with hardness values of intact concrete bulk are useful indicators of concrete properties and expected service behavior a decrease in hardness can be interpreted as an indication of deterioration hardness testing is a much simpler test to perform than a direct compressive or tensile strength test based on the visual sectioning of cores shown in fig 5 eight points on each core were tested points 1 to 3 which correlate to a depth of 1 2 and 3 mm from the surface of a specimen and corroded layer points 4 to 6 which correlate to a depth of 6 8 and 10 mm from the surface of a specimen and below corroded layer itz points 7 and 8 which correlate to a depth of 15 and 20 mm from the surface of a specimen and from concrete bulk iz softening of the hydrated cement matrix was observed within the first few hundred micrometers of all cores with below flow bf cores exhibiting a softer surface than tidal td and roof rf regions the difference in hardness between dosed or undosed rf regions is within the measurement error therefore we only concentrate on bf and td cores for the remainder of this section the normalized hardness results of bf and td cores is plotted in fig 9 interestingly the visual sectioning of cores corresponds with the difference in hardness values obtained from vickers method a range of 20 50 averaged data points were used for every data point shown in the hardness trend plots since concrete formulations are unknown and dissimilar data of each region were normalized against each other by assuming the hardness of the intact zone should be constant in other words all unmodified regions sit around 100 meaning the concrete matrix in this area has not been affected by corrosion the hardness at the surface zone can be seen to vary by 25 a value which depends on the core region td or bf the concrete mix age or a range of other wastewater characteristics that we haven t measured the observed hardness of the corroded layers confirms that the concrete surface has become soft and spongy and the exposed aggregate of the cores fig 4 support our theory that part of the corroded layer has already fallen off unfortunately the amount of lost matter for each core is unknown therefore it is very difficult to draw conclusions regarding the effect of chemical dosing on hardness values on average it can be seen that there is a significant change in hardness as a function of depth by more than 40 within the transition region of all cores tested for untreated sites this change occurs over a depth of 8 mm whilst at dosed sites the hardness changes over a larger depth of 12 mm the larger transition region seen for dosed cores could either be due to less corroded matter falling off these cores or that the increased uptake of fe at dosed sites fig 8 contributes to an observed thicker amount of softer material in any case this softening to concrete conduits around and below the water line correlates with field observations conducted by sydney water as mentioned above all cores show softening of the surface this softening can be correlated to calcium depletion this linear correlation is plotted in fig 10 and as can be seen the softer the area the lower the calcium presence in that area in fig 10 the calcium concentration and the hardness data acquired from dosed sites were combined with the undosed site based on the zonal map presented in fig 5 and the average value of each data point was plotted with 5 x and y error bars intact concrete zones usually have a hardness value around 60 80 with calcium content near 27 33 wt whereas surface zones have hardness values between 25 and 40 with a calcium content of 10 wt during sulfate corrosion the penetration of aggressive media leads to an increase of the porosity of the material and the damage degree the penetration depth of mg s and fe fig 7 can be also correlated to the hardness profile and considered as an indicator of concrete deterioration in sewer pipes 3 5 ph profiling as shown in fig 11 a we successfully managed to visualize areas with different ph profiles using the method described in section 2 5 fast carbonation of the exposed sample surface however is a big problem and can interfere with accurate imaging of the ph at different depths to eliminate this surface smoothening and sanding just prior to ph measurement is highly recommended all samples show a ph value less than 5 in the surface zone whilst the ph increases above 6 when moving to the intact zone set b roof samples have a corroded region ph 5 less than 3 mm with the remaining intact zone visualized by a purple color representing a ph value above 9 below flow samples show an acidic region up to a depth of 10 mm with the ph of the concrete bulk at depth above 10 mm being neutral tidal samples indicate an acidic region up to 6 mm deep and an intact zone with a ph value between 6 and 9 these results all correlate with the hardness and ca depletion results outlined earlier the ph depth profiles plotted in fig 11b d show that the first 10 mm of all cores except for dosed rf samples have a ph below neutral fig 12 plots the calcium depletion versus ph at different depths the calcium concentration data set and the ph data set acquired from the dosed sites were combined with the undosed sites based on the zonal map presented in fig 5 and the mean of each data point was plotted with 5 x and y error bars here again we see the same trend between calcium concentration and the ph the more acidic the area the lower will be the calcium presence in that area our results thus show that a low ph value can be associated with the known fact of the onset of concrete corrosion 4 discussion after analyzing the sewer pipe cores recovered from sydney s wastewater network we found that the concrete formulation greatly influenced a core s corrodibility depth and rate of corrosion and chemical penetration the corrosion front identified via ph profiling sem and tomographic imaging was found to be deeper than the visual color dissimilarity in the first few millimeters of sliced cores the major difference between the depth of corrosion in roof tidal and below flow samples suggests that different mechanisms and the rate of deterioration is based on the location of the concrete below flow concrete samples corroded the most up to 10 mm in depth whilst corrosion in roof samples was confined to a maximum depth of 6 mm these results indicate that flow and liquid penetration may play a role in the rate of corrosion and depth of chemical penetration all collected concrete cores showed a gradient feature of properties moving away from the surface and toward the intact concrete bulk parameters such as ph hardness and calcium concentration increase in a gradient fashion the depth associated with the lowest hardness coincided with the location of a calcium depleted area in the matrix as well as an area with a lower ph value hence calcium depletion and associated ph levels contribute to a decline in performance and long term durability of a concrete structure the softening in the near surface paste can also be linked to sulfate attack as well as carbonation leaching depletion or both wastewater flow and liquid penetration are also important factors when investigating species migration and corrosion rates below the water line the corrosion above the water line also follows a different mechanism therefore there is a need to consider the presence of multiple modes of deterioration in concrete structures and their potential synergistic interaction the presence of unexpected elements in elemental analysis could be a result of dissolution and precipitation of elements from the wastewater itself or due to the different concrete formulations used at different sydney water sites it must be borne in mind that the concrete cores collected were from sewers with different age and location therefore have different formulations furthermore there is an unknown amount of matter that has been lost and fallen off the surface of the retrieved cores due to either corrosion erosion whilst in situ and or from the high pressure clean that was undertaken prior to characterization once retrieved from site whilst this has made the influence of chemical dosing hard to interpret and the comparison between the cores very difficult due to a difference in the rate and mechanism of concrete corrosion our results showed that our methodologies can be used to characterize and better understand the mechanisms of sewer concrete corrosion all samples evaluated had cracks and a grayish white discolored surface as the most obvious signs of corrosion in concrete when the signs of damage become visible the extent of corrosion on the cement paste has already reached an advanced stage thus it is important to identify different stages of corrosion at different depths within a concrete sample neutron tomography serves this purpose and can be used to screen the depth and extent of corrosion non destructively the evaluation of the differences in the textures and the intensity of the gray area revealed the extent of the chemical and or physical density changes in the cement paste an in depth characterization of the concrete samples was then performed using a sem eds technique which confirmed the differences in the crystalline structures and showed the elemental composition changes in all three zones surface intermediate and intact zones due to corrosion the apparent hardness measurement helped to quantify the degree and the depth of softening in the concrete it was the ph profiling method that shed light on the early stages of corrosion in the intact zone of set a below flow ph 6 while the study of hardness and the elemental changes did not show any signs of corrosions in the intact zone of set a below flow therefore the combination of the various techniques used in this work gave a deeper understanding of the corrosion the stage of corrosion and the effect of wastewater treatment on concrete in the sewer 5 conclusion the combination of neutron tomography scanning electron microscopy with and without elementary analysis ph profiling and vickers hardness microindentation was converted into a methodology to assess concrete deterioration this approach provided a detailed understanding of the correlation between the physical and chemical mechanisms that lead to softening of the near surface paste we observed softening in the near surface zone of all 20 recovered concrete cores concrete softening was observed over a larger depth in below flow and tidal cores recovered from sites where the wastewater had been dosed with fecl2 there was also a noticeable iron uptake in cores from fecl2 dosed areas below the water line and in tidal areas which reached depths of up to 15 mm on average we detected a significant change in hardness as a function of depth in below flow and tidal areas reducing by more than 40 in the transition region this correlates with field data collected by sydney water roof samples had a smaller corroded area compared to below the water line samples and that hardness did not really change with depth nevertheless the corrosion above the water line follows a different mechanism than the below water line from the limited number of samples assessed in this project we conclude that concrete core softening correlates to a depletion in calcium and a reduction in ph the influence of fecl2 chemical dosing on concrete sewer pipes however requires further investigation declaration of competing interest the

17602,testate amoebae are widely distributed in natural ecosystems and play an important role in the material cycle and energy flow however community assembly of testate amoebae is not well understood especially with regard to the relative importance of the stochastic and deterministic processes over time in this study we used illumina high throughput sequencing to explore the community assembly of testate amoebae from surface waters in two reservoirs of subtropical china over a seven year period majority of testate amoebae belonged to the rare taxa because their relative abundances were typically lower than 0 01 of the total eukaryotic plankton community the testate amoeba community dynamics exhibited a stronger interannual than seasonal variation in both reservoirs further species richness rather than species turnover accounted for the majority of community variation environmental variables explained less than 20 of the variation in community composition of testate amoebae and the community assembly appeared to be strongly driven by stochastic processes based on the sloan neutral community model it was found that neutral processes explained more than 65 of community variation more importantly the stegen null model analysis showed that the stochastic processes e g ecological drift explained a significantly higher percentage of community assembly than deterministic processes over seven years although deterministic processes were more influential in certain years our results provide new perspectives for understanding the ecological patterns processes and mechanisms of testate amoeba communities in freshwater ecosystems at temporal scale and have important implications for monitoring plankton diversity and protecting drinking water resources graphical

amoeboid protists in which the cytoplasm is enclosed within an external shell meisterfeld 2002 mitchell et al 2008 adl et al 2019 they are widely distributed in freshwater brackish water and soil from tropical to polar regions yang et al 2010 regalado et al 2018 and they play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles and energy flow of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems wilkinson 2008 studies of testate amoebae are highly relevant for our understanding of evolutionary and ecological relationships among protists shen et al 1990 yang et al 2006 mitchell et al 2008 globally there are about 2000 described morphospecies of testate amoebae yang et al 2006 mitchell et al 2008 the shells of testate amoebae are relatively resistant to decay and are generally well preserved in lake sediments and peatlands mitchell et al 2008 therefore testate amoebae can be used to record past changes in environment mitchell et al 2008 and they are increasingly used as a biotic proxy of climate and environmental changes swindles and roe 2007 wall et al 2010 qin et al 2013b ju et al 2014 ndayishimiye et al 2019 and as biological indicators of water quality and pollution jeelani et al 2018 steele et al 2018 cockburn et al 2020 nasser et al 2020 in previous limnological studies testate amoebae have been used to reveal changes in different environmental factors such as temperature ph and salinity asioli et al 1996 patterson and kumar 2000 mattheeussen et al 2005 roe and patterson 2014 ndayishimiye et al 2019 however most of these studies have focused on wetlands and or lake sediments and are based on subfossil records swindles et al 2015 ndayishimiye et al 2019 to date research on the community structure dynamics of testate amoebae in the planktonic phase of inland water bodies across long time series more than five years has been lacking recently understanding the fundamental ecological processes underlying the assembly of microbial community has become a core topic in microbial ecology nemergut et al 2013 zhou and ning 2017 tripathi et al 2018 and the major ecological process shaping microbial eukaryotic communities is hotly debated chase 2010 powell et al 2015 chen et al 2019 ecological processes include deterministic and stochastic processes that can simultaneously influence the assembly of local communities stegen et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 chen et al 2019 in the traditional theoretical understanding of niche based processes the deterministic factors including local environmental conditions species traits and interspecies interactions e g competition predation mutualisms and tradeoffs control the composition of local communities chesson 2000 fargione et al 2003 powell et al 2015 however stochastic processes such as random birth death and dispersal events colonization extinction and speciation also play an important role for the species composition in a given locality chave 2004 fukami et al 2005 it is generally accepted that the assembly of microbial communities is regulated by deterministic and stochastic processes simultaneously chase 2010 ofiteru et al 2010 stegen et al 2013 zhou and ning 2017 chen et al 2019 the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes is influenced by the rate of species dispersal and strength of ecological selection along spatial and temporal scales caruso et al 2011 chisholm and pacala 2011 stegen et al 2012 dini andreote et al 2015 evans et al 2017 fortunately advent of high throughput sequencing techniques has revolutionized microbial ecology and these techniques now enable us to obtain detailed and comprehensive information about plankton communities by analyzing environmental samples liu et al 2017 ren et al 2018 xue et al 2018 chen et al 2019 here we used illumina high throughput sequencing to investigate the dynamics and community assembly of testate amoebae we collected 150 samples from surface waters of two subtropical reservoirs in southeast china over a period of seven years and combined community analysis with measurement of environmental variables the two reservoirs are connected with water from the higher reservoir flowing directly into the lower one the two reservoirs being separated by a dam such connectivity condition allows the comparison of results from two adjacent water bodies in this study we aim at answering the following questions 1 how does the testate amoeba community change in surface waters of subtropical reservoirs over seven years 2 what is the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in shaping the community assembly of testate amoebae 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sampling field samplings were conducted every season from 2010 to 2016 in both shidou and bantou reservoirs which are part of the xiamen reservoir time series xrt program in xiamen city of fujian province southeast china fig 1 xiamen has a subtropical monsoon climate with annual mean temperature of 20 7 c and annual mean precipitation of 1335 8 mm yang et al 2017 water temperature in the two reservoirs ranged from 14 6 to 33 4 c during the study period the shidou reservoir with a total storage capacity of 61 4 million m3 is located immediately upstream of bantou reservoir total storage capacity 4 4 million m3 the two reservoirs are separated by a dam and the water flows into bantou reservoir when the water level is high in shidou reservoir normally the water flow is very low or almost zero leading to a long water residence time the two reservoirs are important drinking water sources for xiamen city yang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 in total 150 samples were collected from the surface waters 0 5 m depth in shidou and bantou reservoirs there were 25 sampling visits from july 2010 to july 2016 for shidou and bantou reservoirs respectively water samples were taken in the months of january april july and october in each year fig 1 fig 2 table s1 replicate samples were collected from upstream midstream and downstream zones in each reservoir yang et al 2017 upstream midstream and downstream zones are riverine transitional and lacustrine zones in each reservoir respectively yang et al 2017 for each sample about 500 ml water was pre filtered through a 200 μm mesh to remove large particles and metazoans and then filtered using 0 22 μm pore size polycarbonate filters 47 mm diameter millipore billerica ma usa by using vacuum pump to reduce the likelihood of contamination the filter bowls were rinsed successively by sterile water and sample water before each sample filtering the filters were stored at 80 c until dna extraction liu et al 2017 2 2 environmental and phytoplankton information water depths of sampling sites were measured with a speedtech sm 5

total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate and nitrite nitrogen nox n total phosphorus tp and phosphate phosphorus po4 p were measured as described in our previous study liu et al 2013 phytoplankton was identified on an inverted microscope motic ae31 china using hu and wei 2006 as taxonomic reference 2 3 dna extraction and sequence processing the fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals santa ana ca usa was used to extract the total dna from filters following the manufacturer s instruction before dna extraction the filter that collected the 0 2 200 μm eukaryotic plankton was cut into small pieces using flame disinfected scissors the hypervariable v9 region of 18s rrna gene was amplified using eukaryotic primers 1380f and 1510r amaral zettler et al 2009 liu et al 2017 the pcr amplification and library construction was performed according to liu et al 2017 the 150 samples were sequenced on the illumina hiseq2500 platform illumina inc san diego ca usa using a paired end approach illumina high throughput sequencing provides a quick and effective way to obtain information of dna in environmental samples allowing the identification of testate amoebae based on the sequence similarity the original sequence data have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive sra database under the bioproject number prjna415265 and the accession number srp121028 2 4 bioinformatics low quality reads were removed with default parameters using make contigs in mothur software and merged paired end reads of the 18s rrna gene sequences were processed using vsearch 1 9 1 rognes et al 2016 quality filtered reads were assigned to operational taxonomic units otus at 97 sequence similarity threshold representative sequences from each otu were matched against the protist ribosomal reference pr2 database using the rdp classifier guillou et al 2013 de vargas et al 2015 all singletons doubletons mitochondrial sequences chloroplast sequences and unknown organisms sequences with less than 80 similarity to the protist reference sequence were removed before the downstream analyses in order to standardize the sequencing effort a randomly selected subset of 29 809 sequences from each sample was used to standardize sequencing effort and the final dataset retained 4471 350 reads at 97 similarity level here we defined the rare taxa as the otus with a relative abundance 0 01 in a sample and which never showed 1 abundance in any sample chen et al 2019 liu et al 2019 the sequences were assigned to different taxonomic groups using the pr2 database guillou et al 2013 based on the revised classification of eukaryotes adl et al 2019 we selected the taxonomic groups containing amoebae from the members of amoebozoa rhizaria and excavata and then removed the sequences of naked amoebae the final data set included 10 main categories namely amphitremida arcellinida cryomonadida cryptofilida desmothoracida euglyphida foraminifera tectofilosida thaumatomonadida and ventricleftida in total we retained 361 otus and 7808 sequences of testate amoebae from the 150 samples the otus were defined at 97 sequence similarity level at this level we can roughly treat them as species 2 5 community composition non metric multidimensional scaling nmds of testate amoeba communities was performed based on the bray curtis similarity with relative abundance of otus analysis of similarity anosim was used to investigate differences in the testate amoeba communities between groups the statistic global r represents the degree of separation between groups the beta diversity bray curtis dissimilarity of the testate amoeba community between different samples was partitioned into two components the abundance gradient richness and the balanced variation turnover using the bray part function of the betapart r package jiao et al 2017 xue et al 2018 we used time lag analysis to quantify the contributions of richness and turnover dissimilarity components to the bray curtis dissimilarity between each pair of samples to reveal temporal patterns in the testate amoeba community and the time lag was then plotted against the dissimilarity matrix using the ggplot2 r package collins et al 2000 2 6 relationships between testate amoebae and environment variables the euclidean distances of environmental variables were calculated the pairwise spearman s rank correlations r between environmental factors were calculated preliminary detrended correspondence analysis dca on the testate amoeba data revealed that the longest gradient length in shidou and bantou reservoirs was 4 42 and 7 24 3 standard deviations respectively therefore canonical correspondence analysis cca was used to explore relationships between the testate amoeba community and environmental factors to improve normality and homoscedasticity all environmental factors except ph were log x 1 transformed before analysis in order to reduce multicollinearity among environmental factors all variance inflation factors vifs were kept below 10 nakazawa and nakazawa 2017 the environmental factors influencing the composition of the testate amoeba community were selected by 999 monte carlo permutation tests at the significant level p 0 01 in addition the relative importance of water temperature physico chemical factors and nutrients were assessed using the variation partitioning analysis vpa mantel test was also used to investigate the correlations between euclidean distance of environmental factors and bray curtis dissimilarity of communities these analyses were performed using the software packages canoco for windows 4 5 ter braak and smilauer 2002 and the vegan package in r software version 3 4 3 oksanen et al 2018 we further explored the relationships between physico chemical factors nutrients phytoplankton and testate amoeba richness using a partial least squares path modeling pls pm in the r plspm package wang et al 2016 gao et al 2019 this model is well known to estimate the complex cause effect relationships between multiple variables four groups of variables were used physico chemical factors water depth transparency water temperature ph dissolved oxygen turbidity electrical conductivity oxidation reduction potential and water level fluctuations nutrients total carbon total organic carbon total nitrogen ammonium nitrogen nitrate and nitrite nitrogen total phosphorus and phosphate phosphorus phytoplankton abundance ind l of bacillariophyta chlorophyta chrysophyta cryptophyta cyanobacteria euglenophyta pyrrophyta and xanthophyta and richness of the testate amoeba communities the otus number of testate amoebae we ran pls pm using 999 bootstraps to test the direct and indirect effects of predictor variables on the testate amoebae path coefficients reflect the direction and strength of the linear relationships between variables and indirect effects include the multiplied path coefficients between a predictor and a response variable the goodness of fit index gof was used to evaluate the performance of the model sanchez 2013 2 7 community assembly the contributions of neutral or stochastic processes to testate amoeba community assembly were assessed using the sloan neutral community model ncm which can generate the best fit distribution curve with least squares method sloan et al 2006 the random immigrations births and deaths are assumed to determine the relative abundance of taxa in a metacommunity this model predicts the relationship between occurrence frequency of individuals otus and mean relative abundance in the metacommunity sloan et al 2006 the n describes the metacommunity size and m estimates immigration rate chen et al 2019 the estimated immigration rate can be interpreted as a measure of dispersal limitation all analyses were performed in r version 3 4 3 r core team 2017 in order to better understand the mechanisms underlying the community assembly of testate amoebae we evaluated the contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes to community assembly using the stegen null model stegen et al 2013 tripathi et al 2018 this model uses the phylogenetic trees to estimate the process of each pairwise turnover for testate amoebae otus stegen et al 2013 the null model has recently received much attention in microbial ecology zhou et al 2014 tripathi et al 2018 in this study approximately maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree constructed with the sequences of representative otus was used the phylogenetic signal occurs when more closely related species are more ecologically similar and it was used to quantitatively estimate the percentage of compositional turnover linked to deterministic and stochastic processes webb et al 2002 kembel et al 2010 evans et al 2017 we calculated the pairwise phylogenetic turnover between communities using the β mean nearest taxon distance βmntd based on the stegen null model of picante package in r 3 4 3 webb et al 2002 stegen et al 2013 the β nearest taxon index βnti is the difference between observed βmntd and mean of the null distribution of βmntd normalized with its standard deviation the relative contribution of variable selection and homogeneous selection was estimated from the percentage of pairwise comparisons whose βntis were 2 and 2 respectively we further calculated the bray curtis based raup crick index rcbray to investigate pairwise comparisons that deviated from selection stegen et al 2013 the relative contribution of dispersal limitation was estimated as the percentage of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 the relative contribution of homogenizing dispersal was estimated as the percentage of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 the ecological drift was therefore estimated as the percentage of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 dini andreote et al 2015 tripathi et al 2018 the generalized additive model gam was used to evaluate the effects of seven years on βmntd and βnti across all datasets in shidou and bantou reservoirs respectively the gam was fitted using the mgcv r package wood 2016 we used integrated smoothness estimation for each explanatory variable and study site as a random factor tripathi et al 2018 3 results 3 1 composition and diversity of testate amoeba communities from the 150 samples of shidou 75 samples and bantou 75 samples reservoirs we obtained 4471 350 high quality sequences of the 18s rrna gene of eukaryotic plankton these sequences clustered into 13 311 otus at 97 similarity level and were distributed among nine super groups of eukaryotes fig s1 the percentage of testate amoebae in the total eukaryotic community was 2 61 of otus and 0 16 of sequences for the shidou reservoir and 2 43 of otus and 0 19 of sequences for the bantou reservoir respectively fig s2 the sequences were mainly belonged to the lineages amoebozoa arcellinida and rhizaria cryomonadida cryptofilida desmothoracida euglyphida foraminifera tectofilosida thaumatomonadida and ventricleftida with lower numbers from stramenopiles amphitremida fig 2 the nmds results showed that the difference in the testate amoeba community was non significant between shidou and bantou reservoirs p 0 20 fig s3 however the interannual variations of the testate amoeba communities were significantly greater than seasonal variations in both shidou and bantou reservoirs mann whitney u test p 0 01 the results of anosim test further confirmed the significant interannual changes of the testate amoeba community from 2010 to 2016 table 1 clearly the number of otus in both reservoirs varied greatly over time fig 2 the shared number of otus 209 from shidou and bantou reservoirs accounted for 73 6 and 73 1 of total richness respectively fig 2a the time lag regression showed that the community dissimilarity increased at the beginning and then declined indicating that the testate amoeba community first underwent a directional change followed by a convergent change later in the sampling period fig 3 partitioning of beta diversity further revealed that species richness richness rather than species replacement turnover accounted for the majority of the changes in community dissimilarity over time fig 3 the community of testate amoebae showed recoverability in both reservoirs especially with regard to temporal community changes contributed by the species richness 3 2 relationship between the testate amoeba community and environmental variables the environmental stability of the two reservoirs was evaluated by the euclidean distance the euclidean distance was slightly larger in shidou than in bantou reservoirs indicating that the environments were more stable in bantou reservoir fig s4a spearman correlations among environmental factors revealed that there were 42 significant correlations in shidou reservoir 22 positive and 20 negative and 37 significant correlations in bantou reservoir 16 positive and 21 negative fig s4b based on the anosim test difference of the environmental factors between two reservoirs global r 0 059 p 0 01 was very minor but statistically significant however there was no any significant difference among the environmental factors of upstream midstream and downstream within each of reservoir table s2 more importantly we found that the transparency water temperature ph dissolved oxygen electrical conductivity and total nitrogen had significant effects on the testate amoeba community in shidou reservoir p 0 01 fig 4 a in bantou reservoir the significant environmental factors included water depth water temperature chlorophyll a electrical conductivity total nitrogen tn and phosphate phosphorus fig 4b the variation partition analysis vpa indicated that all environmental factors explained 12 15 of testate amoeba community variability in shidou and bantou reservoirs fig 4c d nutrients had the highest effects on the testate amoeba communities among the environmental factors in both reservoirs fig 4c d combined with a mantel test we found that water temperature had stronger effects on testate amoeba communities in bantou than shidou reservoirs fig 4c d table s3 in the partial least squares path model the physico chemical factors nutrients and phytoplankton communities had positive direct effects on the testate amoeba richness in shidou reservoir however those variables had negative direct effects on the testate amoeba richness in bantou reservoir fig s5 3 3 the community assembly of testate amoebae the testate amoeba community in both shidou and bantou reservoirs showed a good fit to the sloan neutral community model fig s6 neutral processes explained 65 66 of the community variation fig s6a b and more than 90 of the otus could be predicted as neutrally distributed otus with 95 confidence fig s6c the gam analysis based on the null model showed that the βmntd was significantly related to the time lag values p 0 01 fig s7a b the general patterns of changes in the testate amoeba community were similar between shidou and bantou reservoirs however there were some minor differences in shidou reservoir the βmntd values increased from the time lag 0 to 44 months and exhibited a sharp decline when time lag 44 months in bantou reservoir the βmntd values increased from the time lag 0 to 26 months and exhibited a gradual decline during time lag 26 44 months and abrupt decrease after the 44th month fig s7 we further explored the relationship between βnti and successional times and obtained similar trends to βmntd in shidou and bantou reservoirs the βnti distributions gradually shifted over times lag most in stochastic community assembly βnti 2 fig s8 then we quantified the contributions of the deterministic e g homogeneous selection and variable selection and stochastic e g dispersal limitation homogenizing dispersal and ecological drift processes to the assembly of the testate amoeba community using βnti and rcbray values across different years the results showed that most βnti and rcbray values ranged from 2 to 2 and 0 95 to 0 95 respectively fig s9 this suggested that the community assembly of testate amoebae was primarily controlled by stochastic rather than deterministic processes in all seven years overall the stochastic processes dispersal limitation homogenizing dispersal and ecological drift accounted for 83 and 85 of the community assembly processes in shidou and bantou reservoirs over seven years respectively fig 5 there were some differences between different years and the deterministic processes were more influential in certain years e g 2013 and 2016 in shidou reservoir and 2016 in bantou reservoir fig 5 in shidou reservoir the stochastic processes mainly ecological drift had a relatively higher contribution in 2011 2012 2014 and 2015 however in 2010 2013 and 2016 the deterministic processes mainly homogeneous selection 33 58 and 61 for each of the three years respectively contributed relatively more fig 5 top in bantou reservoir the stochastic processes mainly ecological drift had a relatively higher contribution in 2011 2013 2014 and 2015 however in 2010 2012 and 2016 the deterministic processes mainly homogeneous selection 33 35 and 47 showed a high contribution to the community assembly fig 5 bottom moreover in order to assess if our results were biased by the inclusion of samples from different periods we chose different sampling periods to explore the variation of community assembly of testate amoebae the analyses further confirmed that the community assembly of testate amoebae was primarily controlled by stochastic rather than deterministic processes over two years 2013 2014 or four years 2013 2014 2015 2016 fig s10 as seen for the analysis over seven year period fig 5 4 discussion the temporal dynamic of testate amoeba communities in inland waters is not well described especially in freshwater reservoirs the use of deep high throughput sequencing now allows us to quickly and effectively obtain more biological information also of the relatively rare taxa in the plankton communities logares et al 2013 xue et al 2018 chen et al 2019 here we used this approach to explore the community changes of testate amoebae their driving factors and mechanisms of community assembly in two subtropical reservoirs over seven years 4 1 interannual and seasonal variability in testate amoeba communities in reservoirs in contrast to previous studies focusing only on testate amoebae based on the microscopic approach yang et al 2010 qin et al 2013a ju et al 2014 nasser et al 2019 here we first quantified the percentages of testate amoebae in the whole eukaryotic plankton and found that the majority of the testate amoebae belonged to rare low abundance taxa of the plankton communities the difference in community composition between the two reservoirs was not significant fig 2a fig s3 which is probably due to the high connectivity between the reservoirs previous long term studies were not able to detect repeated seasonal trends in the dynamics of phytoplankton or zooplankton communities from freshwater lakes anneville et al 2002 rettig et al 2006 similar results were obtained in our study since the interannual differences in the composition of testate amoeba communities were stronger than the seasonal repeated patterns table 1 this suggested that the influence of the unpredictable interannual variation in climate change and human activities on testate amoeba community might exceed their ability to recover from the seasonal variations in this study the variations of climate factors mainly included rainfall warming and cooling events and they varied among different years yang et al 2017 we further partitioned the beta diversity into species richness and species replacement components to quantify the key process driving the community dynamics of testate amoebae fig 3 interestingly the species richness contributed more variation than species turnover in driving the dynamics of testate amoeba community composition in contrast xue et al 2018 found that the species turnover explained a higher percentage of the eukaryotic plankton communities following a reservoir cyanobacterial bloom therefore variability in taxonomic group or level environmental gradients and temporal scale must be considered when investigating the key mechanisms of eukaryotic community dynamics moreover the recoverability can also be described as the resilience to an alternative stable state following an environmental change moustaka gouni et al 2006 resilience is often defined as the degree to which a system returns to pre disturbance conditions in state or function after a disturbance or perturbation konopka et al 2015 here we found that the testate amoeba community exhibited some recoverability over seven years which is similar to the findings of other studies of eukaryotic microbial communities in freshwater or marine ecosystems kim et al 2014 brannock et al 2016 liu et al 2019 4 2 minor influence of environmental variables on the testate amoeba community over seven years the water environmental conditions were relatively more stable in bantou than in shidou reservoirs fig s4 this may be due to the fact that shidou reservoir is located upstream of bantou reservoir and the former was subjected to more external disturbance yang et al 2017 the external disturbance perhaps refers to the water source of the reservoirs in shidou reservoir the water originates from several tributaries whereas the water in bantou reservoir mainly comes from shidou reservoir the difference of environmental factors between two reservoirs was minor but significant global r 0 059 p 0 01 generally the local testate amoeba community can respond differently to different environmental conditions qin et al 2013a regalado et al 2018 ndayishimiye et al 2019 although the difference of testate amoeba community composition was not significant between shidou and bantou reservoirs environmental factors influenced testate amoebae in different or complex ways in this study first the transparency water temperature ph dissolved oxygen electrical conductivity and total nitrogen were significant variables in shaping the testate amoeba community in shidou reservoir however water depth water temperature chlorophyll ɑ electrical conductivity total nitrogen and phosphate phosphorus were significant variables in bantou reservoir fig 4a b in addition the water temperature had slightly higher importance for the testate amoeba community in bantou than shidou reservoirs fig 4c d second many studies have shown that the physico chemical factors and nutrients have both direct and indirect effects on microeukaryotic and bacterial communities in aquatic ecosystems powell et al 2015 wang et al 2016 ren et al 2018 xue et al 2018 in our two reservoirs the testate amoeba communities were also impacted by both direct and indirect effects from the physico chemical factors and nutrients as indicated by the partial least squares model fig s5 nevertheless only up to 15 of the community variation could be explained by measured environmental variables in our vpa analysis this indicated that these environmental factors or deterministic processes played a minor role in community assembly of the testate amoebae over seven years recently stochastic processes shaped microeukaryotic community assembly was reported across wet and dry seasons in a subtropical river by chen et al 2019 in addition the large unexplained community variation in this study could also be due to the absence of some important environmental factors that were not taken into account in the vpa 4 3 the community assembly of testate amoebae driven by stochastic processes in general both deterministic and stochastic processes occur simultaneously in the assembly of local communities chase 2010 ofiteru et al 2010 xue et al 2018 chen et al 2019 it is a central goal in ecology to quantify the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes for the assembly of microbial communities morrison whittle and goddard 2015 zhou and ning 2017 our results clearly indicated that the stochastic processes are more important than deterministic processes for the assembly of the testate amoeba communities in the two subtropical reservoirs over seven years fig 5 hence in our study the environmental variables could only explain a minor part of the variation in the testate amoeba communities in this study the testate amoeba community showed a good fit to the neutral community model which explained over 65 of the frequency distribution of the testate amoeba taxa in the two reservoirs fig s6 this means that community assembly could be mainly shaped by stochastic processes this conclusion is supported by the results of xue et al 2018 which indicated that the stochastic processes are particularly pronounced for the rare eukaryotic plankton further in the stegen null model results the stochastic processes mainly ecological drift explained over 80 of the community variation in the seven year succession whereas the deterministic processes explained less than 20 community variation in the two reservoirs fig 5 combined with the assessment of the neutral model this result further corroborated the importance of stochastic processes for community assembly of testate amoebae the importance of stochastic processes was previously illustrated for other eukaryotic microbial communities from subtropical rivers and reservoirs ren et al 2018 chen et al 2019 in addition we found that the contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes to the community assembly fluctuated across different years for example the community assembly of testate amoebae was almost completely explained by stochastic processes for shidou reservoir in 2011 this may be due to the relocation of local residents in the upper reaches and the water quality improvement in 2010 yang et al 2017 total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and comprehensive trophic state index tsic showed a significant decrease after human population emigration in late 2010 yang et al 2017 the people emigration could have reduced the impact or stress of environmental factors on the testate amoeba community which in turn led to an increased contribution of the stochastic processes to the community assembly anthropogenic influence can cause disturbance of the water environment for example by increasing the nutrients and promoting cyanobacterial bloom such changes can strongly affect the community assembly of plankton communities liu et al 2019 in 2016 however the contribution of the deterministic processes mainly from the homogeneous selection of environmental factors to community assembly of testate amoebae increased significantly suggesting that the response of the community to environmental homogeneous selection was delayed perhaps due to the cyanobacterial bloom in 2015 fig 5 yang et al 2017 liu et al 2019 reservoir ecosystems are typically subject to disturbances of different frequencies and intensities natural communities are usually not in equilibrium and temporal snapshots can be heavily influenced by short term variations for example storm and flooding events lin and patel 2008 perdomo et al 2012 luo et al 2015 in order to assess if our results were biased by the inclusion of samples from different periods we performed a second null model analysis only including samples from two or four year periods fig s10 the results were almost identical to those of the full data set over all seven years and confirmed that the community assembly of testate amoebae was primarily controlled by stochastic rather than deterministic processes overall the stochastic processes were the main driving force or mechanism for community assembly of testate amoebae in the two subtropical reservoirs but relative contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes exhibited a high degree of fluctuation between individual years in addition our results may potentially challenge the accuracy of the traditional model or transfer functions employing testate amoeba communities as indicators for reconstruction of the past environment or climate based on a single sediment core sample to improve the accuracy of the model or transfer functions more community assembly processes and ecological factors should be taken into account therefore the increased understanding of the processes governing the community assembly of testate amoebae may have important implications for monitoring plankton diversity and protecting the water resources especially drinking water conservation management in the anthropocene 5 conclusions we highlighted the importance of stochastic processes in shaping the testate amoeba community from inland waters for the first time our study provides a better understanding of long term dynamic patterns processes and mechanisms underlying the testate amoeba community in two subtropical reservoirs we found that the majority of testate amoebae belonged to the rare eukaryotic plankton because they had a relative abundance 0 01 in the plankton community in both reservoirs the testate amoeba communities exhibited a stronger interannual variation than seasonal change and they first showed a directional change then a convergent change from 2010 to 2016 further species richness rather than species turnover accounted for the majority of community variation more than 85 of community variation could not be explained by our measured environmental variables over the seven year period stochastic processes appeared to play a more important role in the structuring of testate amoeba community however the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes varied greatly among the seven successional years altogether our results indicate that both stochastic and deterministic processes can influence the community assembly of testate amoebae but the stochastic processes e g ecological drift appear to be the dominant mechanism in this study therefore we should consider the importance of stochastic processes as well as the disturbance caused by climate change and human activities when designing studies

17602,testate amoebae are widely distributed in natural ecosystems and play an important role in the material cycle and energy flow however community assembly of testate amoebae is not well understood especially with regard to the relative importance of the stochastic and deterministic processes over time in this study we used illumina high throughput sequencing to explore the community assembly of testate amoebae from surface waters in two reservoirs of subtropical china over a seven year period majority of testate amoebae belonged to the rare taxa because their relative abundances were typically lower than 0 01 of the total eukaryotic plankton community the testate amoeba community dynamics exhibited a stronger interannual than seasonal variation in both reservoirs further species richness rather than species turnover accounted for the majority of community variation environmental variables explained less than 20 of the variation in community composition of testate amoebae and the community assembly appeared to be strongly driven by stochastic processes based on the sloan neutral community model it was found that neutral processes explained more than 65 of community variation more importantly the stegen null model analysis showed that the stochastic processes e g ecological drift explained a significantly higher percentage of community assembly than deterministic processes over seven years although deterministic processes were more influential in certain years our results provide new perspectives for understanding the ecological patterns processes and mechanisms of testate amoeba communities in freshwater ecosystems at temporal scale and have important implications for monitoring plankton diversity and protecting drinking water resources graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords community ecology freshwater plankton community assembly null model ecological drift 1 introduction testate amoebae are a polyphyletic group of single celled amoeboid protists in which the cytoplasm is enclosed within an external shell meisterfeld 2002 mitchell et al 2008 adl et al 2019 they are widely distributed in freshwater brackish water and soil from tropical to polar regions yang et al 2010 regalado et al 2018 and they play an important role in the biogeochemical cycles and energy flow of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems wilkinson 2008 studies of testate amoebae are highly relevant for our understanding of evolutionary and ecological relationships among protists shen et al 1990 yang et al 2006 mitchell et al 2008 globally there are about 2000 described morphospecies of testate amoebae yang et al 2006 mitchell et al 2008 the shells of testate amoebae are relatively resistant to decay and are generally well preserved in lake sediments and peatlands mitchell et al 2008 therefore testate amoebae can be used to record past changes in environment mitchell et al 2008 and they are increasingly used as a biotic proxy of climate and environmental changes swindles and roe 2007 wall et al 2010 qin et al 2013b ju et al 2014 ndayishimiye et al 2019 and as biological indicators of water quality and pollution jeelani et al 2018 steele et al 2018 cockburn et al 2020 nasser et al 2020 in previous limnological studies testate amoebae have been used to reveal changes in different environmental factors such as temperature ph and salinity asioli et al 1996 patterson and kumar 2000 mattheeussen et al 2005 roe and patterson 2014 ndayishimiye et al 2019 however most of these studies have focused on wetlands and or lake sediments and are based on subfossil records swindles et al 2015 ndayishimiye et al 2019 to date research on the community structure dynamics of testate amoebae in the planktonic phase of inland water bodies across long time series more than five years has been lacking recently understanding the fundamental ecological processes underlying the assembly of microbial community has become a core topic in microbial ecology nemergut et al 2013 zhou and ning 2017 tripathi et al 2018 and the major ecological process shaping microbial eukaryotic communities is hotly debated chase 2010 powell et al 2015 chen et al 2019 ecological processes include deterministic and stochastic processes that can simultaneously influence the assembly of local communities stegen et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 chen et al 2019 in the traditional theoretical understanding of niche based processes the deterministic factors including local environmental conditions species traits and interspecies interactions e g competition predation mutualisms and tradeoffs control the composition of local communities chesson 2000 fargione et al 2003 powell et al 2015 however stochastic processes such as random birth death and dispersal events colonization extinction and speciation also play an important role for the species composition in a given locality chave 2004 fukami et al 2005 it is generally accepted that the assembly of microbial communities is regulated by deterministic and stochastic processes simultaneously chase 2010 ofiteru et al 2010 stegen et al 2013 zhou and ning 2017 chen et al 2019 the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes is influenced by the rate of species dispersal and strength of ecological selection along spatial and temporal scales caruso et al 2011 chisholm and pacala 2011 stegen et al 2012 dini andreote et al 2015 evans et al 2017 fortunately advent of high throughput sequencing techniques has revolutionized microbial ecology and these techniques now enable us to obtain detailed and comprehensive information about plankton communities by analyzing environmental samples liu et al 2017 ren et al 2018 xue et al 2018 chen et al 2019 here we used illumina high throughput sequencing to investigate the dynamics and community assembly of testate amoebae we collected 150 samples from surface waters of two subtropical reservoirs in southeast china over a period of seven years and combined community analysis with measurement of environmental variables the two reservoirs are connected with water from the higher reservoir flowing directly into the lower one the two reservoirs being separated by a dam such connectivity condition allows the comparison of results from two adjacent water bodies in this study we aim at answering the following questions 1 how does the testate amoeba community change in surface waters of subtropical reservoirs over seven years 2 what is the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in shaping the community assembly of testate amoebae 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sampling field samplings were conducted every season from 2010 to 2016 in both shidou and bantou reservoirs which are part of the xiamen reservoir time series xrt program in xiamen city of fujian province southeast china fig 1 xiamen has a subtropical monsoon climate with annual mean temperature of 20 7 c and annual mean precipitation of 1335 8 mm yang et al 2017 water temperature in the two reservoirs ranged from 14 6 to 33 4 c during the study period the shidou reservoir with a total storage capacity of 61 4 million m3 is located immediately upstream of bantou reservoir total storage capacity 4 4 million m3 the two reservoirs are separated by a dam and the water flows into bantou reservoir when the water level is high in shidou reservoir normally the water flow is very low or almost zero leading to a long water residence time the two reservoirs are important drinking water sources for xiamen city yang et al 2016 yang et al 2017 in total 150 samples were collected from the surface waters 0 5 m depth in shidou and bantou reservoirs there were 25 sampling visits from july 2010 to july 2016 for shidou and bantou reservoirs respectively water samples were taken in the months of january april july and october in each year fig 1 fig 2 table s1 replicate samples were collected from upstream midstream and downstream zones in each reservoir yang et al 2017 upstream midstream and downstream zones are riverine transitional and lacustrine zones in each reservoir respectively yang et al 2017 for each sample about 500 ml water was pre filtered through a 200 μm mesh to remove large particles and metazoans and then filtered using 0 22 μm pore size polycarbonate filters 47 mm diameter millipore billerica ma usa by using vacuum pump to reduce the likelihood of contamination the filter bowls were rinsed successively by sterile water and sample water before each sample filtering the filters were stored at 80 c until dna extraction liu et al 2017 2 2 environmental and phytoplankton information water depths of sampling sites were measured with a speedtech sm 5 depthmate portable sounder speedtech instruments great falls va usa and water transparency was measured with a secchi disk we used a water quality analyzer hydrolab ds5 hach company loveland co usa to

total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate and nitrite nitrogen nox n total phosphorus tp and phosphate phosphorus po4 p were measured as described in our previous study liu et al 2013 phytoplankton was identified on an inverted microscope motic ae31 china using hu and wei 2006 as taxonomic reference 2 3 dna extraction and sequence processing the fastdna spin kit mp biomedicals santa ana ca usa was used to extract the total dna from filters following the manufacturer s instruction before dna extraction the filter that collected the 0 2 200 μm eukaryotic plankton was cut into small pieces using flame disinfected scissors the hypervariable v9 region of 18s rrna gene was amplified using eukaryotic primers 1380f and 1510r amaral zettler et al 2009 liu et al 2017 the pcr amplification and library construction was performed according to liu et al 2017 the 150 samples were sequenced on the illumina hiseq2500 platform illumina inc san diego ca usa using a paired end approach illumina high throughput sequencing provides a quick and effective way to obtain information of dna in environmental samples allowing the identification of testate amoebae based on the sequence similarity the original sequence data have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive sra database under the bioproject number prjna415265 and the accession number srp121028 2 4 bioinformatics low quality reads were removed with default parameters using make contigs in mothur software and merged paired end reads of the 18s rrna gene sequences were processed using vsearch 1 9 1 rognes et al 2016 quality filtered reads were assigned to operational taxonomic units otus at 97 sequence similarity threshold representative sequences from each otu were matched against the protist ribosomal reference pr2 database using the rdp classifier guillou et al 2013 de vargas et al 2015 all singletons doubletons mitochondrial sequences chloroplast sequences and unknown organisms sequences with less than 80 similarity to the protist reference sequence were removed before the downstream analyses in order to standardize the sequencing effort a randomly selected subset of 29 809 sequences from each sample was used to standardize sequencing effort and the final dataset retained 4471 350 reads at 97 similarity level here we defined the rare taxa as the otus with a relative abundance 0 01 in a sample and which never showed 1 abundance in any sample chen et al 2019 liu et al 2019 the sequences were assigned to different taxonomic groups using the pr2 database guillou et al 2013 based on the revised classification of eukaryotes adl et al 2019 we selected the taxonomic groups containing amoebae from the members of amoebozoa rhizaria and excavata and then removed the sequences of naked amoebae the final data set included 10 main categories namely amphitremida arcellinida cryomonadida cryptofilida desmothoracida euglyphida foraminifera tectofilosida thaumatomonadida and ventricleftida in total we retained 361 otus and 7808 sequences of testate amoebae from the 150 samples the otus were defined at 97 sequence similarity level at this level we can roughly treat them as species 2 5 community composition non metric multidimensional scaling nmds of testate amoeba communities was performed based on the bray curtis similarity with relative abundance of otus analysis of similarity anosim was used to investigate differences in the testate amoeba communities between groups the statistic global r represents the degree of separation between groups the beta diversity bray curtis dissimilarity of the testate amoeba community between different samples was partitioned into two components the abundance gradient richness and the balanced variation turnover using the bray part function of the betapart r package jiao et al 2017 xue et al 2018 we used time lag analysis to quantify the contributions of richness and turnover dissimilarity components to the bray curtis dissimilarity between each pair of samples to reveal temporal patterns in the testate amoeba community and the time lag was then plotted against the dissimilarity matrix using the ggplot2 r package collins et al 2000 2 6 relationships between testate amoebae and environment variables the euclidean distances of environmental variables were calculated the pairwise spearman s rank correlations r between environmental factors were calculated preliminary detrended correspondence analysis dca on the testate amoeba data revealed that the longest gradient length in shidou and bantou reservoirs was 4 42 and 7 24 3 standard deviations respectively therefore canonical correspondence analysis cca was used to explore relationships between the testate amoeba community and environmental factors to improve normality and homoscedasticity all environmental factors except ph were log x 1 transformed before analysis in order to reduce multicollinearity among environmental factors all variance inflation factors vifs were kept below 10 nakazawa and nakazawa 2017 the environmental factors influencing the composition of the testate amoeba community were selected by 999 monte carlo permutation tests at the significant level p 0 01 in addition the relative importance of water temperature physico chemical factors and nutrients were assessed using the variation partitioning analysis vpa mantel test was also used to investigate the correlations between euclidean distance of environmental factors and bray curtis dissimilarity of communities these analyses were performed using the software packages canoco for windows 4 5 ter braak and smilauer 2002 and the vegan package in r software version 3 4 3 oksanen et al 2018 we further explored the relationships between physico chemical factors nutrients phytoplankton and testate amoeba richness using a partial least squares path modeling pls pm in the r plspm package wang et al 2016 gao et al 2019 this model is well known to estimate the complex cause effect relationships between multiple variables four groups of variables were used physico chemical factors water depth transparency water temperature ph dissolved oxygen turbidity electrical conductivity oxidation reduction potential and water level fluctuations nutrients total carbon total organic carbon total nitrogen ammonium nitrogen nitrate and nitrite nitrogen total phosphorus and phosphate phosphorus phytoplankton abundance ind l of bacillariophyta chlorophyta chrysophyta cryptophyta cyanobacteria euglenophyta pyrrophyta and xanthophyta and richness of the testate amoeba communities the otus number of testate amoebae we ran pls pm using 999 bootstraps to test the direct and indirect effects of predictor variables on the testate amoebae path coefficients reflect the direction and strength of the linear relationships between variables and indirect effects include the multiplied path coefficients between a predictor and a response variable the goodness of fit index gof was used to evaluate the performance of the model sanchez 2013 2 7 community assembly the contributions of neutral or stochastic processes to testate amoeba community assembly were assessed using the sloan neutral community model ncm which can generate the best fit distribution curve with least squares method sloan et al 2006 the random immigrations births and deaths are assumed to determine the relative abundance of taxa in a metacommunity this model predicts the relationship between occurrence frequency of individuals otus and mean relative abundance in the metacommunity sloan et al 2006 the n describes the metacommunity size and m estimates immigration rate chen et al 2019 the estimated immigration rate can be interpreted as a measure of dispersal limitation all analyses were performed in r version 3 4 3 r core team 2017 in order to better understand the mechanisms underlying the community assembly of testate amoebae we evaluated the contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes to community assembly using the stegen null model stegen et al 2013 tripathi et al 2018 this model uses the phylogenetic trees to estimate the process of each pairwise turnover for testate amoebae otus stegen et al 2013 the null model has recently received much attention in microbial ecology zhou et al 2014 tripathi et al 2018 in this study approximately maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree constructed with the sequences of representative otus was used the phylogenetic signal occurs when more closely related species are more ecologically similar and it was used to quantitatively estimate the percentage of compositional turnover linked to deterministic and stochastic processes webb et al 2002 kembel et al 2010 evans et al 2017 we calculated the pairwise phylogenetic turnover between communities using the β mean nearest taxon distance βmntd based on the stegen null model of picante package in r 3 4 3 webb et al 2002 stegen et al 2013 the β nearest taxon index βnti is the difference between observed βmntd and mean of the null distribution of βmntd normalized with its standard deviation the relative contribution of variable selection and homogeneous selection was estimated from the percentage of pairwise comparisons whose βntis were 2 and 2 respectively we further calculated the bray curtis based raup crick index rcbray to investigate pairwise comparisons that deviated from selection stegen et al 2013 the relative contribution of dispersal limitation was estimated as the percentage of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 the relative contribution of homogenizing dispersal was estimated as the percentage of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 the ecological drift was therefore estimated as the percentage of pairwise comparisons with βnti 2 and rcbray 0 95 dini andreote et al 2015 tripathi et al 2018 the generalized additive model gam was used to evaluate the effects of seven years on βmntd and βnti across all datasets in shidou and bantou reservoirs respectively the gam was fitted using the mgcv r package wood 2016 we used integrated smoothness estimation for each explanatory variable and study site as a random factor tripathi et al 2018 3 results 3 1 composition and diversity of testate amoeba communities from the 150 samples of shidou 75 samples and bantou 75 samples reservoirs we obtained 4471 350 high quality sequences of the 18s rrna gene of eukaryotic plankton these sequences clustered into 13 311 otus at 97 similarity level and were distributed among nine super groups of eukaryotes fig s1 the percentage of testate amoebae in the total eukaryotic community was 2 61 of otus and 0 16 of sequences for the shidou reservoir and 2 43 of otus and 0 19 of sequences for the bantou reservoir respectively fig s2 the sequences were mainly belonged to the lineages amoebozoa arcellinida and rhizaria cryomonadida cryptofilida desmothoracida euglyphida foraminifera tectofilosida thaumatomonadida and ventricleftida with lower numbers from stramenopiles amphitremida fig 2 the nmds results showed that the difference in the testate amoeba community was non significant between shidou and bantou reservoirs p 0 20 fig s3 however the interannual variations of the testate amoeba communities were significantly greater than seasonal variations in both shidou and bantou reservoirs mann whitney u test p 0 01 the results of anosim test further confirmed the significant interannual changes of the testate amoeba community from 2010 to 2016 table 1 clearly the number of otus in both reservoirs varied greatly over time fig 2 the shared number of otus 209 from shidou and bantou reservoirs accounted for 73 6 and 73 1 of total richness respectively fig 2a the time lag regression showed that the community dissimilarity increased at the beginning and then declined indicating that the testate amoeba community first underwent a directional change followed by a convergent change later in the sampling period fig 3 partitioning of beta diversity further revealed that species richness richness rather than species replacement turnover accounted for the majority of the changes in community dissimilarity over time fig 3 the community of testate amoebae showed recoverability in both reservoirs especially with regard to temporal community changes contributed by the species richness 3 2 relationship between the testate amoeba community and environmental variables the environmental stability of the two reservoirs was evaluated by the euclidean distance the euclidean distance was slightly larger in shidou than in bantou reservoirs indicating that the environments were more stable in bantou reservoir fig s4a spearman correlations among environmental factors revealed that there were 42 significant correlations in shidou reservoir 22 positive and 20 negative and 37 significant correlations in bantou reservoir 16 positive and 21 negative fig s4b based on the anosim test difference of the environmental factors between two reservoirs global r 0 059 p 0 01 was very minor but statistically significant however there was no any significant difference among the environmental factors of upstream midstream and downstream within each of reservoir table s2 more importantly we found that the transparency water temperature ph dissolved oxygen electrical conductivity and total nitrogen had significant effects on the testate amoeba community in shidou reservoir p 0 01 fig 4 a in bantou reservoir the significant environmental factors included water depth water temperature chlorophyll a electrical conductivity total nitrogen tn and phosphate phosphorus fig 4b the variation partition analysis vpa indicated that all environmental factors explained 12 15 of testate amoeba community variability in shidou and bantou reservoirs fig 4c d nutrients had the highest effects on the testate amoeba communities among the environmental factors in both reservoirs fig 4c d combined with a mantel test we found that water temperature had stronger effects on testate amoeba communities in bantou than shidou reservoirs fig 4c d table s3 in the partial least squares path model the physico chemical factors nutrients and phytoplankton communities had positive direct effects on the testate amoeba richness in shidou reservoir however those variables had negative direct effects on the testate amoeba richness in bantou reservoir fig s5 3 3 the community assembly of testate amoebae the testate amoeba community in both shidou and bantou reservoirs showed a good fit to the sloan neutral community model fig s6 neutral processes explained 65 66 of the community variation fig s6a b and more than 90 of the otus could be predicted as neutrally distributed otus with 95 confidence fig s6c the gam analysis based on the null model showed that the βmntd was significantly related to the time lag values p 0 01 fig s7a b the general patterns of changes in the testate amoeba community were similar between shidou and bantou reservoirs however there were some minor differences in shidou reservoir the βmntd values increased from the time lag 0 to 44 months and exhibited a sharp decline when time lag 44 months in bantou reservoir the βmntd values increased from the time lag 0 to 26 months and exhibited a gradual decline during time lag 26 44 months and abrupt decrease after the 44th month fig s7 we further explored the relationship between βnti and successional times and obtained similar trends to βmntd in shidou and bantou reservoirs the βnti distributions gradually shifted over times lag most in stochastic community assembly βnti 2 fig s8 then we quantified the contributions of the deterministic e g homogeneous selection and variable selection and stochastic e g dispersal limitation homogenizing dispersal and ecological drift processes to the assembly of the testate amoeba community using βnti and rcbray values across different years the results showed that most βnti and rcbray values ranged from 2 to 2 and 0 95 to 0 95 respectively fig s9 this suggested that the community assembly of testate amoebae was primarily controlled by stochastic rather than deterministic processes in all seven years overall the stochastic processes dispersal limitation homogenizing dispersal and ecological drift accounted for 83 and 85 of the community assembly processes in shidou and bantou reservoirs over seven years respectively fig 5 there were some differences between different years and the deterministic processes were more influential in certain years e g 2013 and 2016 in shidou reservoir and 2016 in bantou reservoir fig 5 in shidou reservoir the stochastic processes mainly ecological drift had a relatively higher contribution in 2011 2012 2014 and 2015 however in 2010 2013 and 2016 the deterministic processes mainly homogeneous selection 33 58 and 61 for each of the three years respectively contributed relatively more fig 5 top in bantou reservoir the stochastic processes mainly ecological drift had a relatively higher contribution in 2011 2013 2014 and 2015 however in 2010 2012 and 2016 the deterministic processes mainly homogeneous selection 33 35 and 47 showed a high contribution to the community assembly fig 5 bottom moreover in order to assess if our results were biased by the inclusion of samples from different periods we chose different sampling periods to explore the variation of community assembly of testate amoebae the analyses further confirmed that the community assembly of testate amoebae was primarily controlled by stochastic rather than deterministic processes over two years 2013 2014 or four years 2013 2014 2015 2016 fig s10 as seen for the analysis over seven year period fig 5 4 discussion the temporal dynamic of testate amoeba communities in inland waters is not well described especially in freshwater reservoirs the use of deep high throughput sequencing now allows us to quickly and effectively obtain more biological information also of the relatively rare taxa in the plankton communities logares et al 2013 xue et al 2018 chen et al 2019 here we used this approach to explore the community changes of testate amoebae their driving factors and mechanisms of community assembly in two subtropical reservoirs over seven years 4 1 interannual and seasonal variability in testate amoeba communities in reservoirs in contrast to previous studies focusing only on testate amoebae based on the microscopic approach yang et al 2010 qin et al 2013a ju et al 2014 nasser et al 2019 here we first quantified the percentages of testate amoebae in the whole eukaryotic plankton and found that the majority of the testate amoebae belonged to rare low abundance taxa of the plankton communities the difference in community composition between the two reservoirs was not significant fig 2a fig s3 which is probably due to the high connectivity between the reservoirs previous long term studies were not able to detect repeated seasonal trends in the dynamics of phytoplankton or zooplankton communities from freshwater lakes anneville et al 2002 rettig et al 2006 similar results were obtained in our study since the interannual differences in the composition of testate amoeba communities were stronger than the seasonal repeated patterns table 1 this suggested that the influence of the unpredictable interannual variation in climate change and human activities on testate amoeba community might exceed their ability to recover from the seasonal variations in this study the variations of climate factors mainly included rainfall warming and cooling events and they varied among different years yang et al 2017 we further partitioned the beta diversity into species richness and species replacement components to quantify the key process driving the community dynamics of testate amoebae fig 3 interestingly the species richness contributed more variation than species turnover in driving the dynamics of testate amoeba community composition in contrast xue et al 2018 found that the species turnover explained a higher percentage of the eukaryotic plankton communities following a reservoir cyanobacterial bloom therefore variability in taxonomic group or level environmental gradients and temporal scale must be considered when investigating the key mechanisms of eukaryotic community dynamics moreover the recoverability can also be described as the resilience to an alternative stable state following an environmental change moustaka gouni et al 2006 resilience is often defined as the degree to which a system returns to pre disturbance conditions in state or function after a disturbance or perturbation konopka et al 2015 here we found that the testate amoeba community exhibited some recoverability over seven years which is similar to the findings of other studies of eukaryotic microbial communities in freshwater or marine ecosystems kim et al 2014 brannock et al 2016 liu et al 2019 4 2 minor influence of environmental variables on the testate amoeba community over seven years the water environmental conditions were relatively more stable in bantou than in shidou reservoirs fig s4 this may be due to the fact that shidou reservoir is located upstream of bantou reservoir and the former was subjected to more external disturbance yang et al 2017 the external disturbance perhaps refers to the water source of the reservoirs in shidou reservoir the water originates from several tributaries whereas the water in bantou reservoir mainly comes from shidou reservoir the difference of environmental factors between two reservoirs was minor but significant global r 0 059 p 0 01 generally the local testate amoeba community can respond differently to different environmental conditions qin et al 2013a regalado et al 2018 ndayishimiye et al 2019 although the difference of testate amoeba community composition was not significant between shidou and bantou reservoirs environmental factors influenced testate amoebae in different or complex ways in this study first the transparency water temperature ph dissolved oxygen electrical conductivity and total nitrogen were significant variables in shaping the testate amoeba community in shidou reservoir however water depth water temperature chlorophyll ɑ electrical conductivity total nitrogen and phosphate phosphorus were significant variables in bantou reservoir fig 4a b in addition the water temperature had slightly higher importance for the testate amoeba community in bantou than shidou reservoirs fig 4c d second many studies have shown that the physico chemical factors and nutrients have both direct and indirect effects on microeukaryotic and bacterial communities in aquatic ecosystems powell et al 2015 wang et al 2016 ren et al 2018 xue et al 2018 in our two reservoirs the testate amoeba communities were also impacted by both direct and indirect effects from the physico chemical factors and nutrients as indicated by the partial least squares model fig s5 nevertheless only up to 15 of the community variation could be explained by measured environmental variables in our vpa analysis this indicated that these environmental factors or deterministic processes played a minor role in community assembly of the testate amoebae over seven years recently stochastic processes shaped microeukaryotic community assembly was reported across wet and dry seasons in a subtropical river by chen et al 2019 in addition the large unexplained community variation in this study could also be due to the absence of some important environmental factors that were not taken into account in the vpa 4 3 the community assembly of testate amoebae driven by stochastic processes in general both deterministic and stochastic processes occur simultaneously in the assembly of local communities chase 2010 ofiteru et al 2010 xue et al 2018 chen et al 2019 it is a central goal in ecology to quantify the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes for the assembly of microbial communities morrison whittle and goddard 2015 zhou and ning 2017 our results clearly indicated that the stochastic processes are more important than deterministic processes for the assembly of the testate amoeba communities in the two subtropical reservoirs over seven years fig 5 hence in our study the environmental variables could only explain a minor part of the variation in the testate amoeba communities in this study the testate amoeba community showed a good fit to the neutral community model which explained over 65 of the frequency distribution of the testate amoeba taxa in the two reservoirs fig s6 this means that community assembly could be mainly shaped by stochastic processes this conclusion is supported by the results of xue et al 2018 which indicated that the stochastic processes are particularly pronounced for the rare eukaryotic plankton further in the stegen null model results the stochastic processes mainly ecological drift explained over 80 of the community variation in the seven year succession whereas the deterministic processes explained less than 20 community variation in the two reservoirs fig 5 combined with the assessment of the neutral model this result further corroborated the importance of stochastic processes for community assembly of testate amoebae the importance of stochastic processes was previously illustrated for other eukaryotic microbial communities from subtropical rivers and reservoirs ren et al 2018 chen et al 2019 in addition we found that the contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes to the community assembly fluctuated across different years for example the community assembly of testate amoebae was almost completely explained by stochastic processes for shidou reservoir in 2011 this may be due to the relocation of local residents in the upper reaches and the water quality improvement in 2010 yang et al 2017 total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and comprehensive trophic state index tsic showed a significant decrease after human population emigration in late 2010 yang et al 2017 the people emigration could have reduced the impact or stress of environmental factors on the testate amoeba community which in turn led to an increased contribution of the stochastic processes to the community assembly anthropogenic influence can cause disturbance of the water environment for example by increasing the nutrients and promoting cyanobacterial bloom such changes can strongly affect the community assembly of plankton communities liu et al 2019 in 2016 however the contribution of the deterministic processes mainly from the homogeneous selection of environmental factors to community assembly of testate amoebae increased significantly suggesting that the response of the community to environmental homogeneous selection was delayed perhaps due to the cyanobacterial bloom in 2015 fig 5 yang et al 2017 liu et al 2019 reservoir ecosystems are typically subject to disturbances of different frequencies and intensities natural communities are usually not in equilibrium and temporal snapshots can be heavily influenced by short term variations for example storm and flooding events lin and patel 2008 perdomo et al 2012 luo et al 2015 in order to assess if our results were biased by the inclusion of samples from different periods we performed a second null model analysis only including samples from two or four year periods fig s10 the results were almost identical to those of the full data set over all seven years and confirmed that the community assembly of testate amoebae was primarily controlled by stochastic rather than deterministic processes overall the stochastic processes were the main driving force or mechanism for community assembly of testate amoebae in the two subtropical reservoirs but relative contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes exhibited a high degree of fluctuation between individual years in addition our results may potentially challenge the accuracy of the traditional model or transfer functions employing testate amoeba communities as indicators for reconstruction of the past environment or climate based on a single sediment core sample to improve the accuracy of the model or transfer functions more community assembly processes and ecological factors should be taken into account therefore the increased understanding of the processes governing the community assembly of testate amoebae may have important implications for monitoring plankton diversity and protecting the water resources especially drinking water conservation management in the anthropocene 5 conclusions we highlighted the importance of stochastic processes in shaping the testate amoeba community from inland waters for the first time our study provides a better understanding of long term dynamic patterns processes and mechanisms underlying the testate amoeba community in two subtropical reservoirs we found that the majority of testate amoebae belonged to the rare eukaryotic plankton because they had a relative abundance 0 01 in the plankton community in both reservoirs the testate amoeba communities exhibited a stronger interannual variation than seasonal change and they first showed a directional change then a convergent change from 2010 to 2016 further species richness rather than species turnover accounted for the majority of community variation more than 85 of community variation could not be explained by our measured environmental variables over the seven year period stochastic processes appeared to play a more important role in the structuring of testate amoeba community however the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes varied greatly among the seven successional years altogether our results indicate that both stochastic and deterministic processes can influence the community assembly of testate amoebae but the stochastic processes e g ecological drift appear to be the dominant mechanism in this study therefore we should consider the importance of stochastic processes as well as the disturbance caused by climate change and human activities when designing studies

introduction organosiloxanes are composed of alternating silicon oxygen si o units with one or more organic groups attached to each silicon atom such as methyl phenyl ethylene trifluoropropyl etc these compounds are widely used in both industrial and consumer products as coatings defoamers thermal transfer fluids lubricants sealants and cosmetics etc brook et al 2009a b c the annual global sales of polyorganosiloxanes reached 2 12 million tones in 2013 gsc 2016 and 6 7 million tones in 2018 garside 2019 recently siloxanes especially cyclic dimethylsiloxanes including octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane d4 decamethylcyclopentasiloxane d5 and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane d6 have received increasing attention due to their presence in both environment matrices and biota dewil et al 2007 environment canada 2008a b c horii and kannan 2008 lu et al 2011 sehsc 2017 notably mclachlan et al 2014 did one pioneering research which suggested that besides dimethylsiloxanes some modified methylsiloxanes with portions of methyl groups replaced by other functional groups also could be released to environmental compartments after their usage for example polyphenylmethylsiloxanes and polytrifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes are organosiloxane polymers with some methyl groups respectively replaced by phenyl and trifluoropropyl groups compared with dimethylsiloxanes polyphenylmethylsiloxanes have better thermal stability ultraviolet aging and radiation resistance freire et al 1996 horta et al 2000 kawakami and li 2000 while polytrifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes have stronger thermal chemical and solvent resistance kuo et al 1997 madkour and mark 1995 thomas 1972 these two types of modified methylsiloxanes have been used in cosmetics electronic textile products and automotive fuel systems etc furukawa et al 2002 liu et al 2012 polmanteer 1988 saam 1999 xu et al 2018 zhi et al 2018 according to reports yuboinfo 2017 zjqx 2017 the annual global production volumes of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in year 2016 were approximately 302 300 and 43 600 tones respectively triphenyl trimethyl cyclotrisiloxane p3 and tetraphenyl tetramethyl cyclotetrasiloxane p4 are important intermediates in the synthesis of polyphenylmethylsiloxane while tris trifluoropropyl trimethyl cyclotrisiloxane d3f is a typical intermediate for preparation of polytrifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes during the ring opening polymerization of intermediates for preparing polysiloxanes grunlan et al 2003 both intermediates and other similar oligomers as byproducts e g tetrakis trifluoropropyl tetramethyl cyclotetrasiloxane d4f will remain in polymer mixtures fei et al 2014 kaehlig et al 2009 in residential areas p3 p4 d3f and d4f as impurities of polymers would enter domestic wastewater during the general use of cosmetics personal care and other household products containing polyphenylmethylsiloxane and polytrifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes banerjee 2015 xu et al 2018 and then be treated in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps therefore it was necessary to characterize emissions of these compounds in municipal wwtps on a large geographic scale especially in china which was the largest manufacturer 0 85 million tones in 2016 for organosiloxanes in the world lmcmr 2019 sagsi 2017 due to their high organic carbon sorption coefficients estimated log koc 8 06 for p3 10 11 for p4 6 72 for d3f and 8 76 for d4f xu et al 2018 zhi et al 2018 both phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in the wwtps would be strongly adsorbed by sludge although biodegradation of these modified siloxanes similar to dimethylsiloxanes wang et al 2013 may be poor during wastewater treatment processes their potential degradation mechanisms during sludge digestion with long hydraulic retention time hrt often more than ten days should be paid attention furthermore sludge could be transferred to the soil through land application of biosolids as both phenyl and trifluoropropyl groups had larger lipophilicity than ch3 ecological effects of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes may be different from those of the corresponding dimethylsiloxanes one hand phenylmethylsiloxanes in soil had stronger persistence than their corresponding dimethylsioxanes xu et al 2018 the other hand although has not been confirmed the speculation about stronger bioaccumulations of both phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes than dimethylsiloxanes may be reasonable because lipophilicities of chemical compounds often have positive correlations with their bioaccumulations in terrestrial organisms kenaga 1980 lord et al 1980 therefore it is also necessary to assess potential risk of these modified siloxanes to soil organism through sludge fertilization until now the related researches on emission degradation and risk of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes were scarce in the present study based on both municipal wastewater sludge samples from 29 wwtps across china and simulated degradation

results and discussion 3 1 profiles of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in wwtps 3 1 1 wastewater in summer and winter of 2018 influent and effluent wastewater samples n 116

concentration ranges were loq 68 0 ng g dw for cis p3 df 91 4 loq 188 ng g dw for trans p3 df 96 6 loq 25 5 ng g dw for cis p4 df 46 6 loq 65 7 ng g dw for trans p4a df 72 4 loq 29 5 ng g dw for trans p4b df 50 0 and loq 18 5 ng g dw for trans p4c df 19 0 respectively using the equations mentioned in section 2 5 mass load calculations indicated that removal of phenylmethylsiloxanes in wwtps mainly arose from adsorption onto sludge 86 99 mean 93 table s6 overall mean concentration of total p3 isomers p3 mean 85 5 ng g loq to 247 ng g dw were 3 4 times higher than those of total p4 isomers p4 mean 25 0 ng g loq to 136 ng g dw which was consistent with one previous literature xu et al 2018 reporting that in phenylmethylsiloxane containing personal care products mean concentrations of p3 were 1 5 5 8 times higher than those of p4 meanwhile strong linear correlations fig s1 were observed between p3 and p4 in samples collected in both summer r2 0 77 and winter seasons r2 0 62 indicating that the emission sources of p3 and p4 in these cities are basically identical in detail the mean concentration ratio of cis p3 to trans p3 in sludge samples was 1 2 9 which was basically consistent with their statistical ratios related to the orientation possibilities of phenyl groups i e cis p3 trans p3 1 3 jiang et al 2006 however the mean concentration ratio of cis p4 to trans p4a to trans p4b and to trans p4c 3 3 10 4 1 in sludge was different from their statistical ratios i e 1 4 2 1 jiang et al 2006 in fact the statistical ratios of the various isomers in p3 and p4 are only applicable to their pure equilibrium mixtures e g prepared there is no guarantee that this will be the case in the environmental samples with poorly defined origin and after poorly understood partitioning processes residual levels of trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in aqueous and solid phase of raw wastewater samples were lower than their loqs due to their high log koc 6 72 for d3f and 8 76 for d4f trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes from aqueous phase could strongly accumulate in the sludge during wastewater treatment especially during the water solid separation in secondary clarifier tanks where large fractions of organic carbons in wastewater have been removed and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes accumulation in sludge would be accelerated in consistent with the above speculation a small amount of trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes d3f trans d4fa and trans d4fb was detected in raw sludge samples with concentrations ranging from loq to 15 7 ng g dw mean 1 4 ng g dw df 20 7 for d3f while loq to 8 6 ng g dw mean 0 91 ng g dw df 19 0 for total d4f isomers d4f as shown in fig 1 and table s7 the correlations between d3f and d4f were not analyzed due to so few data points n 6 for each season 3 1 3 comparison with literatures at present there are few reports about phenylmethylsiloxane and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane in sludges only one previous study xu et al 2018 reported p3 and p4 isomers were detected 66 2 to 2 63 103 ng g in one wastewater treatment plant in laixi city of china another literature referred to trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in sludge from wastewater treatment plants located in stockholm mclachlan et al 2014 with concentrations in the range of 0 07 0 13 ng g for d3f and 0 13 0 60 ng g for d4f which were about 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than those found in the present study according to the information obtained from the wwtps in the present study the dominant source is domestic wastewater with no obvious industrial waste inputs generally the use and discharge of personal care products may be one of the important sources of phenylmethylsiloxane and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane in domestic sludge which was similar to dimethylsiloxanes horii and kannan 2008 xu et al 2013 however the mean concentrations of phenylmethylsiloxane p3 p4 and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane d3f d4f measured in the present study were about 4 orders of magnitude lower than those of dimethylsiloxane d4 d5 and d6 found in sludges from various countries such as china li et al 2016 xu et al 2013 canada wang et al 2015 korea lee et al 2014 greece bletsou et al 2013 and sweden kaj et al 2005 where d4 d5 and d6 concentrations ranged from loq 19 4 μg g dw 0 05 70 9 μg g dw and loq 11 1 μg g dw respectively table s8 the lower concentrations of phenylmethylsiloxane and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane cyclics in sludge samples may be attributed to the lower consumption of these non dimethylsiloxanes silicone materials relative to that of dimethylsiloxanes for example production volumes of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in china year 2016 were about 48 500 tones and 1570 tones respectively yuboinfo 2017 zjqx 2017 while the total production 1 02 million tones of dimethylsiloxanes in china in 2017 was about 20 times the production of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes together lmcmr 2019 3 2 geographical distributions and influencing factor analysis 3 2 1 emission distribution due to too low detection frequencies 20 7 for d3f and 19 0 for d4f of trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in raw sludge samples it was difficult to extract any spatial trends for these compounds therefore only phenylmethylsiloxane cyclics are the focus in this section based on sludge concentration mean value for summer and winter sludge volume and service population per capita daily sludge emissions of phenylmethylsiloxanes in various cities of china were calculated and the results showed obvious spatial differences 0 457 14 9 µg d across the country table s9 for instance emissions in shenzhen 14 9 μg d nanning 13 2 μg d and chongqing 10 5 μg d are up to 32 6 times higher than those in xining 0 736 μg d daqing 0 730 μg d shihezi 0 602 μg d and lanzhou 0 457 μg d in addition in any given location the summer emission was obviously higher 1 79 8 24 times than that in the winter 3 2 2 influencing factor analysis in the present study all the studied wwtps were equipped with biological treatment processes anaerobic anoxic oxic or anaerobic oxic table s1 however one previous literature reported that similar to dimethylsiloxanes phenylmethylsiloxanes were difficult to be biodegraded xu et al 2018 as discussed in section 3 1 sorption to sludge had the dominant contribution mean 93 to the phenylmethylsiloxanes removal from wastewater in all wwtps in other words wastewater treatment processes have little effect on their emission in sludge for any compounds released from consumer products difference in the consumption may be the important factor for the spatial and temporal trends of their emission unfortunately it was not possible to obtain the consumption volumes of phenylsiloxanes for the individual cities however the lumped consumption volumes were available in seven geographic regions of china where these sampling sites located i e south north east northeast central northwest and southwest fig s2 briefly the consumption of phenylmethylsiloxanes in china is highly uneven in year 2016 zjqx 2017 more than 50 of the country s phenylsilicone oil consumption was concentrated in the east 28 4 and south regions 25 9 the uneven consumption volumes could not be totally explained by population density per capita consumption volume of phenylsilicone oil followed the order south 53 4 g year north 28 7 g year east 24 6 g year northeast 22 4 g year central 20 2 g year northwest 13 3 g year southwest 11 7 g year table s10 as shown in table s10 and fig s3 per capita sludge emissions of phenylmethylsiloxanes were significantly correlated with the per capita consumption volume r2 0 806 for all regions except the southwest in southwest region although the per capita consumption of phenylmethylsiloxanes 11 7 g year was evidently lower than those in other six regions 13 3 53 4 g year the per capita emission 8 29 µg d is the second in the country next to south 12 1 µg d the exact reason for this deviation was not clear at this juncture similar to methylsiloxanes the primary source of phenylmethylsiloxanes in domestic wastewater might be attributed to the use of personal care products which in turn is positively correlated with per capita income iicl 2019 in fact phenylmethylsiloxanes emission in sludge did have a correlation with regional per capita gdp p 0 05 as shown in fig 2 but correlation is very weak and could only account for 20 of the variation of the emission r2 0 204 as shown in fig 2 the sludge emission of phenylmethylsiloxanes had a strong correlation with the annual average air temperature of the studied cities r2 0 633 p 0 01 because of their radiation resistant performance higher than dimethylsiloxanes freire et al 1996 horta et al 2000 kawakami and li 2000 saam 1999 phenylmethylsiloxanes are mainly used in high end sunscreens generally the use of personal care products and cosmetics such as shampoos hair care shower gels etc should be higher in higher temperature seasons and or locations this explanation was also consistent with the fact that the per capita emissions of phenylmethylsiloxanes in all of studied cities in summer were about 1 79 8 24 times higher than those from the same locations in winter fig 3 in addition there should be other factors affecting the spatial and seasonal emission of phenylmethylsiloxanes in wwtps for examples consumption habits and age structure of local population would affect consumption volumes of personal care products and cosmetics personal cleaning habits and treatment proportions of municipal wastewater could affect migration of phenylmethylsiloxanes from consumer products to wwtps although there was lack of related information at this juncture further researches should be expanded 3 3 degradation of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in sludge digestion processes in some n 9 of the studied wwtps raw sludges underwent anaerobic digestion hrt 16 25 d before their emission table s1 based on their mass fluxes in both raw sludge and paired digested sludge samples the calculated with eq 3 4 and 6 removal efficiencies after sludge digestion processes were 9 3 25 5 19 1 at mean for cis p3 16 6 25 8 23 0 at mean for trans p3 3 0 17 9 9 5 at mean for cis p4 7 7 20 9 15 0 at mean for trans p4a 5 3 25 9 12 2 at mean for trans p4b 4 8 11 8 8 3 at mean for trans p4c 12 7 23 5 16 8 at mean for d3f 2 6 5 3 4 0 at mean for trans d4fa and 11 3 12 6 12 0 at mean for trans d4fb respectively as volatilization of these compounds from sludge would be too slow to have contribution to their removal the speculation about their degradation during sludge digestion may be reasonable this speculation was further proved by the phenomenon that monomer phenylmethylsilanediol 2 8 23 1 ng g dw df 66 7 and trifluoropropylmethylsilanediol 2 5 ng g dw df 5 6 were detected in digested sludge but not paired raw sludge samples through simulated experiments mentioned in section 2 6 degradation pathways of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes during sludge digestion were studied during the whole experiments these compounds were not detected in gas phases of both sterile and activated systems suggesting their poor volatilization from sludge in contrast to their unremarkable degradation 1 6 3 6 in sterile sludge both phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes were much faster eliminated 38 57 in activated sludge after incubation for 40 d more specifically their degradation half lives were 33 7 d for cis p3 37 0 d for trans p3 42 3 d for cis p4 44 1 d for trans p4a 46 2 d for trans p4b 41 1 d for trans p4c 41 1 d for d3f 57 7 d for cis d4f 54 5 d for trans d4fa 53 6 d for trans d4fb and 52 6 d for trans d4fc respectively fig 4 the above data showed apparent biodegradation of siloxanes during sludge digestion based on masses of both siloxanes and degraded products in systems obtained by multiplying their concentrations in solids water with solids water volumes table s11 and s12 it was estimated that in activated system about 8 9 10 1 calculated as silicon mass of degraded phenylmethylsiloxanes were transformed to phenylmethylsilanediol during the whole experiments while 4 9 9 4 of degraded trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes were transformed to trifluoropropylmethylsilanediol the detection of monomer diols suggested one potential degradation mechanism of these compounds multistep cleavage hydrolysis process of si o chains to form oligomeric diols in addition besides silanediols it was found that 4 5 4 7 of degraded phenylmethylsiloxanes and 3 4 4 9 of degraded trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes were transformed to methylsilanetriol mesi oh 3 after incubation for 40 days one previous study has clarified si ph cleavage abiotic hydrolysis of phenylmethylsiloxanes in soils xu et al 2018 however si trifluoropropyl cleavage of trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes has not been reported until now one literature merely found si o cleavage of these compounds during their abiotic hydrolysis experiments in water samples zhi et al 2018 during hydrolysis process catalyzed by activated sludge the cleavage of branched groups from si o backbones may elevate bioavailability of these modified siloxanes for further biodegradation it should be noted that different from those in digested sludge neither phenylmethylsilanediol nor trifluoropropylmethylsilanediol was found in any raw sludge from the studied wwtps suggesting that consistent with dimethylsiloxanes reported in previous literatures brook et al 2009a b c phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes were hardly biodegraded during wastewater biological treatment processes in view of their long biodegradation half lives it could be speculated that negligible biotic degradation of these compounds during wastewater biological treatment should arise from the short hrt 14 22 h table s1 3 4 ecological risk assessment of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropyl methylsiloxanes in sludge amended soil the monitoring data discussed above indicated that emission to water is negligibly low since no phenylmethylsiloxane and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane could be detected in any effluent samples therefore the risk assessment in the following focused on these compounds in soil compartment only currently there are about 4436 municipal wastewater treatment plants in china with the annual sludge production volume of about 35 million tones fu et al 2017 overall 15 of sludge did not undergo treatment while the rest is treated through landfilling 50 incineration 10 producing building materials 9 and land application 16 therefore phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes may enter the soil compartment through soil amendment by sludge hazard quotient hq values of p3 p4 d3f and d4f in soils undergoing one year sludge applications was calculated with eq 7 the pnecsoil µg kg and pecsoil µg kg values of p3 p4 d3f and d4f are summarized in table s13 and the estimated hazard quotients of these contaminants are illustrated in fig 5 in general hq 1 0 means that risk cannot be ruled out and should be further analyzed hq 1 0 represents that the risk was assumed not to be of concern sanchez bayo et al 2002 overall hq values were 0 003 for p3 and p4 and 0 0003 for d3f and d4f indicating low ecological risks in soils when sludge is annually applied notably the above assessment has several limitations that need further deliberation first the pecsoil values were calculated based on the measured concentrations in sludge and sludge application rates not frequencies without consideration of any removal or accumulation of these compounds from soil after sludge application xu et al 2018 reported that soil samples from a commercial forest in china with sludge application three times a year were tested several times a year and the results showed that p3 and p4 did not accumulate during year 2015 2017 therefore potential of year over year accumulation of phenylmethylsiloxanes in soil was small especially at application frequency of once or twice per year and not likely to raise the hq values to the level of concern however xu et al 2018 also reported that the half lives of p3 and p4 up to 55 7d in soil was significantly longer 10 times than their corresponding dimethylsiloxane cyclics and therefore 94 elimination of p3 and p4 in the soil after one sludge application needs about 223 days or less i e 4 half lives in other words it may be speculated that if the sludge application were multiple times per year input rates of p3 and p4 in soil may be obviously faster than their degradation rates and then these compounds may accumulate in the soil the same argument is applicable to the trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes second all pnecsoil were predicted values because there are no measured ecotoxicity data for these compounds representing the biggest uncertainty for this risk assessment the confirmed soil emission especially for phenylmethylsiloxanes suggests the real need of the measured ecotoxicity data for soil dwelling organisms 4 conclusions this is the first nationwide survey to determine phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in sludge from wwtps in china the results showed that environmental emission was sparse for trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes but ubiquitous for phenylmethylsiloxanes overall the data from two sampling events in these 25 chinese cities suggested that consumption gdp and air temperature had positive influence on emission of phenylmethylsiloxanes to municipal wastewater phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in wastewater mainly accumulated in sludge and could be hydrolyzed during sludge digestion although the calculated risk quotients in soil were less than 0 01 based on single sludge fertilization their ecological effect should be further studied in view of their potential soil accumulation especially when the accelerated frequencies of sludge fertilization lead to input rates of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in soil faster than their elimination rates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

introduction organosiloxanes are composed of alternating silicon oxygen si o units with one or more organic groups attached to each silicon atom such as methyl phenyl ethylene trifluoropropyl etc these compounds are widely used in both industrial and consumer products as coatings defoamers thermal transfer fluids lubricants sealants and cosmetics etc brook et al 2009a b c the annual global sales of polyorganosiloxanes reached 2 12 million tones in 2013 gsc 2016 and 6 7 million tones in 2018 garside 2019 recently siloxanes especially cyclic dimethylsiloxanes including octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane d4 decamethylcyclopentasiloxane d5 and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane d6 have received increasing attention due to their presence in both environment matrices and biota dewil et al 2007 environment canada 2008a b c horii and kannan 2008 lu et al 2011 sehsc 2017 notably mclachlan et al 2014 did one pioneering research which suggested that besides dimethylsiloxanes some modified methylsiloxanes with portions of methyl groups replaced by other functional groups also could be released to environmental compartments after their usage for example polyphenylmethylsiloxanes and polytrifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes are organosiloxane polymers with some methyl groups respectively replaced by phenyl and trifluoropropyl groups compared with dimethylsiloxanes polyphenylmethylsiloxanes have better thermal stability ultraviolet aging and radiation resistance freire et al 1996 horta et al 2000 kawakami and li 2000 while polytrifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes have stronger thermal chemical and solvent resistance kuo et al 1997 madkour and mark 1995 thomas 1972 these two types of modified methylsiloxanes have been used in cosmetics electronic textile products and automotive fuel systems etc furukawa et al 2002 liu et al 2012 polmanteer 1988 saam 1999 xu et al 2018 zhi et al 2018 according to reports yuboinfo 2017 zjqx 2017 the annual global production volumes of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in year 2016 were approximately 302 300 and 43 600 tones respectively triphenyl trimethyl cyclotrisiloxane p3 and tetraphenyl tetramethyl cyclotetrasiloxane p4 are important intermediates in the synthesis of polyphenylmethylsiloxane while tris trifluoropropyl trimethyl cyclotrisiloxane d3f is a typical intermediate for preparation of polytrifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes during the ring opening polymerization of intermediates for preparing polysiloxanes grunlan et al 2003 both intermediates and other similar oligomers as byproducts e g tetrakis trifluoropropyl tetramethyl cyclotetrasiloxane d4f will remain in polymer mixtures fei et al 2014 kaehlig et al 2009 in residential areas p3 p4 d3f and d4f as impurities of polymers would enter domestic wastewater during the general use of cosmetics personal care and other household products containing polyphenylmethylsiloxane and polytrifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes banerjee 2015 xu et al 2018 and then be treated in municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps therefore it was necessary to characterize emissions of these compounds in municipal wwtps on a large geographic scale especially in china which was the largest manufacturer 0 85 million tones in 2016 for organosiloxanes in the world lmcmr 2019 sagsi 2017 due to their high organic carbon sorption coefficients estimated log koc 8 06 for p3 10 11 for p4 6 72 for d3f and 8 76 for d4f xu et al 2018 zhi et al 2018 both phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in the wwtps would be strongly adsorbed by sludge although biodegradation of these modified siloxanes similar to dimethylsiloxanes wang et al 2013 may be poor during wastewater treatment processes their potential degradation mechanisms during sludge digestion with long hydraulic retention time hrt often more than ten days should be paid attention furthermore sludge could be transferred to the soil through land application of biosolids as both phenyl and trifluoropropyl groups had larger lipophilicity than ch3 ecological effects of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes may be different from those of the corresponding dimethylsiloxanes one hand phenylmethylsiloxanes in soil had stronger persistence than their corresponding dimethylsioxanes xu et al 2018 the other hand although has not been confirmed the speculation about stronger bioaccumulations of both phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes than dimethylsiloxanes may be reasonable because lipophilicities of chemical compounds often have positive correlations with their bioaccumulations in terrestrial organisms kenaga 1980 lord et al 1980 therefore it is also necessary to assess potential risk of these modified siloxanes to soil organism through sludge fertilization until now the related researches on emission degradation and risk of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes were scarce in the present study based on both municipal wastewater sludge samples from 29 wwtps across china and simulated degradation experiments the main objectives were 1 to examine national distribution of p3 p4 d3f and d4f in chinese municipal wwtps 2 to identify the factors affecting regional differences in their environmental

anaerobic sludge digestion experiment hexane solution of p3 p4 d3f and d4f 40 µl of 100 mg l were separately mixed with 400 ml of activated sludge 50 g l of solids toc 35 ph 6 8 7 2 and then added into one glass bottle 500 ml after being flushed for 5 min with n2 co2 80 20 to create anaerobic condition the bottle was sealed with a teflon septum through one teflon tube the headspace of the bottle was connected with another glass vial containing 40 ml of acetone solvent to adsorb siloxanes volatilizing from culture the culture was incubated at 35 c while being shaken at 200 rpm fifteen bottles were prepared for each compound at each of the following time points 0 4 8 20 and 40 d three bottles were sterilized by 1 nan3 precipitated for 12 h and then taken to determine concentrations of parent siloxanes and their degradation products including phenylmethylsilanediol trifluoropropylmethylsilanediol and methylsilanetriol in both sludge and acetone solvent the analysis methods for target degradation products were provided in supplementary material total organic carbon toc of sludge eliminated about 54 60 after incubation for 40 d was also measured to indicate anaerobic reaction activity in addition as the control group glass bottles containing sterile sludge sterilized by 1 nan3 were prepared under the same conditions 2 7 assessment of potential ecological risk the risk of

results and discussion 3 1 profiles of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in wwtps 3 1 1 wastewater in summer and winter of 2018 influent and effluent wastewater samples n 116 were collected from 29 municipal wwtps located in 25 cities of china the concentration ranges of six phenylmethylsiloxane isomers in aqueous phase of influent samples n 58 were loq 6 9 ng l for cis p3 df 91 4 loq 13 5 ng l for trans p3 df 96 6 loq 0 91 ng l for cis p4 df 20 7 loq 2 1 ng l for trans p4a df 46 6 loq 0 84 ng l for trans p4b df 13 8 and loq 0 51 ng l for trans p4c df 1 72 respectively table s4 the concentration ranges of six phenylmethylsiloxane isomers in solid phase of influent samples were loq 59 3 ng g dw for cis p3 df 91 4 loq 165 ng g dw for trans p3 df 96 6 loq 28 4 ng g dw for cis p4 df 46 6 loq 67 7 ng g dw for trans p4a df 72 4 loq 31 9 ng g dw for trans p4b df 55 2 and loq 26 3 ng g dw for trans p4c df 22 4 respectively table s4 however no phenylmethylsiloxanes were detected in any effluent samples of these studied wwtps overall trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes were not found in any wastewater samples neither in the liquid phase nor in the solid phase 3 1 2 raw sludge due to lack of literatures log koc kaw values of p3 11 3 p4 14 4 d3f 8 02 and d4f 8 36 were roughly calculated by epi suite which indicated their strongly sorption in sludge and poor volatilization to air phase in the present study all stereoisomers of phenylmethylsiloxanes were detected in raw sludge samples loq 188 ng g dw df 19 0 96 6 n 58 as shown in fig 1 and table s5 the concentration ranges were loq 68 0 ng g dw for cis p3 df 91 4 loq 188 ng g dw for trans p3 df 96 6 loq 25 5 ng g dw for cis p4 df 46 6 loq 65 7 ng g dw for trans p4a df 72 4 loq 29 5 ng g dw for trans p4b df 50 0 and loq 18 5 ng g dw for trans p4c df 19 0 respectively using the equations mentioned in section 2 5 mass load calculations indicated that removal of phenylmethylsiloxanes in wwtps mainly arose from adsorption onto sludge 86 99 mean 93 table s6 overall mean concentration of total p3 isomers p3 mean 85 5 ng g loq to 247 ng g dw were 3 4 times higher than those of total p4 isomers p4 mean 25 0 ng g loq to 136 ng g dw which was consistent with one previous literature xu et al 2018 reporting that in phenylmethylsiloxane containing personal care products mean concentrations of p3 were 1 5 5 8 times higher than those of p4 meanwhile strong linear correlations fig s1 were observed between p3 and p4 in samples collected in both summer r2 0 77 and winter seasons r2 0 62 indicating that the emission sources of p3 and p4 in these cities are basically identical in detail the mean concentration ratio of cis p3 to trans p3 in sludge samples was 1 2 9 which was basically consistent with their statistical ratios related to the orientation possibilities of phenyl groups i e cis p3 trans p3 1 3 jiang et al 2006 however the mean concentration ratio of cis p4 to trans p4a to trans p4b and to trans p4c 3 3 10 4 1 in sludge was different from their statistical ratios i e 1 4 2 1 jiang et al 2006 in fact the statistical ratios of the various isomers in p3 and p4 are only applicable to their pure equilibrium mixtures e g prepared there is no guarantee that this will be the case in the environmental samples with poorly defined origin and after poorly understood partitioning processes residual levels of trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in aqueous and solid phase of raw wastewater samples were lower than their loqs due to their high log koc 6 72 for d3f and 8 76 for d4f trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes from aqueous phase could strongly accumulate in the sludge during wastewater treatment especially during the water solid separation in secondary clarifier tanks where large fractions of organic carbons in wastewater have been removed and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes accumulation in sludge would be accelerated in consistent with the above speculation a small amount of trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes d3f trans d4fa and trans d4fb was detected in raw sludge samples with concentrations ranging from loq to 15 7 ng g dw mean 1 4 ng g dw df 20 7 for d3f while loq to 8 6 ng g dw mean 0 91 ng g dw df 19 0 for total d4f isomers d4f as shown in fig 1 and table s7 the correlations between d3f and d4f were not analyzed due to so few data points n 6 for each season 3 1 3 comparison with literatures at present there are few reports about phenylmethylsiloxane and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane in sludges only one previous study xu et al 2018 reported p3 and p4 isomers were detected 66 2 to 2 63 103 ng g in one wastewater treatment plant in laixi city of china another literature referred to trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in sludge from wastewater treatment plants located in stockholm mclachlan et al 2014 with concentrations in the range of 0 07 0 13 ng g for d3f and 0 13 0 60 ng g for d4f which were about 1 2 orders of magnitude lower than those found in the present study according to the information obtained from the wwtps in the present study the dominant source is domestic wastewater with no obvious industrial waste inputs generally the use and discharge of personal care products may be one of the important sources of phenylmethylsiloxane and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane in domestic sludge which was similar to dimethylsiloxanes horii and kannan 2008 xu et al 2013 however the mean concentrations of phenylmethylsiloxane p3 p4 and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane d3f d4f measured in the present study were about 4 orders of magnitude lower than those of dimethylsiloxane d4 d5 and d6 found in sludges from various countries such as china li et al 2016 xu et al 2013 canada wang et al 2015 korea lee et al 2014 greece bletsou et al 2013 and sweden kaj et al 2005 where d4 d5 and d6 concentrations ranged from loq 19 4 μg g dw 0 05 70 9 μg g dw and loq 11 1 μg g dw respectively table s8 the lower concentrations of phenylmethylsiloxane and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane cyclics in sludge samples may be attributed to the lower consumption of these non dimethylsiloxanes silicone materials relative to that of dimethylsiloxanes for example production volumes of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in china year 2016 were about 48 500 tones and 1570 tones respectively yuboinfo 2017 zjqx 2017 while the total production 1 02 million tones of dimethylsiloxanes in china in 2017 was about 20 times the production of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes together lmcmr 2019 3 2 geographical distributions and influencing factor analysis 3 2 1 emission distribution due to too low detection frequencies 20 7 for d3f and 19 0 for d4f of trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in raw sludge samples it was difficult to extract any spatial trends for these compounds therefore only phenylmethylsiloxane cyclics are the focus in this section based on sludge concentration mean value for summer and winter sludge volume and service population per capita daily sludge emissions of phenylmethylsiloxanes in various cities of china were calculated and the results showed obvious spatial differences 0 457 14 9 µg d across the country table s9 for instance emissions in shenzhen 14 9 μg d nanning 13 2 μg d and chongqing 10 5 μg d are up to 32 6 times higher than those in xining 0 736 μg d daqing 0 730 μg d shihezi 0 602 μg d and lanzhou 0 457 μg d in addition in any given location the summer emission was obviously higher 1 79 8 24 times than that in the winter 3 2 2 influencing factor analysis in the present study all the studied wwtps were equipped with biological treatment processes anaerobic anoxic oxic or anaerobic oxic table s1 however one previous literature reported that similar to dimethylsiloxanes phenylmethylsiloxanes were difficult to be biodegraded xu et al 2018 as discussed in section 3 1 sorption to sludge had the dominant contribution mean 93 to the phenylmethylsiloxanes removal from wastewater in all wwtps in other words wastewater treatment processes have little effect on their emission in sludge for any compounds released from consumer products difference in the consumption may be the important factor for the spatial and temporal trends of their emission unfortunately it was not possible to obtain the consumption volumes of phenylsiloxanes for the individual cities however the lumped consumption volumes were available in seven geographic regions of china where these sampling sites located i e south north east northeast central northwest and southwest fig s2 briefly the consumption of phenylmethylsiloxanes in china is highly uneven in year 2016 zjqx 2017 more than 50 of the country s phenylsilicone oil consumption was concentrated in the east 28 4 and south regions 25 9 the uneven consumption volumes could not be totally explained by population density per capita consumption volume of phenylsilicone oil followed the order south 53 4 g year north 28 7 g year east 24 6 g year northeast 22 4 g year central 20 2 g year northwest 13 3 g year southwest 11 7 g year table s10 as shown in table s10 and fig s3 per capita sludge emissions of phenylmethylsiloxanes were significantly correlated with the per capita consumption volume r2 0 806 for all regions except the southwest in southwest region although the per capita consumption of phenylmethylsiloxanes 11 7 g year was evidently lower than those in other six regions 13 3 53 4 g year the per capita emission 8 29 µg d is the second in the country next to south 12 1 µg d the exact reason for this deviation was not clear at this juncture similar to methylsiloxanes the primary source of phenylmethylsiloxanes in domestic wastewater might be attributed to the use of personal care products which in turn is positively correlated with per capita income iicl 2019 in fact phenylmethylsiloxanes emission in sludge did have a correlation with regional per capita gdp p 0 05 as shown in fig 2 but correlation is very weak and could only account for 20 of the variation of the emission r2 0 204 as shown in fig 2 the sludge emission of phenylmethylsiloxanes had a strong correlation with the annual average air temperature of the studied cities r2 0 633 p 0 01 because of their radiation resistant performance higher than dimethylsiloxanes freire et al 1996 horta et al 2000 kawakami and li 2000 saam 1999 phenylmethylsiloxanes are mainly used in high end sunscreens generally the use of personal care products and cosmetics such as shampoos hair care shower gels etc should be higher in higher temperature seasons and or locations this explanation was also consistent with the fact that the per capita emissions of phenylmethylsiloxanes in all of studied cities in summer were about 1 79 8 24 times higher than those from the same locations in winter fig 3 in addition there should be other factors affecting the spatial and seasonal emission of phenylmethylsiloxanes in wwtps for examples consumption habits and age structure of local population would affect consumption volumes of personal care products and cosmetics personal cleaning habits and treatment proportions of municipal wastewater could affect migration of phenylmethylsiloxanes from consumer products to wwtps although there was lack of related information at this juncture further researches should be expanded 3 3 degradation of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in sludge digestion processes in some n 9 of the studied wwtps raw sludges underwent anaerobic digestion hrt 16 25 d before their emission table s1 based on their mass fluxes in both raw sludge and paired digested sludge samples the calculated with eq 3 4 and 6 removal efficiencies after sludge digestion processes were 9 3 25 5 19 1 at mean for cis p3 16 6 25 8 23 0 at mean for trans p3 3 0 17 9 9 5 at mean for cis p4 7 7 20 9 15 0 at mean for trans p4a 5 3 25 9 12 2 at mean for trans p4b 4 8 11 8 8 3 at mean for trans p4c 12 7 23 5 16 8 at mean for d3f 2 6 5 3 4 0 at mean for trans d4fa and 11 3 12 6 12 0 at mean for trans d4fb respectively as volatilization of these compounds from sludge would be too slow to have contribution to their removal the speculation about their degradation during sludge digestion may be reasonable this speculation was further proved by the phenomenon that monomer phenylmethylsilanediol 2 8 23 1 ng g dw df 66 7 and trifluoropropylmethylsilanediol 2 5 ng g dw df 5 6 were detected in digested sludge but not paired raw sludge samples through simulated experiments mentioned in section 2 6 degradation pathways of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes during sludge digestion were studied during the whole experiments these compounds were not detected in gas phases of both sterile and activated systems suggesting their poor volatilization from sludge in contrast to their unremarkable degradation 1 6 3 6 in sterile sludge both phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes were much faster eliminated 38 57 in activated sludge after incubation for 40 d more specifically their degradation half lives were 33 7 d for cis p3 37 0 d for trans p3 42 3 d for cis p4 44 1 d for trans p4a 46 2 d for trans p4b 41 1 d for trans p4c 41 1 d for d3f 57 7 d for cis d4f 54 5 d for trans d4fa 53 6 d for trans d4fb and 52 6 d for trans d4fc respectively fig 4 the above data showed apparent biodegradation of siloxanes during sludge digestion based on masses of both siloxanes and degraded products in systems obtained by multiplying their concentrations in solids water with solids water volumes table s11 and s12 it was estimated that in activated system about 8 9 10 1 calculated as silicon mass of degraded phenylmethylsiloxanes were transformed to phenylmethylsilanediol during the whole experiments while 4 9 9 4 of degraded trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes were transformed to trifluoropropylmethylsilanediol the detection of monomer diols suggested one potential degradation mechanism of these compounds multistep cleavage hydrolysis process of si o chains to form oligomeric diols in addition besides silanediols it was found that 4 5 4 7 of degraded phenylmethylsiloxanes and 3 4 4 9 of degraded trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes were transformed to methylsilanetriol mesi oh 3 after incubation for 40 days one previous study has clarified si ph cleavage abiotic hydrolysis of phenylmethylsiloxanes in soils xu et al 2018 however si trifluoropropyl cleavage of trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes has not been reported until now one literature merely found si o cleavage of these compounds during their abiotic hydrolysis experiments in water samples zhi et al 2018 during hydrolysis process catalyzed by activated sludge the cleavage of branched groups from si o backbones may elevate bioavailability of these modified siloxanes for further biodegradation it should be noted that different from those in digested sludge neither phenylmethylsilanediol nor trifluoropropylmethylsilanediol was found in any raw sludge from the studied wwtps suggesting that consistent with dimethylsiloxanes reported in previous literatures brook et al 2009a b c phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes were hardly biodegraded during wastewater biological treatment processes in view of their long biodegradation half lives it could be speculated that negligible biotic degradation of these compounds during wastewater biological treatment should arise from the short hrt 14 22 h table s1 3 4 ecological risk assessment of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropyl methylsiloxanes in sludge amended soil the monitoring data discussed above indicated that emission to water is negligibly low since no phenylmethylsiloxane and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxane could be detected in any effluent samples therefore the risk assessment in the following focused on these compounds in soil compartment only currently there are about 4436 municipal wastewater treatment plants in china with the annual sludge production volume of about 35 million tones fu et al 2017 overall 15 of sludge did not undergo treatment while the rest is treated through landfilling 50 incineration 10 producing building materials 9 and land application 16 therefore phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes may enter the soil compartment through soil amendment by sludge hazard quotient hq values of p3 p4 d3f and d4f in soils undergoing one year sludge applications was calculated with eq 7 the pnecsoil µg kg and pecsoil µg kg values of p3 p4 d3f and d4f are summarized in table s13 and the estimated hazard quotients of these contaminants are illustrated in fig 5 in general hq 1 0 means that risk cannot be ruled out and should be further analyzed hq 1 0 represents that the risk was assumed not to be of concern sanchez bayo et al 2002 overall hq values were 0 003 for p3 and p4 and 0 0003 for d3f and d4f indicating low ecological risks in soils when sludge is annually applied notably the above assessment has several limitations that need further deliberation first the pecsoil values were calculated based on the measured concentrations in sludge and sludge application rates not frequencies without consideration of any removal or accumulation of these compounds from soil after sludge application xu et al 2018 reported that soil samples from a commercial forest in china with sludge application three times a year were tested several times a year and the results showed that p3 and p4 did not accumulate during year 2015 2017 therefore potential of year over year accumulation of phenylmethylsiloxanes in soil was small especially at application frequency of once or twice per year and not likely to raise the hq values to the level of concern however xu et al 2018 also reported that the half lives of p3 and p4 up to 55 7d in soil was significantly longer 10 times than their corresponding dimethylsiloxane cyclics and therefore 94 elimination of p3 and p4 in the soil after one sludge application needs about 223 days or less i e 4 half lives in other words it may be speculated that if the sludge application were multiple times per year input rates of p3 and p4 in soil may be obviously faster than their degradation rates and then these compounds may accumulate in the soil the same argument is applicable to the trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes second all pnecsoil were predicted values because there are no measured ecotoxicity data for these compounds representing the biggest uncertainty for this risk assessment the confirmed soil emission especially for phenylmethylsiloxanes suggests the real need of the measured ecotoxicity data for soil dwelling organisms 4 conclusions this is the first nationwide survey to determine phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in sludge from wwtps in china the results showed that environmental emission was sparse for trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes but ubiquitous for phenylmethylsiloxanes overall the data from two sampling events in these 25 chinese cities suggested that consumption gdp and air temperature had positive influence on emission of phenylmethylsiloxanes to municipal wastewater phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in wastewater mainly accumulated in sludge and could be hydrolyzed during sludge digestion although the calculated risk quotients in soil were less than 0 01 based on single sludge fertilization their ecological effect should be further studied in view of their potential soil accumulation especially when the accelerated frequencies of sludge fertilization lead to input rates of phenylmethylsiloxanes and trifluoropropylmethylsiloxanes in soil faster than their elimination rates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17604,recently an increasing number of pharmaceutical compounds has become fluorinated owing to their pharmacological efficacy the use of these fluorinated pharmaceuticals continues to grow and they constitute 20 of the drugs on the current market however only a few studies have investigated the fate and transformation of these emerging contaminants in natural and engineered aquatic environments in the present study the h2 based reductive transformation of three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds levofloxacin sitagliptin and fluoxetine were investigated using alumina supported monometallic and bimetallic catalysts of the pt group noble metals i e ru rh pd and pt under ambient temperature and pressure conditions degradation of all three compounds was observed with catalytic reactivity ranging from 4 0 10 3 to 2 14 102 l min gcat in which fluoxetine generally showed the highest reactivity followed by sitagliptin and levofloxacin the fluorination yields and transformation products were characterized for each fluorinated compound and three different degradation mechanisms were elucidated 1 hydrodefluorination of c f bond to ch bond 2 hydrogenation of aromatic ring and 3 reductive cleavage of co bond from phenyl ether toxicity assessment using aliivibrio fischeri showed there were no significant changes in toxicity over levofloxacin and sitagliptin degradation suggesting the formation of no highly toxic by products during catalytic reduction for fluoxetine an increased toxicity was observed during its degradation while ecosar predicted toxicity values of all identified intermediates were lower than that of fluoxetine suggesting the formation of unidentified secondary by products that contribute to the overall toxicity the study showed that catalytic reduction is a promising remediation process for treating and defluorinating the fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fluorinated pharmaceuticals emerging contaminants catalytic degradation reductive treatment defluorination water treatment 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products are contaminants of emerging concern and their fate and transformation in engineered and natural systems have been studied extensively yang et al 2012 in the pharmaceutical industry significant attention has been paid to the synthesis and development of f containing pharmaceuticals over the last two decades murphy 2016 piccionello et al 2019 the high electronegativity and stability of c f bonds enable fluorinated pharmaceuticals to have significantly improved lipophilicity and metabolic stability compared with those of non fluorinated analogues thereby enhancing their pharmacological effects in the human body trojanowicz et al 2018 owing to their advantages pharmaceuticals containing fluorinated aromatic rings or trifluoromethyl substituents have been continuously growing in use and now over 20 of the drugs on the current market are fluorinated mei et al 2019 wang et al 2014 while fluorinated pharmaceuticals are rapidly increasing in dominance in the pharmaceutical market only limited studies to date are available for elucidating their fate and ecological impact on the environment the emerging occurrence of fluorinated pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments at levels of ng l to μg l was recently reported salazar et al 2017 for instance fluoxetine also known as prozac table 1 is a fluorinated antidepressant widely detected in multiple countries across the world in the concentration range 0 4 3645 ng l in wastewater influents silva et al 2012 levofloxacin a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and sitagliptin a new oral anti diabetic agent for type ii diabetes were also frequently detected in surface water and effluents from municipal and hospital wastewater treatment in the range of 62 4 186 ng l for levofloxacin and 35 117 ng l for sitagliptin abo haded et al 2017 balakrishna et al 2017 kim et al 2009 martín et al 2012 levofloxacin was reported to adversely affect aquatic organisms and cause bacterial resistance in the environment while sitagliptin showed carcinogenic potential in animals and cytotoxicity and genotoxicity for human lymphocytes doorslaer et al 2014 yuzbasioglu et al 2018 conventional physicochemical and biological processes in water and wastewater treatment plants showed poor removal of fluoxetine and levofloxacin epold et al 2015 hamdi et al 2013 kwon and armbrust 2006 radjenovic et al 2007 yang et al 2017 chemical treatments such as advanced oxidation processes for instance ultraviolet tio2 processes fenton and photo fenton reactions ozonation sonolysis and photo based treatments have been investigated for a few fluorinated compounds such as fluoxetine ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin chen et al 2020 lima et al 2017 méndez arriaga et al 2011 salazar et al 2017 tay and madehi 2015 zhao et al 2017 although these oxidative treatment processes efficiently degrade the parent fluorinated compounds only partial mineralization was observed resulting in the formation of by products including fluorinated species chen et al 2020 zhao et al 2017 these fluorinated intermediates are likely to be highly stable and recalcitrant in the environment owing to the c f bond and can be converted into more toxic metabolites by biotic and abiotic processes murphy 2016 for instance bel et al 2009 reported that the oxidative treatment of ciprofloxacin via sonolysis led to increased toxicity for green algae suggesting the formation of a more toxic f containing degradation product bel et al 2009 reductive treatments of fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds are much less explored angelo et al 2014 found that zerovalent iron can reduce ciprofloxacin via a partial defluorination pathway the applicability of the pt group noble metals i e ru rh pd and pt as catalysts for the h2 fed reductive treatment of water contaminants such as oxyanions for instance no3 no2 bro3 and clo4 and halogenated organic compounds for instance trichloroethane and chlorinated benzenes has been widely studied baumgartner et al 2013 chaplin et al 2006 choe et al 2015 guo et al 2018 li et al 2019 liu et al 2013 park et al 2019 baumgartner et al 2013 observed the complete hydrodefluorination of mono and poly fluorobenzene using an al2o3 supported rh catalyst which showed promise for use in the treatment of fluorinated pharmaceuticals however fluorinated pharmaceuticals are often more complex in their chemical structures than fluorobenzenes for example fluoxetine and levofloxacin have trifluoromethyl group instead of fluorine directly attached to aromatic rings while sitagliptin has fluorine attached to fused aromatic rings to best of our knowledge no attempt has yet been made to investigate the catalytic reductive treatment of fluorinated pharmaceuticals by the mono and bi metallic catalysts of these noble metals the overall goal of the present study is to explore the treatment of fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds via catalytic reduction among fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds levofloxacin sitagliptin and fluoxetine are chosen in this study for their occurrence in wastewater effluents and in surface water and also because they have different chemical structures and types of f substituents table 1 the specific objectives are to i investigate the catalytic reactivity and defluorination of the reductive degradation of the three fluorinated compounds using mono and bi metallic catalysts of ru rh pd and pt supported on alumina α

rpm using a magnetic stirrer pd rh pt and ru precursor solutions were freshly prepared and the given amount of two precursor solutions each corresponding to 1 wt metal loading were simultaneously added into the suspension under continuous stirring at 23 0 2 c for 2 h then the mixtures were dried at 105 ⁰c for 24 h in a dry oven and the dried samples were further calcined at 350 ⁰c for 2 h to stabilize metals on the surface of α al2o3 the calcined products were ground and stored in glass vials before kinetic experiments and catalyst characterization the given amount of bimetallic catalysts

washed with deaerated diw purged with n2 gas for 4 h twice to remove residual chemicals then the washed catalysts were used for batch experiments immediately monometallic catalysts pd α al2o3 rh α al2o3 pt α al2o3 and ru α al2o3 were also prepared similarly with a single precursor solution added to the suspension instead of two precursor solutions 2 2 reductive degradation of fluorinated

microscopy equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy fe tem edx prior to the analysis the bimetallic catalysts activated with nabh4 in section 2 1 were transferred to an anaerobic chamber coylab rinsed with deaerated deionized water 50 deaerated ethanol and 100 deaerated ethanol sequentially and then dispersed in deaerated ethanol to prevent oxidation the catalysts surface area was calculated from obtaining n2 sorption isotherms at 77 k additionally the chemical species of the metal catalysts ru rh pd and pt were characterized via x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the c 1 s peak at 285 ev was used as the reference for adjusting the surface charging effects 2 4 toxicity test and ecotoxicity prediction changes in the acute toxicity of the solution mixtures over the catalytic reduction of the fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds were measured via the microtox bioluminescence assay using aliivibrio fischeri antonopoulou and konstantinou 2014 briefly a vial of a

and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization a series of characterization techniques were carried out to investigate the physicochemical properties of the synthesized catalysts the bet surface areas of ru pt α al2o3 and rh pt α al2o3 were 1 97 m2 g and 2 03 m2 g respectively the fe tem images of the rh pd α al2o3 rh pt α al2o3 and ru pt α al2o3 catalysts fig a 1 and a 3 show that nano sized spherical particles were densely packed and uniformly dispersed on the surface of al2o3 the edx mappings in fig a 2 and a 4 showed the homogeneous distribution of pd rh pt ru al and o in the bimetallic catalysts the chemical speciation of the catalysts before and after reaction were characterized using xps figs a 5 and a 6 and no significant changes in metal species were observed more details of xps results are provided in appendix a 3 2 catalytic reduction of fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds 3 2 1 reduction kinetics the reductive degradation of the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds i e levofloxacin sitagliptin fluoxetine were observed in the presence of al2o3 supported metal catalysts for example 10 mg l of sitagliptin was reduced in an h2 saturated aqueous solution fig 1 a only minimal reduction 3 7 was observed with no metal catalyst in the presence of monometallic rh α al2o3 catalyst 65 8 4 8 of sitagliptin was degraded over 180 min the initial reaction rate followed a pseudo first order reaction with a rate constant of 0 0088 0 0013 l min gcat when bimetallic rh pt al2o3 catalyst was used more than 99 of sitagliptin was removed over 180 min this corresponds to a rate constant of 0 039 0 003l min gcat which is more than a four fold increase from that observed with the rh al2o3 catalyst in fig 1b the results show that bimetallic rh pt α al2o3 catalyst can reduce all three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds over 120 min of reaction 58 3 2 4 of levofloxacin and 95 38 0 54 of sitagliptin were catalytically degraded the degradation of fluoxetine was much faster in which more than 99 removal was observed within 5 min the catalytic reactivity of rh pt α al2o3 with the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds was in the order of fluoxetine sitagliptin levofloxacin with observed rate constants of 6 9 0 03 0 039 0 003 and 0 034 0 002l min gcat respectively based on the above results the processes of catalytic reduction of the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds were compared using four different monometallic catalysts i e ru rh pd and pt and six different combinations of bimetallic catalysts i e ru rh ru pd ru pt rh pd rh pt and pd pt deposited on α al2o3 supports the degradation kinetic profiles of these catalysts including al2o3 support only are shown in figs a 7 a 9 in appendix a fig 1c shows the pseudo first order rate constants of these catalysts for the reduction of levofloxacin sitagliptin and fluoxetine overall the general trend in catalytic reactivity with the fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds was similar to that of the rh pt α al2o3 catalyst and followed the order fluoxetine sitagliptin levofloxacin the rate constants were in the ranges of 2 4 21 4 0 0040 0 17 and 0 010 0 040 l min gcat for fluoxetine sitagliptin and levofloxacin respectively while the reactivity order was same enhanced reactivity up to 21 times higher was observed for γ al2o3 support catalysts fig a 18 and section a 5 in appendix a among the monometallic catalysts ru al2o3 could not degrade any of the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds as shown in fig 1c the pd α al2o3 and pt α al2o3 catalysts each degraded one fluorinated compound i e fluoxetine and sitagliptin respectively the rh α al2o3 catalyst degraded all three compounds but its reactivity with sitagliptin and fluoxetine were slightly slower than those of the pt α al2o3 and pd α al2o3 catalysts respectively all the bimetallic catalysts degraded the fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds with the exceptions of the pd pt α al2o3 catalyst which could not degrade levofloxacin it is interesting to note that while monometallic ru α al2o3 and pt α al2o3 cannot degrade fluoxetine ru pt α al2o3 can catalytically reduce fluoxetine with a reactivity comparable with those of the other catalysts enhanced reactivity of bimetallic catalysts over monometallic catalysts had been previously reported in many literature attributed to the changes in their catalytic properties e g formation of bimetallic alloy change in support nanoparticle interaction and or metal dispersion increase of active metal sites mironenko et al 2017 yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 among the bimetallic catalysts no single combination exhibited the highest reactivity for all the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds for instance the ru pt α al2o3 catalyst showed the highest reactivity for sitagliptin among all the bimetallic catalysts but the lowest reactivity for fluoxetine and levofloxacin in general the rh pt α al2o3 and rh pd α al2o3 catalysts showed relatively high reactivity for all the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds compared with those of the other bimetallic catalysts however it must be noted that while these monometallic and bimetallic catalysts could degrade the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds their reductive mechanisms were quite different as later discussed in section 3 3 3 2 2 defluorination fig 2 shows the kinetic profiles of defluorination over the reductive decay of levofloxacin sitagliptin and fluoxetine using select monometallic and bimetallic catalysts rh and rh pt for levofloxacin pt rh ru pt and rh pt for sitagliptin and rh pd rh pt and pd pt for fluoxetine the defluorination profiles of all the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts are additionally shown in figs a 7 a 9 in appendix a in the reductive treatment of levofloxacin using rh α al2o3 41 5 1 1 of f ion was released while 38 8 1 1 of the initial levofloxacin was degraded over 120 min fig 2a this is roughly equivalent to a 1 1 molar ratio of the quantity of f released to the quantity of levofloxacin degraded similarly bimetallic rh pt α al2o3 showed an f release of 65 4 11 6 over 120 min with the degradation of 58 3 2 4 of levofloxacin fig 2b fig a 7 shows that a 1 1 stoichiometric ratio of release of f ions to the quantity of levofloxacin degraded was observed with other bimetallic catalysts too i e ru pd α al2o3 rh pd α al2o3 and pd pt α al2o3 therefore the catalysts with higher catalytic reactivity for levofloxacin showed higher defluorination over a given reaction time with the monometallic rh α al2o3 and pt α al2o3 catalysts defluorination of 18 7 0 4 and 15 2 0 6 were observed during the degradation of 65 8 4 8 and 93 1 2 1 sitagliptin respectively over 180 min fig 2c these are equivalent to 28 4 and 16 3 respectively of total f in the degraded sitagliptin the pt α al2o3 catalyst showed higher reactivity than that of rh α al2o3 but lower defluorination the results suggest that the reductive mechanisms of sitagliptin are likely dependent on the type of metal catalyst using bimetallic ru pt α al2o3 and rh pt α al2o3 catalysts fig 2 d almost complete 99 sitagliptin degradation was observed over 180 min with higher defluorination 33 7 0 2 and 45 5 0 8 respectively than those obtained with monometallic catalysts other bimetallic catalysts showed both slower catalytic reactivity and lower defluorination compared with the ru pt α al2o3 and rh pt α al2o3 catalysts fig a 8 in the case of all the catalysts no more than 50 of the total f in degraded sitagliptin was released to the solution suggesting that only partial defluorination occurred during the catalytic reduction of sitagliptin while more than 95 of sitagliptin had been degraded within 60 min when the ru pt α al2o3 catalyst was used the defluorination continued to increase from 22 5 at 60 min to 33 7 at 180 min suggesting that successive defluorination of intermediate products could occur too similarly only partial defluorination of fluoxetine was observed for both the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts while rh α al2o3 and pd α al2o3 can degrade more than 99 of fluoxetine in 10 min a continuous increase in f was observed over 120 min fig 2 e both catalysts showed defluorination of approximately 40 the pd pt α al2o3 bimetallic catalyst too showed a similar trend fig 2 f interestingly the rh pt α al2o3 catalyst showed a different f release profile from the other catalysts there was a drastic increase in f up to 33 over 2 min 90 of fluoxetine had degraded by this time which was followed by a gradual decrease in dissolved f in the solution over an additional 120 min it may be possible that rh pt α al2o3 also catalyzes nucleophilic fluorination of f ion to organic electrophile intermediates produced during the reaction however further study is needed to validate this hypothesis furuya et al 2011 overall these results suggest that the catalytic reduction of fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds do not always entail complete defluorination thus highlighting the importance of intermediate characterization 3 2 3 intermediate characterization the degradation intermediates and products of levofloxacin sitagliptin and fluoxetine were characterized using lc ms and lc qtof ms during the catalytic reduction of levofloxacin only one peak m z 344 was newly observed in the lc ms chromatograms fig a 10 this corresponds to 9 desfluorolevofloxacin fig 3 which has the chemical structure of levofloxacin with f substituted with h fig a 10 shows that the peak area of 9 desfluorolevofloxacin continuously increased with reaction time and no further reduction of this degradation product was observed combined with the fact that the molar ratio of f detected in the solution to the quantity of levofloxacin degraded is 1 1 as discussed in section 3 2 2 these results suggest that the catalysts can effectively replace f on the quinolone ring structure with h under a condition of continuous h2 supply in the case of sitagliptin degradation multiple intermediate products were detected in addition to the sitagliptin peak m z 408 1 four peaks were observed in the lc ms chromatograms fig a 11 which were assigned to m z 390 1 372 1 354 1 and 360 2 the products corresponding to these m z values are herein referred to as tp390 tp372 tp354 and tp360 2 respectively sitagliptin and tp390 have a difference of m z 18 which corresponds to the substitution of f with h i e m f h similarly tp372 and tp354 correspond to two fluorine substitutions m 2f 2h and three fluorine substitutions m 3f 3h respectively from sitagliptin no additional peaks were observed suggesting that a maximum of three fluorine atoms out of six were removed from each sitagliptin molecule during its catalytic reduction these findings agree well with the defluorination observed in figs 2 c and d in which the maximum defluorination never exceeded 50 in sitagliptin three fluorine atoms are located on the benzene ring and the other three fluorine atoms exist as the trifluoromethyl group on triazolopyrazine to elucidate which fluorine atoms were removed to yield tp390 tp372 and tp354 the chemical structures of these intermediate products along with that of sitagliptin were further characterized via lc qtof ms in the product ion scan mode fig 4 the product ions detected for sitagliptin precursor m z of 408 1 were at m z values of 391 0994 235 0802 193 0695 174 0523 and 154 0462 fig 4 a the ion at m z 391 0994 was formed by the loss of nh3 the ions at m z values of 235 0802 and 174 0523 were formed by the cleavage of the cc bond in the middle of sitagliptin wherein the former corresponds to c8h9f3n4o the one with the trifluoromethyl group functionalized triazolopyrazine and the latter corresponds to c8h6f3n 2 2 4 5 trifluorophenyl ethan 1 imine table a 1 the ions at m z values of 193 0695 and 154 0462 were formed by the loss of c2h2o from m z 235 0802 and of hf from m z 174 0523 respectively these product ions monitored in our study are in good agreement with the fragment patterns of sitagliptin previously reported by others gumieniczek et al 2019 mowaka and mohamed 2015 the product ions of the intermediate tp390 were at m z values of 373 1091 235 0805 193 0697 156 0620 153 0508 and 136 0558 the peaks corresponding to m z values of 235 0805 and 193 0697 did not change from those detected in sitagliptin whereas the peak at m z 156 0620 corresponds to the loss of m z 18 from m z 174 0523 in sitagliptin these results suggest that defluorination occurs on the trifluorophenyl structure in sitagliptin instead of on the trifluoromethyl group similarly the product ion fragmentations of tp372 and tp354 showed peaks at m z values of 235 0804 and 193 0695 suggesting that defluorination did not occur at the trifluoromethyl site for tp372 and tp354 peaks at m z values of 138 0716 and 120 0813 were each observed which correspond to the mass loss of m z 36 two f substitution and m z 54 three f substitution from m z 174 0523 in sitagliptin tp360 is 6 046 da greater than tp354 implying the hydrogenation of the aromatic ring in the latter after complete defluorination based on the results obtained from the lc qtof ms analyses of sitagliptin and reaction intermediates it can be concluded that the catalytic reduction of sitagliptin undergoes successive defluorination of the trifluorophenyl group but not of the trifluoromethyl group during the degradation of fluoxetine two peaks m z 150 1 and 156 2 were newly observed in the lc ms chromatograms fig a 12 the m z value of 150 1 corresponds to n methyl 3 phenylpropan 1 amine nmpa and that of 156 2 corresponds to 3 cyclohexyl n methylpropan 1 amine cnma additionally a peak at m z 161 0 was identified when the lc ms analysis was performed in the negative ionization mode fig a 12 the gc ms characterization revealed this compound to be 4 trifluoromethyl phenol tfmp as shown in fig a 13 overall the identified intermediates of fluoxetine degradation are nmpa cnma and tfmp nmpa and tfmp are likely formed through the cleavage of the co bond in fluoxetine during catalytic degradation subsequently the phenyl group on nmpa was hydrogenated and converted into cnma by the active h on the catalyst surface 3 3 degradation pathways in the catalytic reduction of the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds the following three different degradation mechanisms were observed 1 hydrodefluorination of c f bond to ch bond 2 hydrogenation of aromatic ring and 3 reductive cleavage of co bond from phenyl ether fig 3 a shows the proposed degradation pathway of levofloxacin which is converted to 9 desfluorolevofloxacin via defluorination as discussed in section 3 2 2 the 1 1 molar ratio of degraded levofloxacin to released f suggests this is the only pathway observed for levofloxacin additionally the increase in the 9 desfluorolevofloxacin peak area in the lc ms spectra closely matches those of the f yields of rh α al2o3 and all the bimetallic catalysts fig a 7 fig 3 b shows the proposed degradation pathway of sitagliptin which undergoes sequential hydrodefluorination reactions intermediate characterization section 3 2 3 suggested that the three f atoms on aromatic hydrocarbon were defluorinated while those of the trifluoromethyl group on triazolopyrazine were not yielding a maximum defluorination ratio of 50 in the case of sitagliptin rajesh et al 2018 reported that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is localized to the trifluorophenyl ethanimine structure which may result in the preferential reaction of h2 or hads as the reductant electron donor to this site over the trifluoromethyl triazolopyrazine structure rajesh et al 2018 torres et al 2009 interestingly the rh α al2o3 and pt α al2o3 catalysts showed different patterns of preferred reactions a continuous increase in the peak areas of all the intermediates i e tp390 tp372 tp354 and tp360 was observed for rh α al2o3 while only minimal formation of tp354 and tp360 were observed for pt α al2o3 fig a 14 this result coincides with the defluorination of pt α al2o3 18 7 which is slightly higher than 16 67 one sixth of total f in sitagliptin while the rh α al2o3 catalyst can catalyze the hydrodefluorination of sitagliptin tp390 and tp372 as well as the hydrogenation of tp354 the pt α al2o3 catalyst seems to catalyze only the hydrodefluorination of sitagliptin selectively and has less preference for the hydrodefluorination of the intermediate products similarly intermediate formation and degradation patterns vary among the bimetallic catalysts fig a 14 ru pt α al2o3 and rh pt α al2o3 showed an initial build up of tp390 followed by a gradual increase in tp354 a continuous increase in tp360 was observed for all the bimetallic catalysts except pd pt α al2o3 these findings suggest that metal catalysts can be tailored to achieve selective control over preferential degradation pathways and minimize the formation of undesired intermediates in the case of fluoxetine the reductive cleavage of co bond preceded ring hydrogenation and defluorination as shown in fig 3 c while pd α al2o3 exhibited high activity for the cleavage of co bond resulting in the rapid accumulation of nmpa only a negligible amount of cnma was detected fig 5 a suggesting that pd cannot effectively hydrogenate nmpa into cnma on the contrary rh α al2o3 completely hydrogenated nmpa into cnma within 60 min indicating that the rh based catalyst is capable of both co cleavage and ring hydrogenation in the case of bimetallic catalysts hydrogenation of nmpa to cnma was observed with all catalysts except pd pt α al2o3 fig 5 b considering almost no reactivity of the pt α al2o3 and ru α al2o3 catalysts toward co bond cleavage a remarkable increase in kobs for fluoxetine decomposition by pt ru α al2o3 2 48 0 12 l min gcat was observed time profiles of nmpa and cnma for all monometallic and bimetallic catalysts are also shown in fig a 15 concurrently the intermediate tfmp underwent reductive degradation as shown in figs 5 and a 16 in the case of the pd α al2o3 catalyst the degradation of tfmp observed over 120 min 40 closely matches with the defluorination of 41 2 1 9 fig 5 c suggesting complete defluorination of the trifluoromethyl group on tfmp to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that hydrodefluorination of perfluoroalkyl i e trifluoromethyl group via metal catalyst using h2 as reductant has been reported in the case of rh α al2o3 the observed degradation of tfmp 74 does not match with the defluorination of 41 1 9 suggesting only partial defluorination of tfmp fig 5 c while bimetallic catalysts such as rh pt rh pd and ru rh showed enhanced tfmp degradation efficiency compared with that of monometallic catalysts there was no observable enhancement in defluorination fig a 9 hence the reaction mixtures of fluoxetine and tfmp as a starting compound reduction by pd pd pt and rh pt were analyzed via gc ms fig a 13 it was found that the main fragments of p cresol i e m z 51 77 79 107 and 108 were identified in tfmp reduction by pd α al2o3 indicating that tfmp was transformed into p cresol by the replacement of three f atoms with h fig a 17 we additionally observed the appearance of three peaks which were assigned to m z values of 166 168 i and 168 ii in the case of rh pt α al2o3 fig a 13 the peaks at m z 166 and m z 168 could be 4 trifluoromethyl cyclohex 2 en 1 ol and 4 trifluoromethyl cyclohexan 1 ol respectively in contrast those peaks were not detected for pd α al2o3 and pd pt α al2o3 the results suggest that while pd α al2o3 and pd pt α al2o3 mainly catalyze defluorination pathway for tfmp reduction rh pt α al2o3 can catalyze both defluorination and hydrogenation of tfmp while hydrodefluorination of fluorinated organics using h2 as electron donor should lower ph according to the following equation 3 r f h 2 r h f h the ph change observed during the reaction was 0 5 for all reactions this may be due to functional moieties in fluorinated pharmaceuticals and their transformed products serving as a buffer and or degradation pathways other than hydrodefluorination results in ph increase overall the results of the catalytic degradation of levofloxacin sitagliptin and fluoxetine by mono and bi metallic catalysts showed that different monometallic and bimetallic catalysts show not only result in different reaction rates but also different reduction pathways for example rh based and ru pt catalysts can catalyze the defluorination of fluoroaromatics as well as hydrogenation of benzene rings while pd and pd pt catalysts have more selective preference for the defluorination of trifluoromethyl groups both pd based and rh based catalysts can catalyze the reductive cleavage of co bond from phenyl ether these different degradation mechanisms of fluorinated pharmaceuticals by different catalysts are summarized in table a 2 in appendix a 3 4 influence of reductive transformation of fluorinated pharmaceuticals on their toxicity to investigate the toxicity changes during the reductive transformation of fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds the lc50 and ec50 values of levofloxacin sitagliptin fluoxetine and their identified transformation products to different species i e d magna fish green algae mysid were predicted using the ecosar program as shown in table 2 in the case of all three fluorinated pharmaceuticals the defluorinated intermediates showed increased lc50 values compared with those of the parent compound for example 9 desfluorolovofloxacin has a d magna lc50 of 2 25 103 mg l which is slightly higher than that of levofloxacin 1 79 103 mg l similarly the successive defluorination of sitagliptin to the intermediates tp390 tp372 and tp354 slightly reduced the toxicity of the pharmaceutical compound whereby the l50 values of sitagliptin tp390 tp372 and tp354 for d magna were 21 9 27 6 34 9 and 43 9 mg l respectively most of the other intermediates too showed higher lc50 values than that of the parent compound with the exception of tp360 which showed approximately three times more acute toxicity than sitagliptin fluoxetine degradation products also showed lower toxicity than their parent compound lc50 values of fluoxetine nmpa and tfmp for d magna were 0 175 1 66 and 5 59 mg l respectively when tfmp is defluorinated to p cresol its lc50 value also slightly increased to 5 96 mg l however hydrogenation of nmpa to cmpa increased its toxicity i e lc50 of 0 397 mg l similar trends were also observed with lc50 and ec50 values for other species i e fish green algae and mysid toxicity prediction using ecosar program suggested that defluorination of three fluorinated pharmaceuticals compounds generally lowered their toxicity while hydrogenation of intermediates can increase their toxicity however these trends may not be applicable to all fluorinated pharmaceuticals to experimentally evaluate the change in overall toxicity during the catalytic reduction of the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds the bioluminescence inhibition of a fischeri was quantified for the catalyst treated samples obtained at different reaction times as shown in fig 6 no significant change was observed in the bioluminescence inhibition of both levofloxacin and sitagliptin over their degradation as discussed in section 3 3 different patterns of intermediate formation were observed in the case of sitagliptin degradation with the pt α al2o3 rh pt α al2o3 and ru pt α al2o3 catalysts for example high tp390 and minimal tp360 formation were monitored for pt al2o3 whereas high tp360 and low tp390 tp372 and tp354 formation were observed for rh pt al2o3 fig a 14 while the ecosar predicted lc50 and ec50 values of tp360 were lower than those of sitagliptin these different patterns of intermediate formation using different catalysts did not seem to influence the bioluminescence inhibition of a fischeri fig 6 b in the case of fluoxetine toxicity change was monitored with pd α al2o3 and rh pt α al2o3 to investigate the effect of the different reaction pathways with both catalysts inhibition increased from 59 1 0 3 initially to 80 87 at 15 min fig 6 c thereafter the inhibition gradually decreased to 55 1 5 1 for rh pt α al2o3 but continued to increase to 93 8 0 3 for pd α al2o3 at 120 min both the catalysts had reduced more than 99 of fluoxetine at 15 min suggesting that the intermediates have higher toxicity than the parent compound the toxic intermediates were further transformed into less toxic compounds in the case of rh pt α al2o3 as discussed in section 3 3 tfmp and its defluorinated compounds for instance p cresol in addition to nmpa are the major transformation products identified when the pd catalyst is used while both hydrogenated and defluorinated intermediates of tmfp i e 4 trifluoromethyl cyclohex 2 en 1 ol and 4 trifluoromethyl cyclohexan 1 ol in addition to cnma are the major products when the rh pt catalysts are used fig 5 interestingly ecosar predicted that the ec50 value of fluoxetine was lower than those of all identified intermediate products table 2 which contradicts the spike observed at 15 min in our experimental results of the inhibition of luminescence of a fischeri the inconsistency between the lc50 and ec50 values of aquatic organisms as predicted by ecosar and the bioluminescent inhibition of a fischeri could be owing to several reasons first the toxicity values of the fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds and their intermediates differ between the aquatic organisms in the ecosar model and a fischeri owing to variations in their ability to metabolize the compounds tested second it is possible that the ecotoxicty prediction via chemical structure based ecosar model has limited accuracy for fluorinated pharmaceuticals and their intermediates carpinteiro et al 2017 third unidentified intermediates could have high toxicity governing the overall toxicity of the reaction mixture for instance kuang et al 2013 observed increased toxicity using a fischeri inhibition during the ozonation of trimethoprim although ecosar predicted lower toxicity for all the intermediates identified than that of trimethoprim kuang et al 2013 they speculated that ring opened secondary products such as aldehyde have high toxicity for the catalytic reduction of ring containing compounds would not lead to ring opening and thus we anticipate that the formation of secondary products would be minimal last the toxicity behavior of chemicals in mixture do not correspond to those of pure compounds altenburger et al 2003 further study is needed to carefully characterize and assess the reductive transformation products and their overall toxicity change not only for these three fluorinated compounds but also for other fluorinated pharmaceuticals compounds as well nonetheless our results suggest that the catalytic reduction of levofloxacin sitagliptin and fluoxetine by bimetallic rh pt alumina catalysts led to the degradation of the parent compounds without forming intermediates and products that are significantly more toxic 4 conclusion in this study the catalytic reduction of three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds levofloxacin sitagliptin and fluoxetine were investigated using monometallic and bimetallic catalysts of pt group noble metals i e ru rh pd pt under ambient temperature and pressure conditions catalytic degradation of all three compounds were observed with general reactivity following the order fluoxetine sitagliptin levofloxacin a single transformation product 9 desfluorolevofloxacin was observed in the reduction of levofloxacin while multiple intermediates were observed for sitagliptin and fluoxetine in the case of sitagliptin the successive defluorination of the trifluorophenyl group led to the formation of three intermediates i e tp390 tp372 tp354 while the trifluoromethyl group was intact furthermore some catalysts further reduced tp354 to tp360 via hydrogenation of benzene ring in the case of fluoxetine the rapid degradation of the parent compound via co bond cleavage resulted in the formation of nmpa and tfmp followed by subsequent hydrogenation of these intermediates in this study three different degradation mechanisms hydrodefluorination of c f bond to ch bond hydrogenation of aromatic ring and reductive cleavage of co bond from phenyl ether were observed in which the type of catalyst metal influenced the preference for specific reduction pathways toxicity assessment using a fischeri showed there were no significant changes in toxicity over the catalytic reduction of levofloxacin and sitagliptin regardless of the formation of different intermediates in the case of fluoxetine enhanced toxicity was observed during catalytic reduction using monometallic pd α al2o3 suggesting the importance of degradation pathways and choice of catalyst metals to be used differences between the experimental results and the acute toxicity values predicted using the ecosar program were observed overall catalytic reduction efficiently degraded the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds levofloxacin sitagliptin and fluoxetine however the potential hazards of the catalytic reduction of fluorinated pharmaceuticals merits further evaluation furthermore there needs a continuous research to systematically elucidate the fate and transformation of fluorinated pharmaceuticals and their toxicological impacts over reductive and oxidative processes to ensure the safety of humans and the environment from these emerging contaminants

17604,recently an increasing number of pharmaceutical compounds has become fluorinated owing to their pharmacological efficacy the use of these fluorinated pharmaceuticals continues to grow and they constitute 20 of the drugs on the current market however only a few studies have investigated the fate and transformation of these emerging contaminants in natural and engineered aquatic environments in the present study the h2 based reductive transformation of three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds levofloxacin sitagliptin and fluoxetine were investigated using alumina supported monometallic and bimetallic catalysts of the pt group noble metals i e ru rh pd and pt under ambient temperature and pressure conditions degradation of all three compounds was observed with catalytic reactivity ranging from 4 0 10 3 to 2 14 102 l min gcat in which fluoxetine generally showed the highest reactivity followed by sitagliptin and levofloxacin the fluorination yields and transformation products were characterized for each fluorinated compound and three different degradation mechanisms were elucidated 1 hydrodefluorination of c f bond to ch bond 2 hydrogenation of aromatic ring and 3 reductive cleavage of co bond from phenyl ether toxicity assessment using aliivibrio fischeri showed there were no significant changes in toxicity over levofloxacin and sitagliptin degradation suggesting the formation of no highly toxic by products during catalytic reduction for fluoxetine an increased toxicity was observed during its degradation while ecosar predicted toxicity values of all identified intermediates were lower than that of fluoxetine suggesting the formation of unidentified secondary by products that contribute to the overall toxicity the study showed that catalytic reduction is a promising remediation process for treating and defluorinating the fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fluorinated pharmaceuticals emerging contaminants catalytic degradation reductive treatment defluorination water treatment 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products are contaminants of emerging concern and their fate and transformation in engineered and natural systems have been studied extensively yang et al 2012 in the pharmaceutical industry significant attention has been paid to the synthesis and development of f containing pharmaceuticals over the last two decades murphy 2016 piccionello et al 2019 the high electronegativity and stability of c f bonds enable fluorinated pharmaceuticals to have significantly improved lipophilicity and metabolic stability compared with those of non fluorinated analogues thereby enhancing their pharmacological effects in the human body trojanowicz et al 2018 owing to their advantages pharmaceuticals containing fluorinated aromatic rings or trifluoromethyl substituents have been continuously growing in use and now over 20 of the drugs on the current market are fluorinated mei et al 2019 wang et al 2014 while fluorinated pharmaceuticals are rapidly increasing in dominance in the pharmaceutical market only limited studies to date are available for elucidating their fate and ecological impact on the environment the emerging occurrence of fluorinated pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments at levels of ng l to μg l was recently reported salazar et al 2017 for instance fluoxetine also known as prozac table 1 is a fluorinated antidepressant widely detected in multiple countries across the world in the concentration range 0 4 3645 ng l in wastewater influents silva et al 2012 levofloxacin a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and sitagliptin a new oral anti diabetic agent for type ii diabetes were also frequently detected in surface water and effluents from municipal and hospital wastewater treatment in the range of 62 4 186 ng l for levofloxacin and 35 117 ng l for sitagliptin abo haded et al 2017 balakrishna et al 2017 kim et al 2009 martín et al 2012 levofloxacin was reported to adversely affect aquatic organisms and cause bacterial resistance in the environment while sitagliptin showed carcinogenic potential in animals and cytotoxicity and genotoxicity for human lymphocytes doorslaer et al 2014 yuzbasioglu et al 2018 conventional physicochemical and biological processes in water and wastewater treatment plants showed poor removal of fluoxetine and levofloxacin epold et al 2015 hamdi et al 2013 kwon and armbrust 2006 radjenovic et al 2007 yang et al 2017 chemical treatments such as advanced oxidation processes for instance ultraviolet tio2 processes fenton and photo fenton reactions ozonation sonolysis and photo based treatments have been investigated for a few fluorinated compounds such as fluoxetine ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin chen et al 2020 lima et al 2017 méndez arriaga et al 2011 salazar et al 2017 tay and madehi 2015 zhao et al 2017 although these oxidative treatment processes efficiently degrade the parent fluorinated compounds only partial mineralization was observed resulting in the formation of by products including fluorinated species chen et al 2020 zhao et al 2017 these fluorinated intermediates are likely to be highly stable and recalcitrant in the environment owing to the c f bond and can be converted into more toxic metabolites by biotic and abiotic processes murphy 2016 for instance bel et al 2009 reported that the oxidative treatment of ciprofloxacin via sonolysis led to increased toxicity for green algae suggesting the formation of a more toxic f containing degradation product bel et al 2009 reductive treatments of fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds are much less explored angelo et al 2014 found that zerovalent iron can reduce ciprofloxacin via a partial defluorination pathway the applicability of the pt group noble metals i e ru rh pd and pt as catalysts for the h2 fed reductive treatment of water contaminants such as oxyanions for instance no3 no2 bro3 and clo4 and halogenated organic compounds for instance trichloroethane and chlorinated benzenes has been widely studied baumgartner et al 2013 chaplin et al 2006 choe et al 2015 guo et al 2018 li et al 2019 liu et al 2013 park et al 2019 baumgartner et al 2013 observed the complete hydrodefluorination of mono and poly fluorobenzene using an al2o3 supported rh catalyst which showed promise for use in the treatment of fluorinated pharmaceuticals however fluorinated pharmaceuticals are often more complex in their chemical structures than fluorobenzenes for example fluoxetine and levofloxacin have trifluoromethyl group instead of fluorine directly attached to aromatic rings while sitagliptin has fluorine attached to fused aromatic rings to best of our knowledge no attempt has yet been made to investigate the catalytic reductive treatment of fluorinated pharmaceuticals by the mono and bi metallic catalysts of these noble metals the overall goal of the present study is to explore the treatment of fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds via catalytic reduction among fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds levofloxacin sitagliptin and fluoxetine are chosen in this study for their occurrence in wastewater effluents and in surface water and also because they have different chemical structures and types of f substituents table 1 the specific objectives are to i investigate the catalytic reactivity and defluorination of the reductive degradation of the three fluorinated compounds using mono and bi metallic catalysts of ru rh pd and pt supported on alumina α al2o3 ii identify the major transformation products iii elucidate possible degradation mechanisms and pathways for the catalytic reduction of these fluorinated pharmaceuticals and iv monitor the toxicity profiles during the catalytic reductive transformation of these compounds the results from this contribution are used to address the applicability of catalytic reduction in treating fluorinated pharmaceuticals and offer new insights into the potential impact of the process on their fate and ecological impact in natural and engineered water systems 2 materials and experimental methods 2 1 chemical reagents and catalyst preparation sources of chemical reagents are provided in appendix a section a 1 bimetallic catalysts were synthesized using the modified impregnation method jung et al 2012 alumina 1 0 g was added to 100 ml of diw in a polypropylene bottle and the mixture was sonicated for 5 min using a bath sonicator wuc d10h daihan korea and continuously stirred at 500 rpm using a magnetic stirrer pd rh pt and ru precursor solutions were freshly prepared and the given amount of two precursor solutions each corresponding to 1 wt metal loading were simultaneously added into the suspension under continuous stirring at 23 0 2 c for 2 h then the mixtures were dried at 105 ⁰c for 24 h in a dry oven and the dried samples were further calcined at 350 ⁰c for 2 h to stabilize metals on the surface of α al2o3 the calcined products were ground and stored in glass vials before kinetic experiments and catalyst characterization the given amount of bimetallic catalysts was activated by a dropwise addition of 25 mm nabh4 leading to chemical reduction of pd rh pt and ru metals the activated catalysts were vacuum filtered using 0 2 μm membrane filter advantac japan and washed with deaerated diw purged with n2 gas for 4 h twice to remove residual chemicals then the washed catalysts were used for batch experiments immediately monometallic catalysts pd α al2o3 rh α al2o3 pt α al2o3 and ru α al2o3 were also prepared similarly with a single precursor solution added to the suspension instead of two precursor solutions 2 2 reductive degradation of fluorinated pharmaceuticals detailed description of kinetic experiment procedure is provided in appendix a section a 2 briefly catalyst was added to unbuffered aqueous solution sonicated and continuously stirred then h2 gas was bubbled into the reactor for 20 min and the catalytic reaction was initiated by adding the target fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds the sample aliquots were periodically extracted and filtered and stored for the analysis all experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate 2 3 analytical detailed description of analytical techniques and their methods is provided in appendix a section a 3 the concentrations of the fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds and tfmp were analyzed via single quadrupole liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms intermediate products of sitagliptin were also analyzed using lc equipped with quadrupole time of flight ms lc qtof ms the concentration of f ions in the solution was quantified using an ion chromatography ic the reaction

molecule i e x 1 for levofloxacin 3 for fluoxetine and 6 for sitagliptin the morphology and metal dispersion of the bimetallic catalysts were characterized via field emission transmission electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy fe tem edx prior to the analysis the bimetallic catalysts activated with nabh4 in section 2 1 were transferred to an anaerobic chamber coylab rinsed with deaerated deionized water 50 deaerated ethanol and 100 deaerated ethanol sequentially and then dispersed in deaerated ethanol to prevent oxidation the catalysts surface area was calculated from obtaining n2 sorption isotherms at 77 k additionally the chemical species of the metal catalysts ru rh pd and pt were characterized via x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps the c 1 s peak at 285 ev was used as the reference for adjusting the surface charging effects 2 4 toxicity test and ecotoxicity prediction changes in the acute toxicity of the solution mixtures over the catalytic reduction of the fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds were measured via the microtox bioluminescence assay using aliivibrio fischeri antonopoulou and konstantinou 2014 briefly a vial of a fischeri was activated by the addition of 1 0 ml of microtox reconstitution solution followed by incubation at 4 ⁰c the sample aliquots extracted in section 2 2 were added to a microtox diluent 2 nacl and the luminescence was recorded after 5 min of exposure at 15 ⁰c using a microtox model 500 analyser modern water inc u k inhibition in luminescence was estimated according to the microtox protocol

and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization a series of characterization techniques were carried out to investigate the physicochemical properties of the synthesized catalysts the bet surface areas of ru pt α al2o3 and rh pt α al2o3 were 1 97 m2 g and 2 03 m2 g respectively the fe tem images of the rh pd α al2o3 rh pt α al2o3 and ru pt α al2o3 catalysts fig a 1 and a 3 show that nano sized spherical particles were densely packed and uniformly dispersed on the surface of al2o3 the edx mappings in fig a 2 and a 4 showed the homogeneous distribution of pd rh pt ru al and o in the bimetallic catalysts the chemical speciation of the catalysts before and after reaction were characterized using xps figs a 5 and a 6 and no significant changes in metal species were observed more details of xps results are provided in appendix a 3 2 catalytic reduction of fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds 3 2 1 reduction kinetics the reductive degradation of the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds i e levofloxacin sitagliptin fluoxetine were observed in the presence of al2o3 supported metal catalysts for example 10 mg l of sitagliptin was reduced in an h2 saturated aqueous solution fig 1 a only minimal reduction 3 7 was observed with no metal catalyst in the presence of monometallic rh α al2o3 catalyst 65 8 4 8 of sitagliptin was degraded over 180 min the initial reaction rate followed a pseudo first order reaction with a rate constant of 0 0088 0 0013 l min gcat when bimetallic rh pt al2o3 catalyst was used more than 99 of sitagliptin was removed over 180 min this corresponds to a rate constant of 0 039 0 003l min gcat which is more than a four fold increase from that observed with the rh al2o3 catalyst in fig 1b the results show that bimetallic rh pt α al2o3 catalyst can reduce all three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds over 120 min of reaction 58 3 2 4 of levofloxacin and 95 38 0 54 of sitagliptin were catalytically degraded the degradation of fluoxetine was much faster in which more than 99 removal was observed within 5 min the catalytic reactivity of rh pt α al2o3 with the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds was in the order of fluoxetine sitagliptin levofloxacin with observed rate constants of 6 9 0 03 0 039 0 003 and 0 034 0 002l min gcat respectively based on the above results the processes of catalytic reduction of the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds were compared using four different monometallic catalysts i e ru rh pd and pt and six different combinations of bimetallic catalysts i e ru rh ru pd ru pt rh pd rh pt and pd pt deposited on α al2o3 supports the degradation kinetic profiles of these catalysts including al2o3 support only are shown in figs a 7 a 9 in appendix a fig 1c shows the pseudo first order rate constants of these catalysts for the reduction of levofloxacin sitagliptin and fluoxetine overall the general trend in catalytic reactivity with the fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds was similar to that of the rh pt α al2o3 catalyst and followed the order fluoxetine sitagliptin levofloxacin the rate constants were in the ranges of 2 4 21 4 0 0040 0 17 and 0 010 0 040 l min gcat for fluoxetine sitagliptin and levofloxacin respectively while the reactivity order was same enhanced reactivity up to 21 times higher was observed for γ al2o3 support catalysts fig a 18 and section a 5 in appendix a among the monometallic catalysts ru al2o3 could not degrade any of the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds as shown in fig 1c the pd α al2o3 and pt α al2o3 catalysts each degraded one fluorinated compound i e fluoxetine and sitagliptin respectively the rh α al2o3 catalyst degraded all three compounds but its reactivity with sitagliptin and fluoxetine were slightly slower than those of the pt α al2o3 and pd α al2o3 catalysts respectively all the bimetallic catalysts degraded the fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds with the exceptions of the pd pt α al2o3 catalyst which could not degrade levofloxacin it is interesting to note that while monometallic ru α al2o3 and pt α al2o3 cannot degrade fluoxetine ru pt α al2o3 can catalytically reduce fluoxetine with a reactivity comparable with those of the other catalysts enhanced reactivity of bimetallic catalysts over monometallic catalysts had been previously reported in many literature attributed to the changes in their catalytic properties e g formation of bimetallic alloy change in support nanoparticle interaction and or metal dispersion increase of active metal sites mironenko et al 2017 yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 among the bimetallic catalysts no single combination exhibited the highest reactivity for all the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds for instance the ru pt α al2o3 catalyst showed the highest reactivity for sitagliptin among all the bimetallic catalysts but the lowest reactivity for fluoxetine and levofloxacin in general the rh pt α al2o3 and rh pd α al2o3 catalysts showed relatively high reactivity for all the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds compared with those of the other bimetallic catalysts however it must be noted that while these monometallic and bimetallic catalysts could degrade the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds their reductive mechanisms were quite different as later discussed in section 3 3 3 2 2 defluorination fig 2 shows the kinetic profiles of defluorination over the reductive decay of levofloxacin sitagliptin and fluoxetine using select monometallic and bimetallic catalysts rh and rh pt for levofloxacin pt rh ru pt and rh pt for sitagliptin and rh pd rh pt and pd pt for fluoxetine the defluorination profiles of all the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts are additionally shown in figs a 7 a 9 in appendix a in the reductive treatment of levofloxacin using rh α al2o3 41 5 1 1 of f ion was released while 38 8 1 1 of the initial levofloxacin was degraded over 120 min fig 2a this is roughly equivalent to a 1 1 molar ratio of the quantity of f released to the quantity of levofloxacin degraded similarly bimetallic rh pt α al2o3 showed an f release of 65 4 11 6 over 120 min with the degradation of 58 3 2 4 of levofloxacin fig 2b fig a 7 shows that a 1 1 stoichiometric ratio of release of f ions to the quantity of levofloxacin degraded was observed with other bimetallic catalysts too i e ru pd α al2o3 rh pd α al2o3 and pd pt α al2o3 therefore the catalysts with higher catalytic reactivity for levofloxacin showed higher defluorination over a given reaction time with the monometallic rh α al2o3 and pt α al2o3 catalysts defluorination of 18 7 0 4 and 15 2 0 6 were observed during the degradation of 65 8 4 8 and 93 1 2 1 sitagliptin respectively over 180 min fig 2c these are equivalent to 28 4 and 16 3 respectively of total f in the degraded sitagliptin the pt α al2o3 catalyst showed higher reactivity than that of rh α al2o3 but lower defluorination the results suggest that the reductive mechanisms of sitagliptin are likely dependent on the type of metal catalyst using bimetallic ru pt α al2o3 and rh pt α al2o3 catalysts fig 2 d almost complete 99 sitagliptin degradation was observed over 180 min with higher defluorination 33 7 0 2 and 45 5 0 8 respectively than those obtained with monometallic catalysts other bimetallic catalysts showed both slower catalytic reactivity and lower defluorination compared with the ru pt α al2o3 and rh pt α al2o3 catalysts fig a 8 in the case of all the catalysts no more than 50 of the total f in degraded sitagliptin was released to the solution suggesting that only partial defluorination occurred during the catalytic reduction of sitagliptin while more than 95 of sitagliptin had been degraded within 60 min when the ru pt α al2o3 catalyst was used the defluorination continued to increase from 22 5 at 60 min to 33 7 at 180 min suggesting that successive defluorination of intermediate products could occur too similarly only partial defluorination of fluoxetine was observed for both the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts while rh α al2o3 and pd α al2o3 can degrade more than 99 of fluoxetine in 10 min a continuous increase in f was observed over 120 min fig 2 e both catalysts showed defluorination of approximately 40 the pd pt α al2o3 bimetallic catalyst too showed a similar trend fig 2 f interestingly the rh pt α al2o3 catalyst showed a different f release profile from the other catalysts there was a drastic increase in f up to 33 over 2 min 90 of fluoxetine had degraded by this time which was followed by a gradual decrease in dissolved f in the solution over an additional 120 min it may be possible that rh pt α al2o3 also catalyzes nucleophilic fluorination of f ion to organic electrophile intermediates produced during the reaction however further study is needed to validate this hypothesis furuya et al 2011 overall these results suggest that the catalytic reduction of fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds do not always entail complete defluorination thus highlighting the importance of intermediate characterization 3 2 3 intermediate characterization the degradation intermediates and products of levofloxacin sitagliptin and fluoxetine were characterized using lc ms and lc qtof ms during the catalytic reduction of levofloxacin only one peak m z 344 was newly observed in the lc ms chromatograms fig a 10 this corresponds to 9 desfluorolevofloxacin fig 3 which has the chemical structure of levofloxacin with f substituted with h fig a 10 shows that the peak area of 9 desfluorolevofloxacin continuously increased with reaction time and no further reduction of this degradation product was observed combined with the fact that the molar ratio of f detected in the solution to the quantity of levofloxacin degraded is 1 1 as discussed in section 3 2 2 these results suggest that the catalysts can effectively replace f on the quinolone ring structure with h under a condition of continuous h2 supply in the case of sitagliptin degradation multiple intermediate products were detected in addition to the sitagliptin peak m z 408 1 four peaks were observed in the lc ms chromatograms fig a 11 which were assigned to m z 390 1 372 1 354 1 and 360 2 the products corresponding to these m z values are herein referred to as tp390 tp372 tp354 and tp360 2 respectively sitagliptin and tp390 have a difference of m z 18 which corresponds to the substitution of f with h i e m f h similarly tp372 and tp354 correspond to two fluorine substitutions m 2f 2h and three fluorine substitutions m 3f 3h respectively from sitagliptin no additional peaks were observed suggesting that a maximum of three fluorine atoms out of six were removed from each sitagliptin molecule during its catalytic reduction these findings agree well with the defluorination observed in figs 2 c and d in which the maximum defluorination never exceeded 50 in sitagliptin three fluorine atoms are located on the benzene ring and the other three fluorine atoms exist as the trifluoromethyl group on triazolopyrazine to elucidate which fluorine atoms were removed to yield tp390 tp372 and tp354 the chemical structures of these intermediate products along with that of sitagliptin were further characterized via lc qtof ms in the product ion scan mode fig 4 the product ions detected for sitagliptin precursor m z of 408 1 were at m z values of 391 0994 235 0802 193 0695 174 0523 and 154 0462 fig 4 a the ion at m z 391 0994 was formed by the loss of nh3 the ions at m z values of 235 0802 and 174 0523 were formed by the cleavage of the cc bond in the middle of sitagliptin wherein the former corresponds to c8h9f3n4o the one with the trifluoromethyl group functionalized triazolopyrazine and the latter corresponds to c8h6f3n 2 2 4 5 trifluorophenyl ethan 1 imine table a 1 the ions at m z values of 193 0695 and 154 0462 were formed by the loss of c2h2o from m z 235 0802 and of hf from m z 174 0523 respectively these product ions monitored in our study are in good agreement with the fragment patterns of sitagliptin previously reported by others gumieniczek et al 2019 mowaka and mohamed 2015 the product ions of the intermediate tp390 were at m z values of 373 1091 235 0805 193 0697 156 0620 153 0508 and 136 0558 the peaks corresponding to m z values of 235 0805 and 193 0697 did not change from those detected in sitagliptin whereas the peak at m z 156 0620 corresponds to the loss of m z 18 from m z 174 0523 in sitagliptin these results suggest that defluorination occurs on the trifluorophenyl structure in sitagliptin instead of on the trifluoromethyl group similarly the product ion fragmentations of tp372 and tp354 showed peaks at m z values of 235 0804 and 193 0695 suggesting that defluorination did not occur at the trifluoromethyl site for tp372 and tp354 peaks at m z values of 138 0716 and 120 0813 were each observed which correspond to the mass loss of m z 36 two f substitution and m z 54 three f substitution from m z 174 0523 in sitagliptin tp360 is 6 046 da greater than tp354 implying the hydrogenation of the aromatic ring in the latter after complete defluorination based on the results obtained from the lc qtof ms analyses of sitagliptin and reaction intermediates it can be concluded that the catalytic reduction of sitagliptin undergoes successive defluorination of the trifluorophenyl group but not of the trifluoromethyl group during the degradation of fluoxetine two peaks m z 150 1 and 156 2 were newly observed in the lc ms chromatograms fig a 12 the m z value of 150 1 corresponds to n methyl 3 phenylpropan 1 amine nmpa and that of 156 2 corresponds to 3 cyclohexyl n methylpropan 1 amine cnma additionally a peak at m z 161 0 was identified when the lc ms analysis was performed in the negative ionization mode fig a 12 the gc ms characterization revealed this compound to be 4 trifluoromethyl phenol tfmp as shown in fig a 13 overall the identified intermediates of fluoxetine degradation are nmpa cnma and tfmp nmpa and tfmp are likely formed through the cleavage of the co bond in fluoxetine during catalytic degradation subsequently the phenyl group on nmpa was hydrogenated and converted into cnma by the active h on the catalyst surface 3 3 degradation pathways in the catalytic reduction of the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds the following three different degradation mechanisms were observed 1 hydrodefluorination of c f bond to ch bond 2 hydrogenation of aromatic ring and 3 reductive cleavage of co bond from phenyl ether fig 3 a shows the proposed degradation pathway of levofloxacin which is converted to 9 desfluorolevofloxacin via defluorination as discussed in section 3 2 2 the 1 1 molar ratio of degraded levofloxacin to released f suggests this is the only pathway observed for levofloxacin additionally the increase in the 9 desfluorolevofloxacin peak area in the lc ms spectra closely matches those of the f yields of rh α al2o3 and all the bimetallic catalysts fig a 7 fig 3 b shows the proposed degradation pathway of sitagliptin which undergoes sequential hydrodefluorination reactions intermediate characterization section 3 2 3 suggested that the three f atoms on aromatic hydrocarbon were defluorinated while those of the trifluoromethyl group on triazolopyrazine were not yielding a maximum defluorination ratio of 50 in the case of sitagliptin rajesh et al 2018 reported that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is localized to the trifluorophenyl ethanimine structure which may result in the preferential reaction of h2 or hads as the reductant electron donor to this site over the trifluoromethyl triazolopyrazine structure rajesh et al 2018 torres et al 2009 interestingly the rh α al2o3 and pt α al2o3 catalysts showed different patterns of preferred reactions a continuous increase in the peak areas of all the intermediates i e tp390 tp372 tp354 and tp360 was observed for rh α al2o3 while only minimal formation of tp354 and tp360 were observed for pt α al2o3 fig a 14 this result coincides with the defluorination of pt α al2o3 18 7 which is slightly higher than 16 67 one sixth of total f in sitagliptin while the rh α al2o3 catalyst can catalyze the hydrodefluorination of sitagliptin tp390 and tp372 as well as the hydrogenation of tp354 the pt α al2o3 catalyst seems to catalyze only the hydrodefluorination of sitagliptin selectively and has less preference for the hydrodefluorination of the intermediate products similarly intermediate formation and degradation patterns vary among the bimetallic catalysts fig a 14 ru pt α al2o3 and rh pt α al2o3 showed an initial build up of tp390 followed by a gradual increase in tp354 a continuous increase in tp360 was observed for all the bimetallic catalysts except pd pt α al2o3 these findings suggest that metal catalysts can be tailored to achieve selective control over preferential degradation pathways and minimize the formation of undesired intermediates in the case of fluoxetine the reductive cleavage of co bond preceded ring hydrogenation and defluorination as shown in fig 3 c while pd α al2o3 exhibited high activity for the cleavage of co bond resulting in the rapid accumulation of nmpa only a negligible amount of cnma was detected fig 5 a suggesting that pd cannot effectively hydrogenate nmpa into cnma on the contrary rh α al2o3 completely hydrogenated nmpa into cnma within 60 min indicating that the rh based catalyst is capable of both co cleavage and ring hydrogenation in the case of bimetallic catalysts hydrogenation of nmpa to cnma was observed with all catalysts except pd pt α al2o3 fig 5 b considering almost no reactivity of the pt α al2o3 and ru α al2o3 catalysts toward co bond cleavage a remarkable increase in kobs for fluoxetine decomposition by pt ru α al2o3 2 48 0 12 l min gcat was observed time profiles of nmpa and cnma for all monometallic and bimetallic catalysts are also shown in fig a 15 concurrently the intermediate tfmp underwent reductive degradation as shown in figs 5 and a 16 in the case of the pd α al2o3 catalyst the degradation of tfmp observed over 120 min 40 closely matches with the defluorination of 41 2 1 9 fig 5 c suggesting complete defluorination of the trifluoromethyl group on tfmp to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that hydrodefluorination of perfluoroalkyl i e trifluoromethyl group via metal catalyst using h2 as reductant has been reported in the case of rh α al2o3 the observed degradation of tfmp 74 does not match with the defluorination of 41 1 9 suggesting only partial defluorination of tfmp fig 5 c while bimetallic catalysts such as rh pt rh pd and ru rh showed enhanced tfmp degradation efficiency compared with that of monometallic catalysts there was no observable enhancement in defluorination fig a 9 hence the reaction mixtures of fluoxetine and tfmp as a starting compound reduction by pd pd pt and rh pt were analyzed via gc ms fig a 13 it was found that the main fragments of p cresol i e m z 51 77 79 107 and 108 were identified in tfmp reduction by pd α al2o3 indicating that tfmp was transformed into p cresol by the replacement of three f atoms with h fig a 17 we additionally observed the appearance of three peaks which were assigned to m z values of 166 168 i and 168 ii in the case of rh pt α al2o3 fig a 13 the peaks at m z 166 and m z 168 could be 4 trifluoromethyl cyclohex 2 en 1 ol and 4 trifluoromethyl cyclohexan 1 ol respectively in contrast those peaks were not detected for pd α al2o3 and pd pt α al2o3 the results suggest that while pd α al2o3 and pd pt α al2o3 mainly catalyze defluorination pathway for tfmp reduction rh pt α al2o3 can catalyze both defluorination and hydrogenation of tfmp while hydrodefluorination of fluorinated organics using h2 as electron donor should lower ph according to the following equation 3 r f h 2 r h f h the ph change observed during the reaction was 0 5 for all reactions this may be due to functional moieties in fluorinated pharmaceuticals and their transformed products serving as a buffer and or degradation pathways other than hydrodefluorination results in ph increase overall the results of the catalytic degradation of levofloxacin sitagliptin and fluoxetine by mono and bi metallic catalysts showed that different monometallic and bimetallic catalysts show not only result in different reaction rates but also different reduction pathways for example rh based and ru pt catalysts can catalyze the defluorination of fluoroaromatics as well as hydrogenation of benzene rings while pd and pd pt catalysts have more selective preference for the defluorination of trifluoromethyl groups both pd based and rh based catalysts can catalyze the reductive cleavage of co bond from phenyl ether these different degradation mechanisms of fluorinated pharmaceuticals by different catalysts are summarized in table a 2 in appendix a 3 4 influence of reductive transformation of fluorinated pharmaceuticals on their toxicity to investigate the toxicity changes during the reductive transformation of fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds the lc50 and ec50 values of levofloxacin sitagliptin fluoxetine and their identified transformation products to different species i e d magna fish green algae mysid were predicted using the ecosar program as shown in table 2 in the case of all three fluorinated pharmaceuticals the defluorinated intermediates showed increased lc50 values compared with those of the parent compound for example 9 desfluorolovofloxacin has a d magna lc50 of 2 25 103 mg l which is slightly higher than that of levofloxacin 1 79 103 mg l similarly the successive defluorination of sitagliptin to the intermediates tp390 tp372 and tp354 slightly reduced the toxicity of the pharmaceutical compound whereby the l50 values of sitagliptin tp390 tp372 and tp354 for d magna were 21 9 27 6 34 9 and 43 9 mg l respectively most of the other intermediates too showed higher lc50 values than that of the parent compound with the exception of tp360 which showed approximately three times more acute toxicity than sitagliptin fluoxetine degradation products also showed lower toxicity than their parent compound lc50 values of fluoxetine nmpa and tfmp for d magna were 0 175 1 66 and 5 59 mg l respectively when tfmp is defluorinated to p cresol its lc50 value also slightly increased to 5 96 mg l however hydrogenation of nmpa to cmpa increased its toxicity i e lc50 of 0 397 mg l similar trends were also observed with lc50 and ec50 values for other species i e fish green algae and mysid toxicity prediction using ecosar program suggested that defluorination of three fluorinated pharmaceuticals compounds generally lowered their toxicity while hydrogenation of intermediates can increase their toxicity however these trends may not be applicable to all fluorinated pharmaceuticals to experimentally evaluate the change in overall toxicity during the catalytic reduction of the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds the bioluminescence inhibition of a fischeri was quantified for the catalyst treated samples obtained at different reaction times as shown in fig 6 no significant change was observed in the bioluminescence inhibition of both levofloxacin and sitagliptin over their degradation as discussed in section 3 3 different patterns of intermediate formation were observed in the case of sitagliptin degradation with the pt α al2o3 rh pt α al2o3 and ru pt α al2o3 catalysts for example high tp390 and minimal tp360 formation were monitored for pt al2o3 whereas high tp360 and low tp390 tp372 and tp354 formation were observed for rh pt al2o3 fig a 14 while the ecosar predicted lc50 and ec50 values of tp360 were lower than those of sitagliptin these different patterns of intermediate formation using different catalysts did not seem to influence the bioluminescence inhibition of a fischeri fig 6 b in the case of fluoxetine toxicity change was monitored with pd α al2o3 and rh pt α al2o3 to investigate the effect of the different reaction pathways with both catalysts inhibition increased from 59 1 0 3 initially to 80 87 at 15 min fig 6 c thereafter the inhibition gradually decreased to 55 1 5 1 for rh pt α al2o3 but continued to increase to 93 8 0 3 for pd α al2o3 at 120 min both the catalysts had reduced more than 99 of fluoxetine at 15 min suggesting that the intermediates have higher toxicity than the parent compound the toxic intermediates were further transformed into less toxic compounds in the case of rh pt α al2o3 as discussed in section 3 3 tfmp and its defluorinated compounds for instance p cresol in addition to nmpa are the major transformation products identified when the pd catalyst is used while both hydrogenated and defluorinated intermediates of tmfp i e 4 trifluoromethyl cyclohex 2 en 1 ol and 4 trifluoromethyl cyclohexan 1 ol in addition to cnma are the major products when the rh pt catalysts are used fig 5 interestingly ecosar predicted that the ec50 value of fluoxetine was lower than those of all identified intermediate products table 2 which contradicts the spike observed at 15 min in our experimental results of the inhibition of luminescence of a fischeri the inconsistency between the lc50 and ec50 values of aquatic organisms as predicted by ecosar and the bioluminescent inhibition of a fischeri could be owing to several reasons first the toxicity values of the fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds and their intermediates differ between the aquatic organisms in the ecosar model and a fischeri owing to variations in their ability to metabolize the compounds tested second it is possible that the ecotoxicty prediction via chemical structure based ecosar model has limited accuracy for fluorinated pharmaceuticals and their intermediates carpinteiro et al 2017 third unidentified intermediates could have high toxicity governing the overall toxicity of the reaction mixture for instance kuang et al 2013 observed increased toxicity using a fischeri inhibition during the ozonation of trimethoprim although ecosar predicted lower toxicity for all the intermediates identified than that of trimethoprim kuang et al 2013 they speculated that ring opened secondary products such as aldehyde have high toxicity for the catalytic reduction of ring containing compounds would not lead to ring opening and thus we anticipate that the formation of secondary products would be minimal last the toxicity behavior of chemicals in mixture do not correspond to those of pure compounds altenburger et al 2003 further study is needed to carefully characterize and assess the reductive transformation products and their overall toxicity change not only for these three fluorinated compounds but also for other fluorinated pharmaceuticals compounds as well nonetheless our results suggest that the catalytic reduction of levofloxacin sitagliptin and fluoxetine by bimetallic rh pt alumina catalysts led to the degradation of the parent compounds without forming intermediates and products that are significantly more toxic 4 conclusion in this study the catalytic reduction of three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds levofloxacin sitagliptin and fluoxetine were investigated using monometallic and bimetallic catalysts of pt group noble metals i e ru rh pd pt under ambient temperature and pressure conditions catalytic degradation of all three compounds were observed with general reactivity following the order fluoxetine sitagliptin levofloxacin a single transformation product 9 desfluorolevofloxacin was observed in the reduction of levofloxacin while multiple intermediates were observed for sitagliptin and fluoxetine in the case of sitagliptin the successive defluorination of the trifluorophenyl group led to the formation of three intermediates i e tp390 tp372 tp354 while the trifluoromethyl group was intact furthermore some catalysts further reduced tp354 to tp360 via hydrogenation of benzene ring in the case of fluoxetine the rapid degradation of the parent compound via co bond cleavage resulted in the formation of nmpa and tfmp followed by subsequent hydrogenation of these intermediates in this study three different degradation mechanisms hydrodefluorination of c f bond to ch bond hydrogenation of aromatic ring and reductive cleavage of co bond from phenyl ether were observed in which the type of catalyst metal influenced the preference for specific reduction pathways toxicity assessment using a fischeri showed there were no significant changes in toxicity over the catalytic reduction of levofloxacin and sitagliptin regardless of the formation of different intermediates in the case of fluoxetine enhanced toxicity was observed during catalytic reduction using monometallic pd α al2o3 suggesting the importance of degradation pathways and choice of catalyst metals to be used differences between the experimental results and the acute toxicity values predicted using the ecosar program were observed overall catalytic reduction efficiently degraded the three fluorinated pharmaceutical compounds levofloxacin sitagliptin and fluoxetine however the potential hazards of the catalytic reduction of fluorinated pharmaceuticals merits further evaluation furthermore there needs a continuous research to systematically elucidate the fate and transformation of fluorinated pharmaceuticals and their toxicological impacts over reductive and oxidative processes to ensure the safety of humans and the environment from these emerging contaminants
