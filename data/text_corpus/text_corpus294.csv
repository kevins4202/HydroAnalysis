1470,this article presents the results of groundwater monitoring over a period of six years and the interpretation of these results by a reactive transport model following an in situ recovery isr test on the dulaan uul uranium deposit in mongolia an environmental monitoring survey was set up using 17 piezometers from which it has been possible to describe the changes in the water composition before during and after the isr test the water quality before the start of mining activities rendered it unfit for human consumption during and after the test a descent of the saline plume was observed resulting in a dilution of the injection solutions after a rapid decrease to ph 1 13 during the production phase of the isr test the ph stabilized at around 4 in the production area and 5 5 below the production cell one year after the end of the test uranium and radium were being naturally attenuated uranium returned to background concentrations 0 3 mg l after two years and the measured 226ra concentrations represent no more than 10 of the expected concentrations during production 75 bq l the modeling of the contaminants of concern mobility namely ph and concentrations of sulfate uranium and 226ra is based on several key complementary mechanisms density flow cation exchange with clay minerals and co precipitation of 226ra in the barite the modeling results show that the observed plume descent and sulfate dilution can only be predicted if consideration of a high density flow is included similarly the changes in ph and 226ra concentration are only correctly predicted when the cationic exchanges with the clays and the co precipitation reaction within the barite using the solid solution theory are integrated into the models finally the proper representation of the changes in water composition at the scale of the test requires the use of a sufficiently fine mesh 1 m 1 m cell to take into account the spatial variability of hydrogeological permeability distribution in particular and geological reduced oxidized and mineralized facies distributions parameters graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords in situ recovery uranium 226ra natural attenuation reactive transport modeling 1 introduction world uranium production is now mainly accomplished by in situ recovery isr with 29 492 tons produced in 2017 or nearly 50 of world production wna 2018 this mining technique the first evidence of which dates back to roman antiquity is also used to extract evaporites potash natron and halite in addition to uranium isr is also used for other metals such as copper and gold kuhar et al 2018 martens et al 2012 seredkin et al 2016 sinclair and thompson 2015 this mining method consists of dissolving the uranium contained in permeable mainly sandstone geological formations in situ using leaching solutions the solubilized ore is then pumped to the surface and the uranium extracted iaea 2001 the leaching solution is then re injected into the well system after its properties have been renewed the leaching solutions used for uranium production by isr are of two types alkaline and acidic the other possibility is acid leaching most often sulphuric as practiced since the 1960s in countries of eastern europe central europe and central asia kazakhstan uzbekistan russia ukraine bulgaria czech republic but also in china and australia iaea 2016 märten 2006 compared to more traditional mining methods isr has attractive investment costs due to the absence of ore extraction and mechanical processing isr also has low operating costs that make it possible to bring low or very low grade deposits in the order of 100 ppm of uranium into production seredkin et al 2016 the deposits targeted for isr extraction are mainly roll front fig s1 supplementary information these are epigenetic concentrations of uranium within the terrigenous sedimentary series in intermountain and epicontinental basins dahlkamp 2010 mineralized orebodies are found within permeable sandy layers with several superimposed mineralized layers generally present in the same basin sometimes several hundred meters thick mineralization corresponds to the presence of a redox front separating a reduced downstream area rich in organic matter and often sulphides and an upstream area where the sediments appear leached and or oxidized since uranium is insoluble under reducing conditions it precipitates in contact with the reducing zone in the form of uraninite and coffinite woldegabriel et al 2014 zammit et al 2014 unlike many other types of uranium deposits roll front deposits are low grade whilst also often having considerable tonnage and extension at depths that can reach several hundred meters another necessary condition for isr extraction is the confinement of the mineralized reservoir generally by low permeability clay screens thus isolating the exploited reservoir from other adjacent aquifers it is the mine operator s responsibility to monitor the hydraulic balance between the injection and the production wells in order to limit the risks of a potential spread of leaching solutions outside the mine s boundary jeuken et al 2007 these processes had not been verified in the case of the stráž mine in the czechoslovak republic resulting in significant pollution of an aquifer dedicated to drinking water supply smetana et al 2002 reactive transport models are increasingly developed to optimize the operational recovery parameters such as injection flow rates and the ph of the injection solution by taking into account the heterogeneity of the geological formation being mined see for example bonnaud et al 2015 johnson and tutu 2016 lagneau et al 2019 regnault et al 2015 however these studies are often not published for confidentiality reasons see for example martens et al 2012 simon et al 2014 staub et al 1986 woods and jeuken 2015 isr mining is considered to result in a limited environmental impact on the surface compared to other mining techniques in addition no mill tailings is generated ballini et al 2020 chautard et al 2020 déjeant et al 2016 the main environmental impacts associated to isr mining are related to water quality in the mineralized aquifer and the risk of contaminating adjacent aquifers mudd 2001a 2001b saunders et al 2016 this last point is often questioned by stakeholders acting for the societal and environmental acceptance of mines operated by isr this is partly due to the limited data available to date in the scientific literature particularly regarding the environmental impact of acid isr exploitation knowledge on this topic had just started to emerge clay 2015 the initial water quality of uranium mineralized aquifers is generally poor with high natural levels of metals and radioelements 238u and its descendants but also salinity levels of up to several g l they are unsuitable for human consumption ariunbileg et al 2016 and belong to a class for industrial or technical use isr extraction generates a saline plume in the mining zones following the injection of the leaching solutions and the chemical reactions with the mineralized host dissolution precipitation sorption the criteria for the remediation of mineralized aquifers exploited using isr depend on the legislation of the countries where the mines are located however it is possible to identify a general consensus that is to return to a physicochemical water quality comparable to that observed before mining the definition of water quality may vary from one country to another for example it may be required to return it to a strictly identical state in terms of chemical composition or instead to verify a range of concentrations which will maintain the initial class of the aquifer being mined this illustrates the importance of establishing the initial hydrogeochemical background levels by taking into account the spatial variability in the chemical composition of the water inherent in the geochemistry of the mineralized aquifer for example we can distinguish between the hydraulic upstream part of the deposit characterized by oxidizing conditions and the mineralized and the hydraulic downstream zones both characterized by reducing conditions and highly variable dissolved uranium contents in the case of acid isr mining it is possible to distinguish several contaminants and physicochemical parameters of interest ph linked to the acidification of the mineralized zone so4 ions also linked to the acidification of the extraction zone use of sulphuric acid dissolved residual uranium 226ra from the dissolution of the ore as well as other radioactive descendants of uranium and finally other metals and cations solubilized by the acidification and oxidation of the mined mineralized zone three main approaches to the remediation of aquifers mined by isr currently stand out 1 the implementation of regular environmental monitoring and modeling to assess the natural attenuation potential of the mined reservoir 2 enhanced natural attenuation notably via biostimulation and 3 pump and treat natural attenuation is based partly on the geochemical ability of the geological host to buffer the chemical disturbance associated with the injection of the oxidizing solution and partly on the natural dilution of the salt plume generated during mining this remediation strategy has been used beyond the single context of acid isr see christensen et al 2004 jørgensen et al 2010 natural attenuation has a clear economic advantage since this solution is accompanied simply by environmental monitoring with if required predictive geochemical modeling davis and curtis 2007 jeuken et al 2009 the durations involved are longer than for pump and treat and bioremediation solutions but can be reduced in the case of assisted natural attenuation as proposed by park et al 2007 as a result the remediation of isr sites by natural attenuation remains poorly documented although some examples are available in the scientific literature bakarzhiyev et al 2004 dong et al 2016 fyodorov 2002 iaea 2005 yazikov and zabaznov 2002 enhanced natural attenuation is one of the alternative aquifer remediation strategies that have been developed initially and mainly outside the isr context the solutions developed are mainly based on immobilizing the contaminants within the aquifer by optimizing the physicochemical conditions of the host environment it is interesting to note the development in recent years of so called biostimulation solutions resulting in particular from work carried out on the treatment of polluted soils biostimulation aims to bio catalyse the chemical reactions necessary to achieve the remediation objectives jemison et al 2020 long et al 2008 these solutions have sometimes gone beyond the simple experimental stage and have been applied on an industrial scale notably for certain organic compounds in the case of uranium several industrial biostimulation tests have recently been carried out see for example groudev et al 2008 2010 long et al 2015 in the more specific context of isr operations biostimulation work is currently underway both at alkaline sites hall 2009 wu et al 2006a 2006b yabusaki et al 2007 2014 and acid sites coral et al 2018 descostes et al 2014 finally pump and treat has been widely deployed in the united states in the context of alkaline isr operations it focuses mainly on water treatment where appropriate in several stages iaea 2001 2005 i pumping out the contaminated water after the end of mining operations the leached area is thus in contact with the uncontaminated aquifer ii treating the contaminated water on the surface usually by reverse osmosis and then re injecting it into the leached area iii if necessary adding a chemical reducer e g h2s or na2s in situ or ex situ to promote the precipitation of insoluble metals under reducing conditions iv pumping out the injected water again and then re injecting it to enhance the mixing phase in view of the feedback from experience gained mainly under alkaline isr operating conditions it is now considered that this expensive solution does not necessarily meet the initial objectives of remediation hall 2009 yabusaki et al 2014 indeed the sensu stricto treatment of water does not take into consideration the stock of contaminants of interest in their entirety plaue and czerwinski 2002 thus the contaminants of interest may be immobilized within the aquifer either as neoformed minerals or sorbed onto the surfaces of the aquifer s host minerals mainly of clay dangelmayr et al 2018 johnson and tutu 2016 robin et al 2015b 2017 2020 the gradual return of the natural hydraulic gradient leads to chemical reactions between the uncontaminated groundwater and the solid fraction of the leachate zone which will tend to remobilize the adsorbed contaminants anastasi and williams 1984 also even if the water from the leached area is treated in the short term a remobilization of contaminants can be observed in the longer term when the equilibrium conditions of the leached area are modified by the return of uncontaminated water see examples given in hall 2009 in order to assess the best solution for the remediation of mineralized aquifers mined by acid isr several complementary approaches are available in particular 1 observations at mine sites operated by acid isr 2 laboratory tests 3 the establishment of pilot sites 4 geochemical modeling recent exploration work carried out by cogegobi llc a subsidiary of the orano group has led to the discovery of two major roll front uranium deposits in the tsagaan els basin of mongolia dulaan uul and zuuvch ovoo cardon et al 2015 grizard et al 2019 these deposits are currently the subject of feasibility studies for in situ acid leaching and it is in this context that an isr test has been carried out at the dulaan uul deposit the pilot site of dulaan uul can be considered for modelers as a relevant work tool this site equipped with numerous environmental monitoring piezometers 17 made it possible to monitor the post operations natural attenuation from december 2010 to may 2017 with the benefit of a comprehensive set of data broad sampling both spatially and temporally the dulaan uul site is therefore a high quality calibration point for environmental monitoring models which aim to propose an environmental remediation scenario solely by natural attenuation or coupled with reprocessing bioremediation adapted to the local geochemistry this article presents the results of the environmental monitoring of the isr test carried out at the dulaan uul deposit over a six year period as well as the geochemical modeling of the behaviour of the various contaminants of interest which are ph so4 ions and also uranium and 226ra this work makes it possible to understand the nature of the impact caused by acid isr exploitation and to develop reactive transport models focused on the chemical changes during and after the isr test based on water quality monitoring and available mineralogical and hydrogeological data as a result this work helps to identify the key geochemical mechanisms and the degree of precision of their consideration to correctly represent these changes both during the test phase and during environmental monitoring after the test has been completed ultimately the operator will have access to a tool and to some key information that will enable him to choose the appropriate remediation method based on the legislative and environmental constraints of the site being operated 2 presentation of the dulaan uul deposit and the associated isr test 2 1 description of the dulaan uul deposit the dulaan uul deposit is located in southeast mongolia 500 km from ulaan baatar in the southern part of the dornogobi aïmag province see fig s2 supplementary information this is a roll front deposit with an average grade of 150 ppmu and 6500 tu of resources cardon et al 2015 le goux et al 2015 located at a depth of 40 160 m the reader is referred to the studies of graham et al 2001 johnson 2004 and prost 2004 for a detailed geological description of the region the deposit is located within the unegt sedimentary sub basin which together with the zuunbayan sub basin constitutes the tsagaan els basin the bedrock of the area s formations consists of land dating from the paleozoic to the triassic a first phase of rifting created fault troughs and caused the opening of small basins including the one at unegt this period of sustained volcanism and expansion thinned the continental lithosphere and prepared for an uplift of the mantle which had become hotter an intensive abrasion phase then followed the rifting phase and eroded the relief the whole area was then molded by a fluvial to fluviolacustrine continental sedimentation zuunbayan formation lower cretaceous on which the sainshand sediments began to randomly settle late lower cretaceous the sainshand river series are characterized by very large lateral variations in facies between the main axes of the channels coarse facies conglomerates sands silts and the flood plains fine to very fine facies clays and paleosols two formations of equivalent thickness k2ss1 and k2ss2 were identified in the sainshand grizard et al 2019 k2ss2 formation is the host formation of the uranium mineralizations uranium rich oxidized waters from granitic formations would have circulated through a drainage system to form the roll fronts observed in k2ss2 the environment of the mineralization deposit is that of an interlinked hydrographic system that gradually changed to a meandering river system where floodplains developed and sandy areas diminished the chain of events of several of these sequences river system and floodplains would be at the origin of the k2ss2 formation and its four lithological units u1 to u4 the mineralizations are well developed and continuous in the upper part of the u2 unit between 106 and 117 m deep in the area of umnut isr test they extend transversely over 200 m with a thickness that varies from 5 to 23 m the presence of clay screens delimiting the u2 stratigraphic unit and the medium to coarse sandy facies of this unit are conducive to an in situ leaching test three main geochemical facies are found on the deposit an oxidized facies corresponding to the hydraulic upstream part of the deposit a reduced facies corresponding to the hydraulic downstream part of the deposit and finally a mineralized reduced facies corresponding to mineralization at the interface of the oxidized and reduced zones cf fig 1 2 2 petrography and mineralogy the summarized elements of petrography and mineralogy are provided here the reader should refer to angileri et al 2020 cardon et al 2015 and robin et al 2020 for a more detailed description but also to the work on the zuuvch ovoo deposit which has strong similarities pons 2015 rallakis et al 2018 these are medium to coarse sands rich in lithic elements mainly quartz and alkaline feldspar albite and orthosis characteristic of detrital elements that have been transported over a short distance some grains have fractures cracks corresponding to dissolution and recrystallization patterns they are evidence of a strong hydrothermal alteration temperatures 200 c which occurred before erosion and transport of the detrital minerals some partial replacements of the mineral by silicates of the chlorite mica biotite epidote and sometimes pyrite types are thus observed among the accessory minerals present in the mineral array of the lithic elements magmatic minerals apatite ilmenite fe or ti oxides zircon and monazite and hydrothermal minerals epidote barite and pyrite are observed the matrix of these sands is clayey in nature and is located around the grains it is mainly composed of smectite of the montmorillonite type and of kaolinite as well as framboidal pyrite of diagenetic origin robin et al 2020 some carbonate mineral occurrences are also found but the content remains low 1 on the redox front zone and within the reduced zone the uranium phases appear late the mineralizations show clearly visible uraninite minerals of very pure composition frequently with 80 to 85 uranium oxide they are often associated with carbonaceous materials lignite type or as a partial replacement for iron and titanium oxides angileri et al 2020 in the area being studied the main characteristics of the ore are 1 an average uranium content of 200 ppm 2 a low carbonate content of about 0 66 3 an average rock density of 1 6 and 4 a fairly coarse grain size as previously mentioned smectite 3 10 w and barite 340 1000 ppm are known to be present these minerals play a key role in regulating water chemistry most notably in the natural attenuation mechanisms indeed smectite due to its cation exchange properties robin et al 2015a 2015b 2017 will play a leading role in the behaviour of u 226ra and also ph barite on the other hand is a trap for 226ra by co precipitation curti et al 2010 these initially present minerals are also observed after leaching angileri et al 2020 as was also observed in a similar isr context in kazakhstan robin et al 2015a 2015b the mineralogical paragenesis considered for geochemical modeling is defined below 2 3 hydrogeology the unegt basin is endorheic with captive to semi captive groundwater grizard et al 2019 k2ss2 appears as a multilayer aquifer composed of four sandy units u1 to u4 separated by impermeable clayed layers the flow is from west to east similar to surface flow with a regional hydraulic gradient limited by the endorheic character estimated at 0 13 within u2 unit at the scale of the deposit of dulaan uul the u2 unit is considered to be a confined aquifer in coarse sand with high porosity and permeability its main hydrogeological characteristics are presented in table s1 in supplementary information 2 4 regional water geochemistry the uranium fronts in the dulaan uul area are considered as fossils mineralization uranium and related metals is remobilized by the aquifer flows the water of the unegt basin and that of the u2 unit in particular must be considered unfit for human consumption ariunbileg et al 2016 it is of the sodium chloride chemical type with an accessory component of sulfate its ph is moderately alkaline 7 6 to 8 6 conductivity is high 1500 to 3600 μs cm indicating water with a high dissolved content the uranium concentrations are naturally high with values up to 0 48 mg l throughout the central zone of the basin there are also concentrations of certain metals iron manganese molybdenum selenium arsenic that exceed the permissible standard levels the spatial variability of the hydrochemistry linked to the presence of the uranium roll front complicates the monitoring of the exploited aquifers it is difficult to define a single local baseline see for instance ariunbileg et al 2016 the modeling therefore requires the definition of three types of water rock equilibria oxidized mineralized reduced in their initial state these will be detailed in the next section 2 5 water geochemistry on the scale of the isr test the chemical composition of the water was monitored on a dedicated network of piezometers in the area of the isr test see fig 1 no marked zonation of the major elements is observed see table s3 in supplementary information the water is moderately alkaline of the sodium chloride type with a minor sulfate component as expected the zonation is significantly more pronounced for elements sensitive to oxidation reduction conditions fe as se and u the average u concentrations vary from 0 04 mg l or 1 7 10 7 mol l in the oxidized zone to 0 26 mg l or 1 1 10 6 mol l in the mineralized zone and 0 01 mg l or 4 9 10 8 mol l in the reduced zone the same behaviour is observed for fe 1 6 10 3 mmol l in the upstream oxidized zone 2 0 10 3 mmol l in the mineralized zone and 7 2 10 4 mmol l in the reduced zone as 1 8 10 5 mmol l in the upstream oxidized zone 2 2 10 5 mmol l in the mineralized zone and 1 2 10 5 mmol l in the reduced zone and se 4 7 10 5 mmol l in the upstream oxidized zone 1 2 10 4 mmol l in the mineralized zone and 7 5 10 6 mmol l in the reduced zone from the point of view of both mongolian mongolian national standard 2005 and international world health organization 2017 drinking water standards the water quality is unfit for consumption particularly with regard to its salinity concentration of uranium u mns 2005 0 015 mg l u who 2017 0 03 mg l fluorine chlorine sulfate but also sodium magnesium manganese radium 226 226ra mns 2005 n a 226ra who 2017 1 bq l arsenic and selenium 2 6 description of the isr test and monitoring network the in situ acid leaching test was conducted in the umnut southwest mineralized area from december 1 2010 to june 20 2011 over a period of 201 days during the test period 212 9 t of sulphuric acid were injected into cell 1 with an average ph of injection solutions of about 1 2 2879 kg of uranium were extracted monitoring of the aquifer continues to this day sampling was performed following the best quality standards for groundwaters piezometer aqueous volume replaced at least 3 times physico chemical parameters stabilization filtration and conditioning acidification were achieved right after the sampling on the field to prevent any oxidation and subsequent precipitation among the many chemical elements measured we can mention those presented in this study namely ph aqueous concentrations of calcium magnesium sodium potassium sulfates uranium and 226ra verification of the charge balance of the solutions allows to regard the entire dataset used in this study as consistent conductivity was not measured during test operations therefore in order to monitor the changes in the salt plume generated by the injection of sulphuric acid the sulfate concentration data were used instead of conductivity data see fig s3 in supplementary information the injection of sulphuric acid led to a drastic increase in concentrations of sulfate ions and protons sulfate ions therefore constituted the major anion and could as a first approximation be considered as non reactive with the host in contrast with the protons aquifer monitoring is carried out using 17 piezometers located in the isr test area and in the lower u1 isrz 0006 piezometer and upper u3 isrz 0007 piezometer aquifers see fig 1 as shown on the vertical section in fig 1 the screens of the environmental monitoring piezometers are located so as to provide information on the temporal and spatial changes in the salt plume generated by the isr test thus the piezometers isrz 0002 and isrz 0008 are located directly below the production cell the screens being positioned directly above a clay layer onto which the salt plume sinks the isrz 0010 piezometer is configured in the same way but 10 m downstream so as to assess the lateral extension of the plume over time finally other piezometers are located further from the production cells and were screened over a greater height isrz 0001 50 m upstream 39 m screened isrz 0005 50 m downstream 39 m screened in order to monitor water quality at the aquifer scale 3 materials and methods 3 1 modeling tools the reactive transport modeling was carried out using hytec v 4 2 software coupling the chess geochemistry code v3 9 release 1 patchlevel 2 to an r2d2 fluid transport model lagneau and van der lee 2010 van der lee et al 2003 hytec is based on an operator splitting algorithm sequential iterative scheme for coupling between transport and chemistry flow and transport are solved using finite volume based on a voronoi or regular grid in 1 to 3d with a one step centered crank nicholson time discretization chemistry resolution is based on the primary component or basis species approach lichtner 1996 with mixed thermodynamically or kinetically controlled reactions the resulting algebra differential system of equations is solved using an analytical formulation of the jacobian the calculations were run on 24 cpus the thermodynamic database used was that of the lawrence livermore national laboratory e q3 6 version 8 it was completed by the sorption exchange constants of the major cations h na na k ca2 mg2 and traces 226ra u vi on the kaolinite and montmorillonite according to a multi site formalism presented in reinoso maset and ly 2016 2014 the gravity flows induced by the density difference between the leaching solution and the aquifer water were taken into account by considering the differences in salinity baxter and wallace 1916 guo and langevin 2002 the post processing of the results was performed using paraview v5 0 0 ahrens et al 2005 ayachit 2015 in the case of 226ra post processing was performed using excel see dedicated section the spatial and temporal changes in water chemistry were modeled on the basis of the environmental monitoring from the beginning of the isr test to 2145 days later i e over nearly six years 3 2 construction of the model due to the difference in density between the leaching solution density 1 022 and the aquifer water density 1 001 a density flow was observed during the test vertical 2d modeling was therefore preferred over horizontal 2d modeling in order to correctly represent this phenomenon with the objective of analyzing one cell only it was decided to model the south west north east axis the production cell is represented by an injection well extraction well injection well axis with an injection well extraction well separation of 15 m the east west regional flow was assessed using the conditions at the cell boundaries with a value of 2 m year grizard 2017 it was considered negligible during the modeling period the mineralized zone was modeled as a homogeneous zone with an average u grade of 200 ppm fig 2 this simplifying hypothesis may generate some differences in intensity over short time intervals in the modeling but does not undermine the geochemical trends observed the distribution of permeable sand and impermeable clay zones was simplified in order to keep only the clay interlayers that have an impact on the salt plume flow i e with a lateral continuity of several meters and measuring more than 50 cm thick the modeling results are presented mainly for the piezometers where variations in chemical composition were visible namely isrp 0001 the extraction well screened over 11 m located in the mineralized zone isrz 0008 located below the cell to monitor plume plunging this piezometer is screened over two zones of 6 m separated by 9 m un screened and is located in the reduced zone isrz 0010 located 10 m downstream from the cell at a lower level in order to follow the plume downstream from the test it is screened over 17 m and is in the reduced zone isrz 0013 located below the cell the 6 m screen is positioned directly above the clay base to monitor the arrival of the salt plume and is in the reduced zone isrz 0005 located 50 m downstream and screened over a height of 39 m this piezometer did not show any effect and due to the considerable size of the screen can be taken as the most representative of the quality of the non exploited groundwater it is mainly in a reduced area but intercepts a flank of the mineralized zone over 6 m the modeling mesh used in this study consists of 78 000 cells measuring 1 m 1 m over a 600 m 130 m area it modeled the test and its impact to date and allowed the model to be validated on the measurements p1 extraction well and monitoring piezometers a second mesh consisting of 4950 cells measuring 4 m 4 m over an identical area was also tested to assess the sensitivity of this parameter to the results 3 3 construction of the geochemical model simulating the impact of the isr test on aquifer waters requires the prior construction of a geochemical model describing the porous medium studied this model is based on the determination of a combination of minerals compatible with the mineralogical observations angileri et al 2020 le goux et al 2015 pons 2015 robin et al 2020 which are considered to be in equilibrium with the interstitial waters by respecting the three zones of interest delineated by the redox front the oxidized mineralized and reduced zones the calculations are also based on the cation exchange properties of clay minerals here mainly smectite robin et al 2015b 2020 see note 1 in supplementary information the total exchange capacity of the rock is set to 1 36 meq 100 g according to the content of smectite and kaolinite and their respective exchange capacities the total porosity considered for the model is 27 the proportions of minerals constituting the reactive paragenesis were chosen so as to respect the available thin section and total rock analyses the main differences between the reduced oxidized and mineralized zones concern the calcite and uraninite contents see table s4 in supplementary information for reasons of numerical convergence the pyrite was removed from the system by imposing the oxidation reduction potential in the reduced zones mineralized 200 mv she reduced 220 mv she resulting in an underestimation of the redox buffer capacities of the aquifer reimus et al 2019 in relation to the metals the latter being insoluble under reducing conditions but mobile under oxidizing conditions the modeled results were therefore increased the clay minerals were represented by montmorillonite 85 and kaolinite 15 with a total clay mineral content of 5 7 finally kinetic constants were used for kaolinite alpha cristobalite uraninite microcline montmorillonite goethite and barite giammar 2001 palandri and kharaka 2004 robin et al 2015b the injection solutions were modeled in two phases 1 an initial phase with a ph of about 1 06 injected during the first 20 days of the test operation and 2 a recirculation phase between t 21 days and the end of the test where the solutions pumped into the extraction wells were reinjected into the injection wells once the uranium had been extracted the ph being about 1 24 the complete composition of these two solutions is available in table s5 supplementary information 3 4 226ra modeling at the extraction well level the source term of 226ra was modeled by 1 its incorporation into the 238u decay phase a ratio for 238u 226ra of 2 was assumed for this in accordance with the average age of the mineralizations between 0 3 and 0 5 my and 2 by cationic exchanges with the clay minerals present reinoso maset and ly 2014 2016 robin et al 2017 co precipitation within barite curti et al 2010 was not included in the hytec version used for this study so this mechanism was not taken into account in representing the source term of 226ra and has therefore been disregarded 226ra is therefore distributed as 99 97 inside the uraninite and 0 03 sorbed onto clay minerals via cation exchange however to represent the mobility of 226ra in the system after acidification it is necessary to consider the cation exchange properties with the clay minerals as well as the co precipitation within the barite the mineralogical observations as well as the saturation indices for this mineralogical phase calculated from the environmental monitoring data the calculated saturation index varies between 0 33 and 3 02 with an average of 1 01 indicate its occurrence and stability throughout the isr test angileri et al 2020 robin et al 2020 co precipitation was considered retrospectively after the hytec calculations by using a constant 226 radium aqueous solid repartition coefficient k 0 07824 this coefficient was obtained using the chess software thermodynamic calculation part of hytec through batch calculations which integrated the solid solution theory based on a thermodynamic database relating to the solid solution between the raso4 and baso4 poles curti et al 2010 in an isr context i e using aqueous barium concentration of 0 5 μmol l and aqueous sulfate concentration of 0 4 mol l with this input concentration barite is oversaturated and is expected to precipitate the distribution of radium between the aqueous phase and the barite was calculated for different radium concentration values in water and shows a constant 226 radium aqueous solid repartition coefficient see table s6 supplementary information the calculations presented were made only for the extraction well isrp 0001 in order to avoid the effects of gravity flows present for the other piezometers this calculation is divided into two phases 1 the release of

at the level of the extraction well isrp 0001 226ra co precipitation within the barite is taken into account via a calculation at each time interval which consists of three stages see fig s4

modeled using hytec at time t 213 days corresponding to the maximum observed conductivity the first step 2d calculation over time was modeled using hytec during this calculation the saturation index of the barite was calculated to verify its stability in this modeling the radium was divided between the sorbed via cation exchange and the aqueous stocks the 226ra concentration as a function of time was extracted from the modeling at the isrp 0001 extraction well via the paraview interface the second step calculation at the level of the extraction well was performed using excel figure s4 supplementary information clearly shows the changes in the 226ra concentration over the calculation steps the initial concentration calculated using hytec is higher because it does not consider co precipitation the co precipitation with barite 2 i improves the model especially for the peak production of 226ra but does not correctly represent the long term changes when the initial equilibrium with barite is considered 2 ii the modeling of the long term changes in 226ra concentrations is closer to the measured values but it is necessary to correct these values from the gravitational effect 2 iii which generates a long term curve very close to the measured values 4 monitoring results changes in the saline plume and evidence of natural attenuation in this section only the wells which showed significant variations in the measurements are presented namely the extraction well isrp 0001 as well as the piezometers isrz 0008 isrz 0010 and isrz 0013 for comparison the results of the isrz 0005 piezometer which was not affected are also presented no variation in concentration was noted upstream or downstream of the test area and in the overlying and underlying aquifers 4 1 sulfate ions a good tracer of the salt plume as seen above sulfate ions were used to trace the salt plume because the conductivity was not be measured at all points the sulfate concentration outside the isr test was 3 6 10 3 mol l during the test concentrations of 0 15 mol l and then 0 2 mol l were injected at the level of the extraction well the arrival of sulfate ions was relatively rapid from 20 days after the start after 60 days the sulfate concentration stabilized at around 0 15 mol l and eventually decreased rapidly after the end of the test t 200 days during the last three years of monitoring t 3 years to t 6 years the concentrations were stable and in the order of 0 01 mol l seefig 3 1 at the bottom of the production cell the arrival of the salt plume was observed with a time delay of more than 300 days thus a concentration peak of 0 099 mol l is noticeable on the isrz 0008 monitoring well immediately below the cell at t 369 169 days after the end of the test the sulfate concentrations decreased more slowly than for the extraction well to 0 02 mol l the isrz 0013 piezometer located 55 m below the cell on the clay base detected the arrival of the salt plume after five years with a concentration of 7 6 10 3 mol l the plume was significantly attenuated due to its gravity flow descent and the induced dilution laterally an increase in sulfate concentrations was noticeable for the isrz 0010 piezometer located 10 m downstream of the cell the peak concentration was 0 05 mol l 80 days after the end of the test but in view of the piezometer having been put into operation on this date it is possible that the concentrations were higher before the concentrations gradually decreased and stabilized at around 5 10 3 mol l after 6 years less than twice the regional background level finally the piezometer located 50 m downstream isrz 0005 showed no increase in sulfate concentration during the six years of monitoring thus once the isr test was completed the observed sulfate concentrations were significantly reduced mainly due to the descent of the salt plume and its dilution thus leading to a limited impact on the sulfate ions restricted and constrained to the area just under the production cell and its close vicinity 10 m after six years of monitoring 4 2 specific ph behaviour before the isr test the average ph observed in the water was 7 7 the injection solutions were at ph levels of 1 1 for the first 20 days then 1 2 at the level of the extraction well the ph decreased rapidly starting at 20 days and stabilized at around 1 3 after the end of the test the ph rose and remained at around 4 which was observed up to the 6 year point see fig 3 2 under the production cell the isrz 0008 piezometer had stable ph values of around 5 5 as soon as it was installed at t 285 85 days after the end of the isr test further below isrz 0013 had a slightly lower ph starting from t 4 5 years the value observed at t 6 years was 7 5 positioned 10 m downstream the isrz 0010 piezometer had a ph of 5 4 at start up t 285 the latter rose to stabilize at 6 5 from t 2 5 years the piezometer located 50 m downstream isrz 0005 did not show any significant variation in ph over the six years of monitoring the stabilization of ph observed at the different levels depending on the location of the piezometers shows a particular behaviour of the protons in relation to the sulfates 4 3 behaviour of major cations as previously mentioned the water was of the sodium chloride type with a sulfate accessory component the geochemical background concentrations were respectively 1 9 10 2 mol l for na 7 10 4 mol l for ca and mg and 6 10 5 mol l for k a significant increase in concentrations was observed at the extraction well for these four cations na max 3 2 10 2 mol l at t 60 days mg max 2 1 10 2 mol l at t 90 days ca max 1 2 10 2 mol l at t 40 days k max 2 5 10 3 mol l at t 200 days followed by a decrease the return to background levels was observed for na from t 3 years see fig s5 3 supplementary information the other three elements showed a slow decrease in their concentrations in the water with concentrations at t 6 years of 2 10 3 mol l for ca see fig s5 1 supplementary information 2 3 10 3 mol l for mg and 1 3 10 4 mol l for k below the production cell as for the sulfate ions the isrz 0008 piezometer had a peak concentration just after the end of the test notably for mg mg max 3 0 10 2 mol l at t 310 days and na na max 3 7 10 2 mol l at t 285 days and to a lesser extent for ca ca max 1 4 10 2 mol l at t 285 days potassium on the other hand gradually increased to 1 6 10 3 mol l at t 3 years see fig s5 4 supplementary information while the return to background levels was observed for na from t 3 years the other three elements showed a slow decrease in their concentrations in water with concentrations at t 6 years of 6 2 10 3 mol l for ca 5 2 10 3 mol l for mg and 8 3 10 4 mol l for k at the base of the aquifer below the production cell the concentrations of the major cations increased slightly over the final year for na 2 5 10 2 mol l and mg 1 7 10 3 mol l indicating the gradual arrival of the salt plume onto the clay base already visible in the changes in the sulfate concentrations finally a lower peak concentration of major cations na max 2 7 10 2 mol l at t 370 days mg max 1 6 10 2 mol l at t 285 days ca max 8 9 10 3 mol l at t 285 days k max 3 6 10 4 mol l at t 370 days was observed laterally at the isrz 0010 structure located 10 m downstream from the production cell the return to background levels was observed for ca na and k magnesium had a residual concentration of 1 3 10 3 mol l at t 6 years see fig s5 2 supplementary information the increased concentrations of the major cations clearly show that sulphuric acid reacts with the host by releasing na ca mg and to a lesser extent k this point will be discussed later section 5 2 4 4 natural attenuation of uranium and 226ra uranium and radium both exhibit specific behaviours clearly illustrating the phenomenon of natural attenuation as a reminder the extraction well was located in the mineralized zone while all the other piezometers mentioned in this study were in the reduced zone in the mineralized zone the background level of 226ra was 2 7 bq l on average with uranium s being 1 1 10 6 mol l 3 2 bq l in the reduced zone it was 0 42 bq l for radium and 4 9 10 8 mol l 0 14 bq l for uranium only the extraction well isrp 0001 showed an increase in uranium concentrations uo2 max 4 10 4 mol l or 95 mg l at t 40 days seefig 4 1 during the test operation period at the end of two years unlike the major cations and sulfate ions the observed dissolved uranium concentrations were very low in the order of the background levels at the various sampling points thus as soon as the isr test was completed no impact was observed on the dissolved uranium for 226ra the extraction well isrp 0001 had an increase of two orders of magnitude to 75 bq l see fig 4 2 this peak was quickly absorbed by an order of magnitude and stabilized at around 10 bq l after 150 days of test operation the isrz 0008 and isrz 0010 piezometers had concentrations in the order of 1 to 2 bq l at the end of the test with an observed return to background levels about 1 year after the end of the test for isrz 0010 and 3 years after the end of the test for isrz 0008 finally isrz 0013 and isrz 0005 did not show a significant variation in 226ra concentration the measured values being of the order of the background levels 0 28 bq l on average for isrz 0005 and 0 088 bq l on average for isrz 0013 226ra and uranium are considered to have a disequilibrium of 2 in the ore which given that all the uraninite is dissolved at the level of the production area would imply dissolved uranium activities twice as large as those for radium however as shown in fig 4 3 226ra activity was lower than expected 75 bq l for 226ra compared to 1 175 bq l for uranium indicating that about 90 of the 226ra was immobilized between the time of dissolution and its arrival at the extraction well i e a maximum of 15 days the residence time of the injected solutions this result is in agreement with alpha autoradiography observations performed on thin sections of samples before and after the isr test angileri et al 2020 5 modeling and discussion in this section 1 the gravity flow to better represent the changes in water chemistry during and after the isr test 2 the cationic exchange reactions of clay minerals 3 the results of modeling the behaviour of the trace elements uranium and 226ra and 4 the appropriate balance between the cell size of the model and the representation of the observations made in the field are discussed 5 1 demonstration of the gravitational effect the modeled injection solutions had a tds total dissolved solid value equal to 16 21 g l for the first 20 days then 23 5 g l between t 21 days and the end of the test whereas before operations the water tds was 1 5 g l this difference results in a significant density contrast between the injected solutions and the aquifer which will involve a vertical dispersion driven by this density contrast models with and without density flow integration clearly show the need to consider the implications of this density contrast see fig 5 if the density flow effect is ignored the injected solutions remained in the production area as shown in the 2d sections of the sulfate concentrations modeled at t 200 days and t 6 years see fig 5 this is reflected in particular by the persistence of high modeled concentrations at the extraction well as illustrated by the changes in the sulfate ion concentration in the fig 5 concentration plateau at 0 198 mol l for 6 years against a rapid observed decrease to 9 6 10 3 mol l at t 6 years when the density flow effect is taken into account the concentrations of major cations also remain too high after the end of the test while the ph remains too low phwithout density flow 2 5 at t 6 years compared to phwith density flow 4 1 on the same date considering the density flow effect makes it possible to better represent the changes in sulfate ion concentrations both at the level of the extraction well see fig 5 and at environmental monitoring wells see fig 3 1 it should be noted that the isrz 0010 piezometer does not appear to capture the peak sulfate concentration and only records the decrease in concentrations which followed the piezometer was put into operation after the peak sulfate ion concentration had been reached thus the density contrast between the injected solution and the aquifer water has been sufficient to cause significant plunging of the salt plume after the end of operations as illustrated on the 2d sections of the sulfate concentrations modeled at t 200j and t 6 years in fig 5 the saline plume reaches the bottom of the reservoir approximately 7 months after the end of the isr test and then slowdowns this density flow effect contributes to the natural attenuation of the plume causing its dilution over the height of the exploited aquifer 5 2 importance of the cationic exchange reactions with clay minerals the migratory behaviour of trace elements such as uranium and 226ra is governed by the major elements through complexing reactions in solution co precipitation within the insoluble phases and cation exchange with clay minerals adsorption at the surface and also interlayer exchange in the case of smectite therefore it is necessary to ensure that the models allow the behaviour of the major cations ca mg na na k and protons through ph to be properly represented simulations with and without cation exchange reactions with clay minerals clearly show to what extent this mechanism controls the concentrations of major cations in water without cation exchange the water chemistry is governed only by the precipitation dissolution reactions of reactive paragenesis the main reactive minerals at the extraction well were uraninite 99 9 of the uraninite in place was dissolved at t 200 days 100 at t 6 years and calcite 100 of the calcite in place was dissolved at t 200 days in the non mineralized zone goethite was also reactive 6 of the goethite in place in the oxidized zone was dissolved at t 200 days 11 at t 6 years barite precipitated 396 at t 200 days 593 after 6 years allowing 226ra to co precipitate at the same time finally the concentrations of kaolinite montmorillonite ca cristobalite and microcline did not change during the six years of modeling the precipitation of secondary minerals was blocked their saturation indices showing systematically under saturation except for gypsum the issue of gypsum precipitation will be discussed at the end of this section these reactions effectively replicate the decrease in ph and the increase in major cation concentrations but not sufficiently to replicate the amplitudes observed in the monitoring data the ph decrease is relatively well represented regardless of whether the cation exchange mechanism ce with clay minerals is considered or not see fig 6 2 for the extraction well at the bottom of the curve ph without ce 1 33 ph with ce 1 35 phobserved 1 13 indicating that the major mechanism for controlling ph during the test is the dissolution of the reactive paragenesis including calcite dissolution however the shape of the ph curve once the test is completed can be seen to be very different depending on the mechanisms considered if sorption is disregarded the modeled ph rises rapidly above ph 6 at t 2 years and tend towards ph 7 at t 6 years while the monitoring data show a ph of around 4 that sets in from t 2 years and remains up to t 6 years in contrast the modeling which includes the cation exchange reactions does succeed in representing this ph at the level of the extraction well as well as the trends and amplitudes of the monitoring piezometers see fig 6 2 the slight discrepancies between the monitoring and the modeling data noted in the short term t 1 5 years for the isrz 0008 and isrz 0010 piezometers may most likely be explained by the simplification of the distribution of the permeable impermeable facies in addition the modeling of mg concentrations over time with consideration see fig s5 1 supplementary information and without consideration of the cationic exchange reactions see fig 6 2 shows the amplitude differences modeled without sorption the modeled magnesium concentration peaks were 9 10 3 mol l for isrp 0001 mg ref peak 2 1 10 2 mol l 8 5 10 3 mol l for isrz 0008 mg ref peak 3 0 10 2 mol l and 5 7 10 3 mol l for isrz 0010 mg ref peak 1 6 10 2 mol l respectively when sorption is considered these peaks are modeled at 2 1 10 2 mol l for isrp 0001 4 4 10 2 mol l for isrz 0008 and 3 5 10 2 mol l for isrz 0010 thus respecting both the magnitude and the trends of the environmental monitoring points the trends of the other major cations are respected but an amplitude problem arises ca concentrations are overestimated see fig s5 2 3 and 4 supplementary information due to the absence of gypsum precipitation no sulfate phase precipitation was observed on cored samples angileri et al 2020 this overestimation in solution results in a shift in the equilibrium of the sorbed cations which explains the discrepancies observed between modeling and observation gypsum precipitation could make it possible to better represent the changes in ca mg na and k concentrations particularly in terms of amplitude but does not allow the ph to be correctly modeled see fig s6 1 2 3 4 and 5 supplementary information which is a major limitation in the context of isr operations the main objective of these models is to correctly represent the behaviour of ph sulfate ions uranium and 226ra so it was decided not to allow gypsum to precipitate in the models despite the fact that the calcium and the sulfates in solution seem to be in equilibrium with the gypsum to illustrate the role of cation exchange with the clay minerals at the extraction well the distribution of the major cations and uranium between sorbed aqueous and solid phases is shown in fig s7 and s8 supplementary information these cations are initially distributed between the sorbed fraction 99 for the proton between 20 and 22 for ca mg and na 1 3 for k the aqueous phase 0 1 for ca mg h and k 79 for na and the solid phase between 78 and 99 of the total stock for ca mg k and h no solid phase for sodium and the protons uranium on the other hand is mainly in the solid phase 99 9 and in the water 0 1 as illustrated in fig s8 supplementary information the arrival of the salt and acid plume drives out the cations initially sorbed via cation exchange on clay minerals mainly ca and mg in favour of the protons see fig 7 at the end of the isr test there was no significant variation in the exchange capacity of the clay minerals present the sorbed major cation concentrations decreased concentrations expressed in eq l in na 91 mg 93 ca 86 and k 5 and the concentration of protons and uranium increased concentrations expressed in eq l in protons 300 uranium 268 300 leading to much higher concentrations in the water at the end of the test than initially for both major cations concentrations expressed in eq l as h multiplied by 1250 ca by 24 mg by 15 k by 18 and na by 1 4 than for the trace cations uranium concentration multiplied by 7 the stock of cations in the solid phase remained stable for potassium and magnesium no dissolution of the minerals carrying these cations decreased for ca dissolution of calcite leading to a 22 decrease in the stock of ca and uranium dissolution of uraninite leading to a 100 decrease in the stock of u as shown by robin et al 2017 and robin et al 2020 dissolution of clay minerals is negligible in acidic isr context even with such a high h rate of occupation once the isr test was completed the protons gradually returned into solution by ion exchange reactions with the cations of the uncontaminated groundwater thus maintaining a stable ph of around 4 in the production area as shown on the 2d distribution of the modeled ph at t 6 years in fig 6 3 after six years of modeling at the level of the extraction well isrp 0001 the distribution of cation stocks had changed 1 the sorbed stock was restructured a lower concentration in protons 26 compared to the end of the test an increase in sorbed sodium and potassium concentrations na 310 compared to the initial state k 64 compared to the initial state and a decrease in magnesium and sorbed calcium concentrations mg 81 compared to the initial state ca 57 compared to the initial state 2 the aqueous stock had decreased ca 99 with respect to the end of the test mg 100 with respect to the end of the test na 74 with respect to the end of the test k 98 from the end of the test u 100 from the end of the test and 3 the solid stock remained stable ca 78 of the initial stock stable since the end of the test mg 99 of the initial stock against 100 at the end of the test the impact on ph seems to be effectively restricted to the production cell and its close vicinity 10 m the lower ph values observed at the extraction and monitoring wells below the cell are thus stabilized by the presence of smectite type clay minerals and their cation exchange properties see fig 3 2 as long as all the protons have not been desorbed by the arrival of non impacted water linked to the natural flow of the aquifer the ph will remain between 4 and 5 in the production area 5 3 modeling makes it possible to represent the behaviour of trace elements such as uranium and 226ra the amplitude and trend of the peak uranium concentration at the extraction well is well reproduced by modeling considering the density flow and the sorption reactions of the clay minerals which show clearly that these are the two major mechanisms involved in the natural attenuation of uranium on the other hand the modeling showed an increase in uranium concentrations u tot modeled 5 10 5 mol l at t 2 years in the isrz 0010 piezometer while the measurements taken showed a stable concentration of around 2 10 8 mol l see fig 4 1 this difference is explained by several factors 1 the distribution of the mineralizations in the model was taken as homogeneous and constant whereas it is certain that in reality a spatial heterogeneity exists but is not known precisely at the scale of the modeled zone therefore this simplification was considered acceptable in view of the modeling objectives 2 due to numerical non convergence pyrite was not considered in the modeled system reducing conditions downstream of the mineralized zone were therefore not dictated by the pyrite leading to an underestimation of the aquifer s redox buffer capacities since uranium is mobile under oxidizing conditions reimus et al 2019 this configuration could explain an increased mobility of the modeled uranium finally 3 for the same reasons as for the distribution of the mineralizations the distribution of the permeable impermeable facies was somewhat simplified in our model yet impermeable screens play a crucial role in the lateral spreading of the plume perhaps causing this increase in modeled concentrations concerning 226ra as stated above only the production well was modeled to avoid the effects of gravity flows present for the other piezometers as illustrated in fig s4 supplementary information the modeling of 226ra concentrations in production solutions is not representative of the monitoring data if only the cation exchange mechanism is considered 226ra modeled hytec 1116 bq l at t 30 days versus 226 ra observed 75 bq l at t 40 days it is necessary to add the co precipitation in the barite to correctly model the behaviour of 226ra and thus obtain a modeled peak at 94 bq l at t 30 days the stabilization of 226ra concentrations around 10 bq l is related to the moderately acidic conditions imposed by the sorption on clay minerals for ph values below 4 5 the proton is the majority component in the sum of sorbed cations so 226ra sorption was not observed however co precipitation in barite is not affected by ph which explains the 10 bq l range above ph 4 the clay minerals deprotonate and 226ra sorption reduces their concentrations to background levels in conclusion based on the modeling and monitoring data acquired in this test natural attenuation was observed for the main markers of isr solutions namely ph sulfate uranium and 226ra concentrations and is based on many mechanisms such as dilution of the salt plume cation exchange with the clay minerals and coprecipitation within minerals such as barite a future consideration of the reduction of metals a mechanism that was not included in this study due to numerical convergence issues using different approaches microbial activity presence of minerals with high reducing power such as pyrite will certainly eliminate some of the artifacts observed in this study particularly concerning uranium 5 4 effect of cell size the problem of the mesh cell size for the modeling is both related to the computation time the finer the mesh the longer the computations will be and to how representative it is to the heterogeneities of the aquifer the coarser the mesh the more the heterogeneities are smoothed or positioned approximately in order to evaluate the effect of this parameter a modeling with a mesh consisting of 4950 cells of dimensions 4 m 4 m see fig s9 supplementary information over the same area as the reference mesh 78 000 cells of 1 m 1 m was performed this cell size was closer to the one used to model the functioning of isr production lagneau et al 2019 as expected the modeling with 4950 cells progressed much faster than with 78 000 cells 25 min against 15 5 h with identical geochemistry the change of cell size does not drastically impact the modeling of the extraction well but the monitoring piezometers were less well modeled with a coarser mesh notably isrz 0010 see fig 8 1 2 and 3 the extraction well is generally well represented because the distribution of uranium at its level is well known and homogeneous core deposit and there is no major impermeable interlayer the increase in cell size therefore does not affect the model s validity however once outside the operating area heterogeneities seem to play a stronger role in the changes in ph and the uranium and sulfate concentrations the plume dive at the isrz 0008 piezometer located directly below the production cell is well represented during production but the decrease in sulfate concentrations is underestimated by the model so4 total modeled 6 4 10 2 mol l at t 6 years versus so4 total observed 1 7 10 2 mol l at the same date at the level of the isrz 0013 well no increase in sulfate concentration is modeled however it was observed the cell size here implies a too large numerical dilution of the plume laterally the modeling of the isrz 0010 piezometer shows an overall overestimation of sulfate and uranium concentrations and a ph too low modeled ph 4 against observed ph 6 at t 6 years the salt plume seems to arrive too concentrated and put uranium in solution in contrast with the reality two phenomena explain this the cell size requires 1 further smoothing of the uranium distribution and 2 a coarser representation of the permeable impermeable facies thus to correctly represent the post operations changes at short time intervals of the contaminants of interest it is necessary to be sufficiently representative of the heterogeneities uranium distribution distribution of clay interlayers and therefore to use a relatively fine mesh however 2d modeling is sufficient where in production it is necessary to use a much more complex 3d model lagneau et al 2019 6 conclusions the dulaan uul isr test shows that it is feasible to implement a modeling approach combining the production 200 days and post production up to 6 years after the start of the test phases the available data show an impact currently limited to the zone directly below the production cell and its near vicinity 10 m the ph stabilized at around 4 in the production area itself and around 5 5 below the cell the sulfate ions were mainly diluted by the plume plunging down into the aquifer the uranium and 226ra illustrate that natural attenuation is taking place uranium concentrations in water fell to background levels two years after the end of the test and 226ra concentrations were never as high as expected about 10 of the expected value is observed at the extraction well isrp 0001 those values were observed at an isr test scale and cannot be directly extended when upscaling to an industrial exploitation scale lagneau et al 2019 mining operations in this case govern strongly the plume distances and expected duration for natural attenuation the modeling of this isr test and associated environmental monitoring reveals four parameters necessary for a good representation of the changes in ph and the concentrations of sulfate uranium and 226ra i density flow ii cation exchanges with clay minerals iii co precipitation of 226ra with barite and iv model mesh dimensions for correctly accounting hydrogeological heterogeneities due to the difference in density between the injection solutions and the aquifer water it is necessary to consider the density flow for a good representation of the behaviour of sulfate ions the major mechanism affecting the ph is cation exchange on clay minerals the rapid decrease in ph during the timespan of operations modifies the distribution of exchangeable cations with the protons occupying up to 89 of the available exchange sites once the isr test was completed the protons gradually returned to solution by ion exchange reactions with the cations of the uncontaminated groundwater thus creating a stable ph of around 4 in the production area concerning the behaviour of 226ra the key mechanism at work is co precipitation within the barite making it possible to capture about 90 of the radium released when the injection solutions arrive this mechanism was not implemented in the hytec version used in this study so the changes in 226ra behaviour were only modeled at the scale of the extraction well isrp 0001 finally it is highlighted that the representation of the heterogeneities from a hydrogeological point of view distribution of permeabilities in particular as much as a geological distribution of oxidized mineralized and reduced zones requires a sufficiently fine mesh 1 m 1 m cells without requiring the use of 3d models that would drastically increase the need for

1470,this article presents the results of groundwater monitoring over a period of six years and the interpretation of these results by a reactive transport model following an in situ recovery isr test on the dulaan uul uranium deposit in mongolia an environmental monitoring survey was set up using 17 piezometers from which it has been possible to describe the changes in the water composition before during and after the isr test the water quality before the start of mining activities rendered it unfit for human consumption during and after the test a descent of the saline plume was observed resulting in a dilution of the injection solutions after a rapid decrease to ph 1 13 during the production phase of the isr test the ph stabilized at around 4 in the production area and 5 5 below the production cell one year after the end of the test uranium and radium were being naturally attenuated uranium returned to background concentrations 0 3 mg l after two years and the measured 226ra concentrations represent no more than 10 of the expected concentrations during production 75 bq l the modeling of the contaminants of concern mobility namely ph and concentrations of sulfate uranium and 226ra is based on several key complementary mechanisms density flow cation exchange with clay minerals and co precipitation of 226ra in the barite the modeling results show that the observed plume descent and sulfate dilution can only be predicted if consideration of a high density flow is included similarly the changes in ph and 226ra concentration are only correctly predicted when the cationic exchanges with the clays and the co precipitation reaction within the barite using the solid solution theory are integrated into the models finally the proper representation of the changes in water composition at the scale of the test requires the use of a sufficiently fine mesh 1 m 1 m cell to take into account the spatial variability of hydrogeological permeability distribution in particular and geological reduced oxidized and mineralized facies distributions parameters graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords in situ recovery uranium 226ra natural attenuation reactive transport modeling 1 introduction world uranium production is now mainly accomplished by in situ recovery isr with 29 492 tons produced in 2017 or nearly 50 of world production wna 2018 this mining technique the first evidence of which dates back to roman antiquity is also used to extract evaporites potash natron and halite in addition to uranium isr is also used for other metals such as copper and gold kuhar et al 2018 martens et al 2012 seredkin et al 2016 sinclair and thompson 2015 this mining method consists of dissolving the uranium contained in permeable mainly sandstone geological formations in situ using leaching solutions the solubilized ore is then pumped to the surface and the uranium extracted iaea 2001 the leaching solution is then re injected into the well system after its properties have been renewed the leaching solutions used for uranium production by isr are of two types alkaline and acidic the other possibility is acid leaching most often sulphuric as practiced since the 1960s in countries of eastern europe central europe and central asia kazakhstan uzbekistan russia ukraine bulgaria czech republic but also in china and australia iaea 2016 märten 2006 compared to more traditional mining methods isr has attractive investment costs due to the absence of ore extraction and mechanical processing isr also has low operating costs that make it possible to bring low or very low grade deposits in the order of 100 ppm of uranium into production seredkin et al 2016 the deposits targeted for isr extraction are mainly roll front fig s1 supplementary information these are epigenetic concentrations of uranium within the terrigenous sedimentary series in intermountain and epicontinental basins dahlkamp 2010 mineralized orebodies are found within permeable sandy layers with several superimposed mineralized layers generally present in the same basin sometimes several hundred meters thick mineralization corresponds to the presence of a redox front separating a reduced downstream area rich in organic matter and often sulphides and an upstream area where the sediments appear leached and or oxidized since uranium is insoluble under reducing conditions it precipitates in contact with the reducing zone in the form of uraninite and coffinite woldegabriel et al 2014 zammit et al 2014 unlike many other types of uranium deposits roll front deposits are low grade whilst also often having considerable tonnage and extension at depths that can reach several hundred meters another necessary condition for isr extraction is the confinement of the mineralized reservoir generally by low permeability clay screens thus isolating the exploited reservoir from other adjacent aquifers it is the mine operator s responsibility to monitor the hydraulic balance between the injection and the production wells in order to limit the risks of a potential spread of leaching solutions outside the mine s boundary jeuken et al 2007 these processes had not been verified in the case of the stráž mine in the czechoslovak republic resulting in significant pollution of an aquifer dedicated to drinking water supply smetana et al 2002 reactive transport models are increasingly developed to optimize the operational recovery parameters such as injection flow rates and the ph of the injection solution by taking into account the heterogeneity of the geological formation being mined see for example bonnaud et al 2015 johnson and tutu 2016 lagneau et al 2019 regnault et al 2015 however these studies are often not published for confidentiality reasons see for example martens et al 2012 simon et al 2014 staub et al 1986 woods and jeuken 2015 isr mining is considered to result in a limited environmental impact on the surface compared to other mining techniques in addition no mill tailings is generated ballini et al 2020 chautard et al 2020 déjeant et al 2016 the main environmental impacts associated to isr mining are related to water quality in the mineralized aquifer and the risk of contaminating adjacent aquifers mudd 2001a 2001b saunders et al 2016 this last point is often questioned by stakeholders acting for the societal and environmental acceptance of mines operated by isr this is partly due to the limited data available to date in the scientific literature particularly regarding the environmental impact of acid isr exploitation knowledge on this topic had just started to emerge clay 2015 the initial water quality of uranium mineralized aquifers is generally poor with high natural levels of metals and radioelements 238u and its descendants but also salinity levels of up to several g l they are unsuitable for human consumption ariunbileg et al 2016 and belong to a class for industrial or technical use isr extraction generates a saline plume in the mining zones following the injection of the leaching solutions and the chemical reactions with the mineralized host dissolution precipitation sorption the criteria for the remediation of mineralized aquifers exploited using isr depend on the legislation of the countries where the mines are located however it is possible to identify a general consensus that is to return to a physicochemical water quality comparable to that observed before mining the definition of water quality may vary from one country to another for example it may be required to return it to a strictly identical state in terms of chemical composition or instead to verify a range of concentrations which will maintain the initial class of the aquifer being mined this illustrates the importance of establishing the initial hydrogeochemical background levels by taking into account the spatial variability in the chemical composition of the water inherent in the geochemistry of the mineralized aquifer for example we can distinguish between the hydraulic upstream part of the deposit characterized by oxidizing conditions and the mineralized and the hydraulic downstream zones both characterized by reducing conditions and highly variable dissolved uranium contents in the case of acid isr mining it is possible to distinguish several contaminants and physicochemical parameters of interest ph linked to the acidification of the mineralized zone so4 ions also linked to the acidification of the extraction zone use of sulphuric acid dissolved residual uranium 226ra from the dissolution of the ore as well as other radioactive descendants of uranium and finally other metals and cations solubilized by the acidification and oxidation of the mined mineralized zone three main approaches to the remediation of aquifers mined by isr currently stand out 1 the implementation of regular environmental monitoring and modeling to assess the natural attenuation potential of the mined reservoir 2 enhanced natural attenuation notably via biostimulation and 3 pump and treat natural attenuation is based partly on the geochemical ability of the geological host to buffer the chemical disturbance associated with the injection of the oxidizing solution and partly on the natural dilution of the salt plume generated during mining this remediation strategy has been used beyond the single context of acid isr see christensen et al 2004 jørgensen et al 2010 natural attenuation has a clear economic advantage since this solution is accompanied simply by environmental monitoring with if required predictive geochemical modeling davis and curtis 2007 jeuken et al 2009 the durations involved are longer than for pump and treat and bioremediation solutions but can be reduced in the case of assisted natural attenuation as proposed by park et al 2007 as a result the remediation of isr sites by natural attenuation remains poorly documented although some examples are available in the scientific literature bakarzhiyev et al 2004 dong et al 2016 fyodorov 2002 iaea 2005 yazikov and zabaznov 2002 enhanced natural attenuation is one of the alternative aquifer remediation strategies that have been developed initially and mainly outside the isr context the solutions developed are mainly based on immobilizing the contaminants within the aquifer by optimizing the physicochemical conditions of the host environment it is interesting to note the development in recent years of so called biostimulation solutions resulting in particular from work carried out on the treatment of polluted soils biostimulation aims to bio catalyse the chemical reactions necessary to achieve the remediation objectives jemison et al 2020 long et al 2008 these solutions have sometimes gone beyond the simple experimental stage and have been applied on an industrial scale notably for certain organic compounds in the case of uranium several industrial biostimulation tests have recently been carried out see for example groudev et al 2008 2010 long et al 2015 in the more specific context of isr operations biostimulation work is currently underway both at alkaline sites hall 2009 wu et al 2006a 2006b yabusaki et al 2007 2014 and acid sites coral et al 2018 descostes et al 2014 finally pump and treat has been widely deployed in the united states in the context of alkaline isr operations it focuses mainly on water treatment where appropriate in several stages iaea 2001 2005 i pumping out the contaminated water after the end of mining operations the leached area is thus in contact with the uncontaminated aquifer ii treating the contaminated water on the surface usually by reverse osmosis and then re injecting it into the leached area iii if necessary adding a chemical reducer e g h2s or na2s in situ or ex situ to promote the precipitation of insoluble metals under reducing conditions iv pumping out the injected water again and then re injecting it to enhance the mixing phase in view of the feedback from experience gained mainly under alkaline isr operating conditions it is now considered that this expensive solution does not necessarily meet the initial objectives of remediation hall 2009 yabusaki et al 2014 indeed the sensu stricto treatment of water does not take into consideration the stock of contaminants of interest in their entirety plaue and czerwinski 2002 thus the contaminants of interest may be immobilized within the aquifer either as neoformed minerals or sorbed onto the surfaces of the aquifer s host minerals mainly of clay dangelmayr et al 2018 johnson and tutu 2016 robin et al 2015b 2017 2020 the gradual return of the natural hydraulic gradient leads to chemical reactions between the uncontaminated groundwater and the solid fraction of the leachate zone which will tend to remobilize the adsorbed contaminants anastasi and williams 1984 also even if the water from the leached area is treated in the short term a remobilization of contaminants can be observed in the longer term when the equilibrium conditions of the leached area are modified by the return of uncontaminated water see examples given in hall 2009 in order to assess the best solution for the remediation of mineralized aquifers mined by acid isr several complementary approaches are available in particular 1 observations at mine sites operated by acid isr 2 laboratory tests 3 the establishment of pilot sites 4 geochemical modeling recent exploration work carried out by cogegobi llc a subsidiary of the orano group has led to the discovery of two major roll front uranium deposits in the tsagaan els basin of mongolia dulaan uul and zuuvch ovoo cardon et al 2015 grizard et al 2019 these deposits are currently the subject of feasibility studies for in situ acid leaching and it is in this context that an isr test has been carried out at the dulaan uul deposit the pilot site of dulaan uul can be considered for modelers as a relevant work tool this site equipped with numerous environmental monitoring piezometers 17 made it possible to monitor the post operations natural attenuation from december 2010 to may 2017 with the benefit of a comprehensive set of data broad sampling both spatially and temporally the dulaan uul site is therefore a high quality calibration point for environmental monitoring models which aim to propose an environmental remediation scenario solely by natural attenuation or coupled with reprocessing bioremediation adapted to the local geochemistry this article presents the results of the environmental monitoring of the isr test carried out at the dulaan uul deposit over a six year period as well as the geochemical modeling of the behaviour of the various contaminants of interest which are ph so4 ions and also uranium and 226ra this work makes it possible to understand the nature of the impact caused by acid isr exploitation and to develop reactive transport models focused on the chemical changes during and after the isr test based on water quality monitoring and available mineralogical and hydrogeological data as a result this work helps to identify the key geochemical mechanisms and the degree of precision of their consideration to correctly represent these changes both during the test phase and during environmental monitoring after the test has been completed ultimately the operator will have access to a tool and to some key information that will enable him to choose the appropriate remediation method based on the legislative and environmental constraints of the site being operated 2 presentation of the dulaan uul deposit and the associated isr test 2 1 description of the dulaan uul deposit the dulaan uul deposit is located in southeast mongolia 500 km from ulaan baatar in the southern part of the dornogobi aïmag province see fig s2 supplementary information this is a roll front deposit with an average grade of 150 ppmu and 6500 tu of resources cardon et al 2015 le goux et al 2015 located at a depth of 40 160 m the reader is referred to the studies of graham et al 2001 johnson 2004 and prost 2004 for a detailed geological description of the region the deposit is located within the unegt sedimentary sub basin which together with the zuunbayan sub basin constitutes the tsagaan els basin the bedrock of the area s formations consists of land dating from the paleozoic to the triassic a first phase of rifting created fault troughs and caused the opening of small basins including the one at unegt this period of sustained volcanism and expansion thinned the continental lithosphere and prepared for an uplift of the mantle which had become hotter an intensive abrasion phase then followed the rifting phase and eroded the relief the whole area was then molded by a fluvial to fluviolacustrine continental sedimentation zuunbayan formation lower cretaceous on which the sainshand sediments began to randomly settle late lower cretaceous the sainshand river series are characterized by very large lateral variations in facies between the main axes of the channels coarse facies conglomerates sands silts and the flood plains fine to very fine facies clays and paleosols two formations of equivalent thickness k2ss1 and k2ss2 were identified in the sainshand grizard et al 2019 k2ss2 formation is the host formation of the uranium mineralizations uranium rich oxidized waters from granitic formations would have circulated through a drainage system to form the roll fronts observed in k2ss2 the environment of the mineralization deposit is that of an interlinked hydrographic system that gradually changed to a meandering river system where floodplains developed and sandy areas diminished the chain of events of several of these sequences river system and floodplains would be at the origin of the k2ss2 formation and its four lithological units u1 to u4 the mineralizations are well developed and continuous in the upper part of the u2 unit between 106 and 117 m deep in the area of umnut isr test they extend transversely over 200 m with a thickness that varies from 5 to 23 m the presence of clay screens delimiting the u2 stratigraphic unit and the medium to coarse sandy facies of this unit are conducive to an in situ leaching test three main geochemical facies are found on the deposit an oxidized facies corresponding to the hydraulic upstream part of the deposit a reduced facies corresponding to the hydraulic downstream part of the deposit and finally a mineralized reduced facies corresponding to mineralization at the interface of the oxidized and reduced zones cf fig 1 2 2 petrography and mineralogy the summarized elements of petrography and mineralogy are provided here the reader should refer to angileri et al 2020 cardon et al 2015 and robin et al 2020 for a more detailed description but also to the work on the zuuvch ovoo deposit which has strong similarities pons 2015 rallakis et al 2018 these are medium to coarse sands rich in lithic elements mainly quartz and alkaline feldspar albite and orthosis characteristic of detrital elements that have been transported over a short distance some grains have fractures cracks corresponding to dissolution and recrystallization patterns they are evidence of a strong hydrothermal alteration temperatures 200 c which occurred before erosion and transport of the detrital minerals some partial replacements of the mineral by silicates of the chlorite mica biotite epidote and sometimes pyrite types are thus observed among the accessory minerals present in the mineral array of the lithic elements magmatic minerals apatite ilmenite fe or ti oxides zircon and monazite and hydrothermal minerals epidote barite and pyrite are observed the matrix of these sands is clayey in nature and is located around the grains it is mainly composed of smectite of the montmorillonite type and of kaolinite as well as framboidal pyrite of diagenetic origin robin et al 2020 some carbonate mineral occurrences are also found but the content remains low 1 on the redox front zone and within the reduced zone the uranium phases appear late the mineralizations show clearly visible uraninite minerals of very pure composition frequently with 80 to 85 uranium oxide they are often associated with carbonaceous materials lignite type or as a partial replacement for iron and titanium oxides angileri et al 2020 in the area being studied the main characteristics of the ore are 1 an average uranium content of 200 ppm 2 a low carbonate content of about 0 66 3 an average rock density of 1 6 and 4 a fairly coarse grain size as previously mentioned smectite 3 10 w and barite 340 1000 ppm are known to be present these minerals play a key role in regulating water chemistry most notably in the natural attenuation mechanisms indeed smectite due to its cation exchange properties robin et al 2015a 2015b 2017 will play a leading role in the behaviour of u 226ra and also ph barite on the other hand is a trap for 226ra by co precipitation curti et al 2010 these initially present minerals are also observed after leaching angileri et al 2020 as was also observed in a similar isr context in kazakhstan robin et al 2015a 2015b the mineralogical paragenesis considered for geochemical modeling is defined below 2 3 hydrogeology the unegt basin is endorheic with captive to semi captive groundwater grizard et al 2019 k2ss2 appears as a multilayer aquifer composed of four sandy units u1 to u4 separated by impermeable clayed layers the flow is from west to east similar to surface flow with a regional hydraulic gradient limited by the endorheic character estimated at 0 13 within u2 unit at the scale of the deposit of dulaan uul the u2 unit is considered to be a confined aquifer in coarse sand with high porosity and permeability its main hydrogeological characteristics are presented in table s1 in supplementary information 2 4 regional water geochemistry the uranium fronts in the dulaan uul area are considered as fossils mineralization uranium and related metals is remobilized by the aquifer flows the water of the unegt basin and that of the u2 unit in particular must be considered unfit for human consumption ariunbileg et al 2016 it is of the sodium chloride chemical type with an accessory component of sulfate its ph is moderately alkaline 7 6 to 8 6 conductivity is high 1500 to 3600 μs cm indicating water with a high dissolved content the uranium concentrations are naturally high with values up to 0 48 mg l throughout the central zone of the basin there are also concentrations of certain metals iron manganese molybdenum selenium arsenic that exceed the permissible standard levels the spatial variability of the hydrochemistry linked to the presence of the uranium roll front complicates the monitoring of the exploited aquifers it is difficult to define a single local baseline see for instance ariunbileg et al 2016 the modeling therefore requires the definition of three types of water rock equilibria oxidized mineralized reduced in their initial state these will be detailed in the next section 2 5 water geochemistry on the scale of the isr test the chemical composition of the water was monitored on a dedicated network of piezometers in the area of the isr test see fig 1 no marked zonation of the major elements is observed see table s3 in supplementary information the water is moderately alkaline of the sodium chloride type with a minor sulfate component as expected the zonation is significantly more pronounced for elements sensitive to oxidation reduction conditions fe as se and u the average u concentrations vary from 0 04 mg l or 1 7 10 7 mol l in the oxidized zone to 0 26 mg l or 1 1 10 6 mol l in the mineralized zone and 0 01 mg l or 4 9 10 8 mol l in the reduced zone the same behaviour is observed for fe 1 6 10 3 mmol l in the upstream oxidized zone 2 0 10 3 mmol l in the mineralized zone and 7 2 10 4 mmol l in the reduced zone as 1 8 10 5 mmol l in the upstream oxidized zone 2 2 10 5 mmol l in the mineralized zone and 1 2 10 5 mmol l in the reduced zone and se 4 7 10 5 mmol l in the upstream oxidized zone 1 2 10 4 mmol l in the mineralized zone and 7 5 10 6 mmol l in the reduced zone from the point of view of both

selenium 2 6 description of the isr test and monitoring network the in situ acid leaching test was conducted in the umnut southwest mineralized area from december 1 2010 to june 20 2011 over a period of 201 days during the test period 212 9 t of sulphuric acid were injected into cell 1 with an average ph of injection solutions of about 1 2 2879 kg of uranium were extracted monitoring of the aquifer continues to this day sampling was performed following the best quality standards for groundwaters piezometer aqueous volume replaced at least 3 times physico chemical parameters stabilization filtration and conditioning acidification were achieved right after the sampling on the field to prevent any oxidation and subsequent precipitation among the many chemical elements measured we can mention those presented in this study namely ph aqueous concentrations of calcium magnesium sodium potassium sulfates uranium and 226ra verification of the charge balance of the solutions allows to regard the entire dataset used in this study as consistent conductivity was not measured during test operations therefore in order to monitor the changes in the salt plume generated by the injection of sulphuric acid the sulfate concentration data were used instead of conductivity data see fig s3 in supplementary information the injection of sulphuric acid led to a drastic increase in concentrations of sulfate ions and protons sulfate ions therefore constituted the major anion and could as a first approximation be considered as non reactive with the host in contrast with the protons aquifer monitoring is carried out using 17 piezometers located in the isr test area and in the lower u1 isrz 0006 piezometer and upper u3 isrz 0007 piezometer aquifers see fig 1 as shown on the vertical section in fig 1 the screens of the environmental monitoring piezometers are located so as to provide information on the temporal and spatial changes in the salt plume generated by the isr test thus the piezometers isrz 0002 and isrz 0008 are located directly below the production cell the screens being positioned directly above a clay layer onto which the salt plume sinks the isrz 0010 piezometer is configured in the same way but 10 m downstream so as to assess the lateral extension of the plume over time finally other piezometers are located further from the production cells and were screened over a greater height isrz 0001 50 m upstream 39 m screened isrz 0005 50 m downstream 39 m screened in order to monitor water quality at the aquifer scale 3 materials and methods 3 1 modeling tools the reactive transport modeling was carried out using hytec v 4 2 software coupling the chess geochemistry code v3 9 release 1 patchlevel 2 to an r2d2 fluid transport model lagneau and van der lee 2010 van der lee et al 2003 hytec is based on an operator splitting algorithm sequential iterative scheme for coupling between transport and chemistry flow and transport are solved using finite volume based on a voronoi or regular grid in 1 to 3d with a one step centered crank nicholson time discretization chemistry resolution is based on the primary component or basis species approach lichtner 1996 with mixed thermodynamically or kinetically controlled reactions the resulting algebra differential system of equations is solved using an analytical formulation of the jacobian the calculations were run on 24 cpus the thermodynamic database used was that of the lawrence livermore national laboratory e q3 6 version 8 it was completed by the sorption exchange constants of the major cations h na na k ca2 mg2 and traces 226ra u vi on the kaolinite and montmorillonite according to a multi site formalism presented in reinoso maset and ly 2016 2014 the gravity flows induced by the density difference between the leaching solution and the aquifer water were taken into account by considering the differences in salinity baxter and wallace 1916 guo and langevin 2002 the post processing of the results was performed using paraview v5 0 0 ahrens et al 2005 ayachit 2015 in the case of 226ra post processing was performed using excel see dedicated section the spatial and temporal changes in water chemistry were modeled on the basis of the environmental monitoring from the beginning of the isr test to 2145 days later i e over nearly six years 3 2 construction of the model due to the difference in density between the leaching solution density 1 022 and the aquifer water density 1 001 a density flow was observed during the test vertical 2d modeling was therefore preferred over horizontal 2d modeling in order to correctly represent this phenomenon with the objective of analyzing one cell only it was decided to model the south west north east axis the production cell is represented by an injection well extraction well injection well axis with an injection well extraction well separation of 15 m the east west regional flow was assessed using the conditions at the cell boundaries with a value of 2 m year grizard 2017 it was considered negligible during the modeling period the mineralized zone was modeled as a homogeneous zone with an average u grade of 200 ppm fig 2 this simplifying hypothesis may generate some differences in intensity over short time intervals in the modeling but does not undermine the geochemical trends observed the distribution of permeable sand and impermeable clay zones was simplified in order to keep only the clay interlayers that have an impact on the salt plume flow i e with a lateral continuity of several meters and measuring more than 50 cm thick the modeling results are presented mainly for the piezometers where variations in chemical composition were visible namely isrp 0001 the extraction well screened over 11 m located in the mineralized zone isrz 0008 located below the cell to monitor plume plunging this piezometer is screened over two zones of 6 m separated by 9 m un screened and is located in the reduced zone isrz 0010 located 10 m downstream from the cell at a lower level in order to follow the plume downstream from the test it is screened over 17 m and is in the reduced zone isrz 0013 located below the cell the 6 m screen is positioned directly above the clay base to monitor the arrival of the salt plume and is in the reduced zone isrz 0005 located 50 m downstream and screened over a height of 39 m this piezometer did not show any effect and due to the considerable size of the screen can be taken as the most representative of the quality of the non exploited groundwater it is mainly in a reduced area but intercepts a flank of the mineralized zone over 6 m the modeling mesh used in this study consists of 78 000 cells measuring 1 m 1 m over a 600 m 130 m area it modeled the test and its impact to date and allowed the model to be validated on the measurements p1 extraction well and monitoring piezometers a second mesh consisting of 4950 cells measuring 4 m 4 m over an identical area was also tested to assess the sensitivity of this parameter to the results 3 3 construction of the geochemical model simulating the impact of the isr test on aquifer waters requires the prior construction of a geochemical model describing the porous medium studied this model is based on the determination of a combination of minerals compatible with the mineralogical observations angileri et al 2020 le goux et al 2015 pons 2015 robin et al 2020 which are considered to be in equilibrium with the interstitial waters by respecting the three zones of interest delineated by the redox front the oxidized mineralized and reduced zones the calculations are also based on the cation exchange properties of clay minerals here mainly smectite robin et al 2015b 2020 see note 1 in supplementary information the total exchange capacity of the rock is set to 1 36 meq 100 g according to the content of smectite and kaolinite and their respective exchange capacities the total porosity considered for the model is 27 the proportions of minerals constituting the reactive paragenesis were chosen so as to respect the available thin section and total rock analyses the main differences between the reduced oxidized and mineralized zones concern the calcite and uraninite contents see table s4 in supplementary information for reasons of numerical convergence the pyrite was removed from the system by imposing the oxidation reduction potential in the reduced zones mineralized 200 mv she reduced 220 mv she resulting in an underestimation of the redox buffer capacities of the aquifer reimus et al 2019 in relation to the metals the latter being insoluble under reducing conditions but mobile under oxidizing conditions the modeled results were therefore increased the clay minerals were represented by montmorillonite 85 and kaolinite 15 with a total clay mineral content of 5 7 finally kinetic constants were used for kaolinite alpha cristobalite uraninite microcline montmorillonite goethite and barite giammar 2001 palandri and kharaka 2004 robin et al 2015b the injection solutions were modeled in two phases 1 an initial phase with a ph of about 1 06 injected during the first 20 days of the test operation and 2 a recirculation phase between t 21 days and the end of the test where the solutions pumped into the extraction wells were reinjected into the injection wells once the uranium had been extracted the ph being about 1 24 the complete composition of these two solutions is available in table s5 supplementary information 3 4 226ra modeling at the extraction well level the source term of 226ra was modeled by 1 its incorporation into the 238u decay phase a ratio for 238u 226ra of 2 was assumed for this in accordance with the average age of the mineralizations between 0 3 and 0 5 my and 2 by cationic exchanges with the clay minerals present reinoso maset and ly 2014 2016 robin et al 2017 co precipitation within barite curti et al 2010 was not included in the hytec version used for this study so this mechanism was not taken into account in representing the source term of 226ra and has therefore been disregarded 226ra is therefore distributed as 99 97 inside the uraninite and 0 03 sorbed onto clay minerals via cation exchange however to represent the mobility of 226ra in the system after acidification it is necessary to consider the cation exchange properties with the clay minerals as well as the co precipitation within the barite the mineralogical observations as well as the saturation indices for this mineralogical phase calculated from the environmental monitoring data the calculated saturation index varies between 0 33 and 3 02 with an average of 1 01 indicate its occurrence and stability throughout the isr test angileri et al 2020 robin et al 2020 co precipitation was considered retrospectively after the hytec calculations by using a constant 226 radium aqueous solid repartition coefficient k 0 07824 this coefficient was obtained using the chess software thermodynamic calculation part of hytec through batch calculations which integrated the solid solution theory based on a thermodynamic database relating to the solid solution between the raso4 and baso4 poles curti et al 2010 in an isr context i e using aqueous barium concentration of 0 5 μmol l and aqueous sulfate concentration of 0 4 mol l with this input concentration barite is oversaturated and is expected to precipitate the distribution of radium between the aqueous phase and the barite was calculated for different radium concentration values in water and shows a constant 226 radium aqueous solid repartition coefficient see table s6 supplementary information the calculations presented were made only for the extraction well isrp 0001 in order to avoid the effects of gravity flows present for the other piezometers this calculation is divided into two phases 1 the release of 226ra by the source term radiferous uraninite with a ratio for 238u 226ra of 2 considering the cation exchange of radium on the clay minerals this step was calculated on the entire 2d modeling grid 2 at the level of the extraction well isrp 0001 226ra co precipitation within the barite is taken into account via a calculation at each time interval which consists of three stages see fig s4

precipitated and therefore immobilized is in an aqueous phase it is therefore incorrect to regard it as mobilized in order to take this inaccuracy into account the 226ra concentration was corrected

modeled using hytec at time t 213 days corresponding to the maximum observed conductivity the first step 2d calculation over time was modeled using hytec during this calculation the saturation index of the barite was calculated to verify its stability in this modeling the radium was divided between the sorbed via cation exchange and the aqueous stocks the 226ra concentration as a function of time was extracted from the modeling at the isrp 0001 extraction well via the paraview interface the second step calculation at the level of the extraction well was performed using excel figure s4 supplementary information clearly shows the changes in the 226ra concentration over the calculation steps the initial concentration calculated using hytec is higher because it does not consider co precipitation the co precipitation with barite 2 i improves the model especially for the peak production of 226ra but does not correctly represent the long term changes when the initial equilibrium with barite is considered 2 ii the modeling of the long term changes in 226ra concentrations is closer to the measured values but it is necessary to correct these values from the gravitational effect 2 iii which generates a long term curve very close to the measured values 4 monitoring results changes in the saline plume and evidence of natural attenuation in this section only the wells which showed significant variations in the measurements are presented namely the extraction well isrp 0001 as well as the piezometers isrz 0008 isrz 0010 and isrz 0013 for comparison the results of the isrz 0005 piezometer which was not affected are also presented no variation in concentration was noted upstream or downstream of the test area and in the overlying and underlying aquifers 4 1 sulfate ions a good tracer of the salt plume as seen above sulfate ions were used to trace the salt plume because the conductivity was not be measured at all points the sulfate concentration outside the isr test was 3 6 10 3 mol l during the test concentrations of 0 15 mol l and then 0 2 mol l were injected at the level of the extraction well the arrival of sulfate ions was relatively rapid from 20 days after the start after 60 days the sulfate concentration stabilized at around 0 15 mol l and eventually decreased rapidly after the end of the test t 200 days during the last three years of monitoring t 3 years to t 6 years the concentrations were stable and in the order of 0 01 mol l seefig 3 1 at the bottom of the production cell the arrival of the salt plume was observed with a time delay of more than 300 days thus a concentration peak of 0 099 mol l is noticeable on the isrz 0008 monitoring well immediately below the cell at t 369 169 days after the end of the test the sulfate concentrations decreased more slowly than for the extraction well to 0 02 mol l the isrz 0013 piezometer located 55 m below the cell on the clay base detected the arrival of the salt plume after five years with a concentration of 7 6 10 3 mol l the plume was significantly attenuated due to its gravity flow descent and the induced dilution laterally an increase in sulfate concentrations was noticeable for the isrz 0010 piezometer located 10 m downstream of the cell the peak concentration was 0 05 mol l 80 days after the end of the test but in view of the piezometer having been put into operation on this date it is possible that the concentrations were higher before the concentrations gradually decreased and stabilized at around 5 10 3 mol l after 6 years less than twice the regional background level finally the piezometer located 50 m downstream isrz 0005 showed no increase in sulfate concentration during the six years of monitoring thus once the isr test was completed the observed sulfate concentrations were significantly reduced mainly due to the descent of the salt plume and its dilution thus leading to a limited impact on the sulfate ions restricted and constrained to the area just under the production cell and its close vicinity 10 m after six years of monitoring 4 2 specific ph behaviour before the isr test the average ph observed in the water was 7 7 the injection solutions were at ph levels of 1 1 for the first 20 days then 1 2 at the level of the extraction well the ph decreased rapidly starting at 20 days and stabilized at around 1 3 after the end of the test the ph rose and remained at around 4 which was observed up to the 6 year point see fig 3 2 under the production cell the isrz 0008 piezometer had stable ph values of around 5 5 as soon as it was installed at t 285 85 days after the end of the isr test further below isrz 0013 had a slightly lower ph starting from t 4 5 years the value observed at t 6 years was 7 5 positioned 10 m downstream the isrz 0010 piezometer had a ph of 5 4 at start up t 285 the latter rose to stabilize at 6 5 from t 2 5 years the piezometer located 50 m downstream isrz 0005 did not show any significant variation in ph over the six years of monitoring the stabilization of ph observed at the different levels depending on the location of the piezometers shows a particular behaviour of the protons in relation to the sulfates 4 3 behaviour of major cations as previously mentioned the water was of the sodium chloride type with a sulfate accessory component the geochemical background concentrations were respectively 1 9 10 2 mol l for na 7 10 4 mol l for ca and mg and 6 10 5 mol l for k a significant increase in concentrations was observed at the extraction well for these four cations na max 3 2 10 2 mol l at t 60 days mg max 2 1 10 2 mol l at t 90 days ca max 1 2 10 2 mol l at t 40 days k max 2 5 10 3 mol l at t 200 days followed by a decrease the return to background levels was observed for na from t 3 years see fig s5 3 supplementary information the other three elements showed a slow decrease in their concentrations in the water with concentrations at t 6 years of 2 10 3 mol l for ca see fig s5 1 supplementary information 2 3 10 3 mol l for mg and 1 3 10 4 mol l for k below the production cell as for the sulfate ions the isrz 0008 piezometer had a peak concentration just after the end of the test notably for mg mg max 3 0 10 2 mol l at t 310 days and na na max 3 7 10 2 mol l at t 285 days and to a lesser extent for ca ca max 1 4 10 2 mol l at t 285 days potassium on the other hand gradually increased to 1 6 10 3 mol l at t 3 years see fig s5 4 supplementary information while the return to background levels was observed for na from t 3 years the other three elements showed a slow decrease in their concentrations in water with concentrations at t 6 years of 6 2 10 3 mol l for ca 5 2 10 3 mol l for mg and 8 3 10 4 mol l for k at the base of the aquifer below the production cell the concentrations of the major cations increased slightly over the final year for na 2 5 10 2 mol l and mg 1 7 10 3 mol l indicating the gradual arrival of the salt plume onto the clay base already visible in the changes in the sulfate concentrations finally a lower peak concentration of major cations na max 2 7 10 2 mol l at t 370 days mg max 1 6 10 2 mol l at t 285 days ca max 8 9 10 3 mol l at t 285 days k max 3 6 10 4 mol l at t 370 days was observed laterally at the isrz 0010 structure located 10 m downstream from the production cell the return to background levels was observed for ca na and k magnesium had a residual concentration of 1 3 10 3 mol l at t 6 years see fig s5 2 supplementary information the increased concentrations of the major cations clearly show that sulphuric acid reacts with the host by releasing na ca mg and to a lesser extent k this point will be discussed later section 5 2 4 4 natural attenuation of uranium and 226ra uranium and radium both exhibit specific behaviours clearly illustrating the phenomenon of natural attenuation as a reminder the extraction well was located in the mineralized zone while all the other piezometers mentioned in this study were in the reduced zone in the mineralized zone the background level of 226ra was 2 7 bq l on average with uranium s being 1 1 10 6 mol l 3 2 bq l in the reduced zone it was 0 42 bq l for radium and 4 9 10 8 mol l 0 14 bq l for uranium only the extraction well isrp 0001 showed an increase in uranium concentrations uo2 max 4 10 4 mol l or 95 mg l at t 40 days seefig 4 1 during the test operation period at the end of two years unlike the major cations and sulfate ions the observed dissolved uranium concentrations were very low in the order of the background levels at the various sampling points thus as soon as the isr test was completed no impact was observed on the dissolved uranium for 226ra the extraction well isrp 0001 had an increase of two orders of magnitude to 75 bq l see fig 4 2 this peak was quickly absorbed by an order of magnitude and stabilized at around 10 bq l after 150 days of test operation the isrz 0008 and isrz 0010 piezometers had concentrations in the order of 1 to 2 bq l at the end of the test with an observed return to background levels about 1 year after the end of the test for isrz 0010 and 3 years after the end of the test for isrz 0008 finally isrz 0013 and isrz 0005 did not show a significant variation in 226ra concentration the measured values being of the order of the background levels 0 28 bq l on average for isrz 0005 and 0 088 bq l on average for isrz 0013 226ra and uranium are considered to have a disequilibrium of 2 in the ore which given that all the uraninite is dissolved at the level of the production area would imply dissolved uranium activities twice as large as those for radium however as shown in fig 4 3 226ra activity was lower than expected 75 bq l for 226ra compared to 1 175 bq l for uranium indicating that about 90 of the 226ra was immobilized between the time of dissolution and its arrival at the extraction well i e a maximum of 15 days the residence time of the injected solutions this result is in agreement with alpha autoradiography observations performed on thin sections of samples before and after the isr test angileri et al 2020 5 modeling and discussion in this section 1 the gravity flow to better represent the changes in water chemistry during and after the isr test 2 the cationic exchange reactions of clay minerals 3 the results of modeling the behaviour of the trace elements uranium and 226ra and 4 the appropriate balance between the cell size of the model and the representation of the observations made in the field are discussed 5 1 demonstration of the gravitational effect the modeled injection solutions had a tds total dissolved solid value equal to 16 21 g l for the first 20 days then 23 5 g l between t 21 days and the end of the test whereas before operations the water tds was 1 5 g l this difference results in a significant density contrast between the injected solutions and the aquifer which will involve a vertical dispersion driven by this density contrast models with and without density flow integration clearly show the need to consider the implications of this density contrast see fig 5 if the density flow effect is ignored the injected solutions remained in the production area as shown in the 2d sections of the sulfate concentrations modeled at t 200 days and t 6 years see fig 5 this is reflected in particular by the persistence of high modeled concentrations at the extraction well as illustrated by the changes in the sulfate ion concentration in the fig 5 concentration plateau at 0 198 mol l for 6 years against a rapid observed decrease to 9 6 10 3 mol l at t 6 years when the density flow effect is taken into account the concentrations of major cations also remain too high after the end of the test while the ph remains too low phwithout density flow 2 5 at t 6 years compared to phwith density flow 4 1 on the same date considering the density flow effect makes it possible to better represent the changes in sulfate ion concentrations both at the level of the extraction well see fig 5 and at environmental monitoring wells see fig 3 1 it should be noted that the isrz 0010 piezometer does not appear to capture the peak sulfate concentration and only records the decrease in concentrations which followed the piezometer was put into operation after the peak sulfate ion concentration had been reached thus the density contrast between the injected solution and the aquifer water has been sufficient to cause significant plunging of the salt plume after the end of operations as illustrated on the 2d sections of the sulfate concentrations modeled at t 200j and t 6 years in fig 5 the saline plume reaches the bottom of the reservoir approximately 7 months after the end of the isr test and then slowdowns this density flow effect contributes to the natural attenuation of the plume causing its dilution over the height of the exploited aquifer 5 2 importance of the cationic exchange reactions with clay minerals the migratory behaviour of trace elements such as uranium and 226ra is governed by the major elements through complexing reactions in solution co precipitation within the insoluble phases and cation exchange with clay minerals adsorption at the surface and also interlayer exchange in the case of smectite therefore it is necessary to ensure that the models allow the behaviour of the major cations ca mg na na k and protons through ph to be properly represented simulations with and without cation exchange reactions with clay minerals clearly show to what extent this mechanism controls the concentrations of major cations in water without cation exchange the water chemistry is governed only by the precipitation dissolution reactions of reactive paragenesis the main reactive minerals at the extraction well were uraninite 99 9 of the uraninite in place was dissolved at t 200 days 100 at t 6 years and calcite 100 of the calcite in place was dissolved at t 200 days in the non mineralized zone goethite was also reactive 6 of the goethite in place in the oxidized zone was dissolved at t 200 days 11 at t 6 years barite precipitated 396 at t 200 days 593 after 6 years allowing 226ra to co precipitate at the same time finally the concentrations of kaolinite montmorillonite ca cristobalite and microcline did not change during the six years of modeling the precipitation of secondary minerals was blocked their saturation indices showing systematically under saturation except for gypsum the issue of gypsum precipitation will be discussed at the end of this section these reactions effectively replicate the decrease in ph and the increase in major cation concentrations but not sufficiently to replicate the amplitudes observed in the monitoring data the ph decrease is relatively well represented regardless of whether the cation exchange mechanism ce with clay minerals is considered or not see fig 6 2 for the extraction well at the bottom of the curve ph without ce 1 33 ph with ce 1 35 phobserved 1 13 indicating that the major mechanism for controlling ph during the test is the dissolution of the reactive paragenesis including calcite dissolution however the shape of the ph curve once the test is completed can be seen to be very different depending on the mechanisms considered if sorption is disregarded the modeled ph rises rapidly above ph 6 at t 2 years and tend towards ph 7 at t 6 years while the monitoring data show a ph of around 4 that sets in from t 2 years and remains up to t 6 years in contrast the modeling which includes the cation exchange reactions does succeed in representing this ph at the level of the extraction well as well as the trends and amplitudes of the monitoring piezometers see fig 6 2 the slight discrepancies between the monitoring and the modeling data noted in the short term t 1 5 years for the isrz 0008 and isrz 0010 piezometers may most likely be explained by the simplification of the distribution of the permeable impermeable facies in addition the modeling of mg concentrations over time with consideration see fig s5 1 supplementary information and without consideration of the cationic exchange reactions see fig 6 2 shows the amplitude differences modeled without sorption the modeled magnesium concentration peaks were 9 10 3 mol l for isrp 0001 mg ref peak 2 1 10 2 mol l 8 5 10 3 mol l for isrz 0008 mg ref peak 3 0 10 2 mol l and 5 7 10 3 mol l for isrz 0010 mg ref peak 1 6 10 2 mol l respectively when sorption is considered these peaks are modeled at 2 1 10 2 mol l for isrp 0001 4 4 10 2 mol l for isrz 0008 and 3 5 10 2 mol l for isrz 0010 thus respecting both the magnitude and the trends of the environmental monitoring points the trends of the other major cations are respected but an amplitude problem arises ca concentrations are overestimated see fig s5 2 3 and 4 supplementary information due to the absence of gypsum precipitation no sulfate phase precipitation was observed on cored samples angileri et al 2020 this overestimation in solution results in a shift in the equilibrium of the sorbed cations which explains the discrepancies observed between modeling and observation gypsum precipitation could make it possible to better represent the changes in ca mg na and k concentrations particularly in terms of amplitude but does not allow the ph to be correctly modeled see fig s6 1 2 3 4 and 5 supplementary information which is a major limitation in the context of isr operations the main objective of these models is to correctly represent the behaviour of ph sulfate ions uranium and 226ra so it was decided not to allow gypsum to precipitate in the models despite the fact that the calcium and the sulfates in solution seem to be in equilibrium with the gypsum to illustrate the role of cation exchange with the clay minerals at the extraction well the distribution of the major cations and uranium between sorbed aqueous and solid phases is shown in fig s7 and s8 supplementary information these cations are initially distributed between the sorbed fraction 99 for the proton between 20 and 22 for ca mg and na 1 3 for k the aqueous phase 0 1 for ca mg h and k 79 for na and the solid phase between 78 and 99 of the total stock for ca mg k and h no solid phase for sodium and the protons uranium on the other hand is mainly in the solid phase 99 9 and in the water 0 1 as illustrated in fig s8 supplementary information the arrival of the salt and acid plume drives out the cations initially sorbed via cation exchange on clay minerals mainly ca and mg in favour of the protons see fig 7 at the end of the isr test there was no significant variation in the exchange capacity of the clay minerals present the sorbed major cation concentrations decreased concentrations expressed in eq l in na 91 mg 93 ca 86 and k 5 and the concentration of protons and uranium increased concentrations expressed in eq l in protons 300 uranium 268 300 leading to much higher concentrations in the water at the end of the test than initially for both major cations concentrations expressed in eq l as h multiplied by 1250 ca by 24 mg by 15 k by 18 and na by 1 4 than for the trace cations uranium concentration multiplied by 7 the stock of cations in the solid phase remained stable for potassium and magnesium no dissolution of the minerals carrying these cations decreased for ca dissolution of calcite leading to a 22 decrease in the stock of ca and uranium dissolution of uraninite leading to a 100 decrease in the stock of u as shown by robin et al 2017 and robin et al 2020 dissolution of clay minerals is negligible in acidic isr context even with such a high h rate of occupation once the isr test was completed the protons gradually returned into solution by ion exchange reactions with the cations of the uncontaminated groundwater thus maintaining a stable ph of around 4 in the production area as shown on the 2d distribution of the modeled ph at t 6 years in fig 6 3 after six years of modeling at the level of the extraction well isrp 0001 the distribution of cation stocks had changed 1 the sorbed stock was restructured a lower concentration in protons 26 compared to the end of the test an increase in sorbed sodium and potassium concentrations na 310 compared to the initial state k 64 compared to the initial state and a decrease in magnesium and sorbed calcium concentrations mg 81 compared to the initial state ca 57 compared to the initial state 2 the aqueous stock had decreased ca 99 with respect to the end of the test mg 100 with respect to the end of the test na 74 with respect to the end of the test k 98 from the end of the test u 100 from the end of the test and 3 the solid stock remained stable ca 78 of the initial stock stable since the end of the test mg 99 of the initial stock against 100 at the end of the test the impact on ph seems to be effectively restricted to the production cell and its close vicinity 10 m the lower ph values observed at the extraction and monitoring wells below the cell are thus stabilized by the presence of smectite type clay minerals and their cation exchange properties see fig 3 2 as long as all the protons have not been desorbed by the arrival of non impacted water linked to the natural flow of the aquifer the ph will remain between 4 and 5 in the production area 5 3 modeling makes it possible to represent the behaviour of trace elements such as uranium and 226ra the amplitude and trend of the peak uranium concentration at the extraction well is well reproduced by modeling considering the density flow and the sorption reactions of the clay minerals which show clearly that these are the two major mechanisms involved in the natural attenuation of uranium on the other hand the modeling showed an increase in uranium concentrations u tot modeled 5 10 5 mol l at t 2 years in the isrz 0010 piezometer while the measurements taken showed a stable concentration of around 2 10 8 mol l see fig 4 1 this difference is explained by several factors 1 the distribution of the mineralizations in the model was taken as homogeneous and constant whereas it is certain that in reality a spatial heterogeneity exists but is not known precisely at the scale of the modeled zone therefore this simplification was considered acceptable in view of the modeling objectives 2 due to numerical non convergence pyrite was not considered in the modeled system reducing conditions downstream of the mineralized zone were therefore not dictated by the pyrite leading to an underestimation of the aquifer s redox buffer capacities since uranium is mobile under oxidizing conditions reimus et al 2019 this configuration could explain an increased mobility of the modeled uranium finally 3 for the same reasons as for the distribution of the mineralizations the distribution of the permeable impermeable facies was somewhat simplified in our model yet impermeable screens play a crucial role in the lateral spreading of the plume perhaps causing this increase in modeled concentrations concerning 226ra as stated above only the production well was modeled to avoid the effects of gravity flows present for the other piezometers as illustrated in fig s4 supplementary information the modeling of 226ra concentrations in production solutions is not representative of the monitoring data if only the cation exchange mechanism is considered 226ra modeled hytec 1116 bq l at t 30 days versus 226 ra observed 75 bq l at t 40 days it is necessary to add the co precipitation in the barite to correctly model the behaviour of 226ra and thus obtain a modeled peak at 94 bq l at t 30 days the stabilization of 226ra concentrations around 10 bq l is related to the moderately acidic conditions imposed by the sorption on clay minerals for ph values below 4 5 the proton is the majority component in the sum of sorbed cations so 226ra sorption was not observed however co precipitation in barite is not affected by ph which explains the 10 bq l range above ph 4 the clay minerals deprotonate and 226ra sorption reduces their concentrations to background levels in conclusion based on the modeling and monitoring data acquired in this test natural attenuation was observed for the main markers of isr solutions namely ph sulfate uranium and 226ra concentrations and is based on many mechanisms such as dilution of the salt plume cation exchange with the clay minerals and coprecipitation within minerals such as barite a future consideration of the reduction of metals a mechanism that was not included in this study due to numerical convergence issues using different approaches microbial activity presence of minerals with high reducing power such as pyrite will certainly eliminate some of the artifacts observed in this study particularly concerning uranium 5 4 effect of cell size the problem of the mesh cell size for the modeling is both related to the computation time the finer the mesh the longer the computations will be and to how representative it is to the heterogeneities of the aquifer the coarser the mesh the more the heterogeneities are smoothed or positioned approximately in order to evaluate the effect of this parameter a modeling with a mesh consisting of 4950 cells of dimensions 4 m 4 m see fig s9 supplementary information over the same area as the reference mesh 78 000 cells of 1 m 1 m was performed this cell size was closer to the one used to model the functioning of isr production lagneau et al 2019 as expected the modeling with 4950 cells progressed much faster than with 78 000 cells 25 min against 15 5 h with identical geochemistry the change of cell size does not drastically impact the modeling of the extraction well but the monitoring piezometers were less well modeled with a coarser mesh notably isrz 0010 see fig 8 1 2 and 3 the extraction well is generally well represented because the distribution of uranium at its level is well known and homogeneous core deposit and there is no major impermeable interlayer the increase in cell size therefore does not affect the model s validity however once outside the operating area heterogeneities seem to play a stronger role in the changes in ph and the uranium and sulfate concentrations the plume dive at the isrz 0008 piezometer located directly below the production cell is well represented during production but the decrease in sulfate concentrations is underestimated by the model so4 total modeled 6 4 10 2 mol l at t 6 years versus so4 total observed 1 7 10 2 mol l at the same date at the level of the isrz 0013 well no increase in sulfate concentration is modeled however it was observed the cell size here implies a too large numerical dilution of the plume laterally the modeling of the isrz 0010 piezometer shows an overall overestimation of sulfate and uranium concentrations and a ph too low modeled ph 4 against observed ph 6 at t 6 years the salt plume seems to arrive too concentrated and put uranium in solution in contrast with the reality two phenomena explain this the cell size requires 1 further smoothing of the uranium distribution and 2 a coarser representation of the permeable impermeable facies thus to correctly represent the post operations changes at short time intervals of the contaminants of interest it is necessary to be sufficiently representative of the heterogeneities uranium distribution distribution of clay interlayers and therefore to use a relatively fine mesh however 2d modeling is sufficient where in production it is necessary to use a much more complex 3d model lagneau et al 2019 6 conclusions the dulaan uul isr test shows that it is feasible to implement a modeling approach combining the production 200 days and post production up to 6 years after the start of the test phases the available data show an impact currently limited to the zone directly below the production cell and its near vicinity 10 m the ph stabilized at around 4 in the production area itself and around 5 5 below the cell the sulfate ions were mainly diluted by the plume plunging down into the aquifer the uranium and 226ra illustrate that natural attenuation is taking place uranium concentrations in water fell to background levels two years after the end of the test and 226ra concentrations were never as high as expected about 10 of the expected value is observed at the extraction well isrp 0001 those values were observed at an isr test scale and cannot be directly extended when upscaling to an industrial exploitation scale lagneau et al 2019 mining operations in this case govern strongly the plume distances and expected duration for natural attenuation the modeling of this isr test and associated environmental monitoring reveals four parameters necessary for a good representation of the changes in ph and the concentrations of sulfate uranium and 226ra i density flow ii cation exchanges with clay minerals iii co precipitation of 226ra with barite and iv model mesh dimensions for correctly accounting hydrogeological heterogeneities due to the difference in density between the injection solutions and the aquifer water it is necessary to consider the density flow for a good representation of the behaviour of sulfate ions the major mechanism affecting the ph is cation exchange on clay minerals the rapid decrease in ph during the timespan of operations modifies the distribution of exchangeable cations with the protons occupying up to 89 of the available exchange sites once the isr test was completed the protons gradually returned to solution by ion exchange reactions with the cations of the uncontaminated groundwater thus creating a stable ph of around 4 in the production area concerning the behaviour of 226ra the key mechanism at work is co precipitation within the barite making it possible to capture about 90 of the radium released when the injection solutions arrive this mechanism was not implemented in the hytec version used in this study so the changes in 226ra behaviour were only modeled at the scale of the extraction well isrp 0001 finally it is highlighted that the representation of the heterogeneities from a hydrogeological point of view distribution of permeabilities in particular as much as a geological distribution of oxidized mineralized and reduced zones requires a sufficiently fine mesh 1 m 1 m cells without requiring the use of 3d models that would drastically increase the need for

1471,the soil gas concentration attenuation in lateral diffusive transport determines the influence area of a contamination plume in soil vapor intrusion a major exposure pathway of volatile chemicals at contaminated sites in this study we utilize both physical and mathematical models to investigate the roles of soil geology heterogeneities and impermeable surface pavements in determining the attenuation of contaminant soil gas concentration the results indicate that the attenuation of soil gas concentration with lateral diffusion is observed to be the most significant if with a low permeability soil layer at the bottom and a high permeability layer on top followed by the cases with the uniform soil properties and the lateral attenuation is the least significant in cases with a high permeability soil layer at the bottom and a low permeability soil layer on top regardless of the surface coverage compared to soil heterogeneity the influences of surface conditions are less significant and the capping effect of surface cover can only play a role in determining shallow soil gas concentration profiles at last the physical experimental results were used to examine a

flux soil surface cover can decrease the soil gas concentration attenuation in the lateral diffusive transport such impermeable surface cover could be concrete pavements asphalted road or even high moisture content soil layer after rainfall events shen et al 2012 yao et al in 2015 further developed a model to include layering and surface cover in vi from a distant source however these literatures did not include the influences of both soil heterogeneity and surface conditions in evaluating vi risks to address this issue in this study we utilize a physical scale model to improve the understanding of the soil gas concentration attenuation in cases involving layering and impermeable soil covers the observed soil gas concentration profiles are compared with the numerical results and then used to study the soil gas concentration attenuation in vertical and lateral diffusive transport respectively at last the experimental results were employed to validate an existing analytical vi model to include the influences of soil heterogeneity and surface conditions in evaluating risks from a laterally separated vapor source 2 methods 2 1 the laboratory experiment a 2 d soil tank made of plexiglass with w h d 1 8 m 0 58 m 0 2 m was used to experiment fig 1 the target chemical i e tce 99 was obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent company wang et al 2019 after dissolution and agitation the immobile source of soil gas was introduced to a container at the lower left corner of the tank to simulate a scenario where the vapor source is 0 58 m deep below the ground surface the average measured tce concentration in the source zone was about 20 to 40 mg lvapor the concentration α soil gas concentration concentration at source was employed to study the soil gas concentration profiles it should be noticed that in the 2 d soil tank we assumed there were fluxes in the 2 dimensions rather than 3 dimensions and the soil gas concentration in this situation might be overestimated the soil tank was filled with porous mediums sand sandy soil and clay table 1 obtained from the surface soil layer at the zijingang campus of zhejiang university before filling the soil tank these mediums were dried for 24 h at 80 c and sieved to establish the particle size distributions to facilitate precise packing the soil was filled and packed at a 0 02 m increment in the tank to keep the only gas phase of contaminant within the domain a porous baffle of teflon was placed on the source and a film of teflon was placed on the inner surface the teflon film was also placed on the soil surface to simulate impermeable surface cover the time to reach a steady state was estimated with eq 1 little et al 1992 where d e is the effective vapor diffusion coefficient m2 s which could be estimated according to the eq 2 millington and quirk 1961 r is the retardation factor θ g is the air filled porosity l is the lateral distance from the edge of the contaminant source m which is 1 64 m in this experiment r can be estimated according to eq 3 1 exp d e π 2 t r θ g l 2 0 1 2 d e d g θ g 10 3 θ t 2 d w h i θ w 10 3 θ t 2 3 r θ g θ w h k d ρ b h θ g where θ w is the moisture filled porosity which is the moisture remaining after oven drying h is henry s law s constant of the chemical ρ b is the bulk density of the soil g cm3 k d is the soil sorption coefficient cm3 g and can be estimated according to eq 4 little et al 1992 4 k d k d sat h s w h where s w is the soil moisture content volume per gram soil cm3 g k d sat is the water saturated sorption coefficient cm3 g based on the parameters shown in table 2 the retardation factors of sand sandy soil and clay can be approximated as 1 2 5 and 4 5 respectively and the time to reach a steady state can be calculated as 1 5 7 6 and 27 3 days for sand sandy soil and clay cases respectively thus a month is enough for the establishment of near steady state conditions after the vapor source was introduced the soil gas samples were not collected until half a month later for uniform soil cases and 27 days for non uniform soil cases from the 36 sampling ports in the sidewall of the soil tank before and after sample collections those sampling ports were sealed with teflon films soil gas samples were collected by 1 μl micro injector and then analyzed directly on a shimadzu 2010 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column db 624 agilent 30 m 0 53 mm i d film thickness 3 0 μm two probe volumes were removed before the samples were collected the concentration profile of soil gas was generated based on the measured concentrations at various locations there were three sampling events for each sampling port and the results were averaged 2 2 numerical model a finite element based comsol multiphysics was applied to solve the governing equation with boundary conditions in this study bozkurt 2009 chiao et al 1994 pennell et al 2009 shen et al 2013 yao et al 2011 yao et al 2017b the soil gas continuity equation can be written 5 d e i c g 0 where c g is the contaminant vapor concentration mol m3 d e i is the effective vapor diffusion coefficient m2 s in i layer from the bottom for simplicity the model assumes that there is only the gas phase of the contaminant within the transport domain variable grid sizes and time steps were allowed in this program with the time steps being adjusted automatically the immobile napl non aqueous phase liquid is employed as the source detailed parameters are listed in table 2 the boundary conditions are shown in fig 1 and table 3 the source is located at the lower left corner of the domain and the soil gas transport in both horizontal and vertical directions is simulated the soil gas concentrations of tce at the ground surface assumed to be their atmospheric concentration is generally approximated to be 0 no flux boundary conditions are assigned at the surface cover the lateral boundaries and the bottom 2 3 simulated scenarios in this study seven scenarios are simulated and they can be divided into three groups table 4 the first involves homogeneous soil and the absence of surface cover i the second includes heterogeneous soil and the absence of surface cover ii iii the last is the case with heterogeneous soil and partially paved soil surface iv v vi vii in cases examining the role of soil heterogeneity in soil gas transport different horizontal soil layers are applied and details about soil layers are shown in fig 2 to study the capping effect of surface covers at different locations two kinds of surface covers are employed as shown in fig 3 one is composed of a single but large pavement while the other is composed of two smaller pavements of the same size the space between the two pavements is 0 25 m details about the surface conditions are shown in table 2 the laboratory experiments and the numerical simulations were performed to study these scenarios and the results of soil gas concentration profiles were compared 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulated soil gas concentration profiles fig 4 shows a comparison between the normalized soil gas concentration profiles simulated with physical and numerical models for scenarios involving layering and surface barriers in general the predicted results with the numerical model are within one order of magnitude of the experimental results as for the influences of the soil layer arrangement the highest soil gas concentration profiles in the shallow zone are observed in the cases of heterogeneous b followed by the cases with homogenous soils and the lowest are those of heterogeneous a regardless of the surface conditions such results are not difficult to understand as the escape of contaminant soil gas through the open surface is prohibited if with a soil layer of low permeability on top and vice versa also the low diffusivity in the bottom layer can increase the soil gas concentration difference between the source zone and the shallow zone as a result the soil gas concentration at the top right in case iii is higher than that in case ii by about 2 3 orders of magnitude such observations are in line with previous studies for example the 3 d mathematical model simulations in an epa technical document suggested the concentration distribution of soil gas was influenced by the presence and position of different soil layers in which such barrier layers could induce a sharp concentration change with up to an order of magnitude decrease in concentrations abreu and schuver 2012 like the low permeability layer on the ground surface the ground cover can also induce a similar capping effect to prevent the soil gas from escaping but the size of ground cover is usually limited compared to that of a soil layer the increase in soil gas concentrations are not so significant compared to that with a low permeability layer on top when the low permeability layer is close to the vapor source the capping effect of the surface cover is less significant than that with a low permeability layer at the top the results also indicate that the distribution of the surface barriers is not crucial in determining the soil gas concentration profiles as long as the total sizes are similar these findings support a claim by yao et al 2015 that the attenuation of soil gas concentration was decreased with the presence of surface cover and its size and the influences of surface cover were dependent on the soil geology moreover a comprehensive field study carried by bekele et al 2014 showed the impervious cover might cause higher tce concentrations of soil gas underneath sub slab or asphalt coverings 3 2 the attenuation of soil gas concentration in the vertical direction to further investigate the roles of soil heterogeneity and surface conditions in determining soil gas concentration attenuation in vertical transport fig 5 was generated to show the relationship between normalized soil gas concentration and vertical distance above the vapor source the lateral distance and the vertical distance from the vapor source are normalized to the vertical distance between the vapor source and soil surface the normalized lateral distance is the ratio of the lateral distance of the depth of contaminant source below the surface and the normalized vertical distance is the ratio of the vertical distance from the vapor source to the depth of the vapor source the points represent measurements from the physical experiments while the lines refer to the numerical results the plots in fig 5 include data with different lateral distances from the source edge the results suggest that the surface cover plays a less significant role in the soil gas concentration attenuation during vertical soil gas transport compared to soil heterogeneity the surface barrier can increase the shallow soil gas concentration below the cover but such influences disappear quickly when it is deeper those observations are in line with pennell et al 2016 whose results showed that soil gas was trapped beneath the entire covered area while soil gas concentrations outside the covered area decreased as it approached the open surface in cases with homogenous soil the soil gas concentration decreases with the vertical diffusion distance from the source while in layering cases a more significant vertical variation in soil gas concentration could be observed in the clay layer than that in the sand or sandy soil layer the results suggest that soil heterogeneity can increase or decrease the vertical soil gas concentration variation by half those experimental observations are in line with previous field and simulation studies davis et al 2005 conducted static depth profile monitoring for a layered sandy vadose zone and found that the retentive layer seemingly had a dramatic effect on the depth distribution of hydrocarbon vapors johnson et al 1999 concluded that larger concentration differences are expected across regions with finer grained soils in layered settings mchugh and mcalary 2009 also reported that a fine grained soil layer in the vadose zone prevented the vertical migration of vocs if it was laterally continuous the experimental results also suggested that the impact of soil layers is determined by their location relative to the source and the surface the total vertical diffusion coefficient in the case of heterogeneous a is the same as that of heterogeneous b while a more significant variation of soil gas concentration in the case of heterogeneous b 3 3 the attenuation of soil gas concentration in the lateral direction fig 6a and fig 6b shows the influences of the lateral transport distance on the soil gas in the shallow and the deep soil respectively similar to the results shown in fig 5 soil heterogeneity plays a more significant role in determining lateral attenuation of soil gas concentration than the partial ground cover when the low permeability layer is at the bottom heterogeneity a the general soil gas concentration is quite low and reduces quickly with lateral diffusion distance in both shallow and deep soil mchugh et al 2013 evaluated the impacts of soil characteristics on vocs attenuation from sources to deep soil gas and found sites with fine grained soils at the water table exhibit an average of 500 times more attenuation of vocs when the low permeability layer is on the top heterogeneity b the general soil gas concentration profile is relatively higher and the soil gas concentration decreases less significantly with lateral diffusion distance in both shallow and deep soil soil heterogeneity can increase the lateral variation in soil gas concentration by 3 times or decrease it by 2 3 in the shallow soil the surface cover can increase the soil gas concentration by more than 1 order of magnitude while in the deep soil the soil gas concentrations tend to decrease exponentially with lateral diffusion distance independent of surface conditions such a phenomenon is in agreement with previous modeling studies lowell and eklund 2004 yao et al 2014 2015 3 4 examining the analytical model vi models involve two groups yao et al 2013 one group includes the multidimensional numerical models capable of simulating complicated environmental processes while the others are analytical models applied as simple screening tools to estimate the vapor intrusion potential for vapor source distant from the concerned building the risk screening tool must include the influences of soil heterogeneity and surface conditions here we introduce an analytical model aamlph analytical approximation method involving lateral soil gas transport paved ground surface and heterogeneous soil developed by yao et al in 2015 based on a conformal transform technique this model is to estimate subslab soil gas concentration in vi scenarios involving surface impermeable pavements and layering readers interested in more details of the model are directed to the original reference fig 7 shows a comparison between the results of the aamlph and the tce soil gas concentrations measured in the physical experiment the solid line is the 45 line showing where ideal agreement with the reality would be observed in general the majority of the predictions by the aamlph fall within one order of magnitude of the results from the experiment and the predictions tend to be more conservative than the experimental observations these results confirm that aamlph can capture the key characteristics of vi scenarios including soil heterogeneity and surface cover 4 conclusions this work is an extension of our previous study where laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were performed for cases with homogeneous soils in the current study we extend the research focus to include scenarios involving layering and surface barrier the results indicate that the soil heterogeneity could significantly affect the soil gas concentration profiles in the cases with a 0 3 m thick sand layer at the top 0 2 m sandy soil layer in the middle and 0 08 m thick clay soil layer at the bottom the soil gas concentration at the upper right corner x 1 8 m and z 0 58 m is lower than that with homogenous soil by about 1 order of magnitude while the vertical and lateral variations in soil gas concentration profiles in the former cases are higher by half and 3 times respectively in the cases with a 0 08 m thick clay soil layer at the top 0 2 m thick sandy soil layer in the middle and 0 3 m thick sand layer at the bottom the soil gas concentration at the upper right corner is higher than that with homogenous soil by about 1 order of magnitude while the vertical and lateral variations in soil gas concentration profiles in the former cases are lower by half and 2 3 respectively compared to the influences of soil texture heterogeneity the role of the surface impermeable barrier is limited in this study partly because the size of the surface barrier is not so extensive as the soil layer in this study the ground cover can increase the soil gas concentration in the shallow zone by more than 1 order of magnitude while the influences are significant in the deep soil the observed results in the experiment were also used to examine an analytical model aamlph to include both surface conditions and layering the comparison indicates the predictions are more conservative than the observations and the differences are within one order of magnitude in most cases declaration of

1471,the soil gas concentration attenuation in lateral diffusive transport determines the influence area of a contamination plume in soil vapor intrusion a major exposure pathway of volatile chemicals at contaminated sites in this study we utilize both physical and mathematical models to investigate the roles of soil geology heterogeneities and impermeable surface pavements in determining the attenuation of contaminant soil gas concentration the results indicate that the attenuation of soil gas concentration with lateral diffusion is observed to be the most significant if with a low permeability soil layer at the bottom and a high permeability layer on top followed by the cases with the uniform soil properties and the lateral attenuation is the least significant in cases with a high permeability soil layer at the bottom and a low permeability soil layer on top regardless of the surface coverage compared to soil heterogeneity the influences of surface conditions are less significant and the capping effect of surface cover can only play a role in determining shallow soil gas concentration profiles at last the physical experimental results were used to examine a

anning river basin from 1971 to 2017 at the same time the month of typical precipitation i e the largest annual average precipitation was identified a model of runoff and sediment over two stations from 2010 to 2015 were constructed respectively based on copula analysis method synchronous and asynchronous probabilities of runoff and sediment were analysed from the temporal and spatial aspects separately the encounter probabilities of runoff and sediment over multiple periods and at two stations were analysed the sediment distribution was illustrated under multiple runoff distribution conditions the encounter probability of runoff and sediment distribution changed greatly which was principally due to employment of reservoir operation soil and water conservation measures the

sediment are of importance to many rivers across the world yan et al 2011 dong et al 2014 ewane and lee 2017 runoff and sediment are highly interdependent leading to a close relationship between the two factors within any specific river basin matthew et al 2011 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 ngo et al 2015 ni et al 2019 at the same time they are of significance to water resources utilization water related project safety maintenance and watershed sustainable development tan et al 2013 gopal et al 2015 boluwade and madramootoo 2017 trinh et al 2017 ho et al 2019 obviously flux dynamics and the associated interactions of runoff and sediment have multiple implications and are an important basis for flood control water resource utilization and water conservancy infrastructure planning tan et al 2011 tian et al 2015 in particular investigation and analysis of the runoff and sediment nexus under changing environmental conditions can provide a theoretical basis for water and soil erosion control ecological restoration and disaster prevention tan et al 2010 nigam et al 2017 this is of increasing concern to both research and management communities however nexus processes of runoff and sediments in rivers are extremely complicated involving a number of interactive parameters and procedures the complexity of the corresponding dual processes of runoff and sediment is enormously magnified posing great challenges to decision makers and watershed managers therefore it is desired to identify and analyse relationships of runoff and sediment previously many studies were undertaken to analyse the nexus between runoff and sediment they mainly focused on external factors such as climatic conditions e g precipitation and human activities e g construction and operation of water conservancy projects on runoff and sediment yielding mechanism as well as the associated reduction and controlling measures ahmadisharaf et al 2020 for example the runoff and sediment nexus is concerned to water and soil resource management wang et al 2015 in recent years relevant research was conducted on variations in runoff and sediment depositions gao et al 2013 ye et al 2014 guo et al 2017 quantified runoff and sediment nexus under natural rainfall events with diverse land disturbances and plot lengths in order to compare soil and water losses from multiple plots meanwhile the relationship between sediment yield and rainfall intensity was described xia et al 2017 examined changing trends of runoff and sediment yields from 1981 to 2012 in the yanwachuan watershed and analysed the measures resulting in runoff variations and sediment reduction systematically at the same time the precipitation changes and soil and water conservation measures on runoff and sediment yields were evaluated wu et al 2012 investigated the impacts of surface runoff and sediment contents on the characteristics of n and p losses and explored the effects of contributing factors on runoff and sediments peña angulo et al 2019 analysed the relationships between precipitation runoff sediment yield and soil erosion with multiple weather conditions throughout the mediterranean basin hu et al 2019 explored the relationships between the sediment yield and predominated hydrologic variables under multiple flooding patterns in the loess plateau where located in the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river of northwest china however the relationship between runoff and sediment was quantified in relatively simply ways and their complex relationship were explored by limited number of researchers in the past decades copula functions were utilized in many areas e g hydrology energy and finance goodwin and hungerford 2014 liu et al 2017a 2017b grimaldi et al 2016 cubillos rocha et al 2019 because copula function can accurately deal with nonlinear asymmetric correlations and allow a variety of marginal distributions li et al 2017 nadal romero et al 2015 tan et al 2017 for instance combination of copula function and risk analysis was used to quantify the interaction of water and energy resources systems cai et al 2019 the copula functions were used to establish the joint probability distribution function of runoff and tn tp concentration to improve the accuracy of miyun reservoir water quality risk prediction wang et al 2017 previously copula functions were widely used in recent years to analyse the synchronous asynchronous joint probability of hydrological variables it was explored that synchronous asynchronous joint probability of rich low precipitation in the middle route of south to north water diversion in china yan and chen 2013 copula functions were used in constructing bivariate runoff distributions to calculate the joint probability distribution then encounter probability on runoff of the jinsha river and its tributary yalong river was explored lei et al 2018 however few researchers used copula functions to analyse the nexus of runoff and sediment guo et al 2016 and zhang et al 2014 analysed the synchronous asynchronous joint probabilities of rich poor runoff and sediment discharge in weihe basin although they introduced a flexible and appropriate copula function to develop a runoff and sediment model less attention to the occurrences of these results in this research a modelling approach for river runoff and sediment nexus analysis under multiple flows will be constructed the anning river basin a hyper sediment concentrated river of southwest china will be employed as the demonstrative river it is the economic development centre of the region including the second largest barn in sichuan province due to the concentrated and intensive rainfall and soil loose the landslide debris flow occurs frequently which makes the anning river basin hyper concentrated sediment in southwest china therefore it is important to consider the runoff and sediment nexus and deeply analyse the relationships between runoff and sediment in the watershed the following tasks will be undertaken a analysis of the historical long term surface rainfall change trend b introduce a copula function to construct the joint distribution model of runoff and sediment c analysis of encounter probabilities of multiple water flow conditions the following innovations are associated with the research including a the complex interactions between runoff and sediment will be quantified in a river of high sediment concentration and b encounter probabilities of runoff and sediment will be analysed from the view of temporal spatial aspect 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the study area the anning river with a mainstream length of 326 km is the largest tributary in the lower reach of the yalong river the largest tributary of the jinsha river the anning river fig 1 with a drainage area of 11 150 km2 locates in the transitional zone of the qinghai tibet plateau the yunnan kwei chow plateau and the sichuan basin this transitional zone is an important ecological barrier in the upper reach of the yangtze river and plays a significant role in the ecological security maintenance of sichuan province zhang et al 2019a b c d anning valley is the second largest valley plain in sichuan province shao et al 2013 the terrain has obvious differences in the study area ma et al 2018 the topography of the study area is high in the north and the west at the same time it is low in the south and the east with an elevation of 900 to 4750 m the anning river basin is characterized by concentrated rainfall with high intensity sparse soil and frequent landslide debris flow ni et al 2019 the average annual precipitation is 1133 mm it is rainy from may to october every year which accounts for over 90 of the total precipitation and the precipitation in mountainous areas is more than that in the adjacent valleys the maximum flood peaks mostly occur in july and august shao et al 2013 the annual sediment contents of wantan station which is the outlet reach 1 44 kg m3 the average annual sediment discharge is 8 98 million tons of wantan station there are two hydrological stations above the irrigation area in the middle reaches of the anning river basin namely lugu lg and sunshuiguan ssg lg station locates in the upstream of the anning river basin the daqiao dq reservoir was built approximately 40 km away at present the sediment content of the section is monitored only in flooding season the average sediment content in the flood season is 360 g m3 lan et al 2017 in detail ssg station locates in the outlet of sunshui river which is the largest tributary on the right bank of the upper reaches of the anning river the precipitation data used in this research was established from china meteorological data service center cmdc which is an authoritative sharing platform supported by china meteorological administration cma the meteorological data was derived from a daily database and the record period was from 1971 to 2017 nine meteorology stations were selected from cmdc databases for this research the daily runoff data r and daily sediment data s of the two stations i e lg ssg were collected from annual hydrological report 2 2 methodology rainfall change dominated the variation in runoff in the jinsha river basin and it also had a significant impact on the sediment conditions rainfall is the main source of runoff and the main cause of sediment production puntenney desmond et al 2020 monitoring and analysis of rainfall changes in the jinsha river basin could provide a scientific basis for the study of runoff and sediment variation trends lu et al 2019 therefore long series of precipitation data are used to confirm the mutation point in addition runoff and sediment nexus analysis rsna model is established including a correlation analysis of runoff and sediment b establishment of marginal probability distributions of runoff and sediment separately c construction of the joint probability distribution between runoff and sediment and d synchronous asynchronous probability setting of runoff and sediment details of the methodology of this research is shown in fig 2 2 2 1 determination of mutation point many researchers men et al 2020 showed that tyson polygon method is an accurate method for calculating surface rainfall it is suitable for the case of uneven distribution of precipitation or rainfall stations in the basin in this research the rainfall data of the stations was transformed into surface data from 1971 to 2017 based on tyson polygon method which was used for the long term analysis of the precipitation in the anning river basin in the current research the non parametric mann kendall statistical test was applied to detect the precipitation trends iqbal and athar 2017 it is effective to figure out the datasets with irregular and missing samples because it does not require the source data fit any statistical distribution and disturbed by a few outliers um et al 2017 the s statistic in this test can be defined by eq 1 1 s k i 1 k r i k 2 3 n where r i can be described as follows 2 r i 1 x i x j 0 x i x j 1 2 i where s k is the cumulative number that the value at the moment i is greater than the number of values at the moment j define statistics under the assumption that the time series are random and independent 3 uk 1 s k e s k var s k k 1 2 n where uk 1 0 e s k and var s k are mean and variance of s k when x 1 x 2 x n are independent of each other and has the same continuous distribution they can be calculated by the following formula 4 e s k k k 1 4 var s k k k 1 2 k 5 72 k 2 3 n uf k is a standard normal distribution which is a series of statistics calculated in time series then reverse the time sequence and repeat the above process ub k uf k k n n 1 1 ub 1 0 given a significance level α such as α 0 05 critical value u 0 05 1 96 when there are multiple mutation points the mk test and sliding t test cooperate to identify mutation points the moving t test method is now widely used to detect the jump phenomena of climate in time series by analyzing the significant difference between the average values of paired samples liang et al 2013 the statistic in this test can be defined in eq 5 5 t x 1 x 2 s 1 n 1 1 n 2 where for the time series x with sample n set a certain time as the reference point artificially the sample sizes of the two subsequences x 1 and x 2 before and after the reference point are n 1 and n 2 the average of the two subsequences is x 1 and x 2 respectively and the variances are s 1 2and s 2 2 s n 1 s 1 2 n 2 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 distribution subject to degree of freedom γ n 1 n 2 2 2 2 2 development of a runoff sediment nexus analysis rsna model the first step is to characterize the correlation structure of the available samples and determine the correlation between runoff and sediment transport can help to select the optimal copula pearson γ kendall τ and spearman ρ are frequently used to determine the magnitude of the correlation the second step is to identify the marginal distributions between runoff and sediment which entails a selection of an appropriate type of edge distribution functions b estimation of the parameters of the edge distribution function and c test the goodness of fit to determine the optimal univariate edge distribution based on five common distribution forms i e normal lognormal weibull gamma and expedition the maximum likelihood method or moment matching estimation method were used to fit the edge distributions the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic statistical indicators are the smallest and the kolmogorov smirnov test ks test is used to finally select the most suitable edge distribution function the marginal distribution types of runoff and sediment are determined the aic can be expressed as 6 aic 2 k 2 ln l where k the number of model parameters l likelihood function similarly the bic can be given by 7 bic kln n 2 ln l where k the number of model parameters n the sample size l likelihood function the ks test statistic can be defined as 8 z max 1 l n f n x l f 0 x l where n the sample size f n x l the actual distribution of sample data f 0 x l the theoretical distribution of sample data the third step is to construct a coupled model between runoff and sediment discharge which entails a selection of the appropriate copula function type i e gaussian copula student t copula clayton copula gumbel copula frank copula joe copula b estimation of unknown parameters in the copula function and c fitting goodness test to determine the optimal multivariable joint distribution function the choice of the best fitting copula is selected through the aic standard and bic standard and the ks test identifies the appropriate copula based on sklar s theorem if h is a joint distribution function with marginal distributions r and s and these marginal distributions are continuous a single copula function c exists then the copula function can be defined as follows 9 h x y c r x s y x y r where h a joint distribution function with marginal cumulative distribution functions cdfs c a copula and r x and s y are distribution functions the forth step is to set the probability of rich poor encounters since the guarantee rate based on the standard of rich poor is higher than the probability it needs to be converted into a cumulative probability the probability of runoff and sediment is divided into three states rich normal and poor by the probability method with pr 37 5 and pk 62 5 as the probability of the division of runoff and sediment the combination of the rich poor encounters includes the following nine cases table 1 3 results 3 1 analysis of the mutation point this study extracts daily data of precipitation from nine meteorology stations in the anning river basin and compute inter annual precipitation data for the missing data we use interpolation to supplement the regression method is supplemented the mann kendall method was used to detect the change trend and mutation of the annual precipitation series in the anning river basin at a given significance level α 0 05 fig 3a the results show that there are three mutation points in the study time scale indicating that the precipitation in the basin has a significant increase or decrease in a certain period however because the mann kendall method cannot determine the occurrence of multiple intersection points the auxiliary sliding t test is used to determine the precipitation in the two places when the sliding t test is performed the step size n1 n2 2 15 is taken and the precipitation data are subjected to the mutation test fig 3b the results show that the precipitation slip statistics of the anning river basin pass the significance test when the step size is 8 and the other step sizes do not result in statistics that pass the significance test therefore the significant precipitation is in 2006 by calculating the average monthly precipitation from 1971 to 2017 we know that july has the highest average monthly precipitation in this research july is selected as the typical month 3 2 analysis of runoff sediment nexus patterns according to the developed rsna model the pearson γ kendall τ and spearman ρ are used to present the correlation of runoff and sediment which can illuminate the relevance between runoff and sediment the results of correlation coefficients are shown in table 2 from the table 2 it can be seen that the three correlation coefficients of lg station are all greater than 0 3 from 2010 to 2015 it indicates that runoff and sediment of lg station has medium or above correlation similarly the correlation coefficients of ssg station in 2010 2012 2013 2015 are medium or above however in 2011 τ is 0 04 and ρ is 0 01 which indicate that runoff and sediment has weak correlation γ 0 58 is greater than 0 3 which indicates runoff and sediment in 2011 has medium correlation in 2014 γ is 0 82 that means the strong correlation the τ is 0 27 that means the weak correlation and ρ is 0 38that means the medium correlation thus there exists interdependence between runoff and sediment in lg station and ssg station next it s significant to find the optimal marginal distribution function of runoff and sediment afterwards evaluate the goodness of the results the five common distribution functions and ks test method is applied for goodness of fit test the results are shown in table s1 s12 it can be concluded that the lognormal distribution has a better fitting and pass the significance test p 0 05 therefore it is appropriate to use the lognormal marginal distributions of runoff and sediment then it s indispensable to choose the appropriate copula function to establish the joint distribution of rsna and assess the goodness of fitting the best fitting copula is chosen between the archimedean copula and the oval copula using the aic standard bic standard and the ks test the ks statistic and p value indicate that the three adopted archimedean copulas in each period can pass the ks test and are available for describing the joint probability distribution of the bivariate random variables r and s from table 3 the parameters in copula functions are listed the joe copula function is suitable for the establishment of runoff and sediment nexus model in any year and also pass the significant test p 0 05 in ssg station however the daily scale rsna model of lg station in 2010 2014 and 2015 are joe copula function gumbel copula function is optimal in 2011 and 2012 in 2013 the gaussian copula is selected next it is the joint distribution probability analysis a 3d map of the runoff and sediment joint distribution shows the probability of runoff and sediment transport in different years of the flood season the probability of various encounter events is illustrated based on the contour map of the joint distribution a 3d map of the runoff and sediment joint distribution and the contour map of the joint distribution are shown in figs 4 and 5 analyse of the synchronous asynchronous probability according to the abovementioned rsna model studying the encounters of runoff and sediment in the anning river basin from both temporal spatial perspectives after calculation the results of the analysis of runoff and sediment rich poor encounters above the irrigation area of the anning river are obtained in table 4 3 3 runoff sediment encounter probability analysis for stations the synchronous probability in ssg station is generally lower than that of lg station on the contrary the asynchronous probability in the ssg station is higher than that of lg station i e 2010 2011 2012 2014 fig 6 for instance in 2012 the synchronous probability of runoff and sediment is 67 13 in lg station and is 53 54 in ssg station the probabilities of rich rich in lg station and ssg station respectively are 31 95 and 21 56 the poor normal probabilities of asynchronous probability in two stations are respectively 17 61 and 12 37 in 2012 the synchronous probability of the lg station was 66 80 while that of ssg station is 59 89 the maximum rich rich probability of the lg station is 35 45 accounting for 53 1 and in the ssg station the maximum synchronous probability is 28 91 among the asynchronous probability of runoff and sediment the maximum probability of rich normal in lg station is 1179 and the maximum probability of normal poor in ssg station is 9 84 in 2013 and 2015 the synchronous probability of the lg station was lower than that of the ssg station in 2013 ssg station s rich rich probability was highest at 44 48 but lg station s rich rich probability was 23 60 in 2015 the asynchronous probability is 43 25 as well as the asynchronous probability is 33 35 the normal rich and poor rich account for the greatest proportion of the asynchronous probability of lg station which are 11 78 and 10 41 respectively the maximum poor normal of ssg station is 9 15 in asynchronous probability the results show that the soil and water conservation and runoff and sediment regulation in the upper anning river are better than those in sunshui river 3 4 runoff sediment encounter probability analysis over the 6 year period at the same hydrological station the synchronous probability of runoff and sediment is greater than the asynchronous probability of runoff and sediment indicating that runoff and sediment are consistent in the six year flood season of lg station fig 7 the synchronous probability is greater than the asynchronous probability among the synchronous frequencies the rich rich scenario is more common especially in 2011 the probability of poor poor is36 77 accounting for 73 50 of the synchronous probability in 2012 the probability of rich rich is 35 77 which is the highest value in synchronous probability of the year the asynchronous frequencies of lg station are generally poor normal and normal rich for instance the poor normal probability is 17 61 in 2010 accounting for 53 57 of the asynchronous probability and the 2011 normal rich probability is 0 2037 accounting for 40 75 of the asynchronous probability the results are showed in fig 8 among the probabilities of ssg station the rich rich probabilities dominate for instance the probability of rich rich in 2013 is 44 78 accounting for 64 8 of the synchronous probability the rich rich probabilities in 2015 and 2014 are 36 01 and 32 01 respectively the poor normal probability dominates the asynchronous probability for instance the probability of poor normal in 2010 is 12 32 accounting for 26 41 of the asynchronous probability the synchronous probability is 40 56 and the asynchronous probability is 59 63 among them the maximum rich rich in the synchronous probability is 22 91 in the asynchronous probability poor rich probability rich poor probability and normal poor probability are 14 00 10 69 and 10 21 respectively the results are showed in 2011 the synchronous probability of runoff and sediment is lower than the asynchronous probability 4 discussions according to the statistical results based on various rsna models the impact of reservoir operation and soil and water conservation measures are discussed at the same time the uncertainties of the study are discussed 4 1 reservoir operational effects reservoir is a significant artificial structure built on the water channel reducing disaster risk and increasing local economic benefits zhang et al 2019a b c d when rivers are affected by reservoir impoundment the runoff and sediment load often changes rapidly lu et al 2019 the construction of the reservoirs not only changes the relationship between runoff and sediment he et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 kong et al 2015 but can reduce the output of sediment shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 in this research the encounter probabilities of two stations in the same year the synchronous probability in lg station is generally greater than that of ssg station then the encounter probability analysis in different years of the same station shows that the synchronous probability of runoff and sediment in lg station is greater than the asynchronous probability of that however it merely appeared that the asynchronous probability is greater than the synchronous probability of ssg station in 2011 the dq reservoir was built 40 km far away above lg station the highest flood peak of the flood season mainly occurs in july and august during the dry season the inflow of lg station is about 40 of the whole year which indicates that the dq reservoir has a significant regulating effect on the upstream the sediment discharge of lg station mainly comes from the main stream between dq reservoir and lg station the flood discharge and erosion of dq reservoir there is no reservoir above ssg station in the period the research results show that the construction of the reservoir plays an important role on the synchronous asynchronous probability of runoff and sediment erosion and changes in sediment under the dam may pose a threat to the safety of downstream of the river these issues will require more attention in the future work 4 2 effects of soil and water conservation measures soil and water conservation measures can effectively curb the output of sediments and improve the regional soil and water conservation capacity fu et al 2017 various water and soil conservation measures in the anning river have played an active role in certain aspects but sediment output in certain areas is still a problem according to the encounter probability of runoff and sediment the asynchronous probability in ssg station is relatively large ssg station locates at the outlet of sun shui river which is the largest tributary of the upper anning river the sunshui river basin has a complicated geological environment serious soil erosion and less vegetation coverage in the basin on the contrary the vegetation coverage of the upper anning river is high and the types of soils that are susceptible to erosion are relatively low according to the probability analysis we have the following conjecture in terms of soil type typical purple soil zhu et al 2012 in the sunshui river watershed has a high content which is rich mineral nutrients and benefit to the agricultural development however the texture is soft the soil is shallow and it is easy to disintegrate coupled with abundant and concentrated rainfall as well as the large population density in the study area the sunshui river watershed is more likely to cause soil erosion and in terms of land use types the area of forest in sunshui river watershed is significantly less than that in the upper anning river and the area of grassland is larger than that in the upper anning river the silt retention mechanism on grassland slopes is different which results in different water and sediment production in the two rivers and the runoff and sediment transport in the river channels are also various under the condition of consistent precipitation in the basin how soil and land use affect the runoff and sediment in the basin needs further study the synchronous asynchronous probability of runoff and sediment can be used as an index to evaluate soil and water conservation 4 3 uncertainty analysis it can be seen from table 4 that the synchronous probability is greater than the asynchronous probability which is consistent with the results of other researches compared with other studies the runoff sediment nexus model selected in our study may be more accurate the optimal copula function is selected from more kinds of copula functions i e gaussian student t clayton gumbel frank and joe copula in this study furthermore the marginal distribution is selected from more species of edge distribution functions i e normal lognormal weibull gamma exp many researches confirmed the optimal copula function from less types of copula guo et al 2016 yao et al 2019 for example researchers selected frank copula in three copula types clayton frank gumbel hougaard copula when studying the series of runoff and sediment transport in the source region of the yellow river guo et al 2016 three kinds of copula function i e clayton frank gumbel copula were used to choose to establish the joint distribution model of runoff and sediment in the jinghe river basin yao et al 2019 some researchers merely chose the edge distribution to fit the marginal distribution of runoff and sediment zhang et al 2014 although we have conducted our study by scientific analysis and rigorous calculation there is still certain room for improvement firstly typical monthly runoff and sediment transport are selected to construct a coupling model although the daily scale model is more targeted the annual scale model can better reflect the inter annual trend changes secondly there are still certain uncertainties in the choice of marginal distribution function and copula function more kinds of marginal distribution types and copula function types should be considered thirdly only two hydrological stations were used in the study the more numerous of hydrological stations will better reflect the variation of runoff and sediment law in the region therefore hydrological models will be introduced in order to obtain long series data of runoff and sediment in the future research in addition bigger amount of typical hydrological stations may be considered in the watershed for encounter probability analysis 5 conclusions in this research the joint distribution model of runoff and sediment was constructed in the flood season of the anning river basin multiple coupling measurement and comprehensive evaluation of the runoff and sediment variables were realized based on runoff and sediment data from 2010 to 2015 suitable rsna models were constructed also based on runoff sediment nexus analysis model we preformed the temporal spatial analysis for synchronous asynchronous probability the following conclusions were obtained a temporal analysis shows that at the same hydrological station the synchronous probability of runoff and sediment is greater than the asynchronous probability of runoff and sediment indicating that runoff and sediment are consistent generally b the spatial analysis shows that the synchronous probability in ssg station is generally lower than that of lg station it means that the soil and water conservation and runoff and sediment regulation in the upper anning river are better than those in sunshui river and c analyse and discuss the factors of different synchronous and asynchronous probabilities of runoff and sediment at different sites and different years such as soil and water conservation measures the reservoirs operation and the rsna models are also full of uncertainties therefore this research could improve the understanding of the interactive relationship between runoff and sediment and offer a significant reference for regional management on soil and water conservation author contributions yutong li has made substantial

sediment are of importance to many rivers across the world yan et al 2011 dong et al 2014 ewane and lee 2017 runoff and sediment are highly interdependent leading to a close relationship between the two factors within any specific river basin matthew et al 2011 wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 ngo et al 2015 ni et al 2019 at the same time they are of significance to water resources utilization water related project safety maintenance and watershed sustainable development tan et al 2013 gopal et al 2015 boluwade and madramootoo 2017 trinh et al 2017 ho et al 2019 obviously flux dynamics and the associated interactions of runoff and sediment have multiple implications and are an important basis for flood control water resource utilization and water conservancy infrastructure planning tan et al 2011 tian et al 2015 in particular investigation and analysis of the runoff and sediment nexus under changing environmental conditions can provide a theoretical basis for water and soil erosion control ecological restoration and disaster prevention tan et al 2010 nigam et al 2017 this is of increasing concern to both research and management communities however nexus processes of runoff and sediments in rivers are extremely complicated involving a number of interactive parameters and procedures the complexity of the corresponding dual processes of runoff and sediment is enormously magnified posing great challenges to decision makers and watershed managers therefore it is desired to identify and analyse relationships of runoff and sediment previously many studies were undertaken to analyse the nexus between runoff and sediment they mainly focused on external factors such as climatic conditions e g precipitation and human activities e g construction and operation of water conservancy projects on runoff and sediment yielding mechanism as well as the associated reduction and controlling measures ahmadisharaf et al 2020 for example the runoff and sediment nexus is concerned to water and soil resource management wang et al 2015 in recent years relevant research was conducted on variations in runoff and sediment depositions gao et al 2013 ye et al 2014 guo et al 2017 quantified runoff and sediment nexus under natural rainfall events with diverse land disturbances and plot lengths in order to compare soil and water losses from multiple plots meanwhile the relationship between sediment yield and rainfall intensity was described xia et al 2017 examined changing trends of runoff and sediment yields from 1981 to 2012 in the yanwachuan watershed and analysed the measures resulting in runoff variations and sediment reduction systematically at the same time the precipitation changes and soil and water conservation measures on runoff and sediment yields were evaluated wu et al 2012 investigated the impacts of surface runoff and sediment contents on the characteristics of n and p losses and explored the effects of contributing factors on runoff and sediments peña angulo et al 2019 analysed the relationships between precipitation runoff sediment yield and soil erosion with multiple weather conditions throughout the mediterranean basin hu et al 2019 explored the relationships between the sediment yield and predominated hydrologic variables under multiple flooding patterns in the loess plateau where located in the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river of northwest china however the relationship between runoff and sediment was quantified in relatively simply ways and their complex relationship were explored by limited number of researchers in the past decades copula functions were utilized in many areas e g hydrology energy and finance goodwin and hungerford 2014 liu et al 2017a 2017b grimaldi et al 2016 cubillos rocha et al 2019 because copula function can accurately deal with nonlinear asymmetric correlations and allow a variety of marginal distributions li et al 2017 nadal romero et al 2015 tan et al 2017 for instance combination of copula function and risk analysis was used to quantify the interaction of water and energy resources systems cai et al 2019 the copula functions were used to establish the joint probability distribution function of runoff and tn tp concentration to improve the accuracy of miyun reservoir water quality risk prediction wang et al 2017 previously copula functions were widely used in recent years to analyse the synchronous asynchronous joint probability of hydrological variables it was explored that synchronous asynchronous joint probability of rich low precipitation in the middle route of south to north water diversion in china yan and chen 2013 copula functions were used in constructing bivariate runoff distributions to calculate the joint probability distribution then encounter probability on runoff of the jinsha river and its tributary yalong river was explored lei et al 2018 however few researchers used copula functions to analyse the nexus of runoff and sediment guo et al 2016 and zhang et al 2014 analysed the synchronous asynchronous joint probabilities of rich poor runoff and sediment discharge in weihe basin although they introduced a flexible and appropriate copula function to develop a runoff and sediment model less attention to the occurrences of these results in this research a modelling approach for river runoff and sediment nexus analysis under multiple flows will be constructed the anning river basin a hyper sediment concentrated river of southwest china will be employed as the demonstrative river it is the economic development centre of the region including the second largest barn in sichuan province due to the concentrated and intensive rainfall and soil loose the landslide debris flow occurs frequently which makes the anning river basin hyper concentrated sediment in southwest china therefore it is important to consider the runoff and sediment nexus and deeply analyse the relationships between runoff and sediment in the watershed the following tasks will be undertaken a analysis of the historical long term surface rainfall change trend b introduce a copula function to construct the joint distribution model of runoff and sediment c analysis of encounter probabilities of multiple water flow conditions the following innovations are associated with the research including a the complex interactions between runoff and sediment will be quantified in a river of high sediment concentration and b encounter probabilities of runoff and sediment will be analysed from the view of temporal spatial aspect 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the study area the anning river with a mainstream length of 326 km is the largest tributary in the lower reach of the yalong river the largest tributary of the jinsha river the anning river fig 1 with a drainage area of 11 150 km2 locates in the transitional zone of the qinghai tibet plateau the yunnan kwei chow plateau and the sichuan basin this transitional zone is an important ecological barrier in the upper reach of the yangtze river and plays a significant role in the ecological security maintenance of sichuan province zhang et al 2019a b c d anning valley is the second largest valley plain in sichuan province shao et al 2013 the terrain has obvious differences in the study area ma et al 2018 the topography of the study area is high in the north and the west at the same time it is low in the south and the east with an elevation of 900 to 4750 m the anning river basin is characterized by concentrated rainfall with high intensity sparse soil and frequent landslide debris flow ni et al 2019 the average annual precipitation is 1133 mm it is rainy from may to october every year which accounts for over 90 of the total precipitation and the precipitation in mountainous areas is more than that in the adjacent valleys the maximum flood peaks mostly occur in july and august shao et al 2013 the annual sediment contents of wantan station which is the outlet reach 1 44 kg m3 the average annual sediment discharge is 8 98 million tons of wantan station there are two hydrological stations above the irrigation area in the middle reaches of the anning river basin namely lugu lg and sunshuiguan ssg lg station locates in the upstream of the anning river basin the daqiao dq reservoir was built approximately 40 km away at present the sediment content of the section is monitored only in flooding season the average sediment content in the flood season is 360 g m3 lan et al 2017 in detail ssg station locates in the outlet of sunshui river which is the largest tributary on the right bank of the upper reaches of the anning river the precipitation data used in this research was established from china meteorological data service center cmdc which is an authoritative sharing platform supported by china meteorological administration cma the meteorological data was derived from a daily database and the record period was from 1971 to 2017 nine meteorology stations were selected from cmdc databases for this research the daily runoff data r and daily sediment data s of the two stations i e lg ssg were collected from annual hydrological report 2 2 methodology rainfall change dominated the variation in runoff in the jinsha river basin and it also had a significant impact on the sediment conditions rainfall is the main source of runoff and the main cause of sediment production puntenney desmond et al 2020 monitoring and analysis of rainfall changes in the jinsha river basin could provide a scientific basis for the study of runoff and sediment variation trends lu et al 2019 therefore long series of precipitation data are used to confirm the mutation point in addition runoff and sediment nexus analysis rsna model is established including a correlation analysis of runoff and sediment b establishment of marginal probability distributions of runoff and sediment separately c construction of the joint probability distribution between runoff and sediment and d synchronous asynchronous probability setting of runoff and sediment details of the methodology of this research is shown in fig 2 2 2 1 determination of mutation point many researchers men et al 2020 showed that tyson polygon method is an accurate method for calculating surface rainfall it is suitable for the case of uneven distribution of precipitation or rainfall stations in the basin in this research the rainfall data of the stations was transformed into surface data from 1971 to 2017 based on tyson polygon method which was used for the long term analysis of the precipitation in the anning river basin in the current research the non parametric mann kendall statistical test was applied to detect the precipitation trends iqbal and athar 2017 it is effective to figure out the datasets with irregular and missing samples because it does not require the source data fit any statistical distribution and disturbed by a few outliers um et al 2017 the s statistic in this test can be defined by eq 1 1 s k i 1 k r i k 2 3 n where r i can be described as follows 2 r i 1 x i x j 0 x i x j 1 2 i where s k is the cumulative number that the value at the moment i is greater than the number of values at the moment j define statistics under the assumption that the time series are random and independent 3 uk 1 s k e s k var s k k 1 2 n where uk 1 0 e s k and var s k are mean and variance of s k when x 1 x 2 x n are independent of each other and has the same continuous distribution they can be calculated by the following formula 4 e s k k

uf k k n n 1 1 ub 1 0 given a significance level α such as α 0 05 critical value u 0 05 1 96 when there are multiple mutation points the mk test and sliding t test cooperate to identify mutation points the moving t test method is now widely used to detect the jump phenomena of climate in time series by analyzing the significant difference between the average values of paired samples liang et al 2013 the statistic in this test can be defined in eq 5 5 t x 1 x 2 s 1 n 1 1 n 2 where for the time series x with sample n set a certain time as the reference point artificially the sample sizes of the two subsequences x 1 and x 2 before and after the reference point are n 1 and n 2 the average of the two subsequences is x 1 and x 2 respectively and the variances are s 1 2and s 2 2 s n 1 s 1 2 n 2 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 distribution subject to degree of freedom γ n 1 n 2 2 2 2 2 development of a runoff sediment nexus analysis rsna model the first step is to characterize the correlation structure of the available samples and determine the correlation between runoff and sediment transport can help to select the optimal copula pearson γ kendall τ and spearman ρ are frequently used to determine the magnitude of the correlation the second step is to identify the marginal distributions between runoff and sediment which entails a selection of an appropriate type of edge distribution functions b estimation of the parameters of the edge distribution function and c test the goodness of fit to determine the optimal univariate edge distribution based on five common distribution forms i e normal lognormal weibull gamma and expedition the maximum likelihood method or moment matching estimation method were used to fit the edge distributions the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic statistical indicators are the smallest and the kolmogorov smirnov test ks test is used to finally select the most suitable edge distribution function the marginal distribution types of runoff and sediment are determined the aic can be expressed as 6 aic 2 k 2 ln l where k the number of model parameters l likelihood function similarly the bic can be given by 7 bic kln n 2 ln l where k the number of model parameters n the sample size l likelihood function the ks test statistic can be defined as 8 z max 1 l n f n x l f 0 x l where n the sample size f n x l the actual distribution of sample data f 0 x l the theoretical distribution of sample data the third step is to construct a coupled model between runoff and sediment discharge which entails a selection of the appropriate copula function type i e gaussian copula student t copula clayton copula gumbel copula frank copula joe copula b estimation of unknown parameters in the copula function and c fitting goodness test to determine the optimal multivariable joint distribution function the choice of the best fitting copula is selected through the aic standard and bic standard and the ks test identifies the appropriate copula based on sklar s theorem if h is a joint distribution function with marginal distributions r and s and these marginal distributions are continuous a single copula function c exists then the copula function can be defined as follows 9 h x y c r x s y x y r where h a joint distribution function with marginal cumulative distribution functions cdfs c a copula and r x and s y are distribution functions the forth step is to set the probability of rich poor encounters since the guarantee rate based on the standard of rich poor is higher than the probability it needs to be converted into a cumulative probability the probability of runoff and sediment is divided into three states rich normal and poor by the probability method with pr 37 5 and pk 62 5 as the probability of the division of runoff and sediment the combination of the rich poor encounters includes the following nine cases table 1 3 results 3 1 analysis of the mutation point this study extracts daily data of precipitation from nine meteorology stations in the anning river basin and compute inter annual precipitation data for the missing data we use interpolation to supplement the regression method is supplemented the mann kendall method was used to detect the change trend and mutation of the annual precipitation series in the anning river basin at a given significance level α 0 05 fig 3a the results show that there are three mutation points in the study time scale indicating that the precipitation in the basin has a significant increase or decrease in a certain period however because the mann kendall method cannot determine the occurrence of multiple intersection points the auxiliary sliding t test is used to determine the precipitation in the two places when the sliding t test is performed the step size n1 n2 2 15 is taken and the precipitation data are subjected to the mutation test fig 3b the results show that the precipitation slip statistics of the anning river basin pass the significance test when the step size is 8 and the other step sizes do not result in statistics that pass the significance test therefore the significant precipitation is in 2006 by calculating the average monthly precipitation from 1971 to 2017 we know that july has the highest average monthly precipitation in this research july is selected as the typical month 3 2 analysis of runoff sediment nexus patterns according to the developed rsna model the pearson γ kendall τ and spearman ρ are used to present the correlation of runoff and sediment which can illuminate the relevance between runoff and sediment the results of correlation coefficients are shown in table 2 from the table 2 it can be seen that the three correlation coefficients of lg station are all greater than 0 3 from 2010 to 2015 it indicates that runoff and sediment of lg station has medium or above correlation similarly the correlation coefficients of ssg station in 2010 2012 2013 2015 are medium or above however in 2011 τ is 0 04 and ρ is 0 01 which indicate that runoff and sediment has weak correlation γ 0 58 is greater than 0 3 which indicates runoff and sediment in 2011 has medium correlation in 2014 γ is 0 82 that means the strong correlation the τ is 0 27 that means the weak correlation and ρ is 0 38that means the medium correlation thus there exists interdependence between runoff and sediment in lg station and ssg station next it s significant to find the optimal marginal distribution function of runoff and sediment afterwards evaluate the goodness of the results the five common distribution functions and ks test method is applied for goodness of fit test the results are shown in table s1 s12 it can be concluded that the lognormal distribution has a better fitting and pass the significance test p 0 05 therefore it is appropriate to use the lognormal marginal distributions of runoff and sediment then it s indispensable to choose the appropriate copula function to establish the joint distribution of rsna and assess the goodness of fitting the best fitting copula is chosen between the archimedean copula and the oval copula using the aic standard bic standard and the ks test the ks statistic and p value indicate that the three adopted archimedean copulas in each period can pass the ks test and are available for describing the joint probability distribution of the bivariate random variables r and s from table 3 the parameters in copula functions are listed the joe copula function is suitable for the establishment of runoff and sediment nexus model in any year and also pass the significant test p 0 05 in ssg station however the daily scale rsna model of lg station in 2010 2014 and 2015 are joe copula function gumbel copula function is optimal in 2011 and 2012 in 2013 the gaussian copula is selected next it is the joint distribution probability analysis a 3d map of the runoff and sediment joint distribution shows the probability of runoff and sediment transport in different years of the flood season the probability of various encounter events is illustrated based on the contour map of the joint distribution a 3d map of the runoff and sediment joint distribution and the contour map of the joint distribution are shown in figs 4 and 5 analyse of the synchronous asynchronous probability according to the abovementioned rsna model studying the encounters of runoff and sediment in the anning river basin from both temporal spatial perspectives after calculation the results of the analysis of runoff and sediment rich poor encounters above the irrigation area of the anning river are obtained in table 4 3 3 runoff sediment encounter probability analysis for stations the synchronous probability in ssg station is generally lower than that of lg station on the contrary the asynchronous probability in the ssg station is higher than that of lg station i e 2010 2011 2012 2014 fig 6 for instance in 2012 the synchronous probability of runoff and sediment is 67 13 in lg station and is 53 54 in ssg station the probabilities of rich rich in lg station and ssg station respectively are 31 95 and 21 56 the poor normal probabilities of asynchronous probability in two stations are respectively 17 61 and 12 37 in 2012 the synchronous probability of the lg station was 66 80 while that of ssg station is 59 89 the maximum rich rich probability of the lg station is 35 45 accounting for 53 1 and in the ssg station the maximum synchronous probability is 28 91 among the asynchronous probability of runoff and sediment the maximum probability of rich normal in lg station is 1179 and the maximum probability of normal poor in ssg station is 9 84 in 2013 and 2015 the synchronous probability of the lg station was lower than that of the ssg station in 2013 ssg station s rich rich probability was highest at 44 48 but lg station s rich rich probability was 23 60 in 2015 the asynchronous probability is 43 25 as well as the asynchronous probability is 33 35 the normal rich and poor rich account for the greatest proportion of the asynchronous probability of lg station which are 11 78 and 10 41 respectively the maximum poor normal of ssg station is 9 15 in asynchronous probability the results show that the soil and water conservation and runoff and sediment regulation in the upper anning river are better than those in sunshui river 3 4 runoff sediment encounter probability analysis over the 6 year period at the same hydrological station the synchronous probability of runoff and sediment is greater than the asynchronous probability of runoff and sediment indicating that runoff and sediment are consistent in the six year flood season of lg station fig 7 the synchronous probability is greater than the asynchronous probability among the synchronous frequencies the rich rich scenario is more common especially in 2011 the probability of poor poor is36 77 accounting for 73 50 of the synchronous probability in 2012 the probability of rich rich is 35 77 which is the highest value in synchronous probability of the year the asynchronous frequencies of lg station are generally poor normal and normal rich for instance the poor normal probability is 17 61 in 2010 accounting for 53 57 of the asynchronous probability and the 2011 normal rich probability is 0 2037 accounting for 40 75 of the asynchronous probability the results are showed in fig 8 among the probabilities of ssg station the rich rich probabilities dominate for instance the probability of rich rich in 2013 is 44 78 accounting for 64 8 of the synchronous probability the rich rich probabilities in 2015 and 2014 are 36 01 and 32 01 respectively the poor normal probability dominates the asynchronous probability for instance the probability of poor normal in 2010 is 12 32 accounting for 26 41 of the asynchronous probability the synchronous probability is 40 56 and the asynchronous probability is 59 63 among them the maximum rich rich in the synchronous probability is 22 91 in the asynchronous probability poor rich probability rich poor probability and normal poor probability are 14 00 10 69 and 10 21 respectively the results are showed in 2011 the synchronous probability of runoff and sediment is lower than the asynchronous probability 4 discussions according to the statistical results based on various rsna models the impact of reservoir operation and soil and water conservation measures are discussed at the same time the uncertainties of the study are discussed 4 1 reservoir operational effects reservoir is a significant artificial structure built on the water channel reducing disaster risk and increasing local economic benefits zhang et al 2019a b c d when rivers are affected by reservoir impoundment the runoff and sediment load often changes rapidly lu et al 2019 the construction of the reservoirs not only changes the relationship between runoff and sediment he et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 kong et al 2015 but can reduce the output of sediment shi et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 in this research the encounter probabilities of two stations in the same year the synchronous probability in lg station is generally greater than that of ssg station then the encounter probability analysis in different years of the same station shows that the synchronous probability of runoff and sediment in lg station is greater than the asynchronous probability of that however it merely appeared that the asynchronous probability is greater than the synchronous probability of ssg station in 2011 the dq reservoir was built 40 km far away above lg station the highest flood peak of the flood season mainly occurs in july and august during the dry season the inflow of lg station is about 40 of the whole year which indicates that the dq reservoir has a significant regulating effect on the upstream the sediment discharge of lg station mainly comes from the main stream between dq reservoir and lg station the flood discharge and erosion of dq reservoir there is no reservoir above ssg station in the period the research results show that the construction of the reservoir plays an important role on the synchronous asynchronous probability of runoff and sediment erosion and changes in sediment under the dam may pose a threat to the safety of downstream of the river these issues will require more attention in the future work 4 2 effects of soil and water conservation measures soil and water conservation measures can effectively curb the output of sediments and improve the regional soil and water conservation capacity fu et al 2017 various water and soil conservation measures in the anning river have played an active role in certain aspects but sediment output in certain areas is still a problem according to the encounter probability of runoff and sediment the asynchronous probability in ssg station is relatively large ssg station locates at the outlet of sun shui river which is the largest tributary of the upper anning river the sunshui river basin has a complicated geological environment serious soil erosion and less vegetation coverage in the basin on the contrary the vegetation coverage of the upper anning river is high and the types of soils that are susceptible to erosion are relatively low according to the probability analysis we have the following conjecture in terms of soil type typical purple soil zhu et al 2012 in the sunshui river watershed has a high content which is rich mineral nutrients and benefit to the agricultural development however the texture is soft the soil is shallow and it is easy to disintegrate coupled with abundant and concentrated rainfall as well as the large population density in the study area the sunshui river watershed is more likely to cause soil erosion and in terms of land use types the area of forest in sunshui river watershed is significantly less than that in the upper anning river and the area of grassland is larger than that in the upper anning river the silt retention mechanism on grassland slopes is different which results in different water and sediment production in the two rivers and the runoff and sediment transport in the river channels are also various under the condition of consistent precipitation in the basin how soil and land use affect the runoff and sediment in the basin needs further study the synchronous asynchronous probability of runoff and sediment can be used as an index to evaluate soil and water conservation 4 3 uncertainty analysis it can be seen from table 4 that the synchronous probability is greater than the asynchronous probability which is consistent with the results of other researches compared with other studies the runoff sediment nexus model selected in our study may be more accurate the optimal copula function is selected from more kinds of copula functions i e gaussian student t clayton gumbel frank and joe copula in this study furthermore the marginal distribution is selected from more species of edge distribution functions i e normal lognormal weibull gamma exp many researches confirmed the optimal copula function from less types of copula guo et al 2016 yao et al 2019 for example researchers selected frank copula in three copula types clayton frank gumbel hougaard copula when studying the series of runoff and sediment transport in the source region of the yellow river guo et al 2016 three kinds of copula function i e clayton frank gumbel copula were used to choose to establish the joint distribution model of runoff and sediment in the jinghe river basin yao et al 2019 some researchers merely chose the edge distribution to fit the marginal distribution of runoff and sediment zhang et al 2014 although we have conducted our study by scientific analysis and rigorous calculation there is still certain room for improvement firstly typical monthly runoff and sediment transport are selected to construct a coupling model although the daily scale model is more targeted the annual scale model can better reflect the inter annual trend changes secondly there are still certain uncertainties in the choice of marginal distribution function and copula function more kinds of marginal distribution types and copula function types should be considered thirdly only two hydrological stations were used in the study the more numerous of hydrological stations will better reflect the variation of runoff and sediment law in the region therefore hydrological models will be introduced in order to obtain long series data of runoff and sediment in the future research in addition bigger amount of typical hydrological stations may be considered in the watershed for encounter probability analysis 5 conclusions in this research the joint distribution model of runoff and sediment was constructed in the flood season of the anning river basin multiple coupling measurement and comprehensive evaluation of the runoff and sediment variables were realized based on runoff and sediment data from 2010 to 2015 suitable rsna models were constructed also based on runoff sediment nexus analysis model we preformed the temporal spatial analysis for synchronous asynchronous probability the following conclusions were obtained a temporal analysis shows that at the same hydrological station the synchronous probability of runoff and sediment is greater than the asynchronous probability of runoff and sediment indicating that runoff and sediment are consistent generally b the spatial analysis shows that the synchronous probability in ssg station is generally lower than that of lg station it means that the soil and water conservation and runoff and sediment regulation in the upper anning river are better than those in sunshui river and c analyse and discuss the factors of different synchronous and asynchronous probabilities of runoff and sediment at different sites and different years such as soil and water conservation measures the reservoirs operation and the rsna models are also full of uncertainties therefore this research could improve the understanding of the interactive relationship between runoff and sediment and offer a significant reference for regional management on soil and water conservation author contributions yutong li has made substantial

1473,accurate prediction of the subsurface transport of iodine species is important for the assessment of long term nuclear waste repository performance as well as monitoring compliance with the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty given that radioiodine decays into radioxenon however the transport of iodine through intact geologic media is not well understood compromising our ability to assess risk associated with radioiodine migration the current study s goal is to quantify the matrix diffusion of iodine species through saturated volcanic rock with particular attention paid to the redox environment and potential speciation changes diffusion experiments were run for iodide through lithophysae rich lava lithophysae poor lava and welded tuff whereas iodate diffusion was studied through welded tuff iodine transport was compared with a conservative tracer hdo and effective diffusion coefficients were calculated likely due to a combination of size and anion exclusion effects iodine species diffused more slowly than the conservative tracer through all rock types tested furthermore oxidation of iodide to iodate was observed in the lithophysae poor lava affecting transport results provide much needed data for subsurface transport models that predict radioiodine migration from underground sources and indicate the pressing need for geochemical and redox interactions to be incorporated into these models keywords matrix diffusion iodine radioiodine radionuclide repository nonproliferation 1 introduction iodine i is an important trace nutrient known for its role in thyroid functioning the development of cognitive abilities and its potential for lowering the risk of certain types of cancer dri 2005 medrano macías et al 2016 radioactive iodine including long lived 129i is also a relatively abundant 20 byproduct of nuclear fission creating the potential for exposure from spent nuclear fuel reprocessing operations nuclear weapons testing and nuclear accidents mckay et al 1984 the subsurface transport of iodine is therefore an important process with implications for human health as well as national security applications kaplan et al 2000 hu et al 2005 kalinowski 2011 currently the transport of iodine through intact geologic media is not well understood making it difficult to predict the fate of this important nuclear signature compound after a subsurface release this uncertainty compromises our ability to accurately assess the risk associated with the long term disposition of nuclear waste in underground repositories storage of nuclear waste and fuel and nuclear accidents to determine its fate after an environmental release it is therefore important to more fully understand iodine interactions with geological materials including its transport kinetics through intact media and the potential for geochemical interactions which can alter its redox state iodine 131 131i and iodine 129 129i are of particular environmental concern because of their radioactivity and associated health physics body burden these isotopes can be taken up by thyroid tissue and emit low energy beta and gamma radiation as they decay potentially causing radiation induced cancer non cancerous growths and thyroiditis due to its short half life of 8 02 days 131i has a high specific activity and was monitored extensively by the epa at the nevada test site during weapons testing however its short half life also means it will not contribute in the long term to risks associated with the geological deposition of nuclear waste 129i on the other hand has a half life of 15 7 million years and is thus a more pervasive environmental contaminant robens and aumann 1988 studies have been conducted at the hanford site zhang et al 2013 and offshore of fukushima hou et al 2013 tracking 129i plumes more than 2300 kg of 129i was also discharged from nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities in europe between 1966 and 1999 and tracked for its transport in marine environments fréchou and calmet 2003 however these studies focused on iodine transport in ground and surface water rather than through rock which is likely to be the dominant iodine migration pathway from underground repositories or underground nuclear testing sites risk calculations of human exposure from nuclear waste repositories often focus on 129i due to its relative abundance in waste long half life and mobility in the subsurface garrick 2002 hou et al 2009 recent studies have focused in particular on iodine interactions with cement guo et al 2019 kaplan et al 2019 and bentonite zhao et al 2016 which are utilized as barriers immediately adjacent to or encapsulating radioactive waste however once in the subsurface iodine can diffuse through and interact with various strata in the vicinity of a repository site predicting the subsurface transport of iodine will also help in deciphering important signals derived from underground nuclear explosions unes radioiodine s daughter product radioxenon is widely considered an ideal monitoring candidate for direct detection of unes sun and carrigan 2014 the international monitoring system ims can measure 133xe at a minimum detectable concentration mdc of 0 15 0 2 mbq m 3 to track compliance with the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty ctbt ringbom et al 2015 radioxenon can also be produced through civil events such as medical isotope production and by commercial nuclear reactors necessitating improved models of iodine transport in the subsurface to prevent misinterpretation of radioxenon isotopic signatures for example lowrey et al 2013 found that after incorporating underground transport into une models predicted xenon ratios fell outside of the range typically considered indicative of nuclear events 20 of the time however this study only accounted for the diffusive transport of xenon with iodine treated as a stationary source term this is not the case in true unes where iodine has been detected at the surface hours to days following detonation kalinowski 2011 these findings draw immediate attention to the need for better models of subsurface iodine transport through intact rock iodine is redox active and will be present predominantly as iodide i iodine i2 or iodate io3 within the redox conditions that prevail in natural aqueous environments fuge and johnson 2015 the transport of iodine in bedrock is dictated by both redox conditions and specific interactions between iodine species and subsurface minerals previously iodide i was thought to act as a conservative tracer with very limited sorption boving and grathwohl 2001 neretnieks 1980 turin et al 2002 nevertheless an increasing body of literature has shown evidence for appreciable sorption of iodide i as well as iodate io3 and that this sorption extent will vary significantly depending on the geologic media couture and seitz 1983 hu et al 2005 kaplan 2003 sheppard et al 1996 yoshida et al 1998 despite these anions being redox sensitive a careful examination of the literature shows that most studies examining i and io3 interactions with various minerals did not account for potential changes in the iodine speciation it is therefore important to quantify the relative transport of iodine species through different rock types while considering the complex geochemical behavior and the potential interconversion between different iodine species one key parameter in quantifying this transport is the effective diffusion coefficient boving and grathwohl 2001 when aqueous solutes are transported through saturated rock although they may be transported primarily through fractures where present quantities will diffuse into pores of the surrounding rock matrix constituting a dual porosity system this effect significantly slows down the transport time of diffusing species relative to the overall transport of water through fractures and this effect can be further compounded by solute sorption or chemical reaction with mineral surfaces the goal of the current study is to quantify the effective diffusion coefficients of iodate and iodide and investigate the potential for interconversion between the two species during transport through saturated volcanic rock cores these lithologies are present at sites where historical une tests have occurred and at proposed nuclear waste repository sites johnstone and wolfsberg 1980 prothro and drellack jr 1997 iodine diffusion was run concurrently with a deuterated water tracer accurate determination of the diffusion parameters for iodine species is critical to the performance assessment of nuclear waste repositories and for the assessment of iodine transport from nuclear test sites findings will be incorporated into subsurface transport models to better predict the risk associated with an accidental release of radioiodine and to aid in the detection of unes 2 methods 2 1 rock core samples rock cores were taken from the ue 20c borehole on pahute mesa at the nevada national security site nnss fig 1 these samples were previously characterized for the matrix diffusion of tritiated water 3hho by telfeyan et al 2018 the length of the core is made up of several different hydrostratigraphic units consisting of rock types with variable mineralogies and transport characteristics we focused on samples taken from depths of 1353 1353 28 ft 412 39 412 48 m

flow and tiva canyon moderate to densely welded tuff respectively the porosity permeability and hydraulic conductivity values were measured previously by telfeyan et al 2018 table 1 samples were further characterized using thin section analysis to identify dominant mineral phases x ray fluorescence xrf was conducted using a rigaku zsx primus ii xrf sequential wavelength dispersive spectrometer rigaku corporation japan to quantify the relative abundance of major and minor elements and zeta potential analysis was implemented using a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd worcestershire uk to measure the surface charge of the rocks under experimental conditions although core thickness will impact diffusion as it can change the pore matrix connectivity and rock capacity in terms of sorption and dead end pore volume the thinnest core width of 2 cm is adequate to accurately determine the diffusion coefficient valkiainen et al 1996 2 2 iodide and iodate sorption experiments iodide and iodate sorption onto the rock cores was investigated using a series of batch sorption experiments which were all run in triplicate core samples were ground up and sieved to obtain a size range between 150 and 500 μm then washed in tap water to remove fines sorption experiments were performed at a constant liquid to solid ratio by using 0 3 g of each rock core and 4 ml tap water electrolyte solutions the concentration of the background electrolyte and nature of the salt were varied to probe the effect of cations and anions on the resulting kd batch experiments were performed with 0 1 m nacl nabr or kcl to investigate the effects of cation or anion identity additional experiments were run with 0 01 m nacl and 1 m nacl to investigate the effects of ionic strength on iodine sorption sorption experiments were setup in 10 ml glass vials sealed using caps the rock samples were weighed individually in the glass vials and aliquots of the electrolyte solution were added to the samples and left to equilibrate for 2 days after equilibrating the solution and rock samples were amended with iodide or iodate solutions which were spiked with a radioiodine 129i tracer and equilibrated for 2 weeks on a shaker table at 50 rpm 129i decays through beta emission with a maximum energy of 154 4 kev fan et al 2013 a constant iodide or iodate concentration of 10 ppm was used for all experiments core a c samples were spiked with radioiodide and core d samples was spiked with radioiodate radioiodate 129io3 was prepared by bubbling chlorine gas generated in situ through a radioiodide 129i solution the solution turns brown after the initiation of chlorine gas bubbling then becomes clear after the transformation of i2 to io3 uv visible spectroscopy was used to make sure all iodide was transformed to iodate controls without rock materials were used to account for any iodine sorption to glass vials an identical set of sorption batch experiments was conducted outside of the radiological laboratory setting i e no radioiodine to monitor iodine speciation changes using uv vis at the completion of the equilibration time 1 ml of solution from each vial was sampled added to a liquid scintillation counting lsc vial and weighed to determine the exact amount of sample an aliquot of 16 ml of ultima gold scintillation cocktail perkinelmer inc waltham ma and 3 ml of di water were added to each vial liquid scintillation counting was then carried out using a quantulus 1220 ultra low level liquid scintillation counter perkinelmer inc waltham ma each sample was measured in triplicate for 15 min counts kd was calculated according to the following equation 1 k d c i v i c f v f c f m s where kd ml g is the adsorption distribution coefficient ci is the initial concentration of iodine in cpm ml counts per minute per ml cf is the final concentration of iodine cpm ml after equilibration with the rock core sediment vi and vf are the initial and final solution volumes and ms is the mass of sediment 2 3 diffusion cell set up prior to being placed in the diffusion cell the sides of the rock core were sealed to ensure that diffusion occurred in the axial direction rather than radially first the flat faces of the core were covered to prevent being contacted with silicone and the edges were coated in a silicone primer the core was then placed in a square mold which was filled with room temperature vulcanization rtv silicone silpak inc pomona ca usa and set overnight the set silicone provided a seal between the two water reservoirs that make up the diffusion cell once the rock cores were prepared they were submerged in los alamos municipal tap water see table s1 in the supporting information si for water composition and placed under vacuum to saturate these cores had been previously equilibrated with degassed tap water for diffusion studies and this water composition did not trigger mineral dissolution telfeyan et al 2018 cores were weighed daily and assumed to be saturated once they stopped gaining weight approximately two weeks cores were then transferred to the diffusion cell a schematic of which can be found in fig s2 in the si this cell consisted of two cylindrical reservoirs machined out of plexiglass the larger reservoir had a volume of approximately 900 or 1600 ml depending on the cell size and the smaller reservoir had a volume of approximately 120 or 200 ml this difference in volume minimizes concentration changes in the larger reservoir after being spiked with the tracer and anion of interest exact volumes for each cell were determined gravimetrically by weighing the empty cells and the cells filled with deionized di water table s2 in the si these precise volumes were used to calculate dilution factors the two reservoirs were placed on either side of the rock core and secured tightly against the silicone with screws reservoirs were filled with degassed los alamos municipal tap water ph 8 25 the cells that contained iodide were oriented on a stir plate with the larger reservoir on top and the smaller one on the bottom at these length scales the effect of gravity on diffusion is assumed to be negligible jackson 1964 a magnetic stir bar was placed in the smaller cell and it was stirred continuously during the diffusion period to prevent the formation of a concentration gradient at the mineral surface care was also taken to remove and prevent bubble formation in the smaller reservoir as that could impact the surface area for diffusion the diffusion cell that contained iodate was oriented on its side because of bubble formation due to the addition of a small amount of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 fisher scientific pittsburgh pa usa which was used to maintain oxidizing conditions needed to minimize the transformation of iodate to iodide 2 4 spiking and sampling procedure after preparing the diffusion cells the large reservoirs were spiked with d2o and potassium iodide ki 99 0 acs alfa aesar haverhill ma usa or potassium iodate kio3 99 4 acs acros organics fisher scientific waltham ma usa to obtain target concentrations of approximately 300 ppm d2o and 10 ppm iodide iodate after d2o addition it will quickly equilibrate with water to form deuterated water hdo allen and bayly 1976 thus measured diffusion values are for the hdo species for the two benham aquifer cores core a b in table 1 potassium iodide was used as the iodine species for the tiva canyon tuff two core samples cores c d in table 1 were utilized iodide diffusion was measured in core c and iodate diffusion was measured in core d these two cores provide a good basis of comparison for iodide versus iodate diffusion because they were taken from the same depth and have similar hydrogeological characteristics iodide i is the stable iodine species in our water chemistry as confirmed both experimentally section s4 in the si and using geochemist s workbench software v 12 rockware inc golden co to model the eh ph stability field fig s1 in the si additional testing was done to stabilize iodate through the addition of an oxidizing agent and a 0 015 v v h2o2 solution in tap water was found to be sufficient to stabilize iodate therefore both reservoirs of the iodate diffusion systems were spiked with h2o2 to 0 015 v v prior to addition of iodate after spiking the large reservoirs with d2o aldrich chemical company milwaukee wi and iodine the entire cell was inverted several times to ensure mixing and a sample was taken from the large reservoir to provide an initial concentration c0 approximately 0 5 ml samples were taken daily from the smaller reservoir and weighed to record their exact mass the removed volume was replaced by the same volume of degassed tap water or degassed tap water with 0 015 v v h2o2 this dilution was accounted for when calculating c c0 values samples were diluted with deionized di nanopure water on a mass basis for hdo measurement using a micromass isoprime continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms micromass manchester uk and a picarro l1115 i water isotope analyzer picarro inc santa clara ca usa after measurement they were diluted further for iodine measurement using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 2 5 effective diffusion coefficient calculation diffusion in these systems is characterized by the 1 d

using the diffcell computer code which employs an implicit finite difference method to solve eqn 2 3 and 4 numerically reimus et al 2002 the effective diffusion coefficient de was obtained in diffcell by manually varying the input de until the sum of squares for the experimental and modeled co t ci 0 difference was minimized 2 6 iodine speciation determination with uv visible spectroscopy to check for iodine speciation changes aqueous samples were analyzed using a cary 8454 uv visible diode array spectrophotometer agilent technologies santa clara ca due to the high background absorption of tap water below 210 nm analysis was limited to a wavelength range greater than 210 nm this range still allowed characterization of the relative contributions of iodide i iodate io3 and iodine i2 which have absorbance peaks at 226 nm 191 nm and 203 nm respectively uv vis absorption spectra were deconvoluted using gaussians for each peak of the form 5 a ν a max exp ν ν 0 2 2 σ 2 where amax is the maximum absorption of the peak ν0 is the wavenumber value where the peak occurs and σ is the full width at half maximum brown 2006 the gaussian curves for the three components were summed and differences between the combined calculated spectrum and measured spectrum were minimized using least squares analysis by adjusting amax and σ areas under the individual component curves were then summed to get estimates of their relative abundances 3 results 3 1 rock core mineralogy petrologic characterization of the four ue 20c rock cores used in this study was conducted on thin sections

associated with biotite and ilmenite a feti oxide with the chemical composition fetio3 3 2 iodine sorption results table 3 summarizes the kd values for iodide and iodate sorption measured under different electrolyte conditions the uncertainty on the values for many of the measured conditions are within the magnitude of kd and very small or negative values of kd indicate that these interactions are weak multiple studies have measured negative kd values for iodine onto other geologic material due to these weak interactions hu et al 2012 miller et al 2015 before considering whether there were any trends in the observed values we first conducted hypothesis testing to ensure that the calculated kd values were significantly different from zero excel was used to run t tests checking two hypotheses about the measured sorption data for this test the t statistic was calculated according to the following equation 6 t x 1 x 2 s p 2 n where x 1 and x 2 are the population means sp is the pooled standard deviation and n is the sample size the first hypothesis h1 was that the cpm ml values in the blanks and sample vials were different from one another the second h2 was that the change in cpm ml values in the blanks and sample vials was different from the standard deviation of the measurements for these analyses two tailed tests assuming equal variances of the populations were applied resulting p values can be found in table 3 the p value or probability value is an estimate of the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if the p value is 0 05 or lower the null hypothesis is rejected meaning results are significant these values indicate that there is not an experimental system where the null could be rejected for both hypotheses thus there was no statistically significant observed or measurable sorption and we can assume that sorption is not a significant mechanism of iodine retardation in our matrices this observation is consistent with previous studies for example strickert et al 1980 reported kd values of 1 ml g for both iodide and iodate sorption onto tuff granite and dolomite while hu et al 2012 reported low kd values for sorption onto tuff of 0 068 and 0 209 ml g for iodide and iodate respectively in general anions such as iodide and iodate tend not to sorb strongly in the subsurface where neutral to alkaline ph values typically ranging between 6 and 8 lead to many minerals having a negative surface charge chowdhury et al 2011 we further measured the surface charge of the rock cores used in the diffusion experiments in tap water at the system ph of 8 3 0 1 the zeta potentials of the rock cores were 28 8 1 6 30 0 1 1 28 8 0 6 and 36 6 0 2 mv for cores a d respectively 3 3 effective diffusion coefficients breakthrough curves representing the normalized concentration c c0 of hdo i and io3 for the four diffusion experiments are shown in fig 3 dotted lines correspond with de values which are equal to 10 of the best fit de very few of the measured concentrations fall outside of this range indicating that this is a good fit for experimental data visual inspection reveals that iodide and iodate diffusion was significantly lower than that of the conservative tracer hdo for all rock cores studied best fit lines show the diffusion curves calculated using fitted de values and measured core characteristics including porosity and core geometry the effective diffusion coefficient is defined as van loon et al 2004 7 d e εδ τ d w where τ is the tortuosity factor δ is a constrictivity factor ε is the diffusion accessible porosity and dw is the molecular diffusion coefficient in water the shapes of these curves match the experimental data indicating that the model accurately reflects transport over the timeframe of the experimental study effective diffusion coefficients de calculated using the diffcell computer code for hdo and the iodine species are presented in table 4 values previously reported for 3hho diffusion through the same cores are also included in this table although telfeyan et al 2018 measured deuterated water diffusion as well they used a different method which had 15 30 variance from the diffusion cell method some of this error may be due to the difference in solute identity however it is not possible to distinguish this from method effects therefore comparisons were drawn only between our hdo measurements and 3hho measurements conducted using the same experimental set up de values for 3hho and hdo are in close agreement for lithophysae rich lava and welded tuff run with iodide as expected since 3hho and hdo should both transport conservatively however the de values for hdo in lithophysae poor lava and in the welded tuff core run with iodate were both slightly lower than that of 3hho previously determined for the same cores reasons for this are explored in section 4 4 there is currently limited data on iodide and iodate diffusion coefficients through the studied rock types however one study which included iodide diffusion through tuff measured a de of 7 10 11 m2 s close to our measured value of 9 76 10 11 m2 s kita et al 1989 4 discussion 4 1 minimal iodine sorption to volcanic rocks diffusion results revealed a number of interesting trends in iodine transport the first was that iodine matrix diffusion is significantly slower than that of hdo in all four systems studied the data also showed that the diffusion of io3 is slower than that of i we first considered whether this difference could be related to the sorption capacity of our rock cores for different iodine species as iodate tends to adsorb more strongly to geological materials than i kaplan et al 2014 neeway et al 2019 sorption experiments for iodide and iodate were carried out in the presence of various salt solutions to give insight into the sorption mechanism fig 4 iodine sorption in 0 1 m concentrations of nacl and kcl were compared to determine whether anion exchange is the dominant mechanism if iodine behavior were similar in the two systems with equal cl concentrations it would indicate such if interactions were instead controlled by the mineral surface charge equimolar concentrations of nacl and nabr should have the same sorption magnitude as they have equal na concentrations on the other hand if br competes with i or io3 for sorption sites this will be reflected by differences between nacl and nabr results finally varying the concentration of nacl can address whether formation of neutral nai aq species is facilitating sorption as has been proposed in the literature for iodide interactions with clay minerals miller et al 2015 as discussed in section 3 2 observation of sorption trends was made difficult by the low sorption quantities and measurement error statistical analysis indicated that sorption quantities are essentially equal to zero after considering measurement and replicate variation despite this we conducted theoretical fitting of the diffusion data for core a to observe how larger kd values may impact transport if they were true values what we found was that once the retardation factor rm exceeded 2 6 the fitted effective diffusion coefficient for iodide exceeded that of hdo this rm corresponds with a kd value of approximately 0 12 ml g within the measured error range for several of the experimental conditions this should not be physically possible considering the free water diffusion coefficient of hdo is higher than that of iodide this further confirms our conclusion that iodide and iodate are not sorbing significantly meaning that a separate mechanism is responsible for the observed retardation relative to the conservative tracer 4 2 iodine diffusion dependent on size and anion exclusion as sorption does not appear to play a role in the interaction of iodine species with the rock materials we considered whether size and or anion exclusion effects contributed to the observed retardation of iodide and iodate relative to hdo interactions between negatively charged solutes and surfaces will lead to anion exclusion a phenomenon well documented for anion transport through clays dagnelie et al 2018 the fact that all four volcanic rocks had a negative surface charge therefore further supports the predominance of the anion exclusion mechanism for iodine species diffusion in accordance with this mechanism the anion accessible porosity of a rock is smaller than its total porosity because negatively charged mineral surfaces will repel anions in solution wigger and van loon 2017 anion accessible porosity has been measured to be as low as 50 10 of the total porosity of claystones mazurek et al 2011 for both rhyolitic lava and welded tuff the mineralogy primarily consists of quartz and alkali feldspar plagioclase plus 1 2 iron containing minerals these were identified as primarily ilmenite an iron titanium oxide and biotite the phpzc of quartz feldspars ilmenite and biotite are 2 8 2 0 2 4 4 5 and 3 02 respectively meaning that these mineral surfaces will be negatively charged at the system ph of 8 25 another possible retention mechanism is diffusion into dead end pores however if this were the dominant mechanism we would expect diffusion to be even slower forhdo because smaller uncharged solutes tend to become trapped in dead end pores more readily than larger charged solutes shackelford and moore 2013 the magnitude of anion exclusion effects can be quantified by comparing calculated effective diffusion coefficients with free water diffusion coefficients rearranging eq 7 gives the following relationship 8 d w d e τ εδ the factor which includes τ δ and ε is often referred to in literature as the formation factor as it is describing the properties of the rock formation if molecules diffusing through the same rock experience the same effective tortuosity constrictivity and porosity the dw de ratio should be equivalent this ratio has been used previously to determine whether the charge or size of a diffusing molecule is impacting transport kozaki et al 1999 ohlsson and neretnieks 1997 the free water diffusion coefficient dw for hdo is 2 3 10 9 m2 s compared with 2 04 10 9 m2 s for iodide and 1 42 10 9 m2 s for iodate baur et al 1959 hanna et al 1982 experimentally derived hdo effective diffusion coefficients were thus 10 0 11 1 9 5 and 11 3 times smaller than free water diffusion coefficients for lithophysae rich lava lithophysae poor lava and welded tuffs with iodide and iodate respectively for iodine species measured values were 17 7 22 7 20 9 and 28 9 times smaller than the free water iodine diffusion coefficients for lithophysae rich lava core a lithophysae poor lava core b iodide in welded tuff core c and iodate in welded tuff core d respectively the larger relative decrease for iodine species is evidence to the effects of anion exclusion in the geologic matrix however this effect appeared to be strongest in the iodate system despite iodide and iodate having the same charge this observation indicates that size exclusion also takes place a large solute size hinders transport in porous media due to steric effects which decrease accessible porosity and increase friction with pore walls wernert et al 2010 li et al 2020 iodate has a larger hydrated anion size relative to iodide and it has the ability to influence the structure of water in its hydration shell through stronger hydrogen bonding chakrabarty and williams 2016 the larger iodate clusters will therefore experience lower diffusion accessible porosity and higher tortuosity constrictivity than iodide multiple studies have reported slower matrix diffusion for larger molecules due to decreases in accessible effective porosity and steric hindrance of transport into small pores or narrow pore throats anderson and quinn 1974 hu et al 2002 shackelford and moore 2013 wernert et al 2010 li et al 2020 while these findings indicate that anion exchange is a dominant retention mechanism additional experiments can be run to conclusively prove this case for example by increasing the ionic strength of the solution ionic interactions between the rock and diffusing species can be minimized van loon et al 2007 however this is outside the scope of the current study 4 3 iodide oxidation in lithophysae poor lava system among the three iodide diffusion systems the effective diffusion coefficient of hdo was 21 3 lower in the lithophysae poor lava core b compared to the previously measured tritiated water tracer value in lithophysae rich lava core a and welded tuff core c the hdo tracer de was nearly identical to the previous value table 4 in welded tuff core d which was run with iodate the hdo tracer de decreased by 18 8 as decreases of a similar magnitude were observed in cores b and d we became curious about the final oxidation state of iodine in core b and whether formation of iodate in this system could explain the observation for this facet of the study we focused on differences between the lithophysae rich core a and lithophysae poor core b systems as they were expected to be the most geochemically similar samples from late diffusion time points 1500 h for lithophysae rich lava and lithophysae poor lava were analyzed for their iodine speciation using uv vis fig 5 visual comparison shows obvious changes to the speciation between the two systems indicating that oxidation of iodide did occur in lithophysae poor lava deconvoluting the three peaks allows for rough estimation of the contribution of the three iodine species although this method does not precisely quantify the amount of oxidized iodide it captures the clearly visible spectra changes characteristic of the formation of oxidized iodine species for the lithophysae rich lava approximately 9 was oxidized to iodate or iodine whereas for the lithophysae poor lava approximately 29 was oxidized increased proportions of both i2 and io3 were observed using uv vis spectroscopy suggesting a mechanism whereby i is oxidized to io3 via an i2 precursor as is the case for oxidation by birnessite mno2 fox et al 2009 these findings were especially surprising given the thermodynamic stability of iodide under ambient conditions the lithophysae rich lava and lithophysae poor lava also have a similar bulk mineralogy as observed with xrf and thin section analysis additional geochemical characterization is needed to determine precisely why lithophysae poor lava presented a more oxidizing environment for diffusing iodide however previous studies indicate the potential for iodide oxidation to occur during diffusive transport as a result of geochemical interaction with the rock matrix multiple studies have attributed iodide oxidation to manganese oxides mno2 and species of nitrogen such as nitrate anschutz et al 2000 fox et al 2009 fox et al 2010 in another previous study fuhrmann et al 1998 found that their 125i tracer which was added as an i species oxidized to io3 within 15 days in the presence of biotite they assumed that this was due to oxygen in the air however i was stable in our system under ambient conditions we therefore hypothesize that geochemical interactions between iodide and minerals in the lithophysae poor lava system could contribute to the observed change in iodine speciation octahedral ferrous iron in biotite is susceptible to oxidation and previous analysis of fe2 fe3 ratios of biotite in lava found that the oxidized fraction ranged from 0 250 to 0 560 feldstein et al 1996 this ferric iron may oxidize iodide during diffusion through the matrix however more detailed analysis outside of the scope of the current study such as x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps or x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy xanes to examine the fe oxidation state is recommended as a future direction to explore differences in oxidizing mineral content within lithophysae rich and lithophysae poor lavas 4 4 iodate containing systems presented slower hdo diffusion the drop in hdo tracer de for cores b and d indicates that iodate presence may affect diffusion pathways for hdo in the rock matrix the effective diffusion coefficient is a product of the free water diffusion coefficient matrix tortuosity effective porosity and constrictivity as shown in eq 7 telfeyan et al 2018 one indicator of matrix tortuosity and constrictivity is the hydraulic conductivity lower conductivity for approximately the same porosity can be caused by both tighter constrictions in pore spaces i e more constrictivity and by a less straight forward flow path i e more tortuosity and will impact both iodine and hdo diffusion we therefore examined whether the presence of iodate coincides with altered hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic conductivities of the two welded tuff cores were re measured after diffusion experiments using the falling head method for welded tuff core c which was run with iodide the hydraulic conductivity was 1 41 0 19 10 8 cm s compared with 1 47 10 8 cm s measured by telfeyan et al 2018 before the diffusion study these differences are well within the error of the measurements for welded tuff core d which was run with iodate the hydraulic conductivity was 1 16 0 09 10 8 cm s after the diffusion study compared with 2 45 10 8 cm s before the study with this difference in mind we measured the hydraulic conductivity in the lithophysae poor lava system after the diffusion study and fount that it decreased from 5 00 10 7 cm s to 2 10 0 13 10 7 cm s thus the presence of iodate does appear to correspond with a changing matrix pore structure as reflected in decreasing hydraulic conductivity values while this finding is secondary to the goal of this study which was measuring the diffusion coefficients for iodine species we feel that it is important to note the exact mechanism of this observation however is not currently known and requires further targeted experimentation the fact that iodate was formed and stable in cores b and d despite iodide being the stable species in the degassed tap water solution indicates the presence of locally oxidizing microenvironments within pore matrices thus even in anoxic subsurface environments similar geochemical interactions may occur this oxidizing environment may have triggered dissolution and secondary mineral precipitation reactions which altered the matrix structure affecting diffusive transport precipitation impacting diffusive transport has been reported on a similar time scale to our diffusion experiments chagneau et al 2015 luquot et al 2014 pfingsten et al 2006 however more investigations are needed to determine whether our experimental conditions are sufficient to trigger precipitation extensive enough to impact the pore network regardless of the exact mechanism results presented here clearly indicate the importance of considering iodine speciation changes and potential geochemical reactions during subsurface transport 5 conclusions new insights into iodine matrix diffusion achieved in this study are key to predict the risk associated with a subsurface radioiodine release and more accurately monitor for clandestine nuclear activity for instance while the observed lower effective diffusion coefficients for iodide limit transport through intact rock a lower effective diffusion coefficient means iodide transport can be more efficient through fractures in the normal case for iodine release into crystalline bedrock fractures and fracture zones are always present furthermore when considering iodine as a une signature without significant diffusion into the adjacent matrix iodine species may transport more quickly relative to other fission products contributing to fractionation and changing its isotopic ratio relative to other nuclear isotopic signatures understanding and removing these fractionation effects from isotopic ratios are important tools used to distinguish une signatures from other background radionuclide sources e g medical isotope production facilities and commercial nuclear power plants variations in diffusion between the rock types and iodine species highlight the importance of considering both geochemistry and water composition when characterizing subsurface transport reactive transport calculations used for risk assessments must fully incorporate these factors additional studies of iodide and iodate diffusion through lava flow and tuff samples from other sites are also recommended

1473,accurate prediction of the subsurface transport of iodine species is important for the assessment of long term nuclear waste repository performance as well as monitoring compliance with the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty given that radioiodine decays into radioxenon however the transport of iodine through intact geologic media is not well understood compromising our ability to assess risk associated with radioiodine migration the current study s goal is to quantify the matrix diffusion of iodine species through saturated volcanic rock with particular attention paid to the redox environment and potential speciation changes diffusion experiments were run for iodide through lithophysae rich lava lithophysae poor lava and welded tuff whereas iodate diffusion was studied through welded tuff iodine transport was compared with a conservative tracer hdo and effective diffusion coefficients were calculated likely due to a combination of size and anion exclusion effects iodine species diffused more slowly than the conservative tracer through all rock types tested furthermore oxidation of iodide to iodate was observed in the lithophysae poor lava affecting transport results provide much needed data for subsurface transport models that predict radioiodine migration from underground sources and indicate the pressing need for geochemical and redox interactions to be incorporated into these models keywords matrix diffusion iodine radioiodine radionuclide repository nonproliferation 1 introduction iodine i is an important trace nutrient known for its role in thyroid functioning the development of cognitive abilities and its potential for lowering the risk of certain types of cancer dri 2005 medrano macías et al 2016 radioactive iodine including long lived 129i is also a relatively abundant 20 byproduct of nuclear fission creating the potential for exposure from spent nuclear fuel reprocessing operations nuclear weapons testing and nuclear accidents mckay et al 1984 the subsurface transport of iodine is therefore an important process with implications for human health as well as national security applications kaplan et al 2000 hu et al 2005 kalinowski 2011 currently the transport of iodine through intact geologic media is not well understood making it difficult to predict the fate of this important nuclear signature compound after a subsurface release this uncertainty compromises our ability to accurately assess the risk associated with the long term disposition of nuclear waste in underground repositories storage of nuclear waste and fuel and nuclear accidents to determine its fate after an environmental release it is therefore important to more fully understand iodine interactions with geological materials including its transport kinetics through intact media and the potential for geochemical interactions which can alter its redox state iodine 131 131i and iodine 129 129i are of particular environmental concern because of their radioactivity and associated health physics body burden these isotopes can be taken up by thyroid tissue and emit low energy beta and gamma radiation as they decay potentially causing radiation induced cancer non cancerous growths and thyroiditis due to its short half life of 8 02 days 131i has a high specific activity and was monitored extensively by the epa at the nevada test site during weapons testing however its short half life also means it will not contribute in the long term to risks associated with the geological deposition of nuclear waste 129i on the other hand has a half life of 15 7 million years and is thus a more pervasive environmental contaminant robens and aumann 1988 studies have been conducted at the hanford site zhang et al 2013 and offshore of fukushima hou et al 2013 tracking 129i plumes more than 2300 kg of 129i was also discharged from nuclear fuel reprocessing facilities in europe between 1966 and 1999 and tracked for its transport in marine environments fréchou and calmet 2003 however these studies focused on iodine transport in ground and surface water rather than through rock which is likely to be the dominant iodine migration pathway from underground repositories or underground nuclear testing sites risk calculations of human exposure from nuclear waste repositories often focus on 129i due to its relative abundance in waste long half life and mobility in the subsurface garrick 2002 hou et al 2009 recent studies have focused in particular on iodine interactions with cement guo et al 2019 kaplan et al 2019 and bentonite zhao et al 2016 which are utilized as barriers immediately adjacent to or encapsulating radioactive waste however once in the subsurface iodine can diffuse through and interact with various strata in the vicinity of a repository site predicting the subsurface transport of iodine will also help in deciphering important signals derived from underground nuclear explosions unes radioiodine s daughter product radioxenon is widely considered an ideal monitoring candidate for direct detection of unes sun and carrigan 2014 the international monitoring system ims can measure 133xe at a minimum detectable concentration mdc of 0 15 0 2 mbq m 3 to track compliance with the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty ctbt ringbom et al 2015 radioxenon can also be produced through civil events such as medical isotope production and by commercial nuclear reactors necessitating improved models of iodine transport in the subsurface to prevent misinterpretation of radioxenon isotopic signatures for example lowrey et al 2013 found that after incorporating underground transport into une models predicted xenon ratios fell outside of the range typically considered indicative of nuclear events 20 of the time however this study only accounted for the diffusive transport of xenon with iodine treated as a stationary source term this is not the case in true unes where iodine has been detected at the surface hours to days following detonation kalinowski 2011 these findings draw immediate attention to the need for better models of subsurface iodine transport through intact rock iodine is redox active and will be present predominantly as iodide i iodine i2 or iodate io3 within the redox conditions that prevail in natural aqueous environments fuge and johnson 2015 the transport of iodine in bedrock is dictated by both redox conditions and specific interactions between iodine species and subsurface minerals previously iodide i was thought to act as a conservative tracer with very limited sorption boving and grathwohl 2001 neretnieks 1980 turin et al 2002 nevertheless an increasing body of literature has shown evidence for appreciable sorption of iodide i as well as iodate io3 and that this sorption extent will vary significantly depending on the geologic media couture and seitz 1983 hu et al 2005 kaplan 2003 sheppard et al 1996 yoshida et al 1998 despite these anions being redox sensitive a careful examination of the literature shows that most studies examining i and io3 interactions with various minerals did not account for potential changes in the iodine speciation it is therefore important to quantify the relative transport of iodine species through different rock types while considering the complex geochemical behavior and the potential interconversion between different iodine species one key parameter in quantifying this transport is the effective diffusion coefficient boving and grathwohl 2001 when aqueous solutes are transported through saturated rock although they may be transported primarily through fractures where present quantities will diffuse into pores of the surrounding rock matrix constituting a dual porosity system this effect significantly slows down the transport time of diffusing species relative to the overall transport of water through fractures and this effect can be further compounded by solute sorption or chemical reaction with mineral surfaces the goal of the current study is to quantify the effective diffusion coefficients of iodate and iodide and investigate the potential for interconversion between the two species during transport through saturated volcanic rock cores these lithologies are present at sites where historical une tests have occurred and at proposed nuclear waste repository sites johnstone and wolfsberg 1980 prothro and drellack jr 1997 iodine diffusion was run concurrently with a deuterated water tracer accurate determination of the diffusion parameters for iodine species is critical to the performance assessment of nuclear waste repositories and for the assessment of iodine transport from nuclear test sites findings will be incorporated into subsurface transport models to better predict the risk associated with an accidental release of radioiodine and to aid in the detection of unes 2 methods 2 1 rock core samples rock cores were taken from the ue 20c borehole on pahute mesa at the nevada national security site nnss fig 1 these samples were previously characterized for the matrix diffusion of tritiated water 3hho by telfeyan et al 2018 the length of the core is made up of several different hydrostratigraphic units consisting of rock types with variable mineralogies and transport characteristics we focused on samples taken from depths of 1353 1353 28 ft 412 39 412 48 m

flow and tiva canyon moderate to densely welded tuff respectively the porosity permeability and hydraulic conductivity values were measured previously by telfeyan et al 2018 table 1 samples were further characterized using thin section analysis to identify dominant mineral phases x ray fluorescence xrf was conducted using a rigaku zsx primus ii xrf sequential wavelength dispersive spectrometer rigaku corporation japan to quantify the relative abundance of major and minor elements and zeta potential analysis was implemented using a zetasizer nano zs malvern instruments ltd worcestershire uk to measure the surface charge of the rocks under experimental conditions although core thickness will impact diffusion as it can change the pore matrix connectivity and rock capacity in terms of sorption and dead end pore volume the thinnest core width of 2 cm is adequate to accurately determine the diffusion coefficient valkiainen et al 1996 2 2 iodide and iodate sorption experiments iodide and iodate sorption onto the rock cores was investigated using a series of batch sorption experiments which were all run in triplicate core samples were ground up and sieved to obtain a size range between 150 and 500 μm then washed in tap water to remove fines sorption experiments were performed at a constant liquid to solid ratio by using 0 3 g of each rock core and 4 ml tap water electrolyte solutions the concentration of the background electrolyte and nature of the salt were varied to probe the effect of cations and anions on the resulting kd batch experiments were performed with 0 1 m nacl nabr or kcl to investigate the effects of cation or anion identity additional experiments were run with 0 01 m nacl and 1 m nacl to investigate the effects of ionic strength on iodine sorption sorption experiments were setup in 10 ml glass vials sealed using caps the rock samples were weighed individually in the glass vials and aliquots of the electrolyte solution were added to the samples and left to equilibrate for 2 days after equilibrating the solution and rock samples were amended with iodide or iodate solutions which were spiked with a radioiodine 129i tracer and equilibrated for 2 weeks on a shaker table at 50 rpm 129i decays through beta emission with a maximum energy of 154 4 kev fan et al 2013 a constant iodide or iodate concentration of 10 ppm was used for all experiments core a c samples were spiked with radioiodide and core d samples was spiked with radioiodate radioiodate 129io3 was prepared by bubbling chlorine gas generated in situ through a radioiodide 129i solution the solution turns brown after the initiation of chlorine gas bubbling then becomes clear after the transformation of i2 to io3 uv visible spectroscopy was used to make sure all iodide was transformed to iodate controls without rock materials were used to account for any iodine sorption to glass vials an identical set of sorption batch experiments was conducted outside of the radiological laboratory setting i e no radioiodine to monitor iodine speciation changes using uv vis at the completion of the equilibration time 1 ml of solution from each vial was sampled added to a liquid scintillation counting lsc vial and weighed to determine the exact amount of sample an aliquot of 16 ml of ultima gold scintillation cocktail perkinelmer inc waltham ma and 3 ml of di water were added to each vial liquid scintillation counting was then carried out using a quantulus 1220 ultra low level liquid scintillation counter perkinelmer inc waltham ma each sample was measured in triplicate for 15 min counts kd was calculated according to the following equation 1 k d c i v i c f v f c f m s where kd ml g is the adsorption distribution coefficient ci is the initial concentration of iodine in cpm ml counts per minute per ml cf is the final concentration of iodine cpm ml after equilibration with the rock core sediment vi and vf are the initial and final solution volumes and ms is the mass of sediment 2 3 diffusion cell set up prior to being placed in the diffusion cell the sides of the rock core were sealed to ensure that diffusion occurred in the axial direction rather than radially first the flat faces of the core were covered to prevent being contacted with silicone and the edges were coated in a silicone primer the core was then placed in a square mold which was filled with room temperature vulcanization rtv silicone silpak inc pomona ca usa and set overnight the set silicone provided a seal between the two water reservoirs that make up the diffusion cell once the rock cores were prepared they were submerged in los alamos municipal tap water see table s1 in the supporting information si for water composition and placed under vacuum to saturate these cores had been previously equilibrated with degassed tap water for diffusion studies and this water composition did not trigger mineral dissolution telfeyan et al 2018 cores were weighed daily and assumed to be saturated once they stopped gaining weight approximately two weeks cores were then transferred to the diffusion cell a schematic of which can be found in fig s2 in the si this cell consisted of two cylindrical reservoirs machined out of plexiglass the larger reservoir had a volume of approximately 900 or 1600 ml depending on the cell size and the smaller reservoir had a volume of approximately 120 or 200 ml this difference in volume minimizes concentration changes in the larger reservoir after being spiked with the tracer and anion of interest exact volumes for each cell were determined gravimetrically by weighing the empty cells and the cells filled with deionized di water table s2 in the si these precise volumes were used to calculate dilution factors the two reservoirs were placed on either side of the rock core and secured tightly against the silicone with screws reservoirs were filled with degassed los alamos municipal tap water ph 8 25 the cells that contained iodide were oriented on a stir plate with the larger reservoir on top and the smaller one on the bottom at these length scales the effect of gravity on diffusion is assumed to be negligible jackson 1964 a magnetic stir bar was placed in the smaller cell and it was stirred continuously during the diffusion period to prevent the formation of a concentration gradient at the mineral surface care was also taken to remove and prevent bubble formation in the smaller reservoir as that could impact the surface area for diffusion the diffusion cell that contained iodate was oriented on its side because of bubble formation due to the addition of a small amount of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 fisher scientific pittsburgh pa usa which was used to maintain oxidizing conditions needed to minimize the transformation of iodate to iodide 2 4 spiking and sampling procedure after preparing the diffusion cells the large reservoirs were spiked with d2o and potassium iodide ki 99 0 acs alfa aesar haverhill ma usa or potassium iodate kio3 99 4 acs acros organics fisher scientific waltham ma usa to obtain target concentrations of approximately 300 ppm d2o and 10 ppm iodide iodate after d2o addition it will quickly equilibrate with water to form deuterated water hdo allen and bayly 1976 thus measured diffusion values are for the hdo species for the two benham aquifer cores core a b in table 1 potassium iodide was used as the iodine species for the tiva canyon tuff two core samples cores c d in table 1 were utilized iodide diffusion was measured in core c and iodate diffusion was measured in core d these two cores provide a good basis of comparison for iodide versus iodate diffusion because they were taken from the same depth and have similar hydrogeological characteristics iodide i is the stable iodine species in our water chemistry as confirmed both experimentally section s4 in the si and using geochemist s workbench software v 12 rockware inc golden co to model the eh ph stability field fig s1 in the si additional testing was done to stabilize iodate through the addition of an oxidizing agent and a 0 015 v v h2o2 solution in tap water was found to be sufficient to stabilize iodate therefore both reservoirs of the iodate diffusion systems were spiked with h2o2 to 0 015 v v prior to addition of iodate after spiking the large reservoirs with d2o aldrich chemical company milwaukee wi and iodine the entire cell was inverted several times to ensure mixing and a sample was taken from the large reservoir to provide an initial concentration c0 approximately 0 5 ml samples were taken daily from the smaller reservoir and weighed to record their exact mass the removed volume was replaced by the same volume of degassed tap water or degassed tap water with 0 015 v v h2o2 this dilution was accounted for when calculating c c0 values samples were diluted with deionized di nanopure water on a mass basis for hdo measurement using a micromass isoprime continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms micromass manchester uk and a picarro l1115 i water isotope analyzer picarro inc santa clara ca usa after measurement they were diluted further for iodine measurement using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 2 5 effective diffusion coefficient calculation diffusion in these systems is characterized by the 1 d

using the diffcell computer code which employs an implicit finite difference method to solve eqn 2 3 and 4 numerically reimus et al 2002 the effective diffusion coefficient de was obtained in diffcell by manually varying the input de until the sum of squares for the experimental and modeled co t ci 0 difference was minimized 2 6 iodine speciation determination with uv visible spectroscopy to check for iodine speciation changes aqueous samples were analyzed using a cary 8454 uv visible diode array spectrophotometer agilent technologies santa clara ca due to the high background absorption of tap water below 210 nm analysis was limited to a wavelength range greater than 210 nm this range still allowed characterization of the relative contributions of iodide i iodate io3 and iodine i2 which have absorbance peaks at 226 nm 191 nm and 203 nm respectively uv vis absorption spectra were deconvoluted using gaussians for each peak of the form 5 a ν a max exp ν ν 0 2 2 σ 2 where amax is the maximum absorption of the peak ν0 is the wavenumber value where the peak occurs and σ is the full width at half maximum brown 2006 the gaussian curves for the three components were summed and differences between the combined calculated spectrum and measured spectrum were minimized using least squares analysis by adjusting amax and σ areas under the individual component curves were then summed to get estimates of their relative abundances 3 results 3 1 rock core mineralogy petrologic characterization of the four ue 20c rock cores used in this study was conducted on thin sections

associated with biotite and ilmenite a feti oxide with the chemical composition fetio3 3 2 iodine sorption results table 3 summarizes the kd values for iodide and iodate sorption measured under different electrolyte conditions the uncertainty on the values for many of the measured conditions are within the magnitude of kd and very small or negative values of kd indicate that these interactions are weak multiple studies have measured negative kd values for iodine onto other geologic material due to these weak interactions hu et al 2012 miller et al 2015 before considering whether there were any trends in the observed values we first conducted hypothesis testing to ensure that the calculated kd values were significantly different from zero excel was used to run t tests checking two hypotheses about the measured sorption data for this test the t statistic was calculated according to the following equation 6 t x 1 x 2 s p 2 n where x 1 and x 2 are the population means sp is the pooled standard deviation and n is the sample size the first hypothesis h1 was that the cpm ml values in the blanks and sample vials were different from one another the second h2 was that the change in cpm ml values in the blanks and sample vials was different from the standard deviation of the measurements for these analyses two tailed tests assuming equal variances of the populations were applied resulting p values can be found in table 3 the p value or probability value is an estimate of the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis if the p value is 0 05 or lower the null hypothesis is rejected meaning results are significant these values indicate that there is not an experimental system where the null could be rejected for both hypotheses thus there was no statistically significant observed or measurable sorption and we can assume that sorption is not a significant mechanism of iodine retardation in our matrices this observation is consistent with previous studies for example strickert et al 1980 reported kd values of 1 ml g for both iodide and iodate sorption onto tuff granite and dolomite while hu et al 2012 reported low kd values for sorption onto tuff of 0 068 and 0 209 ml g for iodide and iodate respectively in general anions such as iodide and iodate tend not to sorb strongly in the subsurface where neutral to alkaline ph values typically ranging between 6 and 8 lead to many minerals having a negative surface charge chowdhury et al 2011 we further measured the surface charge of the rock cores used in the diffusion experiments in tap water at the system ph of 8 3 0 1 the zeta potentials of the rock cores were 28 8 1 6 30 0 1 1 28 8 0 6 and 36 6 0 2 mv for cores a d respectively 3 3 effective diffusion coefficients breakthrough curves representing the normalized concentration c c0 of hdo i and io3 for the four diffusion experiments are shown in fig 3 dotted lines correspond with de values which are equal to 10 of the best fit de very few of the measured concentrations fall outside of this range indicating that this is a good fit for experimental data visual inspection reveals that iodide and iodate diffusion was significantly lower than that of the conservative tracer hdo for all rock cores studied best fit lines show the diffusion curves calculated using fitted de values and measured core characteristics including porosity and core geometry the effective diffusion coefficient is defined as van loon et al 2004 7 d e εδ τ d w where τ is the tortuosity factor δ is a constrictivity factor ε is the diffusion accessible porosity and dw is the molecular diffusion coefficient in water the shapes of these curves match the experimental data indicating that the model accurately reflects transport over the timeframe of the experimental study effective diffusion coefficients de calculated using the diffcell computer code for hdo and the iodine species are presented in table 4 values previously reported for 3hho diffusion through the same cores are also included in this table although telfeyan et al 2018 measured deuterated water diffusion as well they used a different method which had 15 30 variance from the diffusion cell method some of this error may be due to the difference in solute identity however it is not possible to distinguish this from method effects therefore comparisons were drawn only between our hdo measurements and 3hho measurements conducted using the same experimental set up de values for 3hho and hdo are in close agreement for lithophysae rich lava and welded tuff run with iodide as expected since 3hho and hdo should both transport conservatively however the de values for hdo in lithophysae poor lava and in the welded tuff core run with iodate were both slightly lower than that of 3hho previously determined for the same cores reasons for this are explored in section 4 4 there is currently limited data on iodide and iodate diffusion coefficients through the studied rock types however one study which included iodide diffusion through tuff measured a de of 7 10 11 m2 s close to our measured value of 9 76 10 11 m2 s kita et al 1989 4 discussion 4 1 minimal iodine sorption to volcanic rocks diffusion results revealed a number of interesting trends in iodine transport the first was that iodine matrix diffusion is significantly slower than that of hdo in all four systems studied the data also showed that the diffusion of io3 is slower than that of i we first considered whether this difference could be related to the sorption capacity of our rock cores for different iodine species as iodate tends to adsorb more strongly to geological materials than i kaplan et al 2014 neeway et al 2019 sorption experiments for iodide and iodate were carried out in the presence of various salt solutions to give insight into the sorption mechanism fig 4 iodine sorption in 0 1 m concentrations of nacl and kcl were compared to determine whether anion exchange is the dominant mechanism if iodine behavior were similar in the two systems with equal cl concentrations it would indicate such if interactions were instead controlled by the mineral surface charge equimolar concentrations of nacl and nabr should have the same sorption magnitude as they have equal na concentrations on the other hand if br competes with i or io3 for sorption sites this will be reflected by differences between nacl and nabr results finally varying the concentration of nacl can address whether formation of neutral nai aq species is facilitating sorption as has been proposed in the literature for iodide interactions with clay minerals miller et al 2015 as discussed in section 3 2 observation of sorption trends was made difficult by the low sorption quantities and measurement error statistical analysis indicated that sorption quantities are essentially equal to zero after considering measurement and replicate variation despite this we conducted theoretical fitting of the diffusion data for core a to observe how larger kd values may impact transport if they were true values what we found was that once the retardation factor rm exceeded 2 6 the fitted effective diffusion coefficient for iodide exceeded that of hdo this rm corresponds with a kd value of approximately 0 12 ml g within the measured error range for several of the experimental conditions this should not be physically possible considering the free water diffusion coefficient of hdo is higher than that of iodide this further confirms our conclusion that iodide and iodate are not sorbing significantly meaning that a separate mechanism is responsible for the observed retardation relative to the conservative tracer 4 2 iodine diffusion dependent on size and anion exclusion as sorption does not appear to play a role in the interaction of iodine species with the rock materials we considered whether size and or anion exclusion effects contributed to the observed retardation of iodide and iodate relative to hdo interactions between negatively charged solutes and surfaces will lead to anion exclusion a phenomenon well documented for anion transport through clays dagnelie et al 2018 the fact that all four volcanic rocks had a negative surface charge therefore further supports the predominance of the anion exclusion mechanism for iodine species diffusion in accordance with this mechanism the anion accessible porosity of a rock is smaller than its total porosity because negatively charged mineral surfaces will repel anions in solution wigger and van loon 2017 anion accessible porosity has been measured to be as low as 50 10 of the total porosity of claystones mazurek et al 2011 for both rhyolitic lava and welded tuff the mineralogy primarily consists of quartz and alkali feldspar plagioclase plus 1 2 iron containing minerals these were identified as primarily ilmenite an iron titanium oxide and biotite the phpzc of quartz feldspars ilmenite and biotite are 2 8 2 0 2 4 4 5 and 3 02 respectively meaning that these mineral surfaces will be negatively charged at the system ph of 8 25 another possible retention mechanism is diffusion into dead end pores however if this were the dominant mechanism we would expect diffusion to be even slower forhdo because smaller uncharged solutes tend to become trapped in dead end pores more readily than larger charged solutes shackelford and moore 2013 the magnitude of anion exclusion effects can be quantified by comparing calculated effective diffusion coefficients with free water diffusion coefficients rearranging eq 7 gives the following relationship 8 d w d e τ εδ the factor which includes τ δ and ε is often referred to in literature as the formation factor as it is describing the properties of the rock formation if molecules diffusing through the same rock experience the same effective tortuosity constrictivity and porosity the dw de ratio should be equivalent this ratio has been used previously to determine whether the charge or size of a diffusing molecule is impacting transport kozaki et al 1999 ohlsson and neretnieks 1997 the free water diffusion coefficient dw for hdo is 2 3 10 9 m2 s compared with 2 04 10 9 m2 s for iodide and 1 42 10 9 m2 s for iodate baur et al 1959 hanna et al 1982 experimentally derived hdo effective diffusion coefficients were thus 10 0 11 1 9 5 and 11 3 times smaller than free water diffusion coefficients for lithophysae rich lava lithophysae poor lava and welded tuffs with iodide and iodate respectively for iodine species measured values were 17 7 22 7 20 9 and 28 9 times smaller than the free water iodine diffusion coefficients for lithophysae rich lava core a lithophysae poor lava core b iodide in welded tuff core c and iodate in welded tuff core d respectively the larger relative decrease for iodine species is evidence to the effects of anion exclusion in the geologic matrix however this effect appeared to be strongest in the iodate system despite iodide and iodate having the same charge this observation indicates that size exclusion also takes place a large solute size hinders transport in porous media due to steric effects which decrease accessible porosity and increase friction with pore walls wernert et al 2010 li et al 2020 iodate has a larger hydrated anion size relative to iodide and it has the ability to influence the structure of water in its hydration shell through stronger hydrogen bonding chakrabarty and williams 2016 the larger iodate clusters will therefore experience lower diffusion accessible porosity and higher tortuosity constrictivity than iodide multiple studies have reported slower matrix diffusion for larger molecules due to decreases in accessible effective porosity and steric hindrance of transport into small pores or narrow pore throats anderson and quinn 1974 hu et al 2002 shackelford and moore 2013 wernert et al 2010 li et al 2020 while these findings indicate that anion exchange is a dominant retention mechanism additional experiments can be run to conclusively prove this case for example by increasing the ionic strength of the solution ionic interactions between the rock and diffusing species can be minimized van loon et al 2007 however this is outside the scope of the current study 4 3 iodide oxidation in lithophysae poor lava system among the three iodide diffusion systems the effective diffusion coefficient of hdo was 21 3 lower in the lithophysae poor lava core b compared to the previously measured tritiated water tracer value in lithophysae rich lava core a and welded tuff core c the hdo tracer de was nearly identical to the previous value table 4 in welded tuff core d which was run with iodate the hdo tracer de decreased by 18 8 as decreases of a similar magnitude were observed in cores b and d we became curious about the final oxidation state of iodine in core b and whether formation of iodate in this system could explain the observation for this facet of the study we focused on differences between the lithophysae rich core a and lithophysae poor core b systems as they were expected to be the most geochemically similar samples from late diffusion time points 1500 h for lithophysae rich lava and lithophysae poor lava were analyzed for their iodine speciation using uv vis fig 5 visual comparison shows obvious changes to the speciation between the two systems indicating that oxidation of iodide did occur in lithophysae poor lava deconvoluting the three peaks allows for rough estimation of the contribution of the three iodine species although this method does not precisely quantify the amount of oxidized iodide it captures the clearly visible spectra changes characteristic of the formation of oxidized iodine species for the lithophysae rich lava approximately 9 was oxidized to iodate or iodine whereas for the lithophysae poor lava approximately 29 was oxidized increased proportions of both i2 and io3 were observed using uv vis spectroscopy suggesting a mechanism whereby i is oxidized to io3 via an i2 precursor as is the case for oxidation by birnessite mno2 fox et al 2009 these findings were especially surprising given the thermodynamic stability of iodide under ambient conditions the lithophysae rich lava and lithophysae poor lava also have a similar bulk mineralogy as observed with xrf and thin section analysis additional geochemical characterization is needed to determine precisely why lithophysae poor lava presented a more oxidizing environment for diffusing iodide however previous studies indicate the potential for iodide oxidation to occur during diffusive transport as a result of geochemical interaction with the rock matrix multiple studies have attributed iodide oxidation to manganese oxides mno2 and species of nitrogen such as nitrate anschutz et al 2000 fox et al 2009 fox et al 2010 in another previous study fuhrmann et al 1998 found that their 125i tracer which was added as an i species oxidized to io3 within 15 days in the presence of biotite they assumed that this was due to oxygen in the air however i was stable in our system under ambient conditions we therefore hypothesize that geochemical interactions between iodide and minerals in the lithophysae poor lava system could contribute to the observed change in iodine speciation octahedral ferrous iron in biotite is susceptible to oxidation and previous analysis of fe2 fe3 ratios of biotite in lava found that the oxidized fraction ranged from 0 250 to 0 560 feldstein et al 1996 this ferric iron may oxidize iodide during diffusion through the matrix however more detailed analysis outside of the scope of the current study such as x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps or x ray absorption near edge spectroscopy xanes to examine the fe oxidation state is recommended as a future direction to explore differences in oxidizing mineral content within lithophysae rich and lithophysae poor lavas 4 4 iodate containing systems presented slower hdo diffusion the drop in hdo tracer de for cores b and d indicates that iodate presence may affect diffusion pathways for hdo in the rock matrix the effective diffusion coefficient is a product of the free water diffusion coefficient matrix tortuosity effective porosity and constrictivity as shown in eq 7 telfeyan et al 2018 one indicator of matrix tortuosity and constrictivity is the hydraulic conductivity lower conductivity for approximately the same porosity can be caused by both tighter constrictions in pore spaces i e more constrictivity and by a less straight forward flow path i e more tortuosity and will impact both iodine and hdo diffusion we therefore examined whether the presence of iodate coincides with altered hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic conductivities of the two welded tuff cores were re measured after diffusion experiments using the falling head method for welded tuff core c which was run with iodide the hydraulic conductivity was 1 41 0 19 10 8 cm s compared with 1 47 10 8 cm s measured by telfeyan et al 2018 before the diffusion study these differences are well within the error of the measurements for welded tuff core d which was run with iodate the hydraulic conductivity was 1 16 0 09 10 8 cm s after the diffusion study compared with 2 45 10 8 cm s before the study with this difference in mind we measured the hydraulic conductivity in the lithophysae poor lava system after the diffusion study and fount that it decreased from 5 00 10 7 cm s to 2 10 0 13 10 7 cm s thus the presence of iodate does appear to correspond with a changing matrix pore structure as reflected in decreasing hydraulic conductivity values while this finding is secondary to the goal of this study which was measuring the diffusion coefficients for iodine species we feel that it is important to note the exact mechanism of this observation however is not currently known and requires further targeted experimentation the fact that iodate was formed and stable in cores b and d despite iodide being the stable species in the degassed tap water solution indicates the presence of locally oxidizing microenvironments within pore matrices thus even in anoxic subsurface environments similar geochemical interactions may occur this oxidizing environment may have triggered dissolution and secondary mineral precipitation reactions which altered the matrix structure affecting diffusive transport precipitation impacting diffusive transport has been reported on a similar time scale to our diffusion experiments chagneau et al 2015 luquot et al 2014 pfingsten et al 2006 however more investigations are needed to determine whether our experimental conditions are sufficient to trigger precipitation extensive enough to impact the pore network regardless of the exact mechanism results presented here clearly indicate the importance of considering iodine speciation changes and potential geochemical reactions during subsurface transport 5 conclusions new insights into iodine matrix diffusion achieved in this study are key to predict the risk associated with a subsurface radioiodine release and more accurately monitor for clandestine nuclear activity for instance while the observed lower effective diffusion coefficients for iodide limit transport through intact rock a lower effective diffusion coefficient means iodide transport can be more efficient through fractures in the normal case for iodine release into crystalline bedrock fractures and fracture zones are always present furthermore when considering iodine as a une signature without significant diffusion into the adjacent matrix iodine species may transport more quickly relative to other fission products contributing to fractionation and changing its isotopic ratio relative to other nuclear isotopic signatures understanding and removing these fractionation effects from isotopic ratios are important tools used to distinguish une signatures from other background radionuclide sources e g medical isotope production facilities and commercial nuclear power plants variations in diffusion between the rock types and iodine species highlight the importance of considering both geochemistry and water composition when characterizing subsurface transport reactive transport calculations used for risk assessments must fully incorporate these factors additional studies of iodide and iodate diffusion through lava flow and tuff samples from other sites are also recommended

1474,the rare earth element ree group is widely used for geochemical prospection and the hydrochemical differentiation of waters most of the currently applied methods use normalized ree patterns to determine enrichments or depletions of certain ree in comparison to standard materials which are caused by specific environmental conditions contrast agents containing gadolinium gd which are used for magnetic resonance imaging mri have been emitted into surface waters since the 1980s patients excrete these contrast agents shortly after ambulant medication in hospitals or at home sewage treatment is currently unable to hold back gd from this anthropogenic source therefore the gd concentration in the receiving channel increases significantly and creates a gd peak in the ree pattern this anthropogenic peak propagates into adjacent groundwater bodies in a karst aquifer showing a connection between a river ponor input and three springs output such an anthropogenic gd anomaly has been traced the local gd background quantified and surface water groundwater interaction evaluated in two sampling campaigns water samples were taken every day at the input and output side during one week in february and three weeks in may sampling of springs and brooks in the vicinity of the karst aquifer proved excessive gd from anthropogenic sources the evaluation of concentration mass flow and total mass of gd show that gd can be an environmental tracer to monitor surface water groundwater interaction as well as the anthropogenic influence on water bodies further anthropogenic pollutants diclofenac carbamazepine galaxolide caffeine and acesulfame k representing different classes of common organic substances were tested as co indicators to gd however out of these only acesulfame k was detected and is related with the gd anomaly our results indicate that gd is a more powerful indicator of surface water groundwater interaction than most organic pollutants keywords rare earth elements ree gadolinium gd gd background concentration environmental tracer karst sewage water surface water groundwater interaction 1 introduction karst aquifers are a major freshwater source around the world and the geomorphological and hydrogeological characteristics of karst create springs with relatively large discharges and large catchments one geomorphological characteristic of karst are ponors swallow holes where river water descends partly or completely underground in many cases this water discharges in springs directly connected to the upstream ponor ford and williams 2007 henry and suk 2018 as the stream water descends through the ponor the natural attenuation such as removal of suspended solids and pathogenic microbes biodegradation and adsorption is less compared e g to bank filtration because the groundwater flow in karst conduits is too rapid for these processes to be effective therefore karst aquifers are very vulnerable to anthropogenic influences the surface water might contain anthropogenic contaminants and without treatment poses a threat for the use of the spring water e g for the public water supply dew and hötzl 1999 ford and williams 2007 henry and suk 2018 white et al 2018 since the 1980s gadolinium gd complexes are used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging mri due to their increasing application the gd concentration levels in aquatic environments increase as well lawrence 2010 kulaksız and bau 2013 tepe et al 2014 merschel et al 2015 hatje et al 2016 mri uses very stable gd complexes which pass the human body un metabolized depending on the complex patients excrete the contrast agents containing gd 1 5 to 30 h after injection idée et al 2006 conventional sewage systems cannot remove them from wastewater lawrence et al 2009 cyris 2013 pp 82 even hospitals with special wastewater treatment emit gd kümmerer and helmers 2000 kümmerer 2001 but as practitioners apply mri diagnostics as well hospitals are not the only source of anthropogenic gd emissions gd has become an indicator of municipal sewage in general verplanck et al 2005 verplanck et al 2010 birka et al 2013 2016 naturally the rare earth elements ree are widespread in the environment and show patterns reflecting the element concentrations in rock and soil mclennan 1982 henderson 1984 taylor and mclennan 1985 1995 and or the environmental conditions of the analyzed material guo et al 2010 laveuf et al 2012 petrosino et al 2013 because of this characteristic the ree are a tool in mineral exploration rock formation determination hallis et al 2014 gaschnig et al 2016 and hydrothermal process modeling göb et al 2013 chudaev et al 2017 these patterns are altered by the release of gd mri contrast agents into surface waters via municipal sewage in densely populated areas as well as in rural areas because the patients excrete the gd complex in the hospital or at home kümmerer and helmers 2000 kümmerer 2001 seemingly gd emissions in the environment are related to point sources like discharge from wastewater treatment plants wwtp this possible source coincides with gd anomalies in the environment petrosino et al 2013 and almost all wwtp in western countries are sources of gd as the vast majority of people have access to mri treatment cyris 2013 lindner 2017 the emissions result in a widespread anthropogenic gd anomaly of the ree pattern in surface water bau and dulski 1996 möller et al 2000 kulaksız and bau 2011 hatje et al 2016 the gd complexes are very stable in the environment leading to conservative behavior in some cases such anomalies were measured over long distances in rivers verplanck et al 2005 petelet giraud et al 2009 rabiet et al 2009 verplanck et al 2010 klaver et al 2014 and the signal accumulates over time merschel et al 2015 hatje et al 2016 as the practitioners and the hospitals work mainly on weekdays the anthropogenic gd anomalies show a transient signal in the surface water as well as in adjacent groundwater influenced by bank filtration in such coupled systems it is possible to trace the surface water in the underground transit time is a key parameter for the aquifer system that can be calculated from water mixing and water flux data based on the gd anomaly furthermore transient signals in bank filtrate show how powerful gd is as an environmental tracer for bank filtration and groundwater with surface water portions bichler et al 2016 brünjes et al 2016 in case of bank filtration for freshwater production larger porous media aquifers and single wells the anthropogenic gd anomaly has been used as a tracer to support other tracer analysis and to calculate groundwater travel times johannesson et al 1997 massmann et al 2007 lawrence and bariel 2010 schwesig and bergmann 2011 previous investigations of anthropogenic gd anomalies use it as indicator for anthropogenic influence on surface water and groundwater in heavily polluted and densely populated areas where many point sources wwtp overlap each other and overprint the transient signals of weekdays or small emission changes dilution and adsorption effects might play a significant role as well but are not easy to evaluate although it has been shown that not only wwtps are unable to remove the anthropogenic gd from the water cycle neither can water treatment plants wtp the elevated gd concentration reaches even tap water for example in berlin kulaksız and bau 2011 tepe et al 2014 there artificial recharge from treated wastewater caused a gd anomaly in groundwater and raw water for drinking water supply massmann et al 2004 2008 tepe et al 2014 combining anthropogenic gd as an environmental tracer with other anthropogenic organic pollutants proved to be a good approach in many cases where they show similar behavior especially acesulfame was used in several studies and supports results of gd analyses at least over short infiltration distances engelhardt et al 2014 bichler et al 2016 although its environmental stability is questionable kahl et al 2018 this study comprises the situation of a cuesta in germany where the local river descends partly into a karst aquifer by a set of ponors at the riverbank and contributes to the discharge of three interconnected freely draining springs the main objective of this research is to show the environmental tracer capabilities of gd over long distances in a karst aquifer which exhibits high flow velocities between surface water input and output as the chosen aquifer system was investigated already in the 1990s using dye tracers conclusions from the gd signal can be evaluated by the results of these earlier studies additionally the study site offers a versatile application of gd as an environmental tracer furthermore overall and water type specific geogenic background values are calculated from the many data of this study applying a statistical method agreed by the environmental and geological surveys of the german laender and the federal republic 1 1 study site the study site is located fig 1 upper left black rectangle in the map of germany in a mesozoic sedimentary rock sequences of germany the land use of the area itself is dominated by agriculture forests occupy higher plateaus which are separated from each other by narrower and wider valleys of the local rivers and creeks as a result the surface waters create different catchments on the surface by eroding the triassic platform and forming cuestas with separate groundwater bodies the settlements locate mainly on the riverbanks in the broader valleys fig 1 just a few small villages with up to a few hundred inhabitants reside on the plateaus around 15 000 people live within the study area covering roughly 30 km2 an important geomorphologic feature is the river streu blue line in fig 1 flowing from the village nordheim in the northwest to unsleben in the south traveling through mellrichstadt and mittelstreu where the springs are located mittelstreuer quellen the streu embraces a central plateau which is the primary recharge area for the local aquifer and the springs fig 1 1 2 geology at the study site sedimentary rocks of lower mesozoic triassic age form the main geological units the lowermost members are sandstones with claystones at the top of the buntsandstein forming the regional base of the aquifer system of interest limestones of the middle triassic muschelkalk are the next overlying unit the lower and middle members of the muschelkalk form a landscape with plateaus thinly covered with soil in the valleys and close to the rivers fluvial sediments cover the triassic rocks the overall dip of the sedimentary rocks is to the southwest up to 140 m thick limestones are the main aquifer of the study site a few wells drilled on the plateaus indicate the karst water table at 40 to 60 m depth below the surface reder and parchwitz 2013 in the study area the streu has eroded into the karstified limestones and seeps partially into several ponors swallow holes marked as input in fig 1 former dye tracer tests confirmed connecting karst conduits to the main springs of the study area i e the mittelstreuer quellen marked as output in the southern section in fig 1 earlier investigations including tracer tests confirm groundwater flow velocities between 125 and 3000 m d hofmann et al 1991 reder and parchwitz 2013 the distance between ponors and springs is approximately 7500 m the mittelstreuer quellen are three interconnected karst springs spreading over approximately 50 m along the hillside toe all three are used for the local drinking water supply one pipe collects the discharge of all three springs and directs it to the water treatment plant wtp approximately 700 m southeast of the springs fig 1 the sampled water represents mixed spring water hofmann et al 1991 reder and parchwitz 2013 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling at three different sampling campaigns in 2017 and 2018 water samples were taken at the study first in summer 2017 six samples were taken at different locations at a ponor of the streu near the village of stockheim fig 1 at the wtp before and after the treatment process and at the three individual springs the bavarian environmental protection agency bavarian epa mirrored this sample collection and analyzed the samples in its own laboratory in parallel at the river s ponor we took the sample where the water showed a visible swirl and seeped into the aquifer with a stainless steel scoop in situ parameters t ph ec d o orp were measured with handheld wtw devices at two sampling locations in the wtp samples were taken directly from the pipes of untreated and treated water the in situ parameters were measured in a flow cell connected to the pipes three more samples were directly taken at the spring tapings again a stainless steel scoop was used and the in situ measurements conducted as described before at all sites the samples were filled into 500 ml pe bottles after the cooled transport back from the sampling locations two 100 ml aliquots of each sample were taken to the laboratories at the rwth in aachen for major ions and the jülich research centre jrc for ree all the samples taken in 2017 were filtered with a 0 45 μm filter major ions were measured by ion chromatography metrohm 790 personal ic following en iso 14911 1999 and din en iso 10304 1 2009 07 bicarbonate was measured with an automated titrator metrohm as acid capacity at ph 4 3 following din 38409 7 2005 12 the ion balance of all samples was in a range of 5 to 5 the ree analyses were carried out at the jrc with a quadrupole icp ms agilent 7500ce helium mode directly out of the sample matrix the agilent 7500ce was calibrated for the whole ree spectrum using a multi element standard but optimized for gd rhodium was added as internal standard and blanks were measured to account for laboratory background furthermore two time series of water samples were taken at the ponor and the springs in 2018 the two auto samplers installed in february one at the ponor and another one in the wtp at the raw water side sampled every four hours for 9 days it was sufficient to take the water samples in the wtp after the mixing inlet pipe as the three karst springs are interconnected the latter is indicated by the same water chemistry and equal reaction of their discharge to changes in run off and precipitation hofmann et al 1991 reder and parchwitz 2013 to be able to compare the winter and summer situation in may june 2018 the third campaign used the same sampling setup but sampling one water sample per day three on 18th may for 22 days in total in total 91 samples for ree analysis were taken in february and 49 in may june all samples were transported cooled to aachen filtered 0 45 μm and analyzed for ree as described above as indicated in fig 1 the sampling in 2018 took place at two points one in the input and one in the output area blue points the blue point in the output area however is in the water treatment plant there it was easier to access the water of all three springs directly from now on the two points are referred to as ponor input and springs output a permanent measuring point of the bavarian flood news service upstream in nordheim provided the discharge data of the streu as daily mean shortly before the ponor another creek joins the streu and is instantaneously measured by the authorities as well the information of these two river discharges was used to calculate the river runoff at the sampling location unpublished research by reder from 2011 on the infiltration of the streu water into the karst system along the river s path discharge measurements is the origin for estimations how much water of the discharge in nordheim reaches the input sampling point just upstream of stockheim fig 1 in this research reder shows that 25 30 of the river water descends into the aquifer in the ponors section as a result the assumption is that 70 of the combined water of the streu and the tributary creek reaches sampling reder 2011 provided the data to quantify the swallowing of river water between ostheim and stockheim furthermore the local water supplier measures the discharges of the three springs separately these data were obtained and combined to daily means as one water sample was taken per day the discharges of the ponor location and the springs location were summarized to daily averages fig 1 assuming every measured sample represents the gd concentration of one day the combined discharge of the springs and the infiltration corrected discharge of the river are the discharges for the mass flow and total mass calculations in addition 20 one liter samples were taken in may june 2018 in glass bottles for the measurement of organic pollutants that stand for different anthropogenic sewage influences on water bodies the five analyzed contaminants are acesulfame k food caffeine food diclofenac pharmaceuticals carbamazepine pharmaceuticals galaxolide personal care products of these 20 samples seven were taken at the auto sampled input location and eight at the auto sampled output location to study changes over time five samples were taken along the streu to show the concentration fluctuations along its path sgs fresenius lc ms ms and spe gcms only for galaxolide measured these five anthropogenic pollutants during may june 2018 38 water samples were collected in the catchment area using 500 ml pe bottles the samples originate from rivers springs and village wells and determine environmental background values of gd in situ parameters were measured at the location the samples were filtered with 0 45 μm and two 100 ml aliquots of every sample were analyzed at the rwth in aachen for major ions and at the jülich research centre jrc for ree as described above 2 2 verification of analytics the bavarian epa uses an agilent 7800 without collision cell no gas mode to analyze the ree the agilent is calibrated with a three point method 0 1 μg l 0 5 μg l and 2 0 μg l and re was added as an internal standard the epa compares its ree measurements at every sampling location at least once with samples that were pre concentrated by solid phase extraction spe before the measurement by icp ms in these cases the sample preparation and measurement procedure are the same as described by bau and dulski 1996 as a result the direct measurements of the ree concentrations done at the bavarian epa are related to the pre concentrated samples and show the validity of the direct measurement based on this experience the two laboratories show similar results in the analyses directly out of the matrices table 1 the obtained gd concentrations display on average a 10 difference for river and spring samples and 26 for wtp samples regarding all uncertainties in the sampling and measuring process these differences can be seen as verification of the results it is evident that both laboratories use methods which are equally suitable for the gd analysis all following ree measurements at the study site were done by direct measurement of a sample aliquot at the jrc laboratory the internal standards and blanks show that the analysis works reliably the limit of quantification for the gd concentration is 1 ng l hence the chosen method for the ree analysis works well at all study sites and is rapid and cost effective 2 3 geogenic gd background calculation natural gd background concentration is an important measure to evaluate the tracer potential for anthropogenic influences on surface and groundwater one possibility is to assume that the ree pattern is predetermined by the samples environment rocks water type etc and calculate the geogenic background of gd to its neighboring ree this approach assumes that just gd alters the ree pattern emitted with mri contrast agents therefore the peak above the line between samarium and terbium represents the anthropogenic gd input black arrows fig 2 fig 2 shows the normalized ree patterns in surface water and groundwater and the anthropogenic anomaly the lower and upper ree patterns envelope all analyzed samples the red arrows in fig 2 point to the significant differences of background values using the method mentioned above if the ree analyses just measure gd quantitatively in the direct analysis of gd the rees beside gd were measured semi quantitatively to optimize the measurement for gd as the goal is to use the concentration of the single element gd as environmental tracer the method should be easier faster and more efficient therefore the method shows variations in the gd background in this study s samples fig 2 these changes are not explicable and earlier studies do not mention this effect europium is excluded because of interferences with bao and baoh in the icp ms measurements as was shown by duvert et al 2015 barium was not measured in his study as the bavarian epa established some years ago background values for groundwater of the muschelkalk and the buntsandstein in bavaria wagner et al 2003 the rocks of the study site have the same habitus as the described geological formations and they show 106 μg l ba in the muschelkalk n 65 median 76 4 μg l 25th percentile 58 4 μg l 75th percentile 142 μg l and 128 μg l in the buntsandstein n 168 median 91 2 μg l 25th percentile 54 3 μg l 75th percentile 156 μg l in the literature positive and negative anomalies of eu are known yuan et al 2014 he et al 2011 gill et al 2018 and specific elements are not shown in the pattern as in fig 2 if necessary telgmann et al 2016 as the ree pattern method does not give an absolute value of gd background we analyzed a large number of samples 214 in total for calculating the geogenic gd background statistically two different approaches have been used and compared to evaluate statistical properties of the gd concentration of the complete data set and of subsets both statistical analyses assume a normal distribution of the geogenic background measuring several times the same water body the measured background values should follow a normal distribution at first all the analyses were classified according to water type study site and sampling location or campaign the statistical analysis was done for these different selections of the project s data set using the two approaches the first statistical approach uses the average and its standard deviation erhardt et al 1996 investigated standardized grass cultures to evaluate the accumulation of air pollutants routinely they determined element concentrations at background levels and defined thresholds for significantly elevated pollutants in individual grass culture series the derived threshold valued is universally applicable and their method is not limited to grass cultures but is suitable for the evaluation of thresholds in general to differentiate between background values and anomalies in a normal distribution 97 5 of the population plots within 1 96 times the standard deviation therefore it is assumed that all values higher than the average plus 1 96 times standard deviation are anomalies the method uses this definition to calculate a threshold value delete all measurements above that threshold and calculates the new threshold for the reduced population the iterative process results in a reduction of the population until just the normally distributed measurements in a specific range remain erhardt et al 1996 the geological surveys and epas of the german laender and the state established another method for background calculations wagner et al 2011 walter et al 2012 the surveys use probability nets which display normal or lognormal distributions as straight lines and distribution mixtures as straight line segments in a semi logarithmic plot of a distribution s cumulative frequency lepeltier 1969 stanley and sinclair 1989 sinclair 1991 because of the iterative exclusion of anomalies in the calculation a trend line can be fitted to a part of the data considered as a normal or lognormal distributed background population from the slope and intercept of the best fit which represents the underlying populations standard deviation and mean the assumed normal distribution s percentiles can be calculated the surveys and epas use the 90th or the 95th percentile as an upper limit of the background these values plot higher than the change of slopes which define the difference between the background population and anthropogenic influence therefore in the case of gd the threshold value of the background is set at the change from the lowest linear segment into a transition zone to the non normal distribution the 90th and 95th percentile are an extrapolation calculated with the distribution parameters of the background population it might be more precise in some cases to use the distribution turning point concentration as geogenic background in cases where this transition is not clearly visible in the graph the 90th percentile was taken as the threshold for the anthropogenic influence on any given sample all calculations were done using probnet developed by walter et al 2012 fig 3 shows an example of a probnet analysis of the geogenic background for gd in ng l in the example all the analyses of surface and groundwater were taken collectively in fig 3 56 out of 214 data sets were used to calculate the background distribution s percentiles and the distribution parameters mean standard deviation minimum median maximum but all displayed data points in fig 3 were kept in probnet furthermore the excel application does a d agostino pearson test on the distribution and calculates the fit of the calculated distribution and the original dataset r 0 9919 lognormal deleting more of the anomalies results in a normal distribution as indicated in fig 3 therefore a normal background population is assumed and the 90th percentile is used as a threshold in this case the two methods in use for background calculations need at least three to five analyses to produce a background value and from 10 data points onwards the background is statistically confirmed as table 2 shows the number of samples for the muschelkalk formation is quite low 7 in total that is due to the fact that just samples of the wider catchment area are part of the estimation which appoint to the respective formation background is given with one standard deviation the background calculations indicate differences in the geogenic background for subsets of the complete sample set whereas the differences between the methods of 1 4 ng l for all samples is a result of the different data processing in general the probability plots deal much better with few data points and iterative reduction works well with homogeneous data and large data sets for the springs both methods show similar background values and the differences for the catchment as well as the ponor are due to the surface water signals in both sample sets for the time series at the springs and the sinkhole in winter and summer the gd background concentrations calculated by the probability method are applied although the excel program probnet will produce reliable natural concentration distributions from ten measurements onwards it is possible to use it to get an estimate of the geogenic background even with three data points the standard deviation relies on the distribution of the input data from the analyses but the probability plot method fills the data gaps with a calculated background distribution in the cases of springs and ponor the background in table 2 represents the cut off between geogenic baseline and anthropogenic peaks for samples which come from the same sampling locations fig 1 and represent a time series furthermore the permanent influence of sewage in the river streu might have reached a background level already altered in comparison to the natural gd concentration tepe et al 2014 hatje et al 2016 which the iterative reduction method indicates for the catchment and the ponor consequently the geogenic background of the ponor 2 95 ng l is higher than in the groundwater springs 2 15 ng l gd both methods lead to higher backgrounds in the sample set of the 38 samples taken in the catchment of the springs that is due to higher sample heterogeneity as samples from surface water rivers and lakes and groundwater village wells and springs are analyzed together the samples coming from the catchment give an idea about the general gd concentrations in the area surface water and groundwater the surface water samples resemble the concentrations of the streu the groundwater samples of the two main hydrogeologic formations at the study site buntsandstein and muschelkalk show different gd concentrations and a geology specific background the geology specific background was determined by clearly assignable groundwater samples analyzed with iterative reduction method the buntsandstein samples 15 indicate a gd background of 4 1 1 2 ng l in the muschelkalk formation seven water samples have an average geogenic gd concentration of 2 2 0 3 ng l and correspond well with the wtp value of the probability plot 3 results and discussion the results consist of three data types first the ree concentrations at the two sampling sites ponor and springs in summer and winter second the ree concentrations of the samples in the wider study area which define the more detailed geogenic background concentrations of gd and third the analysis of five organic pollutants which have the same emission path wastewater in the study area as gd the second type includes the spring discharge measurements and the calculation of realistic river run off at the sampling point for the streu ponor 3 1 anthropogenic gd infiltration summer in the summer sampling campaign water was sampled and analyzed over 22 days fig 4 shows high anthropogenic gd concentrations at the ponor sampling site and the springs both time series fig 4 constitute the originally measured gd concentrations subtracted by the calculated gd background values for the surface water ponor 2 95 ng l and groundwater springs 2 15 ng l the time series exhibit a strong weekly signal although the time between the peaks varies a bit in the ponor signal the sinkhole has four distinct peaks and the springs just three a possible reason is the attenuation of the input signal brünjes et al 2016 already reported a similar transient signal of a gd concentration at a bank filtration site here the distance between the two sampling sites is much larger and the alteration of the signal is different furthermore the comparison with the spring discharge and river run off data shows that the concentration of gd is not sufficient as a parameter to relate the input and output signal for instance it shows the slow increase of the baseline in the springs gd concentration that there is a connection to fluctuations in the three springs yield if the gd emissions are constant together the three springs have a discharge of 408 l s at the beginning of the measuring period and the yield declines gradually to 359 l s at the end in the case of the river run off the discharge fluctuates in a wider range around 368 l s min 294 l s max 581 l s median 336 l s the gd concentrations between 8 ng l and 48 ng l are higher as the signal of the springs 4 and 16 ng l the observed concentrations of gd are comparable to the background concentrations published for aquifers and surface waters by noack et al 2014 and bichler et al 2016 to verify the assumed connection between the springs and the sinkhole hofmann et al 1991 udluft 1996 reder and parchwitz 2013 mass flow and total mass calculations erase the discharge influence and give a more precise picture of the gd masses underway in the karst system 3 2 mass flow and gd total mass summer observing the mass flow and gd total mass in summer fig 5 the ponor mass flow shows four peaks thursday wednesday sunday and saturday they occur one day earlier as the concentration peaks and still display a weekly signal with slightly shifting periods in between this is a result of the timely and spatially overlapping emission signals more than one wastewater treatment plant along the river and different emission times lead to an attenuated weekly signal in contrast to the ponor the springs constitute a very regular set of peaks every friday the mass flow difference between the spring and the ponor peaks keeps the relation of one to three 1 3 the total mass shows that 12 4 g gd passed the sinkhole during the measuring period and the springs emitted 3 1 g of gd fig 5 in the same period as a result the springs bear 25 of the gd that passes the input point which suggests a mixing ratio of about 20 river water in the discharge of the three springs with the other 80 coming from groundwater recharge the steepness and the changes of the total mass graphs represent different emission regimes and show like the mass flow that the weekly emissions can vary but come quite regularly with increases of 1 2 g d gd in the groundwater the gd seems to have an even longer cyclic signal as the gd mass flow increases after every cycle and does not fall back to the concentration of gd at the cycle s beginning if that is due to another underlying gd signal with a much longer cycle and lower concentrations anomalies or is already the impending destruction of the natural gd distribution is beyond the scope of the manuscript the destruction of the geogenic gd background was already mentioned for rivers but might be traceable in groundwater bodies as well kulaksız and bau 2013 merschel et al 2015 hatje et al 2016 gd surface water mass flow and total mass signals are a least ten times higher than the calculated geogenic background signal the mass flow of gd in the system creates an environmental tracer that exposes the properties of the karst system qualitatively and quantitatively as mentioned two different publications concerning the distance velocities between the sinkholes and springs exist for the study area udluft 1996 reder and parchwitz 2013 if the three peaks fig 5 of the spring signal relate to the first three peaks of the ponor signal they represent a distance velocity fig 5 blue arrows the mean time difference between the mass flow peaks in green and blue fig 5 is three days n 3 extrapolation of a fourth peak in the spring signal would lead to a peak two days after the end of the timeline and the peak should be lower than the one before to match the pattern with this assumption in mind the calculated flow velocity would be 2500 m d that velocity plots in between the two already published flow velocities form the early 1990s of 125 m d hofmann et al 1991 and 1996 3000 m d udluft 1996 reder and parchwitz 2013 the 2500 m d support the later finding and relate quite well as karst conduits and conditions of the tracer tests from 1993 differ from the situation in may june 2018 to proof that the 125 m d velocity is too low the two sampling sites should be analyzed for 90 consecutive days the resulting timelines should show the real recurring time of the peaks the three week period of this study is too short to resolve this question finally furthermore the assumption is that the only influence on the gd signal is dilution reports of other influences on the environmental behavior of gd in karst aquifers with medium to high distance velocities are not known 3 3 mass flow and total mass of gd winter the influence of the runoff conditions on the gd concentration signal is in winter at least as important as in the summer period between the 5th and 13th of february 2018 the three spring s discharge is 30 higher compared to may june but decreases gradually from 630 l s to 601 l s over the 9 days the river gives a fluctuating runoff around 1089 l s min 854 l s max 1505 l s median 1031 l s again mass flow and total mass calculations are used to compare the ponor and the springs without discharge influence another advantage is the comparability with the summer situation in fig 6 the mass flow displays one peak during these nine days at the ponor furthermore the mass flow at the springs is slowly increasing over the whole period and does not show any peak the gd total mass is the cumulative graph of the flow mass in the given time span the gd signal at the input location of the sinkhole is not visible in the springs yet as the mass flow is linearly increasing over the measuring period the measuring time might not be long enough to exhibit a possible peak from the input site in the output data fig 6 all the gd running through the points adds up enabling a direct comparison of the gd input and output the river carried almost twenty times more gd than the springs 5 8 g at the ponor and 0 31 g at the springs during the nine days in february the winter situation does not show mass flows as high as in the summer nor as distinct peaks or the connection of the surface water signal in the spring discharge furthermore the comparison of the total mass shows that just 5 6 of the spring discharge comes directly from the river in summer 20 of the three spring s discharge comes directly from surface water infiltration although more surface water is in the system in winter and the spring yield is higher 230 l s more water from the three springs and around 700 l s more runoff in the river the snow melt and or precipitation during winter lead to an increased share of groundwater recharge in the discharge of the three springs as a result the anthropogenic gd signal of the surface water is so heavily diluted that it can hardly be seen fig 6 the dilution effect in winter mention other studies as well hissler et al 2014 this seasonal comparison indicates that the connection between the ponors in the north and the three springs in the south of the karst plateau relies on certain karst conduits which are already fully used in summer in winter the descent of the surface water is physically limited by the size of the ponors at some point the increase of river flow is not further transferred into the underground and their share of the spring water decreases relatively by a factor of four in case of using gd as environmental tracer at such sites summer would be the season of choice because of the low run off conditions in the karst system the signal will be more pronounced easier to find and better to interpret the comparison of a high and low run off condition adds to the already known mixing calculations johannesson et al 1997 liu et al 2017 an intertemporal view with some other implications as it might look like there was more gd emitted in summer compared to winter it is important to consider the different sampling periods an extrapolation of the nine days in february with the same mass flow would end up after 22 days with a total mass of 14 2 g in the ponor and 0 86 g in the springs the difference between the summer and winter gd mass passing the sinkhole sampling point is just 1 9 g 14 2 g in winter minus 12 3 g in summer or 13 15 whereas in the springs due to the higher share of river water in their discharge during the summer period more than three times the mass of gd in winter pass through the springs the total gd mass in the system stays more or less the same while the gd mass measured and extrapolated in winter would be 15 06 g and the sum of surface water and groundwater in summer is 15 4 g the overall emission of gd in the investigated study area and the karst system does not change between seasons in 2018 showing a difference of 2 to evaluate if this is also true over several years or if the emission level changes further research and multi annual time series at the same sampling locations would be necessary as some publications indicate an increasing gd signal altering the geogenic background already kulaksız and bau 2013 tepe et al 2014 merschel et al 2015 hatje et al 2016 3 4 correlation of gd and acesulfame k along with the gd analysis 20 samples were taken to analyze five organic contaminants these have the same source municipal sewage as gd in the study area acesulfame k scheurer et al 2011 caffeine priegnitz 2007 carbamazepine scheurer et al 2011 cary et al 2013 diclofenac tixier et al 2003 and galaxolide schwarzbauer and ricking 2010 guven et al 2015 got measured as they are often cited as environmental tracers and or sewage tracers caffeine carbamazepine and galaxolide were below the limit of quantification in all samples and diclofenac was determined in just low concentrations in the river water samples acesulfame k contrastingly has been quantified in all 20 samples taken in the summer campaign seven at the ponor eight at the springs and five samples along the river streu to evaluate the changes in the flow path the samples are not regularly distributed over the whole time as the total number of measurements was limited to 20 however the acesulfame k signal in the 15 samples displayed in fig 7 corresponds with the gd concentrations the river water groundwater and acesulfame k exhibit similar concentration trends although the concentration of acesulfame k is much higher μg l in the groundwater the acesulfame k concentration fits the gd concentration trend and represents another contaminant showing that the source of gd is the municipal sewage furthermore gd is a far better environmental tracer as the chosen anthropogenic pollutants only acesulfame k might be another suitable tracer at the study site it was already used in comparison with gd bichler et al 2016 although publications proved its biodegradability lately kahl et al 2018 4 conclusion the study proves the comprehensive applicability of gd as environmental tracer for the interaction of surface water and groundwater in karst it can be a tool to investigate or monitor wastewater influences on water bodies in general hence it is important to know the geogenic background of gd in the water types and aquifer systems in question the statistical calculation of the background using probability plots combines statistics and expert knowledge of the geological and environmental conditions by visualizing the value distribution of the measurements this advantage allows for defining geogenic gd backgrounds regarding hydrogeological units and water bodies at the study site the gd background is determined at 2 95 0 5 ng l in the surface water and at 2 15 0 5 ng l in the groundwater spring water furthermore an iterative reduction method is used to define gd background concentrations for two aquifer strata at the study site the muschelkalk geogenic gd background is 2 2 0 1 ng l and 6 6 1 6 ng l in the buntsandstein this information enables the quantification of the anthropogenic gd signal that shows a weekly cycle between low and high concentrations in surface water and groundwater the seasonal comparison of summer and winter illustrates the limitations of the tracer in groundwater in winter the groundwater has a larger share of the precipitation feeded recharge than descending surface waters reducing the infiltration share in spring water at the study site due to the short measuring period in winter the groundwater signal increases over nine days but does not show a specific peak and displays low concentration between the detection limit and 2 ng l under dry weather conditions and more stable run off the gd signals in surface water and groundwater are higher concentration and mass flow change more steadily and a single measurement can be sufficient for a valid conclusion for example whether an anthropogenic gd anomaly exists a comparison of the total gd mass running through the sampled sites shows that over the time of the two sampling periods approximately the same mass of gd is emitted in the system this is maybe the result of the high degree of capacity utilization of mri instruments at least in germany resulting in a very steady release of mri contrast agents into the water cycle along the year concentration and shape of peaks are however changing because of dilution and traveling time in the groundwater the gd signal is mixed with uncontaminated waters from infiltrated precipitation in the spring catchment leading to a contribution of swallowed surface water of around 5 6 in winter and 20 in summer beside the mixing ratio calculation and detailed information about the interaction the gd mass flow enables flow velocity calculations if the peaks in surface water and groundwater are corresponding a further result is that the signal is attenuated in the aquifer leading to a lower amplitude and more regular appearance of gd peaks in the groundwater seven days but a third or less of the surface water peak finally the comparison with acesulfame k showed that gd has the same source as many other anthropogenic pollutants but is a better environmental tracer for municipal sewage in water than other anthropogenic pollutants compared in this study except acesulfame k mri contrast agents have a high environmental stability at least compared to the analyzed anthropogenic substances the gd signal behaves more conservative compared to other anthropogenic substances and is measurable even after their decay to sum up the measurement of gd proves to be a powerful tool for the investigation of surface water groundwater interaction for anthropogenic influence from municipal waste water on waters and can be analyzed in a cost effective and fast if high performance icp ms instruments are used acknowledgements many thanks to mr thomas walter of the environmental protection

1474,the rare earth element ree group is widely used for geochemical prospection and the hydrochemical differentiation of waters most of the currently applied methods use normalized ree patterns to determine enrichments or depletions of certain ree in comparison to standard materials which are caused by specific environmental conditions contrast agents containing gadolinium gd which are used for magnetic resonance imaging mri have been emitted into surface waters since the 1980s patients excrete these contrast agents shortly after ambulant medication in hospitals or at home sewage treatment is currently unable to hold back gd from this anthropogenic source therefore the gd concentration in the receiving channel increases significantly and creates a gd peak in the ree pattern this anthropogenic peak propagates into adjacent groundwater bodies in a karst aquifer showing a connection between a river ponor input and three springs output such an anthropogenic gd anomaly has been traced the local gd background quantified and surface water groundwater interaction evaluated in two sampling campaigns water samples were taken every day at the input and output side during one week in february and three weeks in may sampling of springs and brooks in the vicinity of the karst aquifer proved excessive gd from anthropogenic sources the evaluation of concentration mass flow and total mass of gd show that gd can be an environmental tracer to monitor surface water groundwater interaction as well as the anthropogenic influence on water bodies further anthropogenic pollutants diclofenac carbamazepine galaxolide caffeine and acesulfame k representing different classes of common organic substances were tested as co indicators to gd however out of these only acesulfame k was detected and is related with the gd anomaly our results indicate that gd is a more powerful indicator of surface water groundwater interaction than most organic pollutants keywords rare earth elements ree gadolinium gd gd background concentration environmental tracer karst sewage water surface water groundwater interaction 1 introduction karst aquifers are a major freshwater source around the world and the geomorphological and hydrogeological characteristics of karst create springs with relatively large discharges and large catchments one geomorphological characteristic of karst are ponors swallow holes where river water descends partly or completely underground in many cases this water discharges in springs directly connected to the upstream ponor ford and williams 2007 henry and suk 2018 as the stream water descends through the ponor the natural attenuation such as removal of suspended solids and pathogenic microbes biodegradation and adsorption is less compared e g to bank filtration because the groundwater flow in karst conduits is too rapid for these processes to be effective therefore karst aquifers are very vulnerable to anthropogenic influences the surface water might contain anthropogenic contaminants and without treatment poses a threat for the use of the spring water e g for the public water supply dew and hötzl 1999 ford and williams 2007 henry and suk 2018 white et al 2018 since the 1980s gadolinium gd complexes are used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging mri due to their increasing application the gd concentration levels in aquatic environments increase as well lawrence 2010 kulaksız and bau 2013 tepe et al 2014 merschel et al 2015 hatje et al 2016 mri uses very stable gd complexes which pass the human body un metabolized depending on the complex patients excrete the contrast agents containing gd 1 5 to 30 h after injection idée et al 2006 conventional sewage systems cannot remove them from wastewater lawrence et al 2009 cyris 2013 pp 82 even hospitals with special wastewater treatment emit gd kümmerer and helmers 2000 kümmerer 2001 but as practitioners apply mri diagnostics as well hospitals are not the only source of anthropogenic gd emissions gd has become an indicator of municipal sewage in general verplanck et al 2005 verplanck et al 2010 birka et al 2013 2016 naturally the rare earth elements ree are widespread in the environment and show patterns reflecting the element concentrations in rock and soil mclennan 1982 henderson 1984 taylor and mclennan 1985 1995 and or the environmental conditions of the analyzed material guo et al 2010 laveuf et al 2012 petrosino et al 2013 because of this characteristic the ree are a tool in mineral exploration rock formation determination hallis et al 2014 gaschnig et al 2016 and hydrothermal process modeling göb et al 2013 chudaev et al 2017 these patterns are altered by the release of gd mri contrast agents into surface waters via municipal sewage in densely populated areas as well as in rural areas because the patients excrete the gd complex in the hospital or at home kümmerer and helmers 2000 kümmerer 2001 seemingly gd emissions in the environment are related to point sources like discharge from wastewater treatment plants wwtp this possible source coincides with gd anomalies in the environment petrosino et al 2013 and almost all wwtp in western countries are sources of gd as the vast majority of people have access to mri treatment cyris 2013 lindner 2017 the emissions result in a widespread anthropogenic gd anomaly of the ree pattern in surface water bau and dulski 1996 möller et al 2000 kulaksız and bau 2011 hatje et al 2016 the gd complexes are very stable in the environment leading to conservative behavior in some cases such anomalies were measured over long distances in rivers verplanck et al 2005 petelet giraud et al 2009 rabiet et al 2009 verplanck et al 2010 klaver et al 2014 and the signal accumulates over time merschel et al 2015 hatje et al 2016 as the practitioners and the hospitals work mainly on weekdays the anthropogenic gd anomalies show a transient signal in the surface water as well as in adjacent groundwater influenced by bank filtration in such coupled systems it is possible to trace the surface water in the underground transit time is a key parameter for the aquifer system that can be calculated from water mixing and water flux data based on the gd anomaly furthermore transient signals in bank filtrate show how powerful gd is as an environmental tracer for bank filtration and groundwater with surface water portions bichler et al 2016 brünjes et al 2016 in case of bank filtration for freshwater production larger porous media aquifers and single wells the anthropogenic gd anomaly has been used as a tracer to support other tracer analysis and to calculate groundwater travel times johannesson et al 1997 massmann et al 2007 lawrence and bariel 2010 schwesig and bergmann 2011 previous investigations of anthropogenic gd anomalies use it as indicator for anthropogenic influence on surface water and groundwater in heavily polluted and densely populated areas where many point sources wwtp overlap each other and overprint the transient signals of weekdays or small emission changes dilution and adsorption effects might play a significant role as well but are not easy to evaluate although it has been shown that not only wwtps are unable to remove the anthropogenic gd from the water cycle neither can water treatment plants wtp the elevated gd concentration reaches even tap water for example in berlin kulaksız and bau 2011 tepe et al 2014 there artificial recharge from treated wastewater caused a gd anomaly in groundwater and raw water for drinking water supply massmann et al 2004 2008 tepe et al 2014 combining anthropogenic gd as an environmental tracer with other anthropogenic organic pollutants proved to be a good approach in many cases where they show similar behavior especially acesulfame was used in several studies and supports results of gd analyses at least over short infiltration distances engelhardt et al 2014 bichler et al 2016 although its environmental stability is questionable kahl et al 2018 this study comprises the situation of a cuesta in germany where the local river descends partly into a karst aquifer by a set of ponors at the riverbank and contributes to the discharge of three interconnected freely draining springs the main objective of this research is to show the environmental tracer capabilities of gd over long distances in a karst aquifer which exhibits high flow velocities between surface water input and output as the chosen aquifer system was investigated already in the 1990s using dye tracers conclusions from the gd signal can be evaluated by the results of these earlier studies additionally the study site offers a versatile application of gd as an environmental tracer furthermore overall and water type specific geogenic background values are calculated from the many data of this study applying a statistical method agreed by the environmental and geological surveys of the german laender and the federal republic 1 1 study site the study site is located fig 1 upper left black rectangle in the map of germany in a mesozoic sedimentary rock sequences of germany the land use of the area itself is dominated by agriculture forests occupy higher plateaus which are separated from each other by narrower and wider valleys of the local rivers and creeks as a result the surface waters create different catchments on the surface by eroding the triassic platform and forming cuestas with separate groundwater bodies the settlements locate mainly on the riverbanks in the broader valleys fig 1 just a few small villages with up to a few hundred inhabitants reside on the plateaus around 15 000 people live within the study area covering roughly 30 km2 an important geomorphologic feature is the river streu blue line in fig 1 flowing from the village nordheim in the northwest to unsleben in the south traveling through mellrichstadt and mittelstreu where the springs are located mittelstreuer quellen the streu embraces a central plateau which is the primary recharge area for the local aquifer and the springs fig 1 1 2 geology at the study site sedimentary rocks of lower mesozoic triassic age form the main geological units the lowermost members are sandstones with claystones at the top of the buntsandstein forming the regional base of the aquifer system of interest limestones of the middle triassic muschelkalk are the next overlying unit the lower and middle members of the muschelkalk form a landscape with plateaus thinly covered with soil in the valleys and close to the rivers fluvial sediments cover the triassic rocks the overall dip of the sedimentary rocks is to the southwest up to 140 m thick limestones are the main aquifer of the study site a few wells drilled on the plateaus indicate the karst water table at 40 to 60 m depth below the surface reder and parchwitz 2013 in the study area the streu has eroded into the karstified limestones and seeps partially into several ponors swallow holes marked as input in fig 1 former dye tracer tests confirmed connecting karst conduits to the main springs of the study area i e the mittelstreuer quellen marked as output in the southern section in fig 1 earlier investigations including tracer tests confirm groundwater flow velocities between 125 and 3000 m d hofmann et al 1991 reder and parchwitz 2013 the distance between ponors and springs is approximately 7500 m the mittelstreuer quellen are three interconnected karst springs spreading over approximately 50 m along the hillside toe all three are used for the local drinking water supply one pipe collects the discharge of all three springs and directs it to the water treatment plant wtp approximately 700 m southeast of the springs fig 1 the sampled water represents mixed spring water hofmann et al 1991 reder and parchwitz 2013 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling at three different sampling campaigns in 2017 and 2018 water samples were taken at the study first in summer 2017 six samples were taken at different locations at a ponor of the streu near the village of stockheim fig 1 at the wtp before and after the treatment process and at the three individual springs the bavarian environmental protection agency bavarian epa mirrored this sample collection and analyzed the samples in its own laboratory in parallel at the river s ponor we took the sample where the water showed a visible swirl and seeped into the aquifer with a stainless steel scoop in situ parameters t ph ec d o orp were measured with handheld wtw devices at two sampling locations in the wtp samples were taken directly from the pipes of untreated and treated water the in situ parameters were measured in a flow cell connected to the pipes three more samples were directly taken at the spring tapings again a stainless steel scoop was used and the in situ measurements conducted as described before at all sites the samples were filled into 500 ml pe bottles after the cooled transport back from the sampling locations two 100 ml aliquots of each sample were taken to the laboratories at the rwth in aachen for major ions and the jülich research centre jrc for ree all the samples taken in 2017 were filtered with a 0 45 μm filter major ions were measured by ion chromatography metrohm 790 personal ic following en iso 14911 1999 and din en iso 10304 1 2009 07 bicarbonate was measured with an automated titrator metrohm as acid capacity at ph 4 3 following din 38409 7 2005 12 the ion balance of all samples was in a range of 5 to 5 the ree analyses were carried out at the jrc with a quadrupole icp ms agilent 7500ce helium mode directly out of the sample matrix the agilent 7500ce was calibrated for the whole ree spectrum using a multi element standard but optimized for gd rhodium was added as internal standard and blanks were measured to account for laboratory background furthermore two time series of water samples were taken at the ponor and the springs in 2018 the two auto samplers installed in february one at the ponor and another one in the wtp at the raw water side sampled every four hours for 9 days it was sufficient to take the water samples in the wtp after the mixing inlet pipe as the three karst springs are interconnected the latter is indicated by the same water chemistry and equal reaction of their discharge to changes in run off and precipitation hofmann et al 1991 reder and parchwitz 2013 to be able to compare the winter and summer situation in may june 2018 the third campaign used the same sampling setup but sampling one water sample per day three on 18th may for 22 days in total in total 91 samples for ree analysis were taken in february and 49 in may june all samples were transported cooled to aachen filtered 0 45 μm and analyzed for ree as described above as indicated in fig 1 the sampling in 2018 took place at two points one in the input and one in the output area blue points the blue point in the output area however is in the water treatment plant there it was easier to access the water of all three springs directly from now on the two points are referred to as ponor input and springs output a permanent measuring point of the bavarian flood news service upstream in nordheim provided the discharge data of the streu as daily mean shortly before the ponor another creek joins the streu and is instantaneously measured by the authorities as well the information of these two river discharges was used to calculate the river runoff at the sampling location unpublished research by reder from 2011 on the infiltration of the streu water into the karst system along the river s path discharge measurements is the origin for estimations how much water of the discharge in nordheim reaches the input sampling point just upstream of stockheim fig 1 in this research reder shows that 25 30 of the river water descends into the aquifer in the ponors section as a result the assumption is that 70 of the combined water of the streu and the tributary creek reaches sampling reder 2011 provided the data to quantify the swallowing of river water between ostheim and stockheim furthermore the local water supplier measures the discharges of the three springs separately these data were obtained and combined to daily means as one water sample was taken per day the discharges of the ponor location and the springs location were summarized to daily averages fig 1 assuming every measured sample represents the gd concentration of one day the combined discharge of the springs and the infiltration corrected discharge of the river are the discharges for the mass flow and total mass calculations in addition 20 one liter samples were taken in may june 2018 in glass bottles for the measurement of organic pollutants that stand for different anthropogenic sewage influences on water bodies the five analyzed contaminants are acesulfame k food caffeine food diclofenac pharmaceuticals carbamazepine pharmaceuticals galaxolide personal care products of these 20 samples seven were taken at the auto sampled input location and eight at the auto sampled output location to study changes over time five samples were taken along the streu to show the concentration fluctuations along its path sgs fresenius lc ms ms and spe gcms only for galaxolide measured these five anthropogenic pollutants during may june 2018 38 water samples were collected in the catchment area using 500 ml pe bottles the samples originate from rivers springs and village wells and determine environmental background values of gd in situ parameters were measured at the location the samples were filtered with 0 45 μm and two 100 ml aliquots of every sample were analyzed at the rwth in aachen for major ions and at the jülich research centre jrc for ree as described above 2 2 verification of analytics the bavarian epa uses an agilent 7800 without collision cell no gas mode to analyze the ree the agilent is calibrated with a three point method 0 1 μg l 0 5 μg l and 2 0 μg l and re was added as an internal standard the epa compares its ree measurements at every sampling location at least once with samples that were pre concentrated by solid phase extraction spe before the measurement by icp ms in these cases the sample preparation and measurement procedure are the same as described by bau and dulski 1996 as a result the direct measurements of the ree concentrations done at the bavarian epa are related to the pre concentrated samples and show the validity of the direct measurement based on this experience the two laboratories show similar results in the analyses directly out of the matrices table 1 the obtained gd concentrations display on average a 10 difference for river and spring samples and 26 for wtp samples regarding all uncertainties in the sampling and measuring process these differences can be seen as verification of the results it is evident that both laboratories use methods which are equally suitable for the gd analysis all following ree measurements at the study site were done by direct measurement of a sample aliquot at the jrc laboratory the internal standards and blanks show that the analysis works reliably the limit of quantification for the gd concentration is 1 ng l hence the chosen method for the ree analysis works well at all study sites and is rapid and cost effective 2 3 geogenic gd background calculation natural gd background concentration is an important measure to evaluate the tracer potential for anthropogenic influences on surface and groundwater one possibility is to assume that the ree pattern is predetermined by the samples environment rocks water type etc and calculate the geogenic background of gd to its neighboring ree this approach assumes that just gd alters the ree pattern emitted with mri contrast agents therefore the peak above the line between samarium and terbium represents the anthropogenic gd input black arrows fig 2 fig 2 shows the normalized ree patterns in surface water and groundwater and the anthropogenic anomaly the lower and upper ree patterns envelope all analyzed samples the red arrows in fig 2 point to the significant differences of background values using the method mentioned above if the ree analyses just measure gd quantitatively in the direct analysis of gd the rees beside gd were measured semi quantitatively to optimize the measurement for gd as the goal is to use the concentration of the single element gd as environmental tracer the method should be easier faster and more efficient therefore the method shows variations in the gd background in this study s samples fig 2 these changes are not explicable and earlier studies do not mention this effect europium is excluded because of interferences with bao and baoh in the icp ms measurements as was shown by duvert et al 2015 barium was not measured in his study as the bavarian epa established some years ago background values for groundwater of the muschelkalk and the buntsandstein in bavaria wagner et al 2003 the rocks of the study site have the same habitus as the described geological formations and they show 106 μg l ba in the muschelkalk n 65 median 76 4 μg l 25th percentile 58 4 μg l 75th percentile 142 μg l and 128 μg l in the buntsandstein n 168 median 91 2 μg l 25th percentile 54 3 μg l 75th percentile 156 μg l in the literature positive and negative anomalies of eu are known yuan et al 2014 he et al 2011 gill et al 2018 and specific elements are not shown in the pattern as in fig 2 if necessary telgmann et al 2016 as the ree pattern method does not give an absolute value of gd background we analyzed a large number of samples 214 in total for calculating the geogenic gd background statistically two different approaches have been used and compared to evaluate statistical properties of the gd concentration of the complete data set and of subsets both statistical analyses assume a normal distribution of the geogenic background measuring several times the same water body the measured background values should follow a normal distribution at first all the analyses were classified according to water type study site and sampling location or campaign the statistical analysis was done for these different selections of the project s data set using the two approaches the first statistical approach uses the average and its standard deviation erhardt et al 1996 investigated standardized grass cultures to evaluate the accumulation of air pollutants routinely they determined element concentrations at background levels and defined thresholds for significantly elevated pollutants in individual grass culture series the derived threshold valued is universally applicable and their method is not limited to grass cultures but is suitable for the evaluation of thresholds in general to differentiate between background values and anomalies in a normal distribution 97 5 of the population plots within 1 96 times the standard deviation therefore it is assumed that all values higher than the average plus 1 96 times standard deviation are anomalies the method uses this definition to calculate a threshold value delete all measurements above that threshold and calculates the new threshold for the reduced population the iterative process results in a reduction of the population until just the normally distributed measurements in a specific range remain erhardt et al 1996 the geological surveys and epas of the german laender and the state established another method for background calculations wagner et al 2011 walter et al 2012 the surveys use probability nets which display normal or lognormal distributions as straight lines and distribution mixtures as straight line segments in a semi logarithmic plot of a distribution s cumulative frequency lepeltier 1969 stanley and sinclair 1989 sinclair 1991 because of the iterative exclusion of anomalies in the calculation a trend line can be fitted to a part of the data considered as a normal or lognormal distributed background population from the slope and intercept of the best fit which represents the underlying populations standard deviation and mean the assumed normal distribution s percentiles can be calculated the surveys and epas use the 90th or the 95th percentile as an upper limit of the background these values plot higher than the change of slopes which define the difference between the background population and anthropogenic influence therefore in the case of gd the threshold value of the background is set at the change from the lowest linear segment into a transition zone to the non normal distribution the 90th and 95th percentile are an extrapolation calculated with the distribution parameters of the background population it might be more precise in some cases to use the distribution turning point concentration as geogenic background in cases where this transition is not clearly visible in the graph the 90th percentile was taken as the threshold for the anthropogenic influence on any given sample all calculations were done using probnet developed by walter et al 2012 fig 3 shows an example of a probnet analysis of the geogenic background for gd in ng l in the example all the analyses of surface and groundwater were taken collectively in fig 3 56 out of 214 data sets were used to calculate the background distribution s percentiles and the distribution parameters mean standard deviation minimum median maximum but all displayed data points in fig 3 were kept in probnet furthermore the excel application does a d agostino pearson test on the distribution and calculates the fit of the calculated distribution and the original dataset r 0 9919 lognormal deleting more of the anomalies results in a normal distribution as indicated in fig 3 therefore a normal background population is assumed and the 90th percentile is used as a threshold in this case the two methods in use for background calculations need at least three to five analyses to produce a background value and from 10 data points onwards the background is statistically confirmed as table 2 shows the number of samples for the muschelkalk formation is quite low 7 in total that is due to the fact that just samples of the wider catchment area are part of the estimation which appoint to the respective formation background is given with one standard deviation the background calculations indicate differences in the geogenic background for subsets of the complete sample set whereas the differences between the methods of 1 4 ng l for all samples is a result of the different data processing in general the probability plots deal much better with few data points and iterative reduction works well with homogeneous data and large data sets for the springs both methods show similar background values and the differences for the catchment as well as the ponor are due to the surface water signals in both sample sets for the time series at the springs and the sinkhole in winter and summer the gd background concentrations calculated by the probability method are applied although the excel program probnet will produce reliable natural concentration distributions from ten measurements onwards it is possible to use it to get an estimate of the geogenic background even with three data points the standard deviation relies on the distribution of the input data from the analyses but the probability plot method fills the data gaps with a calculated background distribution in the cases of springs and ponor the background in table 2 represents the cut off between geogenic baseline and anthropogenic peaks for samples which come from the same sampling locations fig 1 and represent a time series furthermore the permanent influence of sewage in the river streu might have reached a background level already altered in comparison to the natural gd concentration tepe et al 2014 hatje et al 2016 which the iterative reduction method indicates for the catchment and the ponor consequently the geogenic background of the ponor 2 95 ng l is higher than in the groundwater springs 2 15 ng l gd both methods lead to higher backgrounds in the sample set of the 38 samples taken in the catchment of the springs that is due to higher sample heterogeneity as samples from surface water rivers and lakes and groundwater village wells and springs are analyzed together the samples coming from the catchment give an idea about the general gd concentrations in the area surface water and groundwater the surface water samples resemble the concentrations of the streu the groundwater samples of the two main hydrogeologic formations at the study site buntsandstein and muschelkalk show different gd concentrations and a geology specific background the geology specific background was determined by clearly assignable groundwater samples analyzed with iterative reduction method the buntsandstein samples 15 indicate a gd background of 4 1 1 2 ng l in the muschelkalk formation seven water samples have an average geogenic gd concentration of 2 2 0 3 ng l and correspond well with the wtp value of the probability plot 3 results and discussion the results consist of three data types first the ree concentrations at the two sampling sites ponor and springs in summer and winter second the ree concentrations of the samples in the wider study area which define the more detailed geogenic background concentrations of gd and third the analysis of five organic pollutants which have the same emission path wastewater in the study area as gd the second type includes the spring discharge measurements and the calculation of realistic river run off at the sampling point for the streu ponor 3 1 anthropogenic gd infiltration summer in the summer sampling campaign water was sampled and analyzed over 22 days fig 4 shows high anthropogenic gd concentrations at the ponor sampling site and the springs both time series fig 4 constitute the originally measured gd concentrations subtracted by the calculated gd background values for the surface water ponor 2 95 ng l and groundwater springs 2 15 ng l the time series exhibit a strong weekly signal although the time between the peaks varies a bit in the ponor signal the sinkhole has four distinct peaks and the springs just three a possible reason is the attenuation of the input signal brünjes et al 2016 already reported a similar transient signal of a gd concentration at a bank filtration site here the distance between the two sampling sites is much larger and the alteration of the signal is different furthermore the comparison with the spring discharge and river run off data shows that the concentration of gd is not sufficient as a parameter to relate the input and output signal for instance it shows the slow increase of the baseline in the springs gd concentration that there is a connection to fluctuations in the three springs yield if the gd emissions are constant together the three springs have a discharge of 408 l s at the beginning of the measuring period and the yield declines gradually to 359 l s at the end in the case of the river run off the discharge fluctuates in a wider range around 368 l s min 294 l s max 581 l s median 336 l s the gd concentrations between 8 ng l and 48 ng l are higher as the signal of the springs 4 and 16 ng l the observed concentrations of gd are comparable to the background concentrations published for aquifers and surface waters by noack et al 2014 and bichler et al 2016 to verify the assumed connection between the springs and the sinkhole hofmann et al 1991 udluft 1996 reder and parchwitz 2013 mass flow and total mass calculations erase the discharge influence and give a more precise picture of the gd masses underway in the karst system 3 2 mass flow and gd total mass summer observing the mass flow and gd total mass in summer fig 5 the ponor mass flow shows four peaks thursday wednesday sunday and saturday they occur one day earlier as the concentration peaks and still display a weekly signal with slightly shifting periods in between this is a result of the timely and spatially overlapping emission signals more than one wastewater treatment plant along the river and different emission times lead to an attenuated weekly signal in contrast to the ponor the springs constitute a very regular set of peaks every friday the mass flow difference between the spring and the ponor peaks keeps the relation of one to three 1 3 the total mass shows that 12 4 g gd passed the sinkhole during the measuring period and the springs emitted 3 1 g of gd fig 5 in the same period as a result the springs bear 25 of the gd that passes the input point which suggests a mixing ratio of about 20 river water in the discharge of the three springs with the other 80 coming from groundwater recharge the steepness and the changes of the total mass graphs represent different emission regimes and show like the mass flow that the weekly emissions can vary but come quite regularly with increases of 1 2 g d gd in the groundwater the gd seems to have an even longer cyclic signal as the gd mass flow increases after every cycle and does not fall back to the concentration of gd at the cycle s beginning if that is due to another underlying gd signal with a much longer cycle and lower concentrations anomalies or is already the impending destruction of the natural gd distribution is beyond the scope of the manuscript the destruction of the geogenic gd background was already mentioned for rivers but might be traceable in groundwater bodies as well kulaksız and bau 2013 merschel et al 2015 hatje et al 2016 gd surface water mass flow and total mass signals are a least ten times higher than the calculated geogenic background signal the mass flow of gd in the system creates an environmental tracer that exposes the properties of the karst system qualitatively and quantitatively as mentioned two different publications concerning the distance velocities between the sinkholes and springs exist for the study area udluft 1996 reder and parchwitz 2013 if the three peaks fig 5 of the spring signal relate to the first three peaks of the ponor signal they represent a distance velocity fig 5 blue arrows the mean time difference between the mass flow peaks in green and blue fig 5 is three days n 3 extrapolation of a fourth peak in the spring signal would lead to a peak two days after the end of the timeline and the peak should be lower than the one before to match the pattern with this assumption in mind the calculated flow velocity would be 2500 m d that velocity plots in between the two already published flow velocities form the early 1990s of 125 m d hofmann et al 1991 and 1996 3000 m d udluft 1996 reder and parchwitz 2013 the 2500 m d support the later finding and relate quite well as karst conduits and conditions of the tracer tests from 1993 differ from the situation in may june 2018 to proof that the 125 m d velocity is too low the two sampling sites should be analyzed for 90 consecutive days the resulting timelines should show the real recurring time of the peaks the three week period of this study is too short to resolve this question finally furthermore the assumption is that the only influence on the gd signal is dilution reports of other influences on the environmental behavior of gd in karst aquifers with medium to high distance velocities are not known 3 3 mass flow and total mass of gd winter the influence of the runoff conditions on the gd concentration signal is in winter at least as important as in the summer period between the 5th and 13th of february 2018 the three spring s discharge is 30 higher compared to may june but decreases gradually from 630 l s to 601 l s over the 9 days the river gives a fluctuating runoff around 1089 l s min 854 l s max 1505 l s median 1031 l s again mass flow and total mass calculations are used to compare the ponor and the springs without discharge influence another advantage is the comparability with the summer situation in fig 6 the mass flow displays one peak during these nine days at the ponor furthermore the mass flow at the springs is slowly increasing over the whole period and does not show any peak the gd total mass is the cumulative graph of the flow mass in the given time span the gd signal at the input location of the sinkhole is not visible in the springs yet as the mass flow is linearly increasing over the measuring period the measuring time might not be long enough to exhibit a possible peak from the input site in the output data fig 6 all the gd running through the points adds up enabling a direct comparison of the gd input and output the river carried almost twenty times more gd than the springs 5 8 g at the ponor and 0 31 g at the springs during the nine days in february the winter situation does not show mass flows as high as in the summer nor as distinct peaks or the connection of the surface water signal in the spring discharge furthermore the comparison of the total mass shows that just 5 6 of the spring discharge comes directly from the river in summer 20 of the three spring s discharge comes directly from surface water infiltration although more surface water is in the system in winter and the spring yield is higher 230 l s more water from the three springs and around 700 l s more runoff in the river the snow melt and or precipitation during winter lead to an increased share of groundwater recharge in the discharge of the three springs as a result the anthropogenic gd signal of the surface water is so heavily diluted that it can hardly be seen fig 6 the dilution effect in winter mention other studies as well hissler et al 2014 this seasonal comparison indicates that the connection between the ponors in the north and the three springs in the south of the karst plateau relies on certain karst conduits which are already fully used in summer in winter the descent of the surface water is physically limited by the size of the ponors at some point the increase of river flow is not further transferred into the underground and their share of the spring water decreases relatively by a factor of four in case of using gd as environmental tracer at such sites summer would be the season of choice because of the low run off conditions in the karst system the signal will be more pronounced easier to find and better to interpret the comparison of a high and low run off condition adds to the already known mixing calculations johannesson et al 1997 liu et al 2017 an intertemporal view with some other implications as it might look like there was more gd emitted in summer compared to winter it is important to consider the different sampling periods an extrapolation of the nine days in february with the same mass flow would end up after 22 days with a total mass of 14 2 g in the ponor and 0 86 g in the springs the difference between the summer and winter gd mass passing the sinkhole sampling point is just 1 9 g 14 2 g in winter minus 12 3 g in summer or 13 15 whereas in the springs due to the higher share of river water in their discharge during the summer period more than three times the mass of gd in winter pass through the springs the total gd mass in the system stays more or less the same while the gd mass measured and extrapolated in winter would be 15 06 g and the sum of surface water and groundwater in summer is 15 4 g the overall emission of gd in the investigated study area and the karst system does not change between seasons in 2018 showing a difference of 2 to evaluate if this is also true over several years or if the emission level changes further research and multi annual time series at the same sampling locations would be necessary as some publications indicate an increasing gd signal altering the geogenic background already kulaksız and bau 2013 tepe et al 2014 merschel et al 2015 hatje et al 2016 3 4 correlation of gd and acesulfame k along with the gd analysis 20 samples were taken to analyze five organic contaminants these have the same source municipal sewage as gd in the study area acesulfame k scheurer et al 2011 caffeine priegnitz 2007 carbamazepine scheurer et al 2011 cary et al 2013 diclofenac tixier et al 2003 and galaxolide schwarzbauer and ricking 2010 guven et al 2015 got measured as they are often cited as environmental tracers and or sewage tracers caffeine carbamazepine and galaxolide were below the limit of quantification in all samples and diclofenac was determined in just low concentrations in the river water samples acesulfame k contrastingly has been quantified in all 20 samples taken in the summer campaign seven at the ponor eight at the springs and five samples along the river streu to evaluate the changes in the flow path the samples are not regularly distributed over the whole time as the total number of measurements was limited to 20 however the acesulfame k signal in the 15 samples displayed in fig 7 corresponds with the gd concentrations the river water groundwater and acesulfame k exhibit similar concentration trends although the concentration of acesulfame k is much higher μg l in the groundwater the acesulfame k concentration fits the gd concentration trend and represents another contaminant showing that the source of gd is the municipal sewage furthermore gd is a far better environmental tracer as the chosen anthropogenic pollutants only acesulfame k might be another suitable tracer at the study site it was already used in comparison with gd bichler et al 2016 although publications proved its biodegradability lately kahl et al 2018 4 conclusion the study proves the comprehensive applicability of gd as environmental tracer for the interaction of surface water and groundwater in karst it can be a tool to investigate or monitor wastewater influences on water bodies in general hence it is important to know the geogenic background of gd in the water types and aquifer systems in question the statistical calculation of the background using probability plots combines statistics and expert knowledge of the geological and environmental conditions by visualizing the value distribution of the measurements this advantage allows for defining geogenic gd backgrounds regarding hydrogeological units and water bodies at the study site the gd background is determined at 2 95 0 5 ng l in the surface water and at 2 15 0 5 ng l in the groundwater spring water furthermore an iterative reduction method is used to define gd background concentrations for two aquifer strata at the study site the muschelkalk geogenic gd background is 2 2 0 1 ng l and 6 6 1 6 ng l in the buntsandstein this information enables the quantification of the anthropogenic gd signal that shows a weekly cycle between low and high concentrations in surface water and groundwater the seasonal comparison of summer and winter illustrates the limitations of the tracer in groundwater in winter the groundwater has a larger share of the precipitation feeded recharge than descending surface waters reducing the infiltration share in spring water at the study site due to the short measuring period in winter the groundwater signal increases over nine days but does not show a specific peak and displays low concentration between the detection limit and 2 ng l under dry weather conditions and more stable run off the gd signals in surface water and groundwater are higher concentration and mass flow change more steadily and a single measurement can be sufficient for a valid conclusion for example whether an anthropogenic gd anomaly exists a comparison of the total gd mass running through the sampled sites shows that over the time of the two sampling periods approximately the same mass of gd is emitted in the system this is maybe the result of the high degree of capacity utilization of mri instruments at least in germany resulting in a very steady release of mri contrast agents into the water cycle along the year concentration and shape of peaks are however changing because of dilution and traveling time in the groundwater the gd signal is mixed with uncontaminated waters from infiltrated precipitation in the spring catchment leading to a contribution of swallowed surface water of around 5 6 in winter and 20 in summer beside the mixing ratio calculation and detailed information about the interaction the gd mass flow enables flow velocity calculations if the peaks in surface water and groundwater are corresponding a further result is that the signal is attenuated in the aquifer leading to a lower amplitude and more regular appearance of gd peaks in the groundwater seven days but a third or less of the surface water peak finally the comparison with acesulfame k showed that gd has the same source as many other anthropogenic pollutants but is a better environmental tracer for municipal sewage in water than other anthropogenic pollutants compared in this study except acesulfame k mri contrast agents have a high environmental stability at least compared to the analyzed anthropogenic substances the gd signal behaves more conservative compared to other anthropogenic substances and is measurable even after their decay to sum up the measurement of gd proves to be a powerful tool for the investigation of surface water groundwater interaction for anthropogenic influence from municipal waste water on waters and can be analyzed in a cost effective and fast if high performance icp ms instruments are used acknowledgements many thanks to mr thomas walter of the environmental protection
