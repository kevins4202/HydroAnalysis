4630,excess production of nitrogen n and phosphorus p by human activities poses a severe threat to water quality therefore quantitative evaluations of regional nutrient inputs and contributions from the main driving factors are necessary this study aims to identify the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the net anthropogenic n and p inputs nani and napi in china s yangtze river economic belt and explore the environmental effects influencing factors and diversity management through the nani and napi model and statistical models the results reveal that 1 nani and napi first increase and then decrease during 2000 2017 with average values of 7 292 kg n km 2 yr 1 and 2 306 kg p km 2 yr 1 respectively 2 the spatial variation of nani and napi exhibits a decreasing trend from east to west and north to south which is strongly related to the distribution of urban agglomerations and land use patterns 3 the higher net anthropogenic inputs of n and p are associated with the higher n and p concentrations in rivers and lakes which show the spatial pattern of a banded distribution and local concentration and 4 changes in economic factors contribute the most to the changes in nani and napi with average contributions of 74 1 and 74 3 respectively followed by land use factors with average values of 19 5 and 19 3 respectively social factors are less impactful to changes in nani and napi 6 4 for each based on results a nutrient diversity management mechanism was constructed which provides a scientific reference for regional environmental protection and policy formulation keywords nani napi spatiotemporal heterogeneity environmental effect attribution analysis 1 introduction due to rapid industrialization and urbanization environmental pollution has become a matter of significant concern qiang et al 2011 the transfer of excess nitrogen n and phosphorus p from land to aquatic ecosystems has led to a surge and evolution of water eutrophication viaroli et al 2018 yang and lei 2018 the river nutrient flux strongly correlates with the anthropogenic nutrient input where the proportion of nutrient output 20 30 of the n input and 3 6 of the p input reflects the potential risks of nutrient pollution and retention in the basin zhang et al 2020 2019 swaney et al 2012 therefore there is an urgent need to study the mechanism s of anthropogenic nutrient input the n and p loads mostly derive from agricultural activities and food consumption hong et al 2017 on one hand in areas in which agriculture is highly developed fertilizer application may cause excessive nutrient loads in regional water bodies in contrast in areas with high population densities changes in the food import and land use patterns may exacerbate the nutrient load input in addition nutrient input measurement and environmental response processes vary substantially from region to region due to the climate conditions land use and socioeconomic development romero et al 2013 therefore identifying and characterizing the spatiotemporal characteristics of human n and p input and the contributions from driving factors are crucial to regional nutrient differentiation management the yangtze river economic belt covers an area of approximately 2 05 million km2 accounting for 21 of the total area of china both the population and gross domestic product gdp of the yangtze river economic belt account for more than 40 of those for all of china she et al 2019 environmental problems are major threats to green development and the construction of an ecologically sustainable civilization in this region rapid changes in the land use and industrial and agricultural production methods in this area zheng et al 2013 have led to more factories and more urban sewage and fertilizers discharging into the yangtze river deng et al 2015 excessive amounts of organic nutrients livestock excreta and food waste caused by livestock poultry farming and aquaculture have caused a sharp increase in water pollutants resulting in the eutrophication of rivers she et al 2019 the yangtze river is polluted by frequent activities from urban and rural residents hu et al 2020 this is related to the world s largest population largest industrial scale and most complete urban system in this area intense human activity determines the process parameters and impact mechanism of its rainfall runoff characteristics as well as the transportation interception and removal of n and p which significantly differ from those in other regions therefore the management of nutrients in local waterbodies has become one of the most important challenges in the yangtze river economic belt model simulations are important technical foundations for studying the regional n and p inputs and water environment response such that they provide new ideas for the quantitative management of regional nutrients at present mathematical models used to quantify the n and p emissions in the watershed are mainly divided into mechanistic models represented by the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf hunter and walton 2008 and soil and water assessment tool swat grizzetti et al 2003 and statistical models represented by the spatially referenced regressions on watershed sparrow alexander et al 2008 attributes which are commonly used because of their sophisticated spatiotemporal simulation capabilities however their applications are limited in data poor regions because of the high input data requirements therefore one of the important research directions in environmental model development is the use of limited data input to evaluate the regional nutrient input to then obtain an environmental response that meets the accuracy requirements nani howarth et al 1996 and napi russell et al 2008 can be used to evaluate the n and p inputs from human activities based on socioeconomic data nani and napi use a quasi material balance to quantitatively account for the regional n and p inputs nani and napi have been widely used in heterogeneous regions at multiple scales hong et al 2017 howarth et al 2012 wang et al 2016 they have become good indicators of riverine n and p export on a large scale and multi year basis hong et al 2012 however current research is mainly focused on separate studies of the regional nani and napi such that research on their comprehensive and targeted management is rare in addition there is a lack of quantitative calculations of the contributions from the driving factors in this study the yangtze river economic belt was used as the study area to analyze the regional spatiotemporal heterogeneity environmental effects attribution analysis and differentiated management of the nani and napi the nani and napi framework was applied to more recent data from 2000 to 2017 at the provincial level and from 2013 to 2017 at the municipal level based on three objectives 1 identification of the spatiotemporal dynamics in the nani and napi and changes in the proportions of their main components at multiple scales 2 exploration of the environmental responses and contributions from the main factors driving the nani and napi and 3 construction of a diversity management mechanism and method for nani and napi the aim of this study is to provide a scientific basis for regional multiscale refined management and green development through the differential management of nutrients in the yangtze river economic belt 2 material 2 1 study area the yangtze river economic belt covers three chinese regions eastern central and western regions including nine provinces jiangsu zhejiang anhui jiangxi hubei hunan sichuan yunnan and guizhou and two municipalities shanghai and chongqing the 11 provinces and municipalities consist of 126 prefecture level cities three provincial controlled divisions and one tree farm the yangtze river economic belt covers an area of 2 05 million km2 accounting for 21 of the total area of china both the population and gross domestic product gdp in the yangtze river economic belt exceed 40 of the values for the entire country the yangtze river economic belt is one of the largest in the world with the highest population and most industries it is also the most complete urban system in the world lu et al 2020 in addition the differences in longitude latitude and altitude indicate that the natural elements and human activities in the yangtze river economic belt are regionally diverse xu et al 2018 fig 1 shows the study region however owing to the dominance of the manufacturing industry and agriculture high resource utilization is required such that the water environment and ecology are placed under great pressure she et al 2019 for example large scale agricultural production may lead to higher nonpoint source pollution loads the three major national urban agglomerations including the yangtze river delta yangtze river middle reaches and cheng yu urban agglomerations render the yangtze river economic belt a hot spot of domestic pollution 2 2 data sources the data required for this study can be divided into three categories based on the model requirements and research needs socioeconomic data n deposition data and water quality data the data sources used are publicly available in chinese language versions only whose details are shown in fig 2 socioeconomic data can be obtained from the official websites of national provincial and municipal statistics bureaus in china water quality data can be obtained from the website of the china national environmental monitoring centre http www cnemc cn n deposition data jia et al 2018 are available on the website of the national ecosystem research network of china http www cnern org cn 3 methodology 3 1 net anthropogenic nitrogen and phosphorus inputs nani and napi model the nani and napi models were proposed by howarth et al 1996 and russell et al 2008 respectively in principle both employ the quasi mass balance method the principle of the nani and napi model is clear such that calculation and parameter acquisition are easy and convenient respectively therefore this model has become an important tool for evaluating the input of anthropogenic n and p in the region and has been widely used in nutrient assessment studies at home and abroad improvements to the model structure han et al 2013 estimation methods hong et al 2013 and scale conversion han and allan 2008 have diversified the traditional model the selection of calculation methods for different cases depends on the characteristics of the study area and data availability gao et al 2014 in this study nani was calculated as the sum of the atmospheric n deposition ndepo n fertilizer application nefrt agricultural n fixation nagrf and n in food and feed net imports nnffi fig 3 a napi is considered to be composed of p fertilizer application pfert p in food and feed net imports pnffi and non food p due to human activities pnf fig 3b hong et al 2012 the detailed calculation and parameters of each component of the nani and napi were obtained from relevant literature for the same study area nani wang et al 2016 gao et al 2016 napi gao et al 2016 han et al 2013 3 2 grid fractal dimension the grid dimension in fractal theory usually reflects the spatial equilibrium of regional point elements grid dimension d is the most important parameter used to describe fractals and reflect spatial phenomena the fractal grid model was introduced into this study to measure the spatial distribution characteristics of the water quality of monitoring sections that exhibited excess nh3 n and tp and the eutrophic lake since there is a strong correlation between the n and p fluxes in water body and nani napi the environmental effects of nani and napi can be quantitatively verified by the spatial distribution characteristics analysis of point elements by gridding the study area the number of point elements in the area grid can be measured and the multilevel spatial structure of the point elements can be determined mandelbrot 1982 the specific steps are as follows 1 the rectangular area is drawn using four points i e east west south and north of the study area as the tangent points each side of the rectangular area is divided into k 2 k 10 equal parts and the entire rectangular area has k 2 grid cells 2 n x is the number of grid cells containing point elements in which the water quality exceeds the standard if the distribution of the points exceeding the water quality standard in the study area is scale free then we have the following relation 1 n x x d 0 where d 0 is the capacity dimension x is the size of a grid cell x 1 k 3 pij the probability of a point element falling into the i j th grid cell and i x information entropy of the spatial distribution of point elements in all grid cells are calculated where n x k and i x k are plotted onto a double logarithmic scatter graph 2 p ij n ij n where nij is the number of point elements in the grid cell with row number i and column number j and n is the total number of point elements in all grid cells therefore we can obtain the following 3 i x i j k i j k p ij x ln p ij x if the point at which the water quality exceeds the standard in the study area is fractal then 4 i x i 0 d 1 l n x where d 1 is the information dimension and i 0 is a constant 4 the information dimension d 1 and capacity dimension d 0 of the spatial distribution in the water quality monitoring points exceeding the standard and the corresponding equations are obtained by a least squares fit using regression analysis in the study of spatial distribution capacity dimension d 0 and information dimension d 1 are the main practical grid dimensions d when calculating the capacity dimension only the number of grids with point elements is counted the number of points in these grids is not examined however when calculating the information dimension special attention is paid to the probability of the point elements falling into the grids this is realized by counting the number of point elements in the grids liu et al 2018 the grid dimension d represents the equalization degree of point elements distribution in a certain area and the theoretical value ranges from 0 to 2 jonckheere et al 2006 the calculation of capacity dimension d 0 is to obtain the slope of the line after linear regression of lnk and lnn x while the calculation of information dimension d 1 is to obtain the slope of the line after linear regression of lnk and lni x larger d values result in a more balanced spatial distribution of the points otherwise the distribution becomes more concentrated ford and blenkinsop 2008 witte and torfs 2003 when d 2 the points are uniformly distributed and when d approaches 1 the spatial distribution of points has a tendency to be uniformly concentrated on a geographic line by comparing capacity and information dimension the fractal types of point elements simple fractal and complex fractal can be obtained when d 1 d 0 the point system is equally probabilistic in all grid cells and belongs to a simple fractal the relationship between d 0 and d 1 is generally d 1 d 0 indicating that the spatial distribution of point elements is complex 3 3 clustering analysis and diversity management the self organizing map som is an unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering and high dimensional visualization proposed by kohonen 1982 based on the signal processing characteristics of the human brain owing to its unsupervised and probability maintaining characteristics som can automatically classify the input samples according to the learning rules reducing the subjectivity of the indicators and weights and improving the objectivity and accuracy of the classification in contrast to general neural network training based on the reverse transfer of the loss function som uses a competitive learning strategy relying on the competition between neurons to gradually optimize the network som uses the neighbor relationship function to maintain the topological structure of the input space the main advantages of the som are that it can identify multivariate structures and input output relationships and efficiently solve nonlinear regression problems chen et al 2014 som is widely used in the fields of geography and ecology especially for complex data structures large amounts of data and notable nonlinear characteristics the calculation steps include the preliminary step input selection of the winner units declaration of the winner neighborhood adaptation of the weight vectors and stop step li et al 2018 in this study som clustering was used to divide the municipal nani napi into three levels i ii and iii in descending order method details and operation code can be found in the supplementary material subsequently differential clustering was used to divide each level into three categories nani prominent napi prominent and similar levels the ratios of normalized nani and napi were 1 1 and close to 1 respectively furthermore a city classification map was established to provide references for the diversity management of cities the som was implemented using python 3 8 the diversity management in this study aims to identify the diversity of nani vs napi dominance of 130 administrative districts and explore the main driving factors in combination with the attribution analysis the purpose of this is to provide a scientific reference for the designation of management measures diversity management strives to find a balance between the greatest nutrient management effect and smallest economic investment this is particularly important for the cities of the yangtze river economic belt where there is high variability in both physical geography and socio economic conditions consequently it is an important step to accurately identify the different nani napi levels with different categories and the main influencing factors 3 4 attribution analysis based on elasticity coefficient elasticity analysis based on the elasticity coefficient was used to analyze the contributions of various factors that influence the changes in the main behavioral factor index morgan and henrion 1990 in this study the climate elasticity model wang 2014 zheng et al 2009 was utilized to quantify the contributions of factors influencing the changes in nani and napi human activities that may affect the nani and napi mainly include social economic and land use factors hong et al 2012 the human activity factors selected in this study were based on a review of the literature zhang et al 2017 han et al 2011a 2011b and are shown in table 1 the main steps of elasticity coefficient method are as follows 1 a set of influencing factors was assembled based on a literature research and theoretical analysis 2 the maximum information coefficient mic method was used to screen the indicators where the most relevant factors in each category of influencing factors were selected and 3 attribution analysis was performed based on the elasticity coefficient among the various measures available for assessing the correlations among variables e g pearson correlation coefficient spearman correlation or mutual information the mic can be used to measure the correlation of any variable function e g linear nonlinear reshef et al 2011 in this study the following three categories of influencing factors were used social economic and land use factors in order to evaluate the relative contribution rates of these three factors to the change of nani or napi under a unified framework this study suggests that the total change amount of nani or napi is composed of changes in the above three factors the calculation steps of the attribution analysis based on the elasticity coefficient are as follows elasticity coefficient calculation ε x influence calculation δ q x and contribution calculation δ q x in this study the period from 2000 to 2017 was divided into three stages according to the interannual changes in the nani and napi 2000 2005 baseline period and 2006 2011 and 2012 2017 analysis periods the attribution analysis was conducted in terms of each analysis period versus the baseline period 1 elasticity coefficient calculations ε x the nonparametric solution method for the elasticity coefficient eq 5 was used in this study sankarasubramanian et al 2001 zheng et al 2009 the elasticity coefficient ε x including ε s ε e and ε l is expressed as 5 ε x lim δ x x 0 δ q q δ x x q x x q where q is nani or napi and x is the impact factor of nani or napi including social s economic e and land use l factors a positive negative ε x of the x factor indicates that an increase decrease in the x variable will lead to an increase decrease in nani or napi for instance an ε x of 0 1 suggests that a 10 increase in the x factor may result in a 1 increase in nani or napi 2 influence calculation δ q x the influence calculation δ q x including δ q s δ q e and δ q l is performed to calculate the variation of nani and napi that is caused by the change of each influence factor the equation used to determine the effect that each factor has on the change in nani or napi is as follows 6 δ q x ε x δ x x q where q is the multi year average nani or napi for the analysis period 2006 2011 and 2012 2017 respectively x is the corresponding multi year average for the analysis period of the influencing factors ε x is the elasticity coefficient of each factor for the change in nani or napi and δ x is the difference between the average influencing factors for the analysis year and baseline period 3 calculation of the contribution rate δ q x the relative contribution δ q x including δ q s δ q e and δ q l is the percentage of the change caused by each factor in the total change of nani or napi the relative contribution of the social economic and land use factors to the change in nani or napi can be obtained as follows 7 δ q x δ q x δ q s δ q e δ q l 100 where δ q x δ q s δ q e or δ q l is the variation of x social economic or land use factors δ q s δ q e δ q l represents the total quantity value of nani or napi change caused by the change of each influence factor 4 results and discussion 4 1 temporal variations in nani and napi between 2000 and 2017 the nani and napi fluctuated in the yangtze river economic belt the quantities of nani and napi exhibited a three stage pattern over time fig 4 a an uptrend 2000 2005 a fluctuation trend 2006 2011 and a downtrend 2012 2017 the three periods correspond to the three stages of water pollution prevention and control in this region during 2000 2017 the first stage 2000 2005 was a period of rapid emissions growth due to insufficient assessment of pollution emission control measures the treatment effect was limited during this time the proportion of the tertiary industry in gdp increased by 0 47 and the proportion of quality monitoring sections with water quality exceeding grade v at the end of the stage was 11 0 the second stage 2006 2011 was the period of industrial adjustment watershed water pollution prevention and control programs were implemented and industrial restructuring and upgrading were promoted in key watersheds in china during this time the proportion of the tertiary industry in gdp increased by 1 56 and the proportion of quality monitoring sections with water quality exceeding grade v at the end of the stage was 5 3 the third stage 2012 2017 reflects the period of strengthening environmental protections a three level zoning management and control system of basin control area and control unit was established at the same time comprehensive environmental protection work on the yangtze river was performed during this time the proportion of the tertiary industry in gdp increased by 7 67 and the proportion of quality monitoring sections with water quality exceeding grade v at the end of the stage dropped to 2 2 a mann kendall trend test indicated that nani and napi showed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2005 p 0 05 no significant trend from 2006 to 2011 p 0 05 and a decreasing trend from 2012 to 2017 p 0 05 fig 4a other studies related to this region further support these findings huang et al 2017 wang et al 2019 lou et al 2020 the average nani and napi for the period from 2000 to 2017 were 7 292 kg n km 2 yr 1 and 2 306 kg p km 2 yr 1 respectively with standard deviations of 184 959 and 64 093 respectively throughout the 18 year research period the cultivated area in the yangtze river economic belt increased from 3 48 105 km2 to 4 49 105 km2 the quantity of agricultural fertilizer increased from 170 19 105 t to 207 74 105 t the population grew from 5 51 108 to 5 95 108 and the gdp increased from 4 03 106 to 37 40 106 million yuan nani and napi exhibited an increasing trend from 2000 to 2005 however owing to the recent implementation of the systematic environmental protection strategy and technological innovations especially the effective implementation of source control nani and napi have begun to decrease this is also reflected by the increase in environmental pollution control investments from 7 04 104 million yuan in 2004 to 35 82 104 million yuan in 2017 the reduction in the scale of hog farming from 2 56 102 million in 2005 to 2 23 102 million in 2007 owing to supply demand adjustments reduced the n and p in the food and feed net imports therefore troughs can be observed in the temporal evolution of nani and napi in 2007 with values of 7 009 kg n km 2 yr 1 and 2 247 kg p km 2 yr 1 respectively within the corresponding time period the nani in the yangtze river economic belt was relatively similar to the nani in the yangtze river basin 8 177 1 442 kg n km 2 yr 1 but it was higher than the national value 5 013 kg n km 2 yr 1 chen et al 2016 han et al 2014 due to the dense population and intensive agriculture based on the comparison of several typical watersheds in the yangtze river economic belt the nani of the yangtze river economic belt is higher than that of the upper yangtze river basin 4 931 kg n km 2 yr 1 lower than that of the dianchi lake basin 9 900 kg n km 2 yr 1 and similar to that of the poyang lake basin 6 913 kg n km 2 yr 1 wang et al 2016 gao et al 2014 2016 compared with watersheds in the u s a 283 8522 kg n km 2 yr 1 france belgium 2794 12049 kg n km 2 yr 1 the u k 2375 23930 kg n km 2 yr 1 and sweden 161 5918 kg n km 2 yr 1 the nani in the yangtze river economic belt is at the upper middle level howarth et al 2012 the napi in the yangtze river economic belt 2 260 kg p km 2 yr 1 is higher than the national value 465 kg p km 2 yr 1 hu et al 2020 han et al 2013 owing to the socioeconomic characteristics of the region the napi of the yangtze river economic belt is higher than those of the dongting lake basin 1 001 kg p km 2 yr 1 and poyang lake basin 1 078 kg p km 2 yr 1 and lower than that of the huai river basin 2 700 kg p km 2 yr 1 liu et al 2019 gao et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 the napi of the yangtze river economic belt is slightly higher than those of drainage basins in the baltic sea 225 kg p km 2 yr 1 the chesapeake bay region in the united states 486 kg p km 2 yr 1 and the st lawrence sub basin in eastern north america 116 kg p km 2 yr 1 napi in the yangtze river economic belt is slightly higher mccrackin et al 2018 russell et al 2008 goyette et al 2016 in addition each input has a direct effect on the nani and napi from the perspective of the component structure of the nani n fertilizer application is the main component followed by atmospheric n deposition and n in food and feed net imports fig 4b the proportions of net n imports and n fertilizer application show a downward trend the proportion of atmospheric n deposition shows an upward trend which may be due to urbanization and economic growth zhu et al 2020 however the decrease in the amount of applied n fertilizer also causes a downward trend in the nani which began in 2007 the trend in the napi is similar but the proportion of each component is relatively stable fig 4c the large proportion of fertilizer application in the n and p input indicates that agricultural production activities in the yangtze river economic zone significantly affect the anthropogenic n and p input which is similar to the overall nani and napi structures at the national scale han et al 2014 2013 therefore the control strategy for the n and p load must focus on the efficient application of chemical fertilizers 4 2 spatial variations in nani and napi the spatial heterogeneity in the nani and napi varies in different regions of the yangtze river economic belt due to the speed of economic and social development to analyze the multi scale spatial differentiation characteristics of the nani and napi the average values from 2013 to 2017 were selected for the calculation during this period the relevant data of prefecture level cities are complete and unified from the perspective of the strength of the nani and napi in different regions both provincial and city regions exhibit a significant spatial differentiation the provincial level was characterized by a decreasing trend from east to west the nani and napi in the 11 provinces and municipalities varied from 4 962 to 16 576 kg n km 2 yr 1 and 1 133 to 4 879 kg p km 2 yr 1 respectively shanghai jiangsu province located in the east and hubei province located centrally were characterized by high anthropogenic n and p inputs fig 5 a and b which showed provincial nani napi and their component spatial pattern the distribution pattern of the main component n fertilizer was similar to that of the nani and napi besides the nani and napi values in shanghai significantly changed whereas the changes in zhejiang and jiangxi were smaller than those in other central and eastern cities in addition the distribution was high in the north and low in the south owing to the differences in landforms between the areas north and south of the yangtze river environmental quality was better in areas south of the yangtze river where the woodlands and grasslands are less disturbed by humans to the north of the yangtze river where the slope is gentle and farmland and construction land are densely distributed the human disturbance was strong such that the pressure on the ecological environment was greater than that in the south of the study area at the municipal level the spatial patterns in the nani napi and their component essentially follow the provincial patterns fig 5c and d cities with high nani and napi are mostly concentrated in and around the urban agglomerations of the yangtze river delta middle reaches of the yangtze and chengdu chongqing the geographical locations of the urban agglomerations in central guizhou and central yunnan also match the distribution patterns of high nutrient input areas urban agglomerations with larger populations and economic activities exert increasing pressure on the ecological environment hot spot analysis can be used to determine the spatial distributions of high nani and napi input areas fig 5e and f in addition several cities in eastern zhejiang central jiangxi western sichuan yunnan and guizhou provinces have low nani and napi 4 3 environmental effect of nani napi as the n and p fluxes are highly sensitive to the nani and napi in the watershed small changes in the nani and napi may cause significant changes in the n and p contents of rivers and nutritional status of lakes mcisaac et al 2001 gao et al 2014 russell et al 2008 therefore the nani and napi are often used as indices for the n and p pollution potential based on the analysis of the spatial patterns of the nani and napi average values from 2013 to 2017 the water quality grades of nh3 n and tp both are often used as river water quality indicators in major water quality monitoring sections and the nutrition status of major lakes in 2016 were introduced for spatial pattern matching water quality monitoring sections with a water quality exceeding grade iii standards 0 5 mg l cnh3 n 1 0 mg l 0 1 mg l ctp 0 2 mg l including grade iv 1 0 mg l cnh3 n 1 5 mg l 0 2 mg l ctp 0 3 mg l v 1 5 mg l cnh3 n 2 0 mg l 0 3 mg l ctp 0 4 mg l and worse than grade v cnh3 n 2 0 mg l ctp 0 4 mg l as well as light and middle eutrophic lakes were selected for this study fig 6 the vast majority of the net n and p inputs due to human activities are stored in the soil or imported into rivers on one hand parts of the n and p inputs into a river will directly cause surface water pollution in contrast the portions stored in the soil enter the surface water as nonpoint source pollution when exposed to the driving force of rainfall together they will cause environmental problems such as an excess of nutrients in river water zhang et al 2017 2015 there is a very significant linear relationship between the net n and p inputs due to human activities and the outputs of n and p in rivers greater net inputs of n and p due to human activities yield greater outputs of n and p in rivers wang et al 2020 howarth et al 2012 hong et al 2012 this can be verified by the spatial density of the water quality monitoring sections with a water quality exceeding grade iii standards with respect to nh3 n and tp fig 6a and b the spatial density distribution fig 6d and e shows that these sections are mainly concentrated in the vicinity of major urban agglomerations such as the yangtze river delta as well as areas with high agricultural development such as the sichuan basin in the upper reaches and the lake plains in the lower reaches this is highly consistent with the spatial distributions of the nani and napi with the rapid migration of the rural urban population the consumption of high calorie and high protein foods due to changes in people s eating habits has increased the input of n and p gao et al 2015 liu et al 2014 in addition due to the influence of atmospheric deposition litter and other urban sources accumulations of n and p on impervious underlying surfaces are more likely to enter the river by rainfall runoff scouring compared with other land cover types wu and chen 2013 zhang et al 2017 in lake basins lakes are the main collection areas for runoff and pollutants in the yangtze river economic belt eutrophic lakes are mainly distributed in the yunnan guizhou plateau yangtze river delta and yangtze huaihe region which matches the spatial pattern of high n and p input areas fig 6c compared with lightly eutrophic lakes mainly caused by human activities in the eastern and central parts yilong lake xingyun lake qilu lake and dianchi lake in the yunnan guizhou plateau in the west were all moderately eutrophic in 2016 this is also reflected by the spatial density of these lakes lakes in yunnan have always been subjected to considerable human influence and the catchment areas of eutrophic lakes are similar they are characterized by dense land use low vegetation coverage advanced agricultural production developed industry and dense population distribution li et al 2007 the contributions from the landform land use and social economy to eutrophic lakes reach 74 3 liu et al 2012 the unique light ph water depth and closedness of plateau lakes aggravate the degree of nutrition based on the combination of these results with the analysis of the fractal grid dimension the water quality monitoring sections with excess nh3 n and tp and the distribution of eutrophic lakes have a wide scale free interval the coefficient of determination ranges from 0 92 to 0 98 with significant spatial structure fractal characteristics the capacity dimension d 0 ranges from 0 90 to 1 00 fig 6g which is close to 1 indicating that these points are highly concentrated on a geographic line further analysis showed that the points at which ammonia n and p exceed the standard are mainly spread along the yangtze river from the yangtze river delta to the sichuan basin as well as in the direction of the yunnan guizhou plateau eutrophic lakes are mainly distributed in the lake areas of the yunnan guizhou plateau and lower plain the information dimension d 1 ranges from 0 48 to 0 74 fig 6h there is a large gap between the corresponding capacity dimension values the information dimension is smaller than the capacity dimension this indicates that the spatial distribution probability of these points is not equal the spatial structure is complex and a fractal phenomenon of local clustering appears around the center major urban agglomerations during self organization evolution 4 4 contribution of influencing factors to reduce the environmental pressure due to the regional nani and napi we must perform an attribution analysis the results in fig 7 show that the nani and napi are closely related to the permanent population density s1 mic values of 0 94 and 0 86 respectively in terms of the social factors and cultivated land area proportion l1 mic values are 0 88 and 0 85 respectively in terms of the land use factors however the correlation with the three economic factors is medium and relatively close the correlation between the secondary industry output value per unit area e2 and the nani and napi is slightly stronger in addition except for the proportion of the forest area l3 which is negatively correlated with the nani and napi the other proportions show positive correlations the population density is one of the main factors affecting the nani and napi with the increase in the population density there is an increase in the n and p inputs therefore the population density has become the best single predictor han et al 2011a 2011b the land use pattern also has a significant impact on the regional n and p inputs in areas dominated by cultivated land the nani and napi are significantly higher than in areas dominated by forest whereas the nani and napi are the highest in areas with a mixture of agriculture and residential areas han and allan 2008 with respect to economic factors when using the pearson correlation which is the most commonly used analysis method the output value of the primary industry per unit area shows the strongest correlation with the nani and napi which is consistent with the results of other studies however when using the mic for analysis the output value of the secondary industry yields the strongest correlation with the nani and napi the population density may be closely related to industrial development which in turn affects the correlation to further explore the changes in the contributions of the factors influencing the net anthropogenic n and p inputs the permanent population density s1 and cultivated land area proportion l1 were selected to represent the social and land use factors respectively drawing on the concept of feature vectors in machine learning as the results of the mic analysis are more statistically significant the unit area secondary industry output value e2 was used as an economic factor in this study 2000 2005 was used as the baseline period and 2006 2011 and 2012 2017 were used as analysis periods the division of these three stages is mainly based on the time evolutions of the nani and napi uptrend fluctuation trend and downtrend based on elasticity analysis elasticity coefficient and influence calculation results of influencing factors leading to changes of nani and napi in different analysis periods were shown in table s1 supplementary material 2 all values of the δ q x were non negative in this study the calculation results of the contribution rates were shown in fig 8 while the inner ring represents the contribution rate of each influencing factor from 2006 to 2011 and the outer ring reflects the contribution rate of each influencing factor from 2012 to 2017 overall changes in the economic factors contribute the most to the changes in nani and napi with an average of 74 1 and 74 3 respectively followed by the land use factor with an average of 19 5 and 19 3 respectively social factors contribute the least with an average of 6 4 and 6 4 respectively compared with 2006 2011 the changes in the nani and napi from 2012 to 2017 were driven by changes in the social factors in jiangsu and hunan provinces in zhejiang jiangxi hubei and yunnan provinces the changes were driven by changes in the economic factors in addition in shanghai anhui chongqing sichuan and guizhou provinces the changes were driven by changes in the land use factors as many parameters can be used to calculate the nani and napi and their components will also affect each other the contributions from the factors influencing the changes in nani and napi must be analyzed in conjunction with the population economy land use and environmental governance of various regions subsequently the corresponding reduction measures can be formulated 4 5 diversity management of nani napi data elements with small spatial scales help to more accurately identify the main emission sources in this study city level data were used to more effectively identify key n and p input areas during the analysis of provincial level data from the perspective of the spatial distribution fig 9 a and b the 16 level i areas are mainly distributed in the plain area characterized by intensive agricultural development in the northern part of the yangtze river economic belt the 37 level ii areas are mainly distributed in several major urban agglomeration areas the 77 level iii areas are mostly forest land and grassland the distribution of the three levels of areas is consistent with the spatial distribution patterns of the nani and napi the environmental conditions at each level also show notable similarities at each level most of the cities 90 belong to the nani prominent category followed by 36 cities in the similar level category and four cities belonging to the napi prominent category the n and p inputs in a certain area are closely related to factors such as social and economic development hydrometeorology and geographical characteristics kovacs et al 2012 this is the result of the combined effect of pollution source generation factors and the migration and transformation factors in the region the long term effectiveness of nutrient management depends on the ability to accurately locate and systematically manage key areas with different characteristics therefore results will be more effective if limited human and financial resources are provided for the key areas of the nani napi rao et al 2009 for regions with different levels there are variations in the investment in management and control for different categories nani prominent napi prominent and similar level we must combine attribution analysis and targeted measures based on china s action plan for the prevention and control of water pollution the state council p r c 2015 and environmental protection requirements the most basic strategy is to combine the components of the regional nutrient input for management and control fig 10 identify the component with the largest input and combine the results with attribution analysis to formulate detailed engineering and non engineering measures the results show that agricultural chemical fertilizers are the largest source of nani and napi accounting for more than 60 rather robust relationships between the n and p fertilizer quantities and crop production indicate that crop production correlates with the application of 66 44 of n fertilizer and 46 82 of p fertilizer in the yangtze river economic belt fig 11 with respect to the nani prominent category it is necessary to avoid the application of an unreasonable amount of n fertilizer considering the efficiency of the n fertilizer the strict implementation of n emissions standards for industries transportation and agriculture can be used to effectively manage atmospheric n emissions chen et al 2016 with respect to the napi prominent category first the input of chemical p fertilizer should be reduced and the utilization of p should be improved second the problem of p pollution due to organic waste domestic and livestock should be solved in addition attention should be paid to the reutilization of p that remains in the soil and p accumulated in the bottom mud of dams finally the construction of urban and industrial wastewater treatment facilities should be strengthened chen et al 2018 macintosh et al 2018 5 conclusions the nani and napi are effective tools for the assessment of regional anthropogenic n and p pollution and the prediction of the river n and p loads in this study the spatiotemporal heterogeneities of the nani and napi in china s yangtze river economic belt were determined and the environmental effects influencing factors and diversity management were analyzed from 2000 to 2017 the temporal variations in the nani and napi first showed an increasing trend and then a decreasing trend with average nani and napi values of 7 292 kg n km 2 yr 1 and 2 306 kg p km 2 yr 1 respectively the spatial variations in the nani and napi at the provincial level are characterized by a decreasing trend from the east to the west as well as from the north to the south at the municipal level the cities with high nani and napi values are mostly concentrated in and around the urban agglomerations of the yangtze river delta middle reaches of the yangtze river and chengdu chongqing the results regarding the environmental effects show that higher net inputs of n and p due to human activities result in greater outputs of n and p in rivers and lakes which revealed the spatial pattern of the banded distribution and local concentration attribution analysis shows that changes in the economic factors contribute the most to the changes in the nani and napi with an average of 74 1 and 74 3 respectively followed by the land use factor with an average of 19 5 and 19 3 respectively the average social factors contribute the least to the changes in the nani and napi with 6 4 and 6 4 respectively differentiated management of each category helps to efficiently manage nutrients future improvement to the efficiencies of fertilizer and sewage treatments during agricultural production has a high potential to reduce the point and nonpoint source pollution loads while paying attention to the nutrient load in the waterbody it is essential to also focus on the nutrient load in the soil to further improve n and p input management systems credit authorship contribution statement chenning deng writing original draft writing review editing lusan liu

4630,excess production of nitrogen n and phosphorus p by human activities poses a severe threat to water quality therefore quantitative evaluations of regional nutrient inputs and contributions from the main driving factors are necessary this study aims to identify the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the net anthropogenic n and p inputs nani and napi in china s yangtze river economic belt and explore the environmental effects influencing factors and diversity management through the nani and napi model and statistical models the results reveal that 1 nani and napi first increase and then decrease during 2000 2017 with average values of 7 292 kg n km 2 yr 1 and 2 306 kg p km 2 yr 1 respectively 2 the spatial variation of nani and napi exhibits a decreasing trend from east to west and north to south which is strongly related to the distribution of urban agglomerations and land use patterns 3 the higher net anthropogenic inputs of n and p are associated with the higher n and p concentrations in rivers and lakes which show the spatial pattern of a banded distribution and local concentration and 4 changes in economic factors contribute the most to the changes in nani and napi with average contributions of 74 1 and 74 3 respectively followed by land use factors with average values of 19 5 and 19 3 respectively social factors are less impactful to changes in nani and napi 6 4 for each based on results a nutrient diversity management mechanism was constructed which provides a scientific reference for regional environmental protection and policy formulation keywords nani napi spatiotemporal heterogeneity environmental effect attribution analysis 1 introduction due to rapid industrialization and urbanization environmental pollution has become a matter of significant concern qiang et al 2011 the transfer of excess nitrogen n and phosphorus p from land to aquatic ecosystems has led to a surge and evolution of water eutrophication viaroli et al 2018 yang and lei 2018 the river nutrient flux strongly correlates with the anthropogenic nutrient input where the proportion of nutrient output 20 30 of the n input and 3 6 of the p input reflects the potential risks of nutrient pollution and retention in the basin zhang et al 2020 2019 swaney et al 2012 therefore there is an urgent need to study the mechanism s of anthropogenic nutrient input the n and p loads mostly derive from agricultural activities and food consumption hong et al 2017 on one hand in areas in which agriculture is highly developed fertilizer application may cause excessive nutrient loads in regional water bodies in contrast in areas with high population densities changes in the food import and land use patterns may exacerbate the nutrient load input in addition nutrient input measurement and environmental response processes vary substantially from region to region due to the climate conditions land use and socioeconomic development romero et al 2013 therefore identifying and characterizing the spatiotemporal characteristics of human n and p input and the contributions from driving factors are crucial to regional nutrient differentiation management the yangtze river economic belt covers an area of approximately 2 05 million km2 accounting for 21 of the total area of china both the population and gross domestic product gdp of the yangtze river economic belt account for more than 40 of those for all of china she et al 2019 environmental problems are major threats to green development and the construction of an ecologically sustainable civilization in this region rapid changes in the land use and industrial and agricultural production methods in this area zheng et al 2013 have led to more factories and more urban sewage and fertilizers discharging into the yangtze river deng et al 2015 excessive amounts of organic nutrients livestock excreta and food waste caused by livestock poultry farming and aquaculture have caused a sharp increase in water pollutants resulting in the eutrophication of rivers she et al 2019 the yangtze river is polluted by frequent activities from urban and rural residents hu et al 2020 this is related to the world s largest population largest industrial scale and most complete urban system in this area intense human activity determines the process parameters and impact mechanism of its rainfall runoff characteristics as well as the transportation interception and removal of n and p which significantly differ from those in other regions therefore the management of nutrients in local waterbodies has become one of the most important challenges in the yangtze river economic belt model simulations are important technical foundations for studying the regional n and p inputs and water environment response such that they provide new ideas for the quantitative management of regional nutrients at present mathematical models used to quantify the n and p emissions in the watershed are mainly divided into mechanistic models represented by the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf hunter and walton 2008 and soil and water assessment tool swat grizzetti et al 2003 and statistical models represented by the spatially referenced regressions on watershed sparrow alexander et al 2008 attributes which are commonly used because of their sophisticated spatiotemporal simulation capabilities however their applications are limited in data poor regions because of the high input data requirements therefore one of the important research directions in environmental model development is the use of limited data input to evaluate the regional nutrient input to then obtain an environmental response that meets the accuracy requirements nani howarth et al 1996 and napi russell et al 2008 can be used to evaluate the n and p inputs from human activities based on socioeconomic data nani and napi use a quasi material balance to quantitatively account for the regional n and p inputs nani and napi have been widely used in heterogeneous regions at multiple scales hong et al 2017 howarth et al 2012 wang et al 2016 they have become good indicators of riverine n and p export on a large scale and multi year basis hong et al 2012 however current research is mainly focused on separate studies of the regional nani and napi such that research on their comprehensive and targeted management is rare in addition there is a lack of quantitative calculations of the contributions from the driving factors in this study the yangtze river economic belt was used as the study area to analyze the regional spatiotemporal heterogeneity environmental effects attribution analysis and differentiated management of the nani and napi the nani and napi framework was applied to more recent data from 2000 to 2017 at the provincial level and from 2013 to 2017 at the municipal level based on three objectives 1 identification of the spatiotemporal dynamics in the nani and napi and changes in the proportions of their main components at multiple scales 2 exploration of the environmental responses and contributions from the main factors driving the nani and napi and 3 construction of a diversity management mechanism and method for nani and napi the aim of this study is to provide a scientific basis for regional multiscale refined management and green development through the differential management of nutrients in the yangtze river economic belt 2 material 2 1 study area the yangtze river economic belt covers three chinese regions eastern central and western regions including nine provinces jiangsu zhejiang anhui jiangxi hubei hunan sichuan yunnan and guizhou and two municipalities shanghai and chongqing the 11 provinces and municipalities consist of 126 prefecture level cities three provincial controlled divisions and one tree farm the yangtze river economic belt covers an area of 2 05 million km2 accounting for 21 of the total area of china both the population and gross domestic product gdp in the yangtze river economic belt exceed 40 of the values for the entire country the yangtze river economic belt is one of the largest in the world with the highest population and most industries it is also the most complete urban system in the world lu et al 2020 in addition the differences in longitude latitude and altitude indicate that the natural elements and human activities in the yangtze river economic belt are regionally diverse xu et al 2018 fig 1 shows the study region however owing to the dominance of the manufacturing industry and agriculture high resource utilization is required such that the water environment and ecology are placed under great pressure she et al 2019 for example large scale agricultural production may lead to higher nonpoint source pollution loads the three major national urban agglomerations including the yangtze river delta yangtze river middle reaches and cheng yu urban agglomerations render the yangtze river economic belt a hot spot of domestic pollution 2 2 data sources the data required for this study can be divided into three categories based on the model requirements and research needs socioeconomic data n deposition data and water quality data the data sources used are publicly available in chinese language versions only whose details are shown in fig 2 socioeconomic data can be obtained from the official websites of national provincial and municipal statistics bureaus in china water quality data can be obtained from the website of the china national environmental monitoring centre http www cnemc cn n deposition data jia et al 2018 are available on the website of the national ecosystem research network of china http www cnern org cn 3 methodology 3 1 net anthropogenic nitrogen and phosphorus inputs nani and napi model the nani and napi models were proposed by howarth et al 1996 and russell et al 2008 respectively in principle both employ the quasi mass balance method the principle of the nani and napi model is clear such that calculation and parameter acquisition are easy and convenient respectively therefore this model has become an important tool for evaluating the input of anthropogenic n and p in the region and has been widely used in nutrient assessment studies at home and abroad improvements to the model structure han et al 2013 estimation methods hong et al 2013 and scale conversion han and allan 2008 have diversified the traditional model the selection of calculation methods for different cases depends on the characteristics of the study area and data availability gao et al 2014 in this study nani was calculated as the sum of the atmospheric n deposition ndepo n fertilizer application nefrt agricultural n fixation nagrf and n in food and feed net imports nnffi fig 3 a napi is considered to be composed of p fertilizer application pfert p in food and feed net imports pnffi and non food p due to human activities pnf fig 3b hong et al 2012 the detailed calculation and parameters of each component of the nani and napi were obtained from relevant literature for the same study area nani wang et al 2016 gao et al 2016 napi gao et al 2016 han et al 2013 3 2 grid fractal dimension the grid dimension in fractal theory usually reflects the spatial equilibrium of regional point elements grid dimension d is the most important parameter used to describe fractals and reflect spatial phenomena the fractal grid model was introduced into this study to measure the spatial distribution characteristics of the water quality of monitoring sections that exhibited excess nh3 n and tp and the eutrophic lake since there is a strong correlation between the n and p fluxes in water body and nani napi the environmental effects of nani and napi can be quantitatively verified by the spatial distribution characteristics analysis of point elements by gridding the study area the number of point elements in the area grid can be measured and the multilevel spatial structure of the point elements can be determined mandelbrot 1982 the specific steps are as follows 1 the rectangular area is drawn using four points i e east west south and north of the study area as the tangent points each side of the rectangular area is divided into k 2 k 10 equal parts and the entire rectangular area has k 2 grid cells 2 n x is the number of grid cells containing point elements in which the water quality exceeds the standard if the distribution of the points exceeding the water quality standard in the study area is scale free then we have the following relation 1 n x x d 0 where d 0 is the capacity dimension x is the size of a grid cell x 1 k 3 pij the probability of a point element falling into the i j th grid cell and i x information entropy of the spatial distribution of point elements in all grid cells are calculated where n x k and i x k are plotted onto a double logarithmic scatter graph 2 p ij n ij n where nij is the number of point elements in the grid cell with row number i and column number j and n is the total number of point elements in all grid cells therefore we can obtain the following 3 i x i j k i j k p ij x ln p ij x if the point at which the water quality exceeds the standard in the study area is fractal then 4 i x i 0 d 1 l n x where d 1 is the information dimension and i 0 is a constant 4 the information dimension d 1 and capacity dimension d 0 of the spatial distribution in the water quality monitoring points exceeding the standard and the corresponding equations are obtained by a least squares fit using regression analysis in the study of spatial distribution capacity dimension d 0 and information dimension d 1 are the main practical grid dimensions d when calculating the capacity dimension only the number of grids with point elements is counted the number of points in these grids is not examined however when calculating the information dimension special attention is paid to the probability of the point elements falling into the grids this is realized by counting the number of point elements in the grids liu et al 2018 the grid dimension d represents the equalization degree of point elements distribution in a certain area and the theoretical value ranges from 0 to 2 jonckheere et al 2006 the calculation of capacity dimension d 0 is to obtain the slope of the line after linear regression of lnk and lnn x while the calculation of information dimension d 1 is to obtain the slope of the line after linear regression of lnk and lni x larger d values result in a more balanced spatial distribution of the points otherwise the distribution becomes more concentrated ford and blenkinsop 2008 witte and torfs 2003 when d 2 the points are uniformly distributed and when d approaches 1 the spatial distribution of points has a tendency to be uniformly concentrated on a geographic line by comparing capacity and information dimension the fractal types of point elements simple fractal and complex fractal can be obtained when d 1 d 0 the point system is equally probabilistic in all grid cells and belongs to a simple fractal the relationship between d 0 and d 1 is generally d 1 d 0 indicating that the spatial distribution of point elements is complex 3 3 clustering analysis and diversity management the self organizing map som is an unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering and high dimensional visualization proposed by kohonen 1982 based on the signal processing characteristics of the human brain owing to its unsupervised and probability maintaining characteristics som can automatically classify the input samples according to the learning rules reducing the subjectivity of the indicators and weights and improving the objectivity and accuracy of the classification in contrast to general neural network training based on the reverse transfer of the loss function som uses a competitive learning strategy relying on the competition between neurons to gradually optimize the network som uses the neighbor relationship function to maintain the topological structure of the input space the main advantages of the som are that it can identify multivariate structures and input output relationships and efficiently solve nonlinear regression problems chen et al 2014 som is widely used in the fields of geography and ecology especially for complex data structures large amounts of data and notable nonlinear characteristics the calculation steps include the preliminary step input selection of the winner units declaration of the winner neighborhood adaptation of the weight vectors and stop step li et al 2018 in this study som clustering was used to divide the municipal nani napi into three levels i ii and iii in descending order method details and operation code can be found in the supplementary material subsequently differential clustering was used to divide each level into three categories nani prominent napi prominent and similar levels the ratios of normalized nani and napi were 1 1 and close to 1 respectively furthermore a city classification map was established to provide references for the diversity management of cities the som was implemented using python 3 8 the diversity management in this study aims to identify the diversity of nani vs napi dominance of 130 administrative districts and explore the main driving factors in combination with the attribution analysis the purpose of this is to provide a scientific reference for the designation of management measures diversity management strives to find a balance between the greatest nutrient management effect and smallest economic investment this is particularly important for the cities of the yangtze river economic belt where there is high variability in both physical geography and socio economic conditions consequently it is an important step to accurately identify the different nani napi levels with different categories and the main influencing factors 3 4 attribution analysis based on elasticity coefficient elasticity analysis based on the elasticity coefficient was used to analyze the contributions of various factors that influence the changes in the main behavioral factor index morgan and henrion 1990 in this study the climate elasticity model wang 2014 zheng et al 2009 was utilized to quantify the contributions of factors influencing the changes in nani and napi human activities that may affect the nani and napi mainly include social economic and land use factors hong et al 2012 the human activity factors selected in this study were based on a review of the literature zhang et al 2017 han et al 2011a 2011b and are shown in table 1 the main steps of elasticity coefficient method are as follows 1 a set of influencing factors was assembled based on a literature research and theoretical analysis 2 the maximum information coefficient mic method was used to screen the indicators where the most relevant factors in each category of influencing factors were selected and 3 attribution analysis was performed based on the elasticity coefficient among the various measures available for assessing the correlations among variables e g pearson correlation coefficient spearman correlation or mutual information the mic can be used to measure the correlation of any variable function e g linear nonlinear reshef et al 2011 in this study the following three categories of influencing factors were used social economic and land use factors in order to evaluate the relative contribution rates of these three factors to the change of nani or napi under a unified framework this study suggests that the total change amount of nani or napi is composed of changes in the above three factors the calculation steps of the attribution analysis based on the elasticity coefficient are as follows elasticity coefficient calculation ε x influence calculation δ q x and contribution calculation δ q x in this study the period from 2000 to 2017 was divided into three stages according to the interannual changes in the nani and napi 2000 2005 baseline period and 2006 2011 and 2012 2017 analysis periods the attribution analysis was conducted in terms of each analysis period versus the baseline period 1 elasticity coefficient calculations ε x the nonparametric solution method for the elasticity coefficient eq 5 was used in this study sankarasubramanian et al 2001 zheng et al 2009 the elasticity coefficient ε x including ε s ε e and ε l is expressed as 5 ε x lim δ x x 0 δ q q δ x x q x x q where q is nani or napi and x is the impact factor of nani or napi including social s economic e and land use l factors a positive negative ε x of the x factor indicates that an increase decrease in the x variable will lead to an increase decrease in nani or napi for instance an ε x of 0 1 suggests that a 10 increase in the x factor may result in a 1 increase in nani or napi 2 influence calculation δ q x the influence calculation δ q x including δ q s δ q e and δ q l is performed to calculate the variation of nani and napi that is caused by the change of each influence factor the equation used to determine the effect that each factor has on the change in nani or napi is as follows 6 δ q x ε x δ x x q where q is the multi year average nani or napi for the analysis period 2006 2011 and 2012 2017 respectively x is the corresponding multi year average for the analysis period of the influencing factors ε x is the elasticity coefficient of each factor for the change in nani or napi and δ x is the difference between the average influencing factors for the analysis year and baseline period 3 calculation of the contribution rate δ q x the relative contribution δ q x including δ q s δ q e and δ q l is the percentage of the change caused by each factor in the total change of nani or napi the relative contribution of the social economic and land use factors to the change in nani or napi can be obtained as follows 7 δ q x δ q x δ q s δ q e δ q l 100 where δ q x δ q s δ q e or δ q l is the variation of x social economic or land use factors δ q s δ q e δ q l represents the total quantity value of nani or napi change caused by the change of each influence factor 4 results and discussion 4 1 temporal variations in nani and napi between 2000 and 2017 the nani and napi fluctuated in the yangtze river economic belt the quantities of nani and napi exhibited a three stage pattern over time fig 4 a an uptrend 2000 2005 a fluctuation trend 2006 2011 and a downtrend 2012 2017 the three periods correspond to the three stages of water pollution prevention and control in this region during 2000 2017 the first stage 2000 2005 was a period of rapid emissions growth due to insufficient assessment of pollution emission control measures the treatment effect was limited during this time the proportion of the tertiary industry in gdp increased by 0 47 and the proportion of quality monitoring sections with water quality exceeding grade v at the end of the stage was 11 0 the second stage 2006 2011 was the period of industrial adjustment watershed water pollution prevention and control programs were implemented and industrial restructuring and upgrading were promoted in key watersheds in china during this time the proportion of the tertiary industry in gdp increased by 1 56 and the proportion of quality monitoring sections with water quality exceeding grade v at the end of the stage was 5 3 the third stage 2012 2017 reflects the period of strengthening environmental protections a three level zoning management and control system of basin control area and control unit was established at the same time comprehensive environmental protection work on the yangtze river was performed during this time the proportion of the tertiary industry in gdp increased by 7 67 and the proportion of quality monitoring sections with water quality exceeding grade v at the end of the stage dropped to 2 2 a mann kendall trend test indicated that nani and napi showed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2005 p 0 05 no significant trend from 2006 to 2011 p 0 05 and a decreasing trend from 2012 to 2017 p 0 05 fig 4a other studies related to this region further support these findings huang et al 2017 wang et al 2019 lou et al 2020 the average nani and napi for the period from 2000 to 2017 were 7 292 kg n km 2 yr 1 and 2 306 kg p km 2 yr 1 respectively with standard deviations of 184 959 and 64 093 respectively throughout the 18 year research period the cultivated area in the yangtze river economic belt increased from 3 48 105 km2 to 4 49 105 km2 the quantity of agricultural fertilizer increased from 170 19 105 t to 207 74 105 t the population grew from 5 51 108 to 5 95 108 and the gdp increased from 4 03 106 to 37 40 106 million yuan nani and napi exhibited an increasing trend from 2000 to 2005 however owing to the recent implementation of the systematic environmental protection strategy and technological innovations especially the effective implementation of source control nani and napi have begun to decrease this is also reflected by the increase in environmental pollution control investments from 7 04 104 million yuan in 2004 to 35 82 104 million yuan in 2017 the reduction in the scale of hog farming from 2 56 102 million in 2005 to 2 23 102 million in 2007 owing to supply demand adjustments reduced the n and p in the food and feed net imports therefore troughs can be observed in the temporal evolution of nani and napi in 2007 with values of 7 009 kg n km 2 yr 1 and 2 247 kg p km 2 yr 1 respectively within the corresponding time period the nani in the yangtze river economic belt was relatively similar to the nani in the yangtze river basin 8 177 1 442 kg n km 2 yr 1 but it was higher than the national value 5 013 kg n km 2 yr 1 chen et al 2016 han et al 2014 due to the dense population and intensive agriculture based on the comparison of several typical watersheds in the yangtze river economic belt the nani of the yangtze river economic belt is higher than that of the upper yangtze river basin 4 931 kg n km 2 yr 1 lower than that of the dianchi lake basin 9 900 kg n km 2 yr 1 and similar to that of the poyang lake basin 6 913 kg n km 2 yr 1 wang et al 2016 gao et al 2014 2016 compared with watersheds in the u s a 283 8522 kg n km 2 yr 1 france belgium 2794 12049 kg n km 2 yr 1 the u k 2375 23930 kg n km 2 yr 1 and sweden 161 5918 kg n km 2 yr 1 the nani in the yangtze river economic belt is at the upper middle level howarth et al 2012 the napi in the yangtze river economic belt 2 260 kg p km 2 yr 1 is higher than the national value 465 kg p km 2 yr 1 hu et al 2020 han et al 2013 owing to the socioeconomic characteristics of the region the napi of the yangtze river economic belt is higher than those of the dongting lake basin 1 001 kg p km 2 yr 1 and poyang lake basin 1 078 kg p km 2 yr 1 and lower than that of the huai river basin 2 700 kg p km 2 yr 1 liu et al 2019 gao et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 the napi of the yangtze river economic belt is slightly higher than those of drainage basins in the baltic sea 225 kg p km 2 yr 1 the chesapeake bay region in the united states 486 kg p km 2 yr 1 and the st lawrence sub basin in eastern north america 116 kg p km 2 yr 1 napi in the yangtze river economic belt is slightly higher mccrackin et al 2018 russell et al 2008 goyette et al 2016 in addition each input has a direct effect on the nani and napi from the perspective of the component structure of the nani n fertilizer application is the main component followed by atmospheric n deposition and n in food and feed net imports fig 4b the proportions of net n imports and n fertilizer application show a downward trend the proportion of atmospheric n deposition shows an upward trend which may be due to urbanization and economic growth zhu et al 2020 however the decrease in the amount of applied n fertilizer also causes a downward trend in the nani which began in 2007 the trend in the napi is similar but the proportion of each component is relatively stable fig 4c the large proportion of fertilizer application in the n and p input indicates that agricultural production activities in the yangtze river economic zone significantly affect the anthropogenic n and p input which is similar to the overall nani and napi structures at the national scale han et al 2014 2013 therefore the control strategy for the n and p load must focus on the efficient application of chemical fertilizers 4 2 spatial variations in nani and napi the spatial heterogeneity in the nani and napi varies in different regions of the yangtze river economic belt due to the speed of economic and social development to analyze the multi scale spatial differentiation characteristics of the nani and napi the average values from 2013 to 2017 were selected for the calculation during this period the relevant data of prefecture level cities are complete and unified from the perspective of the strength of the nani and napi in different regions both provincial and city regions exhibit a significant spatial differentiation the provincial level was characterized by a decreasing trend from east to west the nani and napi in the 11 provinces and municipalities varied from 4 962 to 16 576 kg n km 2 yr 1 and 1 133 to 4 879 kg p km 2 yr 1 respectively shanghai jiangsu province located in the east and hubei province located centrally were characterized by high anthropogenic n and p inputs fig 5 a and b which showed provincial nani napi and their component spatial pattern the distribution pattern of the main component n fertilizer was similar to that of the nani and napi besides the nani and napi values in shanghai significantly changed whereas the changes in zhejiang and jiangxi were smaller than those in other central and eastern cities in addition the distribution was high in the north and low in the south owing to the differences in landforms between the areas north and south of the yangtze river environmental quality was better in areas south of the yangtze river where the woodlands and grasslands are less disturbed by humans to the north of the yangtze river where the slope is gentle and farmland and construction land are densely distributed the human disturbance was strong such that the pressure on the ecological environment was greater than that in the south of the study area at the municipal level the spatial patterns in the nani napi and their component essentially follow the provincial patterns fig 5c and d cities with high nani and napi are mostly concentrated in and around the urban agglomerations of the yangtze river delta middle reaches of the yangtze and chengdu chongqing the geographical locations of the urban agglomerations in central guizhou and central yunnan also match the distribution patterns of high nutrient input areas urban agglomerations with larger populations and economic activities exert increasing pressure on the ecological environment hot spot analysis can be used to determine the spatial distributions of high nani and napi input areas fig 5e and f in addition several cities in eastern zhejiang central jiangxi western sichuan yunnan and guizhou provinces have low nani and napi 4 3 environmental effect of nani napi as the n and p fluxes are highly sensitive to the nani and napi in the watershed small changes in the nani and napi may cause significant changes in the n and p contents of rivers and nutritional status of lakes mcisaac et al 2001 gao et al 2014 russell et al 2008 therefore the nani and napi are often used as indices for the n and p pollution potential based on the analysis of the spatial patterns of the nani and napi average values from 2013 to 2017 the water quality grades of nh3 n and tp both are often used as river water quality indicators in major water quality monitoring sections and the nutrition status of major lakes in 2016 were introduced for spatial pattern matching water quality monitoring sections with a water quality exceeding grade iii standards 0 5 mg l cnh3 n 1 0 mg l 0 1 mg l ctp 0 2 mg l including grade iv 1 0 mg l cnh3 n 1 5 mg l 0 2 mg l ctp 0 3 mg l v 1 5 mg l cnh3 n 2 0 mg l 0 3 mg l ctp 0 4 mg l and worse than grade v cnh3 n 2 0 mg l ctp 0 4 mg l as well as light and middle eutrophic lakes were selected for this study fig 6 the vast majority of the net n and p inputs due to human activities are stored in the soil or imported into rivers on one hand parts of the n and p inputs into a river will directly cause surface water pollution in contrast the portions stored in the soil enter the surface water as nonpoint source pollution when exposed to the driving force of rainfall together they will cause environmental problems such as an excess of nutrients in river water zhang et al 2017 2015 there is a very significant linear relationship between the net n and p inputs due to human activities and the outputs of n and p in rivers greater net inputs of n and p due to human activities yield greater outputs of n and p in rivers wang et al 2020 howarth et al 2012 hong et al 2012 this can be verified by the spatial density of the water quality monitoring sections with a water quality exceeding grade iii standards with respect to nh3 n and tp fig 6a and b the spatial density distribution fig 6d and e shows that these sections are mainly concentrated in the vicinity of major urban agglomerations such as the yangtze river delta as well as areas with high agricultural development such as the sichuan basin in the upper reaches and the lake plains in the lower reaches this is highly consistent with the spatial distributions of the nani and napi with the rapid migration of the rural urban population the consumption of high calorie and high protein foods due to changes in people s eating habits has increased the input of n and p gao et al 2015 liu et al 2014 in addition due to the influence of atmospheric deposition litter and other urban sources accumulations of n and p on impervious underlying surfaces are more likely to enter the river by rainfall runoff scouring compared with other land cover types wu and chen 2013 zhang et al 2017 in lake basins lakes are the main collection areas for runoff and pollutants in the yangtze river economic belt eutrophic lakes are mainly distributed in the yunnan guizhou plateau yangtze river delta and yangtze huaihe region which matches the spatial pattern of high n and p input areas fig 6c compared with lightly eutrophic lakes mainly caused by human activities in the eastern and central parts yilong lake xingyun lake qilu lake and dianchi lake in the yunnan guizhou plateau in the west were all moderately eutrophic in 2016 this is also reflected by the spatial density of these lakes lakes in yunnan have always been subjected to considerable human influence and the catchment areas of eutrophic lakes are similar they are characterized by dense land use low vegetation coverage advanced agricultural production developed industry and dense population distribution li et al 2007 the contributions from the landform land use and social economy to eutrophic lakes reach 74 3 liu et al 2012 the unique light ph water depth and closedness of plateau lakes aggravate the degree of nutrition based on the combination of these results with the analysis of the fractal grid dimension the water quality monitoring sections with excess nh3 n and tp and the distribution of eutrophic lakes have a wide scale free interval the coefficient of determination ranges from 0 92 to 0 98 with significant spatial structure fractal characteristics the capacity dimension d 0 ranges from 0 90 to 1 00 fig 6g which is close to 1 indicating that these points are highly concentrated on a geographic line further analysis showed that the points at which ammonia n and p exceed the standard are mainly spread along the yangtze river from the yangtze river delta to the sichuan basin as well as in the direction of the yunnan guizhou plateau eutrophic lakes are mainly distributed in the lake areas of the yunnan guizhou plateau and lower plain the information dimension d 1 ranges from 0 48 to 0 74 fig 6h there is a large gap between the corresponding capacity dimension values the information dimension is smaller than the capacity dimension this indicates that the spatial distribution probability of these points is not equal the spatial structure is complex and a fractal phenomenon of local clustering appears around the center major urban agglomerations during self organization evolution 4 4 contribution of influencing factors to reduce the environmental pressure due to the regional nani and napi we must perform an attribution analysis the results in fig 7 show that the nani and napi are closely related to the permanent population density s1 mic values of 0 94 and 0 86 respectively in terms of the social factors and cultivated land area proportion l1 mic values are 0 88 and 0 85 respectively in terms of the land use factors however the correlation with the three economic factors is medium and relatively close the correlation between the secondary industry output value per unit area e2 and the nani and napi is slightly stronger in addition except for the proportion of the forest area l3 which is negatively correlated with the nani and napi the other proportions show positive correlations the population density is one of the main factors affecting the nani and napi with the increase in the population density there is an increase in the n and p inputs therefore the population density has become the best single predictor han et al 2011a 2011b the land use pattern also has a significant impact on the regional n and p inputs in areas dominated by cultivated land the nani and napi are significantly higher than in areas dominated by forest whereas the nani and napi are the highest in areas with a mixture of agriculture and residential areas han and allan 2008 with respect to economic factors when using the pearson correlation which is the most commonly used analysis method the output value of the primary industry per unit area shows the strongest correlation with the nani and napi which is consistent with the results of other studies however when using the mic for analysis the output value of the secondary industry yields the strongest correlation with the nani and napi the population density may be closely related to industrial development which in turn affects the correlation to further explore the changes in the contributions of the factors influencing the net anthropogenic n and p inputs the permanent population density s1 and cultivated land area proportion l1 were selected to represent the social and land use factors respectively drawing on the concept of feature vectors in machine learning as the results of the mic analysis are more statistically significant the unit area secondary industry output value e2 was used as an economic factor in this study 2000 2005 was used as the baseline period and 2006 2011 and 2012 2017 were used as analysis periods the division of these three stages is mainly based on the time evolutions of the nani and napi uptrend fluctuation trend and downtrend based on elasticity analysis elasticity coefficient and influence calculation results of influencing factors leading to changes of nani and napi in different analysis periods were shown in table s1 supplementary material 2 all values of the δ q x were non negative in this study the calculation results of the contribution rates were shown in fig 8 while the inner ring represents the contribution rate of each influencing factor from 2006 to 2011 and the outer ring reflects the contribution rate of each influencing factor from 2012 to 2017 overall changes in the economic factors contribute the most to the changes in nani and napi with an average of 74 1 and 74 3 respectively followed by the land use factor with an average of 19 5 and 19 3 respectively social factors contribute the least with an average of 6 4 and 6 4 respectively compared with 2006 2011 the changes in the nani and napi from 2012 to 2017 were driven by changes in the social factors in jiangsu and hunan provinces in zhejiang jiangxi hubei and yunnan provinces the changes were driven by changes in the economic factors in addition in shanghai anhui chongqing sichuan and guizhou provinces the changes were driven by changes in the land use factors as many parameters can be used to calculate the nani and napi and their components will also affect each other the contributions from the factors influencing the changes in nani and napi must be analyzed in conjunction with the population economy land use and environmental governance of various regions subsequently the corresponding reduction measures can be formulated 4 5 diversity management of nani napi data elements with small spatial scales help to more accurately identify the main emission sources in this study city level data were used to more effectively identify key n and p input areas during the analysis of provincial level data from the perspective of the spatial distribution fig 9 a and b the 16 level i areas are mainly distributed in the plain area characterized by intensive agricultural development in the northern part of the yangtze river economic belt the 37 level ii areas are mainly distributed in several major urban agglomeration areas the 77 level iii areas are mostly forest land and grassland the distribution of the three levels of areas is consistent with the spatial distribution patterns of the nani and napi the environmental conditions at each level also show notable similarities at each level most of the cities 90 belong to the nani prominent category followed by 36 cities in the similar level category and four cities belonging to the napi prominent category the n and p inputs in a certain area are closely related to factors such as social and economic development hydrometeorology and geographical characteristics kovacs et al 2012 this is the result of the combined effect of pollution source generation factors and the migration and transformation factors in the region the long term effectiveness of nutrient management depends on the ability to accurately locate and systematically manage key areas with different characteristics therefore results will be more effective if limited human and financial resources are provided for the key areas of the nani napi rao et al 2009 for regions with different levels there are variations in the investment in management and control for different categories nani prominent napi prominent and similar level we must combine attribution analysis and targeted measures based on china s action plan for the prevention and control of water pollution the state council p r c 2015 and environmental protection requirements the most basic strategy is to combine the components of the regional nutrient input for management and control fig 10 identify the component with the largest input and combine the results with attribution analysis to formulate detailed engineering and non engineering measures the results show that agricultural chemical fertilizers are the largest source of nani and napi accounting for more than 60 rather robust relationships between the n and p fertilizer quantities and crop production indicate that crop production correlates with the application of 66 44 of n fertilizer and 46 82 of p fertilizer in the yangtze river economic belt fig 11 with respect to the nani prominent category it is necessary to avoid the application of an unreasonable amount of n fertilizer considering the efficiency of the n fertilizer the strict implementation of n emissions standards for industries transportation and agriculture can be used to effectively manage atmospheric n emissions chen et al 2016 with respect to the napi prominent category first the input of chemical p fertilizer should be reduced and the utilization of p should be improved second the problem of p pollution due to organic waste domestic and livestock should be solved in addition attention should be paid to the reutilization of p that remains in the soil and p accumulated in the bottom mud of dams finally the construction of urban and industrial wastewater treatment facilities should be strengthened chen et al 2018 macintosh et al 2018 5 conclusions the nani and napi are effective tools for the assessment of regional anthropogenic n and p pollution and the prediction of the river n and p loads in this study the spatiotemporal heterogeneities of the nani and napi in china s yangtze river economic belt were determined and the environmental effects influencing factors and diversity management were analyzed from 2000 to 2017 the temporal variations in the nani and napi first showed an increasing trend and then a decreasing trend with average nani and napi values of 7 292 kg n km 2 yr 1 and 2 306 kg p km 2 yr 1 respectively the spatial variations in the nani and napi at the provincial level are characterized by a decreasing trend from the east to the west as well as from the north to the south at the municipal level the cities with high nani and napi values are mostly concentrated in and around the urban agglomerations of the yangtze river delta middle reaches of the yangtze river and chengdu chongqing the results regarding the environmental effects show that higher net inputs of n and p due to human activities result in greater outputs of n and p in rivers and lakes which revealed the spatial pattern of the banded distribution and local concentration attribution analysis shows that changes in the economic factors contribute the most to the changes in the nani and napi with an average of 74 1 and 74 3 respectively followed by the land use factor with an average of 19 5 and 19 3 respectively the average social factors contribute the least to the changes in the nani and napi with 6 4 and 6 4 respectively differentiated management of each category helps to efficiently manage nutrients future improvement to the efficiencies of fertilizer and sewage treatments during agricultural production has a high potential to reduce the point and nonpoint source pollution loads while paying attention to the nutrient load in the waterbody it is essential to also focus on the nutrient load in the soil to further improve n and p input management systems credit authorship contribution statement chenning deng writing original draft writing review editing lusan liu

4631,the objective of this study is to examine the dynamic complexity of hydrologic basins using techniques of phase space reconstruction these non parametric model free techniques which have their basis in the theory of chaotic dynamical systems are advantageous in resurrecting the features of multivariable dynamics solely from one dimensional timeseries dynamic complexity is characterized by two measures directly interpretable as number of active degrees of freedom dimensionality and strength of nonlinearity the analysis is conducted on daily streamflow observations of 408 basins from the model parameter estimation project mopex dataset spanning a wide range of climatic topographic and land surface properties the results show that the two complexity measures vary considerably across basins however their distributions are positively skewed indicating that most basins exhibit low dimensionality and moderate nonlinearity by examining how dynamic complexity relate to a set of 15 basin properties it was found that dynamics dimensionality is primarily related to basin size precisely larger basins exhibit lower dimensional dynamics on the other hand strength of nonlinearity is found to be regulated by the extent of vegetation in land cover specifically basins with limited vegetation cover tend to have more linear dynamics furthermore some observations regarding the presence of chaotic dynamics and the relationship between dynamic complexity and accuracy of prediction are presented the results of this study have implications and potential relevance to catchment similarity and classification frameworks as well as model selection and extrapolation of model parameters to ungauged basins keywords nonlinear dynamics catchment classification hydrologic complexity 1 introduction the movement and storage of water within hydrologic basins are regulated by a multitude of processes operating at various spatiotemporal scales they include among others flow of water along hill slopes subsurface flow through porous media water uptake by plants and snowmelt in addition to the inherent nonlinearity of these processes their intricacy is further aggravated by the heterogeneity in landscape drainage network soil moisture vegetation as well as the variability of precipitation and net radiation the interplay among the aforementioned processes leads to emergent properties at the macroscale such properties essentially encapsulate the salient features of hydrological processes within the basin and they provide a parsimonious description of basin behavior the notion of basin complexity which refers to the number of dominant variables and the nonlinearity of processes governing watershed dynamics is often discussed as an element of a generic framework that seeks to characterize the essential signatures of watershed dynamics such a viewpoint so called top down or downward approach espoused by several hydrologists gupta et al 2008 klemeš 1983 mcdonnell et al 2007 sivapalan et al 2003 is considered to be useful to overcome the challenges facing watershed hydrology the interest in basin complexity stems primarily from its usefulness in catchment classification as it facilitates and provides a framework for transferring models and prediction in ungauged basins additionally it provides a basis for selection of models with appropriate complexity to resolve watershed dynamics in this latter regard basin complexity is closely tied to concepts of model parsimony parameters identifiability and criteria of model selection bai et al 2009 beven 2006 butts et al 2004 previous work on basin complexity has attempted to identify hydrologic complexity by extracting signatures from univariate or bivariate time series either observed or simulated for example jakeman and hornberger 1993 interpreted basin complexity as the number of parameters in a model that can be supported by the information contained in rainfall and streamflow observations alternatively castillo et al 2015 proposed an information theoretic entropy measure that characterizes the spatial variability of soil moisture within the basin as a complexity index they argued that soil moisture has first order control over the basin behavior as it modulates the indirect effects of other variables recently pande and moayeri 2018 used a statistical measure of complexity vapnik chervonenkis dimension along with streamflow observations to identify the complexity of 412 watersheds across the contiguous united states conus more related to the study presented here sivakumar and singh 2012 and vignesh et al 2015 utilized theories of chaotic dynamical systems namely time delay embedding and phase space reconstruction to identify the dimensionality of basins the former examined basin complexity at 117 gauging stations in the western united states and the latter identified basin dimensionality at 639 stations in conus in the present study we also rely on the theories of chaotic dynamical systems to identify complexity of hydrologic basins chaotic dynamical systems are characterized by an apparently random and erratic behavior despite being governed by nonlinear deterministic interactions the fundamental characteristic of a chaotic system is that initial states close to each other in value will lead to completely different trajectories of the system state at some time in the future this sensitivity of system behavior to initial conditions is the main property of a chaotic system on the other hand the deterministic nature of chaotic systems means that precise and complete identification of initial conditions imply a unique system trajectory in the future introductory overview to chaos theory methods for identification of chaos and tools for analysis of such systems can be found in gleick 2011 and ott 2002 whereas jayawardena 2013 provides an overview of chaos theory in relation to environmental and hydrological systems although the concept of chaos dates back to the 1960 s it was only until the late 1980 s that chaos theory was applied to the analysis of time series in environmental sciences this can be ascribed to the development of the time delay embedding theorem takens 1981 which facilitated the reconstruction of system dynamics in multidimensional phase space using solely time series of a single variable the idea that clues on the multivariate behavior of a system can be obtained from a one dimensional time series has led to a surge in chaotic analysis of hydrologic time series e g elshorbagy et al 2002 lall et al 1996 porporato ridolfi 1996 1997 rodriguez iturbe et al 1989 sangoyomi et al 1996 sharifi et al 1990 wilcox et al 1991 this early research was guided by two motives first searching for the presence of chaotic determinism in system dynamics second utilizing chaotic determinism as a practical tool for prediction and estimation besides these motives a recent interest has emerged that seeks to apply chaotic dynamical systems theories of time delay embedding for identifying the complexity of watershed dynamics sivakumar singh 2012 vignesh et al 2015 along these lines the present paper examines the identification of basin complexity using streamflow observations from 408 catchments of the model parameter estimation project mopex dataset our study is different than that of sivakumar and singh 2012 and vignesh et al 2015 in the following first while dynamic complexity was previously interpreted only as the number of dominant variables i e active degrees of freedom in a system we provide two distinct measures directly interpretable as number of active degrees of freedom and strength of nonlinearity second in the present paper techniques of phase space nonlinear prediction namely simplex sugihara may 1990 and s map sugihara 1994 are used to estimate complexity measures whereas the correlation dimension and false nearest neighbor methods were used in sivakumar singh 2012 and vignesh et al 2015 respectively third since mopex dataset provides climatic topographic and land surface characteristics of basins we examine in further detail than before how complexity measures relate to basin characteristics finally while sivakumar and singh 2012 and vignesh et al 2015 investigated the dimensionality of watersheds using streamflow observations at monthly scale we examine hydrologic complexity at the daily scale this last point is particularly important from the standpoint of short range watershed management and planning in which various aspects are considered at the daily scale e g flood forecasting the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the details of the mopex dataset used in this study section 3 describes the nonlinear prediction methods used to identify the two complexity measures a special focus is placed on the interpretation of the two measures as number of active degrees of freedom and strength of nonlinearity section 4 reports the results of the analysis accompanied by discussion on the variability of complexity across watersheds and how it relates to basin characteristics section 5 sums up the findings of the paper and draws conclusions 2 data the model parameter estimation project mopex dataset duan et al 2006 schaake et al 2006 was assembled to provide hydrometeorological data from a large number of basins for parameterization of hydrologic and land surface models the dataset provides high quality hydrometeorological observations of key variables e g streamflow precipitation maximum and minimum daily temperature etc as well as basin characteristics for 431 catchments in conus mopex daily streamflow observations the primary data used in this study are a subset of usgs hydro climatic data network hcdn streamflow observations this dataset is suitable for climatic studies since it only consists of basins free from upstream flow regulations such as artificial diversions and storage here we exclude stations with a record length 30 years the remaining stations 408 shown in fig 1 a cover most regions of conus albeit they are relatively sparse in western us in addition the basins span a wide range of hydrologic climatic and land surface characteristics fig 1b shows the histogram of basins area which spans four orders of magnitude with a range of 67 10 329 k m 2 the climate in the basins as defined by the dryness index di ratio of mean annual potential evapotranspiration pet to mean annual precipitation p varies considerably from wet and humid di 0 2 to hyper arid di 3 see fig 1c in addition to the streamflow observations mopex dataset provides several climatic topographic and geomorphologic characteristics of basins table 1 lists basin characteristics and their notations used in this study for the purpose of investigating their control on dynamic complexity 3 methods let s consider an m dimensional dynamical system that is the system dynamics arise from a set of m variables this set is denoted by x k where k 1 2 m at any time t the system can be represented in the phase space by the m dimensional point 1 x t x 1 t x 2 t x m t note that we use uppercase letter x k to denote the entire time series of variable k lowercase letter x k t to denote a single observation of x k at time t and bold lowercase letter x t to denote a single observation in the phase space at time t in the case where only a single variable is observed e g x 1 the theory of time delay embedding takens 1981 see also packard et al 1980 demonstrates that the topological features of the system manifold in the phase space is preserved if the system is represented by the time series of variable x 1 and its values shifted by a fixed delay time τ for convenience we shall remove the subscript in x 1 hereafter since only a single variable is considered therefore at any time t the system is represented by the e dimensional point 2 x t x t x t τ x t 2 τ x t e 1 τ where e is the embedding dimension note that e is not necessarily equal to the true dimension of the system m also the delay time τ is a multiple of the sampling time step δ t thus the smallest value of τ is δ t in the present paper the observed variable x is streamflow whereas the remaining m 1 variables are unobserved these variables correspond to rainfall soil moisture air temperature etc therefore we consider hereafter the phase space representation given by equation 2 our two measures of dynamic complexity of hydrological basins are estimated from two methods generally categorized as nonlinear prediction methods essentially nonlinear prediction entails that there exists a function in the e dimensional phase space that describes the evolution of the system as follows 3 x t t f t x t where t is the prediction horizon i e how far ahead and f t is a function that maps the phase space representation of the system at time t to the future state at time t t it is possible that an approximation of the function f t can be computed from the samples to predict the future state of x t as follows 4 x t t f t x t the function f t is local i e depends on the location of x t in the phase space and nonlinear hence the name nonlinear prediction within the field of chaos theory several methods have been proposed to approximate f t here we consider two methods namely the simplex nonlinear prediction method sugihara may 1990 and the sequential locally weighted global linear maps s map sugihara 1994 by means of these methods two complexity measures can be identified one is a proxy of the system dimensionality i e active degrees of freedom and the other is an indicator of the strength of nonlinearity the two following subsections will briefly describe the two nonlinear prediction methods and the corresponding complexity indices 3 1 simplex method and identification of optimum embedding dimension as discussed above the objective of simplex method sugihara may 1990 is to approximate the function f t in equation 4 in doing so the simplex method starts by constructing the manifold in the phase space using equation 2 specifically the manifold is constructed using the trajectory of the e dimensional point x t for time series of length l an example of such a manifold is shown in fig 2 a which is constructed from streamflow observations at gauging station id 01560000 note that in this case the phase space is 3 dimensional e 3 if x l t is to be predicted the e dimensional point x l is located in the phase space and then its e 1 nearest neighbors are identified next the locations of the e 1 points on the phase space after t time steps are identified finally x l t is obtained by calculating a weighted average of these locations the weights are exponential based on the distances of nearest neighbors from the point x l the intuition here is that the future system state can be predicted from the behavior of past values that are similar to the current state with similarity being defined as closeness in the phase space the simplex method can be used to estimate an optimum embedding dimension hereafter referred to as e opt this is done by iteratively selecting an e value e 1 2 3 and using a subset of the observed time series to predict the remaining values for each e value the predicted and observed values are compared using correlation coefficient ρ the value of e that achieves best prediction maximum ρ is the optimum embedding dimension simply e opt is the dimension that effectively unfolds system dynamics in the phase space as it eliminates singularities and trajectory crossings it is therefore an indicator of the true system dimensionality m formally whitney embedding theorem whitney 1944 gives the following inequality e opt 2 m 1 this means that e opt provides an upper bound on the true system dimensionality however because the time series we use in this study are finite and not noise free e opt is only regarded to be proportional to m not a strict upper bound on m fig 2b shows prediction accuracy for a range of e values using the same streamflow time series in fig 2a in this case the optimum embedding dimension is 3 3 2 s map method and identification of nonlinearity index the essential idea of the s map method sugihara 1994 for the prediction of x t t is to utilize a regression function that maps the e 1 dimensional vector x t to the one dimensional point x t t i e r e 1 r 1 using the following equation 5 x t t k 1 e 1 c k x k t here x t is equivalent to the e dimensional point x t augmented by adding a constant term specifically x 1 t 1 and x k t for k 2 3 e 1 is equivalent to the point x t the coefficient values c k in equation 5 are estimated from the constructed phase space in particular if the phase space is constructed using a streamflow time series of length l and the streamflow x l t is to be predicted we can re write equation 5 in matrix format with a slight modification as follows 6 b n 1 a n e 1 c e 1 1 where 7 b w x t x l x t t 8 a w x t x l x t c in equation 6 is the vector of coefficients c k note that the number of rows in both a and b is denoted by n which is equal to the number of x t points that don t share coordinates with the point x l equation 6 is modified from equation 5 by introducing a weighting factor w this factor depends on the euclidean distances in the phase space x t x l and it is calculated as follows 9 w d e θ d d here d is the distance x t x l and d is the average of distances for all values of t the parameter θ takes values in the range 0 if the value of θ is zero w d 1 regardless of the distance in other words all points in the phase space are assigned equal weights this is equivalent to fitting a global linear map on all points x t in the phase space on the contrary if θ is large points in the neighborhood of x l i e smaller d are assigned larger weights and the weights decreases exponentially as a function of the distance put simply as θ takes larger values the function f t becomes more local and nonlinear an indicator of the system nonlinearity can be estimated using s map specifically successive values of θ starting from zero are chosen and prediction accuracy ρ for each value is calculated the value that maximizes prediction which is denoted here by θ opt is identified and considered to be a measure of the system nonlinearity values of θ opt near zero indicates that the behavior of the system is linear whereas larger values of θ opt means that more accurate prediction can be achieved by considering local neighborhood as opposed to the global phase space this latter case clearly indicates the existence of state dependent nonlinear behavior it should be noted that s map has previously been used to identify systems nonlinearity sugihara 1994 fig 2c shows prediction accuracy as a function of θ where the value of θ opt is 3 the fundamental interpretation of θ opt as a nonlinearity index is more precise than the general definition of nonlinear systems as systems in which output changes are not proportional to input changes nonlinearity in such a broad sense might stem from a variety of forms e g polynomials of degrees higher than one exponential etc however θ opt is closely tied to state dependent behavior essentially it is a parameter of equation 4 and it is obtained by optimizing the function in equation 4 to yield best predictions therefore a low value of θ opt e g θ opt 0 means that a single function of f t in equation 4 is valid to represent streamflow regardless of the basin dynamical state on the contrary a high value of θ opt indicate that f t is highly sensitive to the basin dynamical state 3 3 testing for statistical significance using surrogates in order to obtain confidence on the values of complexity indices and to ensure that the process is indeed a form of chaotic determinism we resort to the use of surrogates the essential idea of testing for statistical significance using surrogates is to first define a null hypothesis on the underlying process that generated the observed time series surrogates are then generated in accordance with the null hypothesis and a discriminating metric is computed from both the original time series and surrogates finally the null hypothesis is rejected if the value of the metric is different from its distribution in the surrogate time series a hierarchy of null hypotheses can be adopted for testing the significance of nonlinear dynamics the simplest of which is to assume that the observed time series is the result of independent and identically distributed i i d random variable however under many circumstances this hypothesis is insufficient and a stricter null hypothesis is required several methods have been proposed in the literature to generate surrogate data consistent with different null hypotheses e g kugiumtzis 2000 schreiber schmitz 1996 theiler et al 1992 here we use an algorithm that randomizes the phases of the fourier transform of the original timeseries and it preserves the mean variance and autocorrelation i e fourier spectrum this algorithm is described in theiler et al 1992 see also osborne et al 1986 essentially the original timeseries is transformed to the frequency domain then the phases at all frequencies are randomized in a symmetrical manner for positive and negative frequencies finally surrogate timeseries is obtained by transforming the phase randomized fourier spectrum back to the time domain see theiler et al 1992 for detailed description in the present study we generate 100 surrogates for each timeseries of streamflow throughout our analysis we compute any metric of interest for both the original timeseries and the 100 surrogates there are three metrics that are considered in this study 1 the accuracy of nonlinear prediction expressed as correlation coefficient ρ 2 the optimum embedding dimension e opt and 3 the optimum nonlinearity index θ opt let q denote any of these three metrics computed for the original timeseries whereas μ q and σ q are the mean and standard deviation of the metric computed from the 100 surrogates the statistical significance is then computed as follows 10 s q μ q σ q s indicates how distant the metric q is from μ q in terms of units of standard deviation σ q the distribution of q in the surrogates is assumed to be gaussian and a simple one sided p value can be computed to evaluate the statistical significance of any metric q 4 results and discussion 4 1 presence of chaotic dynamics simplex and s map methods were applied on each streamflow timeseries of the 413 mopex basins before we report the results on hydrologic complexity an analysis is conducted to examine the presence of chaotic behavior in each streamflow timeseries the analysis is performed by computing prediction accuracy ρ for both the original timeseries and surrogates the statistical significance is then computed according to section 3 3 a basin is considered to exhibit chaotic dynamics if the prediction accuracy of the original timeseries is greater than that of the surrogate distribution with a p value less than the statistical significance level α of 0 05 a statistically significant p value means that the phase space representation provides useful information for prediction beyond what is contained in the autocorrelation in other words there exists an underlying dynamical attractor with coherent structure such that it can be exploited to achieve better prediction on the contrary if the basin behavior is not controlled by chaotic dynamics the obtained prediction accuracy ρ of the original timeseries will be within the distribution of ρ in the surrogates this latter case will result in a high p value and the null hypothesis is accepted it is worth mentioning that this analysis is not a conclusive test for the presence of chaotic dynamics which as noted by porporato and ridolfi 1997 can only be achieved by applying a variety of techniques complementary to each other it is nonetheless useful to pinpoint the existence of a weakest component of chaotic dynamics and it allows us to account for autocorrelation effects in the timeseries it should also be noted that for the sake of comparison we computed lyapunov exponent jayawardena 2013 hegger et al 1999 for each hydrologic basin in order to assess the presence of chaos using other measures the results see supplementary material show that 95 2 of the basins that were identified as chaotic according to the simplex method also show a positive lyapunov exponent which indicates the presence of chaos fig 3 a shows a part of the 1 day ahead streamflow forecasts at usgs gauging station id 1631000 located in virginia we use 70 of the observations to construct the phase space and then validate the accuracy of nonlinear prediction in the remaining 30 of the record fig 3b shows the scatterplot of observed and forecasted streamflow with correlation coefficient ρ of 0 78 fig 3c shows the histogram of forecast accuracy obtained for the 100 surrogates their mean and standard deviation are 0 73 and 0 004 respectively by assuming a gaussian distribution with these values for mean and standard deviation shown in black in fig 3c a p value can be computed which in this case is equal to 3 10 36 therefore the basin is considered to exhibit chaotic behavior note that the difference in ρ between the surrogates and the original time series is not substantial mainly because of the high autocorrelation in daily streamflow at this basin thus if one is only interested in the practical aspect of forecasting a persistence model of streamflow krajewski et al 2020 ghimire and krajewski 2020 would yield comparable results to that of nonlinear prediction on the basis of the aforementioned analysis it was found that chaotic behavior exists at 268 basins of the 408 mopex basins note that only these basins will be considered for analysis in the remaining sections of this article it is interesting to examine whether the presence of chaotic dynamics can be explained in terms of basin characteristics by carefully examining all basin characteristics table 1 we found that psi and snowfraction exert first order control on the presence of chaotic behavior fig 4 presents a scatterplot of both chaotic and non chaotic basins and their variability in terms of psi and snowfraction most basins that have psi values 0 25 indicating more uniform rainfall throughout the year are chaotic moreover it appears that basins with snow fraction more than 0 4 are mostly non chaotic specifically 72 of the basins with psi 0 25 and snowfraction 0 4 are chaotic whereas 81 of the basins with greater than 0 4 of snowfraction are non chaotic this last observation is consistent with previous results reported by wilcox et al 1991 who examined a daily record of snowmelt runoff from a basin in southwestern idaho and they found no evidence of chaotic dynamics moreover the relationship between psi and presence of chaotic behavior seems to be in agreement with the work of sivakumar and singh 2012 although they did not examine explicitly the impact of psi on chaotic dynamics their analysis over the western us revealed that most sites with unidentifiable dimensionality i e no clear chaotic behavior are located in semi arid southwestern us southern california and arizona which have high rainfall seasonality i e large psi admittedly the distinction of chaotic dynamics based on these two characteristics while clear on the extremes is blurry for a range of psi and snowfraction values for instance there exists an overlap of chaotic and non chaotic basins for the region psi 0 25 and snowfraction 0 4 this is however expected since the interplay of a myriad of other factors could potentially affect the presence of nonlinear dynamics 4 2 hydrologic complexity and its variability simplex and s map were applied to the 268 basins that showed evidence of chaotic dynamics in order to estimate e opt values of e in the range 1 20 were iteratively selected to compute accuracy of prediction for a prediction horizon of 1 day t 1 as for the nonlinearity index θ opt θ was iteratively selected from the values 0 0 05 0 075 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 4 0 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 15 in order to obtain statistical confidence on the values of e opt and θ opt we computed their statistical significance according to the surrogate test in section 3 3 because we seek to identify low dimensional nonlinear chaotic behavior any given value of e opt is considered statistically significant if it is smaller than its surrogate distribution at a significance level of 0 05 conversely θ opt is considered statically significant if its value is larger than its surrogate distribution fig 5 shows the joint and marginal distributions of e opt and θ opt basins shown in dark blue are the ones where both complexity indices are statistically significant also the histograms in fig 5 show the marginal distribution of statistically significant e opt and θ opt the following observations may be made 1 there is a large variability in basin complexity with e opt and θ opt in the ranges 1 12 and 0 15 respectively 2 a tradeoff between e opt and θ opt exists consequently very few basins exhibit both high number of active degrees of freedom and extreme nonlinearity this is demonstrated by the negative slope of the joint density contour lines 3 the dynamics in a large number of basins has a small number of active degrees of freedom this can be seen from the positively skewed distribution of e opt with a median 4 black dashed line 4 similarly the distribution of θ opt is positively skewed with a long right tail and a median approximately equal to 4 suggesting that dynamics in most basins is moderately nonlinear and very few basins exhibit highly nonlinear dynamics it is noteworthy to point out that the way in which the two complexity indices were identified is analogous to bayesian statistics specifically we assumed non informative uniform prior distributions of e opt and θ opt with ranges 1 20 and 0 15 respectively consequently the histograms of marginal distributions shown in fig 5 can be viewed as the posterior distributions of e opt and θ opt it is also worth mentioning that previously reported results on dynamics dimensionality points to a similar distribution patterns to the ones observed here in particular vignesh et al 2015 who used false nearest neighbor approach to identify the dimensionality reported a positively skewed distribution for dimensionality of 639 basins in conus specifically 75 of the basins they analyzed had a dimension below or equal to 6 similar observations can be found in the work of sivakumar and singh 2012 in their analysis of 117 basins in western us taking into consideration that both studies used different techniques to examine system dimensionality and focused on monthly time scale unlike the present study this could potentially indicate that the results are independent of the time scale and the techniques used for analysis we also note that for the sake of comparison we utilized the false nearest neighbors fnn method to estimate the optimum embedding dimension jayawardena 2013 kennel et al 1992 the results see supplementary material show that the estimates obtained from fnn are within 2 for 80 of the basins which indicate that the results are not substantially different when other methods are used to identify the optimum embedding dimension 4 3 impact of basin characteristics on hydrologic complexity here we examine the impact of basin characteristics on the value of the two complexity indices e opt and θ opt the total number of basin characteristics is 15 listed in table 1 which includes topographic climatic and land surface properties table 2 shows the spearman correlation coefficient r s between each of the 15 basin characteristics and the two complexity indices only basins where both complexity indices are statistically significant were considered for this analysis clearly e opt is primarily related to topographic properties of the basin such as area elevation slope stream length and drainage density i e p value of r s 0 05 the most significant relationship is with basin area r s 0 33 which is shown in fig 6 a specifically basins with larger areas tend to have lower dimensionality i e low active degrees of freedom this can be attributed to the fact that large basins are more effective in filtering out the random behavior induced by basin heterogeneities and rainfall variability as a result multiple degrees of freedom are subdued and the dynamics reduce to very few dimensions this is also in agreement with previous findings that streamflow forecasting in larger basins is more accurate than in small basins parajka et al 2013 zalenski et al 2017 which might be attributed to the low number of active degrees of freedom in large basins in particular the smoothing effect of large basins has long been hypothesized as the reason of why hydrologic models tend to perform better in large basins e g nester et al 2011 however empirical observations that link the size of basin area to dynamics dimensionality remained to be elusive in most studies e g liu et al 1998 in addition to the impact of basin area on e opt there are also significant correlations with channel slope and stream length with r s values of 0 32 and 0 29 respectively see fig 6b and c the relationship regarding stream length can be viewed as a result of the strong covariance between stream length and basin area particularly larger basins will most likely be associated with longer stream length indeed the spearman correlation coefficient between basin area and stream length is 0 89 on the other hand the positive correlation between e opt and channel slope indicate that flashier basins have large dimensionality of dynamics in other words holding all other variables constant an increase in channel slope means that the runoff response to rainfall is more direct the basin is flashier and the dimensionality of dynamics is large if one is to relate high values of e opt to low performance of models then several studies have previously indicated that the difficulty of modelling catchments increases with flashiness e g lidén harlin 2000 yatheendradas et al 2008 although the flashiness was attributed to climate properties and not to channel slope it is noteworthy that pande and moayeri 2018 reported an opposite relationship that high slope is associated with lower complexity however they also highlighted that this relationship is only evident within a specific group of steep basins in their case study i e it is not a general pattern lastly e opt has significant correlations with elevation and drainage density d d these two relationships might be viewed as a result of covariation with basin area stream length and channel slope in particular elevation and channel slope are correlated with r s 0 62 d d on the other hand covaries with basin area as it is defined as the ratio of stream length to basin area moreover the positive correlation between d d and e opt can be interpreted based on the fact that d d is an indicator of the interaction between groundwater and surface water at the basin scale more specifically a higher value of d d indicates less permeability of the surface and flashier response of the basin thus increasing the dynamic dimensionality for instance le moine 2008 shows that there is a significant correlation between d d and high flows i e flashier response the upshot of the results regarding the impact of basin properties on e opt is that low dimensional dynamics are present in large basins that filter out and smooth heterogeneities whereas basins with higher slope smaller size and flashier behavior are governed by large degrees of freedom it is worth mentioning that the relationship with basin size was observed in the work of vignesh et al 2015 furthermore other studies that reported the presence of low dimensional chaotic dynamics in streamflow were mostly limited to large basins for instance the aosta valley basin with an area of 3313 k m 2 porporato ridolfi 1997 it is also important to note that there is a wide scatter in all relationships and the values of e opt are not fully explained by the size and slope of basins this is however expected since the dynamics dimensionality arises from the interplay of several factors and it is far more complex than to be explained by a single variable unlike e opt which is primarily modulated by topographic properties of the basin presence of nonlinearity indicated by the value of θ opt is only correlated at α 0 05 with the type of vegetation cover r s 0 27 fig 6d shows the relationship between the nonlinearity index θ opt and the dominating international geosphere biosphere programme igbp land cover class there are 17 igbp land cover classes shown in appendix ranging from evergreen forests classes 1 and 2 to built up land and water bodies classes 13 and 17 the igbp land cover in the basins used for the analysis in this section are almost limited to classes 1 through 13 the gradient of igbp classes from low class 1 to high class 13 represents the gradient in spatial and temporal extent of canopy cover from evergreen forests to built up lands therefore the negative correlation shown in fig 6d indicates that basins with no or very limited canopy cover i e classes 11 13 tend to behave more linearly whereas extensive vegetation is associated with more nonlinear dynamics it is plausible to interpret these results in terms of the complex impact of canopy cover on evapotranspiration infiltration and interception storage the nonlinearity indicated by the index θ opt is particularly related to state dependent behavior essentially a high value of θ opt indicates that the temporal evolution of streamflow is highly sensitive to the dynamical state of the basin in light of this fundamental understanding the relationship between θ opt and vegetation cover can be explained through the sponge effect hypothesis bruijnzeel 2004 generally this hypothesis highlights the nonlinear state dependent behavior of watersheds dominated by extensive vegetation cover i e forests and it postulates that the existence of forests reduces runoff peaks and annual runoff but it enhances infiltration leading to increased streamflow during the dry season there are several studies that examined this hypothesis ogden et al 2013 using a paired catchment methodology showed evidences of the sponge effect hypothesis the relationship with vegetation cover is also consistent with previous studies that linked higher basin complexity to vegetation with more storage capacity pande moayeri 2018 although that there is not an extensive literature on the explicit impact of vegetation cover on complexity of dynamics it appears to be intuitive that more vegetation cover aggravates the nonlinearity of basins through its complex impact on evapotranspiration infiltration and interception 4 4 hydrologic complexity and predictability how does hydrologic complexity as defined by e opt and θ opt relates to predictability of daily streamflow here we seek to shed light on this question which have important implications for modelling and prediction of streamflow by providing some preliminary observations since nonlinear prediction based on phase space reconstruction is completely model free and independent of structural assumptions the accuracy of nonlinear prediction is a function of the underlying dynamics and is often interpreted as a proxy of predictability therefore previous studies have utilized accuracy of nonlinear prediction and its decay with prediction horizon to distinguish noise from chaotic dynamics sugihara may 1990 tsonis elsner 1992 and examine lyapunov exponent farmer and sidorowich 1987 grassberger et al 1991 here we examine whether any clear patterns can be inferred if the predictions for basins are grouped based on the values of the two complexity measures fig 7 shows the accuracy of nonlinear streamflow forecasts for prediction horizons of 1 2 3 5 7 10 and 14 days as a function of e opt continuous lines in fig 7a and θ opt fig 7b in both figures three groups of e opt and θ opt termed low medium and high are identified and prediction accuracy is averaged for all basins within each group note that the grouping is based on equal counts interestingly there is a clear relationship between basin dimensionality e opt and prediction accuracy precisely prediction accuracy is higher for basins with low dimensionality and it decreases consistently for basins with higher dimensions this relationship is consistent for prediction horizons of 1 day up to 2 weeks on the other hand the reverse relationship can be observed between θ opt and prediction accuracy particularly prediction accuracy is higher for nonlinear basins and it decrease consistently for basins with more linearity in both cases the prediction decay rate appears to be independent of e opt and θ opt one might immediately tend to think that the observed impact of e opt on prediction accuracy reflects its dependence on basin area specifically as discussed in the previous subsection larger basins have lower dimensionality it is therefore plausible that larger basins have higher prediction accuracy due to their long memory autocorrelation it is noteworthy that increased streamflow prediction as a function of basin area was previously reported parajka et al 2013 viglione et al 2013 in order to test this hypothesis basins are classified into three equal counts groups of basin area low medium and high the results are shown as the dashed lines in fig 7a while it appears that this grouping based on basin area have some resemblance to the one based on e opt the distinction is not as sharp as the grouping based on e opt this preliminary observation is worthy of further examination and it is an indication that dynamic complexity as defined by e opt and θ opt provides insights on nonlinear phase space prediction accuracy beyond what is entailed by basin properties such as basin area 5 conclusions this study attempted to examine the qualitative character of watershed dynamics by applying techniques of chaotic dynamical systems namely phase space reconstruction and nonlinear prediction their main advantage is that they are nonparametric and data driven thus they are independent of structural assumptions in hydrologic models while previous studies that used techniques of chaotic dynamical systems interpreted dynamic complexity in terms of a single measure indicating system dimensionality we provided two measures of dynamic complexity the first measure e opt provides an estimation of system dimensionality i e number of active degrees of freedom whereas the second measure θ opt is a proxy for the strength of dynamics nonlinearity an analysis on 408 basins from the mopex dataset representing a wide range of climatic topographic and land surface characteristics was conducted and the main findings are as follows based on surrogate test to identify whether a component of deterministic chaos exists it was found that 268 of the 408 basins exhibit chaotic dynamics further investigation revealed that snow fraction and rainfall seasonality psi exert first order control on the presence of chaotic dynamics specifically rainfed i e low snow fraction basins with lower psi i e more uniform rainfall tend to exhibit chaotic behavior values of complexity measures for the 268 basins show a wide range of variability with e opt and θ opt in the range of 1 12 and 0 15 respectively however the distribution of both measures is positively skewed with 50 of basins having a value of e opt and θ opt below 4 this means that the dynamics in most basins is moderately nonlinear and have a low number of active degrees of freedom the dynamic dimensionality number of active degrees of freedom as estimated by e opt is found to be primarily related to basin area specifically larger basins tend to have lower dimensionality this is attributed to the impact of large basins in filtering out heterogeneities within the basin e opt is also positively correlated with channel slope indicating that flashier basins have large dimensionality unlike dynamic dimensionality the nonlinearity of dynamics is found to be regulated by the type of vegetation cover in the basin specifically basins with year round extensive vegetation cover are associated with nonlinear dynamics preliminary results show that grouping of basins in terms of the value of e opt and θ opt provides insights on prediction accuracy of daily streamflow for prediction horizons of 1 day up to 2 weeks in particular it is shown that low dimensional nonlinear dynamics lead to higher prediction accuracy generally the relatively large number of basins that were shown to exhibit chaotic dynamics based on the surrogate test corroborates previous assertions that hydrologic catchments are systems of organized complexity falling between the extremes of randomness and organized simplicity dooge 1986 regarding our findings on the impact of basin properties on complexity indices some comparisons can be inferred from previous studies that examined catchment similarity for instance it has been previously shown that basin size is strongly related to hydrologic model performance e g das et al 2008 hellebrand van den bos 2008 merz et al 2009 oudin et al 2008 zalenski et al 2017 although several arguments were put forward to explain this relationship it is most likely that the low dimensional dynamics of large basins lead to this relationship similarly the slope of catchments was previously shown to provide some control on classifying catchments into distinct groups in northeastern united states sawicz et al 2011 other studies highlighted that climate controls are significant in classification of basins in particular it is often found that modelling and prediction in arid catchments is more challenging than in humid catchments e g pande moayeri 2018 parajka et al 2013 most of these studies followed a line of reasoning that is based on prediction accuracy that is hydrologic models tend to perform poorly in arid catchments in the present study we did not observe significant correlations between climate properties and the two complexity indices however it should be noted that there exists a negative correlation significant at α 0 15 between the dryness of a catchment and the nonlinearity index see table 2 while this relationship seems to be contradictory to previously reported results we note that stronger nonlinearity should not be confused with poorer prediction accuracy in fact fig 7b shows that prediction accuracy is better for basins with higher values of θ opt it is also important to note that the conclusions drawn from this study should be viewed in the context of the assumptions implied in the nonlinear prediction methods namely simplex and s map the results might differ slightly if other assumptions are incorporated for instance pande and moayeri 2018 used the concept of difficult streamflow events in accordance with the assumption that complexity emerges from otherwise noisy background thus their complexity measure is significantly correlated with all hydroclimatic characteristics as it is with all data driven techniques the robustness of results is limited by the two factors sample length and the presence of observational noise the former is less likely to imperil the findings of the present paper because relatively large samples were used in the analysis specifically we only kept stations with streamflow record longer than 30 years of the remaining stations approximately 80 have record longer than 50 years this corresponds to sample length larger than 18 250 as for the presence of noise no attempts were made here to examine or remove noise from streamflow observations this is mainly because the observations are part of the hcdn dataset which has been subjected to quality control and it is widely used in hydrologic studies it is worth mentioning however that methods for noise reduction in chaotic dynamical analysis has previously been proposed e g jayawardena gurung 2000 another limitation of this study is that the temporal resolution of the data is limited to the daily scale observations at this time scale may average and obscure the dynamical response of the system especially for small basins ghimire et al 2020 the results presented here have implications and potential relevance to several applications as it provides a basis for catchment classification based on similarity of dynamic complexity this is particularly useful because the approach we used is data driven and it is not limited by our ability to represent and model hydrologic processes this property is often preferred in catchment classification systems beven 2011 wagener et al 2007 the findings that relate basin characteristics to the dynamic complexity measures presented in this study can be useful in obtaining a proxy for the complexity of system dynamics in ungauged basins consequently this allows making informative decisions regarding extrapolation of hydrologic model parameters to ungauged basins and selection of reference streamflow gauges archfield vogel 2010 arguably this is more advantageous compared to commonly used approaches of spatial proximity to extrapolate parameters to ungauged basins this can be demonstrated in fig 8 which shows the spatial distribution of the two complexity measures for all stations the values of e opt fig 8a are substantially heterogenous and the distribution of θ opt fig 8b albeit to some extent homogenous shows local variability these observations suggest that using spatial proximity for regionalization of model parameters is flawed because proximity does not reflect similarity of dynamic complexity moreover since the measures presented in this study estimate both dynamic dimensionality and nonlinearity separately they potentially have implications in model selection specifically to guide the selection of models with appropriate complexity both in terms of strength of nonlinearity and number of active degrees of freedom that is well suited to resolve watershed dynamics finally we also note that the results presented here may have implications and guide the application of data driven e g deep learning approaches to streamflow

4631,the objective of this study is to examine the dynamic complexity of hydrologic basins using techniques of phase space reconstruction these non parametric model free techniques which have their basis in the theory of chaotic dynamical systems are advantageous in resurrecting the features of multivariable dynamics solely from one dimensional timeseries dynamic complexity is characterized by two measures directly interpretable as number of active degrees of freedom dimensionality and strength of nonlinearity the analysis is conducted on daily streamflow observations of 408 basins from the model parameter estimation project mopex dataset spanning a wide range of climatic topographic and land surface properties the results show that the two complexity measures vary considerably across basins however their distributions are positively skewed indicating that most basins exhibit low dimensionality and moderate nonlinearity by examining how dynamic complexity relate to a set of 15 basin properties it was found that dynamics dimensionality is primarily related to basin size precisely larger basins exhibit lower dimensional dynamics on the other hand strength of nonlinearity is found to be regulated by the extent of vegetation in land cover specifically basins with limited vegetation cover tend to have more linear dynamics furthermore some observations regarding the presence of chaotic dynamics and the relationship between dynamic complexity and accuracy of prediction are presented the results of this study have implications and potential relevance to catchment similarity and classification frameworks as well as model selection and extrapolation of model parameters to ungauged basins keywords nonlinear dynamics catchment classification hydrologic complexity 1 introduction the movement and storage of water within hydrologic basins are regulated by a multitude of processes operating at various spatiotemporal scales they include among others flow of water along hill slopes subsurface flow through porous media water uptake by plants and snowmelt in addition to the inherent nonlinearity of these processes their intricacy is further aggravated by the heterogeneity in landscape drainage network soil moisture vegetation as well as the variability of precipitation and net radiation the interplay among the aforementioned processes leads to emergent properties at the macroscale such properties essentially encapsulate the salient features of hydrological processes within the basin and they provide a parsimonious description of basin behavior the notion of basin complexity which refers to the number of dominant variables and the nonlinearity of processes governing watershed dynamics is often discussed as an element of a generic framework that seeks to characterize the essential signatures of watershed dynamics such a viewpoint so called top down or downward approach espoused by several hydrologists gupta et al 2008 klemeš 1983 mcdonnell et al 2007 sivapalan et al 2003 is considered to be useful to overcome the challenges facing watershed hydrology the interest in basin complexity stems primarily from its usefulness in catchment classification as it facilitates and provides a framework for transferring models and prediction in ungauged basins additionally it provides a basis for selection of models with appropriate complexity to resolve watershed dynamics in this latter regard basin complexity is closely tied to concepts of model parsimony parameters identifiability and criteria of model selection bai et al 2009 beven 2006 butts et al 2004 previous work on basin complexity has attempted to identify hydrologic complexity by extracting signatures from univariate or bivariate time series either observed or simulated for example jakeman and hornberger 1993 interpreted basin complexity as the number of parameters in a model that can be supported by the information contained in rainfall and streamflow observations alternatively castillo et al 2015 proposed an information theoretic entropy measure that characterizes the spatial variability of soil moisture within the basin as a complexity index they argued that soil moisture has first order control over the basin behavior as it modulates the indirect effects of other variables recently pande and moayeri 2018 used a statistical measure of complexity vapnik chervonenkis dimension along with streamflow observations to identify the complexity of 412 watersheds across the contiguous united states conus more related to the study presented here sivakumar and singh 2012 and vignesh et al 2015 utilized theories of chaotic dynamical systems namely time delay embedding and phase space reconstruction to identify the dimensionality of basins the former examined basin complexity at 117 gauging stations in the western united states and the latter identified basin dimensionality at 639 stations in conus in the present study we also rely on the theories of chaotic dynamical systems to identify complexity of hydrologic basins chaotic dynamical systems are characterized by an apparently random and erratic behavior despite being governed by nonlinear deterministic interactions the fundamental characteristic of a chaotic system is that initial states close to each other in value will lead to completely different trajectories of the system state at some time in the future this sensitivity of system behavior to initial conditions is the main property of a chaotic system on the other hand the deterministic nature of chaotic systems means that precise and complete identification of initial conditions imply a unique system trajectory in the future introductory overview to chaos theory methods for identification of chaos and tools for analysis of such systems can be found in gleick 2011 and ott 2002 whereas jayawardena 2013 provides an overview of chaos theory in relation to environmental and hydrological systems although the concept of chaos dates back to the 1960 s it was only until the late 1980 s that chaos theory was applied to the analysis of time series in environmental sciences this can be ascribed to the development of the time delay embedding theorem takens 1981 which facilitated the reconstruction of system dynamics in multidimensional phase space using solely time series of a single variable the idea that clues on the multivariate behavior of a system can be obtained from a one dimensional time series has led to a surge in chaotic analysis of hydrologic time series e g elshorbagy et al 2002 lall et al 1996 porporato ridolfi 1996 1997 rodriguez iturbe et al 1989 sangoyomi et al 1996 sharifi et al 1990 wilcox et al 1991 this early research was guided by two motives first searching for the presence of chaotic determinism in system dynamics second utilizing chaotic determinism as a practical tool for prediction and estimation besides these motives a recent interest has emerged that seeks to apply chaotic dynamical systems theories of time delay embedding for identifying the complexity of watershed dynamics sivakumar singh 2012 vignesh et al 2015 along these lines the present paper examines the identification of basin complexity using streamflow observations from 408 catchments of the model parameter estimation project mopex dataset our study is different than that of sivakumar and singh 2012 and vignesh et al 2015 in the following first while dynamic complexity was previously interpreted only as the number of dominant variables i e active degrees of freedom in a system we provide two distinct measures directly interpretable as number of active degrees of freedom and strength of nonlinearity second in the present paper techniques of phase space nonlinear prediction namely simplex sugihara may 1990 and s map sugihara 1994 are used to estimate complexity measures whereas the correlation dimension and false nearest neighbor methods were used in sivakumar singh 2012 and vignesh et al 2015 respectively third since mopex dataset provides climatic topographic and land surface characteristics of basins we examine in further detail than before how complexity measures relate to basin characteristics finally while sivakumar and singh 2012 and vignesh et al 2015 investigated the dimensionality of watersheds using streamflow observations at monthly scale we examine hydrologic complexity at the daily scale this last point is particularly important from the standpoint of short range watershed management and planning in which various aspects are considered at the daily scale e g flood forecasting the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 presents the details of the mopex dataset used in this study section 3 describes the nonlinear prediction methods used to identify the two complexity measures a special focus is placed on the interpretation of the two measures as number of active degrees of freedom and strength of nonlinearity section 4 reports the results of the analysis accompanied by discussion on the variability of complexity across watersheds and how it relates to basin characteristics section 5 sums up the findings of the paper and draws conclusions 2 data the model parameter estimation project mopex dataset duan et al 2006 schaake et al 2006 was assembled to provide hydrometeorological data from a large number of basins for parameterization of hydrologic and land surface models the dataset provides high quality hydrometeorological observations of key variables e g streamflow precipitation maximum and minimum daily temperature etc as well as basin characteristics for 431 catchments in conus mopex daily streamflow observations the primary data used in this study are a subset of usgs hydro climatic data network hcdn streamflow observations this dataset is suitable for climatic studies since it only consists of basins free from upstream flow regulations such as artificial diversions and storage here we exclude stations with a record length 30 years the remaining stations 408 shown in fig 1 a cover most regions of conus albeit they are relatively sparse in western us in addition the basins span a wide range of hydrologic climatic and land surface characteristics fig 1b shows the histogram of basins area which spans four orders of magnitude with a range of 67 10 329 k m 2 the climate in the basins as defined by the dryness index di ratio of mean annual potential evapotranspiration pet to mean annual precipitation p varies considerably from wet and humid di 0 2 to hyper arid di 3 see fig 1c in addition to the streamflow observations mopex dataset provides several climatic topographic and geomorphologic characteristics of basins table 1 lists basin characteristics and their notations used in this study for the purpose of investigating their control on dynamic complexity 3 methods let s consider an m dimensional dynamical system that is the system dynamics arise from a set of m variables this set is denoted by x k where k 1 2 m at any time t the system can be represented in the phase space by the m dimensional point 1 x t x 1 t x 2 t x m t note that we use uppercase letter x k to denote the entire time series of variable k lowercase letter x k t to denote a single observation of x k at time t and bold lowercase letter x t to denote a single observation in the phase space at time t in the case where only a single variable is observed e g x 1 the theory of time delay embedding takens 1981 see also packard et al 1980 demonstrates that the topological features of the system manifold in the phase space is preserved if the system is represented by the time series of variable x 1 and its values shifted by a fixed delay time τ for convenience we shall remove the subscript in x 1 hereafter since only a single variable is considered therefore at any time t the system is represented by the e dimensional point 2 x t x t x t τ x t 2 τ x t e 1 τ where e is the embedding dimension note that e is not necessarily equal to the true dimension of the system m also the delay time τ is a multiple of the sampling time step δ t thus the smallest value of τ is δ t in the present paper the observed variable x is streamflow whereas the remaining m 1 variables are unobserved these variables correspond to rainfall soil moisture air temperature etc therefore we consider hereafter the phase space representation given by equation 2 our two measures of dynamic complexity of hydrological basins are estimated from two methods generally categorized as nonlinear prediction methods essentially nonlinear prediction entails that there exists a function in the e dimensional phase space that describes the evolution of the system as follows 3 x t t f t x t where t is the prediction horizon i e how far ahead and f t is a function that maps the phase space representation of the system at time t to the future state at time t t it is possible that an approximation of the function f t can be computed from the samples to predict the future state of x t as follows 4 x t t f t x t the function f t is local i e depends on the location of x t in the phase space and nonlinear hence the name nonlinear prediction within the field of chaos theory several methods have been proposed to approximate f t here we consider two methods namely the simplex nonlinear prediction method sugihara may 1990 and the sequential locally weighted global linear maps s map sugihara 1994 by means of these methods two complexity measures can be identified one is a proxy of the system dimensionality i e active degrees of freedom and the other is an indicator of the strength of nonlinearity the two following subsections will briefly describe the two nonlinear prediction methods and the corresponding complexity indices 3 1 simplex method and identification of optimum embedding dimension as discussed above the objective of simplex method sugihara may 1990 is to approximate the function f t in equation 4 in doing so the simplex method starts by constructing the manifold in the phase space using equation 2 specifically the manifold is constructed using the trajectory of the e dimensional point x t for time series of length l an example of such a manifold is shown in fig 2 a which is constructed from streamflow observations at gauging station id 01560000 note that in this case the phase space is 3 dimensional e 3 if x l t is to be predicted the e dimensional point x l is located in the phase space and then its e 1 nearest neighbors are identified next the locations of the e 1 points on the phase space after t time steps are identified finally x l t is obtained by calculating a weighted average of these locations the weights are exponential based on the distances of nearest neighbors from the point x l the intuition here is that the future system state can be predicted from the behavior of past values that are similar to the current state with similarity being defined as closeness in the phase space the simplex method can be used to estimate an optimum embedding dimension hereafter referred to as e opt this is done by iteratively selecting an e value e 1 2 3 and using a subset of the observed time series to predict the remaining values for each e value the predicted and observed values are compared using correlation coefficient ρ the value of e that achieves best prediction maximum ρ is the optimum embedding dimension simply e opt is the dimension that effectively unfolds system dynamics in the phase space as it eliminates singularities and trajectory crossings it is therefore an indicator of the true system dimensionality m formally whitney embedding theorem whitney 1944 gives the following inequality e opt 2 m 1 this means that e opt provides an upper bound on the true system dimensionality however because the time series we use in this study are finite and not noise free e opt is only regarded to be proportional to m not a strict upper bound on m fig 2b shows prediction accuracy for a range of e values using the same streamflow time series in fig 2a in this case the optimum embedding dimension is 3 3 2 s map method and identification of nonlinearity index the essential idea of the s map method sugihara 1994 for the prediction of x t t is to utilize a regression function that maps the e 1 dimensional vector x t to the one dimensional point x t t i e r e 1 r 1 using the following equation 5 x t t k 1 e 1 c k x k t here x t is equivalent to the e dimensional point x t augmented by adding a constant term specifically x 1 t 1 and x k t for k 2 3 e 1 is equivalent to the point x t the coefficient values c k in equation 5 are estimated from the constructed phase space in particular if the phase space is constructed using a streamflow time series of length l and the streamflow x l t is to be predicted we can re write equation 5 in matrix format with a slight modification as follows 6 b n 1 a n e 1 c e 1 1 where 7 b w x t x l x t t 8 a w x t x l x t c in equation 6 is the vector of coefficients c k note that the number of rows in both a and b is denoted by n which is equal to the number of x t points that don t share coordinates with the point x l equation 6 is modified from equation 5 by introducing a weighting factor w this factor depends on the euclidean distances in the phase space x t x l and it is calculated as follows 9 w d e θ d d here d is the distance x t x l and d is the average of distances for all values of t the parameter θ takes values in the range 0 if the value of θ is zero w d 1 regardless of the distance in other words all points in the phase space are assigned equal weights this is equivalent to fitting a global linear map on all points x t in the phase space on the contrary if θ is large points in the neighborhood of x l i e smaller d are assigned larger weights and the weights decreases exponentially as a function of the distance put simply as θ takes larger values the function f t becomes more local and nonlinear an indicator of the system nonlinearity can be estimated using s map specifically successive values of θ starting from zero are chosen and prediction accuracy ρ for each value is calculated the value that maximizes prediction which is denoted here by θ opt is identified and considered to be a measure of the system nonlinearity values of θ opt near zero indicates that the behavior of the system is linear whereas larger values of θ opt means that more accurate prediction can be achieved by considering local neighborhood as opposed to the global phase space this latter case clearly indicates the existence of state dependent nonlinear behavior it should be noted that s map has previously been used to identify systems nonlinearity sugihara 1994 fig 2c shows prediction accuracy as a function of θ where the value of θ opt is 3 the fundamental interpretation of θ opt as a nonlinearity index is more precise than the general definition of nonlinear systems as systems in which output changes are not proportional to input changes nonlinearity in such a broad sense might stem from a variety of forms e g polynomials of degrees higher than one exponential etc however θ opt is closely tied to state dependent behavior essentially it is a parameter of equation 4 and it is obtained by optimizing the function in equation 4 to yield best predictions therefore a low value of θ opt e g θ opt 0 means that a single function of f t in equation 4 is valid to represent streamflow regardless of the basin dynamical state on the contrary a high value of θ opt indicate that f t is highly sensitive to the basin dynamical state 3 3 testing for statistical significance using surrogates in order to obtain confidence on the values of complexity indices and to ensure that the process is indeed a form of chaotic determinism we resort to the use of surrogates the essential idea of testing for statistical significance using surrogates is to first define a null hypothesis on the underlying process that generated the observed time series surrogates are then generated in accordance with the null hypothesis and a discriminating metric is computed from both the original time series and surrogates finally the null hypothesis is rejected if the value of the metric is different from its distribution in the surrogate time series a hierarchy of null hypotheses can be adopted for testing the significance of nonlinear dynamics the simplest of which is to assume that the observed time series is the result of independent and identically distributed i i d random variable however under many circumstances this hypothesis is insufficient and a stricter null hypothesis is required several methods have been proposed in the literature to generate surrogate data consistent with different null hypotheses e g kugiumtzis 2000 schreiber schmitz 1996 theiler et al 1992 here we use an algorithm that randomizes the phases of the fourier transform of the original timeseries and it preserves the mean variance and autocorrelation i e fourier spectrum this algorithm is described in theiler et al 1992 see also osborne et al 1986 essentially the original timeseries is transformed to the frequency domain then the phases at all frequencies are randomized in a symmetrical manner for positive and negative frequencies finally surrogate timeseries is obtained by transforming the phase randomized fourier spectrum back to the time domain see theiler et al 1992 for detailed description in the present study we generate 100 surrogates for each timeseries of streamflow throughout our analysis we compute any metric of interest for both the original timeseries and the 100 surrogates there are three metrics that are considered in this study 1 the accuracy of nonlinear prediction expressed as correlation coefficient ρ 2 the optimum embedding dimension e opt and 3 the optimum nonlinearity index θ opt let q denote any of these three metrics computed for the original timeseries whereas μ q and σ q are the mean and standard deviation of the metric computed from the 100 surrogates the statistical significance is then computed as follows 10 s q μ q σ q s indicates how distant the metric q is from μ q in terms of units of standard deviation σ q the distribution of q in the surrogates is assumed to be gaussian and a simple one sided p value can be computed to evaluate the statistical significance of any metric q 4 results and discussion 4 1 presence of chaotic dynamics simplex and s map methods were applied on each streamflow timeseries of the 413 mopex basins before we report the results on hydrologic complexity an analysis is conducted to examine the presence of chaotic behavior in each streamflow timeseries the analysis is performed by computing prediction accuracy ρ for both the original timeseries and surrogates the statistical significance is then computed according to section 3 3 a basin is considered to exhibit chaotic dynamics if the prediction accuracy of the original timeseries is greater than that of the surrogate distribution with a p value less than the statistical significance level α of 0 05 a statistically significant p value means that the phase space representation provides useful information for prediction beyond what is contained in the autocorrelation in other words there exists an underlying dynamical attractor with coherent structure such that it can be exploited to achieve better prediction on the contrary if the basin behavior is not controlled by chaotic dynamics the obtained prediction accuracy ρ of the original timeseries will be within the distribution of ρ in the surrogates this latter case will result in a high p value and the null hypothesis is accepted it is worth mentioning that this analysis is not a conclusive test for the presence of chaotic dynamics which as noted by porporato and ridolfi 1997 can only be achieved by applying a variety of techniques complementary to each other it is nonetheless useful to pinpoint the existence of a weakest component of chaotic dynamics and it allows us to account for autocorrelation effects in the timeseries it should also be noted that for the sake of comparison we computed lyapunov exponent jayawardena 2013 hegger et al 1999 for each hydrologic basin in order to assess the presence of chaos using other measures the results see supplementary material show that 95 2 of the basins that were identified as chaotic according to the simplex method also show a positive lyapunov exponent which indicates the presence of chaos fig 3 a shows a part of the 1 day ahead streamflow forecasts at usgs gauging station id 1631000 located in virginia we use 70 of the observations to construct the phase space and then validate the accuracy of nonlinear prediction in the remaining 30 of the record fig 3b shows the scatterplot of observed and forecasted streamflow with correlation coefficient ρ of 0 78 fig 3c shows the histogram of forecast accuracy obtained for the 100 surrogates their mean and standard deviation are 0 73 and 0 004 respectively by assuming a gaussian distribution with these values for mean and standard deviation shown in black in fig 3c a p value can be computed which in this case is equal to 3 10 36 therefore the basin is considered to exhibit chaotic behavior note that the difference in ρ between the surrogates and the original time series is not substantial mainly because of the high autocorrelation in daily streamflow at this basin thus if one is only interested in the practical aspect of forecasting a persistence model of streamflow krajewski et al 2020 ghimire and krajewski 2020 would yield comparable results to that of nonlinear prediction on the basis of the aforementioned analysis it was found that chaotic behavior exists at 268 basins of the 408 mopex basins note that only these basins will be considered for analysis in the remaining sections of this article it is interesting to examine whether the presence of chaotic dynamics can be explained in terms of basin characteristics by carefully examining all basin characteristics table 1 we found that psi and snowfraction exert first order control on the presence of chaotic behavior fig 4 presents a scatterplot of both chaotic and non chaotic basins and their variability in terms of psi and snowfraction most basins that have psi values 0 25 indicating more uniform rainfall throughout the year are chaotic moreover it appears that basins with snow fraction more than 0 4 are mostly non chaotic specifically 72 of the basins with psi 0 25 and snowfraction 0 4 are chaotic whereas 81 of the basins with greater than 0 4 of snowfraction are non chaotic this last observation is consistent with previous results reported by wilcox et al 1991 who examined a daily record of snowmelt runoff from a basin in southwestern idaho and they found no evidence of chaotic dynamics moreover the relationship between psi and presence of chaotic behavior seems to be in agreement with the work of sivakumar and singh 2012 although they did not examine explicitly the impact of psi on chaotic dynamics their analysis over the western us revealed that most sites with unidentifiable dimensionality i e no clear chaotic behavior are located in semi arid southwestern us southern california and arizona which have high rainfall seasonality i e large psi admittedly the distinction of chaotic dynamics based on these two characteristics while clear on the extremes is blurry for a range of psi and snowfraction values for instance there exists an overlap of chaotic and non chaotic basins for the region psi 0 25 and snowfraction 0 4 this is however expected since the interplay of a myriad of other factors could potentially affect the presence of nonlinear dynamics 4 2 hydrologic complexity and its variability simplex and s map were applied to the 268 basins that showed evidence of chaotic dynamics in order to estimate e opt values of e in the range 1 20 were iteratively selected to compute accuracy of prediction for a prediction horizon of 1 day t 1 as for the nonlinearity index θ opt θ was iteratively selected from the values 0 0 05 0 075 0 1 0 15 0 2 0 4 0 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 15 in order to obtain statistical confidence on the values of e opt and θ opt we computed their statistical significance according to the surrogate test in section 3 3 because we seek to identify low dimensional nonlinear chaotic behavior any given value of e opt is considered statistically significant if it is smaller than its surrogate distribution at a significance level of 0 05 conversely θ opt is considered statically significant if its value is larger than its surrogate distribution fig 5 shows the joint and marginal distributions of e opt and θ opt basins shown in dark blue are the ones where both complexity indices are statistically significant also the histograms in fig 5 show the marginal distribution of statistically significant e opt and θ opt the following observations may be made 1 there is a large variability in basin complexity with e opt and θ opt in the ranges 1 12 and 0 15 respectively 2 a tradeoff between e opt and θ opt exists consequently very few basins exhibit both high number of active degrees of freedom and extreme nonlinearity this is demonstrated by the negative slope of the joint density contour lines 3 the dynamics in a large number of basins has a small number of active degrees of freedom this can be seen from the positively skewed distribution of e opt with a median 4 black dashed line 4 similarly the distribution of θ opt is positively skewed with a long right tail and a median approximately equal to 4 suggesting that dynamics in most basins is moderately nonlinear and very few basins exhibit highly nonlinear dynamics it is noteworthy to point out that the way in which the two complexity indices were identified is analogous to bayesian statistics specifically we assumed non informative uniform prior distributions of e opt and θ opt with ranges 1 20 and 0 15 respectively consequently the histograms of marginal distributions shown in fig 5 can be viewed as the posterior distributions of e opt and θ opt it is also worth mentioning that previously reported results on dynamics dimensionality points to a similar distribution patterns to the ones observed here in particular vignesh et al 2015 who used false nearest neighbor approach to identify the dimensionality reported a positively skewed distribution for dimensionality of 639 basins in conus specifically 75 of the basins they analyzed had a dimension below or equal to 6 similar observations can be found in the work of sivakumar and singh 2012 in their analysis of 117 basins in western us taking into consideration that both studies used different techniques to examine system dimensionality and focused on monthly time scale unlike the present study this could potentially indicate that the results are independent of the time scale and the techniques used for analysis we also note that for the sake of comparison we utilized the false nearest neighbors fnn method to estimate the optimum embedding dimension jayawardena 2013 kennel et al 1992 the results see supplementary material show that the estimates obtained from fnn are within 2 for 80 of the basins which indicate that the results are not substantially different when other methods are used to identify the optimum embedding dimension 4 3 impact of basin characteristics on hydrologic complexity here we examine the impact of basin characteristics on the value of the two complexity indices e opt and θ opt the total number of basin characteristics is 15 listed in table 1 which includes topographic climatic and land surface properties table 2 shows the spearman correlation coefficient r s between each of the 15 basin characteristics and the two complexity indices only basins where both complexity indices are statistically significant were considered for this analysis clearly e opt is primarily related to topographic properties of the basin such as area elevation slope stream length and drainage density i e p value of r s 0 05 the most significant relationship is with basin area r s 0 33 which is shown in fig 6 a specifically basins with larger areas tend to have lower dimensionality i e low active degrees of freedom this can be attributed to the fact that large basins are more effective in filtering out the random behavior induced by basin heterogeneities and rainfall variability as a result multiple degrees of freedom are subdued and the dynamics reduce to very few dimensions this is also in agreement with previous findings that streamflow forecasting in larger basins is more accurate than in small basins parajka et al 2013 zalenski et al 2017 which might be attributed to the low number of active degrees of freedom in large basins in particular the smoothing effect of large basins has long been hypothesized as the reason of why hydrologic models tend to perform better in large basins e g nester et al 2011 however empirical observations that link the size of basin area to dynamics dimensionality remained to be elusive in most studies e g liu et al 1998 in addition to the impact of basin area on e opt there are also significant correlations with channel slope and stream length with r s values of 0 32 and 0 29 respectively see fig 6b and c the relationship regarding stream length can be viewed as a result of the strong covariance between stream length and basin area particularly larger basins will most likely be associated with longer stream length indeed the spearman correlation coefficient between basin area and stream length is 0 89 on the other hand the positive correlation between e opt and channel slope indicate that flashier basins have large dimensionality of dynamics in other words holding all other variables constant an increase in channel slope means that the runoff response to rainfall is more direct the basin is flashier and the dimensionality of dynamics is large if one is to relate high values of e opt to low performance of models then several studies have previously indicated that the difficulty of modelling catchments increases with flashiness e g lidén harlin 2000 yatheendradas et al 2008 although the flashiness was attributed to climate properties and not to channel slope it is noteworthy that pande and moayeri 2018 reported an opposite relationship that high slope is associated with lower complexity however they also highlighted that this relationship is only evident within a specific group of steep basins in their case study i e it is not a general pattern lastly e opt has significant correlations with elevation and drainage density d d these two relationships might be viewed as a result of covariation with basin area stream length and channel slope in particular elevation and channel slope are correlated with r s 0 62 d d on the other hand covaries with basin area as it is defined as the ratio of stream length to basin area moreover the positive correlation between d d and e opt can be interpreted based on the fact that d d is an indicator of the interaction between groundwater and surface water at the basin scale more specifically a higher value of d d indicates less permeability of the surface and flashier response of the basin thus increasing the dynamic dimensionality for instance le moine 2008 shows that there is a significant correlation between d d and high flows i e flashier response the upshot of the results regarding the impact of basin properties on e opt is that low dimensional dynamics are present in large basins that filter out and smooth heterogeneities whereas basins with higher slope smaller size and flashier behavior are governed by large degrees of freedom it is worth mentioning that the relationship with basin size was observed in the work of vignesh et al 2015 furthermore other studies that reported the presence of low dimensional chaotic dynamics in streamflow were mostly limited to large basins for instance the aosta valley basin with an area of 3313 k m 2 porporato ridolfi 1997 it is also important to note that there is a wide scatter in all relationships and the values of e opt are not fully explained by the size and slope of basins this is however expected since the dynamics dimensionality arises from the interplay of several factors and it is far more complex than to be explained by a single variable unlike e opt which is primarily modulated by topographic properties of the basin presence of nonlinearity indicated by the value of θ opt is only correlated at α 0 05 with the type of vegetation cover r s 0 27 fig 6d shows the relationship between the nonlinearity index θ opt and the dominating international geosphere biosphere programme igbp land cover class there are 17 igbp land cover classes shown in appendix ranging from evergreen forests classes 1 and 2 to built up land and water bodies classes 13 and 17 the igbp land cover in the basins used for the analysis in this section are almost limited to classes 1 through 13 the gradient of igbp classes from low class 1 to high class 13 represents the gradient in spatial and temporal extent of canopy cover from evergreen forests to built up lands therefore the negative correlation shown in fig 6d indicates that basins with no or very limited canopy cover i e classes 11 13 tend to behave more linearly whereas extensive vegetation is associated with more nonlinear dynamics it is plausible to interpret these results in terms of the complex impact of canopy cover on evapotranspiration infiltration and interception storage the nonlinearity indicated by the index θ opt is particularly related to state dependent behavior essentially a high value of θ opt indicates that the temporal evolution of streamflow is highly sensitive to the dynamical state of the basin in light of this fundamental understanding the relationship between θ opt and vegetation cover can be explained through the sponge effect hypothesis bruijnzeel 2004 generally this hypothesis highlights the nonlinear state dependent behavior of watersheds dominated by extensive vegetation cover i e forests and it postulates that the existence of forests reduces runoff peaks and annual runoff but it enhances infiltration leading to increased streamflow during the dry season there are several studies that examined this hypothesis ogden et al 2013 using a paired catchment methodology showed evidences of the sponge effect hypothesis the relationship with vegetation cover is also consistent with previous studies that linked higher basin complexity to vegetation with more storage capacity pande moayeri 2018 although that there is not an extensive literature on the explicit impact of vegetation cover on complexity of dynamics it appears to be intuitive that more vegetation cover aggravates the nonlinearity of basins through its complex impact on evapotranspiration infiltration and interception 4 4 hydrologic complexity and predictability how does hydrologic complexity as defined by e opt and θ opt relates to predictability of daily streamflow here we seek to shed light on this question which have important implications for modelling and prediction of streamflow by providing some preliminary observations since nonlinear prediction based on phase space reconstruction is completely model free and independent of structural assumptions the accuracy of nonlinear prediction is a function of the underlying dynamics and is often interpreted as a proxy of predictability therefore previous studies have utilized accuracy of nonlinear prediction and its decay with prediction horizon to distinguish noise from chaotic dynamics sugihara may 1990 tsonis elsner 1992 and examine lyapunov exponent farmer and sidorowich 1987 grassberger et al 1991 here we examine whether any clear patterns can be inferred if the predictions for basins are grouped based on the values of the two complexity measures fig 7 shows the accuracy of nonlinear streamflow forecasts for prediction horizons of 1 2 3 5 7 10 and 14 days as a function of e opt continuous lines in fig 7a and θ opt fig 7b in both figures three groups of e opt and θ opt termed low medium and high are identified and prediction accuracy is averaged for all basins within each group note that the grouping is based on equal counts interestingly there is a clear relationship between basin dimensionality e opt and prediction accuracy precisely prediction accuracy is higher for basins with low dimensionality and it decreases consistently for basins with higher dimensions this relationship is consistent for prediction horizons of 1 day up to 2 weeks on the other hand the reverse relationship can be observed between θ opt and prediction accuracy particularly prediction accuracy is higher for nonlinear basins and it decrease consistently for basins with more linearity in both cases the prediction decay rate appears to be independent of e opt and θ opt one might immediately tend to think that the observed impact of e opt on prediction accuracy reflects its dependence on basin area specifically as discussed in the previous subsection larger basins have lower dimensionality it is therefore plausible that larger basins have higher prediction accuracy due to their long memory autocorrelation it is noteworthy that increased streamflow prediction as a function of basin area was previously reported parajka et al 2013 viglione et al 2013 in order to test this hypothesis basins are classified into three equal counts groups of basin area low medium and high the results are shown as the dashed lines in fig 7a while it appears that this grouping based on basin area have some resemblance to the one based on e opt the distinction is not as sharp as the grouping based on e opt this preliminary observation is worthy of further examination and it is an indication that dynamic complexity as defined by e opt and θ opt provides insights on nonlinear phase space prediction accuracy beyond what is entailed by basin properties such as basin area 5 conclusions this study attempted to examine the qualitative character of watershed dynamics by applying techniques of chaotic dynamical systems namely phase space reconstruction and nonlinear prediction their main advantage is that they are nonparametric and data driven thus they are independent of structural assumptions in hydrologic models while previous studies that used techniques of chaotic dynamical systems interpreted dynamic complexity in terms of a single measure indicating system dimensionality we provided two measures of dynamic complexity the first measure e opt provides an estimation of system dimensionality i e number of active degrees of freedom whereas the second measure θ opt is a proxy for the strength of dynamics nonlinearity an analysis on 408 basins from the mopex dataset representing a wide range of climatic topographic and land surface characteristics was conducted and the main findings are as follows based on surrogate test to identify whether a component of deterministic chaos exists it was found that 268 of the 408 basins exhibit chaotic dynamics further investigation revealed that snow fraction and rainfall seasonality psi exert first order control on the presence of chaotic dynamics specifically rainfed i e low snow fraction basins with lower psi i e more uniform rainfall tend to exhibit chaotic behavior values of complexity measures for the 268 basins show a wide range of variability with e opt and θ opt in the range of 1 12 and 0 15 respectively however the distribution of both measures is positively skewed with 50 of basins having a value of e opt and θ opt below 4 this means that the dynamics in most basins is moderately nonlinear and have a low number of active degrees of freedom the dynamic dimensionality number of active degrees of freedom as estimated by e opt is found to be primarily related to basin area specifically larger basins tend to have lower dimensionality this is attributed to the impact of large basins in filtering out heterogeneities within the basin e opt is also positively correlated with channel slope indicating that flashier basins have large dimensionality unlike dynamic dimensionality the nonlinearity of dynamics is found to be regulated by the type of vegetation cover in the basin specifically basins with year round extensive vegetation cover are associated with nonlinear dynamics preliminary results show that grouping of basins in terms of the value of e opt and θ opt provides insights on prediction accuracy of daily streamflow for prediction horizons of 1 day up to 2 weeks in particular it is shown that low dimensional nonlinear dynamics lead to higher prediction accuracy generally the relatively large number of basins that were shown to exhibit chaotic dynamics based on the surrogate test corroborates previous assertions that hydrologic catchments are systems of organized complexity falling between the extremes of randomness and organized simplicity dooge 1986 regarding our findings on the impact of basin properties on complexity indices some comparisons can be inferred from previous studies that examined catchment similarity for instance it has been previously shown that basin size is strongly related to hydrologic model performance e g das et al 2008 hellebrand van den bos 2008 merz et al 2009 oudin et al 2008 zalenski et al 2017 although several arguments were put forward to explain this relationship it is most likely that the low dimensional dynamics of large basins lead to this relationship similarly the slope of catchments was previously shown to provide some control on classifying catchments into distinct groups in northeastern united states sawicz et al 2011 other studies highlighted that climate controls are significant in classification of basins in particular it is often found that modelling and prediction in arid catchments is more challenging than in humid catchments e g pande moayeri 2018 parajka et al 2013 most of these studies followed a line of reasoning that is based on prediction accuracy that is hydrologic models tend to perform poorly in arid catchments in the present study we did not observe significant correlations between climate properties and the two complexity indices however it should be noted that there exists a negative correlation significant at α 0 15 between the dryness of a catchment and the nonlinearity index see table 2 while this relationship seems to be contradictory to previously reported results we note that stronger nonlinearity should not be confused with poorer prediction accuracy in fact fig 7b shows that prediction accuracy is better for basins with higher values of θ opt it is also important to note that the conclusions drawn from this study should be viewed in the context of the assumptions implied in the nonlinear prediction methods namely simplex and s map the results might differ slightly if other assumptions are incorporated for instance pande and moayeri 2018 used the concept of difficult streamflow events in accordance with the assumption that complexity emerges from otherwise noisy background thus their complexity measure is significantly correlated with all hydroclimatic characteristics as it is with all data driven techniques the robustness of results is limited by the two factors sample length and the presence of observational noise the former is less likely to imperil the findings of the present paper because relatively large samples were used in the analysis specifically we only kept stations with streamflow record longer than 30 years of the remaining stations approximately 80 have record longer than 50 years this corresponds to sample length larger than 18 250 as for the presence of noise no attempts were made here to examine or remove noise from streamflow observations this is mainly because the observations are part of the hcdn dataset which has been subjected to quality control and it is widely used in hydrologic studies it is worth mentioning however that methods for noise reduction in chaotic dynamical analysis has previously been proposed e g jayawardena gurung 2000 another limitation of this study is that the temporal resolution of the data is limited to the daily scale observations at this time scale may average and obscure the dynamical response of the system especially for small basins ghimire et al 2020 the results presented here have implications and potential relevance to several applications as it provides a basis for catchment classification based on similarity of dynamic complexity this is particularly useful because the approach we used is data driven and it is not limited by our ability to represent and model hydrologic processes this property is often preferred in catchment classification systems beven 2011 wagener et al 2007 the findings that relate basin characteristics to the dynamic complexity measures presented in this study can be useful in obtaining a proxy for the complexity of system dynamics in ungauged basins consequently this allows making informative decisions regarding extrapolation of hydrologic model parameters to ungauged basins and selection of reference streamflow gauges archfield vogel 2010 arguably this is more advantageous compared to commonly used approaches of spatial proximity to extrapolate parameters to ungauged basins this can be demonstrated in fig 8 which shows the spatial distribution of the two complexity measures for all stations the values of e opt fig 8a are substantially heterogenous and the distribution of θ opt fig 8b albeit to some extent homogenous shows local variability these observations suggest that using spatial proximity for regionalization of model parameters is flawed because proximity does not reflect similarity of dynamic complexity moreover since the measures presented in this study estimate both dynamic dimensionality and nonlinearity separately they potentially have implications in model selection specifically to guide the selection of models with appropriate complexity both in terms of strength of nonlinearity and number of active degrees of freedom that is well suited to resolve watershed dynamics finally we also note that the results presented here may have implications and guide the application of data driven e g deep learning approaches to streamflow

4632,high temperature aquifer thermal energy storage ht ates is a promising option to compensate for the seasonal mismatch between heating supply and demand in the heating sector based on renewable energies to test and verify numerical and experimental methods for predicting ht ates thermo hydraulic impacts a small scale heat injection test with injection temperatures of 70 c was conducted in a shallow aquifer and monitored using a dense temperature sensor network prior to the heat injection test the hydraulic and thermal properties of the field site were investigated and a predictive high resolution numerical simulation model of the coupled thermo hydraulic processes was derived based only on this a priori information the comparison of measured and predicted temperature breakthrough curves showed a good correspondence suggesting that the model is able to predict the overall thermal behavior the model predictions were most accurate for long term and far field temperature evolution with lower accuracy for temperature peaks closer to the injection well density driven buoyancy flow was identified as an active heat transport process due to the relatively high vertical hydraulic conductivity the numerical model parameterized based only on a priori site investigation data is shown suitable for predicting heat transport processes due to a high temperature heat injection as well

sustainable development policies asif and muneer 2007 united nations 2015 the heating sector is crucial to this since it accounts for approximately 50 of global energy consumption ren21 2016 however a disadvantage of renewable heating sources is the seasonal mismatch between energy supply and demand to overcome this challenge underground thermal energy storage utes has attracted increasing attention novo et al 2010 sanner et al 2003 and could significantly contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions buscheck et al 2017 dinçer 2000 among the different utes technologies for seasonal heat storage aquifer thermal energy storage ates provides large storage capacities and high storage rates dinçer and rosen 2011 this technology is based on alternating injection and extraction of water via wells from and into an aquifer with heat stored in summer by injecting heated groundwater which is retrieved in winter by re extraction while most ates systems have relatively low injection temperatures fleuchaus et al 2018 high temperature ates ht ates using injection temperatures 50 c has a higher overall energy storage capacity than low temperature ates lt ates it can be combined with other renewable technologies e g solar biomass geothermal or industrial heat waste and the extracted hot water can be used for heating purposes without the need for additional heat pumps fleuchaus et al 2020 the suitability of ates systems depends on their economic viability and regulatory compliance therefore a detailed characterization of hydrogeological and physical parameters is essential especially for ht ates systems numerical modeling is required for designing such ates systems because of the structure of suitable geological aquifers and the feedback between flow and heat transport processes bloemendal et al 2018 kabuth et al 2017 it is also useful for evaluating the effects of ates on the subsurface if monitoring data is limited visser et al 2015 in ht ates free convection is induced by buoyancy flow from the density difference between the injected hot water and the aquifer water at ambient temperatures schout et al 2014 to correctly simulate the buoyancy flow intensity the heat transfer and groundwater flow processes have to be implemented in a coupled manner in numerical codes collignon et al 2020 kolditz et al 1998 and high spatial and temporal resolutions are required in regions of spatially and temporally steep hydraulic and thermal gradients therefore to accurately predict storage capacities rates and losses bauer et al 2017 and the effects from heat loss and changes of the hydraulic regime the governing hydraulic and thermal processes have to be understood for a range of geological settings and under different operational schemes e g injection temperature flow rates etc specifically the long term impacts of ht ates must be reliably quantifiable bauer et al 2013 for subsurface planning and to identify the potential geochemical effects induced by ht ates plants to achieve this experimental and numerical methods must be developed and verified that due to the complexity of geological aquifers require dedicated and well monitored field experiments heat injection tests can be used to investigate thermal and hydraulic processes and impacts the injection of hot water into an aquifer with no extraction enables the intact propagation of the thermal signal and observation of the subsequent cooling of the produced heat plume palmer et al 1992 conducted a heat injection test at 35 c in a shallow unconfined aquifer and monitored the resulting temperature distribution with high spatial resolution the investigated processes and the experiment were successfully simulated by molson et al 1992 a similar experiment with subsequent numerical simulations at an injection temperature of 48 c was performed by vandenbohede et al 2011 in a shallow unconfined aquifer their study focused on parameter identification and reliability and showed that parameters controlling conductive transport are more reliably derived than parameters determining convective transport wagner et al 2014 conducted a heat injection test with an injection temperature of 22 c into an unconfined shallow alluvial aquifer this enabled the layering of the aquifer to be inferred and the identification of flow along preferential flow paths wildemeersch et al 2014 conducted a combined heat and tracer experiment in an alluvial aquifer with an injection temperature of 40 c that enabled the determination of heat transfer parameters from the breakthrough curves at the recovery well under forced gradient dipole conditions klepikova et al 2016 used inverse modeling from the additional use of temperatures measured at observation wells installed at the same field site to infer preferential flow paths doro et al 2015 investigated forced gradient dipole heat injection tests with injection temperatures of 25 c they applied thermal tracer tomography to characterize the heterogeneity of the shallow alluvial aquifer and observed a strong dampening of temperature signals close to the injection well due to high heat diffusivity this could be alleviated by increased injection temperatures or prolonged injection however higher injection temperatures increase process complexity because fluid density and viscosity is temperature dependent to the best of our knowledge there have been no investigations using a high temperature heat injection test in a shallow subsurface aquifer the monitoring of the long term impacts and the reliability of numerical predictions of thermal impacts for such a test have not been demonstrated in contrast to heat injection experiments ates experiments have been performed with high injection temperatures for example molz et al 1978 1981 1983 performed a series of ht ates field tests with injection temperatures of up to 81 c in a sedimentary aquifer these studies demonstrated the technical feasibility of ht ates and provided data for the testing and development of numerical models some of these experiments have been numerically simulated with good agreement between measured and simulated data for the extraction temperatures buscheck et al 1983 tsang et al 1982 temperature at observation wells ganguly et al 2017 or both papadopulos and larson 1978 sykes et al 1982 parr et al 1983 determined field site parameters by applying classical field investigation methods e g pumping tests and the line source method that were then used in subsequent modeling similarly taddia et al 2016 examined a glaciofluvial unconfined aquifer in order to install an open loop groundwater heat pump system they focused on the evaluation of a pumping test arguing that parameters influencing advective heat transport such as the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity can thus be determined miller and delin 2002 and delin et al 2002 reported a series of ht ates field experiments with injection temperatures of 88 c to 118 c in cambrian sandstone aquifers at depths between 180 m and 240 m and carried out numerical simulations of these experiments however none of these experimental and numerical studies have identified whether traditional field investigation methods are sufficient for realistic predictive numerical simulations of ht ates nor which parameters are most important this paper therefore examines whether the determination of thermal and hydraulic parameters using standard field investigation methods is sufficiently reliable for predicting transient temperature distribution and the coupled thermo hydraulic effects induced by a high temperature heat injection to achieve this a small scale heat injection test using a well doublet in a shallow sandy aquifer was performed with injection temperatures 70 c prior to the heat injection test the aquifer was characterized by hydrogeological methods and a predictive simulation was performed using high resolution numerical process modeling of the field injection test based on the a priori information the predicted temperature distribution was then compared to the measured temperatures for verification of the process understanding and the applied numerical and site investigation methods 2 heat injection test 2 1 field site the experimental field site was approximately 100 km north of berlin near the town of wittstock dosse brandenburg northern germany on a former military airfield fig 1 c the test site was approximately 50 m 40 m with a maximum difference in ground elevation of 0 45 m the field site is operated by kiel university and the helmholtz centre for environmental research ufz and has been used to study induced impacts and monitoring methods for co2 gas injection lamert et al 2012 peter et al 2013 2012 schulz et al 2012 the field site has been extended and is currently used to investigate the effects of high temperature heat storage and leakage from gas storage within the testum aquifer project hornbruch et al in prep the regional geology consists of glacial and glacio fluvial sediments of quaternary age from the saale and vistula glacial stages see also peter et al 2012 the local geological structure was derived using core samples and the results from hydraulic profiling tool hpt logs geoprobe systems 2013 mccall and christy 2020 hpt logs are based on the depth dependent ratio of the injected water flow rate to the corresponding pressure response corrected by the atmospheric and piezometric pressure q pc ml min kpa fig 2 the higher the ratio the higher the relative hydraulic conductivity of the sediment three examples of these profiles are shown in fig 2 the geological profiles of the wells w2 4z c00 and mp001 are based on the in situ evaluation of the drilled material while for the injection well the material was repacked and transported to the laboratory for detailed characterization the hpt logs correspond well to the geological profiles indicating the presence of a highly permeable unsaturated layer from the ground surface to approximately 3 m below ground level 1 1 all depth information in this article is below ground level followed by a low hydraulic conductivity layer to approximately 6 m and a more permeable layer down to 15 m depth that was the aquifer used as the injection horizon for the heat injection test the aquifer is underlain by a low hydraulic conductivity glacial till layer these profiles were also identified in the geological profiles especially the clayey and silty section with intersecting sandy parts between 3 m and 6 m and the primarily sandy materials of the aquifer the measured groundwater heads were at approximately 3 3 m indicating that the aquifer is confined and the uppermost permeable layer forms the unsaturated zone while the evaluation of pumping tests section 3 3 suggests that the low hydraulic conductivity unit above the saturated aquifer acts as an aquiclude based on the hpt and sedimentological data this unit is interpreted as an aquitard the permeable layer beneath the aquifer below about 15 m depth is characterized as silty fine sand at mp001 silty fine sand to clayey silt at the injection well and as gravelly silt at w2 4z c00 the geological layering is found consistently throughout the field site and there is no significant variation in grain size in the layers between the boreholes in the area of influence of the heat injection test therefore a simplified geological interpretation of an unsaturated zone ground level to 3 m upper aquitard 3 m to 6 m aquifer 6 m to 15 m and lower aquitard 15 m to 20 m is used in this work this is consistent with the geological layering identified by peter et al 2012 the local groundwater flow direction as inferred from interpolation of the groundwater level measurements from august 2019 is from east northeast to west southwest with a mean hydraulic gradient of 0 0011 this is aligned with the regional flow direction towards the river dosse situated approximately 800 m west that acts as a discharge zone both the gradient and direction are consistent with values reported by peter et al 2012 2 2 technical setup one injection well one extraction well and 17 observation wells were installed fig 1 and equipped for the heat injection test during the site set up phase in 2018 sonic drilling was used this requires no annular space filling because the wells are directly inserted into the collapsing borehole it also enables taking liners at drilling locations and the application of technologies for hydrogeologic characterization if used separately from drilling two types of wells were used two inch wells and continuous multichannel tubing system wells cmt solinst georgetown canada referred to here as multilevel wells fig 1b the two inch observation wells were screened in three screen center depths 7 5 m 10 5 m 13 5 m to four 7 5 m 9 5 m 11 5 m 13 5 m sections each 1 m long within the aquifer which allowed for vertically oriented pumping and pressure monitoring during pumping tests the multilevel observation wells were screened at four to five depths some at 5 0 m all at 7 5 m 10 5 m 13 5 m 17 0 m with a screen length of 5 cm 10 cm which allowed for low flow and low volume groundwater sampling at specific and well defined depths the injection and the extraction well were two inch wells fully screened from 7 m to 14 m i e in the confined aquifer the extraction well was placed 40 m upstream from the injection well water was extracted from the aquifer during heat injection through the extraction well and pumped into a cold water storage tank from there the water passed through a plate heat exchanger where it was heated to the desired temperature 74 c passed into a hot water tank and gravitationally reinjected into the aquifer at the injection well an oil fired boiler provided the heating the water flowed through a one inch pipe installed inside the injection well to the well bottom from where it flowed back through the well screen to the aquifer this installation prohibits density driven buoyancy flow of the hot water in the upper part of the injection well which would result in preferential heat injection at the top of the aquifer both the flow rate and the temperature of the injected water were measured continuously at the wellhead of the injection well proline promag p 300 flowmeter and easytemp tmr31 sensor endress hauser gmbh co kg weil am rhein germany no flow rate measurements were taken at the extraction well because the extraction rate was on average equal to the injection rate for monitoring temperature distribution in the subsurface 17 observation wells and the injection well were equipped with thermocouple sensors type t labfacility ltd bognor regis united kingdom and type t class 1 omega engineering gmbh deckenpfronn germany with a resolution of 1 c temperature was measured at 1 m 2 m 4 m 5 m 6 5 m 7 5 m 9 m 10 5 m 13 5 m and 16 5 m yielding a higher vertical resolution at the aquifer top the sensors were attached to the outside of the tubing during installation of the wells and were connected to a central logging unit with cables 30 cm deep in the ground of the 180 installed thermocouples 11 failed up until november 2019 and several time gaps in the temperature measurements occurred due to technical problems the measuring interval was successively increased from 1 min at the start of the experiment in may 2019 to 20 min from july 2019 onwards eight solinst levelogger 3001 pressure loggers solinst canada ltd georgetown canada recorded pressure in the two inch wells nmr01 nmr02 nmr03 nmr04 w2 2z c10 w2 2z d09 w2 2z u07 and w2 2z u15 fig 1 furthermore three moisture sensors smt 100 umwelt geräte technik gmbh müncheberg germany were installed just outside wells w2 ml u14 1 m depth and w2 ml d01 1 m and 7 5 m depth to monitor potential gas phase formation from degassing of the hot injected water the temperature sensors and pressure loggers fig 1a were positioned before the heat injection test based on the numerical simulations the monitoring locations with a similar distance to the injection well can be divided into three groups circle inside ci circle middle cm and circle outside co that had a radius of 1 2 m 3 1 m and 6 5 m around the injection well respectively fig 1a due to space restrictions at the field site the monitoring locations were not situated exactly on these circles and thus had slightly different distances to the injection well the transect flow direction fd was defined to monitor temperature distributions along the direction of natural groundwater flow the names of the wells are indicative of their position relative to the injection well with d designating downstream u upstream and c to the side of the injection well 2 3 heat injection the heat injection test was performed in may 2019 over seven days with the actual injection time being approximately 4 5 days fig 3 shows the flow rate and temperature of the injected water during the first seven days injection of water into the aquifer started at 19 20 on 23rd may 2019 with an injection of unheated water for 85 min using a flow rate of approximately 14 l min 0 84 m3 h at 20 45 the heater was switched on and the temperature of the injected water increased to 74 c within 45 min see fig 3 inertia effects in the heater control system caused variations in injection temperature of 1 5 c during the phase of relatively constant injection and in the injection flow rate of 0 2 l min after approximately three days of continuous injection the injection flow rate started to decline at first slowly and then more rapidly on days four and five hot water injection was therefore stopped at 05 42 on 28th may when achievable flow rates dropped to 1 l min a second injection phase was initiated on 29th may in an attempt to reactivate the heat injection but was stopped after 5 5 h due to the low achievable rate in total 85 74 m3 of water and 6437 kwh of heat were injected during both phases of which the second injection contributed only 3 13 during the active operation time of 110 47 h the average injection flow rate was 12 93 l min and the average injection temperature 73 76 c the observed decline in achievable injection flow rate could have been caused by well clogging from mineral precipitation griffioen and appelo 1993 willemsen 1990 fine particle transport andersson 1990 molz et al 1981 or reduced injectivity because of gas phase formation in the aquifer close to the injection well jenne et al 1992 lüders et al 2016 microscopic investigations following the heat injection test did not detect biomass in the injection well thus clogging due to mineral precipitation had probably occurred in the aquifer close to the injection well temperatures were measured prior to the experiment at all available locations as described above they are reported here for the first four months after the injection 3 numerical simulation a 3d numerical coupled groundwater flow and heat transport model for the heat injection test was constructed using the opengeosys ogs code ogs is a scientific open source finite element simulator especially developed and designed to simulate coupled processes in the subsurface kolditz et al 2012a kolditz and bauer 2004 it has been used in a number of studies on thermal and thermo hydraulic coupled problems in the context of geothermal engineering and subsurface energy use and is suitable for a range of thermal applications i e geothermal heat storage boockmeyer and bauer 2014 kastner et al 2017 popp et al 2015 deep geothermal energy extraction wang and bauer 2016 and groundwater flow and transport simulations ogs is especially suitable for variable density flow diersch and kolditz 2002 and has been well validated and documented kolditz et al 2018 2015 2012b 3 1 governing equations the governing equations describing the processes implemented in ogs are presented below the groundwater flow equation for a fully saturated porous medium in a pressure based formulation from bear and bachmat 1990 can be written as 3 1 s 0 p w t k μ w t p w ρ w t g q w where s0 1 pa is the storage coefficient pw pa is water pressure t s is time ρw t kg m3 is temperature dependent water density t k is temperature µw t pas is temperature dependent dynamic viscosity of water k m2 is the intrinsic permeability tensor g m s2 is the vector of gravitational acceleration and qw 1 s is the water source sink term as ρw t is lower for higher temperatures in the temperature range of 9 c to 78 c considered here warmer water tends to flow upwards due to buoyancy driven flow collignon et al 2020 also µw t is lower for higher temperatures resulting in a reduced resistance to groundwater flow and thus a higher water flow velocity and reduced pressure gradients due to the injection hydraulic conductivity k is assumed anisotropic with anisotropy described by the anisotropy factor i e the ratio of horizontal to vertical hydraulic conductivity kh kv the heat transport equation includes both convection and conduction processes bear and bachmat 1990 3 2 c ρ t t t n c w ρ w t v t d h t q t where c and cw j kg k are the specific heat capacities of the porous medium and of water respectively ρ t kg m3 is the temperature dependent density of the porous medium thus the volumetric heat capacities of the porous medium cρ t and of the water phase cwρw t are also considered temperature dependent v m s is the water flow velocity vector n is porosity dh w m k is the heat conduction dispersion tensor and qt j m3 s is the heat source sink term the volumetric heat capacity of the saturated porous medium cρ j m3 k is calculated as 3 3 c ρ t c s ρ s 1 n c w ρ w t n where cs j kg k is the specific heat capacity of the solid phase and ρs kg m3 is the density of the solid phase the heat diffusion dispersion tensor in eq 3 2 is given by 3 4 d h n λ w 1 n λ s n c w ρ w β t v δ i j β l β t v i v j v where λw and λs w m k are the thermal conductivities of the water and the solid phase respectively βl and βt m are the longitudinal and the transverse dispersivity respectively vi and vj m s are the i and j components of the fluid velocity respectively with i j x y z and δij is the kronecker delta since the effects of density have to be considered collignon et al 2020 an iterative coupling scheme was applied to solve the heat transport and groundwater flow equations boockmeyer and bauer 2014 wang and bauer 2016 3 2 model setup the numerical model was 300 m 150 m 20 m fig 4 which was shown by field site test simulations to be sufficiently large to minimize boundary effects on water flow and heat transport the injection well was located laterally in the center of the model and the model top was at the average land surface the model area and mesh were oriented with the longer axis parallel to the natural groundwater flow direction the finite element mesh consisted of 195 129 nodes with the elements increasing from 1 5 cm at the injection well to 15 m at the model boundaries utilizing the flexible unstructured grid options available in ogs the maximum element size within the area depicted in fig 1a i e where experimental data were available was 1 4 m the model represents the vertical geological structure as shown in fig 2 vertically the mesh consisted of 98 layers with a thickness of either 0 125 m or 0 25 m where the refinements are placed at the top and the bottom of the aquifer the computational mesh is thus refined at those locations where the maximum temperature and pressure gradients occur in order to ensure numerical accuracy and stability the numerical model grid was tested for grid convergence by increasing and decreasing the horizontal and vertical grid resolution by a factor of two during coarsening and refining the maximum differences in simulated temperatures were less than 0 20 c and 0 10 c respectively which is below the measurement accuracy of the field thermocouples in tests of time step length maximum deviations of less than 0 20 c and 0 10 c were found when increasing and decreasing the time step by a factor of two respectively thus temporal and spatial discretion were sufficient the initial temperature distribution in the model was interpolated from the vertical temperature profiles measured at the monitoring locations and the daily average of the atmospheric temperature for 23rd may 2019 i e the first day of the simulation as all monitoring locations near the injection well showed the same vertical temperature profile this temperature profile was interpolated over the whole model area assuming there were no horizontal variations the average temperature in the aquifer was 9 21 c this increased to approximately 14 c at the surface because of the seasonal rise in near surface temperatures in spring and summer a time variant dirichlet boundary condition prescribed temperature was assigned at the top of the model domain using time series of the atmospheric temperature measured at a climate station of deutscher wetterdienst dwd 1 12 km from the test site which were averaged on the simulation time steps the assignment of atmospheric temperature as a boundary condition is a simplification the ground surface temperature may deviate from the air temperature e g visser et al 2015 mann and schmidt 2003 but this approach was justified since good agreement between measured and simulated temperature profiles was observed before during and after the heat injection at locations near and far from the injection well the 6 m vertical distance between the ground surface and the top of the storage formation together with the parameters determined for the upper aquitard sufficiently reduced the short term temperature fluctuations to justify the chosen boundary condition at the bottom the temperature was fixed at 9 43 c which corresponds to the initial measured temperature it is assumed that this temperature did not change during the experiment as this boundary is 5 m below the aquifer used for heat injection and the estimated diffusive time scale is approximately nine months inflowing water at the vertical inflow faces of the aquifer layer was set to the initial water temperature while a zero temperature gradient boundary condition was applied at the outflow faces to allow for possible heat loss by advective heat transfer the initial pressure distribution is temperature dependent because of the temperature dependent water density used in the model see section 3 3 for specific density values therefore the initial pressure distribution has to account for the initial temperature distribution derived from the measurements a spin up simulation is required to get consistent sets of initial pressure and temperature ambient natural groundwater flow in the aquifer is accounted for by superposition of the initial vertical pressure distribution with the gradient of the groundwater level derived from piezometric head measurements see above at the vertical model faces this initial pressure distribution is prescribed as a dirichlet boundary condition thus inducing the ambient natural groundwater flow no flow boundary conditions are set at the top and bottom model faces the injection and extraction well were simulated by specifying water flow rates and injection temperature for the mesh nodes in the aquifer layer between 7 m and 14 m depth along a vertical line at the respective well positions injection and extraction rates were given as a function over time by applying the measured injection flow rate fig 3 for both the injection and extraction well as neumann boundary conditions thus maintaining the water balance of the aquifer the injection temperature fig 3 was assigned to the well nodes of the injection well as a dirichlet boundary condition while at the extraction well the temperature was calculated by the model the flow rate and injection temperature were measured with a temporal resolution of 1 min therefore values were averaged for the simulation time step an automatic time stepping scheme was applied with the maximum time step limited to 1 h during the first injection phase and to 5 min during the second injection phase as both injection flow rate and temperature strongly fluctuate over this period the maximum allowed time step gradually increases from 6 h to 10 days after the end of injection 3 3 model parameterization a set of hydraulic and thermal investigation methods was used to parameterize the numerical model according to the four geological layers shown in fig 2 table 1 summarizes the results for the aquifer layer and table 2 summarizes the results for the unsaturated zone and the confining layers for estimating hydraulic conductivity pumping tests and sieve curve analysis permeameter tests of repacked sediment material from liners and slug tests were performed pumping tests were also used to obtain estimates of the anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity and of the specific storage the pumping tests were carried out at the two inch well nmr04 in three different screened sections at 9 m to 10 m 11 m to 12 m and 13 m to 14 m nmr04 was chosen because it is only 2 5 m from the injection well and has the three screen sections required for estimating the anisotropy ratio the injection well is fully screened and thus not suitable the duration of pumping varied from 5 min to 10 min with pumping rates of 4 9 l min to 5 8 l min the induced transient pressure signal was observed in three depths at the three observation wells w2 2z d09 w2 2z u01 and w2 2z u07 which are representative for the heat site providing a total of 27 drawdown curves i e nine drawdown curves for each pumping test at a specific screen depth one solinst levelogger 3001 solinst canada ltd georgetown canada was placed in each screen section separated by a purpose built multi packer system to hydraulically insulate the different screen sections the measured pressure responses were evaluated using aqtesolv pro v4 5 software duffield 2007 each drawdown curve was evaluated separately for the determination of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and specific storage while the three drawdown curves for one well were fitted simultaneously for the estimation of the anisotropy ratio the analytical solution of dougherty and babu 1984 for a confined aquifer was applied this is based on theis 1935 and hantush 1961a 1961b and is applicable for pumping tests in multiple partially penetrating wells and accounts for both wellbore storage and wellbore skin effects since the pumping well has a small well casing radius of 0 025 m the well storage effect can be neglected while the wellbore skin factor was obtained during the evaluation the good data fits obtained from the selected analytical solution show that the confining unit acts as an aquiclude or low conductivity aquitard and that no recharge sources are present which agrees with the field investigations as described above the hydraulic conductivity of the injection aquifer only showed slight variation at the field site between 2 24 10 4 m s and 3 79 10 4 m s for the individual curves with an average of 3 19 10 4 m s the anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity was estimated between 2 37 and 2 40 for the three observation wells with an average of 2 39 which was used in the model for parameterizing the anisotropy factor specific storage values ranged from 1 26 10 05 1 m to 8 62 10 05 1 m with an average of 3 39 10 05 1 m grain size distributions were obtained by sieving and elutriation of aquifer material samples taken from the field hydraulic conductivity values were estimated using empirical correlations from hazen 1892 beyer 1964 kaubisch 1986 and seiler 1973 values varied from 3 00 10 5 m s to 5 16 10 4 m s with an average of 2 29 10 4 m s this is in good agreement with the pumping test results but with a wider range due to the smaller sample size permeameter tests were conducted using sieved and repacked aquifer material noethen 2018 and yielded much lower hydraulic conductivities than the two methods above probably due to the repacking and compacting required for these experiments these values were therefore disregarded after identification of hydrostratigraphic units using direct push hpt logging butler et al 2002 slug tests were carried out at mp002 within the aquifer hydraulic conductivities of 7 15 10 4 m s and 7 04 10 4 m s were derived with an average of 7 10 10 4 m s due to the small scale nature of the measurement these values cannot be considered as representative of the whole aquifer and are consequently not used for model parameterization overall the estimated hydraulic conductivity ranged from 3 0 10 05 m s to 7 15 10 04 m s table 1 the average from the pumping test data was 3 19 10 04 m s this value was used for model parameterization because the multi level pumping tests provide an estimate of the hydraulic conductivity at the relevant field scale i e at the scale of the heat injection test as well as providing consistent estimates for specific storage and the anisotropy ratio the estimates of hydraulic conductivity from the laboratory measurements are inferred from small and therefore less representative volumes of aquifer material removed from in situ conditions furthermore the pore network in the field is altered due to liner sampling repacking and possible drying effects previous studies have shown that the hydraulic conductivity estimate from pumping tests is typically higher than that derived from grain size analysis berg and illman 2011 hu 2011 as flow may circumvent zones of low hydraulic conductivity however all measurements indicated similar hydraulic conductivity supporting the findings of reasonable homogeneity from the field investigations the average hydraulic conductivity and specific storage values were recalculated to the required units as indicated in eq 3 1 and used for parameterization of the homogeneous flow and heat transport model total porosity was determined by measuring bulk and rock density and had a wide range from 0 29 to 0 47 the porosity value of 0 4 measured by harder 2019 is considered an outlier as it is much higher than the values measured by noethen 2018 and peter et al 2012 for the same site and hölting and coldewey 2013 for similar sediments the values reported by peter et al 2012 range from 0 30 to 0 34 for sandy materials which are consistent with the new measurements of the aquifer materials small scale in situ measurements of soil moisture smt 100 umwelt geräte technik gmbh müncheberg germany at well w2 ml d01 in the saturated aquifer gave a porosity value of approximately 0 36 which fits well with the range from other methods therefore in the model a porosity of 0 34 was used as an average and representative value based on the measurement of hydraulic conductivity and porosity and applying the average hydraulic gradient of 0 0011 obtained from piezometric head measurements on site the groundwater flow velocity was 0 09 m d peter et al 2012 reported slightly lower groundwater flow velocities varying from 0 05 m d to 0 07 m d derived from a salt tracer test tens of meters from the heat injection location as an average of these possible flow velocities 0 07 m d was used in the predictive model both longitudinal and transverse dispersivity is required for the numerical model no values were determined for the field site specifically as no direct field measurement method is available thus a value of 0 1 m each was applied this value allows for a numerically stable simulation while minimizing numerical dispersion thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity were measured using a kd2 pro thermal properties analyzer decagon devices inc pullman usa and a representative set of aquifer materials fifteen measurements were performed on water saturated sediments still enclosed in the liners as obtained from the field site bulk thermal conductivity varied from 2 55 w m k to 3 40 w m k similar to the range reported by otto 2012 of 2 40 w m k to 3 20 w m k for saturated sandy sediments in northern germany no obvious correlation to the sedimentology of the samples was found so no spatial distribution could be derived due to the rather small overall variability a thermal conductivity of 3 00 w m k was assigned to the model representing the mean value of all measurements bulk volumetric heat capacity ranged from 1 94 mj m3 k to 3 26 mj m3 k with an overall average of 2 70 mj m3 k as for thermal conductivity this average was used as a homogeneous value in the model temperature dependent correlations for the density and dynamic viscosity of water are required for the parameterization of the water phase empirical functions supplied by the physikalisch technische bundesanstalt ptb 1994 for water density and by yaws 1995 for dynamic viscosity were used for the unsaturated zone and both aquitards no hydraulic parameters were determined only very low hydraulic conductivity is expected for the aquitards as the pumping test evaluation gave no indication of a leaky aquitard layer therefore there are no significant hydraulic effects from the upper unsaturated zone so it was not investigated for this reason groundwater flow is omitted in these layers field scale thermal parameters were estimated for the unsaturated zone and the upper aquitard using a 1d purely diffusive heat transport model this model simulated the natural seasonal temperature variability for six months prior to the heat injection test by applying the measured surface temperature as a boundary condition and fitting the simulated temperature profiles to the measured temperature profiles this approach has been applied on a larger scale to investigate subsurface heat flow and temperature distributions bayer et al 2016 the volumetric heat capacity and the thermal conductivity were 1 6 mj m3 k and 2 0 mj m3 k and 1 9 w m k and 2 4 w m k for the unsaturated zone and the upper aquitard respectively table 2 these values are within the ranges for corresponding sediments of 1 6 mj m3 k to 2 2 mj m3 k and 1 0 w m k to 1 9 w m k for the unsaturated zone and of 1 5 mj m3 k to 2 5 mj m3 k and 1 1 w m k to 2 9 w m k for the upper aquitard verein deutscher ingenieure 2010 this inverse method has the advantage of yielding heat transport parameters at the field scale and is therefore not influenced by e g liner retrieval or repacking this method could not be used for the aquifer and the lower aquitard as no discernible seasonal temperature variations occur at this depth and the assumption of purely conductive heat transport does not hold in the aquifer as no sediment material was available for the lower aquitard the thermal parameters were assumed to be equal to those of the upper aquitard 4 results 4 1 isothermal hydraulics the model was tested before simulating the transient heat injection test using the isothermal multi level pumping tests at the three depths at well nmr04 prior to heat injection these pumping tests were also used to estimate the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and the anisotropy factor as well as the specific storage at the spatial scale of the field site see section 3 the measured pumping rates were applied as neumann boundary conditions to the corresponding screen sections of nmr04 and an isothermal transient simulation of groundwater flow was performed to obtain simulated drawdowns at the observation points fig 5 compares the simulated results and measured drawdown curves from pumping tests 9 m to 10 m at observation well w2 2z u01 in general a good correspondence of the measured and simulated curves was found as the model reproduces the maximum drawdown and the time behavior of the three drawdown curves the model also correctly distinguishes between the large depth at 13 5 m where drawdown is smaller and the shallower depths at 7 5 m and 10 5 m which exhibit nearly identical drawdown curves these different drawdowns are the result of aquifer anisotropy and the screen depth of the pumped section simulated drawdown deviates from the measured drawdown during early recovery after switching off the pump after 5 5 min but after 8 min it corresponds well this is due to backflow of water into the well from the pipe leading from the pump to the surface after the pump is switched off which increases the water level in the pumping well analogous to a small slug test and faster than from backflow from the aquifer only this effect is clearly seen for 1 min during which this backflow occurs while after this 1 min the natural groundwater flow dominates again and is well captured by the model the simulated drawdown in all sections at the end of the pumping period is slightly lower than the measured drawdown and is slightly more pronounced at the depth of 13 5 m the agreement between measured and simulated data shown in fig 5 is representative for all observation wells of this pumping test and also for the pumping tests conducted in the other screen sections of well nmr04 the effect of measured drawdown being slightly higher than modeled drawdown at the end of the pumping period indicates a local hydraulic conductivity reduction in the aquifer section close to well nmr04 the low deviation shows that the aquifer is only slightly heterogeneous as clear from the range of hydraulic conductivities reported in table 1 capturing these small variations in a numerical model would require very detailed and small scale experimental characterization of the 3d heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity for the field site i e multiple pumping tests at varying depths the aquifer is parameterized using homogeneous and anisotropic hydraulic conductivity due to the low variation in hydraulic conductivity and anisotropy factors in the pumping tests the ability of the numerical model to simulate the measured drawdown curves with good overall agreement shows that aquifer parameterization in terms of hydraulic conductivity anisotropy ratio specific storage hydrogeologic setup and the applied boundary conditions are adequate for simulating the induced isothermal groundwater flow in the aquifer at the field site 4 2 heat injection test the heat injection test was simulated by applying the well flow rate and injection temperature as shown in fig 3 and performing a transient non isothermal coupled simulation of groundwater flow and heat transport as outlined in section 3 1 and parameterized as shown in section 3 the model was used to predict subsurface temperatures and the heat transport processes induced by the heat injection fig 6 displays the simulated temperatures at five specific times 29th and 31st may 5th and 19th june and 7th july each at 7 pm after the end of heat injection using both a horizontal plane and a vertical transect through the model area fig 6 is used to illustrate the general behavior while figs 7 9 show a detailed comparison of measured temperatures and temperatures predicted by the numerical model the horizontal transects taken at 7 5 m from the top of the aquifer show that the heat in the aquifer at the end of the injection is distributed radially around the injection well fig 6a heat transport is dominated by advection due to the water injection superseding transport by the natural groundwater flow due to the low natural flow velocities simulated temperatures 60 c are restricted to a distance of 1 51 m from the injection well and temperatures 40 c to 2 58 m the 11 c temperature isoline indicating a temperature increase of 1 8 c above the initial aquifer temperature well above the 1 c measurement accuracy is at a distance of approximately 4 50 m from the injection well at 7 5 m depth the vertical transect at the end of heat injection shows high simulated temperatures 60 c close to the injection well at a distance of 0 19 m at all depths for distances further from the injection well temperatures are higher in the upper part than in the lower part temperatures 40 c for example are found up to a distance of 2 58 m at a depth of 7 5 m but only up to distances of 0 67 m at a depth of 13 5 m which leads to a tilting of the temperature isolines the 11 c isoline of simulated temperature shows corresponding distances of 4 50 m and 3 42 m temperature changes occur in both the lower and upper aquitards via heat conduction from the aquifer to the aquitards although heat is injected only into the aquifer through the screened well section this effect is more pronounced for the upper aquitard because simulated temperatures are higher in the upper part of the aquifer following the injection heat transport is governed primarily by conduction while the influence of heat advection from natural groundwater flow is only minor the simulation shows that the high temperatures near the injection well have already decreased to 62 c two days after the heat injection ended fig 6b and to 49 c seven days after the injection ended simulated temperatures decrease to 31 c after three weeks while after 10 weeks temperatures are only 17 c as heat moves away from the injection well by heat conduction temperatures further from the well and the size of the heat plume increase the distance of the 11 c isoline at 7 5 m depth increases to 10 43 m after 10 weeks the center of the simulated heat plume moves downstream in the direction of groundwater flow i e from north east to south west having travelled about 2 14 m in the 10 weeks after the injection ends fig 6e this decrease in the simulated temperature at the injection well and the spread of heat away from the well is also clear in the vertical cross section where heat is also spreading to the aquitards due to the higher temperatures in the upper part of the aquifer the 15 c isoline of simulated temperatures has spread about 1 18 m into the upper aquitard but only 0 36 m into the lower aquitard after the end of injection the higher heat accumulation at the aquifer top compared to the aquifer bottom as shown by the numerical model is present at the end of the injection but increases further over time the vertical tilt of the heat plume at the top of the aquifer is due to the induced thermal convection in the model the density difference between the hot injected water and the cool ambient groundwater causes the hot water to rise and collect at the top of the aquifer this buoyancy flow induces a vertical redistribution of the injected hot water near the injection well and enhances the spread of the hot water at the upper part of the aquifer away from the injection well the density driven flow does not stop when the injection is over but continues as long as a temperature difference and thus a density difference remains in the aquifer the induced thermal convection also causes a stronger conductive heat transfer towards the upper aquitard compared to the lower aquitard in the long term in the vertical transects of fig 6 the effect of seasonal change on land surface temperature at the upper model boundary becomes more obvious as temperatures in the upper few meters increase in june and then decrease again in august interfering with the heat transported upwards from the aquifer through the upper aquitard also advective transport of heat due to the ambient groundwater flow which is from right to left in the vertical transects can be clearly seen by the growing shift between the location of the injection well and the center of the heat plume fig 7 shows the simulated and measured temperature curves at different depths within the aquifer for the cm wells i e at a distance of 3 1 m from the injection well measured temperatures first increase quickly at all depths and monitoring locations due to the injection with a subsequent cooling at depths of 6 5 m and 7 5 m the maximum temperature occurs within seven days from the end of the injection but only after two weeks for 9 m and 13 5 m and the maximum temperatures are lower at the end of the observation phase about four months after the heat injection the measured temperatures of all sensors have not returned to the initial temperature the initial rapid increase in the measured temperature is caused by the hot water injection into the aquifer and the forced advection dominated heat transport the cooling phase only slowly reduces the temperature due to the conduction dominated heat transport away from the center of the heat plume following the outward temperature gradients advective transport of heat with natural groundwater flow does not lower temperatures quickly due to the low natural flow velocities at the site the highest temperatures measured at depths of 6 5 m and 7 5 m were 47 c and 41 c respectively a maximum temperature of 24 c was observed at 9 m while close to the bottom of the aquifer at 13 5 m the maximum measured temperature was only 14 c this shows that the measured temperatures near the top of the aquifer are about 30 c higher than those near the aquifer bottom although at the same distance from the injection well this temperature distribution is consistent with the temperature distribution predicted by the model as shown in the vertical cross sections of fig 6 due to the high temperature differences and the high hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer thermal convection may be induced which leads to this tilted vertical temperature distribution fig 7 shows that wells of the same depth do not show the same measured peak temperature measured peak temperatures at 9 m in wells w2 ml d03 and w2 ml d04 are significantly higher than in wells w2 ml c04 and w2 ml c08 24 c versus 20 c respectively this effect is also observed at 7 5 m and 13 5 m and can be explained by ambient groundwater flow shifting the center of the heat plume downstream along the flow direction i e towards wells w2 ml d03 and w2 ml d04 see fig 1 for position of wells at a depth of 6 5 m however well w2 ml c04 shows the highest temperature 47 c which cannot be explained by ambient groundwater flow since this well is positioned perpendicular to the groundwater flow direction from the injection well furthermore the downstream well w2 ml d03 shows significantly higher peak temperatures 43 c than the other downstream well w2 ml d04 34 c these observations indicate a heterogeneous distribution of aquifer hydraulic conductivity in the upper part of the aquifer with a higher hydraulic conductivity to the west of the injection well causing advective heat transport to deviate locally in the upper part of the aquifer from the large scale flow direction the comparison of simulated temperatures from the predictive model to the measured temperatures shows that the relatively fast rise and the slow decrease of temperatures as seen in the measured data at all wells is also captured by the model the initial temperature increase shortly after the end of the injection is generally well predicted by the model as is the time of the peak temperature while the maximum temperature is not predicted accurately in all cases for the long term development the agreement between the measured and the predicted temperatures is good the numerical model is thus suitable to accurately predict the time behavior and the long term temperatures showing that the model is able to well predict the general thermal behavior of the experiment however some discrepancies between predicted and measured peak temperatures occur these are highly influenced by the local heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity and by the strength of induced convection the simulated peak temperatures of the downstream wells at 7 5 m w2 ml d03 and w2 ml d04 were 34 c to 36 c respectively higher than those of the wells positioned transverse to the flow direction w2 ml c04 and w2 ml c08 25 c to 27 c respectively similar effects are observed at depths of 6 5 m 9 m and 13 5 m thus the influence of the ambient groundwater flow as observed in the measured data is captured by the model which stresses the relevance of including natural groundwater flow in predictive simulations even at the low flow rates found at the field site the measured order of maximum temperatures at 6 5 m which is caused by local aquifer heterogeneity cannot be captured by a model using homogeneous hydraulic aquifer properties thus some discrepancies between the temperatures predicted by a homogeneous model and the measured temperatures are expected however the agreement between measured and predicted temperatures is good for the long term temperature evolution the larger the mismatch between predicted and measured peak temperature the longer this mismatch is present until it is dampened by heat conduction this shows that for this heat injection experiment the influence of hydraulic heterogeneity during the injection phase on the long term temperature evolution is less important than the correct representation of heat conduction which governs the long term temperature evolution fig 8 shows the results of the ci wells 1 2 m from the injection well the principal behavior with a fast temperature increase due to the advection dominated heat transport and a slower subsequent conduction dominated cooling phase is the same as for the cm wells the temperature peaks occur within three days 27th to 29th may for all depths and measuring locations significantly earlier than the cm wells from 31st may to approximately 15th june the thermal behavior is more advection dominated at the ci wells than for the cm wells which is in accordance with the smaller distance of the ci wells to the injection well the distinct influence of advective heat transport also explains the higher peak temperatures compared to the cm wells at 7 5 m for example a maximum peak temperature of 73 c was measured for the ci wells but only 41 c for the cm wells and at 13 5 m the maximum temperatures were 67 c and 14 c respectively consequently the range in observed peak temperatures was higher at the ci wells than at the cm wells at all depths comparison of peak temperatures of the different wells at e g 6 5 m reveals a difference of 21 c between the highest peak temperature of 65 c at well w2 ml d01 and the lowest peak temperature of 44 c at well w2 ml c07 this could be due to variation in the distances of the ci wells to the injection well see fig 1a which is up to 0 26 m or because of the heterogeneous distribution of hydraulic conductivity which causes an unequal spatial intensity of advective heat transport examination of the cooling phases in fig 8 shows that cooling is faster in the lower parts of the aquifer for example at 6 5 m and 7 5 m temperatures at all wells have decreased to 20 c within 52 days of the injection ending while this decrease occurs in only 41 days and 5 days at depths of 9 m and 13 5 m respectively this indicates an ongoing transfer of heat from the lower to the upper part of the aquifer after the heat injection has stopped which can be explained by thermally induced convection the comparison of predicted and measured temperatures shows that the overall thermal behavior is captured well similar to the cm wells with accuracy being lower for the peak temperatures and higher for the long term temperature evolution larger discrepancies between predicted and measured peak temperatures occur because of the more pronounced advective heat transport at the ci wells compared to the cm wells thus all predicted peak temperatures for one depth are identical in the model approximately matching the average measured peak temperature for the locations where peak temperatures are well matched by the model the temperature decrease is also predicted correctly showing that the relative contributions of advective and conductive heat transport to total heat transport are correctly represented by the model using the derived thermal and hydraulic parameters fig 9 displays the measured temperatures and the temperatures from the predictive model for the co wells 6 5 m from the injection well a similar behavior of the measured temperatures is observed as for the cm and ci results in general i e a temperature increase followed by a temperature decrease however the maximum measured temperature is much lower 15 c co compared to 47 c cm so that the peak is also much less defined the temperature peaks also arrive later at the co wells compared to the cm wells for instance at 7 5 m the temperature peak occurs around three days after the end of the injection for the cm wells and only after 54 days for the co wells the temporal behavior of the temperature increase also differs as with the cm wells a fast temperature rise is followed by a slow cooling phase while for the co wells a much slower temperature rise and temperature decrease is observed these differences are due to the larger distance of the co wells to the injection well the co wells are not directly influenced by advective heat input into the aquifer by the hot water injection instead the thermal signal is caused by conductive heat transport due to the induced temperature gradients these are lower farther away from the injection well therefore a slower reaction to the heat injection occurs at the co wells fig 9 shows that the downstream wells w2 ml d08 w2 2z d09 and w2 ml d10 have significantly higher peak temperatures approximately 15 c in 7 5 m than well w2 2z c10 approximately 12 c in 7 5 m which is positioned perpendicular to the ambient groundwater flow direction this difference is due to the transport of heat with the ambient groundwater flow in the direction of the downstream wells as was observed for the cm wells in fig 7 the predicted temperature curves generally agree well with the measured data indicating a good capability of the model for simulating thermal heat flow at a greater distance from the heat injection well in addition the distinction between the wells showing more pronounced temperature increases i e w2 ml d08 w2 2z d09 and w2 ml d10 due to the larger influence of the ambient groundwater flow and the smaller temperature change at well w2 2z c10 is also correctly predicted by the model this shows as for the cm wells that ambient the groundwater flow velocity was parameterized correctly using the approach outlined in section 3 3 being suitable for predicting longer term temperature changes at greater distances from the injection well starting at the beginning of september i e three months after the end of the heat injection test simulated and measured temperatures start to deviate for the downstream wells w2 ml d08 w2 2z d09 and w2 ml d10 in the upper section of the aquifer at 6 5 m and 7 5 m this deviation of 1 2 c is considered small in the context of the heat injection experiment that is also seen in the cm wells however due to the larger overall temperature change at these wells it is less obvious in fig 7 possible reasons for this deviation may be an overestimation of the vertical upward heat transfer thus lowering the simulated temperatures in the upper part of the aquifer or an underestimation of the influence of the seasonally increasing land surface temperatures 5 discussion the aim of this work was to evaluate the predictive capability of a detailed site investigation in combination with process oriented numerical forward modeling for a high temperature 74 c heat injection into a near surface confined aquifer the parameters estimated for the field site prior to the heat injection test were used in a numerical forward model to predict the spatial and temporal temperature development resulting from the heat injection this temperature distribution was assessed by comparison to high resolution temperature data measured at the heat injection site no inverse modeling or parameter fitting efforts were undertaken in order to assess the suitability of the field investigation methods and the numerical model 5 1 quality of the prediction model overall the predicted and measured temperatures showed good agreement the trends in temperature as well as their spatial dependence and time behavior were predicted correctly the predicted and measured peak temperatures exhibited the greatest differences the average difference was 3 8 c which corresponds to only 5 of the induced temperature 65 c however a maximum deviation of 30 9 c was found close to the injection well where advective heat transport is dominant and temperature is most strongly influenced by small scale heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity the majority of peak temperatures 75 were predicted to within 3 4 c which corresponds to about 5 of the induced temperature signal the prediction of long term thermal impacts was more accurate four months after the injection the average difference between predicted and measured temperatures was 0 73 c which corresponds to 12 of the remaining temperature change i e the highest measured temperature at that time relative to the initial aquifer temperature the maximum temperature difference was 1 87 c 30 of the remaining change the majority of peak temperatures 75 were predicted to within 1 0 c 16 of the remaining change demonstrating that the long term temperature evolution which is mainly governed by heat conduction was well represented in ht ates applications the model is thus suitable for predicting the long term thermal impacts on the aquifer the less accurate peak temperature predictions would mainly affect the storage operation i e return flow temperatures but not the thermal impacts the numerical prediction model opengeosys used here adequately represents the governing heat transport mechanisms i e heat conduction heat advection and induced heat convection as well as their relative contributions to the total heat flow and the resulting temperature distribution these mechanisms depend on the distance to the injection well the time since the injection local temperature gradients and ambient groundwater flow velocity in combination with site specific hydraulic and thermal parameters as demonstrated during mesh generation the ability to assign flexible mesh element sizes to accurately represent the geometric set up is useful as this enables the construction of computational meshes with a high resolution at and near the injection well while restricting the total number of elements to provide a more quantitative measure of the model s predictive capability than a visual comparison of temperature curves and peak temperatures a number of model metrics were calculated and evaluated these were calculated for all available wells within 6 6 m of the injection well at depths of 4 m to 13 5 m as temperatures at these locations changed significantly during the heat injection test the nash sutcliff model efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 a measure of the agreement between observed and predicted data relative to the average of all observations as a prediction yields a value of 0 74 this is a satisfactory prediction according to motovilov et al 1999 or a good prediction according to saleh et al 2000 an nse based on the logarithmic values of the observed and predicted temperatures ln nse 0 80 krause et al 2005 or the absolute instead of the squared differences mod nse 0 58 krause et al 2005 yields similar values ln nse is larger than the nse demonstrating that long term effects are better captured saleh et al 2000 additionally the mean average error mae and the normalized mean average error nmae which normalizes the mae to the temperature change for each measurement location janssen and heuberger 1995 were calculated as mae 0 9 c and nmae 13 4 these metrics are consistent with each other and correspond well to the visual comparison described above reflecting the same prediction quality 5 2 parameterization a prerequisite for a quantitative and accurate representation of the heat transport processes is an adequate quantification of field site and heat transport parameters discrepancies between predicted and measured peak temperatures can be ascribed to the small scale heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity the site investigation showed low spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity therefore the greatest effect on temperature curves mainly occurs at peak temperatures but not on longer term trends which are governed by heat conduction homogeneous hydraulic conductivity was estimated from the multi level pumping test consequently only the average behavior was captured in the model which was sufficiently representative for the field experiment improved hydraulic characterization that provides spatially highly resolved hydraulic conductivity measurements especially close to the injection well could improve predictions of the peak arrival this may be valuable for larger scale ates applications for example where the absolute scale of investigation is larger than the meter scale experiment presented here also due to the repeated injection and extraction cycles of most ates systems advective heat flow would dominate throughout an ates operation while in this study it only dominated in the initial seven day phase of the heat injection experiment thermal parameters were correctly quantified using the methods in this work as demonstrated by the accurate prediction of the long term temperature evolution and the correct shape of the temperature curves variability of these parameters as determined from the field is quite low and suitable investigation methods as described in section 3 can be used to obtain reliable estimates although the spatial scale of the heat plume was small thermal convection was identified as a significant heat transport mechanism for longer term temperature development the rayleigh number ra determined for the numerical model parameters was 12 5 indicating that mixed convection rather than free convection was occurring schout et al 2014 i e thermal convection was not the dominant heat transfer process but it has a significant influence on the resulting temperature distribution therefore in addition to employing the numerical model in a purely predictive mode it was also used to determine the sensitivity of the predicted temperatures on the anisotropy ratio to quantify the predictive uncertainty by varying the anisotropy ratio from 2 39 to 1 and 5 corresponding to ra of 29 9 and 6 0 respectively the nmae increases from 13 4 to 16 0 and 22 0 respectively accordingly a similar but slightly inferior model fit can be achieved using a smaller anisotropy ratio which corresponds to a higher vertical hydraulic conductivity and thus to increased thermal convection with the larger anisotropy ratio of 5 the discrepancy between predicted and measured temperatures increases significantly as thermally induced convection is dampened temperature distribution is therefore sensitive to the anisotropy ratio if the vertical hydraulic conductivity becomes low enough to significantly impair thermally induced convection this also demonstrates that since using 10 as a typical anisotropy ratio estimate would lead to inaccurate predictions this parameter therefore needs to be determined for each individual site the method of depth oriented multilevel pumping tests combined with an analytical solution provides a reliable estimate as shown by the good correspondence of predicted and measured temperatures using the parameterization of table 1 the advantage of this method is that anisotropy can be characterized on the scale of the heat plume in contrast to flow logs taken at the injection well that only characterize the direct surroundings of the injection well and may not be representative of the heat injection experiment a requirement of this is that the pumping and observation wells are suitably located to be representative of the whole field site groundwater flow velocity va was varied from 0 07 m d to 0 05 m d and 0 09 m d which are the average minimum and maximum values obtained from the field site parameterization table 1 the model fit is worse than for the prediction scenario for both lower nmae 14 2 and higher nmae 16 6 va indicating a good model parameterization of the groundwater flow velocity differences were only discernible at larger downstream distances as the maximum change in predicted temperature of 1 c is more significant there natural groundwater flow velocity must be estimated accurately when planning an ates system because it reduces ates efficiency by downstream heat losses even if dampened by thermal retardation a thermal velocity of 0 03 m d can be obtained from the simulation results of the thermal plume development when considering the position of the center of the heat plume 10 weeks after the injection ends this translates into a thermal retardation factor of 2 33 when considering the groundwater flow velocity of 0 07 m d the thermal retardation factor calculated from the aquifer parameters measured from aquifer samples was 1 90 which would result in a slightly higher thermal velocity of 0 04 m d this small difference mainly represents the measurement resolution considering the uncertainties in the estimation of the plume center position and the fact that laboratory measurements of thermal parameters yield only a local value of the thermal retardation factor dispersivity is required by the numerical model but it is difficult to obtain by field measurements and could only be inferred from dedicated thermal field experiments park et al 2015 this method requires fitting to measured temperature data which cannot be performed prior to the injection for the construction of a predictive model however a sensitivity analysis shows that reducing both longitudinal and transverse dispersivity from 0 1 m to 0 01 m causes distinct changes to predicted temperatures in the upper part of the aquifer close to the injection well of up to 10 c due to the reduced mixing at lower dispersivity the buoyancy flow intensity increases which causes a slightly stronger tilting of the heat plume the dispersivity is only sensitive close to the injection well and only during injection of the hot water since the high flow velocities from the injection result in a large contribution of dispersion to overall heat transport using a higher dispersivity value has the opposite effect of reducing thermal convection therefore some ambiguity exists as dispersivity and vertical hydraulic conductivity both influence induced convection this can be resolved by a reliable determination of the anisotropy ratio and emphasizes the need for a reliable estimate of the vertical hydraulic conductivity in practical heat storage applications additional data can be obtained by monitoring in this work a purely predictive approach based on parameters obtained prior to the heat injection was used this data could be used i e by applying inverse modeling or model calibration to better constrain the model and improve predictions accordingly the applied model metrics are also beneficial for that and this work presents a valuable parameterization basis for the initial model 5 3 comparison with other studies this work shows that depth specific pumping tests with depth dependent drawdown measurements are suitable for characterizing the hydraulic parameters including vertical hydraulic conductivity this is in accordance with the pioneering work of parr et al 1983 that applied a single depth dependent test during well installation to derive this parameter on a larger spatial scale and for a larger experimental setting the findings presented here show that an approach using more pumping depths and observation points is also suitable on a smaller scale heat capacity and thermal conductivity values were based on direct measurements of sediment samples in this study while this is the preferred method sediment samples are not necessarily available at all sites parr et al 1983 and bridger and allen 2014 achieved sufficient accuracy by using correlations with indirect measurements of porosity and sediment composition which may be used if direct measurements are not available other methods involve the thermal parameterization from geophysical well logs grain size data and porosity via empirical relations visser et al 2015 and from combined solute thermal tracer tests wildemeersch et al 2014 while the first method has the advantage of providing highly resolved vertical profiles of thermal parameters at the logged wells the second approach can provide representative values at the field scale both methods however are relatively sophisticated and consequently laborious and costly for the field site in this study thermal parameterization by direct measurements was deemed the most appropriate method in line with the results of vandenbohede et al 2011 who modeled a shallow heat injection test for parameter inversion the parameters of conductive transport were determined more reliably than those regarding advective transport the aquifer used for heat injection was relatively homogeneous and showed no strong sedimentological or hydraulic substructures therefore a thermally and hydraulically homogeneous aquifer parameterization could be employed molson et al 1992 also used a homogeneous model to simulate subsurface temperatures following a heat injection test with high accuracy compared to the observed field temperature however contrary to the present study molson et al 1992 calibrated the ground surface heat transfer coefficient and the unfrozen moisture relationship to match the observed temperatures their model is thus not a purely predictive model while this study shows that the applied site investigation is suitable for a predictive simulation ganguly et al 2017 and buscheck et al 1983 also used homogeneous models to simulate ates experiments and concluded that they could predict the average temperature distribution without the preferential movement of heat caused by a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity distribution their finding is corroborated by this work for a heat injection test in a near surface aquifer visser et al 2015 and bridger and allen 2014 examined the influence of heterogeneity on the thermal impact for the simulation of lt ates systems and found that the maximum horizontal thermal plume extent and the maximum simulated temperature would be underestimated by a homogeneous model this was explained by preferential heat transport along high hydraulic conductivity layers and the subsequent focusing of heat their findings show that calibrating a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity could allow for a better fit of the maximum temperatures and a better representation of the spread of these maximum temperatures at the individual monitoring positions on the other hand visser et al 2015 stated that both homogeneous and heterogeneous models realistically simulated the actual temperatures furthermore bridger and allen 2010 conclude from a lt ates simulation study using a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity distribution that in most cases homogeneous approaches are sufficient to reproduce the system behavior while heterogeneous approaches can result in model uncertainties as large as for more simplified models consequently the homogeneous approach employed in this study is considered satisfactory in terms of the results with the least effort in parameterization in addition to the sensitivity of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity distribution on the thermal plume shape bridger and allen 2014 found that besides dispersivity simulated temperatures were most sensitive to the anisotropy even for a lt ates system this result is corroborated by this work with the sensitivity to the anisotropy being even more pronounced due to the significantly higher injection temperature applied here together with the observed temperature distributions this indicates the presence of buoyancy flow in the experiment which has also been observed in field experiments by e g molz et al 1983 and palmer et al 1992 miller and delin 2002 and delin et al 2002 however found only minimal buoyancy flow in their experiments despite high injection temperatures of 88 c to 118 c this could be because of the insensitivity of the monitoring network to this process or thin low permeable layers within the sandstone aquifer this demonstrates the importance of site specific parameter investigation to reliably predict thermal impacts for ht ates plants gossler et al 2019 investigated thermal retardation in 1d laboratory experiments and found that the thermal retardation factor calculated from the material properties compared well to the experimentally observed value and no significant thermal non equilibrium effects appeared this is corroborated in this study for a field experiment at a larger scale the assignment of a temperature profile as the initial condition for the whole model domain as in this study is clearly preferable over using a constant initial temperature this has also been used by e g collignon et al 2020 kim et al 2010 and molson et al 1992 this requires measuring a vertical profile over a longer time period to understand the temporal dynamics in addition to vertically differing temperatures visser et al 2015 reported a lateral variation in temperature distribution due to the presence of buildings at their site in the present study only insignificant lateral temperature variations were found but variations would have been detected by the experimental setup and could have been included in the numerical prediction model 6 conclusions a shallow heat injection test was conducted with an injection of 74 c water into an aquifer for 4 5 days the hydraulic and thermal properties of the aquifer were investigated prior to the heat injection test and a predictive high resolution numerical simulation of the coupled thermo hydraulic processes was performed based on these parameters the comparison of the predicted spatial and temporal temperature distributions to the measured temperatures showed good agreement conclusions from this work are as follows the numerical process model parameterized based on a priori site investigation data could accurately predict the overall thermal behavior induced by the heat injection test the intensity of the heat transport processes particularly advective and conductive heat transport as well as temperature induced convection is correctly simulated the model prediction has a high accuracy especially for long term and far field temperature evolution which is crucial for assessing the thermal impact on the aquifer the accuracy of predicted temperatures is lower for the temperature peaks close to the injection well as these are most influenced by the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity which is not represented in the homogeneous model the vertical temperature distribution is sensitive to the vertical hydraulic conductivity which determines the intensity of buoyancy flow depth oriented multi level pumping tests enable a reliable estimation of both the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer the numerical process model described in this work is suitable for designing ht ates systems in regard to thermal and hydraulic processes and for assessing the induced thermal impacts

4632,high temperature aquifer thermal energy storage ht ates is a promising option to compensate for the seasonal mismatch between heating supply and demand in the heating sector based on renewable energies to test and verify numerical and experimental methods for predicting ht ates thermo hydraulic impacts a small scale heat injection test with injection temperatures of 70 c was conducted in a shallow aquifer and monitored using a dense temperature sensor network prior to the heat injection test the hydraulic and thermal properties of the field site were investigated and a predictive high resolution numerical simulation model of the coupled thermo hydraulic processes was derived based only on this a priori information the comparison of measured and predicted temperature breakthrough curves showed a good correspondence suggesting that the model is able to predict the overall thermal behavior the model predictions were most accurate for long term and far field temperature evolution with lower accuracy for temperature peaks closer to the injection well density driven buoyancy flow was identified as an active heat transport process due to the relatively high vertical hydraulic conductivity the numerical model parameterized based only on a priori site investigation data is shown suitable for predicting heat transport processes due to a high temperature heat injection as well

sustainable development policies asif and muneer 2007 united nations 2015 the heating sector is crucial to this since it accounts for approximately 50 of global energy consumption ren21 2016 however a disadvantage of renewable heating sources is the seasonal mismatch between energy supply and demand to overcome this challenge underground thermal energy storage utes has attracted increasing attention novo et al 2010 sanner et al 2003 and could significantly contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions buscheck et al 2017 dinçer 2000 among the different utes technologies for seasonal heat storage aquifer thermal energy storage ates provides large storage capacities and high storage rates dinçer and rosen 2011 this technology is based on alternating injection and extraction of water via wells from and into an aquifer with heat stored in summer by injecting heated groundwater which is retrieved in winter by re extraction while most ates systems have relatively low injection temperatures fleuchaus et al 2018 high temperature ates ht ates using injection temperatures 50 c has a higher overall energy storage capacity than low temperature ates lt ates it can be combined with other renewable technologies e g solar biomass geothermal or industrial heat waste and the extracted hot water can be used for heating purposes without the need for additional heat pumps fleuchaus et al 2020 the suitability of ates systems depends on their economic viability and regulatory compliance therefore a detailed characterization of hydrogeological and physical parameters is essential especially for ht ates systems numerical modeling is required for designing such ates systems because of the structure of suitable geological aquifers and the feedback between flow and heat transport processes bloemendal et al 2018 kabuth et al 2017 it is also useful for evaluating the effects of ates on the subsurface if monitoring data is limited visser et al 2015 in ht ates free convection is induced by buoyancy flow from the density difference between the injected hot water and the aquifer water at ambient temperatures schout et al 2014 to correctly simulate the buoyancy flow intensity the heat transfer and groundwater flow processes have to be implemented in a coupled manner in numerical codes collignon et al 2020 kolditz et al 1998 and high spatial and temporal resolutions are required in regions of spatially and temporally steep hydraulic and thermal gradients therefore to accurately predict storage capacities rates and losses bauer et al 2017 and the effects from heat loss and changes of the hydraulic regime the governing hydraulic and thermal processes have to be understood for a range of geological settings and under different operational schemes e g injection temperature flow rates etc specifically the long term impacts of ht ates must be reliably quantifiable bauer et al 2013 for subsurface planning and to identify the potential geochemical effects induced by ht ates plants to achieve this experimental and numerical methods must be developed and verified that due to the complexity of geological aquifers require dedicated and well monitored field experiments heat injection tests can be used to investigate thermal and hydraulic processes and impacts the injection of hot water into an aquifer with no extraction enables the intact propagation of the thermal signal and observation of the subsequent cooling of the produced heat plume palmer et al 1992 conducted a heat injection test at 35 c in a shallow unconfined aquifer and monitored the resulting temperature distribution with high spatial resolution the investigated processes and the experiment were successfully simulated by molson et al 1992 a similar experiment with subsequent numerical simulations at an injection temperature of 48 c was performed by vandenbohede et al 2011 in a shallow unconfined aquifer their study focused on parameter identification and reliability and showed that parameters controlling conductive transport are more reliably derived than parameters determining convective transport wagner et al 2014 conducted a heat injection test with an injection temperature of 22 c into an unconfined shallow alluvial aquifer this enabled the layering of the aquifer to be inferred and the identification of flow along preferential flow paths wildemeersch et al 2014 conducted a combined heat and tracer experiment in an alluvial aquifer with an injection temperature of 40 c that enabled the determination of heat transfer parameters from the breakthrough curves at the recovery well under forced gradient dipole conditions klepikova et al 2016 used inverse modeling from the additional use of temperatures measured at observation wells installed at the same field site to infer preferential flow paths doro et al 2015 investigated forced gradient dipole heat injection tests with injection temperatures of 25 c they applied thermal tracer tomography to characterize the heterogeneity of the shallow alluvial aquifer and observed a strong dampening of temperature signals close to the injection well due to high heat diffusivity this could be alleviated by increased injection temperatures or prolonged injection however higher injection temperatures increase process complexity because fluid density and viscosity is temperature dependent to the best of our knowledge there have been no investigations using a high temperature heat injection test in a shallow subsurface aquifer the monitoring of the long term impacts and the reliability of numerical predictions of thermal impacts for such a test have not been demonstrated in contrast to heat injection experiments ates experiments have been performed with high injection temperatures for example molz et al 1978 1981 1983 performed a series of ht ates field tests with injection temperatures of up to 81 c in a sedimentary aquifer these studies demonstrated the technical feasibility of ht ates and provided data for the testing and development of numerical models some of these experiments have been numerically simulated with good agreement between measured and simulated data for the extraction temperatures buscheck et al 1983 tsang et al 1982 temperature at observation wells ganguly et al 2017 or both papadopulos and larson 1978 sykes et al 1982 parr et al 1983 determined field site parameters by applying classical field investigation methods e g pumping tests and the line source method that were then used in subsequent modeling similarly taddia et al 2016 examined a glaciofluvial unconfined aquifer in order to install an open loop groundwater heat pump system they focused on the evaluation of a pumping test arguing that parameters influencing advective heat transport such as the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity can thus be determined miller and delin 2002 and delin et al 2002 reported a series of ht ates field experiments with injection temperatures of 88 c to 118 c in cambrian sandstone aquifers at depths between 180 m and 240 m and carried out numerical simulations of these experiments however none of these experimental and numerical studies have identified whether traditional field investigation methods are sufficient for realistic predictive numerical simulations of ht ates nor which parameters are most important this paper therefore examines whether the determination of thermal and hydraulic parameters using standard field investigation methods is sufficiently reliable for predicting transient temperature distribution and the coupled thermo hydraulic effects induced by a high temperature heat injection to achieve this a small scale heat injection test using a well doublet in a shallow sandy aquifer was performed with injection temperatures 70 c prior to the heat injection test the aquifer was characterized by hydrogeological methods and a predictive simulation was performed using high resolution numerical process modeling of the field injection test based on the a priori information the predicted temperature distribution was then compared to the measured temperatures for verification of the process understanding and the applied numerical and site investigation methods 2 heat injection test 2 1 field site the experimental field site was approximately 100 km north of berlin near the town of wittstock dosse brandenburg northern germany on a former military airfield fig 1 c the test site was approximately 50 m 40 m with a maximum difference in ground elevation of 0 45 m the field site is operated by kiel university and the helmholtz centre for environmental research ufz and has been used to study induced impacts and monitoring methods for co2 gas injection lamert et al 2012 peter et al 2013 2012 schulz et al 2012 the field site has been extended and is currently used to investigate the effects of high temperature heat storage and leakage from gas storage within the testum aquifer project hornbruch et al in prep the regional geology consists of glacial and glacio fluvial sediments of quaternary age from the saale and vistula glacial stages see also peter et al 2012 the local geological structure was derived using core samples and the results from hydraulic profiling tool hpt logs geoprobe systems 2013 mccall and christy 2020 hpt logs are based on the depth dependent ratio of the injected water flow rate to the corresponding pressure response corrected by the atmospheric and piezometric pressure q pc ml min kpa fig 2 the higher the ratio the higher the relative hydraulic conductivity of the sediment three examples of these profiles are shown in fig 2 the geological profiles of the wells w2 4z c00 and mp001 are based on the in situ evaluation of the drilled material while for the injection well the material was repacked and transported to the laboratory for detailed characterization the hpt logs correspond well to the geological profiles indicating the presence of a highly permeable unsaturated layer from the ground surface to approximately 3 m below ground level 1 1 all depth information in this article is below ground level followed by a low hydraulic conductivity layer to approximately 6 m and a more permeable layer down to 15 m depth that was the aquifer used as the injection horizon for the heat injection test the aquifer is underlain by a low hydraulic conductivity glacial till layer these profiles were also identified in the geological profiles especially the clayey and silty section with intersecting sandy parts between 3 m and 6 m and the primarily sandy materials of the aquifer the measured groundwater heads were at approximately 3 3 m indicating that the aquifer is confined and the uppermost permeable layer forms the unsaturated zone while the evaluation of pumping tests section 3 3 suggests that the low hydraulic conductivity unit above the saturated aquifer acts as an aquiclude based on the hpt and sedimentological data this unit is interpreted as an aquitard the permeable layer beneath the aquifer below about 15 m depth is characterized as silty fine sand at mp001 silty fine sand to clayey silt at the injection well and as gravelly silt at w2 4z c00 the geological layering is found consistently throughout the field site and there is no significant variation in grain size in the layers between the boreholes in the area of influence of the heat injection test therefore a simplified geological interpretation of an unsaturated zone ground level to 3 m upper aquitard 3 m to 6 m aquifer 6 m to 15 m and lower aquitard 15 m to 20 m is used in this work this is consistent with the geological layering identified by peter et al 2012 the local groundwater flow direction as inferred from interpolation of the groundwater level measurements from august 2019 is from east northeast to west southwest with a mean hydraulic gradient of 0 0011 this is aligned with the regional flow direction towards the river dosse situated approximately 800 m west that acts as a discharge zone both the gradient and direction are consistent with values reported by peter et al 2012 2 2 technical setup one injection well one extraction well and 17 observation wells were installed fig 1 and equipped for the heat injection test during the site set up phase in 2018 sonic drilling was used this requires no annular space filling because the wells are directly inserted into the collapsing borehole it also enables taking liners at drilling locations and the application of technologies for hydrogeologic characterization if used separately from drilling two types of wells were used two inch wells and continuous multichannel tubing system wells cmt solinst georgetown canada referred to here as multilevel wells fig 1b the two inch observation wells were screened in three screen center depths 7 5 m 10 5 m 13 5 m to four 7 5 m 9 5 m 11 5 m 13 5 m sections each 1 m long within the aquifer which allowed for vertically oriented pumping and pressure monitoring during pumping tests the multilevel observation wells were screened at four to five depths some at 5 0 m all at 7 5 m 10 5 m 13 5 m 17 0 m with a screen length of 5 cm 10 cm which allowed for low flow and low volume groundwater sampling at specific and well defined depths the injection and the extraction well were two inch wells fully screened from 7 m to 14 m i e in the confined aquifer the extraction well was placed 40 m upstream from the injection well water was extracted from the aquifer during heat injection through the extraction well and pumped into a cold water storage tank from there the water passed through a plate heat exchanger where it was heated to the desired temperature 74 c passed into a hot water tank and gravitationally reinjected into the aquifer at the injection well an oil fired boiler provided the heating the water flowed through a one inch pipe installed inside the injection well to the well bottom from where it flowed back through the well screen to the aquifer this installation prohibits density driven buoyancy flow of the hot water in the upper part of the injection well which would result in preferential heat injection at the top of the aquifer both the flow rate and the temperature of the injected water were measured continuously at the wellhead of the injection well proline promag p 300 flowmeter and easytemp tmr31 sensor endress hauser gmbh co kg weil am rhein germany no flow rate measurements were taken at the extraction well because the extraction rate was on average equal to the injection rate for monitoring temperature distribution in the subsurface 17 observation wells and the injection well were equipped with thermocouple sensors type t labfacility ltd bognor regis united kingdom and type t class 1 omega engineering gmbh deckenpfronn germany with a resolution of 1 c temperature was measured at 1 m 2 m 4 m 5 m 6 5 m 7 5 m 9 m 10 5 m 13 5 m and 16 5 m yielding a higher vertical resolution at the aquifer top the sensors were attached to the outside of the tubing during installation of the wells and were connected to a central logging unit with cables 30 cm deep in the ground of the 180 installed thermocouples 11 failed up until november 2019 and several time gaps in the temperature measurements occurred due to technical problems the measuring interval was successively increased from 1 min at the start of the experiment in may 2019 to 20 min from july 2019 onwards eight solinst levelogger 3001 pressure loggers solinst canada ltd georgetown canada recorded pressure in the two inch wells nmr01 nmr02 nmr03 nmr04 w2 2z c10 w2 2z d09 w2 2z u07 and w2 2z u15 fig 1 furthermore three moisture sensors smt 100 umwelt geräte technik gmbh müncheberg germany were installed just outside wells w2 ml u14 1 m depth and w2 ml d01 1 m and 7 5 m depth to monitor potential gas phase formation from degassing of the hot injected water the temperature sensors and pressure loggers fig 1a were positioned before the heat injection test based on the numerical simulations the monitoring locations with a similar distance to the injection well can be divided into three groups circle inside ci circle middle cm and circle outside co that had a radius of 1 2 m 3 1 m and 6 5 m around the injection well respectively fig 1a due to space restrictions at the field site the monitoring locations were not situated exactly on these circles and thus had slightly different distances to the injection well the transect flow direction fd was defined to monitor temperature distributions along the direction of natural groundwater flow the names of the wells are indicative of their position relative to the injection well with d designating downstream u upstream and c to the side of the injection well 2 3 heat injection the heat injection test was performed in may 2019 over seven days with the actual injection time being approximately 4 5 days fig 3 shows the flow rate and temperature of the injected water during the first seven days injection of water into the aquifer started at 19 20 on 23rd may 2019 with an injection of unheated water for 85 min using a flow rate of approximately 14 l min 0 84 m3 h at 20 45 the heater was switched on and the temperature of the injected water increased to 74 c within 45 min see fig 3 inertia effects in the heater control system caused variations in injection temperature of 1 5 c during the phase of relatively constant injection and in the injection flow rate of 0 2 l min after approximately three days of continuous injection the injection flow rate started to decline at first slowly and then more rapidly on days four and five hot water injection was therefore stopped at 05 42 on 28th may when achievable flow rates dropped to 1 l min a second injection phase was initiated on 29th may in an attempt to reactivate the heat injection but was stopped after 5 5 h due to the low achievable rate in total 85 74 m3 of water and 6437 kwh of heat were injected during both phases of which the second injection contributed only 3 13 during the active operation time of 110 47 h the average injection flow rate was 12 93 l min and the average injection temperature 73 76 c the observed decline in achievable injection flow rate could have been caused by well clogging from mineral precipitation griffioen and appelo 1993 willemsen 1990 fine particle transport andersson 1990 molz et al 1981 or reduced injectivity because of gas phase formation in the aquifer close to the injection well jenne et al 1992 lüders et al 2016 microscopic investigations following the heat injection test did not detect biomass in the injection well thus clogging due to mineral precipitation had probably occurred in the aquifer close to the injection well temperatures were measured prior to the experiment at all available locations as described above they are reported here for the first four months after the injection 3 numerical simulation a 3d numerical coupled groundwater flow and heat transport model for the heat injection test was constructed using the opengeosys ogs code ogs is a scientific open source finite element simulator especially developed and designed to simulate coupled processes in the subsurface kolditz et al 2012a kolditz and bauer 2004 it has been used in a number of studies on thermal and thermo hydraulic coupled problems in the context of geothermal engineering and subsurface energy use and is suitable for a range of thermal applications i e geothermal heat storage boockmeyer and bauer 2014 kastner et al 2017 popp et al 2015 deep geothermal energy extraction wang and bauer 2016 and groundwater flow and transport simulations ogs is especially suitable for variable density flow diersch and kolditz 2002 and has been well validated and documented kolditz et al 2018 2015 2012b 3 1 governing equations the governing equations describing the processes implemented in ogs are presented below the groundwater flow equation for a fully saturated porous medium in a pressure based formulation from bear and bachmat 1990 can be written as 3 1 s 0 p w t k μ w t p w ρ w t g q w where s0 1 pa is the storage coefficient pw pa is water pressure t s is time ρw t kg m3 is temperature dependent water density t k is temperature µw t pas is temperature dependent dynamic viscosity of water k m2 is the intrinsic permeability tensor g m s2 is the vector of gravitational acceleration and qw 1 s is the water source sink term as ρw t is lower for higher temperatures in the temperature range of 9 c to 78 c considered here warmer water tends to flow upwards due to buoyancy driven flow collignon et al 2020 also µw t is lower for higher temperatures resulting in a reduced resistance to groundwater flow and thus a higher water flow velocity and reduced pressure gradients due to the injection hydraulic conductivity k is assumed anisotropic with anisotropy described by the anisotropy factor i e the ratio of horizontal to vertical hydraulic conductivity kh kv the heat transport equation includes both convection and conduction processes bear

density of the porous medium thus the volumetric heat capacities of the porous medium cρ t and of the water phase cwρw t are also considered temperature dependent v m s is the water flow velocity vector n is porosity dh w m k is the heat conduction dispersion tensor and qt j m3 s is the heat source sink term the volumetric heat capacity of the saturated porous medium cρ j m3 k is calculated as 3 3 c ρ t c s ρ s 1 n c w ρ w t n where cs j kg k is the specific heat capacity of the solid phase and ρs kg m3 is the density of the solid phase the heat diffusion dispersion tensor in eq 3 2 is given by 3 4 d h n λ w 1 n λ s n c w ρ w β t v δ i j β l β t v i v j v where λw and λs w m k are the thermal conductivities of the water and the solid phase respectively βl and βt m are the longitudinal and the transverse dispersivity respectively vi and vj m s are the i and j components of the fluid velocity respectively with i j x y z and δij is the kronecker delta since the effects of density have to be considered collignon et al 2020 an iterative coupling scheme was applied to solve the heat transport and groundwater flow equations boockmeyer and bauer 2014 wang and bauer 2016 3 2 model setup the numerical model was 300 m 150 m 20 m fig 4 which was shown by field site test simulations to be sufficiently large to minimize boundary effects on water flow and heat transport the injection well was located laterally in the center of the model and the model top was at the average land surface the model area and mesh were oriented with the longer axis parallel to the natural groundwater flow direction the finite element mesh consisted of 195 129 nodes with the elements increasing from 1 5 cm at the injection well to 15 m at the model boundaries utilizing the flexible unstructured grid options available in ogs the maximum element size within the area depicted in fig 1a i e where experimental data were available was 1 4 m the model represents the vertical geological structure as shown in fig 2 vertically the mesh consisted of 98 layers with a thickness of either 0 125 m or 0 25 m where the refinements are placed at the top and the bottom of the aquifer the computational mesh is thus refined at those locations where the maximum temperature and pressure gradients occur in order to ensure numerical accuracy and stability the numerical model grid was tested for grid convergence by increasing and decreasing the horizontal and vertical grid resolution by a factor of two during coarsening and refining the maximum differences in simulated temperatures were less than 0 20 c and 0 10 c respectively which is below the measurement accuracy of the field thermocouples in tests of time step length maximum deviations of less than 0 20 c and 0 10 c were found when increasing and decreasing the time step by a factor of two respectively thus temporal and spatial discretion were sufficient the initial temperature distribution in the model was interpolated from the vertical temperature profiles measured at the monitoring locations and the daily average of the atmospheric temperature for 23rd may 2019 i e the first day of the simulation as all monitoring locations near the injection well showed the same vertical temperature profile this temperature profile was interpolated over the whole model area assuming there were no horizontal variations the average temperature in the aquifer was 9 21 c this increased to approximately 14 c at the surface because of the seasonal rise in near surface temperatures in spring and summer a time variant dirichlet boundary condition prescribed temperature was assigned at the top of the model domain using time series of the atmospheric temperature measured at a climate station of deutscher wetterdienst dwd 1 12 km from the test site which were averaged on the simulation time steps the assignment of atmospheric temperature as a boundary condition is a simplification the ground surface temperature may deviate from the air temperature e g visser et al 2015 mann and schmidt 2003 but this approach was justified since good agreement between measured and simulated temperature profiles was observed before during and after the heat injection at locations near and far from the injection well the 6 m vertical distance between the ground surface and the top of the storage formation together with the parameters determined for the upper aquitard sufficiently reduced the short term temperature fluctuations to justify the chosen boundary condition at the bottom the temperature was fixed at 9 43 c which corresponds to the initial measured temperature it is assumed that this temperature did not change during the experiment as this boundary is 5 m below the aquifer used for heat injection and the estimated diffusive time scale is approximately nine months inflowing water at the vertical inflow faces of the aquifer layer was set to the initial water temperature while a zero temperature gradient boundary condition was applied at the outflow faces to allow for possible heat loss by advective heat transfer the initial pressure distribution is temperature dependent because of the temperature dependent water density used in the model see section 3 3 for specific density values therefore the initial pressure distribution has to account for the initial temperature distribution derived from the measurements a spin up simulation is required to get consistent sets of initial pressure and temperature ambient natural groundwater flow in the aquifer is accounted for by superposition of the initial vertical pressure distribution with the gradient of the groundwater level derived from piezometric head measurements see above at the vertical model faces this initial pressure distribution is prescribed as a dirichlet boundary condition thus inducing the ambient natural groundwater flow no flow boundary conditions are set at the top and bottom model faces the injection and extraction well were simulated by specifying water flow rates and injection temperature for the mesh nodes in the aquifer layer between 7 m and 14 m depth along a vertical line at the respective well positions injection and extraction rates were given as a function over time by applying the measured injection flow rate fig 3 for both the injection and extraction well as neumann boundary conditions thus maintaining the water balance of the aquifer the injection temperature fig 3 was assigned to the well nodes of the injection well as a dirichlet boundary condition while at the extraction well the temperature was calculated by the model the flow rate and injection temperature were measured with a temporal resolution of 1 min therefore values were averaged for the simulation time step an automatic time stepping scheme was applied with the maximum time step limited to 1 h during the first injection phase and to 5 min during the second injection phase as both injection flow rate and temperature strongly fluctuate over this period the maximum allowed time step gradually increases from 6 h to 10 days after the end of injection 3 3 model parameterization a set of hydraulic and thermal investigation methods was used to parameterize the numerical model according to the four geological layers shown in fig 2 table 1 summarizes the results for the aquifer layer and table 2 summarizes the results for the unsaturated zone and the confining layers for estimating hydraulic conductivity pumping tests and sieve curve analysis permeameter tests of repacked sediment material from liners and slug tests were performed pumping tests were also used to obtain estimates of the anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity and of the specific storage the pumping tests were carried out at the two inch well nmr04 in three different screened sections at 9 m to 10 m 11 m to 12 m and 13 m to 14 m nmr04 was chosen because it is only 2 5 m from the injection well and has the three screen sections required for estimating the anisotropy ratio the injection well is fully screened and thus not suitable the duration of pumping varied from 5 min to 10 min with pumping rates of 4 9 l min to 5 8 l min the induced transient pressure signal was observed in three depths at the three observation wells w2 2z d09 w2 2z u01 and w2 2z u07 which are representative for the heat site providing a total of 27 drawdown curves i e nine drawdown curves for each pumping test at a specific screen depth one solinst levelogger 3001 solinst canada ltd georgetown canada was placed in each screen section separated by a purpose built multi packer system to hydraulically insulate the different screen sections the measured pressure responses were evaluated using aqtesolv pro v4 5 software duffield 2007 each drawdown curve was evaluated separately for the determination of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and specific storage while the three drawdown curves for one well were fitted simultaneously for the estimation of the anisotropy ratio the analytical solution of dougherty and babu 1984 for a confined aquifer was applied this is based on theis 1935 and hantush 1961a 1961b and is applicable for pumping tests in multiple partially penetrating wells and accounts for both wellbore storage and wellbore skin effects since the pumping well has a small well casing radius of 0 025 m the well storage effect can be neglected while the wellbore skin factor was obtained during the evaluation the good data fits obtained from the selected analytical solution show that the confining unit acts as an aquiclude or low conductivity aquitard and that no recharge sources are present which agrees with the field investigations as described above the hydraulic conductivity of the injection aquifer only showed slight variation at the field site between 2 24 10 4 m s and 3 79 10 4 m s for the individual curves with an average of 3 19 10 4 m s the anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity was estimated between 2 37 and 2 40 for the three observation wells with an average of 2 39 which was used in the model for parameterizing the anisotropy factor specific storage values ranged from 1 26 10 05 1 m to 8 62 10 05 1 m with an average of 3 39 10 05 1 m grain size distributions were obtained by sieving and elutriation of aquifer material samples taken from the field hydraulic conductivity values were estimated using empirical correlations from hazen 1892 beyer 1964 kaubisch 1986 and seiler 1973 values varied from 3 00 10 5 m s to 5 16 10 4 m s with an average of 2 29 10 4 m s this is in good agreement with the pumping test results but with a wider range due to the smaller sample size permeameter tests were conducted using sieved and repacked aquifer material noethen 2018 and yielded much lower hydraulic conductivities than the two methods above probably due to the repacking and compacting required for these experiments these values were therefore disregarded after identification of hydrostratigraphic units using direct push hpt logging butler et al 2002 slug tests were carried out at mp002 within the aquifer hydraulic conductivities of 7 15 10 4 m s and 7 04 10 4 m s were derived with an average of 7 10 10 4 m s due to the small scale nature of the measurement these values cannot be considered as representative of the whole aquifer and are consequently not used for model parameterization overall the estimated hydraulic conductivity ranged from 3 0 10 05 m s to 7 15 10 04 m s table 1 the average from the pumping test data was 3 19 10 04 m s this value was used for model parameterization because the multi level pumping tests provide an estimate of the hydraulic conductivity at the relevant field scale i e at the scale of the heat injection test as well as providing consistent estimates for specific storage and the anisotropy ratio the estimates of hydraulic conductivity from the laboratory measurements are inferred from small and therefore less representative volumes of aquifer material removed from in situ conditions furthermore the pore network in the field is altered due to liner sampling repacking and possible drying effects previous studies have shown that the hydraulic conductivity estimate from pumping tests is typically higher than that derived from grain size analysis berg and illman 2011 hu 2011 as flow may circumvent zones of low hydraulic conductivity however all measurements indicated similar hydraulic conductivity supporting the findings of reasonable homogeneity from the field investigations the average hydraulic conductivity and specific storage values were recalculated to the required units as indicated in eq 3 1 and used for parameterization of the homogeneous flow and heat transport model total porosity was determined by measuring bulk and rock density and had a wide range from 0 29 to 0 47 the porosity value of 0 4 measured by harder 2019 is considered an outlier as it is much higher than the values measured by noethen 2018 and peter et al 2012 for the same site and hölting and coldewey 2013 for similar sediments the values reported by peter et al 2012 range from 0 30 to 0 34 for sandy materials which are consistent with the new measurements of the aquifer materials small scale in situ measurements of soil moisture smt 100 umwelt geräte technik gmbh müncheberg germany at well w2 ml d01 in the saturated aquifer gave a porosity value of approximately 0 36 which fits well with the range from other methods therefore in the model a porosity of 0 34 was used as an average and representative value based on the measurement of hydraulic conductivity and porosity and applying the average hydraulic gradient of 0 0011 obtained from piezometric head measurements on site the groundwater flow velocity was 0 09 m d peter et al 2012 reported slightly lower groundwater flow velocities varying from 0 05 m d to 0 07 m d derived from a salt tracer test tens of meters from the heat injection location as an average of these possible flow velocities 0 07 m d was used in the predictive model both longitudinal and transverse dispersivity is required for the numerical model no values were determined for the field site specifically as no direct field measurement method is available thus a value of 0 1 m each was applied this value allows for a numerically stable simulation while minimizing numerical dispersion thermal conductivity and volumetric heat capacity were measured using a kd2 pro thermal properties analyzer decagon devices inc pullman usa and a representative set of aquifer materials fifteen measurements were performed on water saturated sediments still enclosed in the liners as obtained from the field site bulk thermal conductivity varied from 2 55 w m k to 3 40 w m k similar to the range reported by otto 2012 of 2 40 w m k to 3 20 w m k for saturated sandy sediments in northern germany no obvious correlation to the sedimentology of the samples was found so no spatial distribution could be derived due to the rather small overall variability a thermal conductivity of 3 00 w m k was assigned to the model representing the mean value of all measurements bulk volumetric heat capacity ranged from 1 94 mj m3 k to 3 26 mj m3 k with an overall average of 2 70 mj m3 k as for thermal conductivity this average was used as a homogeneous value in the model temperature dependent correlations for the density and dynamic viscosity of water are required for the parameterization of the water phase empirical functions supplied by the physikalisch technische bundesanstalt ptb 1994 for water density and by yaws 1995 for dynamic viscosity were used for the unsaturated zone and both aquitards no hydraulic parameters were determined only very low hydraulic conductivity is expected for the aquitards as the pumping test evaluation gave no indication of a leaky aquitard layer therefore there are no significant hydraulic effects from the upper unsaturated zone so it was not investigated for this reason groundwater flow is omitted in these layers field scale thermal parameters were estimated for the unsaturated zone and the upper aquitard using a 1d purely diffusive heat transport model this model simulated the natural seasonal temperature variability for six months prior to the heat injection test by applying the measured surface temperature as a boundary condition and fitting the simulated temperature profiles to the measured temperature profiles this approach has been applied on a larger scale to investigate subsurface heat flow and temperature distributions bayer et al 2016 the volumetric heat capacity and the thermal conductivity were 1 6 mj m3 k and 2 0 mj m3 k and 1 9 w m k and 2 4 w m k for the unsaturated zone and the upper aquitard respectively table 2 these values are within the ranges for corresponding sediments of 1 6 mj m3 k to 2 2 mj m3 k and 1 0 w m k to 1 9 w m k for the unsaturated zone and of 1 5 mj m3 k to 2 5 mj m3 k and 1 1 w m k to 2 9 w m k for the upper aquitard verein deutscher ingenieure 2010 this inverse method has the advantage of yielding heat transport parameters at the field scale and is therefore not influenced by e g liner retrieval or repacking this method could not be used for the aquifer and the lower aquitard as no discernible seasonal temperature variations occur at this depth and the assumption of purely conductive heat transport does not hold in the aquifer as no sediment material was available for the lower aquitard the thermal parameters were assumed to be equal to those of the upper aquitard 4 results 4 1 isothermal hydraulics the model was tested before simulating the transient heat injection test using the isothermal multi level pumping tests at the three depths at well nmr04 prior to heat injection these pumping tests were also used to estimate the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and the anisotropy factor as well as the specific storage at the spatial scale of the field site see section 3 the measured pumping rates were applied as neumann boundary conditions to the corresponding screen sections of nmr04 and an isothermal transient simulation of groundwater flow was performed to obtain simulated drawdowns at the observation points fig 5 compares the simulated results and measured drawdown curves from pumping tests 9 m to 10 m at observation well w2 2z u01 in general a good correspondence of the measured and simulated curves was found as the model reproduces the maximum drawdown and the time behavior of the three drawdown curves the model also correctly distinguishes between the large depth at 13 5 m where drawdown is smaller and the shallower depths at 7 5 m and 10 5 m which exhibit nearly identical drawdown curves these different drawdowns are the result of aquifer anisotropy and the screen depth of the pumped section simulated drawdown deviates from the measured drawdown during early recovery after switching off the pump after 5 5 min but after 8 min it corresponds well this is due to backflow of water into the well from the pipe leading from the pump to the surface after the pump is switched off which increases the water level in the pumping well analogous to a small slug test and faster than from backflow from the aquifer only this effect is clearly seen for 1 min during which this backflow occurs while after this 1 min the natural groundwater flow dominates again and is well captured by the model the simulated drawdown in all sections at the end of the pumping period is slightly lower than the measured drawdown and is slightly more pronounced at the depth of 13 5 m the agreement between measured and simulated data shown in fig 5 is representative for all observation wells of this pumping test and also for the pumping tests conducted in the other screen sections of well nmr04 the effect of measured drawdown being slightly higher than modeled drawdown at the end of the pumping period indicates a local hydraulic conductivity reduction in the aquifer section close to well nmr04 the low deviation shows that the aquifer is only slightly heterogeneous as clear from the range of hydraulic conductivities reported in table 1 capturing these small variations in a numerical model would require very detailed and small scale experimental characterization of the 3d heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity for the field site i e multiple pumping tests at varying depths the aquifer is parameterized using homogeneous and anisotropic hydraulic conductivity due to the low variation in hydraulic conductivity and anisotropy factors in the pumping tests the ability of the numerical model to simulate the measured drawdown curves with good overall agreement shows that aquifer parameterization in terms of hydraulic conductivity anisotropy ratio specific storage hydrogeologic setup and the applied boundary conditions are adequate for simulating the induced isothermal groundwater flow in the aquifer at the field site 4 2 heat injection test the heat injection test was simulated by applying the well flow rate and injection temperature as shown in fig 3 and performing a transient non isothermal coupled simulation of groundwater flow and heat transport as outlined in section 3 1 and parameterized as shown in section 3 the model was used to predict subsurface temperatures and the heat transport processes induced by the heat injection fig 6 displays the simulated temperatures at five specific times 29th and 31st may 5th and 19th june and 7th july each at 7 pm after the end of heat injection using both a horizontal plane and a vertical transect through the model area fig 6 is used to illustrate the general behavior while figs 7 9 show a detailed comparison of measured temperatures and temperatures predicted by the numerical model the horizontal transects taken at 7 5 m from the top of the aquifer show that the heat in the aquifer at the end of the injection is distributed radially around the injection well fig 6a heat transport is dominated by advection due to the water injection superseding transport by the natural groundwater flow due to the low natural flow velocities simulated temperatures 60 c are restricted to a distance of 1 51 m from the injection well and temperatures 40 c to 2 58 m the 11 c temperature isoline indicating a temperature increase of 1 8 c above the initial aquifer temperature well above the 1 c measurement accuracy is at a distance of approximately 4 50 m from the injection well at 7 5 m depth the vertical transect at the end of heat injection shows high simulated temperatures 60 c close to the injection well at a distance of 0 19 m at all depths for distances further from the injection well temperatures are higher in the upper part than in the lower part temperatures 40 c for example are found up to a distance of 2 58 m at a depth of 7 5 m but only up to distances of 0 67 m at a depth of 13 5 m which leads to a tilting of the temperature isolines the 11 c isoline of simulated temperature shows corresponding distances of 4 50 m and 3 42 m temperature changes occur in both the lower and upper aquitards via heat conduction from the aquifer to the aquitards although heat is injected only into the aquifer through the screened well section this effect is more pronounced for the upper aquitard because simulated temperatures are higher in the upper part of the aquifer following the injection heat transport is governed primarily by conduction while the influence of heat advection from natural groundwater flow is only minor the simulation shows that the high temperatures near the injection well have already decreased to 62 c two days after the heat injection ended fig 6b and to 49 c seven days after the injection ended simulated temperatures decrease to 31 c after three weeks while after 10 weeks temperatures are only 17 c as heat moves away from the injection well by heat conduction temperatures further from the well and the size of the heat plume increase the distance of the 11 c isoline at 7 5 m depth increases to 10 43 m after 10 weeks the center of the simulated heat plume moves downstream in the direction of groundwater flow i e from north east to south west having travelled about 2 14 m in the 10 weeks after the injection ends fig 6e this decrease in the simulated temperature at the injection well and the spread of heat away from the well is also clear in the vertical cross section where heat is also spreading to the aquitards due to the higher temperatures in the upper part of the aquifer the 15 c isoline of simulated temperatures has spread about 1 18 m into the upper aquitard but only 0 36 m into the lower aquitard after the end of injection the higher heat accumulation at the aquifer top compared to the aquifer bottom as shown by the numerical model is present at the end of the injection but increases further over time the vertical tilt of the heat plume at the top of the aquifer is due to the induced thermal convection in the model the density difference between the hot injected water and the cool ambient groundwater causes the hot water to rise and collect at the top of the aquifer this buoyancy flow induces a vertical redistribution of the injected hot water near the injection well and enhances the spread of the hot water at the upper part of the aquifer away from the injection well the density driven flow does not stop when the injection is over but continues as long as a temperature difference and thus a density difference remains in the aquifer the induced thermal convection also causes a stronger conductive heat transfer towards the upper aquitard compared to the lower aquitard in the long term in the vertical transects of fig 6 the effect of seasonal change on land surface temperature at the upper model boundary becomes more obvious as temperatures in the upper few meters increase in june and then decrease again in august interfering with the heat transported upwards from the aquifer through the upper aquitard also advective transport of heat due to the ambient groundwater flow which is from right to left in the vertical transects can be clearly seen by the growing shift between the location of the injection well and the center of the heat plume fig 7 shows the simulated and measured temperature curves at different depths within the aquifer for the cm wells i e at a distance of 3 1 m from the injection well measured temperatures first increase quickly at all depths and monitoring locations due to the injection with a subsequent cooling at depths of 6 5 m and 7 5 m the maximum temperature occurs within seven days from the end of the injection but only after two weeks for 9 m and 13 5 m and the maximum temperatures are lower at the end of the observation phase about four months after the heat injection the measured temperatures of all sensors have not returned to the initial temperature the initial rapid increase in the measured temperature is caused by the hot water injection into the aquifer and the forced advection dominated heat transport the cooling phase only slowly reduces the temperature due to the conduction dominated heat transport away from the center of the heat plume following the outward temperature gradients advective transport of heat with natural groundwater flow does not lower temperatures quickly due to the low natural flow velocities at the site the highest temperatures measured at depths of 6 5 m and 7 5 m were 47 c and 41 c respectively a maximum temperature of 24 c was observed at 9 m while close to the bottom of the aquifer at 13 5 m the maximum measured temperature was only 14 c this shows that the measured temperatures near the top of the aquifer are about 30 c higher than those near the aquifer bottom although at the same distance from the injection well this temperature distribution is consistent with the temperature distribution predicted by the model as shown in the vertical cross sections of fig 6 due to the high temperature differences and the high hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer thermal convection may be induced which leads to this tilted vertical temperature distribution fig 7 shows that wells of the same depth do not show the same measured peak temperature measured peak temperatures at 9 m in wells w2 ml d03 and w2 ml d04 are significantly higher than in wells w2 ml c04 and w2 ml c08 24 c versus 20 c respectively this effect is also observed at 7 5 m and 13 5 m and can be explained by ambient groundwater flow shifting the center of the heat plume downstream along the flow direction i e towards wells w2 ml d03 and w2 ml d04 see fig 1 for position of wells at a depth of 6 5 m however well w2 ml c04 shows the highest temperature 47 c which cannot be explained by ambient groundwater flow since this well is positioned perpendicular to the groundwater flow direction from the injection well furthermore the downstream well w2 ml d03 shows significantly higher peak temperatures 43 c than the other downstream well w2 ml d04 34 c these observations indicate a heterogeneous distribution of aquifer hydraulic conductivity in the upper part of the aquifer with a higher hydraulic conductivity to the west of the injection well causing advective heat transport to deviate locally in the upper part of the aquifer from the large scale flow direction the comparison of simulated temperatures from the predictive model to the measured temperatures shows that the relatively fast rise and the slow decrease of temperatures as seen in the measured data at all wells is also captured by the model the initial temperature increase shortly after the end of the injection is generally well predicted by the model as is the time of the peak temperature while the maximum temperature is not predicted accurately in all cases for the long term development the agreement between the measured and the predicted temperatures is good the numerical model is thus suitable to accurately predict the time behavior and the long term temperatures showing that the model is able to well predict the general thermal behavior of the experiment however some discrepancies between predicted and measured peak temperatures occur these are highly influenced by the local heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity and by the strength of induced convection the simulated peak temperatures of the downstream wells at 7 5 m w2 ml d03 and w2 ml d04 were 34 c to 36 c respectively higher than those of the wells positioned transverse to the flow direction w2 ml c04 and w2 ml c08 25 c to 27 c respectively similar effects are observed at depths of 6 5 m 9 m and 13 5 m thus the influence of the ambient groundwater flow as observed in the measured data is captured by the model which stresses the relevance of including natural groundwater flow in predictive simulations even at the low flow rates found at the field site the measured order of maximum temperatures at 6 5 m which is caused by local aquifer heterogeneity cannot be captured by a model using homogeneous hydraulic aquifer properties thus some discrepancies between the temperatures predicted by a homogeneous model and the measured temperatures are expected however the agreement between measured and predicted temperatures is good for the long term temperature evolution the larger the mismatch between predicted and measured peak temperature the longer this mismatch is present until it is dampened by heat conduction this shows that for this heat injection experiment the influence of hydraulic heterogeneity during the injection phase on the long term temperature evolution is less important than the correct representation of heat conduction which governs the long term temperature evolution fig 8 shows the results of the ci wells 1 2 m from the injection well the principal behavior with a fast temperature increase due to the advection dominated heat transport and a slower subsequent conduction dominated cooling phase is the same as for the cm wells the temperature peaks occur within three days 27th to 29th may for all depths and measuring locations significantly earlier than the cm wells from 31st may to approximately 15th june the thermal behavior is more advection dominated at the ci wells than for the cm wells which is in accordance with the smaller distance of the ci wells to the injection well the distinct influence of advective heat transport also explains the higher peak temperatures compared to the cm wells at 7 5 m for example a maximum peak temperature of 73 c was measured for the ci wells but only 41 c for the cm wells and at 13 5 m the maximum temperatures were 67 c and 14 c respectively consequently the range in observed peak temperatures was higher at the ci wells than at the cm wells at all depths comparison of peak temperatures of the different wells at e g 6 5 m reveals a difference of 21 c between the highest peak temperature of 65 c at well w2 ml d01 and the lowest peak temperature of 44 c at well w2 ml c07 this could be due to variation in the distances of the ci wells to the injection well see fig 1a which is up to 0 26 m or because of the heterogeneous distribution of hydraulic conductivity which causes an unequal spatial intensity of advective heat transport examination of the cooling phases in fig 8 shows that cooling is faster in the lower parts of the aquifer for example at 6 5 m and 7 5 m temperatures at all wells have decreased to 20 c within 52 days of the injection ending while this decrease occurs in only 41 days and 5 days at depths of 9 m and 13 5 m respectively this indicates an ongoing transfer of heat from the lower to the upper part of the aquifer after the heat injection has stopped which can be explained by thermally induced convection the comparison of predicted and measured temperatures shows that the overall thermal behavior is captured well similar to the cm wells with accuracy being lower for the peak temperatures and higher for the long term temperature evolution larger discrepancies between predicted and measured peak temperatures occur because of the more pronounced advective heat transport at the ci wells compared to the cm wells thus all predicted peak temperatures for one depth are identical in the model approximately matching the average measured peak temperature for the locations where peak temperatures are well matched by the model the temperature decrease is also predicted correctly showing that the relative contributions of advective and conductive heat transport to total heat transport are correctly represented by the model using the derived thermal and hydraulic parameters fig 9 displays the measured temperatures and the temperatures from the predictive model for the co wells 6 5 m from the injection well a similar behavior of the measured temperatures is observed as for the cm and ci results in general i e a temperature increase followed by a temperature decrease however the maximum measured temperature is much lower 15 c co compared to 47 c cm so that the peak is also much less defined the temperature peaks also arrive later at the co wells compared to the cm wells for instance at 7 5 m the temperature peak occurs around three days after the end of the injection for the cm wells and only after 54 days for the co wells the temporal behavior of the temperature increase also differs as with the cm wells a fast temperature rise is followed by a slow cooling phase while for the co wells a much slower temperature rise and temperature decrease is observed these differences are due to the larger distance of the co wells to the injection well the co wells are not directly influenced by advective heat input into the aquifer by the hot water injection instead the thermal signal is caused by conductive heat transport due to the induced temperature gradients these are lower farther away from the injection well therefore a slower reaction to the heat injection occurs at the co wells fig 9 shows that the downstream wells w2 ml d08 w2 2z d09 and w2 ml d10 have significantly higher peak temperatures approximately 15 c in 7 5 m than well w2 2z c10 approximately 12 c in 7 5 m which is positioned perpendicular to the ambient groundwater flow direction this difference is due to the transport of heat with the ambient groundwater flow in the direction of the downstream wells as was observed for the cm wells in fig 7 the predicted temperature curves generally agree well with the measured data indicating a good capability of the model for simulating thermal heat flow at a greater distance from the heat injection well in addition the distinction between the wells showing more pronounced temperature increases i e w2 ml d08 w2 2z d09 and w2 ml d10 due to the larger influence of the ambient groundwater flow and the smaller temperature change at well w2 2z c10 is also correctly predicted by the model this shows as for the cm wells that ambient the groundwater flow velocity was parameterized correctly using the approach outlined in section 3 3 being suitable for predicting longer term temperature changes at greater distances from the injection well starting at the beginning of september i e three months after the end of the heat injection test simulated and measured temperatures start to deviate for the downstream wells w2 ml d08 w2 2z d09 and w2 ml d10 in the upper section of the aquifer at 6 5 m and 7 5 m this deviation of 1 2 c is considered small in the context of the heat injection experiment that is also seen in the cm wells however due to the larger overall temperature change at these wells it is less obvious in fig 7 possible reasons for this deviation may be an overestimation of the vertical upward heat transfer thus lowering the simulated temperatures in the upper part of the aquifer or an underestimation of the influence of the seasonally increasing land surface temperatures 5 discussion the aim of this work was to evaluate the predictive capability of a detailed site investigation in combination with process oriented numerical forward modeling for a high temperature 74 c heat injection into a near surface confined aquifer the parameters estimated for the field site prior to the heat injection test were used in a numerical forward model to predict the spatial and temporal temperature development resulting from the heat injection this temperature distribution was assessed by comparison to high resolution temperature data measured at the heat injection site no inverse modeling or parameter fitting efforts were undertaken in order to assess the suitability of the field investigation methods and the numerical model 5 1 quality of the prediction model overall the predicted and measured temperatures showed good agreement the trends in temperature as well as their spatial dependence and time behavior were predicted correctly the predicted and measured peak temperatures exhibited the greatest differences the average difference was 3 8 c which corresponds to only 5 of the induced temperature 65 c however a maximum deviation of 30 9 c was found close to the injection well where advective heat transport is dominant and temperature is most strongly influenced by small scale heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity the majority of peak temperatures 75 were predicted to within 3 4 c which corresponds to about 5 of the induced temperature signal the prediction of long term thermal impacts was more accurate four months after the injection the average difference between predicted and measured temperatures was 0 73 c which corresponds to 12 of the remaining temperature change i e the highest measured temperature at that time relative to the initial aquifer temperature the maximum temperature difference was 1 87 c 30 of the remaining change the majority of peak temperatures 75 were predicted to within 1 0 c 16 of the remaining change demonstrating that the long term temperature evolution which is mainly governed by heat conduction was well represented in ht ates applications the model is thus suitable for predicting the long term thermal impacts on the aquifer the less accurate peak temperature predictions would mainly affect the storage operation i e return flow temperatures but not the thermal impacts the numerical prediction model opengeosys used here adequately represents the governing heat transport mechanisms i e heat conduction heat advection and induced heat convection as well as their relative contributions to the total heat flow and the resulting temperature distribution these mechanisms depend on the distance to the injection well the time since the injection local temperature gradients and ambient groundwater flow velocity in combination with site specific hydraulic and thermal parameters as demonstrated during mesh generation the ability to assign flexible mesh element sizes to accurately represent the geometric set up is useful as this enables the construction of computational meshes with a high resolution at and near the injection well while restricting the total number of elements to provide a more quantitative measure of the model s predictive capability than a visual comparison of temperature curves and peak temperatures a number of model metrics were calculated and evaluated these were calculated for all available wells within 6 6 m of the injection well at depths of 4 m to 13 5 m as temperatures at these locations changed significantly during the heat injection test the nash sutcliff model efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 a measure of the agreement between observed and predicted data relative to the average of all observations as a prediction yields a value of 0 74 this is a satisfactory prediction according to motovilov et al 1999 or a good prediction according to saleh et al 2000 an nse based on the logarithmic values of the observed and predicted temperatures ln nse 0 80 krause et al 2005 or the absolute instead of the squared differences mod nse 0 58 krause et al 2005 yields similar values ln nse is larger than the nse demonstrating that long term effects are better captured saleh et al 2000 additionally the mean average error mae and the normalized mean average error nmae which normalizes the mae to the temperature change for each measurement location janssen and heuberger 1995 were calculated as mae 0 9 c and nmae 13 4 these metrics are consistent with each other and correspond well to the visual comparison described above reflecting the same prediction quality 5 2 parameterization a prerequisite for a quantitative and accurate representation of the heat transport processes is an adequate quantification of field site and heat transport parameters discrepancies between predicted and measured peak temperatures can be ascribed to the small scale heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity the site investigation showed low spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity therefore the greatest effect on temperature curves mainly occurs at peak temperatures but not on longer term trends which are governed by heat conduction homogeneous hydraulic conductivity was estimated from the multi level pumping test consequently only the average behavior was captured in the model which was sufficiently representative for the field experiment improved hydraulic characterization that provides spatially highly resolved hydraulic conductivity measurements especially close to the injection well could improve predictions of the peak arrival this may be valuable for larger scale ates applications for example where the absolute scale of investigation is larger than the meter scale experiment presented here also due to the repeated injection and extraction cycles of most ates systems advective heat flow would dominate throughout an ates operation while in this study it only dominated in the initial seven day phase of the heat injection experiment thermal parameters were correctly quantified using the methods in this work as demonstrated by the accurate prediction of the long term temperature evolution and the correct shape of the temperature curves variability of these parameters as determined from the field is quite low and suitable investigation methods as described in section 3 can be used to obtain reliable estimates although the spatial scale of the heat plume was small thermal convection was identified as a significant heat transport mechanism for longer term temperature development the rayleigh number ra determined for the numerical model parameters was 12 5 indicating that mixed convection rather than free convection was occurring schout et al 2014 i e thermal convection was not the dominant heat transfer process but it has a significant influence on the resulting temperature distribution therefore in addition to employing the numerical model in a purely predictive mode it was also used to determine the sensitivity of the predicted temperatures on the anisotropy ratio to quantify the predictive uncertainty by varying the anisotropy ratio from 2 39 to 1 and 5 corresponding to ra of 29 9 and 6 0 respectively the nmae increases from 13 4 to 16 0 and 22 0 respectively accordingly a similar but slightly inferior model fit can be achieved using a smaller anisotropy ratio which corresponds to a higher vertical hydraulic conductivity and thus to increased thermal convection with the larger anisotropy ratio of 5 the discrepancy between predicted and measured temperatures increases significantly as thermally induced convection is dampened temperature distribution is therefore sensitive to the anisotropy ratio if the vertical hydraulic conductivity becomes low enough to significantly impair thermally induced convection this also demonstrates that since using 10 as a typical anisotropy ratio estimate would lead to inaccurate predictions this parameter therefore needs to be determined for each individual site the method of depth oriented multilevel pumping tests combined with an analytical solution provides a reliable estimate as shown by the good correspondence of predicted and measured temperatures using the parameterization of table 1 the advantage of this method is that anisotropy can be characterized on the scale of the heat plume in contrast to flow logs taken at the injection well that only characterize the direct surroundings of the injection well and may not be representative of the heat injection experiment a requirement of this is that the pumping and observation wells are suitably located to be representative of the whole field site groundwater flow velocity va was varied from 0 07 m d to 0 05 m d and 0 09 m d which are the average minimum and maximum values obtained from the field site parameterization table 1 the model fit is worse than for the prediction scenario for both lower nmae 14 2 and higher nmae 16 6 va indicating a good model parameterization of the groundwater flow velocity differences were only discernible at larger downstream distances as the maximum change in predicted temperature of 1 c is more significant there natural groundwater flow velocity must be estimated accurately when planning an ates system because it reduces ates efficiency by downstream heat losses even if dampened by thermal retardation a thermal velocity of 0 03 m d can be obtained from the simulation results of the thermal plume development when considering the position of the center of the heat plume 10 weeks after the injection ends this translates into a thermal retardation factor of 2 33 when considering the groundwater flow velocity of 0 07 m d the thermal retardation factor calculated from the aquifer parameters measured from aquifer samples was 1 90 which would result in a slightly higher thermal velocity of 0 04 m d this small difference mainly represents the measurement resolution considering the uncertainties in the estimation of the plume center position and the fact that laboratory measurements of thermal parameters yield only a local value of the thermal retardation factor dispersivity is required by the numerical model but it is difficult to obtain by field measurements and could only be inferred from dedicated thermal field experiments park et al 2015 this method requires fitting to measured temperature data which cannot be performed prior to the injection for the construction of a predictive model however a sensitivity analysis shows that reducing both longitudinal and transverse dispersivity from 0 1 m to 0 01 m causes distinct changes to predicted temperatures in the upper part of the aquifer close to the injection well of up to 10 c due to the reduced mixing at lower dispersivity the buoyancy flow intensity increases which causes a slightly stronger tilting of the heat plume the dispersivity is only sensitive close to the injection well and only during injection of the hot water since the high flow velocities from the injection result in a large contribution of dispersion to overall heat transport using a higher dispersivity value has the opposite effect of reducing thermal convection therefore some ambiguity exists as dispersivity and vertical hydraulic conductivity both influence induced convection this can be resolved by a reliable determination of the anisotropy ratio and emphasizes the need for a reliable estimate of the vertical hydraulic conductivity in practical heat storage applications additional data can be obtained by monitoring in this work a purely predictive approach based on parameters obtained prior to the heat injection was used this data could be used i e by applying inverse modeling or model calibration to better constrain the model and improve predictions accordingly the applied model metrics are also beneficial for that and this work presents a valuable parameterization basis for the initial model 5 3 comparison with other studies this work shows that depth specific pumping tests with depth dependent drawdown measurements are suitable for characterizing the hydraulic parameters including vertical hydraulic conductivity this is in accordance with the pioneering work of parr et al 1983 that applied a single depth dependent test during well installation to derive this parameter on a larger spatial scale and for a larger experimental setting the findings presented here show that an approach using more pumping depths and observation points is also suitable on a smaller scale heat capacity and thermal conductivity values were based on direct measurements of sediment samples in this study while this is the preferred method sediment samples are not necessarily available at all sites parr et al 1983 and bridger and allen 2014 achieved sufficient accuracy by using correlations with indirect measurements of porosity and sediment composition which may be used if direct measurements are not available other methods involve the thermal parameterization from geophysical well logs grain size data and porosity via empirical relations visser et al 2015 and from combined solute thermal tracer tests wildemeersch et al 2014 while the first method has the advantage of providing highly resolved vertical profiles of thermal parameters at the logged wells the second approach can provide representative values at the field scale both methods however are relatively sophisticated and consequently laborious and costly for the field site in this study thermal parameterization by direct measurements was deemed the most appropriate method in line with the results of vandenbohede et al 2011 who modeled a shallow heat injection test for parameter inversion the parameters of conductive transport were determined more reliably than those regarding advective transport the aquifer used for heat injection was relatively homogeneous and showed no strong sedimentological or hydraulic substructures therefore a thermally and hydraulically homogeneous aquifer parameterization could be employed molson et al 1992 also used a homogeneous model to simulate subsurface temperatures following a heat injection test with high accuracy compared to the observed field temperature however contrary to the present study molson et al 1992 calibrated the ground surface heat transfer coefficient and the unfrozen moisture relationship to match the observed temperatures their model is thus not a purely predictive model while this study shows that the applied site investigation is suitable for a predictive simulation ganguly et al 2017 and buscheck et al 1983 also used homogeneous models to simulate ates experiments and concluded that they could predict the average temperature distribution without the preferential movement of heat caused by a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity distribution their finding is corroborated by this work for a heat injection test in a near surface aquifer visser et al 2015 and bridger and allen 2014 examined the influence of heterogeneity on the thermal impact for the simulation of lt ates systems and found that the maximum horizontal thermal plume extent and the maximum simulated temperature would be underestimated by a homogeneous model this was explained by preferential heat transport along high hydraulic conductivity layers and the subsequent focusing of heat their findings show that calibrating a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity could allow for a better fit of the maximum temperatures and a better representation of the spread of these maximum temperatures at the individual monitoring positions on the other hand visser et al 2015 stated that both homogeneous and heterogeneous models realistically simulated the actual temperatures furthermore bridger and allen 2010 conclude from a lt ates simulation study using a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity distribution that in most cases homogeneous approaches are sufficient to reproduce the system behavior while heterogeneous approaches can result in model uncertainties as large as for more simplified models consequently the homogeneous approach employed in this study is considered satisfactory in terms of the results with the least effort in parameterization in addition to the sensitivity of the horizontal hydraulic conductivity distribution on the thermal plume shape bridger and allen 2014 found that besides dispersivity simulated temperatures were most sensitive to the anisotropy even for a lt ates system this result is corroborated by this work with the sensitivity to the anisotropy being even more pronounced due to the significantly higher injection temperature applied here together with the observed temperature distributions this indicates the presence of buoyancy flow in the experiment which has also been observed in field experiments by e g molz et al 1983 and palmer et al 1992 miller and delin 2002 and delin et al 2002 however found only minimal buoyancy flow in their experiments despite high injection temperatures of 88 c to 118 c this could be because of the insensitivity of the monitoring network to this process or thin low permeable layers within the sandstone aquifer this demonstrates the importance of site specific parameter investigation to reliably predict thermal impacts for ht ates plants gossler et al 2019 investigated thermal retardation in 1d laboratory experiments and found that the thermal retardation factor calculated from the material properties compared well to the experimentally observed value and no significant thermal non equilibrium effects appeared this is corroborated in this study for a field experiment at a larger scale the assignment of a temperature profile as the initial condition for the whole model domain as in this study is clearly preferable over using a constant initial temperature this has also been used by e g collignon et al 2020 kim et al 2010 and molson et al 1992 this requires measuring a vertical profile over a longer time period to understand the temporal dynamics in addition to vertically differing temperatures visser et al 2015 reported a lateral variation in temperature distribution due to the presence of buildings at their site in the present study only insignificant lateral temperature variations were found but variations would have been detected by the experimental setup and could have been included in the numerical prediction model 6 conclusions a shallow heat injection test was conducted with an injection of 74 c water into an aquifer for 4 5 days the hydraulic and thermal properties of the aquifer were investigated prior to the heat injection test and a predictive high resolution numerical simulation of the coupled thermo hydraulic processes was performed based on these parameters the comparison of the predicted spatial and temporal temperature distributions to the measured temperatures showed good agreement conclusions from this work are as follows the numerical process model parameterized based on a priori site investigation data could accurately predict the overall thermal behavior induced by the heat injection test the intensity of the heat transport processes particularly advective and conductive heat transport as well as temperature induced convection is correctly simulated the model prediction has a high accuracy especially for long term and far field temperature evolution which is crucial for assessing the thermal impact on the aquifer the accuracy of predicted temperatures is lower for the temperature peaks close to the injection well as these are most influenced by the heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity which is not represented in the homogeneous model the vertical temperature distribution is sensitive to the vertical hydraulic conductivity which determines the intensity of buoyancy flow depth oriented multi level pumping tests enable a reliable estimation of both the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer the numerical process model described in this work is suitable for designing ht ates systems in regard to thermal and hydraulic processes and for assessing the induced thermal impacts

4633,predicting the fate and transport of contaminants in a subsurface environment is essential to the evaluation and remediation of soil and groundwater pollution point source models have been widely used to describe the accidental leakage of contaminants and the intended injection of chemicals but previous researches are limited to a single source in an infinite semi finite domain with oversimplified injection types thus this study establishes a two dimensional analytical model for contaminant transport involving advection dispersion sorption and degradation in a finite domain with multiple arbitrary time dependent point sources four representative time dependent sources are applied to study the transport behavior of contaminants in a more realistic environment results reveal that assuming multiple sources as an equivalent intensity single point source would significantly undervalue the polluted range by 17 7 in the early stage but overvalue the maximum downstream concentration when the sources are spaced at an interval larger than 1 m an infinite effluent boundary assumption would cause a noticeable deviation in the concentration near a real finite border especially in a dispersion dominated migration system moreover a larger decay coefficient for decay injection will linearly reduce the area of contaminated region while a larger injection rate for finite pulse injection will logarithmically expand the contaminated region thus close attention should be paid to the time dependent characteristics of point sources in practice to facilitate soil and groundwater remediation and the present model is a promising tool to address this issue keywords contaminant migration multiple point sources time dependent injection finite domain 1 introduction fate and transport of contaminants such as leachate pesticide and radioactive chemicals in the subsurface environment is a substantial issue that generates social concern the issue is complicated due to the diversity and uncertainty in the contaminant type contaminant quantity and geological condition great efforts have been made by previous scholars in developing various numerical models begnudelli and sanders 2006 geiger et al 2004 nazir et al 2016 or analytical models chen et al 2016a 2016b gao et al 2013 rowe and booker 1985 yates 2009 for the evaluation and prediction of contaminant migration behavior this study emphasizes on analytical methods because they can reveal the basic mechanism of contaminant migration and have a higher computational efficiency of analyzing numerous scenarios for the development of design methods than numerical methods various types of subsurface contaminant sources have been considered in the previous analytical models including point sources line sources and plane sources line or plane sources are generally modeled as a boundary condition of a studied area to reflect the intrusion of contaminated plume and or saltwater chen et al 2011 fahs et al 2018 latinopoulos et al 1988 rowe and booker 1985 internal point sources are applied to model the common leakage of underground storage tanks sewer lines and or oil pipes and the in situ point injection of pesticides and or tracer in practice armon and hänninen 2015 liang et al 2016 yates 2009 in fact a line and or a plane source at the boundary are degenerated from an internal point source neglecting the contaminant migration from the point source to line plane boundary hence point contaminant source models have broad applicability incorporating a continuous or instantaneous point source basha and el habel 1993 developed a one dimensional 1d advection dispersion analytical solution this solution was extended to a two dimensional 2d infinite domain by aral and liao 1996 and yadav and jaiswal 2011 to consider both longitudinal and transverse dispersions however a subsurface aquifer is of finite thickness in practice thus chen et al 2016b and singh et al 2020 proposed a semi infinite domain model subjected to an instantaneous and a constant concentration point source respectively an instantaneous point source analytical model in a semi infinite domain has been successfully applied to the prediction of contaminant concentration in wetlands fu et al 2016 and open channel flow guo et al 2018 all the current models introduced above were subjected to a single point source however multi point leak has been widely observed in fields such as the leakages of sewage leachate and oil from multiple holes and or defects on a pipeline a landfill liner and a storage tank respectively chang and lin 2006 chen et al 2009 feng et al 2019 guan 2014 nordbotten et al 2009 rowe 2012 rowe and yu 2019 xie 2009 2016 xie et al 2010 zhan et al 2014a b stampolidis et al 2003 moreover these single point sources were generally assumed as a continuous constant rate injection or a simple instantaneous injection which cannot describe the complicated time variant injection scenarios such as the leakage of fixed mass contaminants with decay and degradation pruess et al 2002 additionally the widely adopted infinite effluent boundary cannot properly model a finite domain bounded by a barrier system ding et al 2020 peng et al 2020 therefore multiple point sources time dependent injection and finite effluent boundary are three important factors that have been rarely addressed by previous point source models to the best of the authors knowledge but play important roles in predicting the migration behavior of contaminants in the subsurface the purpose of this paper is to develop a general approach for analytically solving a two dimensional contaminant transport model in a finite domain with multiple time dependent point sources using this model the interaction between multiple point sources the time dependent characteristics for point sources and the reasonability of infinite effluent boundary will be studied 2 mathematical model 2 1 governing equation and

the first order degradation decay constant and qi j t δ x xij δ z zij represents the leakage of an idealized point pollution source as a function equals to zero everywhere except for xij zij and whose

medium as follows shackelford and daniel 1991 2 d x d d mx d z d d mz for the l wide and h deep finite subsurface area shown in fig 1 its upper boundary z 0 and the bottom boundary z h were set as zero mass flux that suppose the liquid phase contaminants can hardly enter the vadose zone through the upper surface of an aquifer and or penetrate a low permeability aquitard ding et al 2020 the left zero gradient boundary x 0 was also adopted because the upstream contaminant transport against the groundwater flow can be neglected singh et al 2020 the right boundary x l have two options for different scenarios in the downstream a zero concentration condition eq 7 for a river or stream with flushing effect rabideau and khandelwal 1998 and a zero gradient boundary condition eq 8 for an

method for the coupled advection dispersion sorption degradation equation with multiple arbitrary time dependent point sources in eq 1 the method includes three steps step 1 apply the laplace

numerical inversion method is required to obtain the solutions in original domain and this study adopts the talbot s inversion algorithm talbot 1979 which is a great tool for handling solute transport problems recommended by wang et al 2015 3 verification for representative time dependent point sources this section compares four types of time dependent point pollution sources to examine the correctness of the proposed solution that is instantaneous injection finite pulse injection decay injection and coupled injection the definitions and specific conditions of these four pollution types are introduced in the following scenario 1 instantaneous injection pesticides and or tracers are generally injected into soil within a short time and in such a circumstance the pollution source can be modeled by an instantaneous injection function that is a fixed injected mass at one moment liang et al 2016 yates 2009 30 q 1 j t m j δ t t 0 j where mj ml 1 is the injected mass of the j th point source and δ t t 0 j t 1 is a dirac delta function where t 0 j t denotes the injection moment scenario 2 finite pulse injection to describe a certain amount of chemicals and or sewage accidently leaking from storage tanks and or pipes alharbi et al 2018 roehrdanz et al 2017 a finite pulse injection function is defined as 31 q 2 j t q j 0 t t f j 0 t t f j where qj ml 1t 1 is the injection rate of the j th point source and tf j t is the end time of leakage equaling to the leakage mass per meter divided by qj scenario 3 decay injection a decay injection function is defined to describe a reduced leakage rate over time regarding to landfill leachate due to falling water level and or nuclear contaminants due to radioactive decay barwick et al 1985 van genuchten 1982 as follows 32 q 3 j t q m j e λ j t where qm j ml 1t 1 is the maximum injection rate of the j th point source and λj t 1 is the corresponding decay coefficient of injection rate scenario 4 coupled instantaneous finite pulse decay injection in some complicated situations toxic chemicals might be injected and or leaked in a mode sequentially coupling instantaneous injection finite pulse injection and decay injection defined as 33 q 1 1 t m 1 δ t t 0 q 2 1 t q 1 0 t t f 0 t t f q 3 1 t q m 1 e λ 1 t the specific solutions of the above four scenarios are given in appendix a according to the general solution of eq 29 by substituting the injection function of q t q a constant into eq 29 the proposed solution can also be degenerated to a constant rate injection point source model which has been widely used in literature the transport and geometric parameters in the verification and result analysis include the average seepage velocity of v 0 1 m day park and zhan 2001 the horizontal and vertical

multiphysics 5 3 the results agree well with each other in both spatial and time domains figs 2 and 3 providing confidence in the accuracy of the developed analytical solutions 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison between mps and sps models as mentioned in the introduction a single point source model denoted as sps model is generally used in the previous studies neglecting the interaction of pollution sources however this may induce an inaccurate prediction of contaminant transport behavior thus this part compares the present multiple point source model denoted as mps model with an equivalent intensity sps model a symmetric mps model is established with two finite pulse injection point sources locating at x 11 5 m z 11 9 m and x 12 5 m z 12 11 m and having an injection rate of q 1 q 2 100 g m day for tf 1 tf 2 100 days for an equivalent intensity sps model the point source locates at x 1 5 m z 1 10 m with an injection rate of q q 1 q 2 for tf 1 100 days two adjacent point sources in the mps model result in a pollution plume in the shape of running track along the vertical direction fig 4 a while in the equivalent sps model the pollution plume is in the shape of ellipse along the horizontal direction fig 4b fig 4 does not show a phenomenon of concentration groove that appears at z 10 in fig 2 this is because this case has a smaller vertical distance between point sources 2 m than that between the left two point sources in fig 2 5 m and without the third source that is applied in the right of fig 2 the concentration distribution in the horizontal direction is more homogenous at the downstream of x 8 m mps injection induces a lower value of maximum concentration in the plume centerline z 10 m than sps injection by 0 91 g m3 due to a more uniform distribution of contaminant in the vertical direction fig 4c for example the concentration values of mps model away from the centerline at z 6 9 m and 11 14 m are larger than those of sps model at the upstream of x 2 m the concentration values are significantly smaller than those in the downstream of x 8 m but with a similar distribution with depth the upward migration of contaminant is impeded because the contaminant diffuses in the opposite direction that the ground water flows also refers to contaminant advection meanwhile the concentration differences between mps model and sps model in the upstream is also smaller thus the contaminant plume in the downstream is of higher risk and is studied in the following in general the interaction between point pollution sources can significantly affect the distribution of contaminant concentration regarding to the maximum value and influence range an accurate prediction of contaminant concentration in different profiles is of great significance for risk assessment and source inversion of a contaminated site snodgrass and kitanidis 1997 sun et al 2006 fig 5 shows the effects of the downstream distance x 5 m the relative distance between sources ds and time t on the concentration difference between mps and sps model i e δc s m large values of δc s m can be observed between z 5 15 m and x 8 m and it decreases with an increase in the distance away from pollution sources in the vertical direction and horizontal direction x fig 5a this indicates a non negligible influence of mps interaction on the prediction of contaminant concentration close to the pollution sources in which circumstance a sps model is not applicable the relative distance between pollution sources ds is another important parameter that affects the concentration distribution as ds increases from 1 m to 5 m the concentration difference δc s m becomes larger with a wider influence range and the maximum value along depth can reach up to approximately 2 1 g m3 fig 5b as time increases from 0 day to 1000 day the difference δc s m of a specific position in the downstream first increases to a peak and then gradually decreases to a stable value fig 5c thus the equivalent intensity sps model is inappropriate when multiple point sources are spaced at a large interval e g 5 m in fig 5b and or focusing on the high concentration around pollution source e g z 5 15 m and x 8 m in fig 5a and in the early stage of pollution t 400 days in fig 5c if one more point source with an injection rate q 3 100 g m day for tf 3 100 day is applied termed as the third source higher concentration can be observed at the downstream fig 6 as the distance between the third source and the calculation point increases i e x tps increases the peak concentration at x 8 m z 10 m appears earlier with a larger value therefore a two dimensional contaminant migration model with multiple point injection sources is much more reasonable in predicting the concentration distribution of contaminants in subsurface environment 4 2 assessment of the hypothesis of infinite effluent boundary this section compares the existing semi infinite domain model chen et al 2016b with the proposed finite domain model subjected to a dirichlet and neumann ebc respectively to assess the deviation caused by the hypothesis of an infinite effluent boundary condition infinite ebc the concentration deviation ratio is defined as r i d c inf c diri c diri for dirichlet ebc or r i n c inf c neum c neum for neumann ebc where c inf c diri and c neum are the concentration calculated by the semi infinite model the finite model with dirichlet ebc and the finite model with neumann ebc respectively a decay point source with an injection rate of q 3 1 exp 0 01 t is applied at x 5 m z 10 m of the studied region fig 7 presents the deviation ratio r i d of the semi infinite domain model relative to the finite domain model with dirichlet ebc at the downstream position of x 5 5 m z 10 m the deviation ratio r i d increases to a peak value and then decreases to a stable value over time as the distance between the finite effluent boundary and point source d se decreases from 6 m to 2 m the peak value of deviation ratio significantly increases from 5 to 82 this indicates that the hypothesis of infinite effluent boundary is unacceptable e g r i d larger than 5 when the effluent boundary is close to pollution source 5 m in this scenario the peak deviation ratio r i d occurs approximately around the 750th day in this scenario and the distance of finite effluent boundary to the source d se has a slight influence on the occurrence time of the r i d peak generally the hypothesis of infinite ebc would overestimate the downstream contaminant concentration of a finite domain with dirichlet ebc giving the positive deviation ratio r i d in fig 8 a this is due to the ignorance of contaminant dilution caused by river flushing at the effluent boundary however the downstream contaminant concentration of a finite domain with neumann ebc can be underestimated by the hypothesis negative r i n in fig 8b which depends on the effluent boundary source distance and contaminant migration time the zero values of r i n representing no difference between c inf and c neum are plotted in dash line in fig 8b with the underestimated zone r i n 0 on the left and the overestimated zone r i n 0 on the right for a specific value of effluent boundary source distance the underestimation of downstream concentration mainly occurs in the early stage of pollution due to the ignorance of pollution accumulation at the zero flux effluent boundary while the overestimation occurs in the later stage due to the ignorance of vertical pollution dispersion at the effluent boundary previous researchers chen et al 2012b gao et al 2013 concluded the underestimated zone caused by semi infinite models in the early stage of pollution but missed the later overestimation fig 9 shows the influence of seepage velocity v on the deviation ratio r i d and r i n at different downstream positions x 7 5 8 5 m z 10 m the absolute values of r i d and r i n both significantly increase with a decrease in seepage velocity v and an increase in downstream distance x i e moving closer to the effluent boundary this indicates that the hypothesis of infinite effluent boundary can cause a significantly large error in predicting the concentration near the effluent boundary in a dispersion dominated migration system under the same conditions the dirichlet ebc induces a larger deviation than the neumann ebc do indicating a more substantial effect of river flushing than pollution impediment overall the distance between effluent boundary and pollution source the pollution time and the seepage velocity are three important factors that determine the applicability of a semi infinite domain model in some circumstance a significant deviation in concentration prediction can lead to an inappropriate design of chemical injection and soil groundwater remediation 4 3 effect of time dependent characteristic of point sources based on the above analysis a multi point source model in a finite domain is more reasonable and is then used to study the effect of the time dependent characteristic of point pollution sources decay injection is firstly applied to simulate the decreased leachate rate of contaminants from landfill due to the implementation of pollution control measures such as the acceleration of waste degradation and the reduction of leachate level three decay sources with a maximum injection rate of qm 1 qm 2 qm 3 1 g m day and a decay coefficient λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 λ are set at x 11 5 m z 11 9 m x 12 5 m z 12 11 m and x 13 7 m z 13 10 m respectively fig 10 presents the temporal distributions of concentration at the downstream of x 12 m z 10 m for λ 10 2 5 10 3 10 3 5 10 4 10 4 and 0 day 1 for a constant rate injection scenario λ 0 that has been widely studied the downstream concentration gradually increases over time without a reduction however the concentration for λ 10 4 to 10 2 day 1 shows a significant reduction after reaching a peak value due to the downstream migration of contaminant and less contaminant supply over time at the source thus the occurrence time of peak concentration is the optimal opportunity of remediation to achieve a better performance and avoid severe pollution of downstream a larger value of decay coefficient λ results in a much smaller peak concentration occurring at an earlier time indicating the necessity of predicting the spatial and temporal concentration distributions of contaminated sites with diverse decay sources to facilitate the design of soil remediation for a fixed mass of chemical accidentally leaking from storage tanks and or pipelines a larger leakage rate indicates a shorter leakage time three finite pulse injection point sources at x 11 5 m z 11 9 m x 12 5 m z 12 11 m and x 13 7 m z 13 10 m are adopted to investigate the effect of leakage rates of a finite mass contaminant source in such circumstance fig 11 the injection rate and time of three point sources are the same i e qf 1 qf 2 qf 3 qf and tf 1 tf 2 tf 3 tf with varied values listed in fig 11 if the contaminants were injected instantaneously tf 0 day the concentration at the downstream position of x 12 m z 10 m increases to a largest peak over time at a fastest speed in fig 11 as the injection rate qf decreases together with a longer injection period the peak concentration gradually decreases but with a later occurrence time due to the leakage hysteresis at the sources for long term continuous injection of a fixed mass the breakthrough curve tends to be smooth characterized by a longer period of high concentration e g 700 1100 day for tf 1000 day the contaminated subsurface with a concentration larger than the given screening value of a specific contaminant can be defined as the contaminated region a screening value of 0 1 g m3 was adopted in this study according to the screening value of chlorobenzene given in the drinking water regulations usepa 2009 for the decay sources studied in fig 10 the area of contaminated region linearly reduces from 117 6 m2 to 74 1 m2 with the increase of decay coefficient λ from λ 0 constant rate injection to λ 0 02 day 1 fig 12 for the finite pulse sources studied in fig 11 the area value rapidly increases with an increase in the injection rate qf and eventually approaches a stable value that corresponds to an instantaneous injection source scenario fig 12 the expansion of the area of contaminated region is about 20 m2 for qf 0 2 to 0 4 g m day while for qf 1 to 2 g m day the expansion is only 4 5 m2 this indicates a more significant effect of injection rate on the area of contaminated region when the leakage rates of contaminants from fixed mass point sources are smaller to sum up it is necessary to pay close attention to the time variation characteristic of leakage and or injection point sources in the soil and groundwater remediation 5 limitation although the present model is a promising tool to evaluate the contaminant plume caused by point source leakage and then facilitate the remediation it still has several limitations one limitation is that the subsurface environment was assumed as saturated homogeneous and isotropic and cannot consider the unsaturated region caused by groundwater fluctuation and or the horizontal stratification and anisotropy characteristics due to sedimentation and consolidation of soil another limitation is that this model is suitable to describe a single component dissolved contaminant transport problem and cannot be applied to a complicated multi phase flow problem involving liquid gas and napl migration in the subsurface moreover the effects of various nonlinear sorption modes and multi stage reactions of chemical cannot be reflected since the proposed model considers the linear sorption and first order degradation of liquid phase contaminant a constant hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient was also assumed however field evidence and experimental studies indicate that the dispersion coefficient varies temporally and spatially aral and liao 1996 thus time dependent and or distance dependent dispersion coefficients can be studied in the future 6 conclusion in this study a 2d analytical model was proposed to investigate the transport of contaminant in a finite domain considering the interaction between multiple arbitrary time dependent point injection sources this model included the mechanism of transient advection dispersion sorption and degradation and was solved by a coupled approach of laplace transform finite cosine transform and variable substitution specific solutions for four representative point sources were presented and have been validated in spatial domain and time domain they were then applied to study the effects of effluent boundary condition and time dependent injection characteristics on contaminant migration behavior the main conclusions were drawn as follows 1 assuming multiple point sources as an equivalent intensity single point source would greatly overvalue the contaminant concentration near sources but undervalue the polluted range especially when point sources are spaced at an interval larger than 1 m and or the pollution is in the early stage 2 the assumption of infinite effluent boundary would overestimate the downstream contaminant concentration in a finite domain with a dirichlet effluent boundary condition ebc for a neumann ebc the assumption would result in an underestimation or overestimation in the condition of a short or long distance between effluent boundary and pollution sources 3 a semi infinite domain model infinite ebc can generate a significant deviation in the concentration near the effluent boundary depending on the distance between effluence boundary and sources the pollution time and seepage velocity to evaluate whether the outlet environment meets the standard accurately the proposed finite domain model is of great value and high demand 4 for decay point sources a larger decay coefficient of injection rate will result in a much smaller peak concentration occurring at an earlier time and meanwhile the area of contaminated region linearly reduces from 117 6 to 74 1 m2 with the increase of decay coefficient λ from 0 constant rate injection to 0 02 day 1 5 for finite pulse point sources a larger injection rate which also refers to a shorter injection period will result in a larger peak concentration occurring earlier the area of contaminated region logarithmically increases from 65 6 to 106 2 m2 with the increase of injection rate from 0 2 to 2 g m day and then approaches a stable value 108 8 m2 corresponding to an instantaneous injection source scenario credit authorship contribution statement xiang hong ding conceptualization

4633,predicting the fate and transport of contaminants in a subsurface environment is essential to the evaluation and remediation of soil and groundwater pollution point source models have been widely used to describe the accidental leakage of contaminants and the intended injection of chemicals but previous researches are limited to a single source in an infinite semi finite domain with oversimplified injection types thus this study establishes a two dimensional analytical model for contaminant transport involving advection dispersion sorption and degradation in a finite domain with multiple arbitrary time dependent point sources four representative time dependent sources are applied to study the transport behavior of contaminants in a more realistic environment results reveal that assuming multiple sources as an equivalent intensity single point source would significantly undervalue the polluted range by 17 7 in the early stage but overvalue the maximum downstream concentration when the sources are spaced at an interval larger than 1 m an infinite effluent boundary assumption would cause a noticeable deviation in the concentration near a real finite border especially in a dispersion dominated migration system moreover a larger decay coefficient for decay injection will linearly reduce the area of contaminated region while a larger injection rate for finite pulse injection will logarithmically expand the contaminated region thus close attention should be paid to the time dependent characteristics of point sources in practice to facilitate soil and groundwater remediation and the present model is a promising tool to address this issue keywords contaminant migration multiple point sources time dependent injection finite domain 1 introduction fate and transport of contaminants such as leachate pesticide and radioactive chemicals in the subsurface environment is a substantial issue that generates social concern the issue is complicated due to the diversity and uncertainty in the contaminant type contaminant quantity and geological condition great efforts have been made by previous scholars in developing various numerical models begnudelli and sanders 2006 geiger et al 2004 nazir et al 2016 or analytical models chen et al 2016a 2016b gao et al 2013 rowe and booker 1985 yates 2009 for the evaluation and prediction of contaminant migration behavior this study emphasizes on analytical methods because they can reveal the basic mechanism of contaminant migration and have a higher computational efficiency of analyzing numerous scenarios for the development of design methods than numerical methods various types of subsurface contaminant sources have been considered in the previous analytical models including point sources line sources and plane sources line or plane sources are generally modeled as a boundary condition of a studied area to reflect the intrusion of contaminated plume and or saltwater chen et al 2011 fahs et al 2018 latinopoulos et al 1988 rowe and booker 1985 internal point sources are applied to model the common leakage of underground storage tanks sewer lines and or oil pipes and the in situ point injection of pesticides and or tracer in practice armon and hänninen 2015 liang et al 2016 yates 2009 in fact a line and or a plane source at the boundary are degenerated from an internal point source neglecting the contaminant migration from the point source to line plane boundary hence point contaminant source models have broad applicability incorporating a continuous or instantaneous point source basha and el habel 1993 developed a one dimensional 1d advection dispersion analytical solution this solution was extended to a two dimensional 2d infinite domain by aral and liao 1996 and yadav and jaiswal 2011 to consider both longitudinal and transverse dispersions however a subsurface aquifer is of finite thickness in practice thus chen et al 2016b and singh et al 2020 proposed a semi infinite domain model subjected to an instantaneous and a constant concentration point source respectively an instantaneous point source analytical model in a semi infinite domain has been successfully applied to the prediction of contaminant concentration in wetlands fu et al 2016 and open channel flow guo et al 2018 all the current models introduced above were subjected to a single point source however multi point leak has been widely observed in fields such as the leakages of sewage leachate and oil from multiple holes and or defects on a pipeline a landfill liner and a storage tank respectively chang and lin 2006 chen et al 2009 feng et al 2019 guan 2014 nordbotten et al 2009 rowe 2012 rowe and yu 2019 xie 2009 2016 xie et al 2010 zhan et al 2014a b stampolidis et al 2003 moreover these single point sources were generally assumed as a continuous constant rate injection or a simple instantaneous injection which cannot describe the complicated time variant injection scenarios such as the leakage of fixed mass contaminants with decay and degradation pruess et al 2002 additionally the widely adopted infinite effluent boundary cannot properly model a finite domain bounded by a barrier system ding et al 2020 peng et al 2020 therefore multiple point sources time dependent injection and finite effluent boundary are three important factors that have been rarely addressed by previous point source models to the best of the authors knowledge but play important roles in predicting the migration behavior of contaminants in the subsurface the purpose of this paper is to develop a general approach for analytically solving a two dimensional contaminant transport model in a finite domain with multiple time dependent point sources using this model the interaction between multiple point sources the time dependent characteristics for point sources and the reasonability of infinite effluent boundary will be studied 2 mathematical model 2 1 governing equation and boundary conditions this study models a two dimensional finite subsurface domain with steady and unidirectional groundwater flow and multiple arbitrary time dependent point contaminant sources fig 1 in a 2d cartesian coordinate system of x z xij and zij are the coordinates of the j th point source of i th contaminant injection type i 1 2 3 n j 1 2 3 m using the time dependent injection function qi j t ml 1t 1 and dirac delta function δ x xij l 1 and δ z zij l 1 to describe the strength and location of point pollution sources the governing equation for contaminant advection hydrodynamic

dimensionless is the sorption retardation factor dx l2t 1 and dz l2t 1 are the horizontal and vertical hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients respectively v lt 1 is the average seepage velocity μ t 1 is the first order degradation decay constant and qi j t δ x xij δ z zij represents the leakage of an idealized point pollution source as a function equals to zero everywhere except for xij zij and whose integral over the entire spatial domain is equal to qi j t the dx and dz can be estimated by the molecular diffusion coefficient d and the mechanical dispersion coefficients dmx and dmz of a porous medium as follows shackelford and daniel 1991 2 d x d d mx d z d d mz for the l wide and h deep finite subsurface area shown in fig 1 its upper boundary z 0 and the bottom boundary z h were set as zero mass flux that suppose the liquid phase contaminants can hardly enter the vadose zone through the upper surface of an aquifer and or penetrate a low permeability aquitard ding et al 2020 the left zero gradient boundary x 0 was also adopted because the upstream contaminant transport against the groundwater flow can be neglected singh et al 2020 the right boundary x l have two options for different scenarios in the downstream a zero concentration condition eq 7 for a river or stream with flushing effect rabideau and khandelwal 1998 and a zero gradient boundary condition eq 8 for an impervious vertical barrier e g a cutoff wall ding et al 2020 xie et al 2018 yan et al 2020 eqs 7 and 8 can also be degenerated to an infinite boundary using a positive infinite width of the study area i e c x z t 0 or c x z t z 0 to describe a scenario without a stream or a barrier in the downstream most of the existing solute migration models chen et al 2016b sanskrityayn et al 2018 singh et

method for the coupled advection dispersion sorption degradation equation with multiple arbitrary time dependent point sources in eq 1 the method includes three steps step 1 apply the laplace transform and finite cosine transform techniques to the time term t and vertical distance term z of the governing equation and the boundary conditions at the top and bottom respectively giving a second order ordinary differential equation with multiple dirac delta functions step 2 introduce a new substitution variable to transform the second order non homogeneous ordinary differential

step 2 back to the original domain by performing finite cosine transform inversion and laplace transform inversion giving the general analytical solutions for the governing equation of eq 1 thus in step 1 employing the laplace transform widder 2015 of 9 c x z s l t c x z t 0 c x z t e s t d t 10 q s l t q t 0 q t e s t d t to the governing equation of eq 1 subjected to the initial condition of

numerical inversion method is required to obtain the solutions in original domain and this study adopts the talbot s inversion algorithm talbot 1979 which is a great tool for handling solute transport problems recommended by wang et al 2015 3 verification for representative time dependent point sources this section compares four types of time dependent point pollution sources to examine the correctness of the proposed solution that is instantaneous injection finite pulse injection decay injection and coupled injection the definitions and specific conditions of these four pollution types are introduced in the following scenario 1 instantaneous injection pesticides and or tracers are generally injected into soil within a short time and in such a circumstance the pollution source can be modeled by an instantaneous injection function that is a fixed injected mass at one moment liang et al 2016 yates 2009 30 q 1 j t m j δ t t 0 j where mj ml 1 is the injected mass of the j th point source and δ t t 0 j t 1 is a dirac delta function where t 0 j t denotes the injection moment scenario 2 finite pulse injection to describe a certain amount of chemicals and or sewage accidently leaking from storage tanks and or pipes alharbi et al 2018 roehrdanz et al 2017 a finite pulse injection function is defined as 31 q 2 j t q j 0 t t f j 0 t t f j where qj ml 1t 1 is the injection rate of the j th point source and tf j t is the end time of leakage equaling to the leakage mass per meter divided by qj scenario 3 decay injection a decay injection function is defined to describe a reduced leakage rate over time regarding to landfill leachate due to falling water level and or nuclear contaminants due to radioactive decay barwick et al 1985 van genuchten 1982 as follows 32 q 3 j t q m j e λ j t where qm j ml 1t 1 is the maximum injection rate of the j th point source and λj t 1 is the corresponding decay coefficient of injection rate scenario 4 coupled instantaneous finite pulse decay injection in some complicated situations toxic chemicals might be injected and or leaked in a mode sequentially coupling instantaneous injection finite pulse injection and decay injection

pollution sources at 5 m 7 5 m 5 m 12 5 m and 10 m 10 m are subjected to instantaneous injection finite pulse injection and decay injection respectively figs 2 and 3 depict the spatial contaminant concentrations and breakthrough curves of concentration for four injection scenarios respectively to allow the comparison between the proposed solutions and the finite element software comsol multiphysics 5 3 the results agree well with each other in both spatial and time domains figs 2 and 3 providing confidence in the accuracy of the developed analytical solutions 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison between mps and sps models as mentioned in the introduction a single point source model denoted as sps model is generally used in the previous studies neglecting the interaction of pollution sources however this may induce an inaccurate prediction of contaminant transport behavior thus this part compares the present multiple point source model denoted as mps model with an equivalent intensity sps model a symmetric mps model is established with two finite pulse injection point sources locating at x 11 5 m z 11 9 m and x 12 5 m z 12 11 m and having an injection rate of q 1 q 2 100 g m day for tf 1 tf 2 100 days for an equivalent intensity sps model the point source locates at x 1 5 m z 1 10 m with an injection rate of q q 1 q 2 for tf 1 100 days two adjacent point sources in the mps model result in a pollution plume in the shape of running track along the vertical direction fig 4 a while in the equivalent sps model the pollution plume is in the shape of ellipse along the horizontal direction fig 4b fig 4 does not show a phenomenon of concentration groove that appears at z 10 in fig 2 this is because this case has a smaller vertical distance between point sources 2 m than that between the left two point sources in fig 2 5 m and without the third source that is applied in the right of fig 2 the concentration distribution in the horizontal direction is more homogenous at the downstream of x 8 m mps injection induces a lower value of maximum concentration in the plume centerline z 10 m than sps injection by 0 91 g m3 due to a more uniform distribution of contaminant in the vertical direction fig 4c for example the concentration values of mps model away from the centerline at z 6 9 m and 11 14 m are larger than those of sps model at the upstream of x 2 m the concentration values are significantly smaller than those in the downstream of x 8 m but with a similar distribution with depth the upward migration of contaminant is impeded because the contaminant diffuses in the opposite direction that the ground water flows also refers to contaminant advection meanwhile the concentration differences between mps model and sps model in the upstream is also smaller thus the contaminant plume in the downstream is of higher risk and is studied in the following in general the interaction between point pollution sources can significantly affect the distribution of contaminant concentration regarding to the maximum value and influence range an accurate prediction of contaminant concentration in different profiles is of great significance for risk assessment and source inversion of a contaminated site snodgrass and kitanidis 1997 sun et al 2006 fig 5 shows the effects of the downstream distance x 5 m the relative distance between sources ds and time t on the concentration difference between mps and sps model i e δc s m large values of δc s m can be observed between z 5 15 m and x 8 m and it decreases with an increase in the distance away from pollution sources in the vertical direction and horizontal direction x fig 5a this indicates a non negligible influence of mps interaction on the prediction of contaminant concentration close to the pollution sources in which circumstance a sps model is not applicable the relative distance between pollution sources ds is another important parameter that affects the concentration distribution as ds increases from 1 m to 5 m the concentration difference δc s m becomes larger with a wider influence range and the maximum value along depth can reach up to approximately 2 1 g m3 fig 5b as time increases from 0 day to 1000 day the difference δc s m of a specific position in the downstream first increases to a peak and then gradually decreases to a stable value fig 5c thus the equivalent intensity sps model is inappropriate when multiple point sources are spaced at a large interval e g 5 m in fig 5b and or focusing on the high concentration around pollution source e g z 5 15 m and x 8 m in fig 5a and in the early stage of pollution t 400 days in fig 5c if one more point source with an injection rate q 3 100 g m day for tf 3 100 day is applied termed as the third source higher concentration can be observed at the downstream fig 6 as the distance between the third source and the calculation point increases i e x tps increases the peak concentration at x 8 m z 10 m appears earlier with a larger value therefore a two dimensional contaminant migration model with multiple point injection sources is much more reasonable in predicting the concentration distribution of contaminants in subsurface environment 4 2 assessment of the hypothesis of infinite effluent boundary this section compares the existing semi infinite domain model chen et al 2016b with the proposed finite domain model subjected to a dirichlet and neumann ebc respectively to assess the deviation caused by the hypothesis of an infinite effluent boundary condition infinite ebc the concentration deviation ratio is defined as r i d c inf c diri c diri for dirichlet ebc or r i n c inf c neum c neum for neumann ebc where c inf c diri and c neum are the concentration calculated by the semi infinite model the finite model with dirichlet ebc and the finite model with neumann ebc respectively a decay point source with an injection rate of q 3 1 exp 0 01 t is applied at x 5 m z 10 m of the studied region fig 7 presents the deviation ratio r i d of the semi infinite domain model relative to the finite domain model with dirichlet ebc at the downstream position of x 5 5 m z 10 m the deviation ratio r i d increases to a peak value and then decreases to a stable value over time as the distance between the finite effluent boundary and point source d se decreases from 6 m to 2 m the peak value of deviation ratio significantly increases from 5 to 82 this indicates that the hypothesis of infinite effluent boundary is unacceptable e g r i d larger than 5 when the effluent boundary is close to pollution source 5 m in this scenario the peak deviation ratio r i d occurs approximately around the 750th day in this scenario and the distance of finite effluent boundary to the source d se has a slight influence on the occurrence time of the r i d peak generally the hypothesis of infinite ebc would overestimate the downstream contaminant concentration of a finite domain with dirichlet ebc giving the positive deviation ratio r i d in fig 8 a this is due to the ignorance of contaminant dilution caused by river flushing at the effluent boundary however the downstream contaminant concentration of a finite domain with neumann ebc can be underestimated by the hypothesis negative r i n in fig 8b which depends on the effluent boundary source distance and contaminant migration time the zero values of r i n representing no difference between c inf and c neum are plotted in dash line in fig 8b with the underestimated zone r i n 0 on the left and the overestimated zone r i n 0 on the right for a specific value of effluent boundary source distance the underestimation of downstream concentration mainly occurs in the early stage of pollution due to the ignorance of pollution accumulation at the zero flux effluent boundary while the overestimation occurs in the later stage due to the ignorance of vertical pollution dispersion at the effluent boundary previous researchers chen et al 2012b gao et al 2013 concluded the underestimated zone caused by semi infinite models in the early stage of pollution but missed the later overestimation fig 9 shows the influence of seepage velocity v on the deviation ratio r i d and r i n at different downstream positions x 7 5 8 5 m z 10 m the absolute values of r i d and r i n both significantly increase with a decrease in seepage velocity v and an increase in downstream distance x i e moving closer to the effluent boundary this indicates that the hypothesis of infinite effluent boundary can cause a significantly large error in predicting the concentration near the effluent boundary in a dispersion dominated migration system under the same conditions the dirichlet ebc induces a larger deviation than the neumann ebc do indicating a more substantial effect of river flushing than pollution impediment overall the distance between effluent boundary and pollution source the pollution time and the seepage velocity are three important factors that determine the applicability of a semi infinite domain model in some circumstance a significant deviation in concentration prediction can lead to an inappropriate design of chemical injection and soil groundwater remediation 4 3 effect of time dependent characteristic of point sources based on the above analysis a multi point source model in a finite domain is more reasonable and is then used to study the effect of the time dependent characteristic of point pollution sources decay injection is firstly applied to simulate the decreased leachate rate of contaminants from landfill due to the implementation of pollution control measures such as the acceleration of waste degradation and the reduction of leachate level three decay sources with a maximum injection rate of qm 1 qm 2 qm 3 1 g m day and a decay coefficient λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 λ are set at x 11 5 m z 11 9 m x 12 5 m z 12 11 m and x 13 7 m z 13 10 m respectively fig 10 presents the temporal distributions of concentration at the downstream of x 12 m z 10 m for λ 10 2 5 10 3 10 3 5 10 4 10 4 and 0 day 1 for a constant rate injection scenario λ 0 that has been widely studied the downstream concentration gradually increases over time without a reduction however the concentration for λ 10 4 to 10 2 day 1 shows a significant reduction after reaching a peak value due to the downstream migration of contaminant and less contaminant supply over time at the source thus the occurrence time of peak concentration is the optimal opportunity of remediation to achieve a better performance and avoid severe pollution of downstream a larger value of decay coefficient λ results in a much smaller peak concentration occurring at an earlier time indicating the necessity of predicting the spatial and temporal concentration distributions of contaminated sites with diverse decay sources to facilitate the design of soil remediation for a fixed mass of chemical accidentally leaking from storage tanks and or pipelines a larger leakage rate indicates a shorter leakage time three finite pulse injection point sources at x 11 5 m z 11 9 m x 12 5 m z 12 11 m and x 13 7 m z 13 10 m are adopted to investigate the effect of leakage rates of a finite mass contaminant source in such circumstance fig 11 the injection rate and time of three point sources are the same i e qf 1 qf 2 qf 3 qf and tf 1 tf 2 tf 3 tf with varied values listed in fig 11 if the contaminants were injected instantaneously tf 0 day the concentration at the downstream position of x 12 m z 10 m increases to a largest peak over time at a fastest speed in fig 11 as the injection rate qf decreases together with a longer injection period the peak concentration gradually decreases but with a later occurrence time due to the leakage hysteresis at the sources for long term continuous injection of a fixed mass the breakthrough curve tends to be smooth characterized by a longer period of high concentration e g 700 1100 day for tf 1000 day the contaminated subsurface with a concentration larger than the given screening value of a specific contaminant can be defined as the contaminated region a screening value of 0 1 g m3 was adopted in this study according to the screening value of chlorobenzene given in the drinking water regulations usepa 2009 for the decay sources studied in fig 10 the area of contaminated region linearly reduces from 117 6 m2 to 74 1 m2 with the increase of decay coefficient λ from λ 0 constant rate injection to λ 0 02 day 1 fig 12 for the finite pulse sources studied in fig 11 the area value rapidly increases with an increase in the injection rate qf and eventually approaches a stable value that corresponds to an instantaneous injection source scenario fig 12 the expansion of the area of contaminated region is about 20 m2 for qf 0 2 to 0 4 g m day while for qf 1 to 2 g m day the expansion is only 4 5 m2 this indicates a more significant effect of injection rate on the area of contaminated region when the leakage rates of contaminants from fixed mass point sources are smaller to sum up it is necessary to pay close attention to the time variation characteristic of leakage and or injection point sources in the soil and groundwater remediation 5 limitation although the present model is a promising tool to evaluate the contaminant plume caused by point source leakage and then facilitate the remediation it still has several limitations one limitation is that the subsurface environment was assumed as saturated homogeneous and isotropic and cannot consider the unsaturated region caused by groundwater fluctuation and or the horizontal stratification and anisotropy characteristics due to sedimentation and consolidation of soil another limitation is that this model is suitable to describe a single component dissolved contaminant transport problem and cannot be applied to a complicated multi phase flow problem involving liquid gas and napl migration in the subsurface moreover the effects of various nonlinear sorption modes and multi stage reactions of chemical cannot be reflected since the proposed model considers the linear sorption and first order degradation of liquid phase contaminant a constant hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient was also assumed however field evidence and experimental studies indicate that the dispersion coefficient varies temporally and spatially aral and liao 1996 thus time dependent and or distance dependent dispersion coefficients can be studied in the future 6 conclusion in this study a 2d analytical model was proposed to investigate the transport of contaminant in a finite domain considering the interaction between multiple arbitrary time dependent point injection sources this model included the mechanism of transient advection dispersion sorption and degradation and was solved by a coupled approach of laplace transform finite cosine transform and variable substitution specific solutions for four representative point sources were presented and have been validated in spatial domain and time domain they were then applied to study the effects of effluent boundary condition and time dependent injection characteristics on contaminant migration behavior the main conclusions were drawn as follows 1 assuming multiple point sources as an equivalent intensity single point source would greatly overvalue the contaminant concentration near sources but undervalue the polluted range especially when point sources are spaced at an interval larger than 1 m and or the pollution is in the early stage 2 the assumption of infinite effluent boundary would overestimate the downstream contaminant concentration in a finite domain with a dirichlet effluent boundary condition ebc for a neumann ebc the assumption would result in an underestimation or overestimation in the condition of a short or long distance between effluent boundary and pollution sources 3 a semi infinite domain model infinite ebc can generate a significant deviation in the concentration near the effluent boundary depending on the distance between effluence boundary and sources the pollution time and seepage velocity to evaluate whether the outlet environment meets the standard accurately the proposed finite domain model is of great value and high demand 4 for decay point sources a larger decay coefficient of injection rate will result in a much smaller peak concentration occurring at an earlier time and meanwhile the area of contaminated region linearly reduces from 117 6 to 74 1 m2 with the increase of decay coefficient λ from 0 constant rate injection to 0 02 day 1 5 for finite pulse point sources a larger injection rate which also refers to a shorter injection period will result in a larger peak concentration occurring earlier the area of contaminated region logarithmically increases from 65 6 to 106 2 m2 with the increase of injection rate from 0 2 to 2 g m day and then approaches a stable value 108 8 m2 corresponding to an instantaneous injection source scenario credit authorship contribution statement xiang hong ding conceptualization

4634,unclogged streams are widespread in nature and can generate dynamic inverted saturated zones isz underneath the streams above the regional water tables this study is devoted to investigating the evolutional process of such an isz and its frontal movement it defines a uniform saturation zone by moving the boundary of saturation flow from the inverted water table iwt to the end of the capillary saturation zone consequently the conventional concept of specific yield infiltration rate and governing equation at the isz frontal surface ifs must be revisited two new isz models are developed and quantified with great details with infiltration rate being constant and variable the equations of hydraulic head profile development and the ifs are obtained this study indicates that classical free surface equations locating at iwt is not self consistent the water balance requirement is not satisfied at ifs in the green and ampt 1911 model or the polubarinova kochina 1962 model causing physically unrealistic spatial variables the increase of the ifs with time exhibits three different modes depending on the infiltration rate and the saturated hydraulic conductivity the maximum depth of an ifs corresponding to a depth with infiltration rate being stable is linearly correlated with stream stage and air entry head the streambed infiltration flux decreases with time and appears to exhibit three modes similar to the ifs evolution the findings of this study reconstruct the theoretical basis of the dynamic evolution process of stream aquifer system and can help for better

decades have shown that water solute and energy exchanges between streams and groundwater involve complex physical chemical and biological processes and feedbacks boano et al 2014 constantz 2016 brunner et al 2017 xian et al 2019 these exchanges are intertwined with many important environmental and engineering issues including water quality national research council 2002 hancock and boulton 2005 lawrence et al 2013 heat transport cardenas and wilson 2007 lewandowski et al 2011 bhaskar et al 2012 rau et al 2012 water resource management theis 1941 osman and bruen 2002 boano et al 2014 stream restoration boulton 2007 kasahara et al 2009 magliozzi et al 2018 and functional attributes of stream ecosystems edwards 1998 sophocleous 2002 boulton et al 2010 water is an important vehicle of solute transport and energy exchange in the stream aquifer system the relative elevation of groundwater level and stream stage determines the basic mode of system evolution and the degree of stream penetrating the underlying aquifer and the streambed clogged conditions also have important influence on the evolution of the system as shown in fig 1 when the local groundwater level is higher than the stream stage the aquifer discharges water to the stream as base flow a gaining stream otherwise it is called a losing stream wilson 1993 osman and bruen 2002 brunner et al 2009a 2009b in the gaining stream aquifer system the stream and groundwater are always completely connected in the losing stream aquifer system the connection between stream and groundwater is much more complicated for losing fully penetrating stream aquifer system osman and bruen 2002 jin et al 2017 water exchanges between the stream and aquifer are mostly through the fully saturated aquifer media and the stream and groundwater are completely connected too theis 1941 glover and balmer 1954 hantush 1965 wallace et al 1990 osman and bruen 2002 for losing partially penetrating stream aquifer system with groundwater level declining the system may evolve from a connected state to a transitional state and eventually to a disconnected state sophocleous 2002 osman and bruen 2002 brunner et al 2009a the clogging streambed peterson and wilson 1988 goldschneider et al 2007 treese et al 2009 can significantly affect the transition of a stream aquifer system from a connected state to a disconnected state or vice versa by imposing additional resistance to flow based on the assumption of one dimensional 1d steady state flow and the law of mass conservation fox and durnford 2003 solved the seepage rate of a stream and the capillary pressure head at the bottom of the clogging layer they pointed out that when the capillary pressure head gradient at the bottom of the clogging layer was equal to zero stream was under a critical state from transitional disconnection to complete disconnection brunner et al 2009a brunner et al 2009b constructed a stream aquifer connectivity theory and suggested that the stream aquifer system became completely disconnected when the top of the capillary zone was below the clogging layer some scholars argued that the existence of a clogging layer was a necessary condition for the disconnection of a stream aquifer system under steady state condition brunner et al 2009b xie et al 2014 however a series of studies show that three possible states of connection transitional and complete disconnection are also possible for an unclogged stream aquifer system reisenauer 1963 sophocleous 2002 wang et al 2011 2016 xie et al 2014 jin et al 2017 when an unclogged stream becomes completely disconnected the stream and groundwater in the underlying aquifer will have a hydraulic head difference and there will be an inverted saturated zone isz beneath the streambed reisenauer 1963 employed a variably saturated finite difference model simulating the distribution of water content and pressure head in a homogeneous soil beneath an unlined irrigation canal under steady state condition and clearly demonstrated the existence of an isz below the stream xie et al 2014 used numerical simulations to show that it was possible to have an isz in an unclogged stream under the steady state condition based on their theoretical analysis wang et al 2011 established a stream aquifer ditch sandbox model and utilized numerical simulations to confirm the existence of an isz beneath unclogged streams the dynamic isz and its front surface may exist in the stream groundwater system without clogging wang et al 2016 showed that the connected stream groundwater system with a constant stream stage can evolve to a disconnected state under the stimulation of river bank pumping which leads to a dynamic or time dependent isz and its front surface the dynamic isz and its front surface can exist in other conditions as well for example for a seasonal losing stream without clogging there is no water in the stream in the dry season thus an unsaturated zone is often formed beneath the streambed on the other hand there is water in the stream in the wet season thus a dynamic isz is formed beneath the streambed as suggested by xie et al 2014 a steady state isz may exist under constant stream stage conditions where the steady state isz is the final state of evolution of a dynamic isz after the lapse of a sufficiently long period of time however this is not to say that a stream aquifer system with a dynamic isz will necessarily develop into a steady state isz in summary isz is an indispensable component of an unclogged stream aquifer system but its evolutionary process is poorly understood up to present first of all the stream aquifer system without a clogging layer is different from the system with a clogging layer in the stream aquifer system with a clogging layer there is a blocking effect on the seepage in the sediment so the system evolution state from the connected state to the disconnected state is easier to quantify theoretically the evolution process of isz in the stream aquifer system without a clogging layer is dynamic so it is difficult to capture the whole evolution process of isz by using the steady state analysis method that is usually employed for investigating the stream aquifer system with a clogging layer secondly the limitations of classical saturated seepage theory see section 3 1 section 6 1 and section 6 2 make it difficult to accurately describe the dynamic evolution process of isz a better description of the evolutional characteristics of isz is of great significance for understanding the hydrodynamics solute transport and energy exchange in a stream aquifer system one of the keys to describe the evolution of isz is to capture the movement of isz frontal surface the purpose of this study is to develop an innovative isz model for an unclogged stream aquifer system with great attention paid to the isz frontal surface movement firstly the evolution mechanism of isz is described and the limitations of the free surface location at rwt iwt and the reasons for the failure of rwt iwt equation are illustrated secondly the free surface is located at the air entry surface and the reason for the mismatch of the water balance relationship at the free surface in the classical isz model green and ampt 1911 model and polubarinova kochina 1962 model is analyzed thirdly the free surface equation locating at ifs is reconstructed and the specific yield and infiltration rate are redefined based on this two analytical models describing the evolution of isz and their parameter estimation models are constructed and the solutions of two analytical models are compared with numerical simulations using hydrogeosphere hgs therrien et al 2010 finally the characteristics of isz evolution are analyzed by using sensitivity analysis method the general sketch of the paper is shown as fig 2 2 problem description to simplify the problem we will focus on investigating the one dimensional 1d cross sectional profile of a stream aquifer system before engaging in the more complex three dimensional 3d stream aquifer interaction the 2d simplification is acceptable when the stream is rather straight and streambed properties do not change dramatically along the stream channel with the scale of concern brunner 2009a b wang et al 2011 2016 xie et al 2014 due to the interplay of capillary force and gravity water discharged from isz will continue to expand around it horizontally and vertically until it reaches a steady state or disappears e g isz being connected to the regional saturation zone in this study however we assume that the horizontal expansion of the wetting front is secondary and negligible thus the problem essentially becomes one dimensional 1d only concerning vertical flow such a 1d approach is based on a number of considerations firstly the 1d approach will be applicable if the horizontal scale of isz is considerably larger than the vertical scale of concern for instance when the stream width is rather large in respect to the vertical scale of concern these conditions are not uncommon in seasonal losing streams for example in the wet season a dynamic isz is formed beneath the streambed and the thickness of the isz increases from zero to a finite value which could be much smaller than the stream width for deep aquifers the thickness of the isz may be much smaller than the width of the stream when the time of investigation is relatively short for shallow aquifers if the difference in elevation between the streambed and the regional water table is much smaller than the stream width the dynamic isz thickness which does not exceed the elevation difference is much smaller than the stream width as well we put this consideration to the test the test subject is a stream aquifer system with homogeneous and isotropic sediment in the four cases the stream stages are 0 4 m 0 8 m 2 m and 3 m the stream widths are 2 m 6 m 10 m and 20 m and corresponding the initial buried depth being half of the stream width respectively the result shows that it is acceptable to ignore the effect of horizontal capillary flux with details shown in section s1 in supporting materials another example for using the 1d approach is to investigate the evolutional process of surface water groundwater in an experimental setting using column tests secondly we are aware that the 1d simplification adopted here may be a concern for application of the theory in some real world setting particularly when discussing a narrow stream which require a 2d or 3d treatment thirdly field heterogeneity is not considered at the present investigation for the sake of simplicity and should be taken into consideration in further study in the future for instance the presence of multiple soil layers with different hydraulic parameters or the presence of clay silt lenses and macropores could impose profound impact on the evolutional process of stream aquifer interaction such heterogeneities cannot be handled by the 1d approach of this investigation and requires a 2d and or 3d approach a task that deserves great attention in future investigations finally the use of 1d approach makes it possible to compare this investigation with previous analytical investigations which are almost always in 1d setting in general one should regard this investigation as a first step of developing a novel theory involving an isz in an unclogged losing stream and further investigations are needed to make it applicable in a heterogeneous 3d real world setting we will investigate a seasonal losing stream which includes a dry season during which the stream channel holds no water and a wet season during which the stream channel holds water in the dry season an unsaturated zone is formed between the streambed and the regional water table in the wet season the stream can be described as a prescribed head dirichlet boundary condition and a dynamic isz is formed beneath the stream for a stream stage being relatively stable during the time span of interest a constant head infiltration model may be applicable as shown in fig 3 the conventional definition of isz is the zone from the bottom of stream to the inverted water table iwt at which the pressure head is 0 the iwt equation has the same form as the regional water table rwt equation when we attempt to use the equation established for rwt in conventional unconfined aquifer flow theory bear 1972 to describe the isz frontal surface motion a number of problems are found in section 6 1 we have reduced the iwt equation having the same form as rwt equation to three forms the iwt equation based on abrupt interface assumption the iwt equation based on modified specific yield and the general form of iwt equation the assumption of abrupt interface is that the free surface is an abrupt interface between air and water in the void space bear 1972 the iwt equation based on the assumption of abrupt interface will lead to physically unrealistic spatial variables which can be confirmed by the green and ampt 1911 model and the polubarinova kochina 1962 model when the iwt equation is modified to conform to the physical reality considering the existence of capillary saturation zone under iwt one can see that the elevation of iwt is time independent such issues will be discussed in details in section 6 1 1 and section 6 2 the iwt equation based on the modified specific yield bear 1972 freeze and cherry 1979 uses the variation of water content within the water table shifting range and the variation of water content in the unsaturated zone outside water table to represent the drainage or storage water capacity of sediment within the water table shifting range which is inappropriate the iwt equation based on modified specific yield also causes physically unrealistic spatial variables which can be confirmed by the green and ampt 1911 model and the polubarinova kochina 1962 model with appropriate modifications this is also discussed in details in section 6 1 2 and section 6 2 the conclusion deduced from the general form of iwt equation is that iwt shifting is driven only by the infiltration rate and such an iwt equation is also problematic as discussed in details in section 6 1 3 the problem with above three forms of iwt equations directly extended from conventional unconfined aquifer flow theory motivates us to develop a physically sound new set of iwt equation the concept of this new iwt equation is explained as follows there is an inverted capillary saturation zone icz from iwt to a depth at which the pressure head equals the air entry pressure ha as shown in fig 3 the icz is also completely saturated just like isz above iwt but with negative pressure heads this motivates us to revisit the flow dynamics associated with an isz by moving the free surface of isz from iwt to the lower end of icz in other words the revised isz includes two sections section a is the saturated region from the bottom of stream to iwt in which pressure heads are positive while section b is icz in which pressure heads are negative regardless of their differences in pressure heads section a and section b are both completely saturated thus one can use darcy s law with a saturated hydraulic conductivity to compute the water flux from now on the isz always refers to the combination of section a and section b discussed above the region below isz is partially saturated and requires an unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and the darcy buckingham law or the darcy s law for unsaturated flow to calculate flux this modification is of course based on a presumption that the hydraulic conductivity is only dependent on the degree of saturation if this presumption cannot hold then one cannot use the approach proposed here for most sediments encountered below the unclogged streams this presumption is valid the newly defined isz will become the same as previously used isz if the air entry pressure is zero or section b completely disappears in fact air entry pressure is usually finite for most soil types brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 the lower boundary of isz is called the isz frontal surface ifs where pressure head equals to air entry value hereinafter as shown in fig 3 because ifs is the interface between saturated and unsaturated water contents the movement of ifs is closely related to the unsaturated zone as described in section 3 2 because of the shift of lower free boundary of saturated flow from iwt to ifs the equation for describing such a free boundary needs to be developed first 3 theoretical basis 3 1 inverted saturated zone model we will first derive the ifs equation in a general 3d framework and then simplify the equation for the 1d case in this section there are two reasons to derive the ifs equation in a general 3d framework despite the fact that this study is focused on the 1d case firstly the established 3d framework makes it straightforward to expand the 1d investigation of this study to 2d and or 3d investigations that will be carried out on the basis of this study secondly the 1d equation that will be discussed in details below actually cannot be directly extended to 2d or 3d frameworks the lower limit of the isz model is set up on ifs which is the interface between saturated and unsaturated water content and the ifs shift will alter the sediment water content in the shifting range in the following we will establish a differential equation describing the ifs movement in a general 3d setting for the uniformity of developing a general 3d theory in the near future following this 1d study at ifs the hydraulic head h is 1 h x y z t z h a where x and y are horizontal coordinates in two orthogonal directions respectively cm the z axis is positive upward and the origin of the coordinate system is at the boundary of the streambed and the underneath sediment cm ha is the air entry head which is a negative value cm t is time s for a moving ifs one has the implicit equation f of the ifs as follows 2 f x y z t h x y z t z h a 0 because the water content at ifs is saturated it has no more storage space or no extra space to store water and water flowing into the surface per unit area is equal to the water flowing out per unit area a point to note is that the storativity due to elasticity of media and water is too small to be included here unless one is dealing with mostly clayey porous media from a practical standpoint this study concerns more permeable porous media types so that sizable downward seepage below the streambed is possible to occur and it does not concern too much about a clayey porous media because such media will effectively block any downward seepage due to its extremely small permeability value in another word the drainage effect plays a dominating role while the storage effect is secondary and negligible hereinafter nevertheless based on the water flow balance principle stated above one has 3 μ ha v n w n v n where μ ha is the specific yield at ifs cm3 cm3 w is the infiltration rate vector w w k cm s w is the infiltration rate cm s a negative w signifies the downward water movement from isz to sediment below ifs while a positive w signifies the upward water movement from sediment below ifs to isz v n is the moving velocity of ifs cm s v n is water flowing out from isz to ifs per unit area or specific discharge cm s the significance of eq 3 is that a certain portion of water flowing out of ifs increases the water volume within the ifs shifting range and rest portion flows out as discharge combining eq 2 and eq 3 a differential equation for the ifs can be established with details shown in section s2 in supporting materials 4 μ ha h t k x h x 2 k y h y 2 k z h z 2 k z w h z w where kx ky and kz are the saturated hydraulic conductivities in the x y and z directions respectively cm s for the 1d case eq 4 can be written as 5 μ ha h t k z h z 2 k z w h z w eq 5 can be linearized by omitting the quadratic term on the right hand side of eq 5 such a linearization has been broadly used before in dealing with free interfaces in porous media flow and one may see detailed discussions about this matter in bear 1972 1979 after the linearization one has 6 μ ha h t k z w h z w two points should be noted about eqs 5 and 6 being used in 1d constant head infiltration condition firstly the specific yield μha represents the drainage or storage capacity of the soil column in the ifs shifting range the specific yield is redefined at ifs as the volumetric water change in the sediment column in ifs shifting range over a unit area when ifs falls by a unit height due to gravity shown as fig 4 according to the definition of μha the water volume change δvμ within the ifs shifting range is used to calculate the specific yield 7 μ ha δ v μ a δ z ha where a is the unit horizontal free surface area cm2 δ z ha is the change in the ifs elevation cm the second point is about the infiltration rate w at ifs which is defined as the amount of water flowing out of isz through ifs per unit area per unit time due to gravity and capillary force shown as fig 4 depending on the buried depth of rwt the extended wetting zone may be influenced by the regional saturation zone or not the water flowing out of isz may be stored in the extended wetting zone or in both the extended wetting zone and the regional saturation zone which will influence the quantification of the w term if the water flowing out of isz is only stored in the extended wetting zone shown as fig 4 the water volume change δv w within the extended wetting zone can be used to calculate the w term shown as eq 8 a if the water flowing out of isz is stored in both the extended wetting zone and the regional saturation zone the quantification of the water volume flowing out of isz and the w term which is time dependent becomes more challenging nevertheless one may still use the following eq 8 b which is simply a reorganization of above eq 6 to compute w provided that the terms on the right hand side of eq 8 b can be determined accurately 8 a w δ v w a δ t 8 b w μ ha h t k z h z 1 h z where δ t is the change in time s 3 2 solving the inverted saturated zone model 3 2 1 the inverted saturated zone model under 1d condition a 1d analysis can capture the main characteristics of isz evolution shown as fig 5 supposing that there is a seasonal losing stream at the end of the dry season or the start of the wet season the system is under hydrostatic condition the stream stage rises rapidly from 0 to a constant value of d 0 in the wet season generating a dynamic isz beneath the streambed the isz model can be then written as 9 a z k z h z 0 z h a z 0 0 t 9 b h z t t 0 z z h a 0 z h a 0 d 0 z h a 0 h a z h a 0 h a 9 c h z t z 0 d 0 9 d h z t z z h a z ha h a 9 e μ ha h t k z w h z w where eq 9 a is the continuity equation of flow bear 1972 which means the hydraulic head being a linear equation of z in isz eq 9 b is the hydraulic head profile in isz at initial time being derived based on eqs 9 a 9 c and 9 d t is the local time after the instantaneous rise of the stream stage from 0 to d 0 s zha is the ifs depth zha 0 cm zha 0 is the ifs depth at the starting time zha 0 0 cm according to eqs 7 and 8 a it can be found that the specific yield μha and infiltration rate w depend on the pressure head profile or water content profile of unsaturated zone under ifs as these two profiles change with the development of seepage process the specific yield μha and infiltration rate w are time dependent at the same time the pressure head profile or water content profile of unsaturated zone is affected by the initial conditions of seepage boundary conditions lithology seepage duration and other factors which also affect the specific yield μha and infiltration rate w therefore it is unrealistic to obtain the relationship between the specific yield μha or infiltration rate w and time in the framework that only concerns saturated flow indeed this is the limitation of saturated flow theory associated with isz or unconfined aquifer analysis if one insists on solving the problem within the framework of the conventional saturated flow theory in an approximate sense the following three strategies may be helpful firstly the empirical formulae of the specific yield μha and time and the infiltration rate w and time under different hydrogeological conditions may be obtained by extensive tests for solving the ifs equation eq 9 e this treatment is similar to the soil water characteristic curve empirical model brooks corey model brooks and corey 1964 or van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 secondly in order to simplify the solution of ifs equation the specific yield μha and the infiltration rate w are assumed to be constants to represent the temporally averaged values of the specific yield μha and the infiltration rate w over the temporal scale of concern and such temporally averaged μha and w may be obtained using an inverse process of parameter estimation thirdly the analytic solution of ifs motion can be obtained by using the simplified richards equation charbeneau 2000 without solving the ifs equation eq 9 e however the simplified richards equation charbeneau 2000 only considers the gravity term and ignores the diffusive term which will lead to errors in describing the ifs motion which means that the parameters of the simplified richards equation must be adjusted if one expects to minimize the error therefore it is recommended to use a parameter estimation process to determine the adjusted parameters associated with the simplified richards equation so as to obtain a relatively accurate ifs motion process in such a parameter estimation process the specific yield μha is assumed as a constant first but the infiltration rate w can be time dependent in the following analysis we will use the second and third strategies to solve the ifs movement and the hydraulic head profiles in isz within the saturated flow framework which are named the analytical solution for a constant w and a time dependent w respectively 3 2 2 the analytical solution for a constant w based on eqs 9 a 9 c and 9 d the hydraulic head of isz is 10 h d 0 h a z ha z ha z d 0 by substituting eqs 9 d and 10 into eq 9 e and considering the fact that at the initial time zha zha 0 one has the simplified ifs differential equation shown as eq s11 in section s3 in supporting materials when the constant specific yield μha and the constant infiltration rate w are used the ifs depth can be derived from eq s11 in section s3 in supporting materials as 11 z ha k z w d 0 h a ln k z w d 0 h a k z z ha k z w d 0 h a k z z h a 0 k z k z μ ha t z h a 0 substituting eq 11 into eq 10 one can obtain the analytical solution for the hydraulic head profile of isz 3 2 3 the analytical solution for a time dependent w to obtain an analytical solution with a time dependent w term the following simplifications are introduced when the water content is close to saturation gravity is the dominating driving force of flow as compared to capillary force therefore the diffusion term of eq 12 a can be neglected and the partial differential equation for unsaturated flow can be written as eq 12 b charbeneau 2000 12 a θ t z d θ θ z k θ z 12 b θ t k θ z where d θ is capillary diffusivity cm2 s k θ is the hydraulic conductivity of the unsaturated zone cm s as an example of illustration the soil water characteristic curve is assumed to follow the brooks corey model brooks and corey 1964 13 s e θ θ r θ s θ r h a h λ h h a 1 h h a where θ s is the saturation water content cm3 cm3 θ r is the residual water content cm3 cm3 h a is the air entry head cm λ is a brooks corey model parameter called the pore size distribution index dimensionless the hydraulic conductivity function follows the burdine model burdine 1953 brooks and corey 1964 1966 14 k s e k z s e 2 3 λ λ where se is the effective saturation cm3 cm3 k se is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm s we need to emphasize that the use of eqs 12 and 13 is only for the purpose of illustration other types of equations if proven to be better for describing the soil water characteristic curve and the soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity can be employed as well by substituting eqs 13 and 14 into eq 12 b the ifs with θ θ s shift can be derived as 15 z h a z h a 0 2 3 λ k z λ θ s θ r t the derivation and discussion of eq 15 are given in section s4 in supporting materials substituting eq 15 into eq 10 the hydraulic head profile of isz can be derived as 16 h 1 λ θ s θ r d 0 h a z h a 0 λ θ s θ r 2 3 λ k z t z d 0 substituting eq 15 into eq s11 a in section s3 in supporting materials the infiltration rate w is 17 w z ha μ ha 2 3 λ k z λ θ s θ r k z d 0 h a z ha d 0 h a 4 materials and methods in order to test the analytical model developed above a numerical saturated unsaturated flow model using hydrogeosphere hgs was developed to calculate the hydraulic head profile and compared with the above analytical model since the specific yield μha is assumed to be constant in the two analytical models and the infiltration rate can be time independent or time dependent as mentioned in the aforementioned second and third strategies in section 3 2 1 we need to establish two different parameter estimation models to estimate the parameters involved in such two analytical models such estimated parameters include the specific yield initial ifs depth infiltration rate saturated water content residual water content air entry head and pore size distribution index we introduce the parameter estimation models in details in section s5 1 in supporting materials in the hgs model the soil layer thickness was set to be 200 cm the reference surface was the streambed and the initial hydraulic head was computed using the hydrostatic condition the upper boundary was the constant head boundary with a hydraulic head of 40 cm the lower boundary was the regional water table which is 200 cm below the streambed two floridian soils fine sand and fine sandy loam were used carlisle et al 1989 tested the soil characteristics water retention data and the physical soil parameters of these two soil types are shown in table 1 nachabe 2002 for the mulat fine sandy loam and mulat fine sand the observation points were at depths of 4 cm and 10 cm below the streambed for the parameter estimation model with a time independent w the starting and ending times of observation were respectively t 0 24 hr and t 10 74 hr for the mulat fine sandy loam and t 0 24 hr was set as the initial time for the parameter estimation model this was the local time tlocal 0 for the initial ifs depth zha 0 the starting and ending times for the mulat fine sand were respectively t 0 12 hr and t 5 7 hr and the t 0 12 hr was set as the initial time time steps were 0 06 hr data points at 176 time steps for the mulat fine sandy loam and 94 time steps for the mulat fine sand were collected for the parameter estimation model with time dependent w eq 15 shows that the ifs depth and time are linearly related however the observed ifs depth through the parameter estimation model and time were obviously nonlinear at the early stage to avoid the nonlinearity at early stage the starting time for parameter estimation model was push back and the new starting and ending times of observation were respectively t 2 04 hr and t 10 74 hr for the mulat fine sandy loam and t 2 04 hr was set as the initial time for the parameter estimation model the new starting and ending times for the mulat fine sand were respectively t 1 08 hr and t 5 7 hr and the t 1 08 hr was set as the initial time time steps were 0 06 hr data points at 146 time steps for the mulat fine sandy loam and 78 time steps for the mulat fine sand were collected extensive numerical exercises were conducted to make sure that the results of numerical simulations were not affected by the chosen spatiotemporal discretization mesh to test the rationality of the analytical models and the robustness of the parameter estimation models the hydraulic heads of the observation points computed using hgs were used as inputs in the parameter estimation model to estimate the parameters with both time independent and time dependent w schemes the parameter values estimated using analytical model will be compared with the original input parameter values in hgs finally results of the hydraulic head profiles computed using the analytical and hgs models will be compared we have documented the comparison in details in section s5 2 in supporting materials 5 results the evolution of isz in the sediment beneath the streambed is controlled by the ifs shifting in this section we only show the ifs shifting process of two floridian soils and compare the ifs shifting processes calculated by analytical models and the hgs models as part of the comparison of the parameter estimation models we put the evolution of hydraulic head in isz in section s5 2 in supporting materials fig 6 shows the development of the ifs depth zha in fig 6 the gold line is the values of zha computed using the numerical model of hgs the orange line is the values of zha computed using the analytical model with a constant w and the gray line is the values of zha computed using the analytical model with a variable w in the early stage the zha value increases nonlinearly with time after the early stage the zha value starts to increase with time in an approximately linear fashion fig 6 shows that for the case of constant w the zha values computed using the analytical model match closely with the zha values computed using numerical model of hgs with only small discrepancies at the end of the simulation period overall the match of the analytical and numerical models with a constant w is better than that with a variable w and the match of the analytical and numerical models with variable w is better for the mulat fine sandy loam fig 6 a than for the mulat fine sand fig 6 b 6 discussion 6 1 discussion of iwt equation the iwt equation and the regional water table rwt equation have the same mathematical form and physical function the difference of iwt from rwt in an unconfined aquifer is that the relative positions of saturated versus unsaturated zones are opposite thus gravity drainage will attempt to pull the iwt towards the underneath unsaturated zone while gravity drainage will attempt to pull the rwt away from the upper unsaturated zone in this section three previously mentioned iwt equations with different physical meanings are discussed which are respectively called iwt equation based on abrupt interface assumption type 1 iwt equation based on modified specific yield type 2 and the general formula of iwt equation type 3 for convenience of discussion the constant head infiltration model described in section 3 2 is applied the difference is that the free surface boundary is set at iwt as shown in fig 7 the general formula of iwt equation is written as 18 μ h t k z w h z w 6 1 1 the type 1 iwt equation based on abrupt interface assumption according to the assumption of neglecting the presence of moisture above or outside the free surface e g in the capillary fringe and assume that the free surface is an abrupt interface between air and water in the void space bear 1972 the influence of the change of water volume in the unsaturated zone on the water balance at iwt is not considered in type 1 iwt equation this is similar with the assumption utilized in the green and ampt 1911 model and the polubarinova kochina 1962 model in which the free surface wetting front is a sharp boundary dividing initial soil moisture below from saturated soil in this case because the water flowing out of isz through iwt is ignored the infiltration rate w is 0 thus eq 18 can be written as 19 μ h t k z h z when the negative pressure head of the free surface boundary in these two models is 0 the free surface boundary is iwt however the abrupt interface assumption is not physically realistic due to the interplay of capillary force and gravity there exists a capillary saturation zone below iwt and this zone shifts along with the moving iwt in other words at any two adjacent moments with a sufficiently short period of time the iwt moving range is always completely saturated therefore the term associated with the specific yield i e the storage change is 0 and eq 19 should be written as 20 a 0 k z h z 20 b h c where c is constant eq 20 indicates that the elevation of iwt is time independent thus eq 19 cannot accurately depict the motion of a free surface boundary 6 1 2 the type 2 iwt equation based on the modified specific yield the type 2 iwt equation involves a modification of the specific yield to a modified specific yield denoted as μ to correct eq 19 where μ is defined as the volume of water released by gravity from the soil column per unit area extending to the ground surface from the water table when the water table declines by one unit of depth bear 1972 the μ term defined in such a manner is time dependent if μ is applied to the iwt equation the upper boundary is located at iwt and the lower boundary is located at the lower boundary of the wetting zone below iwt that is the computational domain includes the iwt shifting range and the extended wetting zone in the unsaturated zone shown as fig 8 a due to the fact that μ includes the change of water volume in the iwt shifting region and the extended zone the infiltration rate w should be zero thus eq 18 can be written as 21 μ h t k z h z however eq 21 is problematic as well the main reason is that the change of water volume in the wetting zone below iwt is regarded as part of the specific yield so as to ensure the water balance at iwt actually the wetting zone is located outside the iwt shifting range and the change of water volume in the wetting zone is caused by the change of capillary force and gravity in the zone below the iwt shifting range thus the water stored in iwt and water infiltration in the zone below the iwt shifting range are not physically compatible the specific yield defined in this way thus becomes physically questionable we can use the green and ampt 1911 model and the polubarinova kochina 1962 model as examples to illustrate this matter further before doing so we need to slightly modify the green and ampt 1911 model and the polubarinova kochina 1962 model to conform to the modified specific yield concept here when μ is used to describe the modified green and ampt 1911 model and the polubarinova kochina 1962 model the free surface equation can be written as eq 21 with pressure head of free surface being equal to zero in both models the modified green and ampt 1911 model and the polubarinova kochina 1962 model lead to physically questionable results of the depth of free surface shown as section 6 2 6 1 3 the type 3 general form of iwt equation when the change of water volume in the wetting zone under the iwt shifting range is considered as the non zero infiltration rate w the iwt equation shown in fig 7 should be written as eq 18 the computational domain only involves the iwt shifting range as shown in fig 8 b due to the existence of a capillary saturation zone below iwt at any two adjacent moments with a sufficiently short period of time the water content maintains saturated in the iwt shifting range and the term associated with the specific yield i e the storage change equals to zero thus eq 18 should be written as 22 0 k z w h z w eq 22 indicates that iwt shifting is driven only by the infiltration rate w comparison of eq 18 and 22 indicates that the general formula of iwt equation eq 18 is inconsistent with eq 22 in which the term on the left side of eq 18 becomes redundant 6 2 discussion of the green and ampt 1911 model and polubarinova kochina 1962 model green and ampt 1911 developed a 1d constant head infiltration model to study the evolution process of the isz in a homogeneous isotropy sediment under the condition of ponded water on the soil surface polubarinova kochina 1962 used this model to study the evolution process of isz under the condition of reservoir seepage both models assume the same condition for water balance at free surface boundary wetting front i e the free surface is a sharp boundary dividing initial soil moisture below from the saturated soil above the free surface equations in both models are the same in this section the free surface equation from the polubarinova kochina 1962 model is discussed shown as fig 9 the base level of the model is at the bottom of the reservoir the vertical coordinate is positive downwards represented by z a point to note is that the z axis direction of polubarinova kochina 1962 is opposite of the z axis direction of this study see fig 5 but this does not affect the conclusions the water level of the reservoir is h and other physical quantities are shown as fig 9 the differential equation of the free surface given by polubarinova kochina 1962 is shown in eq 23 a and the transcendental equation of the free surface is shown in eq 23 b polubarinova kochina 1962 attempted to use this model to describe two situations where the free surface boundary is at iwt shown as fig 9 and at the base of isz shown as eq 23 when the capillary height in eq 23 is ignored i e hk 0 the isz front of the polubarinova kochina 1962 model is located at iwt for the convenience of comparison the symbols used in this section are the same as those used in polubarinova kochina 1962 s original text if the symbol used by polubarinova kochina 1962 is the same as those used in this article we add a sign of to the symbol used by polubarinova kochina 1962 to single it out 23 a m d z 0 dt k h h k z 0 z 0 23 b z 0 h h k ln 1 z 0 h h k kt m h h k where z 0 is the depth of free surface cm k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity in the z direction cm s m is the porosity cm3 cm3 hk is the capillary height cm comparing eq 23 a with eq 18 it can be found that the porosity m or more precisely the drainable porosity is used to replace the specific yield which is constant and the infiltration rate is set to 0 in the polubarinova kochina 1962 model in order to further analyze the polubarinova kochina 1962 solution the ranges of parameter values in eq 23 is discussed in fig 9 the vertical coordinate is positive downward thus 24 z 0 0 according to eq 23 a the depth of ifs under steady state can be obtained as 25 z 0 st h h k 0 where z 0 st is the depth of the free surface under steady state condition cm the value of h and h k see the section s6 in supporting materials eq 25 is in contrast to eq 24 meaning that the polubarinova kochina 1962 solution is problematic and appears to be physically impossible when the modified specific yield μ is used to describe the modified green and ampt 1911 model and the polubarinova kochina 1962 model it is necessary to replace m with μ in eq 23 a for μ d z 0 dt k h h k z 0 z 0 the same conclusion can still be derived under steady state condition on the other hand even if we disregard the physically unrealistic problem of the polubarinova kochina 1962 solution this model still cannot accurately describe the ifs migration the depth of the ifs under steady state condition is the maximum depth that isz can reach which equals to the water level of reservoir plus the capillary height in the polubarinova kochina 1962 solution in other words the depth of the ifs should not be larger than z 0 st for the mulat fine sandy loam z 0 st is 79 1 cm for the mulat fine sand z 0 st is 69 2 cm however the depths of the isz fronts simulated by hgs exceeded z 0 st for the mulat fine sandy loam and the mulat fine sand as shown in fig 6 to sum up if the free surface boundary of the green and ampt 1911 model or the polubarinova kochina 1962 model is set at iwt hk 0 the above discussion proves that the iwt equation based on the assumed abrupt interface in section 6 1 1 and the iwt equation in section 6 1 2 are not self consistent or contradictory with each other if the free surface boundary of the green and ampt 1911 model or the polubarinova kochina 1962 model is set at ifs hk ha the above discussion confirms that the influence of the change of water volume in the zone below the shifting range of ifs on the water balance of ifs should not be ignored otherwise the water balance requirement is not satisfied at ifs 6 3 ifs motion with constant w 6 3 1 the range of w the infiltration rate discussed in this study indicates the capacity of water flow from isz through the ifs to the underneath sediments analyzing the range of w is helpful to capture the characteristics of a dynamic ifs eq 11 describes the development of the ifs position versus time with a constant specific yield and a constant infiltration rate which are in an approximate sense being respectively the temporally averaged values of the specific yield μha and the infiltration rate w over the temporal scale of concern to use this equation properly several constraints must be noticed firstly the term inside the logarithmic function in eq 11 has to be positive otherwise eq 11 will give an imaginary or undefined value which is clearly incorrect secondly the depth of the ifs should not be less than the initial depth of ifs and the rate of change of the depth of ifs should increase with isz development with the stream seepage without other sources or sinks in the system see fig 5 thirdly the saturated hydraulic conductivity kz the ifs depth zha the initial ifs depth zha 0 the stream stage d 0 and the specific yield μ ha are no less than zero and the air entry head ha is less than zero based on these constraints one can determine the range of w as 26 k z z h a 0 d 0 h a k z w 0 the detailed derivation of eq 26 is shown in the section s7 in supporting materials 6 3 2 the ifs depth with a constant w the depth of the ifs under steady state condition z ha st is the maximum depth that isz can reach in a losing stream groundwater system with the streambed seepage being the only source of water the analysis of the characteristics of the ifs depth in steady state condition can serve as a baseline to further revealing the evolution of a steam groundwater system under the steady state infiltration rate according to eq 9 e eq s11 a in section s3 in supporting materials and z ha t 0 the depth of ifs z ha st can be written as 27 z ha st k z w d 0 h a k z according to eq 27 one can find that the stream stage air entry head and saturated hydraulic conductivity will affect the maximum depth of ifs with a constant w analyzing the first derivative of the controlling factor of a physical term of concern can reflect the rate of change of such a term to the change of that controlling factor while the positive and negative signs of such a first derivative can reflect the direction of the correlation between the physical term and its controlling factor ye and shen 2006 liu et al 2016 cheng et al 2020 when the first derivative of the stream stage d 0 is used in eq 27 then according to eq 26 and the third constrain in section 6 3 1 the influence of the stream stage d 0 on the depth z ha st can be analyzed as follows 28 i f k z z h a 0 d 0 h a k z w k z z ha st d 0 k z w k z 0 i f w k z z ha st d 0 k z w k z 0 i f k z w 0 z ha st d 0 k z w k z 0 where z ha st is the maximum isz depth at a given stream stage eq 28 indicates that the maximum ifs depth may increase or decrease monotonously with increasing stream stage when the first derivative of the air entry head value ha is used in eq 27 then according to eq 26 and the third constrain in section 6 3 1 the influence of the air entry head value ha on the depth z ha st can be analyzed as follows 29 i f k z z h a 0 d 0 h a k z w k z z ha st h a k z w k z 0 i f w k z z ha st h a k z w k z 0 i f k z w 0 z ha st h a k z w k z 0 eq 29 indicates that the maximum ifs depth may increase or decrease monotonously with the absolute values of the increasing air entry head when the first derivative of saturated hydraulic conductivity kz is used in eq 27 then according to eq 26 and the third constrain in section 6 3 1 the influence of the saturation hydraulic conductivity kz on the depth z ha st can be analyzed as 30 z ha st k z w k z 2 d 0 h a 0 eq 30 indicates that an increase in the saturated hydraulic conductivity will lead to decrease of the maximum isz depth in summary the maximum depth of ifs is negatively correlated with the saturated hydraulic conductivity and may be positively or negatively correlated with stream stage and air entry head value depending on the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the infiltration rate the results of the analysis suggest that the influence of these factors should be considered cohesively instead of relying on a single factor in regulating the development of isz 6 3 3 development of the ifs depth the ifs depth zha should increase with the isz development in the system as clearly seen in the first derivative or slope of zha versus time in fig 6 we can further analyze the characteristics of zha using the second derivative of zha versus time indeed first derivative and second derivative analysis have been proven to be very effective in analyzing transient well testing pressure data in petroleum engineering and hydrological sciences ehlig economides 1988 dejam et al 2018 analyzing the second derivative of the controlling factor of a physical term of concern can reflect the tendency of the rate of change of the term of concern the second derivative together with the first derivative are powerful diagnostic tools for investigating a dynamical system involving multiple controlling parameters ye and shen 2006 liu et al 2016 cheng et al 2020 according to eq 9 e and eq s11 a in section s3 in supporting materials the second derivative of time t of the ifs depth is 31 2 z ha t 2 1 μ ha 2 k z w 2 d 0 h a 2 z ha 3 k z k z w d 0 h a z ha 2 according to eq 31 and the third constrain in section 6 3 1 eq 31 can be analyzed as follows when k z w 0 there is 32 2 z ha t 2 1 μ ha 2 k z w 2 d 0 h a 2 z ha 3 1 k z z ha k z w d 0 h a 0 for this mode zha increases with time t but the rate of change gradually slows down with time as shown by curve i in fig 10 when w k z 33 2 z ha t 2 0 and 34 z ha t k z μ ha for this mode zha increases with time t at a constant rate of k z μ ha as shown in curve ii of fig 10 when k z z h a 0 d 0 h a k z w k z 35 2 z ha t 2 1 μ ha 2 k z w 2 d 0 h a 2 z ha 3 1 k z z ha k z w d 0 h a 0 for this mode zha increases with time t and the rate of change gradually increases as well as shown by curve iii in fig 10 in summary fig 10 indicates that the ifs depth can have three distinctively different evolutional modes depending on different ranges of the constant w values 6 3 4 the development of streambed seepage flux the streambed seepage of a losing stream is a key factor in water resources management thus delineation of the streambed flux characteristics of a losing stream is of great significance to guide the development and utilization of water resources and the sustainable management of interconnected ecosystems fox and durnford 2003 brunner et al 2009a 2009b fleckenstein et al 2010 the streambed flux of the unclogged stream is equal to the seepage flux of isz in combination with eq 10 the streambed flux q of an unclogged stream can be expressed as 36 q k z h z k z d 0 h a z ha 1 due to the development of a dynamic ifs zha as shown in section 6 3 3 and the third constrain in section 6 3 1 h z decreases with time and reaches a minimum value when seepage becomes stable consequently the streambed flux q decreases with time as well and will eventually arrive at its stable minimum value furthermore similar to what has been seen in fig 10 the decreasing trend of the streambed flux also has three modes the rate of change of the streambed flux can either gradually decline or remain constant or gradually increase with time 6 4 limitations of the solutions 6 4 1 limitations of solution with variable w the partial differential equation ignoring the diffusion term charbeneau 2000 for unsaturated flow can be used to derive the depth evolution equation for ifs zha as shown in eq 15 the first derivative of zha versus time is 37 z h a t 2 3 λ k z λ θ s θ r 2 k z λ θ s θ r 3 k z θ s θ r because the pore distribution index λ the saturated hydraulic conductivity kz and the differences between the saturated and residual water content θ s θ r are all positive constants eq 37 is a constant positive value this means that zha always increases with time so the infiltration process resembles a downward piston flow with a uniform velocity according to eq 37 the main factors influencing ifs are λ kz and θ s θ r the value of λ reflects the influence of the pore size distribution on the soil water characteristic curve and a larger λ value means a more uniform pore size distribution xie 2015 the value of θ s θ r reflects the largest water storage space per unit volume of soil eq 37 indicates that the ifs depth develops with time in a slower rate in soils with a more uniform pore size distribution and or a larger water storage space a larger kz means a more permeable soil thus a higher specific discharge or infiltration rate under the same hydraulic head gradient eq 37 indicates that the ifs depth develops more rapidly in a soil with a higher saturated hydraulic conductivity 6 4 2 limitations of this study the paper uses idealized geometries and boundary conditions and identifies basic principles and mechanisms rather than solutions for specific field problems the focus of this study is to reconstruct a basic theory of evolution of a stream aquifer system based on a conceptual model with a few controlling factors first and then to build up a more comprehensive and complex theory incorporating more realistic and most likely heterogeneous system later without the basic theory of this study it is very difficult or even impossible to develop the comprehensive theory eventually this basic theory includes contents analyzing the limitations of the classical saturated seepage theory and the classical isz model see section 2 6 1 and 6 2 calibrating the position of the free surface redefining the specific yield and infiltration rate and reconstructing the equation of the free surface see section 3 1 however this study also has a number of limitations that deserve further attention in the future investigations those limitations are briefly summarized as follows 1 this paper focuses on the evolution of isz under 1d infiltration scenario which is applicable to the assumed conditions set in section 3 1 this study can also be used to track the evolution of the frontal point of the 2d axisymmetric isz profile however this study only considers the influence of vertical capillary flux when this study is extended to 2d or 3d infiltration schemes the influence of horizontal capillary flux should be considered stream stage is an important driving force for isz evolution in the stream aquifer system in this study the constant stream stage assumption is adopted the natural stream stage is time dependent and its influence on the evolution of isz needs to be considered in future work 2 this study is based on the saturated seepage theory and the specific yield is treated as a constant therefore the influence of time dependent specific yield on the evolution of isz cannot be reflected in the solution soil homogeneity is assumed in this conceptual model and it should be relaxed to include soil heterogeneity such as layering and preferential flow pathways in the future 3 this study relies mostly on an analytical approach to address the concept and theoretical frameworks for a simplified stream aquifer system the analytical approach is probably not favorable for dealing with complex processes of real world stream aquifer interaction when considering transiency field heterogeneity three dimensionality which may require a carefully designed numerical model one optimal approach is to develop the theoretic framework using analytical modeling first which is the present work and then to apply the theory to realistic problems using complex numerical models which is our next phase of research 7 summary and conclusions in the paper the theoretical basis of isz evolution analysis in an unclogged stream aquifer system is established and the evolution characteristics of isz in a seasonal losing stream aquifer system is analyzed based on a detailed analysis of the limitations of the free surface equation locating at rwt or iwt in the present saturated flow theory and the isz model developed by green and ampt 1911 or polubarinova kochina 1962 this study reconstructs the free surface equation redefines the specific yield and infiltration rate and modifies the isz model of green and ampt 1911 or polubarinova kochina 1962 compared with the numerical solution the robustness of the new model is verified finally sensitivity analysis is used to reveal the evolution characteristics of isz the paper uses idealized geometries and boundary conditions and identifies basic principles and mechanisms rather than solutions for specific field problems the key findings of the paper are the free surface equation in the classical saturated theory is not self consistent locating the free surface of aquifer at rwt or the free surface of isz at iwt lacks a solid theoretical basis the primary limitation of the classical isz model developed by green and ampt 1911 or polubarinova kochina 1962 is that the water balance requirement is not satisfied at ifs which results in physically unrealistic spatial variables the free surface of aquifer or isz should be located at the air entry surface in the new isz model the specific yield is redefined at ifs as the volumetric water change in the sediment column in ifs shifting range over a unit area when ifs falls by a unit height due to gravity infiltration rate w is defined as the amount of water flowing out of isz through ifs per unit area per unit time due to gravity and capillary force to solve the isz model within the framework of the conventional saturated flow theory an approximate treatment of specific yield and infiltration rate is required in this paper solutions of isz model with the specific yield being assumed as a constant and the infiltration rate being assumed as a constant or being time dependent are suggested the parameter estimation models are constructed based on these two solutions the newly obtained solutions are tested against the numerical simulation results using hgs with satisfaction the analytical solution with a constant w is better than the solution with a variable w based on the analytical solution with a constant w the evolution characteristics of isz are captured the isz frontal surface exhibits three modes of motion with different infiltration rate w i e the isz frontal surface burial depth increases with time with a an increasing rate b a constant rate and c a decreasing rate the maximum ifs depth decreases with the increasing saturation hydraulic conductivity and is linearly correlated with the stream stage and sediment air entry head the hydraulic head gradient behind the ifs decreases with time and reaches a minimum value with a constant infiltration rate w the streambed flux decreases with time and also exhibits three different modes a mode with an

4634,unclogged streams are widespread in nature and can generate dynamic inverted saturated zones isz underneath the streams above the regional water tables this study is devoted to investigating the evolutional process of such an isz and its frontal movement it defines a uniform saturation zone by moving the boundary of saturation flow from the inverted water table iwt to the end of the capillary saturation zone consequently the conventional concept of specific yield infiltration rate and governing equation at the isz frontal surface ifs must be revisited two new isz models are developed and quantified with great details with infiltration rate being constant and variable the equations of hydraulic head profile development and the ifs are obtained this study indicates that classical free surface equations locating at iwt is not self consistent the water balance requirement is not satisfied at ifs in the green and ampt 1911 model or the polubarinova kochina 1962 model causing physically unrealistic spatial variables the increase of the ifs with time exhibits three different modes depending on the infiltration rate and the saturated hydraulic conductivity the maximum depth of an ifs corresponding to a depth with infiltration rate being stable is linearly correlated with stream stage and air entry head the streambed infiltration flux decreases with time and appears to exhibit three modes similar to the ifs evolution the findings of this study reconstruct the theoretical basis of the dynamic evolution process of stream aquifer system and can help for better

decades have shown that water solute and energy exchanges between streams and groundwater involve complex physical chemical and biological processes and feedbacks boano et al 2014 constantz 2016 brunner et al 2017 xian et al 2019 these exchanges are intertwined with many important environmental and engineering issues including water quality national research council 2002 hancock and boulton 2005 lawrence et al 2013 heat transport cardenas and wilson 2007 lewandowski et al 2011 bhaskar et al 2012 rau et al 2012 water resource management theis 1941 osman and bruen 2002 boano et al 2014 stream restoration boulton 2007 kasahara et al 2009 magliozzi et al 2018 and functional attributes of stream ecosystems edwards 1998 sophocleous 2002 boulton et al 2010 water is an important vehicle of solute transport and energy exchange in the stream aquifer system the relative elevation of groundwater level and stream stage determines the basic mode of system evolution and the degree of stream penetrating the underlying aquifer and the streambed clogged conditions also have important influence on the evolution of the system as shown in fig 1 when the local groundwater level is higher than the stream stage the aquifer discharges water to the stream as base flow a gaining stream otherwise it is called a losing stream wilson 1993 osman and bruen 2002 brunner et al 2009a 2009b in the gaining stream aquifer system the stream and groundwater are always completely connected in the losing stream aquifer system the connection between stream and groundwater is much more complicated for losing fully penetrating stream aquifer system osman and bruen 2002 jin et al 2017 water exchanges between the stream and aquifer are mostly through the fully saturated aquifer media and the stream and groundwater are completely connected too theis 1941 glover and balmer 1954 hantush 1965 wallace et al 1990 osman and bruen 2002 for losing partially penetrating stream aquifer system with groundwater level declining the system may evolve from a connected state to a transitional state and eventually to a disconnected state sophocleous 2002 osman and bruen 2002 brunner et al 2009a the clogging streambed peterson and wilson 1988 goldschneider et al 2007 treese et al 2009 can significantly affect the transition of a stream aquifer system from a connected state to a disconnected state or vice versa by imposing additional resistance to flow based on the assumption of one dimensional 1d steady state flow and the law of mass conservation fox and durnford 2003 solved the seepage rate of a stream and the capillary pressure head at the bottom of the clogging layer they pointed out that when the capillary pressure head gradient at the bottom of the clogging layer was equal to zero stream was under a critical state from transitional disconnection to complete disconnection brunner et al 2009a brunner et al 2009b constructed a stream aquifer connectivity theory and suggested that the stream aquifer system became completely disconnected when the top of the capillary zone was below the clogging layer some scholars argued that the existence of a clogging layer was a necessary condition for the disconnection of a stream aquifer system under steady state condition brunner et al 2009b xie et al 2014 however a series of studies show that three possible states of connection transitional and complete disconnection are also possible for an unclogged stream aquifer system reisenauer 1963 sophocleous 2002 wang et al 2011 2016 xie et al 2014 jin et al 2017 when an unclogged stream becomes completely disconnected the stream and groundwater in the underlying aquifer will have a hydraulic head difference and there will be an inverted saturated zone isz beneath the streambed reisenauer 1963 employed a variably saturated finite difference model simulating the distribution of water content and pressure head in a homogeneous soil beneath an unlined irrigation canal under steady state condition and clearly demonstrated the existence of an isz below the stream xie et al 2014 used numerical simulations to show that it was possible to have an isz in an unclogged stream under the steady state condition based on their theoretical analysis wang et al 2011 established a stream aquifer ditch sandbox model and utilized numerical simulations to confirm the existence of an isz beneath unclogged streams the dynamic isz and its front surface may exist in the stream groundwater system without clogging wang et al 2016 showed that the connected stream groundwater system with a constant stream stage can evolve to a disconnected state under the stimulation of river bank pumping which leads to a dynamic or time dependent isz and its front surface the dynamic isz and its front surface can exist in other conditions as well for example for a seasonal losing stream without clogging there is no water in the stream in the dry season thus an unsaturated zone is often formed beneath the streambed on the other hand there is water in the stream in the wet season thus a dynamic isz is formed beneath the streambed as suggested by xie et al 2014 a steady state isz may exist under constant stream stage conditions where the steady state isz is the final state of evolution of a dynamic isz after the lapse of a sufficiently long period of time however this is not to say that a stream aquifer system with a dynamic isz will necessarily develop into a steady state isz in summary isz is an indispensable component of an unclogged stream aquifer system but its evolutionary process is poorly understood up to present first of all the stream aquifer system without a clogging layer is different from the system with a clogging layer in the stream aquifer system with a clogging layer there is a blocking effect on the seepage in the sediment so the system evolution state from the connected state to the disconnected state is easier to quantify theoretically the evolution process of isz in the stream aquifer system without a clogging layer is dynamic so it is difficult to capture the whole evolution process of isz by using the steady state analysis method that is usually employed for investigating the stream aquifer system with a clogging layer secondly the limitations of classical saturated seepage theory see section 3 1 section 6 1 and section 6 2 make it difficult to accurately describe the dynamic evolution process of isz a better description of the evolutional characteristics of isz is of great significance for understanding the hydrodynamics solute transport and energy exchange in a stream aquifer system one of the keys to describe the evolution of isz is to capture the movement of isz frontal surface the purpose of this study is to develop an innovative isz model for an unclogged stream aquifer system with great attention paid to the isz frontal surface movement firstly the evolution mechanism of isz is described and the limitations of the free surface location at rwt iwt and the reasons for the failure of rwt iwt equation are illustrated secondly the free surface is located at the air entry surface and the reason for the mismatch of the water balance relationship at the free surface in the classical isz model green and ampt 1911 model and polubarinova kochina 1962 model is analyzed thirdly the free surface equation locating at ifs is reconstructed and the specific yield and infiltration rate are redefined based on this two analytical models describing the evolution of isz and their parameter estimation models are constructed and the solutions of two analytical models are compared with numerical simulations using hydrogeosphere hgs therrien et al 2010 finally the characteristics of isz evolution are analyzed by using sensitivity analysis method the general sketch of the paper is shown as fig 2 2 problem description to simplify the problem we will focus on investigating the one dimensional 1d cross sectional profile of a stream aquifer system before engaging in the more complex three dimensional 3d stream aquifer interaction the 2d simplification is acceptable when the stream is rather straight and streambed properties do not change dramatically along the stream channel with the scale of concern brunner 2009a b wang et al 2011 2016 xie et al 2014 due to the interplay of capillary force and gravity water discharged from isz will continue to expand around it horizontally and vertically until it reaches a steady state or disappears e g isz being connected to the regional saturation zone in this study however we assume that the horizontal expansion of the wetting front is secondary and negligible thus the problem essentially becomes one dimensional 1d only concerning vertical flow such a 1d approach is based on a number of considerations firstly the 1d approach will be applicable if the horizontal scale of isz is considerably larger than the vertical scale of concern for instance when the stream width is rather large in respect to the vertical scale of concern these conditions are not uncommon in seasonal losing streams for example in the wet season a dynamic isz is formed beneath the streambed and the thickness of the isz increases from zero to a finite value which could be much smaller than the stream width for deep aquifers the thickness of the isz may be much smaller than the width of the stream when the time of investigation is relatively short for shallow aquifers if the difference in elevation between the streambed and the regional water table is much smaller than the stream width the dynamic isz thickness which does not exceed the elevation difference is much smaller than the stream width as well we put this consideration to the test the test subject is a stream aquifer system with homogeneous and isotropic sediment in the four cases the stream stages are 0 4 m 0 8 m 2 m and 3 m the stream widths are 2 m 6 m 10 m and 20 m and corresponding the initial buried depth being half of the stream width respectively the result shows that it is acceptable to ignore the effect of horizontal capillary flux with details shown in section s1 in supporting materials another example for using the 1d approach is to investigate the evolutional process of surface water groundwater in an experimental setting using column tests secondly we are aware that the 1d simplification adopted here may be a concern for application of the theory in some real world setting particularly when discussing a narrow stream which require a 2d or 3d treatment thirdly field heterogeneity is not considered at the present investigation for the sake of simplicity and should be taken into consideration in further study in the future for instance the presence of multiple soil layers with different hydraulic parameters or the presence of clay silt lenses and macropores could impose profound impact on the evolutional process of stream aquifer interaction such heterogeneities cannot be handled by the 1d approach of this investigation and requires a 2d and or 3d approach a task that deserves great attention in future investigations finally the use of 1d approach makes it possible to compare this investigation with previous analytical investigations which are almost always in 1d setting in general one should regard this investigation as a first step of developing a novel theory involving an isz in an unclogged losing stream and further investigations are needed to make it applicable in a heterogeneous 3d real world setting we will investigate a seasonal losing stream which includes a dry season during which the stream channel holds no water and a wet season during which the stream channel holds water in the dry season an unsaturated zone is formed between the streambed and the regional water table in the wet season the stream can be described as a prescribed head dirichlet boundary condition and a dynamic isz is formed beneath the stream for a stream stage being relatively stable during the time span of interest a constant head infiltration model may be applicable as shown in fig 3 the conventional definition of isz is the zone from the bottom of stream to the inverted water table iwt at which the pressure head is 0 the iwt equation has the same form as the regional water table rwt equation when we attempt to use the equation established for rwt in conventional unconfined aquifer flow theory bear 1972 to describe the isz frontal surface motion a number of problems are found in section 6 1 we have reduced the iwt equation having the same form as rwt equation to three forms the iwt equation based on abrupt interface assumption the iwt equation based on modified specific yield and the general form of iwt equation the assumption of abrupt interface is that the free surface is an abrupt interface between air and water in the void space bear 1972 the iwt equation based on the assumption of abrupt interface will lead to physically unrealistic spatial variables which can be confirmed by the green and ampt 1911 model and the polubarinova kochina 1962 model when the iwt equation is modified to conform to the physical reality considering the existence of capillary saturation zone under iwt one can see that the elevation of iwt is time independent such issues will be discussed in details in section 6 1 1 and section 6 2 the iwt equation based on the modified specific yield bear 1972 freeze and cherry 1979 uses the variation of water content within the water table shifting range and the variation of water content in the unsaturated zone outside water table to represent the drainage or storage water capacity of sediment within the water table shifting range which is inappropriate the iwt equation based on modified specific yield also causes physically unrealistic spatial variables which can be confirmed by the green and ampt 1911 model and the polubarinova kochina 1962 model with appropriate modifications this is also discussed in details in section 6 1 2 and section 6 2 the conclusion deduced from the general form of iwt equation is that iwt shifting is driven only by the infiltration rate and such an iwt equation is also problematic as discussed in details in section 6 1 3 the problem with above three forms of iwt equations directly extended from conventional unconfined aquifer flow theory motivates us to develop a physically sound new set of iwt equation the concept of this new iwt equation is explained as follows there is an inverted capillary saturation zone icz from iwt to a depth at which the pressure head equals the air entry pressure ha as shown in fig 3 the icz is also completely saturated just like isz above iwt but with negative pressure heads this motivates us to revisit the flow dynamics associated with an isz by moving the free surface of isz from iwt to the lower end of icz in other words the revised isz includes two sections section a is the saturated region from the bottom of stream to iwt in which pressure heads are positive while section b is icz in which pressure heads are negative regardless of their differences in pressure heads section a and section b are both completely saturated thus one can use darcy s law with a saturated hydraulic conductivity to compute the water flux from now on the isz always refers to the combination of section a and section b discussed above the region below isz is partially saturated and requires an unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and the darcy buckingham law or the darcy s law for unsaturated flow to calculate flux this modification is of course based on a presumption that the hydraulic conductivity is only dependent on the degree of saturation if this presumption cannot hold then one cannot use the approach proposed here for most sediments encountered below the unclogged streams this presumption is valid the newly defined isz will become the same as previously used isz if the air entry pressure is zero or section b completely disappears in fact air entry pressure is usually finite for most soil types brooks and corey 1964 van genuchten 1980 the lower boundary of isz is called the isz frontal surface ifs where pressure head equals to air entry value hereinafter as shown in fig 3 because ifs is the interface between saturated and unsaturated water contents the movement of ifs is closely related to the unsaturated zone as described in section 3 2 because of the shift of lower free boundary of saturated flow from iwt to ifs the equation for describing such a free boundary needs to be developed first 3 theoretical basis 3 1 inverted saturated zone model we will first derive the ifs equation in a general 3d framework and then simplify the equation for the 1d case in this section there are two reasons to derive the ifs equation in a general 3d framework despite the fact that this study is focused on the 1d case firstly the established 3d framework makes it straightforward to expand the 1d investigation of this study to 2d and or 3d investigations that will be carried out on the basis of this study secondly the 1d equation that will be discussed in details below actually cannot be directly extended to 2d or 3d frameworks the lower limit of the isz model is set up on ifs which is the interface between saturated and unsaturated water content and the ifs shift will alter the sediment water content in the shifting range in the following we will establish a differential equation describing the ifs movement in a general 3d setting for the uniformity of developing a general 3d theory in the near future following this 1d study at ifs the hydraulic head h is 1 h x y z t z h a where x and y are horizontal coordinates in two orthogonal directions respectively cm the z axis is positive upward and the origin of the coordinate system is at the boundary of the streambed and the underneath sediment cm ha is the air entry head which is a negative value cm t is time s for a moving ifs one has the implicit equation f of the ifs as follows 2 f x y z t h x y z t z h a 0 because the water content at ifs is saturated it has no more storage space or no extra space to store water and water flowing into the surface per unit area is equal to the water flowing out per unit area a point to note is that the storativity due to elasticity of media and water is too small to be included here unless one is dealing with mostly clayey porous media from a practical standpoint this study concerns more permeable porous media types so that sizable downward seepage below the streambed is possible to occur and it does not concern too much about a clayey porous media because such media will effectively block any downward seepage due to its extremely small permeability value in another word the drainage effect plays a dominating role while the storage effect is secondary and negligible hereinafter nevertheless based on the water flow balance principle stated above one has 3 μ ha v n w n v n where μ ha is the specific yield at ifs cm3 cm3 w is the infiltration rate vector w w k cm s w is the infiltration rate cm s a negative w signifies the downward water movement from isz to sediment below ifs while a positive w signifies the upward water movement from sediment below ifs to isz v n is the moving velocity of ifs cm s v n is water flowing out from isz to ifs per unit area or specific discharge cm s the significance of eq 3 is that a certain portion of water flowing out of ifs increases the water volume within the ifs shifting range and rest portion flows out as discharge combining eq 2 and eq 3 a differential equation for the ifs can be established with details shown in section s2 in supporting materials 4 μ ha h t k x h x 2 k y h y 2 k z h z 2 k z w h z w where kx ky and kz are the saturated hydraulic conductivities in the x y and z directions respectively cm s for the 1d case eq 4 can be written as 5 μ ha h t k z h z 2 k z w h z w eq 5 can be linearized by omitting the quadratic term on the right hand side of eq 5 such a linearization has been broadly used before in dealing with free interfaces in porous media flow and one may see detailed discussions about this matter in bear 1972 1979 after the linearization one has 6 μ ha h t k z w h z w two points should be noted about eqs 5 and 6 being used in 1d constant head infiltration condition firstly the specific yield μha represents the drainage or storage capacity of the soil column in the ifs shifting range the specific yield is redefined at ifs as the volumetric water change in the sediment column in ifs shifting range over a unit area when ifs falls by a unit height due to gravity shown as fig 4 according to the definition of μha the water volume change δvμ within the ifs shifting range is used to calculate the specific yield 7 μ ha δ v μ a δ z ha where a is the unit horizontal free surface area cm2 δ z ha is the change in the ifs elevation cm the second point is about the infiltration rate w at ifs which is defined as the amount of water flowing out of isz through ifs per unit area per unit time due to gravity and capillary force shown as fig 4 depending on the buried depth of rwt the extended wetting zone may be influenced by the regional saturation zone or not the water flowing out of isz may be stored in the extended wetting zone or in both the extended wetting zone and the regional saturation zone which will influence the quantification of the w term if the water flowing out of isz is only stored in the extended wetting zone shown as fig 4 the water volume change δv w within the extended wetting zone can be used to calculate the w term shown as eq 8 a if the water flowing out of isz is stored in both the extended wetting zone and the regional saturation zone the quantification of the water volume flowing out of isz and the w term which is time dependent becomes more challenging nevertheless one may still use the following eq 8 b which is simply a reorganization of above eq 6 to compute w provided that the terms on the right hand side of eq 8 b can be determined accurately 8 a w δ v w a δ t 8 b w μ ha h t k z h z 1 h z where δ t is the change in time s 3 2 solving the inverted saturated zone model 3 2 1 the inverted saturated zone model under 1d condition a 1d analysis can capture the main characteristics of isz evolution shown as fig 5 supposing that there is a seasonal losing stream at the end of the dry season or the start of the wet season the system is under hydrostatic condition the stream stage rises rapidly from 0 to a constant value of d 0 in the wet season generating a dynamic isz beneath the streambed the isz model can be then written as 9 a z k z h z 0 z h a z 0 0 t 9 b h z t t 0 z z h a 0 z h a 0 d 0 z h a 0 h a z h a 0 h a 9 c h z t z 0 d 0 9 d h z t z z h a z ha h a 9 e μ ha h t k z w h z w where eq 9 a is the continuity equation of flow bear 1972 which means the hydraulic head being a linear equation of z in isz eq 9 b is the hydraulic head profile in isz at initial time being derived based on eqs 9 a 9 c and 9 d t is the local time after the instantaneous rise of the stream stage from 0 to d 0 s zha is the ifs depth zha 0 cm zha 0 is the ifs depth at the starting time zha 0 0 cm according to eqs 7 and 8 a it can be found that the specific yield μha and infiltration rate w depend on the pressure head profile or water content profile of unsaturated zone under ifs as these two profiles change with the development of seepage process the specific yield μha and infiltration rate w are time dependent at the same time the pressure head profile or water content profile of unsaturated zone is affected by the initial conditions of seepage boundary conditions lithology seepage duration and other factors which also affect the specific yield μha and infiltration rate w therefore it is unrealistic to obtain the relationship between the specific yield μha or infiltration rate w and time in the framework that only concerns saturated flow indeed this is the limitation of saturated flow theory associated with isz or unconfined aquifer analysis if one insists on solving the problem within the framework of the conventional saturated flow theory in an approximate sense the following three strategies may be helpful firstly the empirical formulae of the specific yield μha and time and the infiltration rate w and time under different hydrogeological conditions may be obtained by extensive tests for solving the ifs equation eq 9 e this treatment is similar to the soil water characteristic curve empirical model brooks corey model brooks and corey 1964 or van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 secondly in order to simplify the solution of ifs equation the specific yield μha and the infiltration rate w are assumed to be constants to represent the temporally averaged values of the specific yield μha and the infiltration rate w over the temporal scale of concern and such temporally averaged μha and w may be obtained using an inverse process of parameter estimation thirdly the analytic solution of ifs motion can be obtained by using the simplified richards equation charbeneau 2000 without solving the ifs equation eq 9 e however the simplified richards equation charbeneau 2000 only considers the gravity term and ignores the diffusive term which will lead to errors in describing the ifs motion which means that the parameters of the simplified richards equation must be adjusted if one expects to minimize the error therefore it is recommended to use a parameter estimation process to determine the adjusted parameters associated with the simplified richards equation so as to obtain a relatively accurate ifs motion process in such a parameter estimation process the specific yield μha is assumed as a constant first but the infiltration rate w can be time dependent in the following analysis we will use the second and third strategies to solve the ifs movement and the hydraulic head profiles in isz within the saturated flow framework which are named the analytical solution for a constant w and a time dependent w respectively 3 2 2 the analytical solution for a constant w based on eqs 9 a 9 c and 9 d the hydraulic head of isz is 10 h d 0 h a z ha z ha z d 0 by substituting eqs 9 d and 10 into eq 9 e and considering the fact that at the initial time zha zha 0 one has the simplified ifs differential equation shown as eq s11 in section s3 in supporting materials when the constant specific yield μha and the constant infiltration rate w are used the ifs depth can be derived from eq s11 in section s3 in supporting materials as 11 z ha k z w d 0 h a ln k z w d 0 h a k z z ha k z w d 0 h a k z z h a 0 k z k z μ ha t z h a 0 substituting eq 11 into eq 10 one can obtain the analytical solution for the hydraulic head profile of isz 3 2 3 the analytical solution for a time dependent w to obtain an analytical solution with a time dependent w term the following simplifications are introduced when the water content is close to saturation gravity is the dominating driving force of flow as compared to capillary force therefore the diffusion term of eq 12 a can be neglected and the partial differential equation for unsaturated flow can be written as eq 12 b charbeneau 2000 12 a θ t z d θ θ z k θ z 12 b θ t k θ z where d θ is capillary diffusivity cm2 s k θ is the hydraulic conductivity of the unsaturated zone cm s as an example of illustration the soil water characteristic curve is assumed to follow the brooks corey model brooks and corey 1964 13 s e θ θ r θ s θ r h a h λ h h a 1 h h a where θ s is the saturation water content cm3 cm3 θ r is the residual water content cm3 cm3 h a is the air entry head cm λ is a brooks corey model parameter called the pore size distribution index dimensionless the hydraulic conductivity function follows the burdine model burdine 1953 brooks and corey 1964 1966 14 k s e k z s e 2 3 λ λ where se is the effective saturation cm3 cm3 k se is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity cm s we need to emphasize that the use of eqs 12 and 13 is only for the purpose of illustration other types of equations if proven to be better for describing the soil water characteristic curve and the soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity can be employed as well by substituting eqs 13 and 14 into eq 12 b the ifs with θ θ s shift can be derived as 15 z h a z h a 0 2 3 λ k z λ θ s θ r t the derivation and discussion of eq 15 are given in section s4 in supporting materials substituting eq 15 into eq 10 the hydraulic head profile of isz can be derived as 16 h 1 λ θ s θ r d 0 h a z h a 0 λ θ s θ r 2 3 λ k z t z d 0 substituting eq 15 into eq s11 a in section s3 in supporting materials the infiltration rate w is 17 w z ha μ ha 2 3 λ k z λ θ s θ r k z d 0 h a z ha d 0 h a 4 materials and methods in order to test the analytical model developed above a numerical saturated unsaturated flow model using hydrogeosphere hgs was developed to calculate the hydraulic head profile and compared with the above analytical model since the specific yield μha is assumed to be constant in the two analytical models and the infiltration rate can be time independent or time dependent as mentioned in the aforementioned second and third strategies in section 3 2 1 we need to establish two different parameter estimation models to estimate the parameters involved in such two analytical models such estimated parameters include the specific yield initial ifs depth infiltration rate saturated water content residual water content air entry head and pore size distribution index we introduce the parameter estimation models in details in section s5 1 in supporting materials in the hgs model the soil layer thickness was set to be 200 cm the reference surface was the streambed and the initial hydraulic head was computed using the hydrostatic condition the upper boundary was the constant head boundary with a hydraulic head of 40 cm the lower boundary was the regional water table which is 200 cm below the streambed two floridian soils fine sand and fine sandy loam were used carlisle et al 1989 tested the soil characteristics water retention data and the physical soil parameters of these two soil types are shown in table 1 nachabe 2002 for the mulat fine sandy loam and mulat fine sand the observation points were at depths of 4 cm and 10 cm below the streambed for the parameter estimation model with a time independent w the starting and ending times of observation were respectively t 0 24 hr and t 10 74 hr for the mulat fine sandy loam and t 0 24 hr was set as the initial time for the parameter estimation model this was the local time tlocal 0 for the initial ifs depth zha 0 the starting and ending times for the mulat fine sand were respectively t 0 12 hr and t 5 7 hr and the t 0 12 hr was set as the initial time time steps were 0 06 hr data points at 176 time steps for the mulat fine sandy loam and 94 time steps for the mulat fine sand were collected for the parameter estimation model with time dependent w eq 15 shows that the ifs depth and time are linearly related however the observed ifs depth through the parameter estimation model and time were obviously nonlinear at the early stage to avoid the nonlinearity at early stage the starting time for parameter estimation model was push back and the new starting and ending times of observation were respectively t 2 04 hr and t 10 74 hr for the mulat fine sandy loam and t 2 04 hr was set as the initial time for the parameter estimation model the new starting and ending times for the mulat fine sand were respectively t 1 08 hr and t 5 7 hr and the t 1 08 hr was set as the initial time time steps were 0 06 hr data points at 146 time steps for the mulat fine sandy loam and 78 time steps for the mulat fine sand were collected extensive numerical exercises were conducted to make sure that the results of numerical simulations were not affected by the chosen spatiotemporal discretization mesh to test the rationality of the analytical models and the robustness of the parameter estimation models the hydraulic heads of the observation points computed using hgs were used as inputs in the parameter estimation model to estimate the parameters with both time independent and time dependent w schemes the parameter values estimated using analytical model will be compared with the original input parameter values in hgs finally results of the hydraulic head profiles computed using the analytical and hgs models will be compared we have documented the comparison in details in section s5 2 in supporting materials 5 results the evolution of isz in the sediment beneath the streambed is controlled by the ifs shifting in this section we only show the ifs shifting process of two floridian soils and compare the ifs shifting processes calculated by analytical models and the hgs models as part of the comparison of the parameter estimation models we put the evolution of hydraulic head in isz in section s5 2 in supporting materials fig 6 shows the development of the ifs depth zha in fig 6 the gold line is the values of zha computed using the numerical model of hgs the orange line is the values of zha computed using the analytical model with a constant w and the gray line is the values of zha computed using the analytical model with a variable w in the early stage the zha value increases nonlinearly with time after the early stage the zha value starts to increase with time in an approximately linear fashion fig 6 shows that for the case of constant w the zha values computed using the analytical model match closely with the zha values computed using numerical model of hgs with only small discrepancies at the end of the simulation period overall the match of the analytical and numerical models with a constant w is better than that with a variable w and the match of the analytical and numerical models with variable w is better for the mulat fine sandy loam fig 6 a than for the mulat fine sand fig 6 b 6 discussion 6 1 discussion of iwt equation the iwt equation and the regional water table rwt equation have the same mathematical form and physical function the difference of iwt from rwt in an unconfined aquifer is that the relative positions of saturated versus unsaturated zones are opposite thus gravity drainage will attempt to pull the iwt towards the underneath unsaturated zone while gravity drainage will attempt to pull the rwt away from the upper unsaturated zone in this section three previously mentioned iwt equations with different physical meanings are discussed which are respectively called iwt equation based on abrupt interface assumption type 1 iwt equation based on modified specific yield type 2 and the general formula of iwt equation type 3 for convenience of discussion the constant head infiltration model described in section 3 2 is applied the difference is that the free surface boundary is set at iwt as shown in fig 7 the general formula of iwt equation is written as 18 μ h t k z w h z w 6 1 1 the type 1 iwt equation based on abrupt interface assumption according to the assumption of neglecting the presence of moisture above or outside the free surface e g in the capillary fringe and assume that the free surface is an abrupt interface between air and water in the void space bear 1972 the influence of the change of water volume in the unsaturated zone on the water balance at iwt is not considered in type 1 iwt equation this is similar with the assumption utilized in the green and ampt 1911 model and the polubarinova kochina 1962 model in which the free surface wetting front is a sharp boundary dividing initial soil moisture below from saturated soil in this case because the water flowing out of isz through iwt is ignored the infiltration rate w is 0 thus eq 18 can be written as 19 μ h t k z h z when the negative pressure head of the free surface boundary in these two models is 0 the free surface boundary is iwt however the abrupt interface assumption is not physically realistic due to the interplay of capillary force and gravity there exists a capillary saturation zone below iwt and this zone shifts along with the moving iwt in other words at any two adjacent moments with a sufficiently short period of time the iwt moving range is always completely saturated therefore the term associated with the specific yield i e the storage change is 0 and eq 19 should be written as 20 a 0 k z h z 20 b h c where c is constant eq 20 indicates that the elevation of iwt is time independent thus eq 19 cannot accurately depict the motion of a free surface boundary 6 1 2 the type 2 iwt equation based on the modified specific yield the type 2 iwt equation involves a modification of the specific yield to a modified specific yield denoted as μ to correct eq 19 where μ is defined as the volume of water released by gravity from the soil column per unit area extending to the ground surface from the water table when the water table declines by one unit of depth bear 1972 the μ term defined in such a manner is time dependent if μ is applied to the iwt equation the upper boundary is located at iwt and the lower boundary is located at the lower boundary of the wetting zone below iwt that is the computational domain includes the iwt shifting range and the extended wetting zone in the unsaturated zone shown as fig 8 a due to the fact that μ includes the change of water volume in the iwt shifting region and the extended zone the infiltration rate w should be zero thus eq 18 can be written as 21 μ h t k z h z however eq 21 is problematic as well the main reason is that the change of water volume in the wetting zone below iwt is regarded as part of the specific yield so as to ensure the water balance at iwt actually the wetting zone is located outside the iwt shifting range and the change of water volume in the wetting zone is caused by the change of capillary force and gravity in the zone below the iwt shifting range thus the water stored in iwt and water infiltration in the zone below the iwt shifting range are not physically compatible the specific yield defined in this way thus becomes physically questionable we can use the green and ampt 1911 model and the polubarinova kochina 1962 model as examples to illustrate this matter further before doing so we need to slightly modify the green and ampt 1911 model and the polubarinova kochina 1962 model to conform to the modified specific yield concept here when μ is used to describe the modified green and ampt 1911 model and the polubarinova kochina 1962 model the free surface equation can be written as eq 21 with pressure head of free surface being equal to zero in both models the modified green and ampt 1911 model and the polubarinova kochina 1962 model lead to physically questionable results of the depth of free surface shown as section 6 2 6 1 3 the type 3 general form of iwt equation when the change of water volume in the wetting zone under the iwt shifting range is considered as the non zero infiltration rate w the iwt equation shown in fig 7 should be written as eq 18 the computational domain only involves the iwt shifting range as shown in fig 8 b due to the existence of a capillary saturation zone below iwt at any two adjacent moments with a sufficiently short period of time the water content maintains saturated in the iwt shifting range and the term associated with the specific yield i e the storage change equals to zero thus eq 18 should be written as 22 0 k z w h z w eq 22 indicates that iwt shifting is driven only by the infiltration rate w comparison of eq 18 and 22 indicates that the general formula of iwt equation eq 18 is inconsistent with eq 22 in which the term on the left side of eq 18 becomes redundant 6 2 discussion of the green and ampt 1911 model and polubarinova kochina 1962 model green and ampt 1911 developed a 1d constant head infiltration model to study the evolution process of the isz in a homogeneous isotropy sediment under the condition of ponded water on the soil surface polubarinova kochina 1962 used this model to study the evolution process of isz under the condition of reservoir seepage both models assume the same condition for water balance at free surface boundary wetting front i e the free surface is a sharp boundary dividing initial soil moisture below from the saturated soil above the free surface equations in both models are the same in this section the free surface equation from the polubarinova kochina 1962 model is discussed shown as fig 9 the base level of the model is at the bottom of the reservoir the vertical coordinate is positive downwards represented by z a point to note is that the z axis direction of polubarinova kochina 1962 is opposite of the z axis direction of this study see fig 5 but this does not affect the conclusions the water level of the reservoir is h and other physical quantities are shown as fig 9 the differential equation of the free surface given by polubarinova kochina 1962 is shown in eq 23 a and the transcendental equation of the free surface is shown in eq 23 b polubarinova kochina 1962 attempted to use this model to describe two situations where the free surface boundary is at iwt shown as fig 9 and at the base of isz shown as eq 23 when the capillary height in eq 23 is ignored i e hk 0 the isz front of the polubarinova kochina 1962 model is located at iwt for the convenience of comparison the symbols used in this section are the same as those used in polubarinova kochina 1962 s original text if the symbol used by polubarinova kochina 1962 is the same as those used in this article we add a sign of to the symbol used by polubarinova kochina 1962 to single it out 23 a m d z 0 dt k h h k z 0 z 0 23 b z 0 h h k ln 1 z 0 h h k kt m h h k where z 0 is the depth of free surface cm k is the saturated hydraulic conductivity in the z direction cm s m is the porosity cm3 cm3 hk is the capillary height cm comparing eq 23 a with eq 18 it can be found that the porosity m or more precisely the drainable porosity is used to replace the specific yield which is constant and the infiltration rate is set to 0 in the polubarinova kochina 1962 model in order to further analyze the polubarinova kochina 1962 solution the ranges of parameter values in eq 23 is discussed in fig 9 the vertical coordinate is positive downward thus 24 z 0 0 according to eq 23 a the depth of ifs under steady state can be obtained as 25 z 0 st h h k 0 where z 0 st is the depth of the free surface under steady state condition cm the value of h and h k see the section s6 in supporting materials eq 25 is in contrast to eq 24 meaning that the polubarinova kochina 1962 solution is problematic and appears to be physically impossible when the modified specific yield μ is used to describe the modified green and ampt 1911 model and the polubarinova kochina 1962 model it is necessary to replace m with μ in eq 23 a for μ d z 0 dt k h h k z 0 z 0 the same conclusion can still be derived under steady state condition on the other hand even if we disregard the physically unrealistic problem of the polubarinova kochina 1962 solution this model still cannot accurately describe the ifs migration the depth of the ifs under steady state condition is the maximum depth that isz can reach which equals to the water level of reservoir plus the capillary height in the polubarinova kochina 1962 solution in other words the depth of the ifs should not be larger than z 0 st for the mulat fine sandy loam z 0 st is 79 1 cm for the mulat fine sand z 0 st is 69 2 cm however the depths of the isz fronts simulated by hgs exceeded z 0 st for the mulat fine sandy loam and the mulat fine sand as shown in fig 6 to sum up if the free surface boundary of the green and ampt 1911 model or the polubarinova kochina 1962 model is set at iwt hk 0 the above discussion proves that the iwt equation based on the assumed abrupt interface in section 6 1 1 and the iwt equation in section 6 1 2 are not self consistent or contradictory with each other if the free surface boundary of the green and ampt 1911 model or the polubarinova kochina 1962 model is set at ifs hk ha the above discussion confirms that the influence of the change of water volume in the zone below the shifting range of ifs on the water balance of ifs should not be ignored otherwise the water balance requirement is not satisfied at ifs 6 3 ifs motion with constant w 6 3 1 the range of w the infiltration rate discussed in this study indicates the capacity of water flow from isz through the ifs to the underneath sediments analyzing the range of w is helpful to capture the characteristics of a dynamic ifs eq 11 describes the development of the ifs position versus time with a constant specific yield and a constant infiltration rate which are in an approximate sense being respectively the temporally averaged values of the specific yield μha and the infiltration rate w over the temporal scale of concern to use this equation properly several constraints must be noticed firstly the term inside the logarithmic function in eq 11 has to be positive otherwise eq 11 will give an imaginary or undefined value which is clearly incorrect secondly the depth of the ifs should not be less than the initial depth of ifs and the rate of change of the depth of ifs should increase with isz development with the stream seepage without other sources or sinks in the system see fig 5 thirdly the saturated hydraulic conductivity kz the ifs depth zha the initial ifs depth zha 0 the stream stage d 0 and the specific yield μ ha are no less than zero and the air entry head ha is less than zero based on these constraints one can determine the range of w as 26 k z z h a 0 d 0 h a k z w 0 the detailed derivation of eq 26 is shown in the section s7 in supporting materials 6 3 2 the ifs depth with a constant w the depth of the ifs under steady state condition z ha st is the maximum depth that isz can reach in a losing stream groundwater system with the streambed seepage being the only source of water the analysis of the characteristics of the ifs depth in steady state condition can serve as a baseline to further revealing the evolution of a steam groundwater system under the steady state infiltration rate according to eq 9 e eq s11 a in section s3 in supporting materials and z ha t 0 the depth of ifs z ha st can be written as 27 z ha st k z w d 0 h a k z according to eq 27 one can find that the stream stage air entry head and saturated hydraulic conductivity will affect the maximum depth of ifs with a constant w analyzing the first derivative of the controlling factor of a physical term of concern can reflect the rate of change of such a term to the change of that controlling factor while the positive and negative signs of such a first derivative can reflect the direction of the correlation between the physical term and its controlling factor ye and shen 2006 liu et al 2016 cheng et al 2020 when the first derivative of the stream stage d 0 is used in eq 27 then according to eq 26 and the third constrain in section 6 3 1 the influence of the stream stage d 0 on the depth z ha st can be analyzed as follows 28 i f k z z h a 0 d 0 h a k z w k z z ha st d 0 k z w k z 0 i f w k z z ha st d 0 k z w k z 0 i f k z w 0 z ha st d 0 k z w k z 0 where z ha st is the maximum isz depth at a given stream stage eq 28 indicates that the maximum ifs depth may increase or decrease monotonously with increasing stream stage when the first derivative of the air entry head value ha is used in eq 27 then according to eq 26 and the third constrain in section 6 3 1 the influence of the air entry head value ha on the depth z ha st can be analyzed as follows 29 i f k z z h a 0 d 0 h a k z w k z z ha st h a k z w k z 0 i f w k z z ha st h a k z w k z 0 i f k z w 0 z ha st h a k z w k z 0 eq 29 indicates that the maximum ifs depth may increase or decrease monotonously with the absolute values of the increasing air entry head when the first derivative of saturated hydraulic conductivity kz is used in eq 27 then according to eq 26 and the third constrain in section 6 3 1 the influence of the saturation hydraulic conductivity kz on the depth z ha st can be analyzed as 30 z ha st k z w k z 2 d 0 h a 0 eq 30 indicates that an increase in the saturated hydraulic conductivity will lead to decrease of the maximum isz depth in summary the maximum depth of ifs is negatively correlated with the saturated hydraulic conductivity and may be positively or negatively correlated with stream stage and air entry head value depending on the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the infiltration rate the results of the analysis suggest that the influence of these factors should be considered cohesively instead of relying on a single factor in regulating the development of isz 6 3 3 development of the ifs depth the ifs depth zha should increase with the isz development in the system as clearly seen in the first derivative or slope of zha versus time in fig 6 we can further analyze the characteristics of zha using the second derivative of zha versus time indeed first derivative and second derivative analysis have been proven to be very effective in analyzing transient well testing pressure data in petroleum engineering and hydrological sciences ehlig economides 1988 dejam et al 2018 analyzing the second derivative of the controlling factor of a physical term of concern can reflect the tendency of the rate of change of the term of concern the second derivative together with the first derivative are powerful diagnostic tools for investigating a dynamical system involving multiple controlling parameters ye and shen 2006 liu et al 2016 cheng et al 2020 according to eq 9 e and eq s11 a in section s3 in supporting materials the second derivative of time t of the ifs depth is 31 2 z ha t 2 1 μ ha 2 k z w 2 d 0 h a 2 z ha 3 k z k z w d 0 h a z ha 2 according to eq 31 and the third constrain in section 6 3 1 eq 31 can be analyzed as follows when k z w 0 there is 32 2 z ha t 2 1 μ ha 2 k z w 2 d 0 h a 2 z ha 3 1 k z z ha k z w d 0 h a 0 for this mode zha increases with time t but the rate of change gradually slows down with time as shown by curve i in fig 10 when w k z 33 2 z ha t 2 0 and 34 z ha t k z μ ha for this mode zha increases with time t at a constant rate of k z μ ha as shown in curve ii of fig 10 when k z z h a 0 d 0 h a k z w k z 35 2 z ha t 2 1 μ ha 2 k z w 2 d 0 h a 2 z ha 3 1 k z z ha k z w d 0 h a 0 for this mode zha increases with time t and the rate of change gradually increases as well as shown by curve iii in fig 10 in summary fig 10 indicates that the ifs depth can have three distinctively different evolutional modes depending on different ranges of the constant w values 6 3 4 the development of streambed seepage flux the streambed seepage of a losing stream is a key factor in water resources management thus delineation of the streambed flux characteristics of a losing stream is of great significance to guide the development and utilization of water resources and the sustainable management of interconnected ecosystems fox and durnford 2003 brunner et al 2009a 2009b fleckenstein et al 2010 the streambed flux of the unclogged stream is equal to the seepage flux of isz in combination with eq 10 the streambed flux q of an unclogged stream can be expressed as 36 q k z h z k z d 0 h a z ha 1 due to the development of a dynamic ifs zha as shown in section 6 3 3 and the third constrain in section 6 3 1 h z decreases with time and reaches a minimum value when seepage becomes stable consequently the streambed flux q decreases with time as well and will eventually arrive at its stable minimum value furthermore similar to what has been seen in fig 10 the decreasing trend of the streambed flux also has three modes the rate of change of the streambed flux can either gradually decline or remain constant or gradually increase with time 6 4 limitations of the solutions 6 4 1 limitations of solution with variable w the partial differential equation ignoring the diffusion term charbeneau 2000 for unsaturated flow can be used to derive the depth evolution equation for ifs zha as shown in eq 15 the first derivative of zha versus time is 37 z h a t 2 3 λ k z λ θ s θ r 2 k z λ θ s θ r 3 k z θ s θ r because the pore distribution index λ the saturated hydraulic conductivity kz and the differences between the saturated and residual water content θ s θ r are all positive constants eq 37 is a constant positive value this means that zha always increases with time so the infiltration process resembles a downward piston flow with a uniform velocity according to eq 37 the main factors influencing ifs are λ kz and θ s θ r the value of λ reflects the influence of the pore size distribution on the soil water characteristic curve and a larger λ value means a more uniform pore size distribution xie 2015 the value of θ s θ r reflects the largest water storage space per unit volume of soil eq 37 indicates that the ifs depth develops with time in a slower rate in soils with a more uniform pore size distribution and or a larger water storage space a larger kz means a more permeable soil thus a higher specific discharge or infiltration rate under the same hydraulic head gradient eq 37 indicates that the ifs depth develops more rapidly in a soil with a higher saturated hydraulic conductivity 6 4 2 limitations of this study the paper uses idealized geometries and boundary conditions and identifies basic principles and mechanisms rather than solutions for specific field problems the focus of this study is to reconstruct a basic theory of evolution of a stream aquifer system based on a conceptual model with a few controlling factors first and then to build up a more comprehensive and complex theory incorporating more realistic and most likely heterogeneous system later without the basic theory of this study it is very difficult or even impossible to develop the comprehensive theory eventually this basic theory includes contents analyzing the limitations of the classical saturated seepage theory and the classical isz model see section 2 6 1 and 6 2 calibrating the position of the free surface redefining the specific yield and infiltration rate and reconstructing the equation of the free surface see section 3 1 however this study also has a number of limitations that deserve further attention in the future investigations those limitations are briefly summarized as follows 1 this paper focuses on the evolution of isz under 1d infiltration scenario which is applicable to the assumed conditions set in section 3 1 this study can also be used to track the evolution of the frontal point of the 2d axisymmetric isz profile however this study only considers the influence of vertical capillary flux when this study is extended to 2d or 3d infiltration schemes the influence of horizontal capillary flux should be considered stream stage is an important driving force for isz evolution in the stream aquifer system in this study the constant stream stage assumption is adopted the natural stream stage is time dependent and its influence on the evolution of isz needs to be considered in future work 2 this study is based on the saturated seepage theory and the specific yield is treated as a constant therefore the influence of time dependent specific yield on the evolution of isz cannot be reflected in the solution soil homogeneity is assumed in this conceptual model and it should be relaxed to include soil heterogeneity such as layering and preferential flow pathways in the future 3 this study relies mostly on an analytical approach to address the concept and theoretical frameworks for a simplified stream aquifer system the analytical approach is probably not favorable for dealing with complex processes of real world stream aquifer interaction when considering transiency field heterogeneity three dimensionality which may require a carefully designed numerical model one optimal approach is to develop the theoretic framework using analytical modeling first which is the present work and then to apply the theory to realistic problems using complex numerical models which is our next phase of research 7 summary and conclusions in the paper the theoretical basis of isz evolution analysis in an unclogged stream aquifer system is established and the evolution characteristics of isz in a seasonal losing stream aquifer system is analyzed based on a detailed analysis of the limitations of the free surface equation locating at rwt or iwt in the present saturated flow theory and the isz model developed by green and ampt 1911 or polubarinova kochina 1962 this study reconstructs the free surface equation redefines the specific yield and infiltration rate and modifies the isz model of green and ampt 1911 or polubarinova kochina 1962 compared with the numerical solution the robustness of the new model is verified finally sensitivity analysis is used to reveal the evolution characteristics of isz the paper uses idealized geometries and boundary conditions and identifies basic principles and mechanisms rather than solutions for specific field problems the key findings of the paper are the free surface equation in the classical saturated theory is not self consistent locating the free surface of aquifer at rwt or the free surface of isz at iwt lacks a solid theoretical basis the primary limitation of the classical isz model developed by green and ampt 1911 or polubarinova kochina 1962 is that the water balance requirement is not satisfied at ifs which results in physically unrealistic spatial variables the free surface of aquifer or isz should be located at the air entry surface in the new isz model the specific yield is redefined at ifs as the volumetric water change in the sediment column in ifs shifting range over a unit area when ifs falls by a unit height due to gravity infiltration rate w is defined as the amount of water flowing out of isz through ifs per unit area per unit time due to gravity and capillary force to solve the isz model within the framework of the conventional saturated flow theory an approximate treatment of specific yield and infiltration rate is required in this paper solutions of isz model with the specific yield being assumed as a constant and the infiltration rate being assumed as a constant or being time dependent are suggested the parameter estimation models are constructed based on these two solutions the newly obtained solutions are tested against the numerical simulation results using hgs with satisfaction the analytical solution with a constant w is better than the solution with a variable w based on the analytical solution with a constant w the evolution characteristics of isz are captured the isz frontal surface exhibits three modes of motion with different infiltration rate w i e the isz frontal surface burial depth increases with time with a an increasing rate b a constant rate and c a decreasing rate the maximum ifs depth decreases with the increasing saturation hydraulic conductivity and is linearly correlated with the stream stage and sediment air entry head the hydraulic head gradient behind the ifs decreases with time and reaches a minimum value with a constant infiltration rate w the streambed flux decreases with time and also exhibits three different modes a mode with an increasing rate a mode with a uniform rate and a mode with a declining rate declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
