7175,rainfall induced shallow landslide is a common geological hazard around the world that can pose serious threat to both lives and property previous studies suggested that rainfall induced shallow landslides always occurred either above the bottom of a downward wetting front in infiltration or below a rising water table this paper proposed a different mechanism of shallow landslides in a modelling approach the comprehensive physics based integrated hydrology model inhm and the infinite slope stability model were employed on a virtual slope to simulate the hydrologic response and estimate the slope stability different failure mechanisms with various characteristics were investigated under diverse rainfall scenarios i e various combinations of rainfall depths durations and temporal patterns the results showed a novel mechanism of shallow landslides a significant vertical change in saturated hydrologic conductivity causes the accumulation of infiltrated water and subsequently leading to an increase pore pressures and landslides in unsaturated soil layer more importantly this kind of landslide would bring larger landslide volume even with smaller total rainfall

mountainous and hilly regions alexander 1989 asch et al 2007 beville et al 2010 ellen and wieczorek 1988 it is normally characterized by small thickness overlies impermeable rocks and long failure plane parallel to slope surface shallow landslides are mainly caused by intense or prolonged rainfall although human activities could also affect them e g cutting of the toe or excessive loading on the slope bordoni et al 2015 montrasio et al 2015 ran et al 2012b the rainfall induced landslides relies principally on the increased pore pressure in soil which reduced effective normal stress to a critical level campbell 1975 renwick 1982 moreover the greater soil bulk density resulting from the increasing soil moisture content also increases the sliding force it is generally accepted that there are two stages of hydraulic responses to rainfall for a homogeneous infinite shallow slope i e the infiltration stage and the groundwater rising stage the infiltration stage involves propagation of wetting front and the groundwater rising stage starts after rainwater infiltrates and reaches the deep soil bedrock interface li et al 2013 wang and sassa 2001 previous studies proposed that rainfall induced shallow landslide are initiated by either loss of matric suction above the bottom of a downward wetting front collins and znidarcic 2004 ng et al 2001 rahardjo et al 2007 or generation and increase of positive pore pressure below a rising water table cho and lee 2002 collins and znidarcic 2004 rahardjo et al 2007 under rainfall the infiltration stage and the groundwater rising stage are continuous in time when the initial groundwater table is above the interface of soil and bedrock in a slope however there may be a period of time at the interval between these two stages when the initial groundwater table is below the soil bedrock interface the groundwater table could not rise immediately after rainfall infiltrates through the soil bedrock interface the original groundwater table may rise slowly or always stay in bedrock layer because of the extremely low saturated hydrologic conductivity during this period of time the interface of the two layers with distinct saturated hydrologic conductivity provides a place for water accumulation in unsaturated condition a hypothesis can be proposed that shallow landslide may occur during this interval time period more attention should be paid to the mechanism and the failure characteristics of this type of shallow landslides rainfall characteristics can greatly impact features of shallow landslides in general shallow landslides occurring above the bottom of a downward wetting front are caused by high intensity storms with short duration whereas shallow landslides occurred below the rising groundwater table are normally caused by moderate intensity storms with long duration iverson 2000 wieczorek 1987 many studies considered rainfall thresholds for landslide activities e g bordoni et al 2015 kanjanakul et al 2016 wieczorek and guzzetti 2000 zêzere et al 2014 rainfall intensity duration cumulative event rainfall maximum hourly rainfall intensity and other factors are considered to associate with the occurrence of shallow landslides caine 2012 guidicini and iwasa 1977 guzzetti et al 2007 less attention however has been paid to the impacts of rainfall temporal patterns on shallow landslides tsai 2007 tsai and wang 2011 studied the influences of rainfall temporal patterns on shallow landslides in unsaturated soils due to dissipation of matric suction by using the physical based shallow landslide model in which the complete richards equation was applied and the results showed that not only the occurrence of landslides but also the failure time and depths were affected by the rainfall patterns these studies indicated that the shallow landslide characteristics i e failure time and depth were closely related to the rainfall characteristics there are different methods to assess the stability of slopes including the limit equilibrium method the limit analysis method and the finite element method johari and javadi 2012 the limit equilibrium method or infinite slope stability model selby 1993 has been widely used at the hillslope and catchment scales because of its simplicity and operability ebel et al 2010 shao et al 2015 it simplifies the complex landslide problems into a direct calculation of safety factor with a few parameters or variables the safety factor is defined as the ratio between the resisting force and driving force the factor greater than one indicates a stable state of slope while the value less than one represents instability of slope the soil bulk density used to calculate the sliding force are usually taken as a fixed value during the infiltration of precipitation however the non negligible effect of increased degree of saturation on the unit weight and the shear strength of unsaturated soil should be considered tsai and wang 2010 spatially distributed hydrological model is required to obtain the variables needed in the infinite slope stability model various process based hydrology models based on different equations and algorithms have been proposed to assess shallow landslide hazard e g burton and bathurst 1998 green and ampt 1911 iverson 2000 montgomery and dietrich 1994 salvucci and entekhabi 1994 the comprehensive physical based integrated hydrology model inhm vanderkwaak 1999 has been successfully employed to simulate soil water dynamic and soil pore pressure under rainfall in many investigations of shallow landslides e g beville et al 2010 ebel et al 2010 mirus et al 2007 ran et al 2015 in many studies soil bedrock interface was proposed as the failure plane in modelling shallow landslides for simplicity e g beville et al 2010 casadei et al 2003 deb and el kadi 2009 he et al 2016 lee and ho 2009 tiwari et al 2014 but this simplification sometimes does not match actual shallow landslides using inhm setting failure depth of landslide before modelling is not need because the position of failure plane can be simulated automatically by the model heppner et al 2006 the aims of this paper are to find whether the shallow landslides occur between the infiltration stage and the groundwater rising stage and to understand the rainfall induced shallow landslides mechanisms under different rainfall characteristics 2 methodology in order to investigate the mechanism rainfall induced shallow landslide this study proposed a numerical modelling method coupling a slope stability model and a hydrology model the hydrology model was used to simulate soil moisture content and pore pressure of a soil slope with landslide potential and the modelling results were then used to calculate safety factor of the slope with the slope stability model the combination of the two models can represent the location of failure plane and happening time of the potential shallow landslide while no advance assumption was needed for the failure plane position 2 1 infinite slope stability model and inhm model rainfall induced landslides are generally shallow and the failure planes are commonly parallel to the slope surface for this reason the slope stability is often evaluated using the infinite slope model selby 1993 the limit equilibrium approach is mostly effective for landslides with a small depth compared with their length wu et al 2016 and this method is capable of calculating the safety factor of any position with high accuracy rahardjo et al 2007 a landslide occurs as driving stress contributing to failure exceeds anti slip stress offered by soil mass strength namely sliding can occur when driving force is larger than the resisting force the expression for safety factor is given by 1 fs τ f τ resisting force τ f kg m s 2 is expressed by 2 τ f c σ u a tan φ u a u w tan φ b where c kg m s 2 is effective cohesion of soil σ kg m s 2 is normal stress u a kg m s 2 is pore air

normal stress on failure plane u a u w is matric suction the value of φ b approaches the effective angle of friction φ at low matric suction value fredlund et al 1987 therefore the assumption of φ b φ

moisture content during infiltration can be expressed in eq 8 and soil moisture content can be obtained from inhm the physics based integrated hydrology model inhm was originally developed by vanderkwaak loague and vanderkwaak 2002 vanderkwaak 1999 vanderkwaak and loague 2001 and the model can quantitatively simulate 3 dimensional variably saturated flow and solute transport in porous media and 2d flow over the ground surface or in open channels the applications of inhm for several catchments revealed its modelling results were reasonably well the distributed hydrologic responses to rainfall in soil can be simulated by inhm which were required in the calculation of safety factor of a soil slope the flexibility of inhm has facilitated successful simulation of hydrologic response for various hydrology environment ran et al 2007 ran et al 2012a ran et al 2013 thus it was employed to simulate detailed soil water content and pressure head field which were used to drive the infinite slope stability model inhm employs the control volume infinite element method to solve the governing equations subsurface flow in porous media is simulated in inhm by using 9 f a q q b q

a slope with large length to depth ratio was design to model potential shallow landslide the dimensions of the slope mesh were 10 m long 1 m wide and 2 m deep δ x and δ y of the nodal spacing were 0 1 m and 0 2 m respectively and the vertical nodal spacing δ z was 0 1 m fig 1 the total numbers of the nodes and the elements in the mesh were 11 200 and 20 000 this meshing size was chosen based on the previous studies in slope failure simulations heppner et al 2006 ran et al 2007 the meshing size was fine enough to simulate variably saturated flow in soil and location of potential failure plane under rainfall finer meshing may cause more unnecessary computational time the slope gradient was fixed at 35 according to previous studies on the slope of similar soil properties rahardjo et al 2007 ran et al 2012b the shallow landslide will not occur if the slope gradient is less than the internal friction angle while it will be excessively easy to lose stability if the slope is too steep in order to avoid influences of boundary conditions the observation points were set at the center of the slope with uniform distribution along depth as the x y coordinates were 0 5 m 5 m the coordinates of the slope was defined in fig 1 2 2 2 boundary conditions and initial conditions the boundary conditions for each face of the soil layer were set as follows impermeable faces a b e f a c g e b d h f e g h f and c d h g and permeable face a c d b there was an impermeable bedrock layer below the 2 m soil layer the saturated hydrologic conductivity of this bedrock layer was set to zero to represent an extreme low permeability of bedrock moisture variation in bedrock was not the point of this study the initial water table was located at the depth of 3 m below and paralleling the slope surface so the pore pressure head of the soil layer ranged from 1 m to 3 m from the soil bedrock interface to the slope surface there was initially no ponding on the slope surface 2 2 3 parameters it was assumed in this study that the soil of the slope were homogeneous and its hydraulic properties were isotropic the parameters of soil properties for simulations are listed in table 1 and they were based on the studies of the shallow landslides in coos bay oregon ebel et al 2010 ran et al 2012b torres et al 1998 2 2 4 rainfall scenarios to simulate different types of rainfall induced shallow landslides a series of rainfall scenarios were designed with varying total depths durations and temporal patterns there were seven total rainfall depths i e 50 mm 85 mm 100 mm 150 mm 200 mm 300 mm and 400 mm and three rainfall durations i e 5 h 10 h and 20 h various combinations of rainfall depths and durations covered short term heavy rainfalls and long term moderate rainfalls four rainfall temporal patterns including uniform advanced intermediated and delayed patterns were involved for each combination of rainfall depth and duration for example see fig 2 for the four patterns of the 50 mm 10 h rainfalls totally there were 84 rainfall scenarios i e 7 rainfall depths 3 rainfall durations 4 rainfall patterns see table 2 in this study 2 2 5 modelling runs before all rainfall scenario runs a 10 min preparation run of inhm without rainfall was conducted to make the soil moisture condition stable in the soil layer and then each scenario run started from this prepared condition so no warming up stage for each run was needed for each rainfall scenario the inhm model was run to simulate soil moisture content and pore pressure of the soil layer and the infinite slope stability model was employed for computation of soil layer safety factor in every thirty minutes the safety factor was calculated from the slope surface to the bottom of the soil layer and the location at which safety factor was less than one was taken to be the failure position the models started simulation as rainfall began and kept running during rainfall time no matter landslide happened or not in each scenario run and if no landslide happened during rainfall the simulation time was extended until occurrence of landslide or by 3 days if no landslide in the whole process 3 results using the infinite slope stability model and the inhm model the scenario simulation results gave the variation of safety factor and pore pressure with depth in soil layer for each rainfall event the failure depth and timing were presented for each shallow landslide and the differences of the failure depths and timings under different rainfall events were compared given the location of the failure plane in each shallow landslide variation of safety factor with time at the failure plane was particularly shown 3 1 safety factor and pore pressure with soil depth after rainwater infiltrated into the soil layer safety factor above the wetting front of infiltration was much less than that before rainfall below the wetting front safety factor then decreased with depth see figs 3 and 5 for the 400 mm 10 h and 100 mm 10 h rainfall events as examples as infiltration continued the minimum value of safety factor above the wetting front was becoming smaller and it decreased fastest under the advanced rainfall among the four rainfall patterns the safety factor less than one may occur above the downward wetting front within the soil profile fig 3 or at the bottom of the soil layer fig 5 pore pressure near the surface rose immediately when the rainwater infiltrated into the soil and that below the wetting front in soil stayed constant see figs 4 and 6 for the 400 mm 10 h and 100 mm 10 h rainfall events pore pressure increased most rapidly in soil depth with the propagation of wetting front under the advanced rainfall followed by the uniform intermediated and the delayed patterns in order it should be noted that the model continuously simulated and calculated water movement and safety factor and did not stop until the end of a modelling period even though in a few scenarios safety factor less than one and large positive pore pressure can be found in the results thus it can be found that for some safety factor lines in fig 3 a large part of a line e g the line of t 10 h is less than one 3 2 failure time and depth of landslides under different rainfall characteristics with different total depths durations and temporal patterns of rainfall failure time and depths of shallow landslides varied in different rainfall scenarios shown in table 2 under an identical total depth of rainfall long rainfall duration had later failure time e g the time to occurrence of landslide for the 300 mm 5 h 300 mm 10 h and 300 mm 20 h uniform rainfall events were 2 5 h 5 h and 10 5 h respectively on the other hand large rainfall depth made early landslide if rainfall duration was same e g the time to landslides for the 85 mm 10 h 100 mm 10 h 150 mm 10 h 200 mm 10 h 300 mm 10 h and 400 mm 10 h uniform rainfall events were 68 h 44 h 10 5 h 8 h 5 h and 4 h respectively moreover when the rainfall depths were 85 mm and 100 mm the shallow landslides occurred 1 3 days after the rainfalls stopped the shallow landslides caused by the advanced rainfall happened first among the four patterns under same rainfall depth and duration the failure time had greater difference among the four patterns with longer duration when rainfall depths were the same for instance the maximum difference of failure time among four patterns were 2 h 4 h and 8 5 h for 300 mm 5 h 300 mm 10 h and 300 mm 20 h rainfall events respectively the failure depths under different rainfall events had great differences when the rainfall depths were 85 mm and 100 mm all the failure planes occurred at the bottom of the soil layer i e 2 m from the land surface no matter what the rainfall durations and patterns were when the rainfall depths were 150 mm 200 mm 300 mm and 400 mm the shallow landslides happened above the soil bedrock interface and the failure depth of landslide was slightly deeper with long rainfall duration than short duration there was no big difference of failure depth among the four patterns when the rainfall depth and duration were fixed in addition no shallow landslide happened when total rainfall depth was 50 mm 3 3 variation of safety factor with time shallow landslides occurred at the bottom of soil when the rainfall depths were 85 mm and 100 mm the safety factor decreased with time but was not less than one during rainfall time while the changing processes of safety factor with time were different among the four rainfall patterns see fig 7 for two observation points under the 100 mm rainfall events the shallow landslides occurred above the soil bedrock interface at different time when the rainfall depths were 150 mm 200 mm 300 mm and 400 mm the variations of safety factor with time at the failure planes were different among the four rainfall patterns see fig 8 the coordinates of the points were listed in the plots 4 discussion 4 1 rationality of the models the integrated hydrology model used in this study was a physics based hydrologic model it was based upon numerical solution to the coupled partial differential equations that describe water movement on the surface and within the variably saturated subsurface vanderkwaak 1999 this physics based hydrological model employs fundamental physics laws to describe natural processes and the simulation results have clear physical meanings inhm has been successfully employed for many event based rainfall runoff simulations catchment scales e g ebel et al 2008 loague and vanderkwaak 2002 mirus et al 2007 the model performance including the surface or subsurface simulations was reasonably well by a number of validations the distributed hydrology response results of inhm and their combination with the infinite slope stability model was reliable effective and accurate in modelling the actual shallow landslides i e the shallow landslides in coos bay the lerida court site and the c3 catchment etc beville et al 2010 ebel et al 2010 ebel et al 2007 mirus et al 2007 ran et al 2012b the numerical modelling in this paper was a theoretical study concerning shallow landslide mechanisms although it lacks the physical experiment or prototype measurement as a validation the models used were physically based and validated in previous landslide modellings the simulation results clearly put forward the instability condition and process in landslide and they can assist to offer accurate references for indoor experiments or outdoor monitoring 4 2 mechanisms of shallow landslides the rainfall induced shallow landslides in this study were generally sorted by two types of mechanism as below 1 shallow landslides occurred above the bottom of the downward wetting front of infiltration figs 3 and 4 the depth of failure plane depended on rainfall characteristics and varied under different rainfall events 2 shallow landslides occurred at the soil bedrock interface where saturated hydrologic conductivity had a significant vertical decrease this type of shallow landslides happened after the wetting front reached the bottom of the soil layer see fig 6 but groundwater table did not increase at the failure time i e the pore pressures were still negative in all rainfall scenarios the shallow landslides caused by the 150 mm 200 mm 300 mm and 400 mm rainfall events were subject to the first type mechanism while the rainfall scenarios with 85 mm and 100 mm total depths induced the shallow landslides of the second type mechanism see table 2 4 2 1 a novel mechanism of shallow landslides in previous studies two types of rainfall induced shallow landslides mechanisms can be summarized as below 1 landslides triggered by a loss in matric suction during the propagation of wetting front in infiltration process 2 landslides induced by generation of positive pore pressures during the groundwater rising stage the first type of landslides in this paper i e under the 150 mm 200 m 300 mm and 400 mm rainfall depths were subject to mechanism one however the second type of the landslides under the 85 mm and 100 mm rainfall depths occurred neither above the bottom of downward wetting front nor below the rising groundwater table see fig 6 thus the mechanism of these shallow landslides is novel rainfall events with 85 mm and 100 mm rainfall depths did not lead to shallow landslides during the infiltration stage before the wetting front reached the bottom of the soil layer see fig 5 for the rainfall of 100 m 10 h the total infiltration was not enough to form a failure plane above the bottom of downward wetting front even though all rainwater infiltrated into the soil layer in a short time after the wetting front reached the soil layer bottom a significant vertical decrease of saturated hydrologic conductivity caused accumulation of infiltrated water at the soil layer bottom and the infiltrated water retained here and moved downstream on the soil bedrock interface accumulated water subsequently led to pore pressure increase see fig 9 near the bottom of the soil layer shallow landslides occurred in this unsaturated soil layer when the increased sliding force i e the largest downslope component of the gravitational stress along depth overcame the decreased resisting force there was no change of water table before the occurrence of the landslide this novel mechanism indicated that shallow landslides can occur after the infiltration stage and before the water table rising stage under rainfalls thus this made a completion in the changing process of rainfall induced shallow landslide mechanism from rainwater infiltration to water table rise practically the shallow landslides caused by this new mechanism can be more dangerous because this type of shallow landslides can bring larger landslide volume even with smaller total rainfall depth 4 2 2 main triggering factor of shallow landslides in this study the resisting force eq 3 to slide in the soil layer decreased largely due to the increase soil pore pressure before all shallow landslides but the driving force eq 6 to slide increased because of the increased soil moisture content and soil weight a quantitative comparison of resisting force and driving force was made for the 100 mm 5 h and 200 mm 10 h uniform rainfalls as instance fig 10 in which the decrease of the resisting force was much larger than the increase of the driving force this indicated that the main factor triggering the slope failures was still pore pressure increase this may be because the soil had a moderate porosity and the change of soil moisture content was small as the initial soil moisture content was high around 0 8 however the driving force can greatly impact shallow landslide when large change of soil moisture content occurred in a soil layer with high porosity 4 3 impacts of rainfall depths on shallow landslides 4 3 1 rainfall depths and failure type the key rainfall characteristic determining the type of the shallow landslides was the depth of the rainfalls in this study the first type of mechanism happened when the rainfall depth was 150 mm 200 mm 300 mm and 400 mm and the failure locations were above the interface of the soil and rock layers the second type of mechanism occurred when the rainfall depth was 85 mm and 100 mm and the slope failures of this mechanism occurred at the interface of the soil and rock layers i e 2 m depth from the land surface regardless of rainfall durations and patterns rainfall events with same intensity can lead to different types of shallow landslides due to the difference in total rainfall depth for example the 200 mm 10 h uniform and 400 mm 20 h uniform rainfall events triggered the first type of landslides with the same failure time and depths but the 100 mm 5 h uniform rainfall triggered the second type of landslide with completely different instability characteristics although they had the same intensity i e 20 mm h the first two rainfall events caused shallow landslides during the propagation of wetting front with the identical infiltration processes before landslides and the latter rainfall event caused the shallow landslide by accumulating water at the bottom of the soil layer while it did not provide enough infiltrated rainwater as the first two although it was found that the type of shallow landslide was related to the total rainfall depths the quantitative relationship between rainfall characteristics and failure depth is still complex systematic simulation and detailed quantitative analysis will be needed in the future study 4 3 2 accumulative infiltration before shallow landslides for all the first type landslides in this study the accumulative infiltration depths were around 150 mm before the failure time points for instance the shallow landslides happened just at the half of rainfall with uniform and intermediated patterns when total rainfall depth was 300 mm see table 2 and fig 8g i and the shallow landslides all happened around the end of rainfall for all the 150 mm rainfall events more studies are needed to explain this threshold of accumulative infiltration depth and the factors related to this threshold and a formula may be established between the accumulative infiltration threshold and the factors in the future study 4 4 impacts of rainfall patterns on shallow landslides 4 4 1 impacts of rainfall patterns on failure time the variation of safety factor with time during the rainfall showed great differences among the four different rainfall patterns see figs 7 and 8 and the failure time had a regular order the shallow landslides caused by the advanced rainfall always happened first among the four patterns when the rainfall depth and duration were same for the landslides occurring above infiltration wetting front the decrease of safety factor with soil depth was the earliest and fastest under the advanced rainfall while it was the latest and slowest under the delayed rainfall fig 8 among all the four rainfall patterns the average rainfall intensity of the advanced pattern was the largest for a period after rainfall started and the large amount of precipitation infiltrated into the soil layer increased pore pressure and caused shallow landslide the earliest among the four rainfall patterns a comparison between the intermediated and uniform pattern revealed that the decreasing rate of safety factor was larger for the uniform pattern than the intermediated pattern during the first half of the rainfall this is because the accumulated rainfall depth in the first half of the rainfall under the intermediated pattern was less than the uniform pattern the relationship was opposite for the latter half of rainfall according to this and the 150 mm failure threshold the intermediated rainfall caused landslides earlier than the uniform rainfall when the rainfall depth were 150 mm and 200 mm and the sequence was reversed when rainfall depth was 400 mm for the shallow landslides triggered by the accumulative infiltrated water on the soil bedrock interface the decreasing rate of safety factor for the advanced pattern was also the largest among the four patterns fig 7 the shallow landslide under the advanced rainfall pattern occurred earliest among all the rainfall patterns these findings provide reference information for disaster prevention and loss mitigation predicting rainfall pattern based on forecasted total rainfall depth and real time rainfall intensity can help estimate occurrence of shallow landslides and time window for evacuation 4 4 2 impacts of rainfall patterns on failure depths rainfall patterns had limited effect on failure depths in these simulations for the soil above the failure planes reached similar high moisture content when landslides occurred it was only found that the failure plane caused by the delayed pattern rainfall was slightly shallower than the other three patterns under the delayed pattern low rainfall intensity at the beginning of rainfall caused a slow increase of soil moisture content the soil above the failure plane can have higher soil moisture content than the other three patterns before high intensity rainfall came later therefore the failure depth under the delayed pattern rainfall was shallower than other rainfall patterns 5 conclusion rainfall induced shallow landslides mechanisms were studied in a modelling approach in this study the hydrologic response simulations and slope stability estimates were conducted with the integrated hydrology model inhm and the infinite slope stability model the landslides characteristics e g the failure time and depths under every rainfall event were calculated and compared changes of pore pressure and safety factor during the rainfall were also evaluated and analyzed when the initial groundwater table was below the soil bedrock interface it showed that two types of shallow landslides occurred under different rainfall characteristics one type was caused by direct suction loss during the infiltration stage however another type occurred neither behind the downward wetting front nor below the rising groundwater table the triggering mechanism of this type was a novel one a significant vertical change in saturated hydrologic conductivity causes the accumulation of infiltrated water and subsequently leading to an increase pore pressures and landslide in unsaturated soil layer the novel mechanism of shallow landslide occurred after the wetting front infiltration stage and before the groundwater rising stage making the corresponding relationship between the infiltrated water movement stages and the failure mechanisms more complete more importantly this type of shallow landslides could cause larger landslide volume even with smaller total rainfall depths in addition the failure types and characteristics were largely influenced by the rainfall characteristics 1 the failure types were related to the rainfall depths as the novel mechanism of shallow landslide happened when the total rainfall depths were smaller 2 the rainfall patterns had great impacts on the failure time as the advanced rainfall always triggered the landslides earliest under each mechanism this work expands our understanding about shallow landslides and could have important application in alleviating the loss of lives and property in addition the method has a potential to be a toolbox for shallow landslides prediction acknowledgments this research was financially supported by national natural

mountainous and hilly regions alexander 1989 asch et al 2007 beville et al 2010 ellen and wieczorek 1988 it is normally characterized by small thickness overlies impermeable rocks and long failure plane parallel to slope surface shallow landslides are mainly caused by intense or prolonged rainfall although human activities could also affect them e g cutting of the toe or excessive loading on the slope bordoni et al 2015 montrasio et al 2015 ran et al 2012b the rainfall induced landslides relies principally on the increased pore pressure in soil which reduced effective normal stress to a critical level campbell 1975 renwick 1982 moreover the greater soil bulk density resulting from the increasing soil moisture content also increases the sliding force it is generally accepted that there are two stages of hydraulic responses to rainfall for a homogeneous infinite shallow slope i e the infiltration stage and the groundwater rising stage the infiltration stage involves propagation of wetting front and the groundwater rising stage starts after rainwater infiltrates and reaches the deep soil bedrock interface li et al 2013 wang and sassa 2001 previous studies proposed that rainfall induced shallow landslide are initiated by either loss of matric suction above the bottom of a downward wetting front collins and znidarcic 2004 ng et al 2001 rahardjo et al 2007 or generation and increase of positive pore pressure below a rising water table cho and lee 2002 collins and znidarcic 2004 rahardjo et al 2007 under rainfall the infiltration stage and the groundwater rising stage are continuous in time when the initial groundwater table is above the interface of soil and bedrock in a slope however there may be a period of time at the interval between these two stages when the initial groundwater table is below the soil bedrock interface the groundwater table could not rise immediately after rainfall infiltrates through the soil bedrock interface the original groundwater table may rise slowly or always stay in bedrock layer because of the extremely low saturated hydrologic conductivity during this period of time the interface of the two layers with distinct saturated hydrologic conductivity provides a place for water accumulation in unsaturated condition a hypothesis can be proposed that shallow landslide may occur during this interval time period more attention should be paid to the mechanism and the failure characteristics of this type of shallow landslides rainfall characteristics can greatly impact features of shallow landslides in general shallow landslides occurring above the bottom of a downward wetting front are caused by high intensity storms with short duration whereas shallow landslides occurred below the rising groundwater table are normally caused by moderate intensity storms with long duration iverson 2000 wieczorek 1987 many studies considered rainfall thresholds for landslide activities e g bordoni et al 2015 kanjanakul et al 2016 wieczorek and guzzetti 2000 zêzere et al 2014 rainfall intensity duration cumulative event rainfall maximum hourly rainfall intensity and other factors are considered to associate with the occurrence of shallow landslides caine 2012 guidicini and iwasa 1977 guzzetti et al 2007 less attention however has been paid to the impacts of rainfall temporal patterns on shallow landslides tsai 2007 tsai and wang 2011 studied the influences of rainfall temporal patterns on shallow landslides in unsaturated soils due to dissipation of matric suction by using the physical based shallow landslide model in which the complete richards equation was applied and the results showed that not only the occurrence of landslides but also the failure time and depths were affected by the rainfall patterns these studies indicated that the shallow landslide characteristics i e failure time and depth were closely related to the rainfall characteristics there are different methods to assess the stability of slopes including the limit equilibrium method the limit analysis method and the finite element method johari and javadi 2012 the limit equilibrium method or infinite slope stability model selby 1993 has been widely used at the hillslope and catchment scales because of its simplicity and operability ebel et al 2010 shao et al 2015 it simplifies the complex landslide problems into a direct calculation of safety factor with a few parameters or variables the safety factor is defined as the ratio between the resisting force and driving force the factor greater than one indicates a stable state of slope while the value less than one represents instability of slope the soil bulk density used to calculate the sliding force are usually taken as a fixed value during the infiltration of precipitation however the non negligible effect of increased degree of saturation on the unit weight and the shear strength of unsaturated soil should be considered tsai and wang 2010 spatially distributed hydrological model is required to obtain the variables needed in the infinite slope stability model various process based hydrology models based on different equations and algorithms have been proposed to assess shallow landslide hazard e g burton and bathurst 1998 green and ampt 1911 iverson 2000 montgomery and dietrich 1994 salvucci and entekhabi 1994 the comprehensive physical based integrated hydrology model inhm vanderkwaak 1999 has been successfully employed to simulate soil water dynamic and soil pore pressure under rainfall in many investigations of shallow landslides e g beville et al 2010 ebel et al 2010 mirus et al 2007 ran et al 2015 in many studies soil bedrock interface was proposed as the failure plane in modelling shallow landslides for simplicity e g beville et al 2010 casadei et al 2003 deb and el kadi 2009 he et al 2016 lee and ho 2009 tiwari et al 2014 but this simplification sometimes does not match actual shallow landslides using inhm setting failure depth of landslide before modelling is not need because the position of failure plane can be simulated automatically by the model heppner et al 2006 the aims of this paper are to find whether the shallow landslides occur between the infiltration stage and the groundwater rising stage and to understand the rainfall induced shallow landslides mechanisms under different rainfall characteristics 2 methodology in order to investigate the mechanism rainfall induced shallow landslide this study proposed a numerical modelling method coupling a slope stability model and a hydrology model the hydrology model was used to simulate soil moisture content and pore pressure of a soil slope with landslide potential and the modelling results were then used to calculate safety factor of the slope with the slope stability model the combination of the two models can represent the location of failure plane and happening time of the potential shallow landslide while no advance assumption was needed for the failure plane position 2 1 infinite slope stability model and inhm model rainfall induced landslides are generally shallow and the failure planes are commonly parallel to the slope surface for this reason the slope stability is often evaluated using the infinite slope model selby 1993 the limit equilibrium approach is mostly effective for landslides with a small depth compared with their length wu et al 2016 and this method is capable of calculating the safety factor of any position with high accuracy rahardjo et al 2007 a landslide occurs as driving stress contributing to failure exceeds anti slip stress offered by soil mass strength namely sliding can occur when driving force is larger than the resisting force the expression for safety factor is given by 1 fs τ f τ resisting force τ f kg m s 2 is expressed by 2 τ f c σ u a tan φ u a u w tan φ b where c kg m s 2 is effective cohesion of soil σ kg m s 2 is normal stress u a kg m s 2 is pore air

moisture content during infiltration can be expressed in eq 8 and soil moisture content can be obtained from inhm the physics based integrated hydrology model inhm was originally developed by vanderkwaak loague and vanderkwaak 2002 vanderkwaak 1999 vanderkwaak and loague 2001 and the model can quantitatively simulate 3 dimensional variably saturated flow and solute transport in porous media and 2d flow over the ground surface or in open channels the applications of inhm for several catchments revealed its modelling results were reasonably well the distributed hydrologic responses to rainfall in soil can be simulated by inhm which were required in the calculation of safety factor of a soil slope the flexibility of inhm has facilitated successful simulation of hydrologic response for various hydrology environment ran et al 2007 ran et al 2012a ran et al 2013 thus it was employed to simulate detailed soil water content and pressure head field which were used to drive the infinite slope stability model inhm employs the control volume infinite element method to solve the governing equations subsurface flow in porous media is simulated in inhm by using 9 f a q q b q

a slope with large length to depth ratio was design to model potential shallow landslide the dimensions of the slope mesh were 10 m long 1 m wide and 2 m deep δ x and δ y of the nodal spacing were 0 1 m and 0 2 m respectively and the vertical nodal spacing δ z was 0 1 m fig 1 the total numbers of the nodes and the elements in the mesh were 11 200 and 20 000 this meshing size was chosen based on the previous studies in slope failure simulations heppner et al 2006 ran et al 2007 the meshing size was fine enough to simulate variably saturated flow in soil and location of potential failure plane under rainfall finer meshing may cause more unnecessary computational time the slope gradient was fixed at 35 according to previous studies on the slope of similar soil properties rahardjo et al 2007 ran et al 2012b the shallow landslide will not occur if the slope gradient is less than the internal friction angle while it will be excessively easy to lose stability if the slope is too steep in order to avoid influences of boundary conditions the observation points were set at the center of the slope with uniform distribution along depth as the x y coordinates were 0 5 m 5 m the coordinates of the slope was defined in fig 1 2 2 2 boundary conditions and initial conditions the boundary conditions for each face of the soil layer were set as follows impermeable faces a b e f a c g e b d h f e g h f and c d h g and permeable face a c d b there was an impermeable bedrock layer below the 2 m soil layer the saturated hydrologic conductivity of this bedrock layer was set to zero to represent an extreme low permeability of bedrock moisture variation in bedrock was not the point of this study the initial water table was located at the depth of 3 m below and paralleling the slope surface so the pore pressure head of the soil layer ranged from 1 m to 3 m from the soil bedrock interface to the slope surface there was initially no ponding on the slope surface 2 2 3 parameters it was assumed in this study that the soil of the slope were homogeneous and its hydraulic properties were isotropic the parameters of soil properties for simulations are listed in table 1 and they were based on the studies of the shallow landslides in coos bay oregon ebel et al 2010 ran et al 2012b torres et al 1998 2 2 4 rainfall scenarios to simulate different types of rainfall induced shallow landslides a series of rainfall scenarios were designed with varying total depths durations and temporal patterns there were seven total rainfall depths i e 50 mm 85 mm 100 mm 150 mm 200 mm 300 mm and 400 mm and three rainfall durations i e 5 h 10 h and 20 h various combinations of rainfall depths and durations covered short term heavy rainfalls and long term moderate rainfalls four rainfall temporal patterns including uniform advanced intermediated and delayed patterns were involved for each combination of rainfall depth and duration for example see fig 2 for the four patterns of the 50 mm 10 h rainfalls totally there were 84 rainfall scenarios i e 7 rainfall depths 3 rainfall durations 4 rainfall patterns see table 2 in this study 2 2 5 modelling runs before all rainfall scenario runs a 10 min preparation run of inhm without rainfall was conducted to make the soil moisture condition stable in the soil layer and then each scenario run started from this prepared condition so no warming up stage for each run was needed for each rainfall scenario the inhm model was run to simulate soil moisture content and pore pressure of the soil layer and the infinite slope stability model was employed for computation of soil layer safety factor in every thirty minutes the safety factor was calculated from the slope surface to the bottom of the soil layer and the location at which safety factor was less than one was taken to be the failure position the models started simulation as rainfall began and kept running during rainfall time no matter landslide happened or not in each scenario run and if no landslide happened during rainfall the simulation time was extended until occurrence of landslide or by 3 days if no landslide in the whole process 3 results using the infinite slope stability model and the inhm model the scenario simulation results gave the variation of safety factor and pore pressure with depth in soil layer for each rainfall event the failure depth and timing were presented for each shallow landslide and the differences of the failure depths and timings under different rainfall events were compared given the location of the failure plane in each shallow landslide variation of safety factor with time at the failure plane was particularly shown 3 1 safety factor and pore pressure with soil depth after rainwater infiltrated into the soil layer safety factor above the wetting front of infiltration was much less than that before rainfall below the wetting front safety factor then decreased with depth see figs 3 and 5 for the 400 mm 10 h and 100 mm 10 h rainfall events as examples as infiltration continued the minimum value of safety factor above the wetting front was becoming smaller and it decreased fastest under the advanced rainfall among the four rainfall patterns the safety factor less than one may occur above the downward wetting front within the soil profile fig 3 or at the bottom of the soil layer fig 5 pore pressure near the surface rose immediately when the rainwater infiltrated into the soil and that below the wetting front in soil stayed constant see figs 4 and 6 for the 400 mm 10 h and 100 mm 10 h rainfall events pore pressure increased most rapidly in soil depth with the propagation of wetting front under the advanced rainfall followed by the uniform intermediated and the delayed patterns in order it should be noted that the model continuously simulated and calculated water movement and safety factor and did not stop until the end of a modelling period even though in a few scenarios safety factor less than one and large positive pore pressure can be found in the results thus it can be found that for some safety factor lines in fig 3 a large part of a line e g the line of t 10 h is less than one 3 2 failure time and depth of landslides under different rainfall characteristics with different total depths durations and temporal patterns of rainfall failure time and depths of shallow landslides varied in different rainfall scenarios shown in table 2 under an identical total depth of rainfall long rainfall duration had later failure time e g the time to occurrence of landslide for the 300 mm 5 h 300 mm 10 h and 300 mm 20 h uniform rainfall events were 2 5 h 5 h and 10 5 h respectively on the other hand large rainfall depth made early landslide if rainfall duration was same e g the time to landslides for the 85 mm 10 h 100 mm 10 h 150 mm 10 h 200 mm 10 h 300 mm 10 h and 400 mm 10 h uniform rainfall events were 68 h 44 h 10 5 h 8 h 5 h and 4 h respectively moreover when the rainfall depths were 85 mm and 100 mm the shallow landslides occurred 1 3 days after the rainfalls stopped the shallow landslides caused by the advanced rainfall happened first among the four patterns under same rainfall depth and duration the failure time had greater difference among the four patterns with longer duration when rainfall depths were the same for instance the maximum difference of failure time among four patterns were 2 h 4 h and 8 5 h for 300 mm 5 h 300 mm 10 h and 300 mm 20 h rainfall events respectively the failure depths under different rainfall events had great differences when the rainfall depths were 85 mm and 100 mm all the failure planes occurred at the bottom of the soil layer i e 2 m from the land surface no matter what the rainfall durations and patterns were when the rainfall depths were 150 mm 200 mm 300 mm and 400 mm the shallow landslides happened above the soil bedrock interface and the failure depth of landslide was slightly deeper with long rainfall duration than short duration there was no big difference of failure depth among the four patterns when the rainfall depth and duration were fixed in addition no shallow landslide happened when total rainfall depth was 50 mm 3 3 variation of safety factor with time shallow landslides occurred at the bottom of soil when the rainfall depths were 85 mm and 100 mm the safety factor decreased with time but was not less than one during rainfall time while the changing processes of safety factor with time were different among the four rainfall patterns see fig 7 for two observation points under the 100 mm rainfall events the shallow landslides occurred above the soil bedrock interface at different time when the rainfall depths were 150 mm 200 mm 300 mm and 400 mm the variations of safety factor with time at the failure planes were different among the four rainfall patterns see fig 8 the coordinates of the points were listed in the plots 4 discussion 4 1 rationality of the models the integrated hydrology model used in this study was a physics based hydrologic model it was based upon numerical solution to the coupled partial differential equations that describe water movement on the surface and within the variably saturated subsurface vanderkwaak 1999 this physics based hydrological model employs fundamental physics laws to describe natural processes and the simulation results have clear physical meanings inhm has been successfully employed for many event based rainfall runoff simulations catchment scales e g ebel et al 2008 loague and vanderkwaak 2002 mirus et al 2007 the model performance including the surface or subsurface simulations was reasonably well by a number of validations the distributed hydrology response results of inhm and their combination with the infinite slope stability model was reliable effective and accurate in modelling the actual shallow landslides i e the shallow landslides in coos bay the lerida court site and the c3 catchment etc beville et al 2010 ebel et al 2010 ebel et al 2007 mirus et al 2007 ran et al 2012b the numerical modelling in this paper was a theoretical study concerning shallow landslide mechanisms although it lacks the physical experiment or prototype measurement as a validation the models used were physically based and validated in previous landslide modellings the simulation results clearly put forward the instability condition and process in landslide and they can assist to offer accurate references for indoor experiments or outdoor monitoring 4 2 mechanisms of shallow landslides the rainfall induced shallow landslides in this study were generally sorted by two types of mechanism as below 1 shallow landslides occurred above the bottom of the downward wetting front of infiltration figs 3 and 4 the depth of failure plane depended on rainfall characteristics and varied under different rainfall events 2 shallow landslides occurred at the soil bedrock interface where saturated hydrologic conductivity had a significant vertical decrease this type of shallow landslides happened after the wetting front reached the bottom of the soil layer see fig 6 but groundwater table did not increase at the failure time i e the pore pressures were still negative in all rainfall scenarios the shallow landslides caused by the 150 mm 200 mm 300 mm and 400 mm rainfall events were subject to the first type mechanism while the rainfall scenarios with 85 mm and 100 mm total depths induced the shallow landslides of the second type mechanism see table 2 4 2 1 a novel mechanism of shallow landslides in previous studies two types of rainfall induced shallow landslides mechanisms can be summarized as below 1 landslides triggered by a loss in matric suction during the propagation of wetting front in infiltration process 2 landslides induced by generation of positive pore pressures during the groundwater rising stage the first type of landslides in this paper i e under the 150 mm 200 m 300 mm and 400 mm rainfall depths were subject to mechanism one however the second type of the landslides under the 85 mm and 100 mm rainfall depths occurred neither above the bottom of downward wetting front nor below the rising groundwater table see fig 6 thus the mechanism of these shallow landslides is novel rainfall events with 85 mm and 100 mm rainfall depths did not lead to shallow landslides during the infiltration stage before the wetting front reached the bottom of the soil layer see fig 5 for the rainfall of 100 m 10 h the total infiltration was not enough to form a failure plane above the bottom of downward wetting front even though all rainwater infiltrated into the soil layer in a short time after the wetting front reached the soil layer bottom a significant vertical decrease of saturated hydrologic conductivity caused accumulation of infiltrated water at the soil layer bottom and the infiltrated water retained here and moved downstream on the soil bedrock interface accumulated water subsequently led to pore pressure increase see fig 9 near the bottom of the soil layer shallow landslides occurred in this unsaturated soil layer when the increased sliding force i e the largest downslope component of the gravitational stress along depth overcame the decreased resisting force there was no change of water table before the occurrence of the landslide this novel mechanism indicated that shallow landslides can occur after the infiltration stage and before the water table rising stage under rainfalls thus this made a completion in the changing process of rainfall induced shallow landslide mechanism from rainwater infiltration to water table rise practically the shallow landslides caused by this new mechanism can be more dangerous because this type of shallow landslides can bring larger landslide volume even with smaller total rainfall depth 4 2 2 main triggering factor of shallow landslides in this study the resisting force eq 3 to slide in the soil layer decreased largely due to the increase soil pore pressure before all shallow landslides but the driving force eq 6 to slide increased because of the increased soil moisture content and soil weight a quantitative comparison of resisting force and driving force was made for the 100 mm 5 h and 200 mm 10 h uniform rainfalls as instance fig 10 in which the decrease of the resisting force was much larger than the increase of the driving force this indicated that the main factor triggering the slope failures was still pore pressure increase this may be because the soil had a moderate porosity and the change of soil moisture content was small as the initial soil moisture content was high around 0 8 however the driving force can greatly impact shallow landslide when large change of soil moisture content occurred in a soil layer with high porosity 4 3 impacts of rainfall depths on shallow landslides 4 3 1 rainfall depths and failure type the key rainfall characteristic determining the type of the shallow landslides was the depth of the rainfalls in this study the first type of mechanism happened when the rainfall depth was 150 mm 200 mm 300 mm and 400 mm and the failure locations were above the interface of the soil and rock layers the second type of mechanism occurred when the rainfall depth was 85 mm and 100 mm and the slope failures of this mechanism occurred at the interface of the soil and rock layers i e 2 m depth from the land surface regardless of rainfall durations and patterns rainfall events with same intensity can lead to different types of shallow landslides due to the difference in total rainfall depth for example the 200 mm 10 h uniform and 400 mm 20 h uniform rainfall events triggered the first type of landslides with the same failure time and depths but the 100 mm 5 h uniform rainfall triggered the second type of landslide with completely different instability characteristics although they had the same intensity i e 20 mm h the first two rainfall events caused shallow landslides during the propagation of wetting front with the identical infiltration processes before landslides and the latter rainfall event caused the shallow landslide by accumulating water at the bottom of the soil layer while it did not provide enough infiltrated rainwater as the first two although it was found that the type of shallow landslide was related to the total rainfall depths the quantitative relationship between rainfall characteristics and failure depth is still complex systematic simulation and detailed quantitative analysis will be needed in the future study 4 3 2 accumulative infiltration before shallow landslides for all the first type landslides in this study the accumulative infiltration depths were around 150 mm before the failure time points for instance the shallow landslides happened just at the half of rainfall with uniform and intermediated patterns when total rainfall depth was 300 mm see table 2 and fig 8g i and the shallow landslides all happened around the end of rainfall for all the 150 mm rainfall events more studies are needed to explain this threshold of accumulative infiltration depth and the factors related to this threshold and a formula may be established between the accumulative infiltration threshold and the factors in the future study 4 4 impacts of rainfall patterns on shallow landslides 4 4 1 impacts of rainfall patterns on failure time the variation of safety factor with time during the rainfall showed great differences among the four different rainfall patterns see figs 7 and 8 and the failure time had a regular order the shallow landslides caused by the advanced rainfall always happened first among the four patterns when the rainfall depth and duration were same for the landslides occurring above infiltration wetting front the decrease of safety factor with soil depth was the earliest and fastest under the advanced rainfall while it was the latest and slowest under the delayed rainfall fig 8 among all the four rainfall patterns the average rainfall intensity of the advanced pattern was the largest for a period after rainfall started and the large amount of precipitation infiltrated into the soil layer increased pore pressure and caused shallow landslide the earliest among the four rainfall patterns a comparison between the intermediated and uniform pattern revealed that the decreasing rate of safety factor was larger for the uniform pattern than the intermediated pattern during the first half of the rainfall this is because the accumulated rainfall depth in the first half of the rainfall under the intermediated pattern was less than the uniform pattern the relationship was opposite for the latter half of rainfall according to this and the 150 mm failure threshold the intermediated rainfall caused landslides earlier than the uniform rainfall when the rainfall depth were 150 mm and 200 mm and the sequence was reversed when rainfall depth was 400 mm for the shallow landslides triggered by the accumulative infiltrated water on the soil bedrock interface the decreasing rate of safety factor for the advanced pattern was also the largest among the four patterns fig 7 the shallow landslide under the advanced rainfall pattern occurred earliest among all the rainfall patterns these findings provide reference information for disaster prevention and loss mitigation predicting rainfall pattern based on forecasted total rainfall depth and real time rainfall intensity can help estimate occurrence of shallow landslides and time window for evacuation 4 4 2 impacts of rainfall patterns on failure depths rainfall patterns had limited effect on failure depths in these simulations for the soil above the failure planes reached similar high moisture content when landslides occurred it was only found that the failure plane caused by the delayed pattern rainfall was slightly shallower than the other three patterns under the delayed pattern low rainfall intensity at the beginning of rainfall caused a slow increase of soil moisture content the soil above the failure plane can have higher soil moisture content than the other three patterns before high intensity rainfall came later therefore the failure depth under the delayed pattern rainfall was shallower than other rainfall patterns 5 conclusion rainfall induced shallow landslides mechanisms were studied in a modelling approach in this study the hydrologic response simulations and slope stability estimates were conducted with the integrated hydrology model inhm and the infinite slope stability model the landslides characteristics e g the failure time and depths under every rainfall event were calculated and compared changes of pore pressure and safety factor during the rainfall were also evaluated and analyzed when the initial groundwater table was below the soil bedrock interface it showed that two types of shallow landslides occurred under different rainfall characteristics one type was caused by direct suction loss during the infiltration stage however another type occurred neither behind the downward wetting front nor below the rising groundwater table the triggering mechanism of this type was a novel one a significant vertical change in saturated hydrologic conductivity causes the accumulation of infiltrated water and subsequently leading to an increase pore pressures and landslide in unsaturated soil layer the novel mechanism of shallow landslide occurred after the wetting front infiltration stage and before the groundwater rising stage making the corresponding relationship between the infiltrated water movement stages and the failure mechanisms more complete more importantly this type of shallow landslides could cause larger landslide volume even with smaller total rainfall depths in addition the failure types and characteristics were largely influenced by the rainfall characteristics 1 the failure types were related to the rainfall depths as the novel mechanism of shallow landslide happened when the total rainfall depths were smaller 2 the rainfall patterns had great impacts on the failure time as the advanced rainfall always triggered the landslides earliest under each mechanism this work expands our understanding about shallow landslides and could have important application in alleviating the loss of lives and property in addition the method has a potential to be a toolbox for shallow landslides prediction acknowledgments this research was financially supported by national natural

7176,regionalization and pooling stations to form homogeneous regions or communities are essential for reliable parameter transfer prediction in ungauged basins and estimation of missing information over the years several clustering methods have been proposed for regional analysis most of these methods are able to quantify the study region in terms of homogeneity but fail to provide microscopic information about the interaction between communities as well as about each station within the communities we propose a complex network based approach to extract this valuable information and demonstrate the potential of our approach using a rainfall network constructed from the indian gridded daily precipitation data the communities were identified using the network theoretical community detection algorithm for maximizing the modularity further the grid points nodes were classified into universal roles according to their pattern of within and between community connections the method thus yields zoomed in details of individual rainfall grids within each community keywords complex network event synchronization rainfall network z p approach 1 introduction reliable and accurate information about precipitation is essential for most hydrological studies for example precipitation observations are required for the design of hydraulic structures flood estimation and forecasting assessment of water availability or climate impact studies however in most situations raingauges are scarce requiring knowledge about how precipitation characteristics at neighboring stations are related these interrelationships can be viewed in a statistical sense e g by applying correlation analysis in a physical sense as in dynamical meteorology or in a topological sense as in complex network analysis knowledge of these interrelationships will be crucial for various purposes including 1 applying interpolation extrapolation techniques to generate rainfall at locations where raingauge measurements are not available yang et al 2015 2 filling gaps in historical rainfall records using available rainfall observations at neighboring stations jha et al 2015 3 determining the optimal density and locations for the installation of new raingauges mishra and coulibaly 2009 pardo igúzquiza 1998 and 4 analysing regional flood frequency hassan and ping 2012 smith et al 2015 zrinji and burn 1994 1996 even though there is a plethora of methods available for identifying homogeneous regions such as clustering algorithms agarwal et al 2016 hsu and li 2010 principal component analysis darand and mansouri daneshvar 2014 region of influence approach zrinji and burn 1994 1996 or multiple regression sivakumar et al 2015 there are some important challenges which need to be addressed a common assumption in studies razavi and coulibaly 2013 salinas et al 2013 dealing with interpolation extrapolation missing values and prediction in ungauged basins pub is that the variables of interest such as precipitation characteristics at nearby points are more closely related than those at distant points as described by tobler 1970 in his first law of geography this assumption is also the foundation of geostatistics which in turn is fundamental to many classical approaches to spatial data analysis and interpolation throughout hydrology and other geoscientific disciplines while this assumption is often reasonable it may not hold in every situation especially in regions with complex topography jha et al 2015 in such areas statistics of rainfall recorded at neighboring stations can significantly vary due to the high topographic gradients ozturk et al 2018 and hence changes in rainfall patterns between them berndtsson 1988 li et al 2014 niu 2013 özger et al 2010 a significant disadvantage of these methods is that the selection of factors for identifying the similarity in rainfall patterns is highly subjective they rely on the preconceived notion of the existence of linear relationship between the factors that influence the precipitation in a region for instance in pca method the subjectivity is introduced in terms of extraction method rotation method number of components to be retained etc for more details refer to saxena et al 2017 more importantly the traditional methods for pooling stations within homogeneous regions are not capable of unraveling the role of each raingauge station within the community this includes the interactions within the community the role of the stations and the strength and number of inter and intra community connections the main aim of this paper is to address this last point by proposing a network based approach for unravelling the role of each node in a community this microscopic analysis is essential to understand the role of each of the member stations of the community and is very useful in many applications for example by knowing the connections and their strength it is possible to reduce the uncertainty of predictions at ungauged locations by including only those stations that have strong connections in that community similarly the reliability of filling gaps in observational time series can be improved by identifying the stations that share strong connections with that particular station the relative importance of the stations in the community will also help in understanding the connection between the communities and is particularly useful for selecting stations that share characteristics with more than one community in the context of connections within rainfall systems recent developments in network theory especially regarding complex networks have been found useful for identifying the spatial connections in rainfall malik et al 2012 steinhaeuser et al 2010 explored the utility of complex networks to analyze climate data i e air temperature pressure relative humidity and perceptible water they used the walktrap community detection algorithm to identify communities they concluded that these communities have a climatological interpretation and that alterations in community structure can be an indicator of climatic events tsonis et al 2011 applied complex networks and modularity based community detection to observed and simulated model data and concluded that the complexity of the system condenses into small interacting components called communities this approach provided information about the nature of different climate subsystems jha et al 2015 demonstrated the use of the clustering coefficient a complex network based measure stolbova et al 2014 on two rainfall networks in australia they attempted to relate the strength of spatial connections in rainfall to topographic and rainfall properties towards identifying dominant factors governing spatial connections and for offering a better physical interpretation on spatial rainfall variability eustace et al 2015 identified community structures by proposing local community neighborhoods ratio algorithm and showed that the algorithm detects well defined communities in networks by a wide margin conticello et al 2017 applied the louvain community detection algorithm to identify clusters of rainfall stations using the concept of event synchronization and self organizing maps even though the study of halverson and fleming 2015 on streamflow regionalization is not directly relevant for rainfall it showed that the choice of the community detection algorithm does not strongly impact the community structure all above mentioned studies have used complex network based community detection algorithm to identify homogenous regions but little attention has been paid to the different characteristics or roles of each of the member stations of a community although halverson and fleming 2015 have identified the high priority stations based on high betweenness centrality values but have not discussed the role of other stations this study shows that the microscopic analysis of homogeneous regions provides additional insights into the behavior and dynamics of single stations within the homogeneous region which can be vital for many engineering and water management purposes this study builds on emerging ideas in the very fast evolving field of complex network theory and contributes to work in hydro monitoring system design although studies in different fields such as physics quian quiroga et al 2002b quiroga et al 2000 or neurology rubinov and sporns 2010 zhou et al 2007 have seen immense use of complex network theory event synchronization and z p space our study is the first combined application of these methods in hydrology to date it clearly demonstrates the large potential of these methods in hydrology as advancement to the research in the application of complex networks in rainfall network analysis we use a network based measure to provide a comprehensive analysis of the stations in a community and their roles for this we apply the concept of cartographic representation of networks by guimera and amaral 2005 the proposed approach is demonstrated using the synthetic network and then applied to the indian precipitation gridded precipitation dataset the paper is organized in the following manner section 2 describes the basic aspects of network construction and network measurement and section 3 briefly discusses the methods used in the study the application of the methodology and the subsequent results obtained are discussed in detail in section 4 the conclusions are reported in section 5 2 methods 2 1 network definition a network or a graph is a collection of entities nodes vertices interconnected by lines links edges as shown in fig 1 these entities could be anything from humans defining social networks arenas et al 2008 computers in web networks zlatić et al 2006 neurons of the brain pfurtscheller and lopes da silva 1999 zhou et al 2007 streamflow stations defining hydrological networks halverson and fleming 2015 sivakumar and woldemeskel 2014 to raingauge stations defining climate networks stolbova et al 2014 malik et al 2012 rheinwalt et al 2016 formally a network or graph is defined as an ordered pair g n e containing a set of nodes n n 1 n 2 nn together with a set e of edges i j which are 2 element subsets of n in this work we consider undirected and unweighted graph g where only one edge can exist between a pair of nodes and self loops of the type i i are not allowed hence edges simply show connections between nodes and each edge can be traversed in either direction this type of graph can be represented by the symmetrical adjacency matrix stolbova et al 2014 1 a i j 0 i j e 1 i j e fig 1 is a simple example of an undirected and unweighted network in general large graphs with non trivial topological characteristics used to represent real systems are called complex networks to define whether a link between two nodes exists any similarity measure can be used such as correlation donges et al 2009 jha et al 2015 synchronization conticello et al 2017 malik et al 2012 stolbova et al 2016 or mutual information paluš 2018 depending on the topological structure of the network groups of nodes can be pooled together forming communities jha et al 2015 2 2 event synchronization we use event synchronization stolbova et al 2014 to define whether a link between two nodes exists event synchronization es has been specifically designed to calculate nonlinear relations between timeseries with events defined on them a simple algorithm proposed by quian quiroga et al 2002a can be used for any time series for which we can define events such as single neuron recordings epileptiform spikes in electroencephalograms eeg heartbeats stock market crashes or rainfall events when dealing with signals of a different character the events could be defined differently in each time series since their common cause might manifest itself differently in different time series es has advantages over other time delayed correlation techniques e g pearson lag correlation as it uses a dynamic not fixed time delay agarwal et al 2018 2017 the latter refers to a time delay that is adjusted according to the two time series being compared which allows its application to different situations another advantage of es is that it can be applied to non gaussian data stolbova et al 2014 tass et al 1998 having its roots in neuroscience es only considers events beyond a threshold and ignores the absolute magnitude of events which could be a challenge to incorporate in future work a number of modifications have been proposed to the basic algorithm considering various issues such as boundary effects or bias toward the number of events agarwal et al 2017 rheinwalt et al 2016 the modified algorithm proposed by rheinwalt et al 2016 can be explained as follows an event above a threshold α percentile occurs in the signals x t and y t at times t l x and t m y where l 1 2 3 4 sx m 1 2 3 4 sy and within a time lag τ lm xy which is defined as stolbova et al 2014 2 τ lm xy min t l 1 x t l x t l x t l 1 x t m 1 y t m y t m y t m 1 y 2 where sx and sy are the total number of events greater than the threshold α in the signals x t and y t respectively this definition of the time lag helps to separate independent events which in turn allows to take into account the fact that different processes are responsible for the generation of events to count the number of times an event occurs in x t after it appears in y t and vice versa c x y and c y x are defined as follows 3 c x y l 1 s x m 1 s y j xy and 4 j xy 1 if 0 t l x t m y τ lm xy 1 2 if t l x t m y 0 else c y x is defined accordingly and from these quantities we obtain 5 q xy c x y c y x s x 2 s y 2 qxy is a measure of the strength of the event synchronization between x t and y t it is normalized to 0 q xy 1 this implies that qxy 1 for perfect synchronization between x t and y t 2 3 network construction to construct a rainfall network each grid cell is considered as a node and links between each pair of nodes are setup based on the statistical relationship between them the similarity measure used is the es which gives a q matrix eq 5 applying a certain threshold θ on the q matrix eq 5 we yield an adjacency matrix rewriting eq 1 6 a i j 1 if q i j θ i j q 0 else here θ i j q 95 th percentile is a chosen threshold and ai j 1 denotes a link between the ith and jth nodes and 0 denotes otherwise the adjacency matrix represents the connections in the rainfall network in this study we use an undirected network meaning we do not consider which of the two synchronized events happened first in order to avoid the possibility of misleading directionalities of event occurrences between nodes that are topographically close to one another 2 4 network measures to analyze and quantify the topological features of complex networks a large number of network measures have been introduced blondel et al 2008 malik et al 2016 we use the within module degree z score z and the participation coefficient p guimera and amaral 2005 to investigate the role of individual nodes within a community z identifies hubs and non hubs within the community hubs are nodes with a significantly larger number of links compared to the other nodes in the network p is a measure of the diversity of the connections between individual nodes and identifies to which extent a node has intra community or inter community links the within module degree zi or z score is a within community version of degree centrality total number of link of any node and shows how well a node is connected to other nodes in the same community it is estimated as guimera and amaral 2005 7 z i k i k s i σ k s i where ki is the total number of links degree of node i in the community si k s i is the average degree of all nodes in the community si and σ k s i is the standard deviation of k in si since two nodes having the same z score may play different roles within the community this measure is often combined with the participation coefficient pi the participation coefficient pi compares the number of links of node i to nodes in all communities with the number of links within its own community we define the pi of node i as guimera and amaral 2005 8 p i 1 s j 1 n m k is j k i 2 where k is j is the number of links of node i to nodes in community sj and ki is the total number of links degree of node i nm represent the number of communities in the network the participation coefficient of a node is therefore close to one if its links are uniformly distributed among all the communities and zero if its entire links are within its own community because in later case k is j k i hence pi 0 2 5 community detection complex networks often show subsets of nodes that are densely interconnected these subsets are called communities the community structure of a complex network provides insight into the network girvan and newman 2002 for instance different communities within a network may have very different properties compared to the averaged properties of the complete network there exist several community detection approaches aiming at stratifying the nodes into communities in an optimal way see fortunato 2010 for an extensive review the question which community detection algorithm should be used is difficult to answer however it has been found that the choice of the community detection algorithm has a small impact on the resultant communities in geophysical data science studies halverson and fleming 2015 in this study we use the louvain method which maximizes the modularity to find the optimal community structure in the network the optimal community structure is a subdivision of the network into non overlapping groups of nodes which maximizes the number of within group edges and minimizes the number of between group edges blondel et al 2008 rubinov and sporns 2011 modularity is defined besides a multiplicative constant as the number of edges falling within groups minus the expected number in an equivalent network with edges placed at random positive modularity values suggest the presence of communities thus one can search for community structures by looking for the network divisions that have positive and preferably large modularity values newman 2004 modularity m is calculated as 9 m 1 2 m i j a ij k i k j 2 m δ c i c j where aij represents the number of edges between i and j ki jaij is the sum of the number of the edges degree attached to vertex i ci is the community to which vertex i is assigned the δ function δ u v is 1 if u v and 0 otherwise and m 1 2 ijaij eq 9 is solved using the two step iterative algorithm proposed by blondel et al 2008 also known as the louvain method the first step consists in optimizing the modularity by permitting only a local modification of communities in the second step the communities identified are pooled to assemble a new network of communities high modularity networks are densely linked within communities but sparsely linked between communities the algorithm stops when the highest modularity is achieved the algorithm was implemented using the brain connectivity toolbox bct provided by rubinov and sporns 2010 and is available at https sites google com site bctnet 2 6 z p space approach following the approach proposed by guimera and amaral 2005 we calculate for each node the participation coefficient pi and the within module degree zi and plot all nodes onto the z p space both measures are calculated once the network communities have been determined guimera and amaral 2005 guimera et al 2007 guimera et al 2007 propose to divide the z p space into seven classes r1 r7 which express the different roles of the nodes table 1 in the first step the nodes are broadly categorized as hubs or non hubs using the within module degree z nodes with z 2 5 are classified as community hubs and nodes with z 2 5 as non hubs at the second level the hub and non hub nodes are further characterized using the participation coefficient hence each node is assigned to one of these seven classes nodes in the classes r1 and r5 with p 0 have almost all links within the own community since class r5 have provincial hubs table 1 which contain both intracommunity and intercommunity links the limit on the participation coefficient p 0 helps to identify nodes that have almost all intracommunity links these nodes with almost all intracommunity links p 0 are local centers in the region and can only be selected as a representative node of the community halverson and fleming 2015 nodes in the classes r2 and r3 are peripheral and satellite connectors respectively table 1 both the class contains hybrid non hub nodes which generally connect two different communities the only difference between r2 and r3 is that r3 nodes have more intercommunity links outside of its own community similarly r6 nodes represent the nodes that have many intercommunity links but are hubs in the given community we interpret them as hybrid hubs which have a maximum connection outside of its own community kinless nodes r4 have the greatest proportion of links outside the community and are interpreted as wrongly assigned nodes in the community if there exist many r4 nodes in the community a reformation of the communities or reallocation of such nodes to appropriate community is suggested the nodes in class r7 maintain homogeneous links with all the communities we surmise that such nodes may not be clearly associated with a single community hence termed as the global hubs or global connectors nodes connecting many different climate sub systems the above characterization of nodes is important as it helps in understanding their specific roles in terms of non hubs hubs local centers hybrid nodes global hubs in the context of climate systems local centers correspond to nodes which are important for local climate phenomena while bridges correspond to nodes which connect different subsystem of climatology leading to non local interaction teleconnections using the classification of table 1 fig 2 shows the z p space for the sample network of fig 1 and the assigned r classes node 1 is a hub in community 1 having all of its nodes within the community and hence can be considered as a representative station node 4 of community 1 non hub has intercommunity links and thus falls in the r2 class for community 2 station 6 is a representative node with all links within the community and the non hub node 5 has intercommunity links falling in class r2 there is no kinless node r4 and r7 in both communities if there exists a node fully unsynchronized to the other nodes in the network i e there are no links to other nodes the proposed z p approached will detect this station given its unique characteristics this unsynchronized station will lie at the origin of z p space and will fall in a community on its own as an extreme example one might imagine that in a meteorological sub region characterized by fine scale convective thunderstorms with sparse raingauge coverage precipitation event synchronization across all raingauges in that sub region would be poor and each station would form a separate community 3 model application the method was tested on a gridded rainfall dataset for two reasons i the availability and the access to raingauge data is limited and ii gridded datasets provide an effective platform to understand the precipitation dynamics owing to the assumptions underlying the spatial interpolation the gridding process used to build the dataset might affect the relationships between nodes however these effects can be neglected considering the extent of the study area the high resolution 0 25 0 25 daily gridded rainfall data pai et al 2015 was developed by the indian meteorological department imd for a spatial domain of 66 5 e to 100 e and 6 5 n to 38 5 n covering the mainland region of india the gridded data was generated from the observed data of 6995 gauging stations across india using spatial interpolation for the period 1901 2013 several studies in the past using the same dataset have reported such as downscaling lakhanpal et al 2017 sehgal et al 2016 and rainfall variability krishnamurthy and shukla 2000 this shows that the data are highly accurate and capable of capturing the spatial distribution of rainfall over the country in this study out of total 17415 grid stations 4631 stations were identified for which continuous rainfall data for 63 years jan 1951 to dec 2013 was available without any missing values the rainfall network is constructed as explained in section 2 3 by extracting an event series from 4631 raingauges fig 3 i e by applying a threshold we identify extreme rainfall events in the given time series agarwal et al 2017 rheinwalt et al 2015 we define extreme events as precipitation that is greater than the 95th percentile at that station the 95th percentile is a good compromise between having a sufficient number of events at each location and a rather high threshold to study heavy precipitation next we compute the q eq 5 between each pair of 4631 rainfall grid points applying a threshold θ i j q 95 th percentile on the q matrix eq 5 yields an adjacency matrix eq 6 representing the connections in the rainfall network in this study we use an undirected network meaning we do not consider which of the two synchronized events happened first in order to avoid the possibility of misleading directionalities of event occurrences between rain gauges that are topographically close to one another after formation of the rainfall network we aimed to obtain a small set of communities representing relevant sub processes of the rainfall network in this study we apply louvain algorithm section 2 5 on the constructed network to unravel the community structure the resultant community structure is the rainfall network mapped in fig 3 the obtained community structure fig 3 shows some similar patterns to those provided by the indian institute of tropical meteorology vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 and malik et al 2016 it is also important to emphasize that the formation of the regions using complex networks is based on a cluster of actual connections rather than on our traditional criteria of geographic proximity nearest neighbors regional patterns and linear correlations table 2 shows the geographical and statistical interpretation of the resultant community which includes the mean standard deviation and coefficient of skewness of the precipitation distribution for each community higher mean precipitation shows a greater total amount of precipitation a larger standard deviation shows a stronger variation of data for the collecting period and a larger coefficient of skewness indicates more extreme monthly precipitation events hsu and li 2010 considering statistical properties community 4 fig 3 which covers almost all of the greenest and most mountainous regions of india northeastern india has the highest monthly mean 150 89 mm the largest variation 178 92 mm and low skewness 1 6 of precipitation in the region table 2 meanwhile community 5 fig 3 covering dry and lowland areas northwestern india shows the lowest monthly mean 48 26 mm with lower variation community 6 western coastline shows the greatest skewness along with high variability one possible reason for the high variability and skewness could be that these regions are near to both coastlines and are low lying areas with two different climate regimes arid and humid community 3 southeastern india shows a high coefficient of skewness 1 91 and second high monthly rainfall 105 01 mm and variability 154 69 mm all the communities show the positive coefficient of skewness which indicates precipitation with a long tail toward high values community 7 mountainous region shows low monthly precipitation mean moderate variability and high skewness in south india both communities 1 and 2 fig 3 almost have similar rainfall characteristics but are differentiated by topological elevation land coastline features further using a node to node connection approach guimera et al 2007 guimera and amaral 2005 we explore the microscopic details of each individual station within the community we fit all raingauges of the rainfall network in the zp space fig 4 according to the estimated network measures section 2 4 of the within module degree z and participation coefficient p fig 4 shows the z p space plot for each community c1 to c7 separately table 3 shows the percentage of each class of stations in each community from fig 4 and table 3 we find that none of the communities has a kinless node r4 class node i e no wrongly assigned node this explains the robustness of the method edge betweenness used for clustering it can be seen that all the communities c1 to c6 have a dominance of hybrid nodes in their respective community except for community 7 which shows the dominance of nodes with intra community links this observation falls along the expected lines as the indian sub continent s precipitation shows the vast variability in topography climate diversity etc the results are quite different from those shown by agarwal et al 2017 for german regions in germany the raingauge stations were mostly connected by intra community links indicating more homogeneity in the precipitation compared to indian precipitation as explained in section 2 6 stations with the almost all p 0 intra community links can be considered a spatially representative station of the community we argue that such stations have climatological properties rainfall time series that are representative of the other members of their respective communities halverson and fleming 2015 this information has significant importance in big data analysis and uncertainty analysis as the information from the entire community is available in the form of the representative station further analyzing the z p space we see that the eastern coastline region c1 to some extent shows good interconnectedness high number of r1 and r2 and also does not show any hubs r5 to r7 in the region this suggests that rainfall in this region is more localized and does not show any long range connections this is in congruence with the general understanding that the eastern coastline region is dominated by the northeastern ne monsoonal rainfall while the rest of the country receives rainfall from southwestern sw monsoons jain et al 2013 the mild and moderate elevation inland regions of india c2 c3 c5 and c6 show negligible intracommunity links r1 compared to other high elevation regions c4 and c7 and low elevation regions c1 these mild and moderate elevation regions c2 c3 c5 and c6 are strongly dominated by hybrid stations r3 and r6 sharing some common dynamics with other regions for instance c2 southeast and c3 central east have very few nodes in the r1 class the majority of nodes fall in r2 and a significant amount in r3 class stations this shows that the southeastern and central eastern regions of the country have short range and long range connections a significant number of r6 class stations reveal that the long range connections are prevalent over these regions the ability to detect both short range and long range connections is one of the advantages of the complex network approach used in this study compared to commonly used geostatistical methods which are based on the assumption of a semi variogram having a decreasing correlation with increasing distance similarly the western coastline c6 of india is also dominated equally by r2 and r3 class stations representing short and long range connection dynamics in the region on the contrary the central western region c5 of india is strongly dominated by only r3 class type stations having a maximum number of links outside the community this suggests that central western c5 regions have no intra community links to stations the above observations fall along the expected lines since westerlies enter in india from the west and travel to an entirely different part because of a lack of sufficient orographic barriers we do not see any localized rainfall in this region the northeastern region of india c4 shows a unique kind of pattern with a significant number of intra community links inter community links connector hubs and global hubs this region has a sufficient number of orographic barriers which helps to accumulate more localized rainfall represented by short range connections hence some of the rainfall features in this area are regionally bound and short range this region also shows a significant number of inter community links owing to its long range connections with the easterlies moisture movement from the c5 regions the himalayan region c7 shows dominance of r1 class stations representing a very high degree of interconnectedness in the region in other words it suggests that this region receives localized rainfall having short range connections also it can be said from the results that this region features a different climatology characterized by seasonal snow and a colder climate than the rest of the regions furthermore it is entirely possible that this region may have connections to regions beyond what is considered in the present study from the above analysis we infer that z p space is a useful tool to provide more insight into the qualitative and quantitative connections between the nodes within and outside a community it also shows the strength of the connections between the communities and is useful in understanding how extreme events in one community affect the other regions the physical reasoning for the classification of the nodes into seven classes is inline with the general understanding of the precipitation dynamics in india 4 conclusion this study proposed a novel complex network based approach for quantifying the role of a single rainfall station within homogeneous regions which is of great interest in regionalization studies estimating missing information etc the study used a network information theoretical approach known as z p space for understanding the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the members of a community the z p approach categorizes the members into different classes based on the relative roles they play in the community and their strength of connections within and outside the community the utility of the method was demonstrated using a synthetic case and then applied to the real world case of the indian rainfall network the entire indian rainfall network was divided into seven communities and each community was analyzed using the z p approach the results from the z p space approach provided important information such as how the communities are connected within themselves and with others it was observed that the high elevation northern part of india was disconnected from other regions communities on the other hand the southern peninsular region had strong intra community links as well as inter community links it was also observed that the central and eastern parts of the country had many connector hubs indicating that these regions have long range connections with other communities the stations from the northeastern regions of the country interestingly have strong connections with other communities the results of the study have significant implication in identifying key node locations in climate systems which play a major role in affecting the climate in the given community 5 competing interests the authors

7176,regionalization and pooling stations to form homogeneous regions or communities are essential for reliable parameter transfer prediction in ungauged basins and estimation of missing information over the years several clustering methods have been proposed for regional analysis most of these methods are able to quantify the study region in terms of homogeneity but fail to provide microscopic information about the interaction between communities as well as about each station within the communities we propose a complex network based approach to extract this valuable information and demonstrate the potential of our approach using a rainfall network constructed from the indian gridded daily precipitation data the communities were identified using the network theoretical community detection algorithm for maximizing the modularity further the grid points nodes were classified into universal roles according to their pattern of within and between community connections the method thus yields zoomed in details of individual rainfall grids within each community keywords complex network event synchronization rainfall network z p approach 1 introduction reliable and accurate information about precipitation is essential for most hydrological studies for example precipitation observations are required for the design of hydraulic structures flood estimation and forecasting assessment of water availability or climate impact studies however in most situations raingauges are scarce requiring knowledge about how precipitation characteristics at neighboring stations are related these interrelationships can be viewed in a statistical sense e g by applying correlation analysis in a physical sense as in dynamical meteorology or in a topological sense as in complex network analysis knowledge of these interrelationships will be crucial for various purposes including 1 applying interpolation extrapolation techniques to generate rainfall at locations where raingauge measurements are not available yang et al 2015 2 filling gaps in historical rainfall records using available rainfall observations at neighboring stations jha et al 2015 3 determining the optimal density and locations for the installation of new raingauges mishra and coulibaly 2009 pardo igúzquiza 1998 and 4 analysing regional flood frequency hassan and ping 2012 smith et al 2015 zrinji and burn 1994 1996 even though there is a plethora of methods available for identifying homogeneous regions such as clustering algorithms agarwal et al 2016 hsu and li 2010 principal component analysis darand and mansouri daneshvar 2014 region of influence approach zrinji and burn 1994 1996 or multiple regression sivakumar et al 2015 there are some important challenges which need to be addressed a common assumption in studies razavi and coulibaly 2013 salinas et al 2013 dealing with interpolation extrapolation missing values and prediction in ungauged basins pub is that the variables of interest such as precipitation characteristics at nearby points are more closely related than those at distant points as described by tobler 1970 in his first law of geography this assumption is also the foundation of geostatistics which in turn is fundamental to many classical approaches to spatial data analysis and interpolation throughout hydrology and other geoscientific disciplines while this assumption is often reasonable it may not hold in every situation especially in regions with complex topography jha et al 2015 in such areas statistics of rainfall recorded at neighboring stations can significantly vary due to the high topographic gradients ozturk et al 2018 and hence changes in rainfall patterns between them berndtsson 1988 li et al 2014 niu 2013 özger et al 2010 a significant disadvantage of these methods is that the selection of factors for identifying the similarity in rainfall patterns is highly subjective they rely on the preconceived notion of the existence of linear relationship between the factors that influence the precipitation in a region for instance in pca method the subjectivity is introduced in terms of extraction method rotation method number of components to be retained etc for more details refer to saxena et al 2017 more importantly the traditional methods for pooling stations within homogeneous regions are not capable of unraveling the role of each raingauge station within the community this includes the interactions within the community the role of the stations and the strength and number of inter and intra community connections the main aim of this paper is to address this last point by proposing a network based approach for unravelling the role of each node in a community this microscopic analysis is essential to understand the role of each of the member stations of the community and is very useful in many applications for example by knowing the connections and their strength it is possible to reduce the uncertainty of predictions at ungauged locations by including only those stations that have strong connections in that community similarly the reliability of filling gaps in observational time series can be improved by identifying the stations that share strong connections with that particular station the relative importance of the stations in the community will also help in understanding the connection between the communities and is particularly useful for selecting stations that share characteristics with more than one community in the context of connections within rainfall systems recent developments in network theory especially regarding complex networks have been found useful for identifying the spatial connections in rainfall malik et al 2012 steinhaeuser et al 2010 explored the utility of complex networks to analyze climate data i e air temperature pressure relative humidity and perceptible water they used the walktrap community detection algorithm to identify communities they concluded that these communities have a climatological interpretation and that alterations in community structure can be an indicator of climatic events tsonis et al 2011 applied complex networks and modularity based community detection to observed and simulated model data and concluded that the complexity of the system condenses into small interacting components called communities this approach provided information about the nature of different climate subsystems jha et al 2015 demonstrated the use of the clustering coefficient a complex network based measure stolbova et al 2014 on two rainfall networks in australia they attempted to relate the strength of spatial connections in rainfall to topographic and rainfall properties towards identifying dominant factors governing spatial connections and for offering a better physical interpretation on spatial rainfall variability eustace et al 2015 identified community structures by proposing local community neighborhoods ratio algorithm and showed that the algorithm detects well defined communities in networks by a wide margin conticello et al 2017 applied the louvain community detection algorithm to identify clusters of rainfall stations using the concept of event synchronization and self organizing maps even though the study of halverson and fleming 2015 on streamflow regionalization is not directly relevant for rainfall it showed that the choice of the community detection algorithm does not strongly impact the community structure all above mentioned studies have used complex network based community detection algorithm to identify homogenous regions but little attention has been paid to the different characteristics or roles of each of the member stations of a community although halverson and fleming 2015 have identified the high priority stations based on high betweenness centrality values but have not discussed the role of other stations this study shows that the microscopic analysis of homogeneous regions provides additional insights into the behavior and dynamics of single stations within the homogeneous region which can be vital for many engineering and water management purposes this study builds on emerging ideas in the very fast evolving field of complex network theory and contributes to work in hydro monitoring system design although studies in different fields such as physics quian quiroga et al 2002b quiroga et al 2000 or neurology rubinov and sporns 2010 zhou et al 2007 have seen immense use of complex network theory event synchronization and z p space our study is the first combined application of these methods in hydrology to date it clearly demonstrates the large potential of these methods in hydrology as advancement to the research in the application of complex networks in rainfall network analysis we use a network based measure to provide a comprehensive analysis of the stations in a community and their roles for this we apply the concept of cartographic representation of networks by guimera and amaral 2005 the proposed approach is demonstrated using the synthetic network and then applied to the indian precipitation gridded precipitation dataset the paper is organized in the following manner section 2 describes the basic aspects of network construction and network measurement and section 3 briefly discusses the methods used in the study the application of the methodology and the subsequent results obtained are discussed in detail in section 4 the conclusions are reported in section 5 2 methods 2 1 network definition

exist between a pair of nodes and self loops of the type i i are not allowed hence edges simply show connections between nodes and each edge can be traversed in either direction this type of graph can be represented by the symmetrical adjacency matrix stolbova et al 2014 1 a i j 0 i j e 1 i j e fig 1 is a simple example of an undirected and unweighted network in general large graphs with non trivial topological characteristics used to represent real systems are called complex networks to define whether a link between two nodes exists any similarity measure can be used such as correlation donges et al 2009 jha et al 2015 synchronization conticello et al 2017 malik et al 2012 stolbova et al 2016 or mutual information paluš 2018 depending on the topological structure of the network groups of nodes can be pooled together forming communities jha et al 2015 2 2 event synchronization we use event synchronization stolbova et al 2014 to define whether a link between two nodes exists event synchronization es has been specifically designed to calculate nonlinear relations between timeseries with events defined on them a simple algorithm proposed by quian quiroga et al 2002a can be used for any time series for which we can define events such as single neuron recordings epileptiform spikes in electroencephalograms eeg heartbeats stock market crashes or rainfall events when dealing with signals of a different character the events could be defined differently in each time series since their common cause might manifest itself differently in different time series es has advantages over other time delayed correlation techniques e g pearson lag correlation as it uses a dynamic not fixed time delay agarwal et al 2018 2017 the latter refers to a time delay that is adjusted according to the two time series being compared which allows its application to different situations another advantage of es is that it can be applied to non gaussian data stolbova et al 2014 tass et al 1998 having its roots in neuroscience es only considers events beyond a threshold and ignores the absolute magnitude of events which could be a challenge to incorporate in future work a number of modifications have been proposed to the basic algorithm considering various issues such as boundary effects or bias toward the number of events agarwal et al 2017 rheinwalt et al 2016 the modified algorithm proposed by rheinwalt et al 2016 can be explained as follows an event above a threshold α percentile occurs in the signals x t and y t at times t l x and t m y where l 1 2 3 4 sx m 1 2 3 4 sy and within a time lag τ lm xy which is defined as stolbova et al 2014 2 τ lm xy min t l 1 x t l x t l x t l 1 x t m 1 y t m y t m y t m 1 y 2 where sx and sy are the total number of events greater than the threshold α in the signals x t and y t respectively this definition of the time lag helps to separate independent events which in turn allows to take into account the fact that different processes are responsible for the generation of events to count the number of times an event occurs in x t after it appears in y t and vice versa c x y and c y x are defined as follows 3 c x y l 1 s x m 1 s y j xy and 4 j xy 1 if 0 t l x t m y τ lm xy 1 2 if t l x t m y 0 else c y x is defined accordingly and from these quantities we obtain 5 q xy c x y c y x s x 2 s y 2 qxy is a measure of the strength of the event synchronization between x t and y t it is normalized to 0 q xy 1 this implies that qxy 1 for perfect synchronization between x t and y t 2 3 network construction to construct a rainfall network each grid cell is considered as a node and links between each pair of nodes are setup based on the statistical relationship between them the similarity measure used is the es which gives a q matrix eq 5 applying a certain threshold θ on the q matrix eq 5 we yield an adjacency matrix rewriting eq 1 6 a i j 1 if q i j θ i j q 0 else here θ i j q 95 th percentile is a chosen threshold and ai j 1 denotes a link between the ith and jth nodes and 0 denotes otherwise the adjacency matrix represents the connections in the rainfall network in this study we use an undirected network meaning we do not consider which of the two synchronized events happened first in order to avoid the possibility of misleading directionalities of event occurrences between nodes that are topographically close to one another 2 4 network measures to analyze and quantify the topological features of complex networks a large number of network measures have been introduced blondel et al 2008 malik et al 2016 we use the within module degree z score z and the participation coefficient p guimera and amaral 2005 to investigate the role of individual nodes within a community z identifies hubs and non hubs within the community hubs are nodes with a significantly larger number of links compared to the other nodes in the network p is a measure of the diversity of the connections between individual nodes and identifies to which extent a node has intra community or inter community links the within module degree zi or z score is a within community version of degree centrality total number of link of any node and shows how well a node is connected to other nodes in the same community it is estimated as guimera and amaral 2005 7 z i k i k s i σ k s i where ki is the total number of links degree of node i in the community si k s i is the average degree of all nodes in the community si and σ k s i is the standard deviation of k in si since two nodes having the same z score may play different roles within the community this measure is often combined with the participation coefficient pi the participation coefficient pi compares the number of links of node i to nodes in all communities with the number of links within its own community we define the pi of node i as guimera and amaral 2005 8 p i 1 s j 1 n m k is j k i 2 where k is j is the number of links of node i to nodes in community sj and ki is the total number of links degree of node i nm represent the number of communities in the network the participation coefficient of a node is therefore close to one if its links are uniformly distributed among all the communities and zero if its entire links are within its own community because in later case k is j k i hence pi 0 2 5 community detection complex networks often show subsets of nodes that are densely interconnected these subsets are called communities the community structure of a complex network provides insight into the network girvan and newman 2002 for instance different communities within a network may have very different properties compared to the averaged properties of the complete network there exist several community detection approaches aiming at stratifying the nodes into communities in an optimal way see fortunato 2010 for an extensive review the question which community detection algorithm should be used is difficult to answer however it has been found that the choice of the community detection algorithm has a small impact on the resultant communities in geophysical data science studies halverson and fleming 2015 in this study we use the louvain method which maximizes the modularity to find the optimal community structure in the network the optimal community structure is a subdivision of the network into non overlapping groups of nodes which maximizes the number of within group edges and minimizes the number of between group edges blondel et al 2008 rubinov and sporns 2011 modularity is defined besides a multiplicative constant as the number of edges falling within groups minus the expected number in an equivalent network with edges placed at random positive modularity values suggest the presence of communities thus one can search for community structures by looking for the network divisions that have positive and preferably large modularity values newman 2004 modularity m is calculated as 9 m 1 2 m i j a ij k i k j 2 m δ c i c j where aij represents the number of edges between i and j ki jaij is the sum of the number of the edges degree attached to vertex i ci is the community to which vertex i is assigned the δ function δ u v is 1 if u v and 0 otherwise and m 1 2 ijaij eq 9 is solved using the two step iterative algorithm proposed by blondel et al 2008 also known as the louvain method the first step consists in optimizing the modularity by permitting only a local modification of communities in the second step the communities identified are pooled to assemble a new network of communities high modularity networks are densely linked within communities but sparsely linked between communities the algorithm stops when the highest modularity is achieved the algorithm was implemented using the brain connectivity toolbox bct provided by rubinov and sporns 2010 and is available at https sites google com site bctnet 2 6 z p space approach following the approach proposed by guimera and amaral 2005 we calculate for each node the participation coefficient pi and the within module degree zi and plot all nodes onto the z p space both measures are calculated once the network communities have been determined guimera and amaral 2005 guimera et al 2007 guimera et al 2007 propose to divide the z p space into seven classes r1 r7 which express the different roles of the nodes table 1 in the first step the nodes are broadly categorized as hubs or non hubs using the within module degree z nodes with z 2 5 are classified as community hubs and nodes with z 2 5 as non hubs at the second level the hub and non hub nodes are further characterized using the participation coefficient hence each node is assigned to one of these seven classes nodes in the classes r1 and r5 with p 0 have almost all links within the own community since class r5 have provincial hubs table 1 which contain both intracommunity and intercommunity links the limit on the participation coefficient p 0 helps to identify nodes that have almost all intracommunity links these nodes with almost all intracommunity links p 0 are local centers in the region and can only be selected as a representative node of the community halverson and fleming 2015 nodes in the classes r2 and r3 are peripheral and satellite connectors respectively table 1 both the class contains hybrid non hub nodes which generally connect two different communities the only difference between r2 and r3 is that r3 nodes have more intercommunity links outside of its own community similarly r6 nodes represent the nodes that have many intercommunity links but are hubs in the given community we interpret them as hybrid hubs which have a maximum connection outside of its own community kinless nodes r4 have the greatest proportion of links outside the community and are interpreted as wrongly assigned nodes in the community if there exist many r4 nodes in the community a reformation of the communities or reallocation of such nodes to appropriate community is suggested the nodes in class r7 maintain homogeneous links with all the communities we surmise that such nodes may not be clearly associated with a single community hence termed as the global hubs or global connectors nodes connecting many different climate sub systems the above characterization of nodes is important as it helps in understanding their specific roles in terms of non hubs hubs local centers hybrid nodes global hubs in the context of climate systems local centers correspond to nodes which are important for local climate phenomena while bridges correspond to nodes which connect different subsystem of climatology leading to non local interaction teleconnections using the classification of table 1 fig 2 shows the z p space for the sample network of fig 1 and the assigned r classes node 1 is a hub in community 1 having all of its nodes within the community and hence can be considered as a representative station node 4 of community 1 non hub has intercommunity links and thus falls in the r2 class for community 2 station 6 is a representative node with all links within the community and the non hub node 5 has intercommunity links falling in class r2 there is no kinless node r4 and r7 in both communities if there exists a node fully unsynchronized to the other nodes in the network i e there are no links to other nodes the proposed z p approached will detect this station given its unique characteristics this unsynchronized station will lie at the origin of z p space and will fall in a community on its own as an extreme example one might imagine that in a meteorological sub region characterized by fine scale convective thunderstorms with sparse raingauge coverage precipitation event synchronization across all raingauges in that sub region would be poor and each station would form a separate community 3 model application the method was tested on a gridded rainfall dataset for two reasons i the availability and the access to raingauge data is limited and ii gridded datasets provide an effective platform to understand the precipitation dynamics owing to the assumptions underlying the spatial interpolation the gridding process used to build the dataset might affect the relationships between nodes however these effects can be neglected considering the extent of the study area the high resolution 0 25 0 25 daily gridded rainfall data pai et al 2015 was developed by the indian meteorological department imd for a spatial domain of 66 5 e to 100 e and 6 5 n to 38 5 n covering the mainland region of india the gridded data was generated from the observed data of 6995 gauging stations across india using spatial interpolation for the period 1901 2013 several studies in the past using the same dataset have reported such as downscaling lakhanpal et al 2017 sehgal et al 2016 and rainfall variability krishnamurthy and shukla 2000 this shows that the data are highly accurate and capable of capturing the spatial distribution of rainfall over the country in this study out of total 17415 grid stations 4631 stations were identified for which continuous rainfall data for 63 years jan 1951 to dec 2013 was available without any missing values the rainfall network is constructed as explained in section 2 3 by extracting an event series from 4631 raingauges fig 3 i e by applying a threshold we identify extreme rainfall events in the given time series agarwal et al 2017 rheinwalt et al 2015 we define extreme events as precipitation that is greater than the 95th percentile at that station the 95th percentile is a good compromise between having a sufficient number of events at each location and a rather high threshold to study heavy precipitation next we compute the q eq 5 between each pair of 4631 rainfall grid points applying a threshold θ i j q 95 th percentile on the q matrix eq 5 yields an adjacency matrix eq 6 representing the connections in the rainfall network in this study we use an undirected network meaning we do not consider which of the two synchronized events happened first in order to avoid the possibility of misleading directionalities of event occurrences between rain gauges that are topographically close to one another after formation of the rainfall network we aimed to obtain a small set of communities representing relevant sub processes of the rainfall network in this study we apply louvain algorithm section 2 5 on the constructed network to unravel the community structure the resultant community structure is the rainfall network mapped in fig 3 the obtained community structure fig 3 shows some similar patterns to those provided by the indian institute of tropical meteorology vinnarasi and dhanya 2016 and malik et al 2016 it is also important to emphasize that the formation of the regions using complex networks is based on a cluster of actual connections rather than on our traditional criteria of geographic proximity nearest neighbors regional patterns and linear correlations table 2 shows the geographical and statistical interpretation of the resultant community which includes the mean standard deviation and coefficient of skewness of the precipitation distribution for each community higher mean precipitation shows a greater total amount of precipitation a larger standard deviation shows a stronger variation of data for the collecting period and a larger coefficient of skewness indicates more extreme monthly precipitation events hsu and li 2010 considering statistical properties community 4 fig 3 which covers almost all of the greenest and most mountainous regions of india northeastern india has the highest monthly mean 150 89 mm the largest variation 178 92 mm and low skewness 1 6 of precipitation in the region table 2 meanwhile community 5 fig 3 covering dry and lowland areas northwestern india shows the lowest monthly mean 48 26 mm with lower variation community 6 western coastline shows the greatest skewness along with high variability one possible reason for the high variability and skewness could be that these regions are near to both coastlines and are low lying areas with two different climate regimes arid and humid community 3 southeastern india shows a high coefficient of skewness 1 91 and second high monthly rainfall 105 01 mm and variability 154 69 mm all the communities show the positive coefficient of skewness which indicates precipitation with a long tail toward high values community 7 mountainous region shows low monthly precipitation mean moderate variability and high skewness in south india both communities 1 and 2 fig 3 almost have similar rainfall characteristics but are differentiated by topological elevation land coastline features further using a node to node connection approach guimera et al 2007 guimera and amaral 2005 we explore the microscopic details of each individual station within the community we fit all raingauges of the rainfall network in the zp space fig 4 according to the estimated network measures section 2 4 of the within module degree z and participation coefficient p fig 4 shows the z p space plot for each community c1 to c7 separately table 3 shows the percentage of each class of stations in each community from fig 4 and table 3 we find that none of the communities has a kinless node r4 class node i e no wrongly assigned node this explains the robustness of the method edge betweenness used for clustering it can be seen that all the communities c1 to c6 have a dominance of hybrid nodes in their respective community except for community 7 which shows the dominance of nodes with intra community links this observation falls along the expected lines as the indian sub continent s precipitation shows the vast variability in topography climate diversity etc the results are quite different from those shown by agarwal et al 2017 for german regions in germany the raingauge stations were mostly connected by intra community links indicating more homogeneity in the precipitation compared to indian precipitation as explained in section 2 6 stations with the almost all p 0 intra community links can be considered a spatially representative station of the community we argue that such stations have climatological properties rainfall time series that are representative of the other members of their respective communities halverson and fleming 2015 this information has significant importance in big data analysis and uncertainty analysis as the information from the entire community is available in the form of the representative station further analyzing the z p space we see that the eastern coastline region c1 to some extent shows good interconnectedness high number of r1 and r2 and also does not show any hubs r5 to r7 in the region this suggests that rainfall in this region is more localized and does not show any long range connections this is in congruence with the general understanding that the eastern coastline region is dominated by the northeastern ne monsoonal rainfall while the rest of the country receives rainfall from southwestern sw monsoons jain et al 2013 the mild and moderate elevation inland regions of india c2 c3 c5 and c6 show negligible intracommunity links r1 compared to other high elevation regions c4 and c7 and low elevation regions c1 these mild and moderate elevation regions c2 c3 c5 and c6 are strongly dominated by hybrid stations r3 and r6 sharing some common dynamics with other regions for instance c2 southeast and c3 central east have very few nodes in the r1 class the majority of nodes fall in r2 and a significant amount in r3 class stations this shows that the southeastern and central eastern regions of the country have short range and long range connections a significant number of r6 class stations reveal that the long range connections are prevalent over these regions the ability to detect both short range and long range connections is one of the advantages of the complex network approach used in this study compared to commonly used geostatistical methods which are based on the assumption of a semi variogram having a decreasing correlation with increasing distance similarly the western coastline c6 of india is also dominated equally by r2 and r3 class stations representing short and long range connection dynamics in the region on the contrary the central western region c5 of india is strongly dominated by only r3 class type stations having a maximum number of links outside the community this suggests that central western c5 regions have no intra community links to stations the above observations fall along the expected lines since westerlies enter in india from the west and travel to an entirely different part because of a lack of sufficient orographic barriers we do not see any localized rainfall in this region the northeastern region of india c4 shows a unique kind of pattern with a significant number of intra community links inter community links connector hubs and global hubs this region has a sufficient number of orographic barriers which helps to accumulate more localized rainfall represented by short range connections hence some of the rainfall features in this area are regionally bound and short range this region also shows a significant number of inter community links owing to its long range connections with the easterlies moisture movement from the c5 regions the himalayan region c7 shows dominance of r1 class stations representing a very high degree of interconnectedness in the region in other words it suggests that this region receives localized rainfall having short range connections also it can be said from the results that this region features a different climatology characterized by seasonal snow and a colder climate than the rest of the regions furthermore it is entirely possible that this region may have connections to regions beyond what is considered in the present study from the above analysis we infer that z p space is a useful tool to provide more insight into the qualitative and quantitative connections between the nodes within and outside a community it also shows the strength of the connections between the communities and is useful in understanding how extreme events in one community affect the other regions the physical reasoning for the classification of the nodes into seven classes is inline with the general understanding of the precipitation dynamics in india 4 conclusion this study proposed a novel complex network based approach for quantifying the role of a single rainfall station within homogeneous regions which is of great interest in regionalization studies estimating missing information etc the study used a network information theoretical approach known as z p space for understanding the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the members of a community the z p approach categorizes the members into different classes based on the relative roles they play in the community and their strength of connections within and outside the community the utility of the method was demonstrated using a synthetic case and then applied to the real world case of the indian rainfall network the entire indian rainfall network was divided into seven communities and each community was analyzed using the z p approach the results from the z p space approach provided important information such as how the communities are connected within themselves and with others it was observed that the high elevation northern part of india was disconnected from other regions communities on the other hand the southern peninsular region had strong intra community links as well as inter community links it was also observed that the central and eastern parts of the country had many connector hubs indicating that these regions have long range connections with other communities the stations from the northeastern regions of the country interestingly have strong connections with other communities the results of the study have significant implication in identifying key node locations in climate systems which play a major role in affecting the climate in the given community 5 competing interests the authors

7177,quantifying the role of embedded rock fragments in soil water processes on a slope is crucial for the application of rock fragments in soil and water conservation practice in this study a laboratory runoff and erosion experiment was conducted in the soils embedded with rock fragments including five rock fragment contents rc of 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 kg kg 1 in a metal flume under three slopes 5 10 and 15 results showed that the mean steady infiltration rate in the soil without rock fragment null was lower than that in the soils containing rock fragments low rock fragment contents of 0 1 0 2 kg kg 1 and high rock fragment contents of 0 3 0 4 kg kg 1 labelled as low and high respectively as slope gradient 5 but was higher than the latter two soils as slope gradients 10 and 15 initial infiltration rate significantly increased with rc p 0 05 runoff discharge was negatively related to rc as slope gradient 5 and was positively related to it as slope gradients 10 and 15 there was a steady sediment concentration sc after runoff generated as slope gradient 5 sediment discharge and soil erosion modulus for the treatment of high significantly increased with slope gradient p 0 05 reynolds number re decreased with rc and the other hydraulic parameters of friction coefficient f shear stress τ and stream power ω increase with rc in general the embedded rock fragment in the soil can accelerate soil erosion by changing the ratio of infiltration runoff surface roughness and related hydraulic parameters especially under higher slope gradients our findings suggest that using rock fragments to control soil erosion is workable only under the conditions of lower slope gradients and rock fragment contents abbreviations rc rock fragment content sc sediment concentration null soil without rock fragments low soil containing low rock fragment contents high soil containing high rock fragment contents keywords rock fragment runoff and sediment discharge sediment concentration soil loss 1 introduction soils containing rock fragments diameter 2 mm are widely distributed around the world especially in mountain areas chen et al 2011 poesen et al 1999 poesen and lavee 1994 zhang et al 2016 zhu and shao 2008 the rock fragments presented in surface soil are often being taken as an indicator of soil erosion and soil degradation gong and zhu 2016 huang and cai 2007 jiang et al 2014 mandal et al 2005 soil survey staff 2003 wijdenes and poesen 1999 they can influence slope hydrological processes such as infiltration runoff sediment yield and evaporation because they are different from soil particles in physical properties poesen 1986 wang et al 2012 zavala et al 2010 jomaa et al 2012 on the other hand rock fragments are often used to control soil erosion by covering soil surface or embedding into the soil in soil and water conservation practice however the role of rock fragments in soil water processes is still not well investigated resulting in poor information in this aspect which is unbeneficial for soil erosion control and soil and water resources management zhang et al 2016 the pattern that rock fragments occur in the soil plays a crucial role in slope hydrological processes brakensiek and rawls 1994 goossens 2005 smets et al 2011 poesen and lavee 1994 have summarized this point on the role of rock fragment in soil water processes it can be classified into three types as rock fragments 1 covering soil surface 2 embedding into surface soil and 3 below surface soil for the first pattern rock fragments can reduce slope sediment yield by depressing soil surface sealing and retard ponding slowing down surface runoff and increasing infiltration rate cerdà 2001 dadkhah and gifford 1980 poesen 1986 wang et al 2012 zavala et al 2010 rock fragments with this pattern can also protect the soil surface from raindrop impact and detach surface flow which further decreases overland flow and its transport capacity jomaa et al 2012 many studies have reported a negatively exponential relationship between sediment yield and rock fragment coverage de figueiredo and poesen 1998 moreover rock fragment size and content can exert effects on slope hydrological processes bunte and poesen 1994 hancock et al 2008 jomaa et al 2013 related studies have indicated that the short time response to soil erosion is mainly affected by antecedent moisture content bulk density and surface roughness whereas the long time response depends on rainfall intensity in general rock fragments covering soil surface has positive effects on slope hydrological processes e g reducing sediment yield hence has gotten widespread applications for controlling soil erosion in non paving roads and steep slopes along highway sides the second pattern is rock fragments embedding into the soil it is different from the first one cerdà 2001 de figueiredo and poesen 1998 martínez zavala and jordán 2008 mayor et al 2009 bunte and poesen 1994 poesen 1986 for this pattern the cohesion between soil particles and rock fragments dominates slope hydrological processes poesen 1986 the embedded rock fragments have weak effects on infiltration rate and runoff but a strong effect on sediment yield instead smets et al 2011 moreover the embedded rock fragments can induce local turbulences and make scour hole develop on the stoss side of the rock fragments increasing soil loss abrahams and parsons 1994 bunte and poesen 1994 in this case even a small number of rock fragments in the soil would significantly increase sediment yield rieke zapp et al 2007 due to the presence of local turbulences mainly controlled by the embedded rock fragments abrahams and parsons 1994 morris 1955 the third pattern is rock fragment below surface soil this soil is often being taken as a layered soil hence it is not concerned here when taking the three patterns as a whole it could be found that it is a natural process of soil erosion development in the soil containing rock fragments in the beginning soil covers rock fragments with soil erosion developing surface soil is eroded and the rock fragments exposure in the topsoil forming the pattern of rock fragments embedding into the soil with the further development of soil erosion the soil between the rock fragments is eroded totally and rock fragments cover soil shaping the first pattern mentioned above it is clear that the second pattern i e the rock fragments embedding into the soil is the most complicated because it is a transition status from the first pattern to the last one nowadays there are still no relevant parameters to distinguish soil erosion type for soil containing rock fragments except for the homogeneous soil beuselinck et al 2002 hence it is urgent to carry out related investigations to address the effects of embedded rock fragments on slope hydrological processes in this study the soils embedded with rock fragments were simulated to investigate the effects of embedded rock fragments on slope soil water processes under laboratory rainfall simulation the aims of this study were to 1 make a comparison of runoff sediment yield and sediment concentration among these soils and 2 address the reasons that the rock fragments affect slope hydrological processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials experiments were carried out in a rainfall simulation hall of the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau a metal flume with 3 m long 1 m wide and 0 35 m deep was used to simulate a slope experimental soil was 0 0 2 m surface soil collected from the local agricultural field the soil particle composition was shown in table 1 the average air dried soil water content was 3 the rock fragments were pebbles and collected from the weihe river their diameter range was 1 9 5 2 cm and their basic physical properties were shown in table 2 2 2 methods the soils embedded with different rock fragments were simulated through mixing experimental soil and the rock fragments the embedded rock fragment contents rc rock fragment dry mass rock fragment dry mass soil dry mass were set as 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 kg kg 1 the bulk density of the loaded soil was controlled as 1 35 g cm 3 the soil was loaded into the flume with a depth of 0 3 m based on the embedded rock fragment content soil bulk density and the loaded depth we first calculated the masses of soil and rock fragments required for each rock fragment content and mixed them well and then put the mixture into the flume slope gradients were set as 5 10 and 15 the rainfall intensity was 90 mm h 1 and rainfall duration was 60 min after runoff generated the runoff generation time from the beginning of rainfall to runoff generation was recorded using a stopwatch the runoff velocity was measured using dye tracer method the dye was potassium permanganate solution after runoff generated we collected runoff and sediment every 1 min into a small plastic bucket the bucket including runoff and sediment was weighted and then runoff and sediment were put into a metal container the container was dried in an oven and weighted to get the masses of the container and sediment we summarized the experimental soils into three treatments based on the values of rc 1 soil without rock fragments rc 0 kg kg 1 null 2 soil containing low rock fragment contents rc 0 1 0 2 kg kg 1 low and 3 soil containing high rock fragment contents rc 0 3 0 4 kg kg 1 high runoff volume can be calculated from 1 m r m t m s m b and 2 v r m r ρ w hence sediment yield is 3 m s m dt m c where

significance test and variance analysis for the calculated hydraulic parameters runoff and sediment discharge runoff coefficient and soil erosion modulus were evaluated by one way anova in the software spss version 18 0 all of the statistical tests were carried out using the spss and originpro version 9 1 3 results 3 1 infiltration rate the mean steady infiltration rate in the treatment of null the soil without rock fragments was lower than that in the treatments of low and high soils containing rock fragments as slope gradient 5 fig 1 a but was higher than the latter two soils as slope gradients 10 and 15 fig 1b and c also the rock fragment could cause a significant increase of initial infiltration rate iir for the experimental slope gradients p 0 05 3 2 runoff and sediment discharge slope gradient and rock fragment content exerted complicated effects on runoff fig 2 a as slope gradient 5 runoff discharge was negatively related to rock fragment content black line as slope gradient increased to 10 and 15 runoff discharge was positively related to rock fragment content blue lines however the runoff discharge for the three soils groups was basically at the same level on average blue dot line in fig 2a sediment discharge was different for all the treatments null low and high under the experimental slope gradient condition fig 2b when slope gradient 15 there was a weak relationship between rock fragment content and sediment yield but a relatively strong relationship existed between rock fragment content and slope gradient i e higher slope gradient corresponded higher sediment discharge black lines in fig 2b when slope became steep slope gradient 15 sediment discharge was much higher in the treatment of high than that in the other two treatments null and low fig 2b these results could be directly identified from the eroded soil surface images obtained after rainfall fig 3 3 3 sediment concentration the values of sediment concentration sc in the three treatment null low and high decreased in the beginning 10 min of rainfall under different slopes 5 10 and 15 after 10 min sc values had different change trends over time depending on rc and slope gradient when slope gradient 5 the sc values in the three soils basically kept stable at the remaining time 10 60 min fig 4 a when slope gradient 10 the sc values in the three soils had an increasing trend if taken as a whole and at the same time showed fluctuations over time fig 4b when slope gradient 15 the sc value in the treatment of null showed a sharp increase among 10 36 min and then decreased gradually in the remaining time as for the treatments of low and high the sc values always showed an increasing trend and the sc value in the treatment of high was much higher than that in the treatment of low fig 4c 3 4 runoff coefficient and soil erosion intensity runoff coefficient changed with a range of 0 52 0 75 for all experimental soils there was no significant difference among the experimental soils under different slope gradients and rcs fig 5 a p 0 05 as slope gradient 5 the mean runoff coefficient showed a decreasing tendency with the increase of rc as slope gradient increased to 10 and 15 the mean runoff coefficient presented an increasing tendency with the increase of rc soil erosion intensity was much different between the soils with the increase of slope gradient soil erosion modulus increased significantly fig 5b when slope gradients 5 and 10 there was no significant difference in soil erosion modulus between the soils p 0 05 as slope gradient 15 the maximum soil erosion modulus occurred with the treatment of high and it was almost twice higher than the treatments of null and low hydraulic parameters in the three treatments were shown in table 3 all slope runoff statuses were sheet slow due to all the froude numbers fr 1 as slope gradient 5 reynolds number re decreased with the increase of rc indicating that the presence of rock fragments causes turbulence due to an increase in slope surface roughness inversely as slope gradient increased to 10 and 15 the re values increased with the increase of rc indicating an increase in turbulence due to a decrease in viscosity weisbach friction coefficient f increased with the increase of rc implying an increase of sediment load and vice versa both shear stress τ and stream power ω increased with the increase of slope gradient indicating an increase in sediment load 4 discussions 4 1 effects of embedded rock fragments on soil water processes on the slope the embedded rock fragments can influence slope infiltration and runoff but their effects depend on both rc and slope gradient for instance they promote the infiltration rate under the gentle slope condition slope gradient 5 and depress it under higher slope gradients slope gradient 10 runoff is negatively related to rc under the gentle slope condition and is positively related to it under the steep slope condition though the rock fragments can affect runoff there is no significant difference in runoff discharge p 0 05 among the experimental soils and there is a significant difference in sediment discharge p 0 05 instead especially in the soils containing higher rcs these results are different from the findings by dadkhah and gifford 1980 poesen 1986 cerdà 2001 mandal et al 2005 smets et al 2011 and wang et al 2012 the reason may be mainly attributed to the pattern that the rock fragments occur in the soil rock fragments embedding into the soil in this study and rock fragments covering soil surface mostly in the other studies poesen and lavee 1994 have summarized this point on the role of rock fragment in soil water processes 4 2 reasons for the embedded rock fragments affecting runoff and sediment first of all the embedded rock fragments can change erosion pattern which is closely related to slope gradient raindrop splash erosion is the dominant at the beginning of the rainfall due to relatively dried slope surface jomaa et al 2010 and the effect of embedded rock fragments is weak resulting in a short duration peak value of sc in the initial time and then rapid decrease for all experimental soils however the sc value shows different change trends during the remaining time of the rainfall for instance the sc value is steady under the gentle slope condition slope gradient 5 and it fluctuates under the steep slope condition slope gradients 10 and 15 during 10 60 min rainfall process also we find an obvious increase in sc value when the slope gradient 10 fig 4b and c these results are disagreement with the results found by jomaa et al 2010 2012 2013 the reasons may be attributed to inter rill erosion being the dominant process under the gentle slope condition which could also be indirectly verified from the images in fig 3 when the slope gradient 10 the inter rill erosion process is dominant only at the beginning of the erosive events as the topsoil is saturated the erosion pathways are developed and runoff is concentrated the rill erosion process becomes the dominant one see fig 3 we estimate ω value critical stream power to distinguish soil erosion type for the experimental soils and the result shows that all ω values for the soils are less than the threshold value developed by beuselinck et al 2002 therefore in theory there is no rill erosion process during the rainfall event but visual observations support that the rill erosion is happened fig 3 the reason may be that the threshold value obtained in previous studies is not adaptive to the soils in this study beuselinck et al 2002 obtained a threshold value in the homogeneous soil while our experiments were carried out in the heterogeneous soil soils containing rock fragments further analyses indicate that the rock fragments affect slope hydrological process via changing hydraulic parameters such as reynolds number re weisbach friction coefficient f shear stress τ and stream power ω but there are complicated interactions between runoff sediment rock fragment content and slope gradient 4 3 implications of this study in most soil erosion models rock fragment cover is a parameter to represent the effect of rock fragment but it is not adaptive to the case of embedded rock fragments this study reveals that the embedded rock fragments can strongly affect slope hydrological processes such as infiltration runoff sediment and relevant hydraulic parameters depending on the embedded rock fragment content and slope gradient in this sense it should develop some proper parameters to quantify the pattern of the embedded rock fragments for improving the predictions of runoff and soil erosion in these models also our findings can provide guideline for soil and water conservation e g as using rock fragments to control soil erosion the best advantage is to make the rock fragments exposure not to embedding into the soil especially when slope gradient is higher than 5 5 conclusions the rock fragments embedded into the soil can change slope hydrological processes depending on slope gradient and the embedded rock fragment content they have weak effects on infiltration and runoff and relatively strong effects on sediment discharge and sediment concentration the soil contains high rock fragments own relatively lower steady infiltration rate both sediment discharge and soil erosion modulus significantly increase with slope gradient in this kind soil relevant hydraulic parameters can also be changed by the embedded rock fragment content the embedded rock fragments mainly affect the slope hydrological processes during the later stage of rainfall 10 60 min the change of surface roughness and the relationship between soil erosion and runoff caused by the rock fragments dominate slope hydrological processes which is intensively interacted by slope gradient our study suggests that the embedded rock fragments in the soil accelerate sediment yield and result in severe soil erosion especially under higher slope gradients acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant numbers 41371242 and

7177,quantifying the role of embedded rock fragments in soil water processes on a slope is crucial for the application of rock fragments in soil and water conservation practice in this study a laboratory runoff and erosion experiment was conducted in the soils embedded with rock fragments including five rock fragment contents rc of 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 kg kg 1 in a metal flume under three slopes 5 10 and 15 results showed that the mean steady infiltration rate in the soil without rock fragment null was lower than that in the soils containing rock fragments low rock fragment contents of 0 1 0 2 kg kg 1 and high rock fragment contents of 0 3 0 4 kg kg 1 labelled as low and high respectively as slope gradient 5 but was higher than the latter two soils as slope gradients 10 and 15 initial infiltration rate significantly increased with rc p 0 05 runoff discharge was negatively related to rc as slope gradient 5 and was positively related to it as slope gradients 10 and 15 there was a steady sediment concentration sc after runoff generated as slope gradient 5 sediment discharge and soil erosion modulus for the treatment of high significantly increased with slope gradient p 0 05 reynolds number re decreased with rc and the other hydraulic parameters of friction coefficient f shear stress τ and stream power ω increase with rc in general the embedded rock fragment in the soil can accelerate soil erosion by changing the ratio of infiltration runoff surface roughness and related hydraulic parameters especially under higher slope gradients our findings suggest that using rock fragments to control soil erosion is workable only under the conditions of lower slope gradients and rock fragment contents abbreviations rc rock fragment content sc sediment concentration null soil without rock fragments low soil containing low rock fragment contents high soil containing high rock fragment contents keywords rock fragment runoff and sediment discharge sediment concentration soil loss 1 introduction soils containing rock fragments diameter 2 mm are widely distributed around the world especially in mountain areas chen et al 2011 poesen et al 1999 poesen and lavee 1994 zhang et al 2016 zhu and shao 2008 the rock fragments presented in surface soil are often being taken as an indicator of soil erosion and soil degradation gong and zhu 2016 huang and cai 2007 jiang et al 2014 mandal et al 2005 soil survey staff 2003 wijdenes and poesen 1999 they can influence slope hydrological processes such as infiltration runoff sediment yield and evaporation because they are different from soil particles in physical properties poesen 1986 wang et al 2012 zavala et al 2010 jomaa et al 2012 on the other hand rock fragments are often used to control soil erosion by covering soil surface or embedding into the soil in soil and water conservation practice however the role of rock fragments in soil water processes is still not well investigated resulting in poor information in this aspect which is unbeneficial for soil erosion control and soil and water resources management zhang et al 2016 the pattern that rock fragments occur in the soil plays a crucial role in slope hydrological processes brakensiek and rawls 1994 goossens 2005 smets et al 2011 poesen and lavee 1994 have summarized this point on the role of rock fragment in soil water processes it can be classified into three types as rock fragments 1 covering soil surface 2 embedding into surface soil and 3 below surface soil for the first pattern rock fragments can reduce slope sediment yield by depressing soil surface sealing and retard ponding slowing down surface runoff and increasing infiltration rate cerdà 2001 dadkhah and gifford 1980 poesen 1986 wang et al 2012 zavala et al 2010 rock fragments with this pattern can also protect the soil surface from raindrop impact and detach surface flow which further decreases overland flow and its transport capacity jomaa et al 2012 many studies have reported a negatively exponential relationship between sediment yield and rock fragment coverage de figueiredo and poesen 1998 moreover rock fragment size and content can exert effects on slope hydrological processes bunte and poesen 1994 hancock et al 2008 jomaa et al 2013 related studies have indicated that the short time response to soil erosion is mainly affected by antecedent moisture content bulk density and surface roughness whereas the long time response depends on rainfall intensity in general rock fragments covering soil surface has positive effects on slope hydrological processes e g reducing sediment yield hence has gotten widespread applications for controlling soil erosion in non paving roads and steep slopes along highway sides the second pattern is rock fragments embedding into the soil it is different from the first one cerdà 2001 de figueiredo and poesen 1998 martínez zavala and jordán 2008 mayor et al 2009 bunte and poesen 1994 poesen 1986 for this pattern the cohesion between soil particles and rock fragments dominates slope hydrological processes poesen 1986 the embedded rock fragments have weak effects on infiltration rate and runoff but a strong effect on sediment yield instead smets et al 2011 moreover the embedded rock fragments can induce local turbulences and make scour hole develop on the stoss side of the rock fragments increasing soil loss abrahams and parsons 1994 bunte and poesen 1994 in this case even a small number of rock fragments in the soil would significantly increase sediment yield rieke zapp et al 2007 due to the presence of local turbulences mainly controlled by the embedded rock fragments abrahams and parsons 1994 morris 1955 the third pattern is rock fragment below surface soil this soil is often being taken as a layered soil hence it is not concerned here when taking the three patterns as a whole it could be found that it is a natural process of soil erosion development in the soil containing rock fragments in the beginning soil covers rock fragments with soil erosion developing surface soil is eroded and the rock fragments exposure in the topsoil forming the pattern of rock fragments embedding into the soil with the further development of soil erosion the soil between the rock fragments is eroded totally and rock fragments cover soil shaping the first pattern mentioned above it is clear that the second pattern i e the rock fragments embedding into the soil is the most complicated because it is a transition status from the first pattern to the last one nowadays there are still no relevant parameters to distinguish soil erosion type for soil containing rock fragments except for the homogeneous soil beuselinck et al 2002 hence it is urgent to carry out related investigations to address the effects of embedded rock fragments on slope hydrological processes in this study the soils embedded with rock fragments were simulated to investigate the effects of embedded rock fragments on slope soil water processes under laboratory rainfall simulation the aims of this study were to 1 make a comparison of runoff sediment yield and sediment concentration among these soils and 2 address the reasons that the rock fragments affect slope hydrological processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials experiments were carried out in a rainfall simulation hall of the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau a metal flume with 3 m long 1 m wide and 0 35 m deep was used to simulate a slope experimental soil was 0 0 2 m surface soil collected from the local agricultural field the soil particle composition was shown in table 1 the average air dried soil water content was 3 the rock fragments were pebbles and collected from the weihe river their diameter range was 1 9 5 2 cm and their basic physical properties were shown in table 2 2 2 methods the soils embedded with different rock fragments were simulated through mixing

of the loaded soil was controlled as 1 35 g cm 3 the soil was loaded into the flume with a depth of 0 3 m based on the embedded rock fragment content soil bulk density and the loaded depth we first calculated the masses of soil and rock fragments required for each rock fragment content and mixed them well and then put the mixture into the flume slope gradients were set as 5 10 and 15 the rainfall intensity was 90 mm h 1 and rainfall duration was 60 min after runoff generated the runoff generation time from the beginning of rainfall to runoff generation was recorded using a stopwatch the runoff velocity was measured using dye tracer method the dye was potassium permanganate solution after runoff generated we collected runoff and sediment every 1 min into a small plastic bucket the bucket including runoff and sediment was weighted and then runoff and sediment were put into a metal container the container was dried in an oven and weighted to get the masses of the container and sediment we summarized the experimental soils into three treatments based on the values of rc 1 soil without rock fragments rc 0 kg kg 1 null 2 soil containing low rock fragment contents rc 0 1 0 2 kg

null the soil without rock fragments was lower than that in the treatments of low and high soils containing rock fragments as slope gradient 5 fig 1 a but was higher than the latter two soils as slope gradients 10 and 15 fig 1b and c also the rock fragment could cause a significant increase of initial infiltration rate iir for the experimental slope gradients p 0 05 3 2 runoff and sediment discharge slope gradient and rock fragment content exerted complicated effects on runoff fig 2 a as slope gradient 5 runoff discharge was negatively related to rock fragment content black line as slope gradient increased to 10 and 15 runoff discharge was positively related to rock fragment content blue lines however the runoff discharge for the three soils groups was basically at the same level on average blue dot line in fig 2a sediment discharge was different for all the treatments null low and high under the experimental slope gradient condition fig 2b when slope gradient 15 there was a weak relationship between rock fragment content and sediment yield but a relatively strong relationship existed between rock fragment content and slope gradient i e higher slope gradient corresponded higher sediment discharge black lines in fig 2b when slope became steep slope gradient 15 sediment discharge was much higher in the treatment of high than that in the other two treatments null and low fig 2b these results could be directly identified from the eroded soil surface images obtained after rainfall fig 3 3 3 sediment concentration the values of sediment concentration sc in the three treatment null low and high decreased in the beginning 10 min of rainfall under different slopes 5 10 and 15 after 10 min sc values had different change trends over time depending on rc and slope gradient when slope gradient 5 the sc values in the three soils basically kept stable at the remaining time 10 60 min fig 4 a when slope gradient 10 the sc values in the three soils had an increasing trend if taken as a whole and at the same time showed fluctuations over time fig 4b when slope gradient 15 the sc value in the treatment of null showed a sharp increase among 10 36 min and then decreased gradually in the remaining time as for the treatments of low and high the sc values always showed an increasing trend and the sc value in the treatment of high was much higher than that in the treatment of low fig 4c 3 4 runoff coefficient and soil erosion intensity runoff coefficient changed with a range of 0 52 0 75 for all experimental soils there was no significant difference among the experimental soils under different slope gradients and rcs fig 5 a p 0 05 as slope gradient 5 the mean runoff coefficient showed a decreasing tendency with the increase of rc as slope gradient increased to 10 and 15 the mean runoff coefficient presented an increasing tendency with the increase of rc soil erosion intensity was much different between the soils with the increase of slope gradient soil erosion modulus increased significantly fig 5b when slope gradients 5 and 10 there was no significant difference in soil erosion modulus between the soils p 0 05 as slope gradient 15 the maximum soil erosion modulus occurred with the treatment of high and it was almost twice higher than the treatments of null and low hydraulic parameters in the three treatments were shown in table 3 all slope runoff statuses were sheet slow due to all the froude numbers fr 1 as slope gradient 5 reynolds number re decreased with the increase of rc indicating that the presence of rock fragments causes turbulence due to an increase in slope surface roughness inversely as slope gradient increased to 10 and 15 the re values increased with the increase of rc indicating an increase in turbulence due to a decrease in viscosity weisbach friction coefficient f increased with the increase of rc implying an increase of sediment load and vice versa both shear stress τ and stream power ω increased with the increase of slope gradient indicating an increase in sediment load 4 discussions 4 1 effects of embedded rock fragments on soil water processes on the slope the embedded rock fragments can influence slope infiltration and runoff but their effects depend on both rc and slope gradient for instance they promote the infiltration rate under the gentle slope condition slope gradient 5 and depress it under higher slope gradients slope gradient 10 runoff is negatively related to rc under the gentle slope condition and is positively related to it under the steep slope condition though the rock fragments can affect runoff there is no significant difference in runoff discharge p 0 05 among the experimental soils and there is a significant difference in sediment discharge p 0 05 instead especially in the soils containing higher rcs these results are different from the findings by dadkhah and gifford 1980 poesen 1986 cerdà 2001 mandal et al 2005 smets et al 2011 and wang et al 2012 the reason may be mainly attributed to the pattern that the rock fragments occur in the soil rock fragments embedding into the soil in this study and rock fragments covering soil surface mostly in the other studies poesen and lavee 1994 have summarized this point on the role of rock fragment in soil water processes 4 2 reasons for the embedded rock fragments affecting runoff and sediment first of all the embedded rock fragments can change erosion pattern which is closely related to slope gradient raindrop splash erosion is the dominant at the beginning of the rainfall due to relatively dried slope surface jomaa et al 2010 and the effect of embedded rock fragments is weak resulting in a short duration peak value of sc in the initial time and then rapid decrease for all experimental soils however the sc value shows different change trends during the remaining time of the rainfall for instance the sc value is steady under the gentle slope condition slope gradient 5 and it fluctuates under the steep slope condition slope gradients 10 and 15 during 10 60 min rainfall process also we find an obvious increase in sc value when the slope gradient 10 fig 4b and c these results are disagreement with the results found by jomaa et al 2010 2012 2013 the reasons may be attributed to inter rill erosion being the dominant process under the gentle slope condition which could also be indirectly verified from the images in fig 3 when the slope gradient 10 the inter rill erosion process is dominant only at the beginning of the erosive events as the topsoil is saturated the erosion pathways are developed and runoff is concentrated the rill erosion process becomes the dominant one see fig 3 we estimate ω value critical stream power to distinguish soil erosion type for the experimental soils and the result shows that all ω values for the soils are less than the threshold value developed by beuselinck et al 2002 therefore in theory there is no rill erosion process during the rainfall event but visual observations support that the rill erosion is happened fig 3 the reason may be that the threshold value obtained in previous studies is not adaptive to the soils in this study beuselinck et al 2002 obtained a threshold value in the homogeneous soil while our experiments were carried out in the heterogeneous soil soils containing rock fragments further analyses indicate that the rock fragments affect slope hydrological process via changing hydraulic parameters such as reynolds number re weisbach friction coefficient f shear stress τ and stream power ω but there are complicated interactions between runoff sediment rock fragment content and slope gradient 4 3 implications of this study in most soil erosion models rock fragment cover is a parameter to represent the effect of rock fragment but it is not adaptive to the case of embedded rock fragments this study reveals that the embedded rock fragments can strongly affect slope hydrological processes such as infiltration runoff sediment and relevant hydraulic parameters depending on the embedded rock fragment content and slope gradient in this sense it should develop some proper parameters to quantify the pattern of the embedded rock fragments for improving the predictions of runoff and soil erosion in these models also our findings can provide guideline for soil and water conservation e g as using rock fragments to control soil erosion the best advantage is to make the rock fragments exposure not to embedding into the soil especially when slope gradient is higher than 5 5 conclusions the rock fragments embedded into the soil can change slope hydrological processes depending on slope gradient and the embedded rock fragment content they have weak effects on infiltration and runoff and relatively strong effects on sediment discharge and sediment concentration the soil contains high rock fragments own relatively lower steady infiltration rate both sediment discharge and soil erosion modulus significantly increase with slope gradient in this kind soil relevant hydraulic parameters can also be changed by the embedded rock fragment content the embedded rock fragments mainly affect the slope hydrological processes during the later stage of rainfall 10 60 min the change of surface roughness and the relationship between soil erosion and runoff caused by the rock fragments dominate slope hydrological processes which is intensively interacted by slope gradient our study suggests that the embedded rock fragments in the soil accelerate sediment yield and result in severe soil erosion especially under higher slope gradients acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant numbers 41371242 and

great relevance to water management in this paper the mann kendall mk test with variations accounting for lag 1 autocorrelation full autocorrelation and long term persistence was used to detect the long term flow trends in 916 of the world s largest ocean reaching rivers over the period 1948 2004 field significance was evaluated using walker s test globally the results revealed more decreases in

significant increases regionally positive streamflow trends mainly occurred in high latitude areas and negative streamflow trends mainly occurred in low latitude areas a pattern that can be attributed to uneven precipitation and the effects of global warming when the full autocorrelation structure and long term persistence behavior were taken into account in the trend analysis there was a large reduction in the number of rivers with significant changes in streamflow negligible departures from the traditional mk results were observed when only the lag 1 autocorrelation was taken into

united states wang and hejazi 2011 hidalgo et al 2009 and at the continental scale such as europe berghuijs et al 2016 bierkens and van beek 2009 north america fritze et al 2011 hodgkins and dudley 2006 and south america marengo 1995 pasquini and depetris 2007 despite a relative paucity of data global analyses of freshwater discharge have attracted attention because of the ability to reveal aspects of the hydrological cycle at a larger scale using data of varying duration 4 182 years from 221 rivers and a statistical wavelet method labat et al 2004 detected a consistent correlation between global annual temperature and streamflow reporting a 4 increase in global streamflow for every 1 c rise in global temperature over the twentieth century however this result was disputed by legates et al 2005 peel and mcmahon 2006 and dai et al 2009 on the basis of inadequate streamflow data and inclusion of anthropogenic changes biemans et al 2011 döll et al 2009 the majority of recent comprehensive analyses do not show a significant trend in global streamflow in the late twentieth century dai 2016 alkama et al 2013 alkama et al 2011 dai et al 2009 milliman et al 2008 dai 2016 found that only 55 27 5 29 negative vs 26 positive of the world s largest 200 rivers showed statistically significant streamflow trends over the period 1948 2012 dai 2016 showed that continental streamflow decreased slightly from 1949 to 1993 and then recovered to slightly above the 1950 1980 mean according to milliman et al 2008 cumulative annual discharge from 137 representative rivers to global oceans remained constant although the annual discharge from about one third of these rivers changed by more than 30 alkama et al 2013 detected no significant changes in observed streamflow from 1958 to 1992 or in the reconstructed streamflow from 1992 to 2004 for a set of 161 rivers which confirmed the previous results from dai et al 2009 and alkama et al 2011 conversely alkama et al 2013 found a significant change in reconstructed streamflow when they analyzed a larger area consisting of 687 rivers the results from alkama et al 2013 suggest that changes in global streamflow remain unresolved and are sensitive to the duration of the streamflow data majority of previous studies on trends in streamflow used the original mann kendall mk test which assumes there are no serial correlations in the data however in many situations hydrological data are autocorrelated leading to disproportionate false rejection of the null hypothesis no trend hamed and rao 1998 yue et al 2002a b hamed 2008 similarly the long term persistence ltp can lead to underestimation of serial correlation and overestimation of the significance of trends koutsoyiannis 2003 hamed 2008 to examine the influence of autocorrelation and ltp we performed four analyses using four different mann kendall mk tests i the original mann kendall test ii the mann kendall test with lag 1 autocorrelation and trend free pre whitening iii a mann kendall test that takes significant autocorrelation structure into account and iv a mann kendall test that uses the hurst coefficient to take ltp into account the theil sen estimator a non parametric approach is also used to estimate the slope of the trend line the hydrological cycle is intertwined with atmospheric and oceanic circulation and energy cycles david 2010 trenberth et al 2007 the oceans and the atmosphere have large heat capacity and act as essential moisture sources for the climate system oceans also act as a form of long term memory within the climate system sun et al 2016 continental streamflow is one of the main components of the hydrological cycle and is influenced by complex ocean atmosphere interactions intra annual inter annual and decadal changes in ocean atmosphere interactions affect the pattern of floods and droughts and transform the hydrology in affected regions nijssen et al 2001 indices describing coherent patterns of large scale ocean atmosphere oscillations such as the arctic oscillation ao the north atlantic oscillation nao the southern oscillation index soi niño 3 4 pacific mean sea surface temperature and the pacific decadal oscillation pdo act as convenient and relatively effective predictors of streamflow variability fleming and dahlke 2014 many studies have examined the effects of these climate oscillations on river flow worldwide for example chiew and mcmahon 2002 report clear el niño southern oscillation enso streamflow teleconnections in many catchments using an analysis based on two enso indicators the soi and the multivariate enso index mei david 2010 used a cross wavelet analysis to detect the relationships between estimated annual continental freshwater discharge and selected climate indices nao ao soi pdo and niño 3 4 over the period 1876 1994 the relationships were temporally non stationary with three main bands of variability at 2 10 years 10 20 years and 20 30 years milliman and farnsworth 2013 provide a brilliant summary of the climatic signals that drive global precipitation and river discharge they found a close correlation between global precipitation and the enso signal and between northern hemispheric precipitation and runoff and the nao ao wanders and wada 2015 show that strong correlations exist over a 100 year period between the nao ao or pdo and both modeled and observed global discharge anomalies however such estimates include a large degree of uncertainty because of the scarcity and heterogeneity of global datasets leaving open the question of long term changes in continental discharge alkama et al 2011 peel and mcmahon 2006 establishing more comprehensive datasets would be conducive to more accurate results to the best of our knowledge the most comprehensive downstream dataset to date is that developed by dai et al 2009 consisting of filled monthly streamflow at the farthest downstream station for the world s 925 largest ocean reaching rivers alkama et al 2011 using the latest global streamflow dataset developed by dai et al 2009 we detect the trends in continental streamflow using four versions of the mk test we then summarize the discharge from individual continents and the discharge into different ocean basins we also investigate the causal relationships between continental streamflow and ocean signals ao nao soi niño3 4 and pdo our conclusions have important implications for planning and operational strategies concerning the sustainable use of available water resources 2 data 2 1 streamflow data dai et al 2009 constructed a global river dataset containing data from the world s 925 largest ocean reaching rivers these rivers cover 80 106 km2 which is 80 of the total global ocean draining land area and accounts for 73 of total global streamflow dai et al 2009 this study focuses on constructed global streamflow at annual and monthly temporal scales despite the efforts of dai 2016 to update the streamflow data for 57 large rivers all the way to 2012 about 800 streamflow series end by 2004 therefore we focus on the period 1948 2004 in total we used 916 constructed annual streamflow series and 818 constructed monthly streamflow series in this study fig 1 shows the distribution of the gauge stations included in this study studies of global streamflow depend heavily on the accuracy of the data used because unreliable or faulty datasets induce large uncertainties in the results the records for most of the large rivers in the world are reasonably complete between 1948 and 2004 in the global hydrology dataset compiled by dai et al 2009 data gaps in the records were filled with nearby station data that was usually highly correlated correlation coefficient r 0 9 or with values derived from model simulations and regression streamflow from unmonitored areas was estimated via simulations with the community land model version 3 clm3 forced by observation based meteorological data that were significantly and often strongly correlated with the observed streamflow for most rivers according to dai et al 2009 statistically significant correlations exist between observed and clm3 simulated streamflow for most of the world s largest rivers correlation coefficient r 0 5 0 9 qian et al 2006 confirmed that it is possible to reproduce much of the variation in historical streamflow records for many of the world s major rivers using clm3 forced by observation based atmospheric data dai et al 2009 also emphasized that instead of using the clm3 simulated flow directly to fill the data gaps they used linear regression for each river with simulated flow as the input to estimate the flow for years without observations thus mean biases and the incongruity in the magnitude of variations in the clm3 simulated flow are taken into consideration and have little effect on the constructed flow the clm3 based infilling accounts for independent meteorological observations and thus is superior to pure statistical infilling the dataset has high homogeneity and is the most comprehensive downstream discharge dataset in existence alkama et al 2013 and has therefore been used in a large number of studies using the streamflow dataset and coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 experiments alkama et al 2013 evaluated the possible changes in recent and future streamflow with a temporal optimal detection tod statistical test fleming and dahlke 2014 applied akaike information criterion based polynomial selection to observational datasets compiled by dai and trenberth 2002 and dai et al 2009 to investigate annual flow volume teleconnections for 42 of the northern hemisphere s largest ocean reaching rivers gedney et al 2014 used the dai et al 2009 dataset to quantify the historical effect of aerosol concentrations which influence the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth on observed river flow in the heavily industrialized northern extra tropics iles and hegerl 2015 used the dataset to analyze the systematic changes in global patterns of streamflow after volcanic eruptions zhou et al 2012 used the observed mean annual streamflow between 1986 and 1995 for 150 large basins from the dai et al 2009 dataset to evaluate the performance of 14 global land surface models and six budyko type hydrological models despite the comprehensive nature and popularity of the dataset we tested its accuracy prior to conducting our study we compared the 1948 2004 mean annual streamflow km3 year from observational and constructed data at the farthest downstream station for 18 large rivers fig 2 the constructed streamflow from dai et al 2009 is significantly correlated with the observations at both inter annual and multi decadal time scales with correlation coefficients generally exceeding 0 95 the observed streamflow data in fig 2 come from the china water resources bureau http www hydroinfo gov cn the government of canada https www canada ca en services environment html and the u s geological survey https waterdata usgs gov nwis sw respectively a further check revealed a few incomplete records in several rivers we removed streamflow

original mann kendall mk statistical test mann 1945 kendall 1975 which is distribution free and insensitive to outliers in the data is a nonparametric rank based statistical test that is widely used for identification of trends in hydrological time series serrano et al 1999 yue et al 2002a b hamed 2008 kumar et al 2009 sagarika et al 2014 restrepo et al 2014 for a series x 1 x 2 x 3 x n the mk test statistic s is given by 1 s i 1 n 1 i 1 n sgn x j x i where 2 sgn x 1 for x 0 0 for x 0 1 for x 0 assuming the data is serially independent and identically distributed 3 e s 0 4 var s n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 n t i i i 1 2 i 5 18 where e s is the mean var s is the variance of s and t i is the number of ties of extent i the mk standardized test statistic z is given by 5 z s 1 v s for s 0 0 for s 0 s 1 v s for s 0 a positive s indicates an increasing trend and vice versa the test statistic z gives the significance level for rejecting the null hypothesis the magnitude of trends is determined by the theil sen approach tsa sen 1968 thiel 1950 the tsa slope β is given by 6 β median x j x i j i for all i j 3 1 2 mann kendall test with trend free pre whitening mk2 mk1 assumes the input data are serially independent which is not true for many hydrological time series fathian et al 2016 it is documented that the presence of positive negative autocorrelation would overestimate underestimate the significance of both positive and negative trends if such autocorrelation is not taken into account hamed and rao 1998 yue et al 2002a b hamed 2008 to overcome this we use mann kendall after trend free pre whitening mk2 yue et al 2002a b and the modified mann kendall test mk3 hamed and rao 1998 in this study mk2 removes only lag 1 autocorrelation the trend free pre whitening tfpw procedure is as below yue et al 2002a b compute the lag one k 1 autocorrelation coefficient r 1 using 7 r k 1 n k i 1 n k x i x x i k x 1 n i 1 n x i x 2 if 1 1 96 n 2 n 2 r 1 1 1 96 n 2 n 2 then the time series is serially independent at the 5 significance level and no pre whitening is required otherwise the time series is considered to be serially correlated and pre whitening is necessary before performing the mk test remove the trend from the series using eq 8 to obtain a detrended series the non parametric tsa slope β in the time series is computed via eq 6 8 x i x i β i compute the lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient r 1 of the detrended series x i and then remove the lag one autoregressive component ar 1 from the detrended series to get a residual series y i 9 y i x i r 1 x i 1 the trend β i is added back to the residual series to get a blended series 10 y i y i β i the mann kendall test is applied to the blended series y i to determine the significance of the trend 3 1 3 modified mann kendall test mk3 removing only the lag 1 autocorrelation is not enough for many hydrological data it is sometimes necessary to use the modified mk test the modified mann kendall test hamed and rao 1998 considers all the significant autocorrelation structure in a time series supposes a correlated series is composed of n data in which n are uncorrelated the modified variance v s is used for calculating the mann kendall z 11 v s v s n n 12 n n 1 2 n n 1 n 2 i 1 n 1 n i n i 1 n i 2 r i v s is calculated according to eq 4 r i is the lag i significant autocorrelation coefficient eq 7 of rank i for the time series v s is replaced by v s when computing the mann kendall z in eq 5 3 1 4 mann kendall test with long term persistence mk4 in addition to short term persistence stp as represented by lag 1 autocorrelation the presence of long term persistence ltp or the hurst phenomenon hurst 1951 can considerably influence the precision of trend detection in hydroclimatic data koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 cohn and lins 2005 in a physical sense ltp can be postulated to be the occurrence of similar climatic conditions such as wet or dry within a cluster of time koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 ignorance of significant ltp behavior in the data series leads to underestimation of serial correlation in the data structure and overestimation of the significance of the mann kendall test result koutsoyiannis 2003 to incorporate ltp we use the mann kendall test with ltp mk4 thus overall four versions of the mk test are used in this study and the results compared the mann kendall test with ltp hamed 2008 involves the following steps 1 calculation of the hurst coefficient h first the time series x i is detrended using the non parametric tsa slope eq 6 and the detrended series x i is obtained using eq 8 second the equivalent normal variates of rank of the detrended series are obtained using eq 13 13 z i ϕ 1 r i n 1 where r i is the rank of the detrended series x i n is the length of the time series and ϕ 1 is the inverse standard normal distribution function mean 0 standard deviation 1 third the correlation matrix for a given hurst coefficient is given by 14 c n h ρ j i for i 1 n j 1 n 15 ρ l 1 2 l 1 2 h 2 l 2 h l 1 2 h for l 1 where ρ l is the autocorrelation function of lag l for a given h and is independent of the time scale of aggregation for the time series koutsoyiannis 2003 the value of h is obtained by maximizing the log likelihood function of h as given by eq 16 16 log l h 1 2 log c n h z t c n h 1 z 2 γ 0 where c n h is the determinant of correlation matrix c n h z t is the transpose vector of equivalent normal variates z eq 13 c n h 1 is the inverse matrix and γ 0 is the variance of z i 2 determination of the significance of h the 5 significance level for h is determined using the mean μ h and standard deviation σ h from the following equations 17 μ h 0 5 2 87 n 0 9067 18 σ h 0 77654 n 0 5 0 0062 3 calculation of variance if h is found to be significant the variance of s is calculated using eq 19 for a given h 19 v s h i j k l 2 π sin 1 ρ j i ρ i l ρ j k ρ i k 2 2 ρ j i 2 2 ρ k l where ρ l is calculated from eq 15 for a given h the variance is corrected for bias in eq 20 by multiplying with a factor b where b is a function of h and n given in the appendix hamed 2008 the significance of the mann kendall test is computed by using v s h in place of v s in eq 5 20 v s h v s h b 3 2 walker s test in addition to accounting for serial correlation at individual stations we determined the effect of spatial correlation among stations for each continent field significance using walker s test as suggested by wilks 2006 field significance was evaluated to assess whether the results for each continent were globally significant sagarika et al 2014 in this study walker s test wilks 2006 considers the p values of the stations derived from the four kinds of mk results at the 5 significance level the test considers the p value of each of the significance tests let p 1 be the smallest of the k local p values to reject the global null hypothesis that all k local null hypotheses are true i e to declare field significance p 1 must be no larger than a critical value p walker corresponding to the global test level α global in this study α global 0 05 according to wilks 2006 21 p walker 1 1 α global 1 k 3 3 granger causality test we used the granger causality test gct to investigate the impact of the climate indices ao nao niño 3 4 soi and pdo on continental discharge this test first originated in econometrics granger 1969 and has x since been extended to many other research fields including the study of climate systems sun et al 2016 for example attanasio 2012 analyzed the granger causality of natural and anthropogenic forcings on global temperature anomalies similarly mokhov and smirnov 2008 used the gct to quantify the influence of solar activity on the earth s global surface temperature the test is designed to detect the existence of a potential causal relationship between variables the granger notion of causality is as follows a variable is granger causal for another variable y if knowledge of the past history of x is useful for explaining the future state of y over and above knowledge of the past history of y itself so if the prediction of y is significantly improved by including x as a predictor then x is said to be a granger cause for y granger 1969 the test procedure is as follows 1 stationarity is a requirement for the gct hence we used the augmented dickey fuller test adf dickey and fuller 1981 a popular unit root test to check for stationarity the results show that the ao nao niño 3 4 soi and pdo indices were all stationary during the period 1948 2004 2 the gct computes the variance rate of two time series y river flow and x ocean signals to test the null hypothesis that x does not granger cause y the proper lagged values of y t after autoregression are expressed as 22 y t j 1 m 1 r y j y t j ε y t the contribution of x to the regression of y is expressed as 23 y t j 1 m 1 a y j y t j i 1 m 2 b x i x t i ε y x t where t is the length of the time series a b and r are the correlation weights and ε is the prediction error because gct results are susceptible to lag length the bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 was used to calculate the optimal lags twelve bic results were calculated for 1 12 lag months eq 22 the optimal lag order was determined on the basis of the smallest bic 24 bic s t ln rss r t s 1 ln t 25 rss r s t 1 t ε y t 2 26 bic s t ln rss u t s 1 ln t 27 rss u s t 1 t ε y x t 2 where s is the lag order from 1 to 12 rss r and rss u are the sum of squared residuals for eqs 1 and 2 respectively the lag length with the smallest bic in eq 1 is considered the optimal lag order m 1 for y the optimal lag order m 2 for x was similarly determined throughout the study we used a significance level of p 0 05 to assess whether the results were statistically significant if the p values calculated by the f test are lower than 0 05 x is considered to have granger caused y 28 f y x rss r rss u m 2 rss u t m 1 m 2 1 4 results 4 1 global streamflow trends the trends in river flow for 916 global rivers were analyzed using four versions of the mann kendall trend test described above streamflow trends were evaluated for the annual water year from october to september of the following year because snowfall from the previous winter mostly occurring in the northern hemisphere contributes to streamflow in the following spring dai et al 2009 the spatial distribution of the stations and the results from the four mk tests are presented in fig 3 table 1 summarizes the number and average tsa slope of the stations with significant trends at the 5 significance level out of the total 916 rivers rivers with downward streamflow trends 503 54 9 slightly outnumbered rivers with upward trends 408 44 5 however only a small proportion of rivers had significant trends α 0 05 rivers with a significant downward trend 120 13 1 outnumbered rivers with significant upward trend 51 5 6 we did not detect a significant universal trend the spatial distribution of river trends is noteworthy streamflow is increasing at high latitudes including northern europe northern north america and northern asia increases in streamflow also occurred for rivers in southern south america southern north america madagascar and northern oceania most of which lie about 20 40 north or 20 40 south of the equator decreases in streamflow however occurred in low and mid latitude basins including central north america northern south america africa southern asia northern europe and western oceania the mk1 and mk2 tests produced similar results fig 3 table 1 however there was a clear reduction in the number of rivers with significant changes in streamflow when the full autocorrelation structure mk3 and ltp behavior mk4 were taken into account fig 3 table 1 with the mk3 test 37 rivers had an upward trend and 83 rivers had a downward trend for mk4 the numbers were 34 and 75 respectively the reduction in the number of rivers with significant trends was more pronounced for south america and africa than for other continents there was a 52 reduction in the number of significant trends from 29 for mk1 to 14 for mk4 for south america and a 42 reduction from 31 for mk1 to 18 for mk4 for africa but for north america and asia the reductions were from 26 to 19 and 39 to 28 respectively in general europe had the smallest percentage of rivers with significant trends about 10 rivers and similar number of rivers with upward and downward trends other continents had more rivers with downward trends than upward trends almost no african rivers showed a significant upward trend in streamflow only one river in the mk2 analysis the average trend strengths as expressed by the tsa slope eq 6 for stations with significant trends are shown in table 1 the average tsa slope for upward trends was highest in asia and south america and lowest in oceania and europe the average tsa slope for downward trends was highest in africa and lowest in oceania in general the average global tsa slope showed a 15 30 9 07 mcm year increase with mk1 mk4 and an 11 82 7 16 mcm year decrease with mk1 mk4 table 1 also shows the field significance results as determined by walker s test when we used mk1 and mk2 all continents were field significant when we used mk3 all continents except south america were field significant however when we used mk4 there was no field significance 4 2 the effects of lag 1 autocorrelation and long term persistence table 2 summarizes the results of lag 1 autocorrelation and ltp out of 916 rivers 267 rivers showed lag 1 autocorrelation and 259 showed ltp at p 0 05 a total of 203 rivers showed both lag 1 autocorrelation and ltp south america and asia had a higher number of stations with ltp than lag 1 autocorrelation africa had the highest persistence with 42 2 of stations showing lag 1 autocorrelation and 32 5 of stations showing ltp the stations with significant correlation at p 0 05 in lag 1 autocorrelation and ltp were tested for trends table 2 out of the 267 rivers showing significant lag 1 autocorrelation 93 rivers showed had trends that were significant with the mk2 test eight out of 259 rivers with significant ltp had trends that were significant with the mk4 test however 70 of these 259 rivers had trends that were significant with the mk1 test in which ltp was not taken into consideration 4 3 river flow integrated by continent and by ocean next we examined the annual water year river flow time series integrated for each continent fig 4 and for individual oceans and seas fig 5 the americas and europe had slight upward trends in annual river flow whereas the other continents had downward trends africa 6 72 km3 year had the most prominent downward trend followed by asia 4 32 km3 year whereas south america 1 57 km3 year had the most significant upward trend except for the arctic ocean 3 13 km3 year river flow into individual oceans and seas decreased among all the oceans the pacific ocean 6 26 km3 year had the most significant downward trend 4 4 granger causality test the ao refers to an opposing pattern of pressure between the arctic and the northern middle latitudes deser 2000 fig 6 a shows that the granger causality of the ao for monthly freshwater discharge was significant in south america southern north america and large parts of europe and southeastern asia accounting for about 30 of rivers in europe south america and asia overall 29 26 of all the 8 1 8 rivers included in this study were influenced by the ao the nao is a large scale alternation of atmospheric mass with centers of action near the icelandic low and the azores high dickson et al 2000 the regional distribution of rivers with a significant granger causal relationship between the nao and river flow resembles that for the ao but with a slightly lower number reaching significance fig 6b the soi and niño 3 4 are representative indices for the enso fig 6c and d show clear statistically significant granger causality between the soi niño 3 4 and streamflow in southern north america large portions of south america parts of europe and southern asia as well as in eastern oceania and southeastern and northwestern africa overall 36 57 of rivers were granger influenced by the soi and 38 43 by niño 3 4 the pdo had a granger causal effect on the variation in streamflow over southern north america parts of europe southern asia eastern oceania and south america fig 6e on the whole 25 55 of the 818 rivers included in this study were granger influenced by the pdo table 3 shows the percentage of rivers with significant granger causality between river flow and ocean signals broken down by region the optimal lag order for all indices was one month for most rivers with significant granger casual relationships 86 for ao 88 for nao 86 for soi 90 for niño 3 4 91 for pdo streamflow appeared to be predictable with a lead time of at least one month there were some exceptions for example the lag order for the ao was two months in some rivers in southern north america eastern south america and eastern europe the ao also led streamflow by about three to five months in northwestern europe some rivers in western europe were predicable by the nao over approximately two to five months the soi led streamflow in eastern south america by two months and both the soi and niño 3 4 led southeastern africa and northeastern oceania by three months the lag order for the pdo in some parts of southwestern north america was two months it should be noted that the lag orders presented in this paper indicated the lag order that produced the most significant relationship between climate indices and streamflow which does not necessarily preclude the existence of relationships at other lag times gershunov and cayan 2003 fig 7 summarizes the global distribution of the major discharge drivers for each river as determined by the granger causal relationships between ocean signals and streamflow it is clear that the enso the soi and niño 3 4 is the predominant driver of streamflow in the tropics and the subtropics the impact of the enso also extends into northern asia and northern north america the pdo is the major driver for a small number of rivers located mainly in the tropics and the subtropics the ao and nao play a prominent role in streamflow in europe as well as parts of southeastern north america southeastern south america and southern asia however for some rivers we did not detect any granger causality between streamflow and the five ocean signals used in this paper these rivers lacking significant granger drivers are mainly located at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere and also in parts of southern north america western africa and southeastern asia 5 discussion at the global scale we detected no significant overall trend in agreement with milliman et al 2008 dai et al 2009 and alkama et al 2011 the average tsa slope showed different trend patterns for different continents complex factors contribute to the discrepant global streamflow trends although global warming is expected to intensify the hydrological cycle according to the clausius clapeyron relationship wu et al 2013 miao et al 2016a b uncertainty remains milliman et al 2008 restrepo et al 2014 in fact the increase in aerosol emissions since the mid twentieth century counteract greenhouse gas driven warming and act to suppress the hydrological cycle by producing a surface energy deficit wu et al 2013 changes in streamflow are generally dominated by precipitation variability alkama et al 2011 gerten et al 2008 mccabe and wolock 2011 however although global average precipitation increases with climate change a large portion of this increase occurs over oceans with continents experiencing regionally heterogeneous trends arnell 1999 piao et al 2007 the oceans which comprise 71 of global surface area are estimated to receive over 80 of global rainfall durack et al 2012 it is also noteworthy that increased temperature results in a reduction in streamflow efficiency i e the fraction of annual precipitation that becomes streamflow due to increased evapotranspiration mccabe and wolock 2011 therefore despite prominent regional trends no significant trends in streamflow have been observed at the global scale at the regional scale the increases in streamflow were primarily found in high latitude areas and the decreases in streamflow were primarily found in low and mid latitude areas this regional trend pattern is consistent with the streamflow trends reported in previous studies gerten et al 2008 milliman et al 2008 nijssen et al 2001 piao et al 2007 according to dai et al 2009 precipitation decreased over many low and mid latitude areas accounting for the decline in streamflow over the period 1948 2004 nijssen et al 2001 suggest that most of the increased precipitation predicted by general circulation models gcms occurs during the winter at high latitudes the increased winter precipitation is stored as snow and then contributes to increased streamflow during the following snow melt period in contrast precipitation and evapotranspiration are largely in phase at low and middle latitude areas meanwhile as global temperatures have increased storm tracks have moved poleward resulting in a shift in precipitation and thus streamflow toward higher latitudes mccabe and wolock 2011 there has been an approximately 4 increase in annual precipitation for the circumpolar region north of 50 n over the past 50 years groisman et al 2005 furthermore surface warming at high latitudes has caused a degradation of the permafrost which may also contribute to increases in streamflow at these latitudes alkama et al 2011 our comparative study of four different mk techniques shows that there are strong autocorrelations and significant long term changes in streamflow globally it is evident that the trends reported are strongly affected by these factors there was a clear reduction in the number of rivers with significant streamflow trends when the full autocorrelation structure mk3 and ltp behavior mk4 were considered in the analysis from 171 rivers with mk1 to 120 with mk3 and 109 with mk4 statistically autocorrelation can cause spurious empirical significance levels for the mk1 test compared with the nominal significance levels which may lead to the hypothesis test being less sensitive the empirical significance levels for mk3 are much closer to the correct nominal significance levels hamed and rao 1998 when we analyzed the streamflow trends of 259 rivers with significant ltp we found a large reduction in the number of rivers with significant trends decreasing from 70 with mk1 ltp not taken into account to eight with mk4 ltp taken into account the results are consistent with previous findings that trend tests that do not take ltp into account greatly overstate the statistical significance of the observed trends and that taking ltp into account leads to a reduction in the number of significant trends detected when ltp is present koutsoyiannis 2003 cohn and lins 2005 koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 khaliq et al 2008 sagarika et al 2014 natural variability such as solar forcing and volcanic activity and anthropogenic local factors are cited as some of the possible reasons for ltp behavior in the data series koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 kumar et al 2009 in addition to the large changes seen when taking ltp into account we observed smaller negligible departures when we took only lag 1 autocorrelation into consideration thus the mk2 analysis method is not sufficient to remove all significant serial correlations in the data series kumar et al 2009 sagarika et al 2014 overall using four mk tests helped to differentiate the trends that existed under the assumption of serial independence the gc test showed strong causal links between climatic indices ao nao soi niño 3 4 pdo and global continental discharge the most prominent causal relationships were those between the enso signals the soi and niño 3 4 and streamflow which were statistically significant for 36 57 soi and 38 43 niño 3 4 of the rivers in this study with significant causality located mainly in southern north america large portions of south america parts of europe southern asia eastern oceania and southeastern and northwestern africa similar evident correlations between the enso and streamflow have been identified in previous studies chiew and mcmahon 2002 milliman and farnsworth 2013 restrepo et al 2014 the strong teleconnection may arise from the influence of the enso on global precipitation during enso events large precipitation anomalies in the tropics are induced by the re arrangement of walker circulation convection centers over the pacific indian and atlantic oceans the associated changes in the monsoon systems via the hadley cell and their interactions with mid latitude westerlies generate coherent anomaly patterns over the extra tropics dai and wigley 2000 granger causality between the ao nao and freshwater discharge is significant in about 27 51 25 93 of the 818 rivers we studied with significant causality located mainly in large parts of europe south america southern north america and southeastern asia these results are consistent with bierkens and van beek 2009 david 2010 dickson et al 2000 and labat 2006 because of the dominance of the atlantic arctic sector on the ao the nao and the ao are nearly indistinguishable in the time domain and have an analogous influence on wind heat flux evaporation precipitation etc dickson et al 2000 the nao and the ao are both changes in pressure systems and mainly have effects on precipitation via the enhancement or diminishment of moisture advection in the northern hemisphere in winter antico et al 2014 david 2010 therefore the ao and the nao are strongly correlated with winter discharge anomalies the pdo was granger causal for the variation in streamflow in 25 55 of 818 rivers studied with significant effects generally located in southern north america parts of europe southern asia eastern oceania and south america the pdo regime represents interdecadal oscillations in the north pacific climate system gobena and gan 2009 and is thought to constrain the envelope of interannual enso variability mantua et al 1997 a study by david 2010 revealed that the pdo impacts the 10 30 year discharge variability in asia europe and the americas mantua et al 1997 found that precipitation and temperature in australia are associated with the pdo they also point out that the warm phase of the pdo coincides with anomalously dry periods in parts of oceania asia and the americas the large heat capacity of the ocean allows oceanic climate signals to persist for months resulting in delayed climate responses our gc results showed that one month was the most prominent lag time in other words climate signals from the previous month significantly influenced global streamflow the global distribution of major ocean signal drivers of river flow is mostly similar to that found by milliman and farnsworth 2013 the main difference is that milliman and farnsworth 2013 found that rivers in northern north america and northern asia were largely controlled by the nao ao whereas we tended to find a lack of granger causality between streamflow and ocean signals in these rivers this difference might arise from the differences in methods and data length in the two studies furthermore milliman and farnsworth 2013 identified the primary drivers for precipitation and river discharge whereas we focused on the drivers for streamflow given the strong causal links between ocean signals and global streamflow it would be helpful to assess the degree to which global streamflow can potentially be predicted by oceanic forcing investigating the extent of predictability of global streamflow by oceanic forcing was not an objective of this study but we plan to extend this study in the future by addressing this issue the potential predictability can be thought of as an upper bound on forecast skill or the partitioning of a time series into a predictable low frequency oceanic signal and unpredictable dynamical noise westra and sharma 2010 short gianotti et al 2014 previous studies have mainly focused on the potential predictability of precipitation or temperature using signal to noise ratios kang and shukla 2006 ehsan et al 2013 variance partitioning jia and delsole 2011 saha et al 2016 information based metrics tang et al 2014 saha et al 2016 or linear regression models westra and sharma 2010 etc these previous studies revealed a strong predictability of precipitation by sst in enso regions kang et al 2004 westra and sharma 2010 saha et al 2016 consistent with our result that enso signals predominate in the tropics and subtropics it cannot be assumed however that atmospheric teleconnections are associated with a particular climate mode for example the enso and pdo signals reinforce each other when they are in phase intensifying the climate anomalies over the affected regions gershunov and barnett 1998 furthermore streamflow represents the spatiotemporal integration of all upstream dynamics including human intervention a synthesis by meybeck et al 2004 suggested that direct global anthropogenic effects on the terrestrial water cycle were likely to surpass those of climate change at least at the decadal scale a simulation by piao et al 2007 showed that land use changes mainly deforestation accounted for 50 of the reconstructed global streamflow trends over the last century the transformation of forests to croplands leads to shorter growing periods lower rooting depths and lower interception losses gerten et al 2008 and has resulted in a marked increase in streamflow over the last century piao et al 2007 in asia and south america the expansion of agricultural land may have contributed to an increase in regional discharge similarly the contraction of agricultural land in europe may have contributed to a decrease in regional discharge fig 8 however irrigation accounts for about 70 of global water withdrawals and nearly 90 of consumptive water use cai and rosegrant 2002 shiklomanov and rodda 2003 and diverts about 4 5 of annual global streamflow to evapotranspiration milly and dunne 1994 long term mean global discharge into oceans has decreased by 2 7 because of water withdrawals döll et al 2009 therefore the increase in irrigated agricultural land in asia europe and north america may account for the decreases in regional streamflow in these areas fig 9 population size is regarded as a driving force in the demand for water and has increased rapidly in many areas especially in asia and africa inevitably contributing to the decreases in streamflow fig 10 in order to meet the needs of the expanding population the construction of large dams boomed during the second half of the twentieth century fig 11 reservoirs contribute significantly to the irrigation water supply in many regions including the colorado river and columbia river basins in the united states and several large river basins in india china and central asia biemans et al 2011 reservoirs lead to increased evaporation and changes in the seasonality of river flow but do not necessarily cause much change in the mean annual streamflow haddeland et al 2014 over the long term the average global discharge into oceans and inland sinks has decreased by 0 8 because of dams döll et al 2009 reservoirs appear to be a major factor only for arid to semi arid river basins milliman et al 2008 the cumulative representative maximum storage capacity of reservoirs in north america asia and europe may exert a significant effect on regional streamflow all of the influences described above when combined may account for the slight upward trends in integrated annual river flow in the americas and europe and the slight downward trends in africa asia and oceania integrated river flow into the oceans showed downward trends for all oceans except the arctic ocean consistent with a previous study by dai et al 2009 the gc test is stricter and more reliable than simple lagged correlation statistics because it ensures that any apparent climatic influence on streamflow is indeed from the climatic signal the analysis removes false positive results in which relations with lagged values are in fact the result of autocorrelation within the predicted field wang et al 2004 6 conclusions in this study we performed streamflow trend analysis on 916 global rivers over the period 1948 2004 using four different mk tests we found a greater number of decreases in streamflow than increases at the global scale no overall significant trend was found and the magnitude of trends varied for the different continents prominent regional trends exist because changes in streamflow are generally dominated by precipitation variability which is highly heterogeneous across the world increases in streamflow were predominantly seen in high latitude areas and decreases in streamflow were predominantly seen in low latitude areas this pattern can be attributed to uneven precipitation and the effects of global warming for the americas and europe annual integrated river flow showed a slight upward trend for other continents there was a slight downward trend for all oceans except for the arctic ocean integrated river flow showed a downward trend a comparative study of four mk tests showed a clear reduction in the number of rivers with significant streamflow trends when the when the full autocorrelation structure mk3 and ltp behavior mk4 were taken into account in the analysis negligible departures from the original mk test were observed when only lag 1 autocorrelation was taken into account mann kendall test with trend free pre whitening mk2 overall the use of the four different mk tests helped to differentiate the trends that exist under the assumption of serial independence the gc test found strong causal relationships between the climatic indices and global continental discharge enso signals the soi and niño 3 4 were significantly causal for over 36 of rivers in this study owing to the influence of the enso on global precipitation granger causality between the ao and river flow was significant in 29 26 of rivers and in 25 76 of rivers for the nao and river flow the effects of the ao and the nao were likely due to their influence on wind heat flux evaporation and precipitation etc the pdo had a granger causal effect on streamflow in 25 55 of rivers studied arising from the influence of the pdo on interdecadal oscillations in the north pacific climate system mantua et al 1997 streamflow was affected by the interactions between ocean signals lastly anthropogenic effects may also account for a reasonable proportion of changes in river flow in some regions these results are conducive to a better understanding of global river streamflow trends and will enable the evolution of continental river streamflow to be predicted under changing climate scenarios and changing atmospheric and oceanic conditions moreover our work has important implications for planning and operational strategies concerning the sustainable use of available water resources the lack of availability of longer streamflow records is one of the limitations in understanding trends and causal relationships between streamflow and climatic indices a limitation of our study is that the gc test tacitly assumes a linear relationship between the predictor and the response however in reality the relationship may have more complex dynamics nonlinear causal relationships between additional climate signals and continental streamflow may be investigated in future work acknowledgments this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 41622101 the national key research and

7178,continental flow plays a significant role in the global ecosystem with increased global warming and a booming economy exacerbating water scarcity global analyses of continental discharge are of great relevance to water management in this paper the mann kendall mk test with variations accounting for lag 1 autocorrelation full autocorrelation and long term persistence was used to detect the long term flow trends in 916 of the world s largest ocean reaching rivers over the period 1948 2004 field significance was evaluated using walker s test globally the results revealed more decreases in streamflow than increases with the traditional mk test 503 rivers had decreased streamflow with 120 showing significant decreases whereas 408 rivers had increased streamflow with 51 showing significant increases regionally positive streamflow trends mainly occurred in high latitude areas and negative streamflow trends mainly occurred in low latitude areas a pattern that can be attributed to uneven precipitation and the effects of global warming when the full autocorrelation structure and long term persistence behavior were taken into account in the trend analysis there was a large reduction in the number of rivers with significant changes in streamflow negligible departures from the traditional mk results were observed when only the lag 1 autocorrelation was taken into consideration for the americas and europe annual integrated river flow showed a slight upward trend for other continents there was a slight downward trend for all oceans except the arctic ocean integrated river flow had a downward trend we investigated the causal relationships between streamflow and ocean signals using the granger causality test el niño southern oscillation enso signals were significantly causal for river flow in over 36 of global rivers tested the influence of the arctic oscillation ao and the north atlantic oscillation nao was significant in more than a quarter of rivers studied the pacific decadal oscillation pdo was responsible for the variation in streamflow for over a quarter of rivers studied streamflow was affected by the interactions between ocean signals as well as by anthropogenic activities keywords global river long term trend granger causality test ocean signals 1 introduction rivers supply water for municipal agricultural and economic uses clark et al 2015 they support ecosystems and strongly regulate local productivity vörösmarty et al 2004 river flow is influenced by energy exchange and biogeochemical processes and is affected by climatic fluctuations and anthropogenic activities vörösmarty et al 2004 munier et al 2012 restrepo et al 2014 kong et al 2015 miao et al 2016a b river flow into the oceans is an aggregate measure of all the fresh water leaving the landmass and is highly representative of the amount of fresh water on land with increased global warming and economic development water scarcity will worsen oki et al 2004 thus there is a need to understand the variations and long term trends in continental discharge over time to improve planning and operational strategies for the sustainable use of available water resources sagarika et al 2014 dai 2016 wu et al 2017 a good deal of research on streamflow has been carried out in individual rivers such as the amazon river coe et al 2009 labat et al 2005 the yellow river miao et al 2010 yang et al 2004 and the yangtze river zhang et al 2009 2007 at the country scale such as canada tan and gan 2015 huziy et al 2013 china zhang et al 2011 piao et al 2010 and the united states wang and hejazi 2011 hidalgo et al 2009 and at the continental scale such as europe berghuijs et al 2016 bierkens and van beek 2009 north america fritze et al 2011 hodgkins and dudley 2006 and south america marengo 1995 pasquini and depetris 2007 despite a relative paucity of data global analyses of freshwater discharge have attracted attention because of the ability to reveal aspects of the hydrological cycle at a larger scale using data of varying duration 4 182 years from 221 rivers and a statistical wavelet method labat et al 2004 detected a consistent correlation between global annual temperature and streamflow reporting a 4 increase in global streamflow for every 1 c rise in global temperature over the twentieth century however this result was disputed by legates et al 2005 peel and mcmahon 2006 and dai et al 2009 on the basis of inadequate streamflow data and inclusion of anthropogenic changes biemans et al 2011 döll et al 2009 the majority of recent comprehensive analyses do not show a significant trend in global streamflow in the late twentieth century dai 2016 alkama et al 2013 alkama et al 2011 dai et al 2009 milliman et al 2008 dai 2016 found that only 55 27 5 29 negative vs 26 positive of the world s largest 200 rivers showed statistically significant streamflow trends over the period 1948 2012 dai 2016 showed that continental streamflow decreased slightly from 1949 to 1993 and then recovered to slightly above the 1950 1980 mean according to milliman et al 2008 cumulative annual discharge from 137 representative rivers to global oceans remained constant although the annual discharge from about one third of these rivers changed by more than 30 alkama et al 2013 detected no significant changes in observed streamflow from 1958 to 1992 or in the reconstructed streamflow from 1992 to 2004 for a set of 161 rivers which confirmed the previous results from dai et al 2009 and alkama et al 2011 conversely alkama et al 2013 found a significant change in reconstructed streamflow when they analyzed a larger area consisting of 687 rivers the results from alkama et al 2013 suggest that changes in global streamflow remain unresolved and are sensitive to the duration of the streamflow data majority of previous studies on trends in streamflow used the original mann kendall mk test which assumes there are no serial correlations in the data however in many situations hydrological data are autocorrelated leading to disproportionate false rejection of the null hypothesis no trend hamed and rao 1998 yue et al 2002a b hamed 2008 similarly the long term persistence ltp can lead to underestimation of serial correlation and overestimation of the significance of trends koutsoyiannis 2003 hamed 2008 to examine the influence of autocorrelation and ltp we performed four analyses using four different mann kendall mk tests i the original mann kendall test ii the mann kendall test with lag 1 autocorrelation and trend free pre whitening iii a mann kendall test that takes significant autocorrelation structure into account and iv a mann kendall test that uses the hurst coefficient to take ltp into account the theil sen estimator a non parametric approach is also used to estimate the slope of the trend line the hydrological cycle is intertwined with atmospheric and oceanic circulation and energy cycles david 2010 trenberth et al 2007 the oceans and the atmosphere have large heat capacity and act as essential moisture sources for the climate system oceans also act as a form of long term memory within the climate system sun et al 2016 continental streamflow is one of the main components of the hydrological cycle and is influenced by complex ocean atmosphere interactions intra annual inter annual and decadal changes in ocean atmosphere interactions affect the pattern of floods and droughts and transform the hydrology in affected regions nijssen et al 2001 indices describing coherent patterns of

indicators the soi and the multivariate enso index mei david 2010 used a cross wavelet analysis to detect the relationships between estimated annual continental freshwater discharge and selected climate indices nao ao soi pdo and niño 3 4 over the period 1876 1994 the relationships were temporally non stationary with three main bands of variability at 2 10 years 10 20 years and 20 30 years milliman and farnsworth 2013 provide a brilliant summary of the climatic signals that drive global precipitation and river discharge they found a close correlation between global precipitation and the enso signal and between northern hemispheric precipitation and runoff and the nao ao wanders and wada 2015 show that strong correlations exist over a 100 year period between the nao ao or pdo and both modeled and observed global discharge anomalies however such estimates include a large degree of uncertainty because of the scarcity and heterogeneity of global datasets leaving open the question of long term changes in continental discharge alkama et al 2011 peel and mcmahon 2006 establishing more comprehensive datasets would be conducive to more accurate results to the best of our knowledge the most comprehensive downstream dataset to date is that developed by dai et al 2009 consisting of filled monthly streamflow at the farthest downstream station for the world s 925 largest ocean reaching rivers alkama et al 2011 using the latest global streamflow dataset developed by dai et al 2009 we detect the trends in continental streamflow using four versions of the mk test we then summarize the discharge from individual continents and the discharge into different ocean basins we also investigate the causal relationships between continental streamflow and ocean signals ao nao soi niño3 4 and pdo our conclusions have important implications for planning and operational strategies concerning the sustainable use of available water resources 2 data 2 1 streamflow data dai et al 2009 constructed a global river dataset containing data from the world s 925 largest ocean reaching rivers these rivers cover 80 106 km2 which is 80 of the total global ocean draining land area and accounts for 73 of total global streamflow dai et al 2009 this study focuses on constructed global streamflow at annual and monthly temporal scales despite the efforts of dai 2016 to update the streamflow data for 57 large rivers all the way to 2012 about 800 streamflow series end by 2004 therefore we focus on the period 1948 2004 in total we used 916 constructed annual streamflow series and 818 constructed monthly streamflow series in this study fig 1 shows the distribution of the gauge stations included in this study studies of global streamflow depend heavily on the accuracy of the data used because unreliable or faulty datasets induce large uncertainties in the results the records for most of the large rivers in the world are reasonably complete between 1948 and 2004 in the global hydrology dataset compiled by dai et al 2009 data gaps in the records were filled with nearby station data that was usually highly correlated correlation coefficient r 0 9 or with values derived from model simulations and regression streamflow from unmonitored areas was estimated via simulations with the community land model version 3 clm3 forced by observation based meteorological data that were significantly and often strongly correlated with the observed streamflow for most rivers according to dai et al 2009 statistically significant correlations exist between observed and clm3 simulated streamflow for most of the world s largest rivers correlation coefficient r 0 5 0 9 qian et al 2006 confirmed that it is possible to reproduce much of the variation in historical streamflow records for many of the world s major rivers using clm3 forced by observation based atmospheric data dai et al 2009 also emphasized that instead of using the clm3 simulated flow directly to fill the data gaps they used linear regression for each river with simulated flow as the input to estimate the flow for years without observations thus mean biases and the incongruity in the magnitude of variations in the clm3 simulated flow are taken into consideration and have little effect on the constructed flow the clm3 based infilling accounts for independent meteorological observations and thus is superior to pure statistical infilling the dataset has high homogeneity and is the most comprehensive downstream discharge dataset in existence alkama et al 2013 and has therefore been used in a large number of studies using the streamflow dataset and coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 experiments alkama et al 2013 evaluated the possible changes in recent and future

trenberth 2002 and dai et al 2009 to investigate annual flow volume teleconnections for 42 of the northern hemisphere s largest ocean reaching rivers gedney et al 2014 used the dai et al 2009 dataset to quantify the historical effect of aerosol concentrations which influence the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth on observed river flow in the heavily industrialized northern extra tropics iles and hegerl 2015 used the dataset to analyze the systematic changes in global patterns of streamflow after volcanic eruptions zhou et al 2012 used the observed mean annual streamflow between 1986 and 1995 for 150 large basins from the dai et al 2009 dataset to evaluate the performance of 14 global land surface models and six budyko type hydrological models despite the comprehensive nature and popularity of the dataset we tested its accuracy prior to conducting our study we compared the 1948 2004 mean annual streamflow km3 year from observational and constructed data at the farthest downstream station for 18 large rivers fig 2 the constructed streamflow from dai et al 2009 is significantly correlated with the observations at both inter annual and multi decadal time scales with correlation coefficients generally exceeding 0 95 the observed streamflow data in fig 2 come from the china water resources bureau http www hydroinfo gov cn the government of canada https www canada

original mann kendall mk statistical test mann 1945 kendall 1975 which is distribution free and insensitive to outliers in the data is a nonparametric rank based statistical test that is widely used for identification of trends in hydrological time series serrano et al 1999 yue et al 2002a b hamed 2008 kumar et al 2009 sagarika et al 2014 restrepo et al 2014 for a series x 1 x 2 x 3 x n the mk test statistic s is given by 1 s i 1 n 1 i 1 n sgn x j x i where 2 sgn x 1 for x 0 0 for x 0 1 for x 0 assuming the data is serially independent and identically distributed 3 e s 0 4 var s n n 1 2 n 5

serially independent which is not true for many hydrological time series fathian et al 2016 it is documented that the presence of positive negative autocorrelation would overestimate underestimate the significance of both positive and negative trends if such autocorrelation is not taken into account hamed and rao 1998 yue et al 2002a b hamed 2008 to overcome this we use mann kendall after trend free pre whitening mk2 yue et al 2002a b and the modified mann kendall test mk3 hamed and rao 1998 in this study mk2 removes only lag 1 autocorrelation the trend free pre whitening tfpw procedure is as below yue et al 2002a b compute the lag one k 1 autocorrelation coefficient r 1 using 7 r k 1 n k i 1 n k x i x x i k x 1 n i 1 n x i x 2 if 1 1 96 n 2 n 2 r 1 1 1 96 n 2 n 2 then the time series is serially independent at the 5 significance level and no pre whitening is required otherwise the time series is considered to be serially correlated and pre whitening is necessary before performing the mk test remove the trend from the series using eq 8 to obtain a detrended series the non parametric tsa slope β in the time series is computed via eq 6 8 x i x i β i compute the lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient r 1 of the detrended series x i and then remove the lag one autoregressive component ar 1 from the detrended series to get a residual series y i 9 y i x i r 1 x i 1 the trend β i is added back to the residual series to get a blended series 10 y i y i β i the mann kendall test is applied to the blended series y i to determine the significance of the trend 3 1 3 modified mann kendall test mk3 removing only the lag 1 autocorrelation is not enough for many hydrological data it is sometimes necessary to use the modified mk test the modified mann kendall test hamed and rao 1998 considers all the significant autocorrelation structure in a time series supposes a correlated series is composed of n data in which n are uncorrelated the modified variance v s is used for calculating the mann kendall z 11 v s v s n n 12 n n 1 2 n n 1 n 2 i 1 n 1 n i n i 1 n i 2 r i v s is calculated according to eq 4 r i is the lag i significant autocorrelation coefficient eq

represented by lag 1 autocorrelation the presence of long term persistence ltp or the hurst phenomenon hurst 1951 can considerably influence the precision of trend detection in hydroclimatic data koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 cohn and lins 2005 in a physical sense ltp can be postulated to be the occurrence of similar climatic conditions such as wet or dry within a cluster of time koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 ignorance of significant ltp behavior in the data series leads to underestimation of serial correlation in the data structure and overestimation of the significance of the mann kendall test result koutsoyiannis 2003 to incorporate ltp we use the mann kendall test with ltp mk4 thus overall four versions of the mk test are used in this study and the results compared the mann kendall test with ltp hamed 2008 involves the following steps 1 calculation of the hurst coefficient h first the time series x i is detrended using the non parametric tsa slope eq 6 and the detrended series x i is obtained using eq 8 second the equivalent normal variates of rank of the detrended series are obtained using eq 13 13 z i ϕ 1 r i n 1 where r i is the rank of the detrended series x i n is the length of the time series and ϕ 1 is the inverse standard normal distribution function mean 0 standard deviation 1 third the correlation matrix for a given hurst coefficient is given by 14 c n h ρ j i for i 1 n j 1 n 15 ρ l 1 2 l 1 2 h 2 l 2 h l 1 2 h for l 1 where ρ l is the autocorrelation function of lag l for a given h and is independent of the time scale of aggregation for the time series koutsoyiannis 2003 the value of h is obtained by maximizing the log likelihood function of h as given by eq 16 16 log l h 1 2 log c n h z t c n h 1 z 2 γ 0 where c n h is the determinant of correlation matrix c n h z t is the transpose vector of equivalent normal variates z eq 13 c n h 1 is the inverse matrix and γ 0 is the variance of z i 2 determination of the significance of h the 5 significance level for h is determined using the mean μ h and standard deviation σ h from the following equations 17 μ h 0 5 2 87 n 0 9067 18 σ h 0 77654 n 0 5 0 0062 3 calculation of variance if h is found to be significant the variance of s is calculated using eq 19 for a given h 19 v s h i j k l 2 π sin 1 ρ j i ρ i l ρ j k ρ i k 2 2 ρ j i 2 2 ρ k l where ρ l is calculated from eq 15 for a given h the variance is corrected for bias in eq 20 by multiplying with a factor b where b is a function of h and n given in the appendix hamed 2008 the significance of the mann kendall test is computed by using v s h in place of v s in eq 5 20 v s h v s h b 3 2 walker s test in addition to accounting for serial correlation at individual stations we determined the effect of spatial correlation among stations for each continent field significance using walker s test as suggested by wilks 2006 field significance was evaluated to assess whether the results for each continent were globally significant sagarika et al 2014 in this study walker s test wilks 2006 considers the p values of the stations derived from the four kinds of mk results at the 5 significance level the test considers the p value of each of the significance tests let p 1 be the smallest of the k local p values to reject the global null hypothesis that all k local null hypotheses are true i e to declare field significance p 1 must be no larger than a critical value p walker corresponding to the global test level α global in this study α global 0 05 according to wilks 2006 21 p walker 1 1 α global 1 k 3 3 granger causality test we used the granger causality test gct to investigate the impact of the climate indices ao nao niño 3 4 soi and pdo on continental discharge this test first originated in econometrics granger 1969 and has x since been extended to many other research fields including the study of climate systems sun et al 2016 for example attanasio 2012 analyzed the granger causality of natural and anthropogenic forcings on global temperature anomalies similarly mokhov and smirnov 2008 used the gct to quantify the influence of solar activity on the earth s global surface temperature the test is designed to detect the existence of a potential causal relationship between variables the granger notion of causality is as follows a variable is granger causal for another variable y if knowledge of the past history of x is useful for explaining the future state of y over and above knowledge of the past history of y itself so if the prediction of y is significantly improved by including x as a predictor then x is said to be a granger cause for y granger 1969 the test procedure is as follows 1 stationarity is a requirement for the gct hence we used the augmented dickey fuller test adf dickey and fuller 1981 a popular unit root test to check for stationarity the results show that the ao nao niño 3 4 soi and pdo indices were all stationary during the period 1948 2004 2 the gct computes the variance rate of two time series y river flow and x ocean signals to test the null hypothesis that x does not granger cause y the proper lagged values of y t after autoregression are expressed as 22 y t j 1 m 1 r y j y t j ε y t the contribution of x to the regression of y is expressed as 23 y t j 1 m 1 a y j y t j i 1 m 2 b x i x t i ε y x t where t is the length of the time series a b and r are the correlation weights and ε is the prediction error because gct results are susceptible to lag length the bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 was used to calculate the optimal lags twelve bic results were calculated for 1 12 lag months eq 22 the optimal lag order was determined on the basis of the smallest bic 24 bic s t ln rss r t s 1 ln t 25 rss r s t 1 t ε y t 2 26 bic s t ln rss u t s 1 ln t 27 rss u s t 1 t ε y x t 2 where s is the lag order from 1 to 12 rss r and rss u are the sum of squared residuals for eqs 1 and 2 respectively the lag length with the smallest bic in eq 1 is considered the optimal lag order m 1 for y the optimal lag order m 2 for x was similarly determined throughout the study we used a significance level of p 0 05 to assess whether the results were statistically significant if the p values calculated by the f test are lower than 0 05 x is considered to have granger caused y 28 f y x rss r rss u m 2 rss u t m 1 m 2 1 4 results 4 1 global streamflow trends the trends in river flow for 916 global rivers were analyzed using four versions of the mann kendall trend test described above streamflow trends were evaluated for the annual water year from october to september of the following year because snowfall from the previous winter mostly occurring in the northern hemisphere contributes to streamflow in the following spring dai et al 2009 the spatial distribution of the stations and the results from the four mk tests are presented in fig 3 table 1 summarizes the number and average tsa slope of the stations with significant trends at the 5 significance level out of the total 916 rivers rivers with downward streamflow trends 503 54 9 slightly outnumbered rivers with upward trends 408 44 5 however only a small proportion of rivers had significant trends α 0 05 rivers with a significant downward trend 120 13 1 outnumbered rivers with significant upward trend 51 5 6 we did not detect a significant universal trend the spatial distribution of river trends is noteworthy streamflow is increasing at high latitudes including northern europe northern north america and northern asia increases in streamflow also occurred for rivers in southern south america southern north america madagascar and northern oceania most of which lie about 20 40 north or 20 40 south of the equator decreases in streamflow however occurred in low and mid latitude basins including central north america northern south america africa southern asia northern europe and western oceania the mk1 and mk2 tests produced similar results fig 3 table 1 however there was a clear reduction in the number of rivers with significant changes in streamflow when the full autocorrelation structure mk3 and ltp behavior mk4 were taken into account fig 3 table 1 with the mk3 test 37 rivers had an upward trend and 83 rivers had a downward trend for mk4 the numbers were 34 and 75 respectively the reduction in the number of rivers with significant trends was more pronounced for south america and africa than for other continents there was a 52 reduction in the number of significant trends from 29 for mk1 to 14 for mk4 for south america and a 42 reduction from 31 for mk1 to 18 for mk4 for africa but for north america and asia the reductions were from 26 to 19 and 39 to 28 respectively in general europe had the smallest percentage of rivers with significant trends about 10 rivers and similar number of rivers with upward and downward trends other continents had more rivers with downward trends than upward trends almost no african rivers showed a significant upward trend in streamflow only one river in the mk2 analysis the average trend strengths as expressed by the tsa slope eq 6 for stations with significant trends are shown in table 1 the average tsa slope for upward trends was highest in asia and south america and lowest in oceania and europe the average tsa slope for downward trends was highest in africa and lowest in oceania in general the average global tsa slope showed a 15 30 9 07 mcm year increase with mk1 mk4 and an 11 82 7 16 mcm year decrease with mk1 mk4 table 1 also shows the field significance results as determined by walker s test when we used mk1 and mk2 all continents were field significant when we used mk3 all continents except south america were field significant however when we used mk4 there was no field significance 4 2 the effects of lag 1 autocorrelation and long term persistence table 2 summarizes the results of lag 1 autocorrelation and ltp out of 916 rivers 267 rivers showed lag 1 autocorrelation and 259 showed ltp at p 0 05 a total of 203 rivers showed both lag 1 autocorrelation and ltp south america and asia had a higher number of stations with ltp than lag 1 autocorrelation africa had the highest persistence with 42 2 of stations showing lag 1 autocorrelation and 32 5 of stations showing ltp the stations with significant correlation at p 0 05 in lag 1 autocorrelation and ltp were tested for trends table 2 out of the 267 rivers showing significant lag 1 autocorrelation 93 rivers showed had trends that were significant with the mk2 test eight out of 259 rivers with significant ltp had trends that were significant with the mk4 test however 70 of these 259 rivers had trends that were significant with the mk1 test in which ltp was not taken into consideration 4 3 river flow integrated by continent and by ocean next we examined the annual water year river flow time series integrated for each continent fig 4 and for individual oceans and seas fig 5 the americas and europe had slight upward trends in annual river flow whereas the other continents had downward trends africa 6 72 km3 year had the most prominent downward trend followed by asia 4 32 km3 year whereas south america 1 57 km3 year had the most significant upward trend except for the arctic ocean 3 13 km3 year river flow into individual oceans and seas decreased among all the oceans the pacific ocean 6 26 km3 year had the most significant downward trend 4 4 granger causality test the ao refers to an opposing pattern of pressure between the arctic and the northern middle latitudes deser 2000 fig 6 a shows that the granger causality of the ao for monthly freshwater discharge was significant in south america southern north america and large parts of europe and southeastern asia accounting for about 30 of rivers in europe south america and asia overall 29 26 of all the 8 1 8 rivers included in this study were influenced by the ao the nao is a large scale alternation of atmospheric mass with centers of action near the icelandic low and the azores high dickson et al 2000 the regional distribution of rivers with a significant granger causal relationship between the nao and river flow resembles that for the ao but with a slightly lower number reaching significance fig 6b the soi and niño 3 4 are representative indices for the enso fig 6c and d show clear statistically significant granger causality between the soi niño 3 4 and streamflow in southern north america large portions of south america parts of europe and southern asia as well as in eastern oceania and southeastern and northwestern africa overall 36 57 of rivers were granger influenced by the soi and 38 43 by niño 3 4 the pdo had a granger causal effect on the variation in streamflow over southern north america parts of europe southern asia eastern oceania and south america fig 6e on the whole 25 55 of the 818 rivers included in this study were granger influenced by the pdo table 3 shows the percentage of rivers with significant granger causality between river flow and ocean signals broken down by region the optimal lag order for all indices was one month for most rivers with significant granger casual relationships 86 for ao 88 for nao 86 for soi 90 for niño 3 4 91 for pdo streamflow appeared to be predictable with a lead time of at least one month there were some exceptions for example the lag order for the ao was two months in some rivers in southern north america eastern south america and eastern europe the ao also led streamflow by about three to five months in northwestern europe some rivers in western europe were predicable by the nao over approximately two to five months the soi led streamflow in eastern south america by two months and both the soi and niño 3 4 led southeastern africa and northeastern oceania by three months the lag order for the pdo in some parts of southwestern north america was two months it should be noted that the lag orders presented in this paper indicated the lag order that produced the most significant relationship between climate indices and streamflow which does not necessarily preclude the existence of relationships at other lag times gershunov and cayan 2003 fig 7 summarizes the global distribution of the major discharge drivers for each river as determined by the granger causal relationships between ocean signals and streamflow it is clear that the enso the soi and niño 3 4 is the predominant driver of streamflow in the tropics and the subtropics the impact of the enso also extends into northern asia and northern north america the pdo is the major driver for a small number of rivers located mainly in the tropics and the subtropics the ao and nao play a prominent role in streamflow in europe as well as parts of southeastern north america southeastern south america and southern asia however for some rivers we did not detect any granger causality between streamflow and the five ocean signals used in this paper these rivers lacking significant granger drivers are mainly located at high latitudes in the northern hemisphere and also in parts of southern north america western africa and southeastern asia 5 discussion at the global scale we detected no significant overall trend in agreement with milliman et al 2008 dai et al 2009 and alkama et al 2011 the average tsa slope showed different trend patterns for different continents complex factors contribute to the discrepant global streamflow trends although global warming is expected to intensify the hydrological cycle according to the clausius clapeyron relationship wu et al 2013 miao et al 2016a b uncertainty remains milliman et al 2008 restrepo et al 2014 in fact the increase in aerosol emissions since the mid twentieth century counteract greenhouse gas driven warming and act to suppress the hydrological cycle by producing a surface energy deficit wu et al 2013 changes in streamflow are generally dominated by precipitation variability alkama et al 2011 gerten et al 2008 mccabe and wolock 2011 however although global average precipitation increases with climate change a large portion of this increase occurs over oceans with continents experiencing regionally heterogeneous trends arnell 1999 piao et al 2007 the oceans which comprise 71 of global surface area are estimated to receive over 80 of global rainfall durack et al 2012 it is also noteworthy that increased temperature results in a reduction in streamflow efficiency i e the fraction of annual precipitation that becomes streamflow due to increased evapotranspiration mccabe and wolock 2011 therefore despite prominent regional trends no significant trends in streamflow have been observed at the global scale at the regional scale the increases in streamflow were primarily found in high latitude areas and the decreases in streamflow were primarily found in low and mid latitude areas this regional trend pattern is consistent with the streamflow trends reported in previous studies gerten et al 2008 milliman et al 2008 nijssen et al 2001 piao et al 2007 according to dai et al 2009 precipitation decreased over many low and mid latitude areas accounting for the decline in streamflow over the period 1948 2004 nijssen et al 2001 suggest that most of the increased precipitation predicted by general circulation models gcms occurs during the winter at high latitudes the increased winter precipitation is stored as snow and then contributes to increased streamflow during the following snow melt period in contrast precipitation and evapotranspiration are largely in phase at low and middle latitude areas meanwhile as global temperatures have increased storm tracks have moved poleward resulting in a shift in precipitation and thus streamflow toward higher latitudes mccabe and wolock 2011 there has been an approximately 4 increase in annual precipitation for the circumpolar region north of 50 n over the past 50 years groisman et al 2005 furthermore surface warming at high latitudes has caused a degradation of the permafrost which may also contribute to increases in streamflow at these latitudes alkama et al 2011 our comparative study of four different mk techniques shows that there are strong autocorrelations and significant long term changes in streamflow globally it is evident that the trends reported are strongly affected by these factors there was a clear reduction in the number of rivers with significant streamflow trends when the full autocorrelation structure mk3 and ltp behavior mk4 were considered in the analysis from 171 rivers with mk1 to 120 with mk3 and 109 with mk4 statistically autocorrelation can cause spurious empirical significance levels for the mk1 test compared with the nominal significance levels which may lead to the hypothesis test being less sensitive the empirical significance levels for mk3 are much closer to the correct nominal significance levels hamed and rao 1998 when we analyzed the streamflow trends of 259 rivers with significant ltp we found a large reduction in the number of rivers with significant trends decreasing from 70 with mk1 ltp not taken into account to eight with mk4 ltp taken into account the results are consistent with previous findings that trend tests that do not take ltp into account greatly overstate the statistical significance of the observed trends and that taking ltp into account leads to a reduction in the number of significant trends detected when ltp is present koutsoyiannis 2003 cohn and lins 2005 koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 khaliq et al 2008 sagarika et al 2014 natural variability such as solar forcing and volcanic activity and anthropogenic local factors are cited as some of the possible reasons for ltp behavior in the data series koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 kumar et al 2009 in addition to the large changes seen when taking ltp into account we observed smaller negligible departures when we took only lag 1 autocorrelation into consideration thus the mk2 analysis method is not sufficient to remove all significant serial correlations in the data series kumar et al 2009 sagarika et al 2014 overall using four mk tests helped to differentiate the trends that existed under the assumption of serial independence the gc test showed strong causal links between climatic indices ao nao soi niño 3 4 pdo and global continental discharge the most prominent causal relationships were those between the enso signals the soi and niño 3 4 and streamflow which were statistically significant for 36 57 soi and 38 43 niño 3 4 of the rivers in this study with significant causality located mainly in southern north america large portions of south america parts of europe southern asia eastern oceania and southeastern and northwestern africa similar evident correlations between the enso and streamflow have been identified in previous studies chiew and mcmahon 2002 milliman and farnsworth 2013 restrepo et al 2014 the strong teleconnection may arise from the influence of the enso on global precipitation during enso events large precipitation anomalies in the tropics are induced by the re arrangement of walker circulation convection centers over the pacific indian and atlantic oceans the associated changes in the monsoon systems via the hadley cell and their interactions with mid latitude westerlies generate coherent anomaly patterns over the extra tropics dai and wigley 2000 granger causality between the ao nao and freshwater discharge is significant in about 27 51 25 93 of the 818 rivers we studied with significant causality located mainly in large parts of europe south america southern north america and southeastern asia these results are consistent with bierkens and van beek 2009 david 2010 dickson et al 2000 and labat 2006 because of the dominance of the atlantic arctic sector on the ao the nao and the ao are nearly indistinguishable in the time domain and have an analogous influence on wind heat flux evaporation precipitation etc dickson et al 2000 the nao and the ao are both changes in pressure systems and mainly have effects on precipitation via the enhancement or diminishment of moisture advection in the northern hemisphere in winter antico et al 2014 david 2010 therefore the ao and the nao are strongly correlated with winter discharge anomalies the pdo was granger causal for the variation in streamflow in 25 55 of 818 rivers studied with significant effects generally located in southern north america parts of europe southern asia eastern oceania and south america the pdo regime represents interdecadal oscillations in the north pacific climate system gobena and gan 2009 and is thought to constrain the envelope of interannual enso variability mantua et al 1997 a study by david 2010 revealed that the pdo impacts the 10 30 year discharge variability in asia europe and the americas mantua et al 1997 found that precipitation and temperature in australia are associated with the pdo they also point out that the warm phase of the pdo coincides with anomalously dry periods in parts of oceania asia and the americas the large heat capacity of the ocean allows oceanic climate signals to persist for months resulting in delayed climate responses our gc results showed that one month was the most prominent lag time in other words climate signals from the previous month significantly influenced global streamflow the global distribution of major ocean signal drivers of river flow is mostly similar to that found by milliman and farnsworth 2013 the main difference is that milliman and farnsworth 2013 found that rivers in northern north america and northern asia were largely controlled by the nao ao whereas we tended to find a lack of granger causality between streamflow and ocean signals in these rivers this difference might arise from the differences in methods and data length in the two studies furthermore milliman and farnsworth 2013 identified the primary drivers for precipitation and river discharge whereas we focused on the drivers for streamflow given the strong causal links between ocean signals and global streamflow it would be helpful to assess the degree to which global streamflow can potentially be predicted by oceanic forcing investigating the extent of predictability of global streamflow by oceanic forcing was not an objective of this study but we plan to extend this study in the future by addressing this issue the potential predictability can be thought of as an upper bound on forecast skill or the partitioning of a time series into a predictable low frequency oceanic signal and unpredictable dynamical noise westra and sharma 2010 short gianotti et al 2014 previous studies have mainly focused on the potential predictability of precipitation or temperature using signal to noise ratios kang and shukla 2006 ehsan et al 2013 variance partitioning jia and delsole 2011 saha et al 2016 information based metrics tang et al 2014 saha et al 2016 or linear regression models westra and sharma 2010 etc these previous studies revealed a strong predictability of precipitation by sst in enso regions kang et al 2004 westra and sharma 2010 saha et al 2016 consistent with our result that enso signals predominate in the tropics and subtropics it cannot be assumed however that atmospheric teleconnections are associated with a particular climate mode for example the enso and pdo signals reinforce each other when they are in phase intensifying the climate anomalies over the affected regions gershunov and barnett 1998 furthermore streamflow represents the spatiotemporal integration of all upstream dynamics including human intervention a synthesis by meybeck et al 2004 suggested that direct global anthropogenic effects on the terrestrial water cycle were likely to surpass those of climate change at least at the decadal scale a simulation by piao et al 2007 showed that land use changes mainly deforestation accounted for 50 of the reconstructed global streamflow trends over the last century the transformation of forests to croplands leads to shorter growing periods lower rooting depths and lower interception losses gerten et al 2008 and has resulted in a marked increase in streamflow over the last century piao et al 2007 in asia and south america the expansion of agricultural land may have contributed to an increase in regional discharge similarly the contraction of agricultural land in europe may have contributed to a decrease in regional discharge fig 8 however irrigation accounts for about 70 of global water withdrawals and nearly 90 of consumptive water use cai and rosegrant 2002 shiklomanov and rodda 2003 and diverts about 4 5 of annual global streamflow to evapotranspiration milly and dunne 1994 long term mean global discharge into oceans has decreased by 2 7 because of water withdrawals döll et al 2009 therefore the increase in irrigated agricultural land in asia europe and north america may account for the decreases in regional streamflow in these areas fig 9 population size is regarded as a driving force in the demand for water and has increased rapidly in many areas especially in asia and africa inevitably contributing to the decreases in streamflow fig 10 in order to meet the needs of the expanding population the construction of large dams boomed during the second half of the twentieth century fig 11 reservoirs contribute significantly to the irrigation water supply in many regions including the colorado river and columbia river basins in the united states and several large river basins in india china and central asia biemans et al 2011 reservoirs lead to increased evaporation and changes in the seasonality of river flow but do not necessarily cause much change in the mean annual streamflow haddeland et al 2014 over the long term the average global discharge into oceans and inland sinks has decreased by 0 8 because of dams döll et al 2009 reservoirs appear to be a major factor only for arid to semi arid river basins milliman et al 2008 the cumulative representative maximum storage capacity of reservoirs in north america asia and europe may exert a significant effect on regional streamflow all of the influences described above when combined may account for the slight upward trends in integrated annual river flow in the americas and europe and the slight downward trends in africa asia and oceania integrated river flow into the oceans showed downward trends for all oceans except the arctic ocean consistent with a previous study by dai et al 2009 the gc test is stricter and more reliable than simple lagged correlation statistics because it ensures that any apparent climatic influence on streamflow is indeed from the climatic signal the analysis removes false positive results in which relations with lagged values are in fact the result of autocorrelation within the predicted field wang et al 2004 6 conclusions in this study we performed streamflow trend analysis on 916 global rivers over the period 1948 2004 using four different mk tests we found a greater number of decreases in streamflow than increases at the global scale no overall significant trend was found and the magnitude of trends varied for the different continents prominent regional trends exist because changes in streamflow are generally dominated by precipitation variability which is highly heterogeneous across the world increases in streamflow were predominantly seen in high latitude areas and decreases in streamflow were predominantly seen in low latitude areas this pattern can be attributed to uneven precipitation and the effects of global warming for the americas and europe annual integrated river flow showed a slight upward trend for other continents there was a slight downward trend for all oceans except for the arctic ocean integrated river flow showed a downward trend a comparative study of four mk tests showed a clear reduction in the number of rivers with significant streamflow trends when the when the full autocorrelation structure mk3 and ltp behavior mk4 were taken into account in the analysis negligible departures from the original mk test were observed when only lag 1 autocorrelation was taken into account mann kendall test with trend free pre whitening mk2 overall the use of the four different mk tests helped to differentiate the trends that exist under the assumption of serial independence the gc test found strong causal relationships between the climatic indices and global continental discharge enso signals the soi and niño 3 4 were significantly causal for over 36 of rivers in this study owing to the influence of the enso on global precipitation granger causality between the ao and river flow was significant in 29 26 of rivers and in 25 76 of rivers for the nao and river flow the effects of the ao and the nao were likely due to their influence on wind heat flux evaporation and precipitation etc the pdo had a granger causal effect on streamflow in 25 55 of rivers studied arising from the influence of the pdo on interdecadal oscillations in the north pacific climate system mantua et al 1997 streamflow was affected by the interactions between ocean signals lastly anthropogenic effects may also account for a reasonable proportion of changes in river flow in some regions these results are conducive to a better understanding of global river streamflow trends and will enable the evolution of continental river streamflow to be predicted under changing climate scenarios and changing atmospheric and oceanic conditions moreover our work has important implications for planning and operational strategies concerning the sustainable use of available water resources the lack of availability of longer streamflow records is one of the limitations in understanding trends and causal relationships between streamflow and climatic indices a limitation of our study is that the gc test tacitly assumes a linear relationship between the predictor and the response however in reality the relationship may have more complex dynamics nonlinear causal relationships between additional climate signals and continental streamflow may be investigated in future work acknowledgments this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china no 41622101 the national key research and

7179,temporal variation of water in the vadose zone is important to understand processes such as solute transport and nutrient cycling measurements of soil water content swc in the subsurface are less common than those near the surface and predictions using numerical models are limited by data availability wavelet decomposition of surface measurements of swc could improve modeling of subsurface swc by segregating features at different temporal scales and projecting them to the subsurface the objectives of this work were to 1 predict subsurface swc using surface swc and a combination of wavelet analysis and linear regression and 2 investigate relationships between soil properties and the movement of soil water at various temporal scales s climate data and swc at various depths were collected from eight sites in the atlantic coastal plain of the usa soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity k functions of each horizon were optimized by comparing measured and predicted using hydrus 1d soil water contents each time series of swc was decomposed into 50 scale components using the mexican hat wavelet and later reduced to 5 group components with minimal impact on the characteristics of the signal changes in the values of each group component with depth were represented with transfer coefficients that could be estimated with predictors derived from particle size distributions and optimized soil hydraulic functions prediction depth and saturated k were the two most important predictors for s 256 h while k at 10 kpa was the best predictor for 256 h s 724 h and the median value of particle size diameters for s 724 h subsurface soil water content can be reasonably predicted with the proposed approach particularly when vertical movement of soil water is unrestricted keywords

process influenced by biotic and abiotic factors such as precipitation composition of the soil profile texture and structure of soil horizons and evapotranspiration a detailed characterization of the

the soil climate analysis network scan and the u s climate reference network uscrn are the two largest of these databases with more than 200 sites throughout the usa each with measurements at five standards depths 5 10 20 50 and 100 cm where sensor installation was possible dorigo et al 2011 however continuous records of subsurface soil water content are not available for many regions because instrumentation of soil profiles requires a significant monetary investment and is labor intensive dobriyal et al 2012 muñoz carpena et al 2004 estimation of soil water content in the vadose zone over time and or space is commonly done with numerical models vereecken et al 2008 most hydrological models require at minimum information on hydraulic properties of each horizon or layer forming a soil profile and temporal information on rainfall and evapotranspiration simunek et al 2005 simunek et al 2008 vereecken et al 2008 soil hydraulic properties are difficult to measure particularly when simulating non equilibrium flow with complex models that require a large number of parameters allaire et al 2009 simunek et al 2003 estimation of soil hydraulic parameters with pedotransfer functions and available soil properties is a common practice vereecken et al 2008 van looy et al 2017 but it may introduce a great deal of uncertainty in model predictions finke et al 1996 alternative approaches to the estimation of soil water content include statistical models based on time stability of soil water content measurements typically mean values are separated in space and or time from their corresponding deviations which can then be estimated with soil properties vegetation topography and climate variables hu and si 2016 vanderlinden et al 2012 in addition analytical models have been used to produce long term subsurface water storage from few soil parameters and meteorological data verrot and destouni 2016 measurements of soil water content near the surface are easier to make than deeper in the profile and can be used to reduce the uncertainty and improve prediction of subsurface soil water content das and mohanty 2006 heathman et al 2003 kostov and jackson 1993 kumar et al 2009 li and islam 1999 techniques that incorporate surface observations into the estimation of subsurface soil water content include linear regression numerical models and the combination of remotely sensed data and water balance models kostov and jackson 1993 linear regression is a simple approach to estimate soil water content at variable depths from surface water content but can only be used when soil water movement at all soil layers is hydrologically connected and the temporal dynamics of soil water at the surface and at various depth are similar however processes such as precipitation evapotranspiration and soil water redistribution are likely to induce changes in soil water content at different rates thus predictions with linear regression may be improved by treating periodic seasonal changes separately from relatively rapid and occasional changes of soil water content caused by wetting and drying events the wavelet transform is a technique that can extract periodic and non periodic features from a signal by decomposing the original signal into a number of orthogonal components each characterized by a given frequency time or space while keeping local information farge 1992 graps 1995 wavelet transforms have been used to investigate spatial variation of soil properties biswas and si 2011a lark and webster 1999 lark and webster 2001 identify the controlling factors of soil water storage biswas and si 2011b examine the temporal variation of soil water in relation to weather extremes and to predict monthly temperature and seasonal precipitation lakshmi et al 2004 tang and piechota 2009 wavelet transforms may help overcome some of the limitations related to linear regression models because it is more suitable to evaluate the variation of a data series such as soil water content at different scales pachepsky and hill 2017 wavelet coherence between two transformed data series is a measure of the linearity in their relationships in time or space at specific frequencies grinsted et al 2004 strong coherence between surface soil water content and rainfall time series are typically found at temporal scales ranging between 1 h and 2 weeks parent et al 2006 which is likely a measure of the residence time of soil water in the surface horizons the penetration depth of these short scale features of soil water content signals is relatively shallow and strong coherence between surface 5 cm and subsurface soil water contents are consistently found at greater 256 512 days time scales lauzon et al 2004 similarity in temporal patterns of soil water content between the surface and subsurface was also reported by li et al 2017 these results suggest the possibility of developing a wavelet based statistical model for estimating soil water contents at the subsurface from the assimilation of surface soil water content at different scales the objectives of this research were to investigate 1 the potential for using wavelet transform decomposition of time series of near surface water contents to predict subsurface water contents and 2 relationships between soil physical properties and wavelet derived scale components each representing changes in soil water content at specific time frequencies the hypotheses driving this study are that 1 several individual environmental processes influence soil water content at distinct time frequencies with effects that are additive and altogether determine near surface soil water content at any given time and 2 the temporal changes in surface water content can be transferred to the subsurface using linear functions with component specific transfer coefficients in this study time series of soil water contents were decomposed into 50 scale components using wavelet transform which were further clustered into 5 group components clustering was done to preserve signal information while achieving a reasonable reduction in the dimension of the model with the aim of understanding soil properties controlling the transfer of water at various scales linear regression was used to obtain the transfer coefficients describing the relationships between the values of each component at the surface and at the depths of interest while multivariable linear regression was used to explore correlations between those transfer coefficients and soil properties such as water retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity derived using a numerical model particle size distribution and depth to the observation point 2 materials and methods 2 1 site characterization soil water content measurements soil physical properties and meteorological data hourly precipitation air temperature wind speed relative humidity atmospheric pressure and net radiation from eight sites located in the atlantic coastal plain region of the united states were collected from databases table 1 except for precipitation the meteorological data was used to calculate potential evapotranspiration pet with the penman monteith method irmak et al 2005 leaf area index lai was obtained from modis global subsets lp daac 2017 at the two sites of the new jersey weather and climate network njwxnet soil water content was measured hourly with cs616 water content reflectometer probes campbell scientific inc logan ut usa installed roughly in the center of major soil horizons table 2 in addition six sites with soil water content records that were continuous for at least four years were selected from the soil climate analysis network scan nrcs 2017 hourly soil water contents at the scan sites were measured using stevens hydra probe sensors stevens water monitoring system inc portland or usa the probes were placed at five fixed depths table 2 information on soil horizons for the njwxnet sites depth thickness root sizes and abundance soil particle size distributions and water retention properties measured in disturbed samples were obtained from joseph et al 2010 for the rest of the sites data on soil horizons were obtained from the scan database with water retention data represented as water retained at 30 kpa and at 1500 kpa schaefer et al 2007 2 2 optimization of soil hydraulic parameters hydraulic properties of the soils at the study sites were estimated by inverse modeling to understand the possible control exerted by these properties on the movement of soil water at different scales the van genuchten 1980 model was selected to represent water retention properties of the horizons of interest 1 s e 1 1 ah n vg m where h is pressure potential a and n vg are fitting parameters m 1 1 n vg with n vg 1 and s e is effective water content 2 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where θ is soil water content at pressure potential h θ s and θ r are the saturated and residual water contents respectively the hydraulic conductivity function k s e was obtained as van genuchten 1980 3 k s e k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where k s the saturated hydraulic conductivity and l is a parameter representing pore connectivity which was set to a value of 1 as suggested by schaap and leij 2000 for sandy soils at each site model periods ranging from 2 to 3 months table 1 with soil temperature fluctuations of no more than 10 c but including wide variations in soil water contents were selected for optimizing θ r θ s a n vg and k s for all described horizons by simulating their water contents with hydrus 1d combined with a bayesian algorithm the differential evolution adaptive metropolis algorithm dream zs scharnagl et al 2011 vrugt et al 2008 vrugt et al 2009 soil profiles were represented conceptually using nodes with a fixed nodal spacing of 10 mm within horizons and variable spacing decreasing to 2 mm in the proximity of the horizon interfaces to better compute transitions in water content at the boundaries between materials for all sites the upper boundary was set to time variable atmospheric conditions with surface runoff and the lower boundary was set to free drainage for sites nj295 and nj284 the choice of free drainage was based on the historical records of groundwater levels from the nearest observation wells nwis 2017 which indicated that groundwater levels were typically deeper than 30 m at nj295 and 9 m at nj284 and did not encroach on the near surface region investigated in this effort similarly groundwater depth at the scan sites varied between 4 and 37 m during the simulation periods considered nwis 2017 while the deepest observation was at about 1 m table 2 at each site distributions of pressure potentials with depth were calculated from soil water content measurements and water retention properties and used to initialize the corresponding model the feddes water uptake model was selected for root water uptake with default parameters for pasture because grass was the prevailing vegetation at all sites root distributions were assigned values of 0 0 7 or 1 based on the quantities of roots specified in the field descriptions table 2 prior distributions required to run the dream zs algorithm initially came from parameters selected based on soil textural classes from table 4 of schaap and leij 1998 a large range was given to all parameters to avoid local optimization except for the values of θ r and θ s whose upper and lower range boundaries were defined by the smallest θ r or largest θ s soil water content observations respectively an estimated scale reduction r equal to 1 2 was used as the criterion to remove the pre convergence samples from the chains and all the remaining samples were considered to be unbiased by the prior distribution and used to derive the posterior distribution of fitting parameters gelman and rubin 1992 initial conditions of the hydrus 1d models and prior distributions used in the dream zs algorithm were updated with the distribution of predicted hydraulic parameters from the previous run when more than one run was executed a gaussian log likelihood function was used to evaluate each simulation and maximum log likelihood was used to identify optimal parameters goodness of fit for soil water content simulations using the optimized hydraulic parameters from the dream zs algorithm were determined with the coefficient of determination r 2 estimated according to simunek and hopmans 2002 4 r 2 w i y i obs y i sim w i y i obs w i y i sim w i 2 w i y i obs 2 w i y i obs 2 w i w i y i sim 2 w i y i sim 2 w i

development of the wavelet based regression model thirty eight time series of soil water contents from eight sensors placed near the surface and thirty sensors located at various depths in the subsurface were decomposed into 50 scale components using wavelet transform fig 1 a scale components were clustered into group components fig 1b to facilitate the investigation of relationships between the wavelet derived scale components and soil physical properties by reducing the number of scales involved in the prediction of soil water contents scale components were grouped following five clustering scenarios fig 2 and model development proceeded in parallel using scale and group components fig 1 relationships between scale group components from measurements at the surface and at a single depth were assumed to be linear and the transfer coefficients were derived with linear regression fig 1c the fitted transfer coefficients for each depth investigated were then used to estimate the components at the corresponding depth fig 1d next soil water contents at a given depth were predicted by adding the corresponding mean soil water content obtained from measurements to the sum of the estimated components fig 1e 2 3 1 wavelet decomposition the first step in wavelet transform is to produce a zero mean signal by subtracting the mean from each value in the time series the signal can then be decomposed into components at variant frequencies which are considered as scales in the time domain fig 1a the mexican hat wavelet was chosen as the basis function because of its strength in detecting peaks in temporal scales torrence and compo 1998 parent et al 2006 5 ψ s t 2 3 s π 1 4 1 t 2 s 2 e t 2 2 s 2 where ψ is the amplitude of the wavelet at a specific temporal scale s and time t mallat 1998 fixed values of scales were determined according to 6 s s 0 2 n 1 δ s n 1 2 3 n where s 0 is the smallest scale applied in the wavelet transform defined as s 0 2 δ t with δ t equal to the sampling time interval 1 h in this research n is a scale index that varies between 1 and the total number of scales n δ s is a parameter that determines the separation between scales 0 25 in this study scales larger than 9741 h were not considered because edge effects decrease the statistical significance of the analysis beyond that scale a total of fifty scales n 50 resulted from limiting the largest scale s to 9741 h eq 6 the wavelet coefficient w t s of a time series f t with duration t is defined as the convolution of f t with wavelet ψ s t at scale s and time t 7 w t s μ f t 1 s ψ t μ s dt where μ is the translating parameter which indicates the region of interest and the asterisk denotes the convolution between the time series signal and the wavelet basis mallat 1998 the wavelet power spectrum is defined as w t s 2 and the energy of scale s can be calculated as 8 e t 1 t w t s 2 each time series of soil water content was transformed into a wavelet coefficient matrix w t s using the cwtft function in matlab released 2011a the mathworks inc the inverse function icwtft was applied to reconstruct the signals into individual scale components by using only the coefficients of the selected scale and setting the coefficients of all other scales equal to zero thus each reconstructed signal became 50 scaled components that were independent from each other fig 1a the sum of all scale components reconstructs a data series similar to the original soil water content time series which was confirmed by the small value of the average root mean square error 0 006 cm3 cm 3 of all the reconstructed soil water content time series matlab codes associated with wavelet decomposition are available upon request 2 3 2 clustering in this study clustering refers to grouping i e summing of a pre determined number of original scale components c d t n into group components c d t g fig 1b this step was taken to reduce the number of transfer coefficients either derived from linear regression during model development or predicted from multivariate linear regression in the prediction model introduced later 9 c d t g n i n j c d t n g 1 g where i and j are indices of the first and the last scale components of a group g is the group component index and g is the total number of group components in a clustering scenario fig 2 for time series of soil water contents measured at a depth closest to the soil surface 5 or 10 cm in this study the subscript top is used instead of d i e c top t g see table a1 for a list of symbols 2 3 3 derivation of transfer coefficients for scale group components one of the hypothesis of this work is that temporal changes in water content at given scales transfer linearly with depth thus linear regression was used to derive transfer coefficients between zero mean decomposed scale components of each scale fig 1c 10 c d t n a d n c top t n where c top t n and c d t n are the nth components derived from measurements at the surface and at a depth d respectively and a d n represents a transfer coefficient from the soil surface to the depth d the zero intercept in eq 10 is a result of using zero mean decomposed components features in a scale component were assumed to either transfer from surface to a depth d a d n 0 or vanish before reaching that depth a d n 0 one negative a d n value was set to zero because there was no linear relationship between the scale components transfer coefficients for group components a d g were obtained in the same way as individual scale components but using group components c d t g instead of c d t n fig 1c 11 c d t g a d g c top t g 2 3 4 prediction of scale group components from fitted transfer coefficients one essential step in the development of a prediction model is to use the transfer coefficients derived with eqs 10 or 11 to obtain subsurface scale c d t n or group c d t g components from the corresponding surface components i e c top t n or c top t g according to fig 1d 12 c d t n a d n c top t n 13 c d t g a d g c top t g 2 3 5 reconstruction of soil water content signals soil water content at depth d and time t θ d t was estimated by adding the average water content at that depth θ d calculated over the period used for the wavelet analysis table 1 to the sum of predicted scale eq 12 or group eq 13 components from each scenario fig 1e 14 θ d t θ d n

of the prediction model and to understand the most important scales related to the temporal dynamics of soil water content the formulation of a prediction model requires the estimation of transfer coefficients and mean soil water contents at the corresponding depths the approach taken in this research was to predict transfer coefficients a d g from soil properties fig 1f including optimized hydraulic properties and to estimate mean soil water content θ d from few randomly sampled data from the measured time series the prediction model was developed with group components clustering 5 g 5 in eq 15 was selected based on the evaluation of the performance of all clustering scenarios in relation to predictions with eq 14 see section 2 5 multivariable linear regression models were built using spss released 2007 version 16 0 spss inc for estimation of transfer coefficients a d g from several predictors selected from a pool of available properties table 3 for each set of five fitted a d g values two variables that were most significantly correlated with fitted a d g but not correlated with each other were selected as initial predictors stepwise linear regression as implemented in spss was used to select other predictors with f to enter and f to remove set at p 0 05 and p 0 1 respectively finally correlations among predictors selected by the stepwise regression procedure were tested to eliminate multicollinearity by removing the less significant of two correlated predictors at p 0 01 fig 1f in this work an approach similar to the bootstrap and random combination sampling procedure introduced by wang et al 2008 was used to estimate mean soil water content at depth d θ d the method does not require the assumption of normality in the distribution of soil water contents and has an accuracy comparable to other techniques that require larger sample sizes wang et al 2008 a total of 176 data series each containing annual data for a given depth and location were used to estimate θ d by selecting at random soil water content measurements taken between 8 00 am to 6 00 pm as a way of simulating manual sampling the effect of sample size on θ d was evaluated by increasing the number of measurements included in a sample from 1 to 50 in increments of 1 the sampling process was repeated 1000 times for each sample size and the appropriate sample size was identified as the value when the 95 confidence interval of θ d was within the range of measured θ d 0 05 cm3 cm 3 see supplemental material figs c1 and c2 which is considered a reasonable observation error huisman et al 2001 topp and davis 1985 the prediction model model pred in fig 1e then uses estimated transfer coefficients a d g and estimated mean soil water content θ d to predict temporal variation of soil

gain hg fluctuation complexity σ γ 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and bayesian information criteria bic the quality of each prediction was assessed by comparing mean information gain hg and fluctuation complexity σ γ 2 of daily averages of soil water contents reconstructed with different clustering scenarios fig 2 pachepsky et al 2006 the mean information gain measures information content with larger hg values indicating higher randomness in the values of a series fluctuation complexity quantifies the diversity of patterns found in a data series with smaller σ γ 2 values indicating simple patterns pachepsky et al 2006 caused by for instance data series with constant values simple structure or random data no structure details on the calculation of hg and σ γ 2 are

structure of the model i e clustering scale components into group components and assuming a linear relationship between surface and subsurface group components these errors were assessed individually using the difference in the sum of squared errors sse between predictions with and without a given error source normalized by the former sse values the error percentile introduced by the estimation of mean soil water content e θ d is 19 e θ d 100 sse θ mp sse θ mp sse θ mp where sse θ mp is the sum of squared errors calculated using predictions with eq 16 and observations that included the mean value of the data series and sse θ mp is calculated in the same way but with zero mean predictions and observations obtained by subtracting the mean value of the observation data from each measurement the remaining error in predictions with eq 16 are caused by the estimation of a d g the clustering the scale components and by assuming linear relationships between surface and subsurface group components e a d g c lr values of a d g used in eq 16 were derived from soil properties while the values of a d g in clustering 5 scenario were fitted using observations eq 11 therefore the difference between predictions with eq 16 and clustering 5 scenario can be used to evaluate the influence of a d g e a d g on e a d g c lr 20 e a d g 100 sse θ mp sse θ 5 sse θ mp where s s e θ 5 is the sum of squared errors calculated using zero mean predictions from clustering 5 scenario and zero mean observations the remaining errors in eq 16 that could not be explained by e θ d or e a d g were considered as errors introduced by model structure i e clustering and linear fitting e c lr zero mean predictions from no clustering and clustering 5 were used to calculate the percentage of error introduced by clustering the scale components into group components e c 21 e c 100 sse θ 5 sse θ 50 sse θ 5 where sse θ 50 is the sum of squared errors of zero mean predictions with the no clustering scenario the remaining error was mainly caused by linear fitting e lr 22 e lr 100 e c 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil properties the textures of the 35 horizons sampled in this study were classified into nine of the textural classes defined in the usda soil texture classification table 2 the only classes that were not represented were silt silty clay loam and silty clay sandy loam and sand had the largest representations with 10 and 8 horizons respectively overall there was a predominance of the sand fraction in the studied soils fig 3 and the three horizons at site s2013 were the only ones classified as clay textural composition remained relatively constant with depth except for three sites in which the clay s2013 or sand nj295 and nj284 size fractions increased with depth these textural changes particularly over a short distance may alter water flow and hinder the performance of the wavelet based model because of potential decoupling in water movement between the surface and subsurface mean soil water contents θ d were negatively correlated to sand r2 0 356 data not shown the largest deviation in this relationship was observed in a thin iron cemented horizon with a well defined abrupt boundary found between 126 and 128 cm below the surface at site nj295 fig 3 this cemented horizon has similar texture to horizons above and below it but it has a massive structure that resulted in greater θ d and smaller optimized ks values than expected from its sand content table 2 although no historical records indicated groundwater impacts to the study profiles there were several unexpected increases of subsurface soil water content that were not observed in the overlying horizons such at sites s2049 s2013 s2027 s2009 and nj295 supplemental material fig c3 changes in subsurface soil water content with no correspondence at shallower depths are a potential limitation to the analysis proposed in this work soil hydraulic parameters for each horizon were optimized by fitting soil water content observations using the dream zs algorithm to run hydrus 1d tables 1 and 2 most model predictions using optimized parameters had a coefficient of determination r 2 greater than 0 78 except for site s2012 where surface observations 5 cm and 10 cm have smaller fluctuations than in the subsurface deeper than 10 cm despite the fact that the texture of the soil profile is sand and sites s2049 and s2013 both containing increases in water content at 100 cm that were not connected with surface processes when grouped by textural classes most values of the optimized parameters were within the range defined by the mean standard deviation of the corresponding textural class values given by schaap and leij 1998 suggesting that the estimated parameters are reasonable fig 4 optimized parameters for the textural class sand deviated the most from the range reported by schaap and leij 1998 values of optimized θ r and n vg were smaller than the lower boundary of the range and values of a had a larger spread than the range for sand during optimization values of θ r were forced to be smaller than the smallest observed value of soil water content which may have influenced the values of parameters a and n vg values of k s from the three horizons classified as clay were noticeably larger than the upper bound in schaap and leij 1998 these three horizons were in site s2013 and had extreme fluctuations in soil water content at 100 cm that may have induced larger estimated values of k s needed to simulate the observed rapid changes fig c3 considering all horizons estimated ks did not show a clear relationship with soil texture fig 4 or root distribution data not shown but within a profile values dropped more than one order of magnitude table 2 for horizons with smaller variations in soil water content values than the adjacent horizons e g nj 295 at 127 cm and nj 284 at 221 cm and 302 cm fig c3 3 2 analysis of soil water content measurements the wavelet power spectrum w t s 2 estimated by squaring the wavelet coefficient eq 7 represents the time frequency distribution of energy of a signal fig 5 b d in general the power spectra of all the sites had multiple high frequency features that were non periodic and were contained between scales 0 h and 256 h also most of the energy e eq 8 of the soil water content signals were concentrated on scales between 256 h and 4096 h followed by scales larger than 4096 h fig 5e g these high frequency power features are typically synchronized with precipitation events lauzon et al 2004 and are visible mainly at near surface soil water content measurements fig 5 at deeper horizons high frequency features appeared when water content in the soil profile was close to saturation which typically occurred during the winter although there was one exception to this in late august 2011 during hurricane irene when a cumulative rainfall of 184 mm was recorded at the site during 24 h starting at noon august 27 this produced an increase in water content detected by the sensor placed at about 270 cm that appeared as a high frequency peak in the wavelet power spectrum fig 5d in addition periodic power features were mainly found at scales between 861 h and 4096 h with the strongest one occurring approximately every six months 2048 h note that scales longer than 9741 h were not considered because inferences were affected by edge effects related to the length of the record used see cone of influence in fig 5 decoupling of the power spectra at progressively greater depths may occur when a layer or horizon alters water movement for instance the iron cemented layer found at 127 cm in site nj295 fig 5c had a distinctively different pattern of wavelet power spectrum than horizons above and below it mean information gain h g and fluctuation complexity σ γ 2 of soil water content measurements were calculated for daily averages to circumvent the possible confounding effect of noise in hourly measurements of water content in general values of h g and σ γ 2 averaged by depth for the scan sites decreased with depth observation in fig 6 which agrees with results reported by pan et al 2011 this indicates that time series of soil water content at the surface are characterized by greater randomness and a more complex data structure pachepsky et al 2006 this is also evident in the presence of more frequent non periodic features in the power spectra of surface signals fig 5 3 3 soil water content prediction with transfer coefficients transfer coefficients a d n in eq 10 were fitted using the scale components from surface and subsurface water contents in order to predict subsurface scale components most values of a d n were between 0 and 1 which means that energy was damped when transferred from the surface to the subsurface this is particularly true at scales smaller than 45 h fig 7 a which implies that non periodic features tend not to penetrate deeper into the soil fig 5 there were instances in which the values of a d n were greater than 1 which would imply that energy increased in magnitude with depth fig 7a the possible cause of this phenomenon could be internal water redistribution from horizons above or below the horizon of interest generally values of a d n greater than 1 were observed at scale components larger than about 300 h likely because water redistribution could be a slow process values of a d n greater than 1 2 were obtained for scales larger than 300 h at sites s2013 and s2009 100 cm and nj284 50 cm temporal variation of soil water content at 100 cm in s2013 and s2009 exhibited periodic patterns of unknown origin that did not show at the soil surface and the horizon at 50 cm in site nj284 has continuous tubular pores joseph et al 2010 which may have contributed to larger magnitudes of soil water fluctuation in this horizon fig c3 soil water contents were estimated with eq 14 by adding average values of measured soil water contents at depth d θ d to the sum of all 50 scales components this is considered to be the best possible prediction scenario because it is a full reconstruction using all the scales and a d n values were obtained using subsurface scales components c d t n derived from measurements no clustering in figs 7 and 8 most predictions using all scale components had a nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse greater than 0 4 which indicates a satisfactory prediction for hourly data foglia et al 2009 moriasi et al 2007 horizons with lower nse values typically at 100 cm in scan sites included rapid fluctuations of water content occurring outside the growing season and apparently disconnected from water content fluctuations at the surface fig 8 another exception was site nj295 where decoupling between surface and bottom horizons was likely caused by the iron cemented layer found between 126 and 128 cm below the surface fig 8g values of h g and σ γ 2 obtained with the predictions using 50 scales components compared well with the values of h g and σ γ 2 of the measured water contents compare no clustering with observation in fig 8 except for those horizons containing data with unexplained trends as described above i e s2013 at 100 cm fig 8c and s2009 at 50 cm and 100 cm fig 8e this provides further indication that the model is not applicable when decoupling between surface and subsurface water contents takes place 3 4 soil water content prediction with group components scale components were clustered using eq 9 to reduce the number of transfer coefficients a d n estimated with eq 10 to a number of transfer coefficients a d g varying between 1 and 5 eq 11 values of a d g were derived using the group components from surface and subsurface soil water contents following 5 scenarios described in fig 2 in all clustering cases water contents were calculated with eqs 14 and 15 by adding the same values of θ d derived using all measurements values of h g and σ γ 2 fig 8 were used to evaluate clustering scenarios because these measures allow the comparison of information content and data structure of predictions across all clustering scenarios grouping the 50 scale components into one group clustering 1 is equivalent to the linear regression approach that uses measured water content at the surface without wavelet decomposition kostov and jackson 1993 thus transferring the same information to the subsurface regardless of depth or frequency this is evident by the values of h g and σ γ 2 that remained constant with depth because a single transfer coefficient was used when more than one group was used h g and σ γ 2 tended to decrease with depth and to follow the values of h g and σ γ 2 obtained with measured data observation in figs 6 and 8 and fig 8 values of h g and σ γ 2 from predictions using five groups clustering 5 and fifty scales no clustering were similar at all sites while predictions with two clustering 2 three clustering 3 and four clustering 4 groups were not always consistent with trends of no clustering fig 8 values of bic were in accordance with the results from h g and σ γ 2 the best and the second best predictions varied between no clustering and clustering 5 scenario for 26 out of 30 depths no clustering scenario was the best model for 16 out of 30 depths and clustering 5 scenario had the smallest bic values for the remaining 10 depths fig 8 considering the advantage of reducing the number of transfer coefficients from 50 no clustering to 5 clustering 5 the clustering 5 model was selected to develop the prediction model notably the use of nse did not help distinguishing among different clustering scenarios fig 8 3 5 prediction model 3 5 1 estimation of transfer coefficients a d g and mean water content θ d correlations between soil properties table 3 and fitted a d g values of the five group components of clustering 5 scenario were explored in an attempt to understand controls exerted by the soil profile on the temporal changes of subsurface soil water content fig 9 properties most significantly p 0 01 correlated with a d g varied with the group components non transformed and log transformed effective saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity values were positively correlated to the a d g values of the first three group components which altogether cover from 2 h to about 85 days 2048 h this result suggests that the transfer of water pulses from the surface deep into the soil profile facilitated by relatively large hydraulic conductivity values tends to preserve the properties of the signal on the other hand soil properties most correlated to the a d g values of groups 4 and 5 fig 9 which cover scales from approximately 90 days 2436 h to more than one year 9741 h were those derived from texture all parameters representing particle diameter were negatively correlated while clay content was positively correlated with a d g values this implies that low frequency signals are preserved at depth by fine textured soils likely because of their greater water retention capacity multivariable linear regression was conducted to investigate soil properties that could be used to predict a d g for each of the five groups fig 10 variables in the model of each group included the two variables found to be most correlated to the a d g of that group fig 9 as long as they were not correlated with each other the two most important properties in these models were effective saturated hydraulic conductivity k s e and the median particle size d50 defined in table 3 more than 90 of the predicted a d g values were within 0 4 of the fitted a d g values derived from observations using clustering 5 scenario although predictions of greater values were more common 55 than the opposite case fig 10 these results were derived from a limited number of observations and are not considered sufficiently robust to be used for predictive purposes nevertheless they indicate that values of a d g could be predicted with acceptable accuracy from basic soil properties the use of pedotransfer functions to predict hydraulic conductivities should be investigated in this context mean values of water content θ d were estimated from 10 random samples per year fig c2 the values of θ d were within observed mean value θ d 0 05 cm3 cm 3 in 92 of the time series considered while using 6 random samples per year reduced that number to 78 these results are comparable to the ones reported by tague et al 2010 who proposed 15 samples with an accuracy of 0 03 cm3 cm 3 exceptions were time series that had large standard deviations i e observations at 5 cm in s2008 and at 100 cm in s2013 fig c3 and required between 10 and 51 samples per year extremely large values of soil water content at 100 cm in s2013 were concentrated in the winter time and shifted the values of mean soil water content upwards suggesting that the proper sampling scheme should consider seasonal variations and cannot be properly captured with purely random sampling considering all soil horizons values of θ d estimated from 10 random samples year were within 0 015 cm3 cm 3 of the measured values 3 5 2 soil water content prediction with estimated a d g and θ d in general prediction of water content model pred see fig 11 using estimated values of a d g resulted in time series with similar values of hg and larger values of σ γ 2 than those derived with clustering 5 scenario figs 6 and 8 which used fitted a d g deviations between these two types of predictions tended to be small at depths close to the measured soil water content used as reference effects of estimated a d g on the characteristics of the predicted soil water content signals can be better discerned by looking at cases where estimated a d g of all five groups are either larger or smaller than values of fitted a d g derived with clustering 5 scenario which altogether represented about 43 of the cases considered over prediction of all five values of a d g at 50 cm in both s2049 and s2013 sites fig 10 resulted in a signal with greater values of hg and σ γ 2 than the corresponding prediction with clustering 5 fig 8a and c on the other hand under prediction of a d g at 100 cm in the same sites derived in final predicted signals with similar or slightly smaller hg and σ γ 2 than those in clustering 5 fig 8a and c notably signals at depth 207 cm and 302 cm in nj284 with very low standard deviations 0 007 and 0 008 also had large discrepancies in the values of hg and σ γ 2 between the two methods possibly because small variations in the predictions could introduce large differences in data structure overall predictions with model pred resulted in nse values greater than 0 4 fig 8 which is considered satisfactory for hourly predictions foglia et al 2009 moriasi et al 2007 negative nse values were computed at depths 207 cm and 302 cm of site nj284 indicating that the predictions were worse than using the mean value to represent the signals likely due to the low standard deviations of these measurements 3 6 error analysis of prediction model the major sources of error in the prediction model model pred were introduced by the assumption that surface and subsurface components are linearly related e lr and by the estimation of a d g from soil properties e a d g the errors contributed by the estimation of θ d e θ d were relatively small and those introduced by clustering e c were the smallest of all the sources considered fig 12 values of e θ d were less than 20 of the total sum of squared errors of the predictions with model pred in 29 of the 30 depths considered and less than 5 at 22 depths the one exception was at site s2049 10 cm with 53 errors explained by θ d fig 12a that depth site had the largest error in the estimation of θ d among all estimated values of θ d in this study 0 015 cm3 cm 3 the error not accounted by e θ d was caused by the other mentioned sources e a d g c lr estimation of a d g introduced less than 45 of e a d g c lr whereas the remaining portion of the error 55 was caused by model structure e c lr except at 2 depths of site nj284 where values of e c lr were relatively small fig 12b less than 5 of e c lr was the result of the clustering process e c whereas the largest error in the wavelet based regression model was caused mainly by the linear fitting e lr fig 12c it should be noted that e lr might also contain errors from unknown sources such as measurement errors that occur at the surface and are transferred to the subsurface and information loss from wavelet decomposition of surface observations the uncertainty derived from each of the steps in the prediction model was not estimated in this work in part because a meaningful analysis should include a larger database with more representation of other soils and geographic regions nevertheless the analysis of the different components of the errors suggest that the largest uncertainty stem from the use of a linear function to connect surface and subsurface group components and that other functions should be investigated estimation of a d g needs to be further improved by incorporating a greater range of soil textures and possibly landscape properties such as topography and land use 4 conclusions this study shows that wavelet based regression models can predict temporal variations of subsurface soil water content from surface measurements the performance of the model worsens with depth particularly in the presence of discontinuities in the soil profile that could potentially decouple surface and subsurface signals one of the advantages of using wavelets decomposition of time series of soil water content is the identification of soil properties correlated to changes in soil water content at different temporal scales which could improve the understanding of processes such as soil water redistribution and preferential flow the availability of datasets of water contents for different soil types offers an opportunity to derive the parameters of this model at the regional scale and to further investigate methods to predict mean soil water content and the relationships between the decomposed components from surface and subsurface moreover soil water content estimated from microwave remotely sensed data could be used to predict distributions of subsurface water content at the landscape scale acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge support from the new jersey department of environmental protection through

7179,temporal variation of water in the vadose zone is important to understand processes such as solute transport and nutrient cycling measurements of soil water content swc in the subsurface are less common than those near the surface and predictions using numerical models are limited by data availability wavelet decomposition of surface measurements of swc could improve modeling of subsurface swc by segregating features at different temporal scales and projecting them to the subsurface the objectives of this work were to 1 predict subsurface swc using surface swc and a combination of wavelet analysis and linear regression and 2 investigate relationships between soil properties and the movement of soil water at various temporal scales s climate data and swc at various depths were collected from eight sites in the atlantic coastal plain of the usa soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity k functions of each horizon were optimized by comparing measured and predicted using hydrus 1d soil water contents each time series of swc was decomposed into 50 scale components using the mexican hat wavelet and later reduced to 5 group components with minimal impact on the characteristics of the signal changes in the values of each group component with depth were represented with transfer coefficients that could be estimated with predictors derived from particle size distributions and optimized soil hydraulic functions prediction depth and saturated k were the two most important predictors for s 256 h while k at 10 kpa was the best predictor for 256 h s 724 h and the median value of particle size diameters for s 724 h subsurface soil water content can be reasonably predicted with the proposed approach particularly when vertical movement of soil water is unrestricted keywords signal decomposition and clustering information gain fluctuation complexity mean soil water content bayesian information criteria 1 introduction movement of water in the vadose zone is a complex process influenced by biotic and abiotic factors such as precipitation composition of the soil profile texture and structure of soil horizons and evapotranspiration a detailed characterization of the temporal dynamics of soil water content at various depths within soil profiles can help to better understand biochemical processes such as soil respiration including the occurrence of sudden peaks of gas effluxes hot moments related to wetting and drying events borken and matzner 2009 conant et al 2004 leon et al 2014 rubio and detto 2017 wang et al 2015 detection of patterns of water distribution in soil profiles can also be used to identify subsurface flow pathways and to estimate leaching rate of solutes aparicio et al 2008 de rooij 2000 jarvis 2007 jaynes et al 2001 soil water storage is important for reducing uncertainty in weather forecasting and assessing extreme events koster and suarez 2001 seneviratne et al 2010 and soil water found at depths greater than 40 cm has been identified as an indicator of climate or weather extremes lakshmi et al 2004 tang and piechota 2009 recognition of the need of soil water content data with wide spatial coverage has prompted the development of new monitoring techniques ochsner et al 2013 and the establishment of several sensor networks to measure soil water content typically up to 1 m below the soil surface dorigo et al 2011 the soil climate analysis network scan and the u s climate reference network uscrn are the two largest of these databases with more than 200 sites throughout the usa each with measurements at five standards depths 5 10 20 50 and 100 cm where sensor installation was possible dorigo et al 2011 however continuous records of subsurface soil water content are not available for many regions because instrumentation of soil profiles requires a significant monetary investment and is labor intensive dobriyal et al 2012 muñoz carpena et al 2004 estimation of soil water content in the vadose zone over time and or space is commonly done with numerical models vereecken et al 2008 most hydrological models require at minimum information on hydraulic properties of each horizon or layer forming a soil profile and temporal information on rainfall and evapotranspiration simunek et al 2005 simunek et al 2008 vereecken et al 2008 soil hydraulic properties are difficult to measure particularly when simulating non equilibrium flow with complex models that require a large number of parameters allaire et al 2009 simunek et al 2003 estimation of soil hydraulic parameters with pedotransfer functions and available soil properties is a common practice vereecken et al 2008 van looy et al 2017 but it may introduce a great deal of uncertainty in model predictions finke et al 1996 alternative approaches to the estimation of soil water content include statistical models based on time stability of soil water content measurements typically mean values are separated in space and or time from their corresponding deviations which can then be estimated with soil properties vegetation topography and climate variables hu and si 2016 vanderlinden et al 2012 in addition analytical models have been used to produce long term subsurface water storage from few soil parameters and meteorological data verrot and destouni 2016 measurements of soil water content near the surface are easier to make than deeper in the profile and can be used to reduce the uncertainty and improve prediction of subsurface soil water content das and mohanty 2006 heathman et al 2003 kostov and jackson 1993 kumar et al 2009 li and islam 1999 techniques that incorporate surface observations into the estimation of subsurface soil water content include linear regression numerical models and the combination of remotely sensed data and water balance models kostov and jackson 1993 linear regression is a simple approach to estimate soil water content at variable depths from surface water content but can only be used when soil water movement at all soil layers is hydrologically connected and the temporal dynamics of soil water at the surface and at various depth are similar however processes such as precipitation evapotranspiration and soil water redistribution are likely to induce changes in soil water content at different rates thus predictions with linear regression may be improved by treating periodic seasonal changes separately from relatively rapid and occasional changes of soil water content caused by wetting and drying events the wavelet transform is a technique that can extract periodic and non periodic features from a signal by decomposing the original signal into a number of orthogonal components each characterized by a given frequency time or space while keeping local information farge 1992 graps 1995 wavelet transforms have been used to investigate spatial variation of soil properties biswas and si 2011a lark and webster 1999 lark and webster 2001 identify the controlling factors of soil water storage biswas and si 2011b examine the temporal variation of soil water in relation to weather extremes and to predict monthly temperature and seasonal precipitation lakshmi et al 2004 tang and piechota 2009 wavelet transforms may help overcome some of the limitations related to linear regression models because it is more suitable to evaluate the variation of a data series such as soil water content at different scales pachepsky and hill 2017 wavelet coherence between two transformed data series is a measure of the linearity in their relationships in time or space at specific frequencies grinsted et al 2004 strong coherence between surface soil water content and rainfall time series are typically found at temporal scales ranging between 1 h and 2 weeks parent et al 2006 which is likely a measure of the residence time of soil water in the surface horizons the penetration depth of these short scale features of soil water content signals is relatively shallow and strong coherence between surface 5 cm and subsurface soil water contents are consistently found at greater 256 512 days time scales lauzon et al 2004 similarity in temporal patterns of soil water content between the surface and subsurface was also reported by li et al 2017 these results suggest the possibility of developing a wavelet based statistical model for estimating soil water contents at the subsurface from the assimilation of surface soil water content at different scales the objectives of this research were to investigate 1 the potential for using wavelet transform decomposition of time series of near surface water contents to predict subsurface water contents and 2 relationships between soil physical properties and wavelet derived scale components each representing changes in soil water content at specific time frequencies the hypotheses driving this study are that 1 several individual environmental processes influence soil water content at distinct time frequencies with effects that are additive and altogether determine near surface soil water content at any given time and 2 the temporal changes in surface water content can be transferred to the subsurface using linear functions with component specific transfer coefficients in this study time series of soil water contents were decomposed into 50 scale components using wavelet transform which were further clustered into 5 group components clustering was done to preserve signal information while achieving a reasonable reduction in the dimension of the model with the aim of understanding soil properties controlling the transfer of water at various scales linear regression was used to obtain the transfer coefficients describing the relationships between the values of each component at the surface and at the depths of interest while multivariable linear regression was used to explore correlations between those transfer coefficients and soil properties such as water retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity derived using a numerical model particle size distribution and depth to the observation point 2 materials and methods 2 1 site characterization soil water content

content was measured hourly with cs616 water content reflectometer probes campbell scientific inc logan ut usa installed roughly in the center of major soil horizons table 2 in addition six sites with soil water content records that were continuous for at least four years were selected from the soil climate analysis network scan nrcs 2017 hourly soil water contents at the scan sites were measured using stevens hydra probe sensors stevens water monitoring system inc portland or usa the probes were placed at five fixed depths table 2 information on soil horizons for the njwxnet sites depth thickness root sizes and abundance soil particle size distributions and water retention properties measured in disturbed samples were obtained from joseph et al 2010 for the rest of the sites data on soil horizons were obtained from the scan database with water retention data represented as water retained at 30 kpa and at 1500 kpa schaefer et al 2007 2 2 optimization of soil hydraulic parameters hydraulic properties of the soils at the study sites were estimated by inverse modeling to understand the possible control exerted by these properties on the movement of soil water at different scales the van genuchten 1980 model was selected to represent water retention properties of the horizons of interest 1 s e 1 1 ah n vg m where h is pressure potential a and n vg are fitting parameters m 1 1 n vg with n vg 1 and s e is effective water content 2 s e θ θ r θ s θ r where θ is soil water content at pressure potential h θ s and θ r are the saturated and residual water contents respectively the hydraulic conductivity function k s e was obtained as van genuchten 1980 3 k s e k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where k s the saturated hydraulic conductivity and l is a parameter representing pore connectivity which was set to a value of 1 as suggested by schaap and leij 2000 for sandy soils at each site model periods ranging from 2 to 3 months table 1 with soil temperature fluctuations of no more than 10 c but including wide variations in soil water contents were selected for optimizing θ r θ s a n vg and k s for all described horizons by simulating their water contents with hydrus 1d combined with a bayesian algorithm the differential evolution adaptive metropolis algorithm dream zs scharnagl et al 2011 vrugt et al 2008 vrugt et al 2009 soil profiles were represented conceptually using nodes with a fixed nodal spacing of 10 mm within horizons and variable spacing decreasing to 2 mm in the proximity of the horizon interfaces to better compute transitions in water content at the boundaries between materials for all sites the upper boundary was set to time variable atmospheric conditions with surface runoff and the lower boundary was set to free drainage for sites nj295 and nj284 the choice of free drainage was based on the historical records of groundwater levels from the nearest observation wells nwis 2017 which indicated that groundwater levels were typically deeper than 30 m at nj295 and 9 m at nj284 and did not encroach on the near surface region investigated in this effort similarly groundwater depth at the scan sites varied between 4 and 37 m during the simulation periods considered nwis 2017 while the deepest observation was at about 1 m table 2 at each site distributions of pressure potentials with depth were calculated from soil water content measurements and water retention properties and used to initialize the corresponding model the feddes water uptake model was selected for root water uptake with default parameters for pasture because grass was the prevailing vegetation at all sites root distributions were assigned values of 0 0 7 or 1 based on the quantities of roots specified in the field descriptions table 2 prior distributions required to run the dream zs algorithm initially came from parameters selected based on soil textural classes from table 4 of schaap and leij 1998 a large range was given to all parameters to avoid local optimization except for the values of θ r and θ s whose upper and lower range boundaries were defined by the smallest θ r or largest θ s soil water content observations respectively an estimated scale reduction r equal to 1 2 was used as the criterion to remove the pre convergence samples from the chains and all the remaining samples were considered to be unbiased by the prior distribution and used to derive the posterior distribution of fitting parameters gelman and rubin 1992 initial conditions of the hydrus 1d models and prior distributions used in the dream zs algorithm were updated with the distribution of predicted hydraulic parameters from the previous run when more than one run was executed a gaussian log likelihood function was used to evaluate each simulation and maximum log likelihood was used to identify optimal parameters goodness of fit for soil water content simulations using the optimized hydraulic parameters from the dream zs algorithm were determined with the coefficient of determination r 2 estimated according to simunek and hopmans 2002 4 r 2 w i y i obs y i sim w i y i obs w i y i sim w i 2 w i y i obs 2 w i y i obs 2 w i w i y i sim 2 w i y i sim 2 w i

development of the wavelet based regression model thirty eight time series of soil water contents from eight sensors placed near the surface and thirty sensors located at various depths in the subsurface were decomposed into 50 scale components using wavelet transform fig 1 a scale components were clustered into group components fig 1b to facilitate the investigation of relationships between the wavelet derived scale components and soil physical properties by reducing the number of scales involved in the prediction of soil water contents scale components were grouped following five clustering scenarios fig 2 and model development proceeded in parallel using scale and group components fig 1 relationships between scale group components from measurements at the surface and at a single depth were assumed to be linear and the transfer coefficients were derived with linear regression fig 1c the fitted transfer coefficients for each depth investigated were then used to estimate the components at the corresponding depth fig 1d next soil water contents at a given depth were predicted by adding the corresponding mean soil water content obtained from measurements to the sum of the estimated components fig 1e 2 3 1 wavelet decomposition the first step in wavelet transform is to produce a zero mean signal by subtracting the mean from each value in the time series the signal can then be decomposed into components at variant frequencies which are considered as scales in the time domain fig 1a the mexican hat wavelet was chosen as the basis function because of its strength in detecting peaks in temporal scales torrence and compo 1998 parent et al 2006 5 ψ s t 2 3 s π 1 4 1 t 2 s 2 e t 2 2 s 2 where ψ is the amplitude of the wavelet at a specific temporal scale s and time t mallat 1998 fixed values of scales were determined according to 6 s s 0 2 n 1 δ s n 1 2 3 n where s 0 is the smallest scale applied in the wavelet transform defined as s 0 2 δ t with δ t equal to the sampling time interval 1 h in this research n is a scale index that varies between 1 and the total number of scales n δ s is a parameter that determines the separation between scales 0 25 in this study scales larger than 9741 h were not considered because edge effects decrease the statistical significance of the analysis beyond that scale a total of fifty scales n 50 resulted from limiting the largest scale s to 9741 h eq 6 the wavelet coefficient w t s of a time series f t with duration t is defined as the convolution of f t with wavelet ψ s t at scale s and time t 7 w t s μ f t 1 s ψ t μ s dt where μ is the translating parameter which indicates the region of interest and the asterisk denotes the convolution between the time series signal and the wavelet basis mallat 1998 the wavelet power spectrum is defined as w t s 2 and the energy of scale s can be calculated as 8 e t 1 t w t s 2 each time series of soil water content was transformed into a wavelet coefficient matrix w t s using the cwtft function in matlab released 2011a the mathworks inc the inverse function icwtft was applied to reconstruct the signals into individual scale components by using only the coefficients of the selected scale and setting the coefficients of all other scales equal to zero thus each reconstructed signal became 50 scaled components that were independent from each other fig 1a the sum of all scale components reconstructs a data series similar to the original soil water content time series which was confirmed by the small value of the average root mean square error 0 006 cm3 cm 3 of all the reconstructed soil water content time series matlab codes associated with wavelet decomposition are available upon request 2 3 2 clustering in this study clustering refers to grouping i e summing of a pre determined number of original scale components c d t n into group components c d t g fig 1b this step was taken to reduce the number of transfer coefficients either derived from linear regression during model development or predicted from multivariate linear regression in the prediction model introduced later 9 c d t g n i n j c d t n g 1 g where i and j are indices of the first and the last scale components of a group g is the group component index and g is the total number of group components in a clustering scenario fig 2 for time series of soil water contents measured at a depth closest to the soil surface 5 or 10 cm in this study the subscript top is used instead of d i e c top t g see table a1 for a list of symbols 2 3 3 derivation of transfer coefficients for scale group components one of the hypothesis of this work is that temporal changes in water content at given scales transfer linearly with depth thus linear regression was used to derive transfer coefficients between zero mean decomposed scale components of each scale fig 1c 10 c d t n a d n c top t n where c top t n and c d t n are the nth components derived from measurements at the surface and at a depth d respectively and a d n represents a transfer coefficient from the soil surface to the depth d the zero intercept in eq 10 is a result of using zero mean decomposed components features in a scale component were assumed to either transfer from surface to a depth d a d n 0 or vanish before reaching that depth a d n 0 one negative a d n value was set to zero because there was no linear relationship between the scale components transfer coefficients for group components a d g were obtained in the same way as individual scale components but using group components c d t g instead of c d t n fig 1c 11 c d t g a d g c top t g 2 3 4 prediction of scale group components from fitted transfer coefficients one essential step in the development of a prediction model is to use the transfer coefficients derived with eqs 10 or 11 to obtain subsurface scale c d t n or group c d t g components from the corresponding surface components i e c top t n or c top t g according to fig 1d 12 c d t n a d n c top t n 13 c d t g a d g c top t g 2 3 5 reconstruction of soil water content signals soil water content at depth d and time t θ d t was estimated by adding the average water content at that depth θ d calculated over the period used for the wavelet analysis table 1 to the sum of predicted scale eq 12 or group eq 13 components from each scenario fig 1e 14 θ d t θ d n

of the prediction model and to understand the most important scales related to the temporal dynamics of soil water content the formulation of a prediction model requires the estimation of transfer coefficients and mean soil water contents at the corresponding depths the approach taken in this research was to predict transfer coefficients a d g from soil properties fig 1f including optimized hydraulic properties and to estimate mean soil water content θ d from few randomly sampled data from the measured time series the prediction model was developed with group components clustering 5 g 5 in eq 15 was selected based on the evaluation of the performance of all clustering scenarios in relation to predictions with eq 14 see section 2 5 multivariable linear regression models were built using spss released 2007 version 16 0 spss inc for estimation of transfer coefficients a d g from several predictors selected from a pool of available properties table 3 for each set of five fitted a d g values two variables that were most significantly correlated with fitted a d g but not correlated with each other were selected as initial predictors stepwise linear regression as implemented in spss was used to select other predictors with f to enter and f to remove set at p 0 05 and p 0 1 respectively finally correlations among predictors selected by the stepwise regression procedure were tested to eliminate multicollinearity by removing the less significant of two correlated predictors at p 0 01 fig 1f in this work an approach similar to the bootstrap and random combination sampling procedure introduced by wang et al 2008 was used to estimate mean soil water content at depth d θ d the method does not require the assumption of normality in the distribution of soil water contents and has an accuracy comparable to other techniques that require larger sample sizes wang et al 2008 a total of 176 data series each containing annual data for a given depth and location were used to estimate θ d by selecting at random soil water content measurements taken between 8 00 am to 6 00 pm as a way of simulating manual sampling the effect of sample size on θ d was evaluated by increasing the number of measurements included in a sample from 1 to 50 in increments of 1 the sampling process was repeated 1000 times for each sample size and the appropriate sample size was identified as the

structure of the model i e clustering scale components into group components and assuming a linear relationship between surface and subsurface group components these errors were assessed individually using the difference in the sum of squared errors sse between predictions with and without a given error source normalized by the former sse values the error percentile introduced by the estimation of mean soil water content e θ d is 19 e θ d 100 sse θ mp sse θ mp sse θ mp where sse θ mp is the sum of squared errors calculated using predictions with eq 16 and observations that included the mean value of the data series and sse θ mp is calculated in the same way but with zero mean predictions and observations obtained by subtracting the mean value of the observation data from each measurement the remaining error in predictions with eq 16 are caused by the estimation of a d g the clustering the scale components and by assuming linear relationships between surface and subsurface group components e a d g c lr values of a d g used in eq 16 were derived from soil properties while the values of a d g in clustering 5 scenario were fitted using observations eq 11 therefore the difference between predictions with eq 16 and clustering 5 scenario can be used to evaluate the influence of a d g e a d g on e a d g c lr 20 e a d g 100 sse θ mp sse θ 5 sse θ mp where s s e θ 5 is the sum of squared errors calculated using zero mean predictions from clustering 5 scenario and zero mean observations the remaining errors in eq 16 that could not be explained by e θ d or e a d g were considered as errors introduced by model structure i e clustering and linear fitting e c lr zero mean predictions from no clustering and clustering 5 were used to calculate the percentage of error introduced by clustering the scale components into group components e c 21 e c 100 sse θ 5 sse θ 50 sse θ 5 where sse θ 50 is the sum of squared errors of zero mean predictions with the no clustering

into nine of the textural classes defined in the usda soil texture classification table 2 the only classes that were not represented were silt silty clay loam and silty clay sandy loam and sand had the largest representations with 10 and 8 horizons respectively overall there was a predominance of the sand fraction in the studied soils fig 3 and the three horizons at site s2013 were the only ones classified as clay textural composition remained relatively constant with depth except for three sites in which the clay s2013 or sand nj295 and nj284 size fractions increased with depth these textural changes particularly over a short distance may alter water flow and hinder the performance of the wavelet based model because of potential decoupling in water movement between the surface and subsurface mean soil water contents θ d were negatively correlated to sand r2 0 356 data not shown the largest deviation in this relationship was observed in a thin iron cemented horizon with a well defined abrupt boundary found between 126 and 128 cm below the surface at site nj295 fig 3 this cemented horizon has similar texture to horizons above and below it but it has a massive structure that resulted in greater θ d and smaller optimized ks values than expected from its sand content table 2 although no historical records indicated groundwater impacts to the study profiles there were several unexpected increases of subsurface soil water content that were not observed in the overlying horizons such at sites s2049 s2013 s2027 s2009 and nj295 supplemental material fig c3 changes in subsurface soil water content with no correspondence at shallower depths are a potential limitation to the analysis proposed in this work soil hydraulic parameters for each horizon were optimized by fitting soil water content observations using the dream zs algorithm to run hydrus 1d tables 1 and 2 most model predictions using optimized parameters had a coefficient of determination r 2 greater than 0 78 except for site s2012 where surface observations 5 cm and 10 cm have smaller fluctuations than in the subsurface deeper than 10 cm despite the fact that the texture of the soil profile is sand and sites s2049 and s2013 both containing increases in water content at 100 cm that were not connected with surface processes when grouped by textural classes most values of the optimized parameters were within the range defined by the mean standard deviation of the corresponding textural class values given by schaap and leij 1998 suggesting that the estimated parameters are reasonable fig 4 optimized parameters for the textural class sand deviated the most from the range reported by schaap and leij 1998 values of optimized θ r and n vg were smaller than the lower boundary of the range and values of a had a larger spread than the range for sand during optimization values of θ r were forced to be smaller than the smallest observed value of soil water content which may have influenced the values of parameters a and n vg values of k s from the three horizons classified as clay were noticeably larger than the upper bound in schaap and leij 1998 these three horizons were in site s2013 and had extreme fluctuations in soil water content at 100 cm that may have induced larger estimated values of k s needed to simulate the observed rapid changes fig c3 considering all horizons estimated ks did not show a clear relationship with soil texture fig 4 or root distribution data not shown but within a profile values dropped more than one order of magnitude table 2 for horizons with smaller variations in soil water content values than the adjacent horizons e g nj 295 at 127 cm and nj 284 at 221 cm and 302 cm fig c3 3 2 analysis of soil water content measurements the wavelet power spectrum w t s 2 estimated by squaring the wavelet coefficient eq 7 represents the time frequency distribution of energy of a signal fig 5 b d in general the power spectra of all the sites had multiple high frequency features that were non periodic and were contained between scales 0 h and 256 h also most of the energy e eq 8 of the soil water content signals were concentrated on scales between 256 h and 4096 h followed by scales larger than 4096 h fig 5e g these high frequency power features are typically synchronized with precipitation events lauzon et al 2004 and are visible mainly at near surface soil water content measurements fig 5 at deeper horizons high frequency features appeared when water content in the soil profile was close to saturation which typically occurred during the winter although there was one exception to this in late august 2011 during hurricane irene when a cumulative rainfall of 184 mm was recorded at the site during 24 h starting at noon august 27 this produced an increase in water content detected by the sensor placed at about 270 cm that appeared as a high frequency peak in the wavelet power spectrum fig 5d in addition periodic power features were mainly found at scales between 861 h and 4096 h with the strongest one occurring approximately every six months 2048 h note that scales longer than 9741 h were not considered because inferences were affected by edge effects related to the length of the record used see cone of influence in fig 5 decoupling of the power spectra at progressively greater depths may occur when a layer or horizon alters water movement for instance the iron cemented layer found at 127 cm in site nj295 fig 5c had a distinctively different pattern of wavelet power spectrum than horizons above and below it mean information gain h g and fluctuation complexity σ γ 2 of soil water content measurements were calculated for daily averages to circumvent the possible confounding effect of noise in hourly measurements of water content in general values of h g and σ γ 2 averaged by depth for the scan sites decreased with depth observation in fig 6 which agrees with results reported by pan et al 2011 this indicates that time series of soil water content at the surface are characterized by greater randomness and a more complex data structure pachepsky et al 2006 this is also evident in the presence of more frequent non periodic features in the power spectra of surface signals fig 5 3 3 soil water content prediction with transfer coefficients transfer coefficients a d n in eq 10 were fitted using the scale components from surface and subsurface water contents in order to predict subsurface scale components most values of a d n were between 0 and 1 which means that energy was damped when transferred from the surface to the subsurface this is particularly true at scales smaller than 45 h fig 7 a which implies that non periodic features tend not to penetrate deeper into the soil fig 5 there were instances in which the values of a d n were greater than 1 which would imply that energy increased in magnitude with depth fig 7a the possible cause of this phenomenon could be internal water redistribution from horizons above or below the horizon of interest generally values of a d n greater than 1 were observed at scale components larger than about 300 h likely because water redistribution could be a slow process values of a d n greater than 1 2 were obtained for scales larger than 300 h at sites s2013 and s2009 100 cm and nj284 50 cm temporal variation of soil water content at 100 cm in s2013 and s2009 exhibited periodic patterns of unknown origin that did not show at the soil surface and the horizon at 50 cm in site nj284 has continuous tubular pores joseph et al 2010 which may have contributed to larger magnitudes of soil water fluctuation in this horizon fig c3 soil water contents were estimated with eq 14 by adding average values of measured soil water contents at depth d θ d to the sum of all 50 scales components this is considered to be the best possible prediction scenario because it is a full reconstruction using all the scales and a d n values were obtained using subsurface scales components c d t n derived from measurements no clustering in figs 7 and 8 most predictions using all scale components had a nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse greater than 0 4 which indicates a satisfactory prediction for hourly data foglia et al 2009 moriasi et al 2007 horizons with lower nse values typically at 100 cm in scan sites included rapid fluctuations of water content occurring outside the growing season and apparently disconnected from water content fluctuations at the surface fig 8 another exception was site nj295 where decoupling between surface and bottom horizons was likely caused by the iron cemented layer found between 126 and 128 cm below the surface fig 8g values of h g and σ γ 2 obtained with the predictions using 50 scales components compared well with the values of h g and σ γ 2 of the measured water contents compare no clustering with observation in fig 8 except for those horizons containing data with unexplained trends as described above i e s2013 at 100 cm fig 8c and s2009 at 50 cm and 100 cm fig 8e this provides further indication that the model is not applicable when decoupling between surface and subsurface water contents takes place 3 4 soil water content prediction with group components scale components were clustered using eq 9 to reduce the number of transfer coefficients a d n estimated with eq 10 to a number of transfer coefficients a d g varying between 1 and 5 eq 11 values of a d g were derived using the group components from surface and subsurface soil water contents following 5 scenarios described in fig 2 in all clustering cases water contents were calculated with eqs 14 and 15 by adding the same values of θ d derived using all measurements values of h g and σ γ 2 fig 8 were used to evaluate clustering scenarios because these measures allow the comparison of information content and data structure of predictions across all clustering scenarios grouping the 50 scale components into one group clustering 1 is equivalent to the linear regression approach that uses measured water content at the surface without wavelet decomposition kostov and jackson 1993 thus transferring the same information to the subsurface regardless of depth or frequency this is evident by the values of h g and σ γ 2 that remained constant with depth because a single transfer coefficient was used when more than one group was used h g and σ γ 2 tended to decrease with depth and to follow the values of h g and σ γ 2 obtained with measured data observation in figs 6 and 8 and fig 8 values of h g and σ γ 2 from predictions using five groups clustering 5 and fifty scales no clustering were similar at all sites while predictions with two clustering 2 three clustering 3 and four clustering 4 groups were not always consistent with trends of no clustering fig 8 values of bic were in accordance with the results from h g and σ γ 2 the best and the second best predictions varied between no clustering and clustering 5 scenario for 26 out of 30 depths no clustering scenario was the best model for 16 out of 30 depths and clustering 5 scenario had the smallest bic values for the remaining 10 depths fig 8 considering the advantage of reducing the number of transfer coefficients from 50 no clustering to 5 clustering 5 the clustering 5 model was selected to develop the prediction model notably the use of nse did not help distinguishing among different clustering scenarios fig 8 3 5 prediction model 3 5 1 estimation of transfer coefficients a d g and mean water content θ d correlations between soil properties table 3 and fitted a d g values of the five group components of clustering 5 scenario were explored in an attempt to understand controls exerted by the soil profile on the temporal changes of subsurface soil water content fig 9 properties most significantly p 0 01 correlated with a d g varied with the group components non transformed and log transformed effective saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity values were positively correlated to the a d g values of the first three group components which altogether cover from 2 h to about 85 days 2048 h this result suggests that the transfer of water pulses from the surface deep into the soil profile facilitated by relatively large hydraulic conductivity values tends to preserve the properties of the signal on the other hand soil properties most correlated to the a d g values of groups 4 and 5 fig 9 which cover scales from approximately 90 days 2436 h to more than one year 9741 h were those derived from texture all parameters representing particle diameter were negatively correlated while clay content was positively correlated with a d g values this implies that low frequency signals are preserved at depth by fine textured soils likely because of their greater water retention capacity multivariable linear regression was conducted to investigate soil properties that could be used to predict a d g for each of the five groups fig 10 variables in the model of each group included the two variables found to be most correlated to the a d g of that group fig 9 as long as they were not correlated with each other the two most important properties in these models were effective saturated hydraulic conductivity k s e and the median particle size d50 defined in table 3 more than 90 of the predicted a d g values were within 0 4 of the fitted a d g values derived from observations using clustering 5 scenario although predictions of greater values were more common 55 than the opposite case fig 10 these results were derived from a limited number of observations and are not considered sufficiently robust to be used for predictive purposes nevertheless they indicate that values of a d g could be predicted with acceptable accuracy from basic soil properties the use of pedotransfer functions to predict hydraulic conductivities should be investigated in this context mean values of water content θ d were estimated from 10 random samples per year fig c2 the values of θ d were within observed mean value θ d 0 05 cm3 cm 3 in 92 of the time series considered while using 6 random samples per year reduced that number to 78 these results are comparable to the ones reported by tague et al 2010 who proposed 15 samples with an accuracy of 0 03 cm3 cm 3 exceptions were time series that had large standard deviations i e observations at 5 cm in s2008 and at 100 cm in s2013 fig c3 and required between 10 and 51 samples per year extremely large values of soil water content at 100 cm in s2013 were concentrated in the winter time and shifted the values of mean soil water content upwards suggesting that the proper sampling scheme should consider seasonal variations and cannot be properly captured with purely random sampling considering all soil horizons values of θ d estimated from 10 random samples year were within 0 015 cm3 cm 3 of the measured values 3 5 2 soil water content prediction with estimated a d g and θ d in general prediction of water content model pred see fig 11 using estimated values of a d g resulted in time series with similar values of hg and larger values of σ γ 2 than those derived with clustering 5 scenario figs 6 and 8 which used fitted a d g deviations between these two types of predictions tended to be small at depths close to the measured soil water content used as reference effects of estimated a d g on the characteristics of the predicted soil water content signals can be better discerned by looking at cases where estimated a d g of all five groups are either larger or smaller than values of fitted a d g derived with clustering 5 scenario which altogether represented about 43 of the cases considered over prediction of all five values of a d g at 50 cm in both s2049 and s2013 sites fig 10 resulted in a signal with greater values of hg and σ γ 2 than the corresponding prediction with clustering 5 fig 8a and c on the other hand under prediction of a d g at 100 cm in the same sites derived in final predicted signals with similar or slightly smaller hg and σ γ 2 than those in clustering 5 fig 8a and c notably signals at depth 207 cm and 302 cm in nj284 with very low standard deviations 0 007 and 0 008 also had large discrepancies in the values of hg and σ γ 2 between the two methods possibly because small variations in the predictions could introduce large differences in data structure overall predictions with model pred resulted in nse values greater than 0 4 fig 8 which is considered satisfactory for hourly predictions foglia et al 2009 moriasi et al 2007 negative nse values were computed at depths 207 cm and 302 cm of site nj284 indicating that the predictions were worse than using the mean value to represent the signals likely due to the low standard deviations of these measurements 3 6 error analysis of prediction model the major sources of error in the prediction model model pred were introduced by the assumption that surface and subsurface components are linearly related e lr and by the estimation of a d g from soil properties e a d g the errors contributed by the estimation of θ d e θ d were relatively small and those introduced by clustering e c were the smallest of all the sources considered fig 12 values of e θ d were less than 20 of the total sum of squared errors of the predictions with model pred in 29 of the 30 depths considered and less than 5 at 22 depths the one exception was at site s2049 10 cm with 53 errors explained by θ d fig 12a that depth site had the largest error in the estimation of θ d among all estimated values of θ d in this study 0 015 cm3 cm 3 the error not accounted by e θ d was caused by the other mentioned sources e a d g c lr estimation of a d g introduced less than 45 of e a d g c lr whereas the remaining portion of the error 55 was caused by model structure e c lr except at 2 depths of site nj284 where values of e c lr were relatively small fig 12b less than 5 of e c lr was the result of the clustering process e c whereas the largest error in the wavelet based regression model was caused mainly by the linear fitting e lr fig 12c it should be noted that e lr might also contain errors from unknown sources such as measurement errors that occur at the surface and are transferred to the subsurface and information loss from wavelet decomposition of surface observations the uncertainty derived from each of the steps in the prediction model was not estimated in this work in part because a meaningful analysis should include a larger database with more representation of other soils and geographic regions nevertheless the analysis of the different components of the errors suggest that the largest uncertainty stem from the use of a linear function to connect surface and subsurface group components and that other functions should be investigated estimation of a d g needs to be further improved by incorporating a greater range of soil textures and possibly landscape properties such as topography and land use 4 conclusions this study shows that wavelet based regression models can predict temporal variations of subsurface soil water content from surface measurements the performance of the model worsens with depth particularly in the presence of discontinuities in the soil profile that could potentially decouple surface and subsurface signals one of the advantages of using wavelets decomposition of time series of soil water content is the identification of soil properties correlated to changes in soil water content at different temporal scales which could improve the understanding of processes such as soil water redistribution and preferential flow the availability of datasets of water contents for different soil types offers an opportunity to derive the parameters of this model at the regional scale and to further investigate methods to predict mean soil water content and the relationships between the decomposed components from surface and subsurface moreover soil water content estimated from microwave remotely sensed data could be used to predict distributions of subsurface water content at the landscape scale acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge support from the new jersey department of environmental protection through

measured and predicted soil water contents were converted to binary signals by replacing soil water content values larger and smaller than the median with the values of 1 and 0 respectively window lengths of two were considered in this study which means that states 00 01 10 11 are possible with indices i or j 1 2 3 4 respectively pachepsky et al 2006 in a given sequence of states p i or p j is the probability for the ith or jth state defined as the occurrence frequency of i th or j th state in the sequence p i j is the conditional probability of the occurrence of j th state after the i th
