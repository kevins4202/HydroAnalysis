19745,engineered nanoparticles nps are often doped with other elements to improve their functionality and at times physical and or chemical stability however the effect of doping on the environmental implications of nps is not well understood we investigated the colloidal stability and effects of cuo nps doped with fe 0 10 colloidal stability of the fe doped cuo nps in aqueous media as determined by critical coagulation concentrations of nacl decreased with increased fe doping however decrease in the overall particle density led to slower sedimentation of fe doped cuo nps than would have been predicted from their aggregation behavior fe doping significantly affected cuo dissolution p 001 promoting cu leaching out from the doped nps due to increased reactivity at neutral ph and increased surface area with fe doping fe doping did not increase the toxicity of cuo to a marine phytoplankton isochrysis galbana despite promoting ionic cu release total suspended cu was dominated by dissolved cu complexes in seawater and particulate cu in freshwater based on the abundance of different size fractions analyzed in freshwater the particles detected in water suspension were mostly 50 larger than 200 nm in diameter however these large sized particles are mainly composed of aggregated nanosized particles held together by van der waals attraction graphical abstract image 1 keywords copper oxide nanoparticle natural waters environmental fate toxicity transformation 1 introduction several applications of engineered nanoparticles nps require that they are combined with other materials which may be mere matrices or co primary ingredients the use of these nanocomposites has been widely reported in the literature adeleye et al 2016b de volder et al 2013 wagner 2007 wang et al 2011a in addition the composition of nps may be intentionally modified to form nanohybrids doped nps or composites in order to improve their functionality or reduce unwanted properties fairbairn et al 2011 wang et al 2011a xia et al 2011 for instance one of the primary applications of copper nps is in electronics and optics keller et al 2013 and the incorporation of small amounts of fe enhances the applications of cuo in magnetic storage devices keller et al 2013 yin et al 2010 doped nps have wide applications in fields including medicine biotechnology energy environmental science etc and their uses include chemical sensing biological imaging catalysis and environmental remediation adeleye et al 2016a chen et al 2004 thakar et al 2007 wang et al 2011a however doping may also influence the physicochemical properties of the nps and thus their environmental implications fairbairn et al 2011 xia et al 2011 for instance the dissolution and toxicity of zno nps were significantly reduced when they were doped with fe fairbairn et al 2011 recently several studies focused on the environmental implications of copper based nps due to the toxicity of copper and the increasing application of copper nps in consumer products adeleye 2015 adeleye et al 2016b ingle et al 2014 keller et al 2017 midander et al 2009 wang et al 2013 zhao et al 2016b most of these studies however researched single elements e g cu nps or common compounds of copper e g cuo nps while these studies provide knowledge useful for predicting the environmental hazard of the basic nps a good understanding of the fate and transformation of doped nps nanocomposites and nanohybrids is necessary since nanomaterials are often used and will be introduced into the environment in these forms studies investigating the fate of doped nps are currently rare in order to exhaustively investigate how the human health and environmental implications of nps may be influenced by doping them our research consortium synthesized cuo nps doped with fe 0 10 using flame spray pyrolysis techniques the fate and effects of the pure cuo and fe doped cuo nps were then carefully studied in the two important systems biological and environmental in a recently published article summarizing the finding in biological media naatz and coworkers reported that fe doping of cuo reduced the release of toxic cu ions in biological media naatz et al 2017 this article reports our findings on the environmental implications of the same pure and fe doped cuo nps the aggregation dissolution and transformation of the nps were thoroughly investigated in both simple aqueous media and natural waters furthermore the nps were exposed to an axenic marine phytoplankton culture in order to determine their potential toxicity to this important class of organisms 2 experimental section 2 1 nanoparticle synthesis the synthesis of pure and fe doped cuo nps was carried out using in house built flame spray pyrolysis george et al 2010 kemmler et al 2013 pokhrel et al 2010 copper naphthenate strem chemical 99 9 pure was used as a precursor with or without iron napthenate 12 fe by metal strem 99 9 pure all the precursors were diluted with xylene strem chemicals 99 95 pure to obtain a total metal concentration of 0 5 m to synthesize the library of cuo doped with 0 2 6 and 10 fe hereafter referred to as 0 fe cuo 2 fe cuo 6 fe cuo and 10 fe cuo respectively a 50 ml portion of 0 5 m copper naphthenate was separately mixed with 1 15 5 7 ml of 0 5 m iron naphthenate each liquid precursor was delivered to the nozzle tip by a syringe pump at a flow rate of 5 ml min by atomising the precursor solution with dispersant o2 at a flow rate of 5 ml min and maintaining a pressure drop of 1 5 bar at the nozzle tip combustion of the dispersed droplets was initiated by the co delivery of ch4 and o2 1 5 l min 3 2 l min to sustain a flame the particles were collected from the 257 mm glass filters placed at a distance of 60 cm from the nozzle commercially available cuo nps denoted cuo sa were obtained from sigma aldrich to compare with the one synthesized in house i e 0 fe cuo in addition cu and cu2o nps denoted ncu and ncu2o respectively were obtained from us nanomaterials houston tx to understand how the fate of the synthesized library of pure and fe doped cuo nps compare with these other copper based nps 2 2 x ray diffraction and brunauer emmet teller surface area analyses for the x ray diffraction measurements the nps 0 10 fe doped cuo were loaded into a bruker d8 diffracting system the diffractometer was configured in bragg brentano geometry equipped with a primary johansson monochromator producing ni filtered cu kα λ 0 154 nm radiation a 0 1 fixed divergence 4 primary 2 5 secondary soller slits and lynxeye detector position sensitive in a range of 3 2θ with 192 channels yielding a channel width of 0 01563 2θ was used dreyer et al 2016 pokhrel et al 2015 continuous scans were applied with an integration step width of 0 03 2θ and 30 s per step the determination of the average crystallite sizes d xrd was achieved by the line broadening analysis during the rietveld refinement of the x ray patterns the instrumental contribution to the peak broadening was corrected using lab6 as an instrumental standard the adsorption desorption isotherms of nitrogen brunauer emmett teller bet were measured at 77 k using a quantachrome nova 4000e and autosorb 1 gas sorption system as a function of relative pressure p po over the range of 0 01 0 99 prior to the measurement the sample was outgassed at 200 c under vacuum to determine the specific surface areas the pore volume was estimated from the nitrogen uptake at p po 0 99 data were obtained by exposing or removing a known quantity of adsorbing gas in or out of a sample cell containing the solid adsorbent maintained at constant liquid nitrogen temperature 2 3 transmission electron microscopy the nps 2 5 mg were dispersed in absolute ethanol followed by ultrasonication for 1 h a drop from the resulting dispersion was placed on a transmission electron microscopy tem grid using an eye dropper and dried at room temperature high resolution transmission electron microscopy images hrtem were obtained using a fei titan 80 300 microscope equipped with a cs corrector for the objective lens high angle annular dark field detector haadf gatan post column imaging filter and a cold field emission gun operated at an accelerating voltage of 300 kv 2 4 particle surface charge the surface charge of the nps was estimated by measuring their zeta ζ potential using a zetasizer zs90 malvern uk for ζ potential measurements stocks of the particles were prepared in deionized di water barnstead nanopure 18 2 mω cm aliquots were taken from the stock to prepare samples 50 mg l in freshwater ph 7 1 the freshwater was made in accordance with epa method 1003 0 with 1 mg c l suwannee river natural organic matter srnom adeleye and keller 2014 epa 2002 ζ potential was not measured in seawater due to the high ionic strength which burns out zeta cells during measurements additional measurements were carried out in di water at several ionic strength conditions 0 10 and 50 mm nacl at ph 5 5 2 mm acetate buffer and ph 8 2 2 mm carbonate buffer the isoelectric point iep of the particles in 1 mm nacl was determined by adjusting ph with dilute hcl and naoh 0 01 0 1 mm and measuring ζ potential using the zetasizer multiple samples were used for titrations to different ph values so as to minimized the amounts of titrants used and thus changes in ionic strength of the nanoparticle suspensions 2 5 aggregation kinetics the critical coagulation concentrations ccc of nacl were determined for the synthesized pure and fe doped cuo nps as described previously adeleye et al 2014 adeleye and keller 2014 and summarized in supplementary information si section a1 for the analyses particle concentration was 50 mg l while ph was held at either 5 5 acetate buffer or 8 2 carbonate buffer with or without srnom 1 mg c l aggregation was studied at 20 c via time resolved dynamic light scattering dls using the zetasizer data were collected in triplicates at 30 s intervals for 1 h or until the hydrodynamic diameter was double the initial value for comparison the ccc of nacl was also determined for cuo sa and ncu2o in similar conditions as the pure and fe doped cuo nps the ccc of nacl was not determined for ncu due to the particle s high polydispersity and poor stability in aqueous media adeleye et al 2014 conway et al 2015 2 6 dissolution sedimentation and transformations the dissolution of all the nps was studied in conditions simulating the surface of natural waters 14 10 light dark 6000 lux 140 rpm bennett et al 2013 temperature was held constant at 20 c throughout the study which was carried out at two initial particle concentrations low 500 μg l and high 5 mg l initial volume was 300 ml and all experimental conditions were tested in triplicates aliquots for sampling were removed from the top 1 cm of the aqueous phase thus only dissolved ions and suspended particles were collected for analyses to reduce the possibility of contamination from metal leaching glassware was avoided in this study and all pipette tips were acid leached prior to use containers were either certified metal free vwr international radnor pa or acid leached before use 2 6 1 low concentrations studies these experiments were carried out to estimate the fate of the nps at concentrations similar to what is expected in the natural waters low ppb dissolved 100 nm and 200 nm cu fractions present in the aqueous phase were estimated similar to the method used in a previous study adeleye et al 2016b in brief dissolved fractions were separated from the particulate fractions with millipore amicon ultra 4 3 kda centrifugal filter tubes which retains particles greater than 1 5 nm the 100 nm fraction diameter 1 100 nm was defined as the fraction that passed through a 0 1 μm filter whatman uk accounting for the dissolved fraction 200 nm fractions diameter 100 200 nm were determined by subtracting the dissolved and 100 nm fractions from the fraction obtained by filtering with 0 2 μm filters thermo scientific waltham ma particles greater than 200 nm were defined as bulk in addition aliquots were measured without filtration to determine total suspended cu dissolved particulate cu was quantified via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms using an agilent 7900 icp ms santa clara ca the detection limit ranged from 0 005 μg l in clean water to 0 96 μg l in high salt matrix dissolved fe was not measured as preliminary studies conducted in freshwater and seawater showed no significant leaching of fe from the fe doped cuo nps at the concentrations tested single particle icp ms spicp ms was also used to confirm the presence of nanosized cu fractions throughout the study using the agilent 7900 icp ms adeleye et al 2016b sp icp ms analyses were performed in time resolved analysis tra mode using an integration time of 0 1 ms per point with no settling time between measurements nist 8012 au reference material nominal diameter 30 nm was employed for determination of plasma s nebulization efficiency a nist traceable cu standard concentration 1 μg l was used to determine the elemental response factor method setup and data analyses were carried out in the single nanoparticle application module icp ms masshunter software agilent technologies santa clara ca this study was conducted for 14 d in both epa freshwater and seawater seawater was collected from the pacific ocean at santa barbara ca and filtered 0 2 μm before use only 0 fe cuo and 10 fe cuo were used for this study background cu in freshwater and seawater was not detectable 2 6 2 high concentration studies this study was carried out at the ppm range 5 mg l to allow for more precise detection of the different fractions dissolved 100 nm and 200 nm of cu from the nps via filtration techniques coupled with icp ms as explained earlier this study was conducted for 30 d using the four synthesized pure and fe doped cuo nps 0 2 6 and 10 fe and the three commercial nps in epa freshwater particles in the aliquots collected from the supernatants of samples on days 0 and 30 were visualized using a fei tecnai g2 sphera 200 kv tem equipped with an oxford inca x sight probe for energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds 2 7 toxicity to marine phytoplankton the influence of fe doping on the potential ecological effects of cuo nps was investigated by studying the toxicity of 0 fe cuo and 10 fe cuo to isochrysis galbana phytoplankton are primary producers in aquatic systems and are typically used to evaluate the environmental impacts of chemicals including those that are copper based in both freshwater and marine systems axenic cultures were obtained from the national center for marine algae and microbiota bigelow laboratory for ocean sciences east boothbay harbor me and were maintained in standard media f 2 made with 0 2 μm filtered natural seawater as described previously adeleye et al 2016b inoculants were cultured for 5 7 d and initial cell density was kept at 2 3x104 cells ml all experiments were conducted at 20 c 34 ppt salinity under cool white fluorescent lights 14 10 light dark 6000 lux for 5 d cell densities were measured every 24 h using a trilogy fluorometer turner designs sunnyvale ca using in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence as a surrogate in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence was converted to cell numbers using a calibration curve based on cell counts done with a hemacytometer reichert buffalo ny experiments were run in 125 ml polycarbonate flasks media volume 80 ml and were mixed at 120 rpm on a rotary shaker new brunswick scientific nj to allow for gas exchange through the filter covered vents in flask caps additional experiments were conducted using cuo sa in order to compare its effects with that of 0 fe cuo each particle was tested in triplicate at 0 0 05 0 1 1 5 and 10 mg l exposure concentration adverse effects of the nps were assessed via growth inhibition and reactive oxygen species ros production 2 7 1 growth inhibition the average specific growth rate of the algae for the duration of exposure was calculated according to the following logistic equation 1 μ i j ln x i ln x j t i t j d a y 1 where μ i j is the average specific growth rate from time i to j x i and x j are the cell densities at time i and j respectively and t i and t j are the initial time of exposure and final time of exposure respectively percentage inhibition of growth was calculated as 2 i μ c μ t μ c 100 where i is the percent inhibition in average specific growth rate μ c is the average specific growth rate in the control group and μ t is the average specific growth rate for the treatment 2 7 2 cellular reactive oxygen species ros to investigate whether the cells of i galbana were in oxidative stress upon their exposure to the nps total ros level was quantified after 5 d total ros produced in the organisms was assessed by incubating the cells in black 96 well plates containing carboxy 2 7 dichloro dihydro fluorescein diacetate h2dcfda probe invitrogen molecular probe eugene or in the dark for 45 min at 20 c h2dcfda can diffuse freely across cells membranes and is popularly used as an indicator for ros ros in the cells promote the oxidation of h2dcfda to yield the fluorescent product 2 7 dichlorofluorescein dcf hong et al 2009 ivask et al 2015 the intensity of dcf fluorescence in the cells was measured at 485 nm excitation and 530 nm emission using a synergy h1 microplate reader biotek instruments winooski vt the assay was performed for each of the triplicates cultures with each culture measured a minimum of four times np only controls were also measured ros levels were evaluated according to equation 3 hong et al 2009 3 r r f t f c 100 where rr is relative ros level ft is the mean dcf fluorescence of np treated cells and fc is the mean dcf fluorescence of control cells 3 results and discussions 3 1 nanoparticles synthesis and characterization the specific surface areas and bet primary particle sizes d bet of pure and fe doped cuo nps ranged from 81 1 8 to 90 4 5 m2 g and 10 12 nm respectively fig 1 table 1 fe doping did not have much influence on primary particle size and morphology the crystallite sizes extracted from rietveld refinement of the xrd patterns were in the range of 9 12 nm reasonably agreeing with the bet primary particle diameters table 1 the low resolution tem micrographs of pure and fe doped cuo nps showed spherical particles the crystal structure of the nps was studied by probing a single particle via hrtem imaging the images showed single crystalline particles of 0 10 fe cuo nps with well developed lattice fringes the lattice plane distances of 0 2529 0 003 0 2514 0 003 0 2528 0 003 0 2498 0 003 nm were observed for 0 2 6 and 10 fe doped cuo nps respectively fig 1 the xrd patterns show sharp and well resolved reflections indicating a monoclinic system icsd 69757 with a 0 46927 nm b 3 4283 nm c 5 1370 nm α γ 90 and β 99 546 naatz et al 2017 torres duarte et al 2016 increasing fe loading resulted in an increasing peak shift indicating fe incorporation into the cuo lattice fig 2 a peak shift of 0 35 was observed for 10 fe doped cuo across the entire 2θ angles the ionic radii of cu2 is 0 71 å in square planar geometry and it is not possible for fe2 with a much larger ionic radius 0 77 å to substitute cu2 fe3 with a smaller ionic radius 0 63 å can easily substitute cu2 in the lattice hence the oxidation state of fe in the doped cuo nps is most likely 3 raman spectroscopy and electron loss spectroscopy eels analyses confirmed the formation of cufe2o4 in the fe doped of cuo nps naatz et al 2017 the isoelectric point of cufe2o4 was reported as ph 4 1 in a previous study li et al 2015 the amount of fe present in each of the fe cuo nps was confirmed via icp ms and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy table a1 elemental mapping via energy filtered transmission electron microscopy eftem showed that fe and cu appeared to be homogeneously distributed throughout the fe cuo nps at all fe loadings naatz et al 2017 the primary particle size of cuo sa ncu and ncu2o was 50 nm 40 nm and 18 nm respectively the full characterization of cuo sa ncu and ncu2o is presented in table a2 3 2 surface charge measurements at ph 5 5 the ζ potential of the 0 10 fe cuo nps decreased in magnitude became less positive as fe doping increased for instance the ζ potential in 10 mm nacl decreased from 24 1 0 8 mv represents mean standard deviation throughout the manuscript unless otherwise stated for 2 fe cuo to 12 9 0 6 mv for 10 fe cuo fig 3 and fig a1 the addition of 1 mg c l of srnom reversed the ζ potential of the nps from positive to negative at ph 5 5 suggesting a strong attractive interaction between the nps and organic matter in the presence of srnom the ζ potential of the fe cuo nps also decreased in magnitude with increased fe doping but unlike in the absence of srnom when ζ potential became less positive ζ potential was more positive with increased doping in the presence of srnom this behavior suggests the ζ potential of the doped nps shifted towards that of the dopant cufe2o4 ζ potential at ph 5 5 5 2 mv as the amount of the dopant increased with or without srnom present fig 3 the fe cuo nps were negatively charged in epa freshwater ph 7 1 with 1 mg c l srnom fig a2 similar to our observation in simple aqueous media the ζ potential shifted towards that of cufe2o4 ζ potential 8 5 mv at ph 7 as fe doping increased decreasing in magnitude from 24 1 mv in 0 fe cuo to 14 3 mv in 10 fe cuo dissolution of cuo np should occur at ph 5 5 leading to the release of cu2 the adsorption of these positively charged ions onto the surface of the nps could play a role in the measured ζ potential but the influence of the dissolved cu ions is probably small due to the short ζ potential measurement time 3 min the dopant in fe doped cuo cufe2o4 could be chemically unstable at acidic near neutral ph conditions forming cufeo2 and fe2o3 and dissolved metals ding et al 2013 kuan et al 2015 as shown in equations 4 and 5 4 c u f e 2 o 4 s f e 3 a q c u f e o 2 s 4 h 2 o a q 3 e a q 5 c u f e 2 o 4 s 2 h c u 2 a q f e 2 o 3 s h 2 o a q cufeo2 and fe2o3 could subsequently dissolve to form more cu and fe ions as shown in equations 6 8 6 c u f e o 2 s 4 h a q c u a q f e 3 a q 2 h 2 o a q 7 f e 2 o 3 s 2 f e 2 a q 4 e a q 1 5 o 2 a q 8 f e 2 o 3 s 6 h a q 2 f e 3 a q 3 h 2 o a q like in pure cuo nps both the cu and fe ions produced by these reactions can impart more positivity on surface of the fe doped particles if the ions adsorbed onto the surface of the particles as shown in fig 3 however the ζ potential of the fe doped nps became less positive with increased fe doping this suggests that the change in ζ potential due to fe doping was not driven by release of cu and fe ions but by the presence of cufe2o4 in the particles this is again probably due to the short timescale of ζ potential measurements the nps were negatively charged at ph 8 2 which is still below their observed iep table 1 the negative charge is likely due to the adsorption of hydroxyl ion or carbonate ions from the buffer onto the surface of the particles naatz et al also reported negative charges on the surface of the fe doped cuo nps in biological media ph 7 7 due to adsorption of serum albumin present in the media naatz et al 2017 we observed a minimal shift in the ζ potential of the fe cuo nps towards the ζ potential of cufe2o4 at ph 8 2 12 mv with increased fe doping at 50 mm nacl for instance ζ potential decreased in magnitude from 23 3 1 8 mv in 0 fe cuo to 19 0 0 5 mv as fe content increased to 10 the impact of 1 mg c l srnom on the ζ potential of the fe cuo nps at ph 8 2 was minimal as shown in fig 3 which is quite different than the behavior at ph 5 5 this is probably due to similarities in the surface charges of the nps and the organic materials at ph 8 2 which leads to weaker attraction than at ph 5 5 where they have opposite charges regardless the ζ potential of the nps in the presence of srnom at ph 8 2 also shifted towards that of cufe2o4 with increased fe doping cuo sa the commercial cuo nps obtained from sigma aldrich was also positively charged at ph 5 5 14 2 1 9 mv in 10 mm nacl and its charge was also inverted by 1 mg c l srnom 34 7 1 6 mv in 10 mm nacl at ph 8 2 cuo sa was also negatively charged but much more so than all the fe cuo nps ncu2o and ncu were negatively charged at ph 5 5 and 8 2 with or without srnom summarized in fig a1 in general the ζ potential of the fe cuo nps approached the ζ potential of the dopant cufe2o4 with increased doping in both simple aqueous media and natural water although ph ionic strength and srnom also played important roles in determining the surface charge of the doped nps we hypothesized that this impact of doping on the surface charge of doped cuo nps will be observed in other doped nps especially if there is a clear difference in the surface charge of the nps and the dopant 3 3 aggregation kinetics to determine how fe doping affects the colloidal stability of the cuo nps in aqueous media the critical coagulation concentrations ccc of nacl for the particles were determined at ph 5 5 and 8 2 with or without 1 mg c l srnom summarized in fig 4 in general the colloidal stability of the fe cuo nps decreased with increased fe doping at both ph conditions regardless of the presence of srnom this agrees quite well with the trend observed in the ζ potential of the particles which decreased in magnitude as fe content increased in the absence of nom the fe cuo nps were more stable at ph 8 2 where they were negatively charged than at ph 5 5 where they were positively charged for instance the ccc of 2 fe cuo was 10 mm nacl at ph 5 5 and 70 mm nacl at ph 8 2 although the surfaces charges were opposite at the two ph values fig 3 the difference in colloidal stability is due to differences in the magnitude of the charges the ζ potential of the nps exceeded 30 mv at most ph 8 2 conditions except in 50 mm nacl the typical threshold of colloidal stability is 30 mv everett 1988 in addition the reactivity of cuo and fe doped cuo in acidic conditions equations 4 8 which leads to the production of dissolved and particulate cu and fe species may have contributed to the poor stability observed at ph 5 5 the presence of 1 mg c l srnom only led to slight increase in the ccc at ph 8 2 probably due to the aforementioned weaker attractive interactions at ph 5 5 however the ccc increased by an order of magnitude in the presence of the same amount of srnom fig 4c in addition to imparting electrostatic stability nom coating can also interfere with the reactivity of the particles making them more stable at ph 5 5 as shown here similar to pristine cuo fe doped cuo nps followed the classic derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory of colloidal stability in the presence of nacl as ionic strength increased the electrostatic energy barrier was reduced and the attachment efficiency of the fe doped nps increased the role of fe doping on the colloidal stability of fe cuo nps was mainly a direct consequence of the effect of doping on the surface charge of the doped nps thus like most pristine nps the colloidal stability of doped nps may be predictable from the effect of the dopant on the surface charge of the doped nps cuo sa was much less stable than 0 fe cuo at all conditions tested fig 4c and d in fact cuo sa was completely unstable without srnom at ph 5 5 while the ccc of nacl for cuo sa at ph 5 5 was determined as 180 mm nacl when 1 mg c l srnom was present the presence of srnom did not stabilize ncu2o at ph 5 5 fig 4d instability of ncu2o and ncu at ph 5 5 may be due to rapid dissolution of the nps at this ph condition the stability of cuo sa and cu2o improved at ph 8 2 and similar to the fe cuo nps 1 mg c l srnom only slightly improved their stability at this ph condition 3 4 dissolution sedimentation and transformations cuo nps are not very soluble in natural waters adeleye 2015 adeleye et al 2014 conway et al 2015 keller et al 2017 and this study was conducted to determine the influence of fe doping present as cufe2o4 on the dissolution of cuo nps although both dissolved cu and fe species are typically produced during the reactions of cufe2o4 in aqueous media at acidic and near neutral ph conditions equations 4 8 dissolved fe was not detected in our experiments as stated earlier this is probably due to the low amount of fe in the doped nps 10 or less and more importantly the dissolution of fe is more suppressed than the dissolution of cu from cufe2o4 ding et al 2013 kuan et al 2015 this dissolution study was carried out at both relatively low 500 μg l and relatively high 5 mg l np concentrations the low concentration study was conducted in both freshwater ph 7 1 and seawater ph 8 1 although a higher dissolution was expected in the freshwater which had a lower ph equation 5 adeleye et al 2014 kuan et al 2015 the dissolved cu detected in seawater after 14 d was almost double what was found in freshwater this underscores the importance of complexation with aqueous anions in cuo fe doped cuo dissolution the full result and discussions for the low concentration experiment was provided in section a2 and fig a3 a5 in appendix in addition the low concentration study suggested that fe doping improved the dissolution of fe cuo nps to confirm this initial observation additional studies were carried out by exposing all the nps into the epa freshwater at particle concentrations of 5 mg l to allow for clear observation of trends in general we found that dissolved cu was significantly dependent on fe doping p 001 fig 5 a shows that increased fe doping led to higher solubility of fe cuo nps in water although there was no significant difference between the dissolved cu concentration detected in 0 fe cuo and 2 fe cuo after 24 h p 77 6 fe cuo had a higher dissolved cu concentration than 0 fe cuo and 2 fe cuo though not statistically significant with p 56 and 09 respectively dissolution of 10 fe cuo was significantly higher than both 0 fe cuo and 2 fe cuo p 02 for both as well as 6 fe cuo but not significantly with p 64 average dissolved cu concentration in μg l measured 24 h after exposing the nps to freshwater was 19 7 5 6 15 4 0 9 24 0 0 6 and 27 9 1 1 for 0 fe cuo 2 fe cuo 6 fe cuo and 10 fe cuo respectively we observed similar trends up to 30 d with average dissolved cu concentration in μg l of 25 2 0 5 23 5 1 0 33 1 1 3 and 39 8 2 3 for 0 fe cuo 2 fe cuo 6 fe cuo and 10 fe cuo respectively as shown in fig 5b there was a linear relationship between the doping and log10 k diss where k diss was defined as the dissolution rate after 96 h naatz and coworkers recently reported very high dissolution up to 70 within 24 h of fe doped cuo in cell media naatz et al 2017 in addition they found decreased dissolution of cuo with increased fe doping in cell media the dissolution of the fe doped cuo in the cell media were thought to be promoted by a decrease in media ph that resulted from interactions between the nps and carbonate species present in media in contrast they also found dissolved mass ranging from 0 08 0 01 for 0 fe cuo to 1 03 0 46 for 10 fe cuo over 24 h when the nps were exposed to di water their observation in di water agrees with this study conducted in environmental media in which we found 1 low dissolution of pure and fe doped cuo nps dissolved mass ranging from 0 52 0 15 for 0 fe cuo to 0 81 0 03 for 10 fe cuo in freshwater after 24 h and 2 increased dissolution of fe doped cuo with increased fe doping the differences between the dissolution kinetics of the fe cuo nps in environmental and biological media emphasize the need to characterize nanomaterials and their composites in the media of interest to properly predict their fate and effects cufe2o4 is somewhat unstable around ph 7 kuan et al 2015 which can promote leaching of ions especially cu from the doped cuo nps equations 4 6 the promotion of cu ion release is enhanced with increase in the fe doping of cuo content of cufe2o4 we hypothesize that the redox activity of the fe doped cuo nps coupled with increased specific surface area of the fe cuo nps with increased fe doping table 1 led to increased solubility of the fe cuo nps in environmental media the in house prepared cuo 0 fe cuo was more soluble dissolved cu after 24 h 19 7 5 6 μg l in freshwater than the commercial cuo obtained from sigma aldrich cuo sa dissolved cu after 24 h 11 1 1 0 μg l as shown in fig a6 faster dissolution of 0 fe cuo is mainly due to its smaller size 12 nm compared to 50 nm for cuo sa and thus larger surface area 80 9 m2 g compared to 12 3 m2 g for cuo sa in general the statistically significant trend of dissolution for the 7 nps tested in this study based on dissolved cu detected on day 30 normalized by total cu in particle was cu cu2o 10 fe cuo 6 fe cuo 2 fe cuo 0 fe cuo cuo sa fig a6 it is noteworthy that the dissolution rate of the particles may have decreased over time due to saturation since the studies were carried out in a closed system the initial dissolution rate is useful for predicting the behavior in open waters and the trends observed here should be valid for natural systems colloidal stability studies showed that the fe doped cuo nps became less stable with increasing fe doping fig 4 due to the decreasing magnitude of ζ potential fig 3 additionally dissolution increased with fe doping which led to higher concentrations of aqueous cu2 in 6 fe cuo and 10 fe cuo and that could have caused some subtle effects on the electrostatic double layers around these particles further decreasing their colloidal stability in water as such we expected particulate cu suspended in water to decrease with increasing fe doping however we found more suspended cu in these highly doped cuo nps compared to 0 fe cuo and 2 fe cuo fig 5c we hypothesized that the observed slower settling of 6 fe cuo and 10 fe cuo than expected is probably due to decreases in the particle density upon doping with fe since the density of cufe2o4 can be 13 38 less than that of cuo ali et al 2011 the faster settling of 10 fe cuo than 6 fe cuo at the early stage of the experiment suggests that other factors not considered here also play a role in the settling of fe doped cuo and requires further investigation based on the abundance of the different size fractions analyzed the particles detected in water suspensions were mostly 50 larger than 200 nm in diameter fig 5d however as shown in fig 6 these large sized particles are mainly made up of aggregated nanosized particles held together by van der waals attraction tem analyses showed similar morphology of 0 fe cuo after initial exposure to water and after 30 d fig 6a and c however several smaller sized particles were observed in 10 fe cuo after 30 d fig 6b and d in addition to aggregated particles with diameter similar to the 0 fe cuo nps these smaller sized particles suggest disintegration of fe cuo nps or the recrystallization of dissolved ions further studies are needed to confirm either of these hypotheses but the atomic data obtained via eds analyses fig a7 and a8 suggest that cu formed complexes with other anions in water 3 5 toxicity to marine phytoplankton the impact of 0 fe cuo 10 fe cuo and cuo sa for comparison on the growth of i galbana was monitored for 5 d when the cells are in exponential growth phase in general all three particle types had negligible effects on the growth of i galbana fig 7a c and fig a9 effects of nps on algae was estimated as growth inhibition i which showed that the growth of i galbana was either enhanced or inhibited by less than an average of 4 at all the concentrations considered fig 7 d statistically while the np type 0 fe cuo 10 fe cuo or cuo sa had a significant effect on 5 day algal growth rate p 0001 np concentration had no significant effect p 16 more so the interaction of np type and np concentration had no significantly influence on the growth rate of algae in this study p 70 which explains our observation of no serious effects at all the conditions studied the toxicity of cuo nps has often been attributed to dissolved cu ions leaching out of the particles intracellular dissolution of the nps upon uptake by cells or organisms and oxidative stress gomes et al 2011 gunawan et al 2011 ingle et al 2014 torres duarte et al 2016 wang et al 2011b zhao et al 2016a uptake of cuo nps via endocytosis by microalgae is more common in freshwater systems since rapid aggregation and subsequent sedimentation of the nps occur in marine systems perreault et al 2012 wang et al 2011b zhao et al 2016a we reported in a previous study that cuo nps both commercial and in house synthesized aggregated to micrometer scale within minutes of releasing them into a natural seawater consequently leading to more than 60 settling out of aqueous phase within a few hours torres duarte et al 2016 we therefore expected most of the toxicity to the organisms used in this study to emanate from dissolved cu with 10 fe cuo having more effects because of its higher dissolution rate icp ms analyses of aliquots of culture media carried out during toxicity testing on days 1 3 and 5 showed very low dissolved cu concentrations although more dissolution occurred in the fe doped cuo similar to our finding in the dissolution studies as shown in fig a10a dissolved cu concentration was below 0 5 mg l over 5 d at all the concentrations of the nps tested with dissolution rate decreasing with increased particle concentration fig a10b dissolved cu detected in the culture media are predicted to be mostly complexed fig a10c based on modeling using visual minteq 3 1 and complexed cu tend to be less toxic and less catalytic than free cu ions gunawan et al 2011 wang et al 2013 details on visual minteq modeling is provided in section a3 in the appendix cu speciation modeling predicts less than 0 4 dissolved cu at 10 mg l np concentration and a much smaller fraction as cu2 ros production by cuo nps in aqueous media is primarily caused by fenton like chemistry through the cu cu2 redox couple induced by the dissolved cu fraction kuan et al 2015 wang et al 2013 similarly fe species produced by the fe doped cuo nps equations 7 and 8 can also lead to ros production it is therefore not surprising that we did not observe elevation of intracellular ros production in the algal cells when exposed to pure and fe doped cuo nps 0 10 mg l compared to the control conditions fig a11 lack of toxicity to i galbana by pure and fe doped cuo nps at concentrations up to 10 mg l is therefore adduced mainly to slow dissolution and complexation of dissolved cu ions in natural waters in acidic conditions or open waters where more dissolution may occur fe3 produced by the fe doped cuo can catalyze additional production of hydroxyl radical in the presence of uv light equation 9 which may increase the toxicity of the fe doped cuo nps 9 f e 3 h 2 o h v f e 2 o h h 4 conclusions pure and fe doped cuo nps were synthesized by incorporating up to 10 wt fe into the lattice of cuo using flame spray pyrolysis fsp in order to predict the environmental implications of the nps we studied their surface properties colloidal stability dissolution and transformation in natural waters as well as their potential toxicity to phytoplankton we found that with increased doping the surface charge of the fe cuo nps in aqueous media approached the surface charge of the dopant cufe2o4 although ph ionic strength and srnom also played important roles in determining the surface charge the colloidal stability of the fe cuo nps decreased with increased fe doping with or without srnom the presence of srnom improved the stability of the fe cuo nps much more at ph 5 5 than at ph 8 2 fe doping promoted dissolution of fe cuo nps dissolved mass fraction was 0 52 and 0 81 after exposing 0 fe cuo and 10 fe cuo into freshwater for 24 h dissolution decreased with increased nanoparticle concentration there was minimal less than 4 inhibition or enhancement change in the rate of growth of isochrysis galbana cells exposed to up to 10 mg l of pure cuo nps or 10 fe doped cuo nps this reflects the 1 relatively slow dissolution of fe doped cuo nps in the growth media and 2 complexation of most dissolved cu present in the growth media which reduces their toxicity acknowledgment this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation nsf and the

19745,engineered nanoparticles nps are often doped with other elements to improve their functionality and at times physical and or chemical stability however the effect of doping on the environmental implications of nps is not well understood we investigated the colloidal stability and effects of cuo nps doped with fe 0 10 colloidal stability of the fe doped cuo nps in aqueous media as determined by critical coagulation concentrations of nacl decreased with increased fe doping however decrease in the overall particle density led to slower sedimentation of fe doped cuo nps than would have been predicted from their aggregation behavior fe doping significantly affected cuo dissolution p 001 promoting cu leaching out from the doped nps due to increased reactivity at neutral ph and increased surface area with fe doping fe doping did not increase the toxicity of cuo to a marine phytoplankton isochrysis galbana despite promoting ionic cu release total suspended cu was dominated by dissolved cu complexes in seawater and particulate cu in freshwater based on the abundance of different size fractions analyzed in freshwater the particles detected in water suspension were mostly 50 larger than 200 nm in diameter however these large sized particles are mainly composed of aggregated nanosized particles held together by van der waals attraction graphical abstract image 1 keywords copper oxide nanoparticle natural waters environmental fate toxicity transformation 1 introduction several applications of engineered nanoparticles nps require that they are combined with other materials which may be mere matrices or co primary ingredients the use of these nanocomposites has been widely reported in the literature adeleye et al 2016b de volder et al 2013 wagner 2007 wang et al 2011a in addition the composition of nps may be intentionally modified to form nanohybrids doped nps or composites in order to improve their functionality or reduce unwanted properties fairbairn et al 2011 wang et al 2011a xia et al 2011 for instance one of the primary applications of copper nps is in electronics and optics keller et al 2013 and the incorporation of small amounts of fe enhances the applications of cuo in magnetic storage devices keller et al 2013 yin et al 2010 doped nps have wide applications in fields including medicine biotechnology energy environmental science etc and their uses include chemical sensing biological imaging catalysis and environmental remediation adeleye et al 2016a chen et al 2004 thakar et al 2007 wang et al 2011a however doping may also influence the physicochemical properties of the nps and thus their environmental implications fairbairn et al 2011 xia et al 2011 for instance the dissolution and toxicity of zno nps were significantly reduced when they were doped with fe fairbairn et al 2011 recently several studies focused on the environmental implications of copper based nps due to the toxicity of copper and the increasing application of copper nps in consumer products adeleye 2015 adeleye et al 2016b ingle et al 2014 keller et al 2017 midander et al 2009 wang et al 2013 zhao et al 2016b most of these studies however researched single elements e g cu nps or common compounds of copper e g cuo nps while these studies provide knowledge useful for predicting the environmental hazard of the basic nps a good understanding of the fate and transformation of doped nps nanocomposites and nanohybrids is necessary since nanomaterials are often used and will be introduced into the environment in these forms studies investigating the fate of doped nps are currently rare in order to exhaustively investigate how the human health and environmental implications of nps may be influenced by doping them our research consortium synthesized cuo nps doped with fe 0 10 using flame spray pyrolysis techniques the fate and effects of the pure cuo and fe doped cuo nps were then carefully studied in the two important systems biological and environmental in a recently published article summarizing the finding in biological media naatz and coworkers reported that fe doping of cuo reduced the release of toxic cu ions in biological media naatz et al 2017 this article reports our findings on the environmental implications of the same pure and fe doped cuo nps the aggregation dissolution and transformation of the nps were thoroughly investigated in both simple aqueous media and natural waters furthermore the nps were exposed to an axenic marine phytoplankton culture in order to determine their potential toxicity to this important class of organisms 2 experimental section 2 1 nanoparticle synthesis the synthesis of pure and fe doped cuo nps was carried out using in house built flame spray pyrolysis george et al 2010 kemmler et al 2013 pokhrel et al 2010 copper naphthenate strem chemical 99 9 pure was used as a precursor with or without iron napthenate 12 fe by metal strem 99 9 pure all the precursors were diluted with xylene strem chemicals 99 95 pure to obtain a total metal concentration of 0 5 m to synthesize the library of cuo doped with 0 2 6 and 10 fe hereafter referred to as 0 fe cuo 2 fe cuo 6 fe cuo and 10 fe cuo respectively a 50 ml portion of 0 5 m copper naphthenate was separately mixed with 1 15 5 7 ml of 0 5 m iron naphthenate each liquid precursor was delivered to the nozzle tip by a syringe pump at a flow rate of 5 ml min by atomising the precursor solution with dispersant o2 at a flow rate of 5 ml min and maintaining a pressure drop of 1 5 bar at the nozzle tip combustion of the dispersed droplets was initiated by the co delivery of ch4 and o2 1 5 l min 3 2 l min to sustain a flame the particles were collected from the 257 mm glass filters placed at a distance of 60 cm from the nozzle commercially available cuo nps denoted cuo sa were obtained from sigma aldrich to compare with the one synthesized in house i e 0 fe cuo in addition cu and cu2o nps denoted ncu and ncu2o respectively were obtained from us nanomaterials houston tx to understand how the fate of the synthesized library of pure and fe doped cuo nps compare with these other copper based nps 2 2 x ray diffraction and brunauer emmet teller surface area analyses for the x ray diffraction measurements the nps 0 10 fe doped cuo were loaded into a bruker d8 diffracting system the diffractometer was configured in bragg

width of 0 03 2θ and 30 s per step the determination of the average crystallite sizes d xrd was achieved by the line broadening analysis during the rietveld refinement of the x ray patterns the instrumental contribution to the peak broadening was corrected using lab6 as an instrumental standard the adsorption desorption isotherms of nitrogen brunauer emmett teller bet were measured at 77 k using a quantachrome nova 4000e and autosorb 1 gas sorption system as a function of relative pressure p po over the range of 0 01 0 99 prior to the measurement the sample was outgassed at 200 c under vacuum to determine the specific surface areas the pore volume was estimated from the nitrogen uptake at p po 0 99 data were obtained by exposing or removing a known quantity of adsorbing gas in or out of a sample cell containing the solid adsorbent maintained at constant liquid nitrogen temperature 2 3 transmission electron microscopy the nps 2 5 mg were dispersed in absolute ethanol followed by ultrasonication for 1 h a drop from the resulting dispersion was placed on a transmission electron microscopy tem grid using an eye dropper and dried at room temperature high resolution transmission electron microscopy images hrtem were obtained using a fei titan 80 300 microscope equipped with a cs corrector for the objective lens high angle annular dark field detector haadf gatan post column imaging filter and a cold field emission gun operated at an accelerating voltage of 300 kv 2 4 particle surface charge the surface charge of the nps was estimated by measuring their zeta ζ potential using a zetasizer zs90 malvern uk for ζ potential measurements stocks of the particles were prepared in deionized di water barnstead nanopure 18 2 mω cm aliquots were taken from the stock to prepare samples 50 mg l in freshwater ph 7 1 the freshwater was made in accordance with epa method 1003 0 with 1 mg c l suwannee river natural organic matter srnom adeleye and keller 2014 epa 2002 ζ potential was not measured in seawater due to the high ionic strength which burns out zeta cells during measurements additional measurements were carried out in di water at several ionic strength conditions 0 10 and 50 mm nacl at ph 5 5 2 mm acetate buffer and ph 8 2 2 mm carbonate buffer the isoelectric point iep of the particles in 1 mm nacl was determined by adjusting ph with dilute hcl and naoh 0 01 0 1 mm and measuring ζ potential using the zetasizer multiple samples were used for titrations to different ph values so as to minimized the amounts of titrants used and thus changes in ionic strength of the nanoparticle suspensions 2 5 aggregation kinetics the critical coagulation concentrations ccc of nacl were determined for the synthesized pure and fe doped cuo nps as described previously adeleye et al 2014 adeleye and keller 2014 and summarized in supplementary information si section a1 for the analyses particle concentration was 50 mg l while ph was held at either 5 5 acetate buffer or 8 2 carbonate buffer with or without srnom 1 mg c l aggregation was studied at 20 c via time resolved dynamic light scattering dls using the zetasizer data were collected in triplicates at 30 s intervals for 1 h or until the hydrodynamic diameter was double the initial value for comparison the ccc of nacl was also determined for cuo sa and ncu2o in similar conditions as the pure and fe doped cuo nps the ccc of nacl was not determined for ncu due to the particle s high polydispersity and poor stability in aqueous media adeleye et al 2014 conway et al 2015 2 6 dissolution sedimentation and transformations the dissolution of all the nps was studied in conditions simulating the surface of natural waters 14 10 light dark 6000 lux 140 rpm bennett et al 2013 temperature was held constant at 20 c throughout the study which was carried out at two initial particle concentrations low 500 μg l and high 5 mg l initial volume was 300 ml and all experimental conditions were tested in triplicates aliquots for sampling were removed from the top 1 cm of the aqueous phase thus only dissolved ions and suspended particles were collected for analyses to reduce the possibility of contamination from metal leaching glassware was avoided in this study and all pipette tips were acid leached prior to use containers were either certified metal free vwr international radnor pa or acid leached before use 2 6 1 low concentrations studies these experiments were carried out to estimate the fate of the nps at concentrations similar to what is expected in the natural waters low ppb dissolved 100 nm and 200 nm cu fractions present in the aqueous phase were estimated similar to the method used in a previous study adeleye et al 2016b in brief dissolved fractions were separated from the particulate fractions with millipore amicon ultra 4 3 kda centrifugal filter tubes which retains particles greater than 1 5 nm the 100 nm fraction diameter 1 100 nm was defined as the fraction that passed through a 0 1 μm filter whatman uk accounting for the dissolved fraction 200 nm fractions diameter 100 200 nm were determined by subtracting the dissolved and 100 nm fractions from the fraction obtained by filtering with 0 2 μm filters thermo scientific waltham ma particles greater than 200 nm were defined as bulk in addition aliquots were measured without filtration to determine total suspended cu dissolved particulate cu was quantified via inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms using an agilent 7900 icp ms santa clara ca the detection limit ranged from 0 005 μg l in clean water to 0 96 μg l in high salt matrix dissolved fe was not measured as preliminary studies conducted in freshwater and seawater showed no significant leaching of fe from the fe doped cuo nps at the concentrations tested single particle icp ms spicp ms was also used to confirm the presence of nanosized cu fractions throughout the study using the agilent 7900 icp ms adeleye et al 2016b sp icp ms analyses were performed in time resolved analysis tra mode using an integration time of 0 1 ms per point with no settling time between measurements nist 8012 au reference material nominal diameter 30 nm was employed for determination of plasma s nebulization efficiency a nist traceable cu standard concentration 1 μg l was used to determine the elemental response factor method setup and data analyses were carried out in the single nanoparticle application module icp ms masshunter software agilent technologies santa clara ca this study was conducted for 14 d in both epa freshwater and seawater seawater was collected from the pacific ocean at santa barbara ca and filtered 0 2 μm before use only 0 fe cuo and 10 fe cuo were used for this study background cu in freshwater and seawater was not detectable 2 6 2 high concentration studies this study was carried out at the ppm range 5 mg l to allow for more precise detection of the different fractions dissolved 100 nm and 200 nm of cu from the nps via filtration techniques coupled with icp ms as explained earlier this study was conducted for 30 d using the four synthesized pure and fe doped cuo nps 0 2 6 and 10 fe and the three commercial nps in epa freshwater particles in the aliquots collected from the supernatants of samples on days 0 and 30 were visualized using a fei tecnai g2 sphera 200 kv tem equipped with an oxford inca x sight probe for energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds 2 7 toxicity to marine phytoplankton the influence of fe doping on the potential ecological effects of cuo nps was investigated by studying the toxicity of 0 fe cuo and 10 fe cuo to isochrysis galbana phytoplankton are primary producers in aquatic systems and are typically used to evaluate the environmental impacts of chemicals including those that are copper based in both freshwater and marine systems axenic cultures were obtained from the national center for marine algae and microbiota bigelow laboratory for ocean sciences east boothbay harbor me and were maintained in standard media f 2 made with 0 2 μm filtered natural seawater as described previously adeleye et al 2016b inoculants were cultured for 5 7 d and initial cell density was kept at 2 3x104 cells ml all experiments were conducted at 20 c 34 ppt salinity under cool white fluorescent lights 14 10 light

fluorescence was converted to cell numbers using a calibration curve based on cell counts done with a hemacytometer reichert buffalo ny experiments were run in 125 ml polycarbonate flasks media volume 80 ml and were mixed at 120 rpm on a rotary shaker new brunswick scientific nj to allow for gas exchange through the filter covered vents in flask caps additional experiments were conducted using cuo sa in order to compare its effects with that of 0 fe cuo each particle was tested in triplicate at 0 0 05 0 1 1 5 and 10 mg l exposure concentration adverse effects of the nps were assessed via growth inhibition and reactive oxygen species ros production 2 7 1 growth inhibition the average specific growth rate of the algae for the duration of exposure was calculated according to the following logistic equation 1 μ i j ln x i ln x j t i t j d a y 1 where μ i j is the average specific growth rate from time i to j x i and x j are the cell densities at time i and j respectively and t i and t j are the initial time of exposure and final time of exposure respectively percentage inhibition of growth was calculated as 2 i μ c μ t μ c 100 where i is the percent inhibition in average specific growth rate μ c is the average specific growth rate in the control group and μ t is the average specific growth rate for the treatment 2 7 2 cellular reactive oxygen species ros to investigate whether the cells of i galbana were in oxidative stress upon their exposure to the nps total ros level was quantified after 5 d total ros produced in the organisms was assessed by incubating the cells in black 96 well plates containing carboxy 2 7 dichloro dihydro fluorescein diacetate h2dcfda probe invitrogen molecular probe eugene or in the dark for 45 min at 20 c h2dcfda can diffuse freely across cells membranes and is popularly used as an indicator for ros ros in the cells promote the oxidation of h2dcfda to yield the fluorescent product 2 7 dichlorofluorescein dcf hong et al 2009 ivask et al 2015 the intensity of dcf fluorescence in the cells was measured at 485 nm excitation and 530 nm emission using a synergy h1 microplate reader biotek instruments winooski vt the assay was performed for each of the triplicates cultures with each culture measured a minimum of four times np only controls were also measured ros levels were evaluated according to equation 3 hong et al 2009 3 r r f t f c 100 where rr is relative ros level ft is the mean dcf fluorescence of np treated cells and fc is the mean dcf fluorescence of control cells 3 results and discussions 3 1 nanoparticles synthesis and characterization the specific surface areas and bet primary particle sizes d bet of pure and fe doped cuo nps ranged from 81 1 8 to 90 4 5 m2 g and 10 12 nm respectively fig 1 table 1 fe doping did not have much influence on primary particle size and morphology the crystallite sizes extracted from rietveld refinement of the xrd patterns were in the range of 9 12 nm reasonably agreeing with the bet primary particle diameters table 1 the low resolution tem micrographs of pure and fe doped cuo nps showed spherical particles the crystal structure of the nps was studied by probing a single particle via hrtem imaging the images showed single crystalline particles of 0 10 fe cuo nps with well developed lattice fringes the lattice plane distances of 0 2529 0 003 0 2514 0 003 0 2528 0 003 0 2498 0 003 nm were observed for 0 2 6 and 10 fe doped cuo nps respectively fig 1 the xrd patterns show sharp and well resolved reflections indicating a monoclinic system icsd 69757 with a 0 46927 nm b 3 4283 nm c 5 1370 nm α γ 90 and β 99 546 naatz et al 2017 torres duarte et al 2016 increasing fe loading resulted in an increasing peak shift indicating fe incorporation into the cuo lattice fig 2 a peak shift of 0 35 was observed for 10 fe doped cuo across the entire 2θ angles the ionic radii of cu2 is 0 71 å in square planar geometry and it is not possible for fe2 with a much larger ionic radius 0 77 å to substitute cu2 fe3 with a smaller ionic radius 0 63 å can easily substitute cu2 in the lattice hence the oxidation state of fe in the doped cuo nps is most likely 3 raman spectroscopy and electron loss spectroscopy eels analyses confirmed the formation of cufe2o4 in the fe doped of cuo nps naatz et al 2017 the isoelectric point of cufe2o4 was reported as ph 4 1 in a previous study li et al 2015 the amount of fe present in each of the fe cuo nps was confirmed via icp ms and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy table a1 elemental mapping via energy filtered transmission electron microscopy eftem showed that fe and cu appeared to be homogeneously distributed throughout the fe cuo nps at all fe loadings naatz et al 2017 the primary particle size of cuo sa ncu and ncu2o was 50 nm 40 nm and 18 nm respectively the full characterization of cuo sa ncu and ncu2o is presented in table a2 3 2 surface charge measurements at ph 5 5 the ζ potential of the 0 10 fe cuo nps decreased in magnitude became less positive as fe doping increased for instance the ζ potential in 10 mm nacl decreased from 24 1 0 8 mv represents mean standard deviation throughout the manuscript unless otherwise stated for 2 fe cuo to 12 9 0 6 mv for 10 fe cuo fig 3 and fig a1 the addition of 1 mg c l of srnom reversed the ζ potential of the nps from positive to negative at ph 5 5 suggesting a strong attractive interaction between the nps and organic matter in the presence of srnom the ζ potential of the fe cuo nps also decreased in magnitude with increased fe doping but unlike in the absence of srnom when ζ potential became less positive ζ potential was more positive with increased doping in the presence of srnom this behavior suggests the ζ potential of the doped nps shifted towards that of the dopant cufe2o4 ζ potential at ph 5 5 5 2 mv as the amount of the dopant increased with or without srnom present fig 3 the fe cuo nps were negatively charged in epa freshwater ph 7 1 with 1 mg c l srnom fig a2 similar to our observation in simple aqueous media the ζ potential shifted towards that of cufe2o4 ζ potential 8 5 mv at ph 7 as fe doping increased decreasing in magnitude from 24 1 mv in 0 fe cuo to 14 3 mv in 10 fe cuo dissolution of cuo np should occur at ph 5 5 leading to the release of cu2 the adsorption of these positively charged ions onto the surface of the nps could play a role in the measured ζ potential but the influence of the dissolved cu ions is probably small due to the short ζ potential measurement time 3 min the dopant in fe doped cuo cufe2o4 could be chemically unstable at acidic near neutral ph conditions forming cufeo2 and fe2o3 and dissolved metals ding et al 2013 kuan et al 2015 as shown in equations 4 and 5 4 c u f e 2 o 4 s f e 3 a q c u f e o 2 s 4 h 2 o a q 3 e a q 5 c u f e 2 o 4 s 2 h c u 2 a q f e 2 o 3 s h 2 o a q cufeo2 and fe2o3 could subsequently dissolve to form more cu and fe ions as shown in equations 6 8 6 c u f e o 2 s 4 h a q c u a q f e 3 a q 2 h 2 o a q 7 f e 2 o 3 s 2 f e 2 a q 4 e a q 1 5 o 2 a q 8 f e 2 o 3 s 6 h a q 2 f e 3 a q 3 h 2 o a q like in pure cuo nps both the cu and fe ions produced by these reactions can impart more positivity on surface of the fe doped particles if the ions adsorbed onto the surface of the particles as shown in fig 3 however the ζ potential of the fe doped nps became less positive with increased fe doping this suggests that the change in ζ potential due to fe doping was not driven by release of cu and fe ions but by the presence of cufe2o4 in the particles this is again probably due to the short timescale of ζ potential measurements the nps were negatively charged at ph 8 2 which is still below their observed iep table 1 the negative charge is likely due to the adsorption of hydroxyl ion or carbonate ions from the buffer onto the surface of the particles naatz et al also reported negative charges on the surface of the fe doped cuo nps in biological media ph 7 7 due to adsorption of serum albumin present in the media naatz et al 2017 we observed a minimal shift in the ζ potential of the fe cuo nps towards the ζ potential of cufe2o4 at ph 8 2 12 mv with increased fe doping at 50 mm nacl for instance ζ potential decreased in magnitude from 23 3 1 8 mv in 0 fe cuo to 19 0 0 5 mv as fe content increased to 10 the impact of 1 mg c l srnom on the ζ potential of the fe cuo nps at ph 8 2 was minimal as shown in fig 3 which is quite different than the behavior at ph 5 5 this is probably due to similarities in the surface charges of the nps and the organic materials at ph 8 2 which leads to weaker attraction than at ph 5 5 where they have opposite charges regardless the ζ potential of the nps in the presence of srnom at ph 8 2 also shifted towards that of cufe2o4 with increased fe doping cuo sa the commercial cuo nps obtained from sigma aldrich was also positively charged at ph 5 5 14 2 1 9 mv in 10 mm nacl and its charge was also inverted by 1 mg c l srnom 34 7 1 6 mv in 10 mm nacl at ph 8 2 cuo sa was also negatively charged but much more so than all the fe cuo nps ncu2o and ncu were negatively charged at ph 5 5 and 8 2 with or without srnom summarized in fig a1 in general the ζ potential of the fe cuo nps approached the ζ potential of the dopant cufe2o4 with increased doping in both simple aqueous media and natural water although ph ionic strength and srnom also played important roles in determining the surface charge of the doped nps we hypothesized that this impact of doping on the surface charge of doped cuo nps will be observed in other doped nps especially if there is a clear difference in the surface charge of the nps and the dopant 3 3 aggregation kinetics to determine how fe doping affects the colloidal stability of the cuo nps in aqueous media the critical coagulation concentrations ccc of nacl for the particles were determined at ph 5 5 and 8 2 with or without 1 mg c l srnom summarized in fig 4 in general the colloidal stability of the fe cuo nps decreased with increased fe doping at both ph conditions regardless of the presence of srnom this agrees quite well with the trend observed in the ζ potential of the particles which decreased in magnitude as fe content increased in the absence of nom the fe cuo nps were more stable at ph 8 2 where they were negatively charged than at ph 5 5 where they were positively charged for instance the ccc of 2 fe cuo was 10 mm nacl at ph 5 5 and 70 mm nacl at ph 8 2 although the surfaces charges were opposite at the two ph values fig 3 the difference in colloidal stability is due to differences in the magnitude of the charges the ζ potential of the nps exceeded 30 mv at most ph 8 2 conditions except in 50 mm nacl the typical threshold of colloidal stability is 30 mv everett 1988 in addition the reactivity of cuo and fe doped cuo in acidic conditions equations 4 8 which leads to the production of dissolved and particulate cu and fe species may have contributed to the poor stability observed at ph 5 5 the presence of 1 mg c l srnom only led to slight increase in the ccc at ph 8 2 probably due to the aforementioned weaker attractive interactions at ph 5 5 however the ccc increased by an order of magnitude in the presence of the same amount of srnom fig 4c in addition to imparting electrostatic stability nom coating can also interfere with the reactivity of the particles making them more stable at ph 5 5 as shown here similar to pristine cuo fe doped cuo nps followed the classic derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory of colloidal stability in the presence of nacl as ionic strength increased the electrostatic energy barrier was reduced and the attachment efficiency of the fe doped nps increased the role of fe doping on the colloidal stability of fe cuo nps was mainly a direct consequence of the effect of doping on the surface charge of the doped nps thus like most pristine nps the colloidal stability of doped nps may be predictable from the effect of the dopant on the surface charge of the doped nps cuo sa was much less stable than 0 fe cuo at all conditions tested fig 4c and d in fact cuo sa was completely unstable without srnom at ph 5 5 while the ccc of nacl for cuo sa at ph 5 5 was determined as 180 mm nacl when 1 mg c l srnom was present the presence of srnom did not stabilize ncu2o at ph 5 5 fig 4d instability of ncu2o and ncu at ph 5 5 may be due to rapid dissolution of the nps at this ph condition the stability of cuo sa and cu2o improved at ph 8 2 and similar to the fe cuo nps 1 mg c l srnom only slightly improved their stability at this ph condition 3 4 dissolution sedimentation and transformations cuo nps are not very soluble in natural waters adeleye 2015 adeleye et al 2014 conway et al 2015 keller et al 2017 and this study was conducted to determine the influence of fe doping present as cufe2o4 on the dissolution of cuo nps although both dissolved cu and fe species are typically produced during the reactions of cufe2o4 in aqueous media at acidic and near neutral ph conditions equations 4 8 dissolved fe was not detected in our experiments as stated earlier this is probably due to the low amount of fe in the doped nps 10 or less and more importantly the dissolution of fe is more suppressed than the dissolution of cu from cufe2o4 ding et al 2013 kuan et al 2015 this dissolution study was carried out at both relatively low 500 μg l and relatively high 5 mg l np concentrations the low concentration study was conducted in both freshwater ph 7 1 and seawater ph 8 1 although a higher dissolution was expected in the freshwater which had a lower ph equation 5 adeleye et al 2014 kuan et al 2015 the dissolved cu detected in seawater after 14 d was almost double what was found in freshwater this underscores the importance of complexation with aqueous anions in cuo fe doped cuo dissolution the full result and discussions for the low concentration experiment was provided in section a2 and fig a3 a5 in appendix in addition the low concentration study suggested that fe doping improved the dissolution of fe cuo nps to confirm this initial observation additional studies were carried out by exposing all the nps into the epa freshwater at particle concentrations of 5 mg l to allow for clear observation of trends in general we found that dissolved cu was significantly dependent on fe doping p 001 fig 5 a shows that increased fe doping led to higher solubility of fe cuo nps in water although there was no significant difference between the dissolved cu concentration detected in 0 fe cuo and 2 fe cuo after 24 h p 77 6 fe cuo had a higher dissolved cu concentration than 0 fe cuo and 2 fe cuo though not statistically significant with p 56 and 09 respectively dissolution of 10 fe cuo was significantly higher than both 0 fe cuo and 2 fe cuo p 02 for both as well as 6 fe cuo but not significantly with p 64 average dissolved cu concentration in μg l measured 24 h after exposing the nps to freshwater was 19 7 5 6 15 4 0 9 24 0 0 6 and 27 9 1 1 for 0 fe cuo 2 fe cuo 6 fe cuo and 10 fe cuo respectively we observed similar trends up to 30 d with average dissolved cu concentration in μg l of 25 2 0 5 23 5 1 0 33 1 1 3 and 39 8 2 3 for 0 fe cuo 2 fe cuo 6 fe cuo and 10 fe cuo respectively as shown in fig 5b there was a linear relationship between the doping and log10 k diss where k diss was defined as the dissolution rate after 96 h naatz and coworkers recently reported very high dissolution up to 70 within 24 h of fe doped cuo in cell media naatz et al 2017 in addition they found decreased dissolution of cuo with increased fe doping in cell media the dissolution of the fe doped cuo in the cell media were thought to be promoted by a decrease in media ph that resulted from interactions between the nps and carbonate species present in media in contrast they also found dissolved mass ranging from 0 08 0 01 for 0 fe cuo to 1 03 0 46 for 10 fe cuo over 24 h when the nps were exposed to di water their observation in di water agrees with this study conducted in environmental media in which we found 1 low dissolution of pure and fe doped cuo nps dissolved mass ranging from 0 52 0 15 for 0 fe cuo to 0 81 0 03 for 10 fe cuo in freshwater after 24 h and 2 increased dissolution of fe doped cuo with increased fe doping the differences between the dissolution kinetics of the fe cuo nps in environmental and biological media emphasize the need to characterize nanomaterials and their composites in the media of interest to properly predict their fate and effects cufe2o4 is somewhat unstable around ph 7 kuan et al 2015 which can promote leaching of ions especially cu from the doped cuo nps equations 4 6 the promotion of cu ion release is enhanced with increase in the fe doping of cuo content of cufe2o4 we hypothesize that the redox activity of the fe doped cuo nps coupled with increased specific surface area of the fe cuo nps with increased fe doping table 1 led to increased solubility of the fe cuo nps in environmental media the in house prepared cuo 0 fe cuo was more soluble dissolved cu after 24 h 19 7 5 6 μg l in freshwater than the commercial cuo obtained from sigma aldrich cuo sa dissolved cu after 24 h 11 1 1 0 μg l as shown in fig a6 faster dissolution of 0 fe cuo is mainly due to its smaller size 12 nm compared to 50 nm for cuo sa and thus larger surface area 80 9 m2 g compared to 12 3 m2 g for cuo sa in general the statistically significant trend of dissolution for the 7 nps tested in this study based on dissolved cu detected on day 30 normalized by total cu in particle was cu cu2o 10 fe cuo 6 fe cuo 2 fe cuo 0 fe cuo cuo sa fig a6 it is noteworthy that the dissolution rate of the particles may have decreased over time due to saturation since the studies were carried out in a closed system the initial dissolution rate is useful for predicting the behavior in open waters and the trends observed here should be valid for natural systems colloidal stability studies showed that the fe doped cuo nps became less stable with increasing fe doping fig 4 due to the decreasing magnitude of ζ potential fig 3 additionally dissolution increased with fe doping which led to higher concentrations of aqueous cu2 in 6 fe cuo and 10 fe cuo and that could have caused some subtle effects on the electrostatic double layers around these particles further decreasing their colloidal stability in water as such we expected particulate cu suspended in water to decrease with increasing fe doping however we found more suspended cu in these highly doped cuo nps compared to 0 fe cuo and 2 fe cuo fig 5c we hypothesized that the observed slower settling of 6 fe cuo and 10 fe cuo than expected is probably due to decreases in the particle density upon doping with fe since the density of cufe2o4 can be 13 38 less than that of cuo ali et al 2011 the faster settling of 10 fe cuo than 6 fe cuo at the early stage of the experiment suggests that other factors not considered here also play a role in the settling of fe doped cuo and requires further investigation based on the abundance of the different size fractions analyzed the particles detected in water suspensions were mostly 50 larger than 200 nm in diameter fig 5d however as shown in fig 6 these large sized particles are mainly made up of aggregated nanosized particles held together by van der waals attraction tem analyses showed similar morphology of 0 fe cuo after initial exposure to water and after 30 d fig 6a and c however several smaller sized particles were observed in 10 fe cuo after 30 d fig 6b and d in addition to aggregated particles with diameter similar to the 0 fe cuo nps these smaller sized particles suggest disintegration of fe cuo nps or the recrystallization of dissolved ions further studies are needed to confirm either of these hypotheses but the atomic data obtained via eds analyses fig a7 and a8 suggest that cu formed complexes with other anions in water 3 5 toxicity to marine phytoplankton the impact of 0 fe cuo 10 fe cuo and cuo sa for comparison on the growth of i galbana was monitored for 5 d when the cells are in exponential growth phase in general all three particle types had negligible effects on the growth of i galbana fig 7a c and fig a9 effects of nps on algae was estimated as growth inhibition i which showed that the growth of i galbana was either enhanced or inhibited by less than an average of 4 at all the concentrations considered fig 7 d statistically while the np type 0 fe cuo 10 fe cuo or cuo sa had a significant effect on 5 day algal growth rate p 0001 np concentration had no significant effect p 16 more so the interaction of np type and np concentration had no significantly influence on the growth rate of algae in this study p 70 which explains our observation of no serious effects at all the conditions studied the toxicity of cuo nps has often been attributed to dissolved cu ions leaching out of the particles intracellular dissolution of the nps upon uptake by cells or organisms and oxidative stress gomes et al 2011 gunawan et al 2011 ingle et al 2014 torres duarte et al 2016 wang et al 2011b zhao et al 2016a uptake of cuo nps via endocytosis by microalgae is more common in freshwater systems since rapid aggregation and subsequent sedimentation of the nps occur in marine systems perreault et al 2012 wang et al 2011b zhao et al 2016a we reported in a previous study that cuo nps both commercial and in house synthesized aggregated to micrometer scale within minutes of releasing them into a natural seawater consequently leading to more than 60 settling out of aqueous phase within a few hours torres duarte et al 2016 we therefore expected most of the toxicity to the organisms used in this study to emanate from dissolved cu with 10 fe cuo having more effects because of its higher dissolution rate icp ms analyses of aliquots of culture media carried out during toxicity testing on days 1 3 and 5 showed very low dissolved cu concentrations although more dissolution occurred in the fe doped cuo similar to our finding in the dissolution studies as shown in fig a10a dissolved cu concentration was below 0 5 mg l over 5 d at all the concentrations of the nps tested with dissolution rate decreasing with increased particle concentration fig a10b dissolved cu detected in the culture media are predicted to be mostly complexed fig a10c based on modeling using visual minteq 3 1 and complexed cu tend to be less toxic and less catalytic than free cu ions gunawan et al 2011 wang et al 2013 details on visual minteq modeling is provided in section a3 in the appendix cu speciation modeling predicts less than 0 4 dissolved cu at 10 mg l np concentration and a much smaller fraction as cu2 ros production by cuo nps in aqueous media is primarily caused by fenton like chemistry through the cu cu2 redox couple induced by the dissolved cu fraction kuan et al 2015 wang et al 2013 similarly fe species produced by the fe doped cuo nps equations 7 and 8 can also lead to ros production it is therefore not surprising that we did not observe elevation of intracellular ros production in the algal cells when exposed to pure and fe doped cuo nps 0 10 mg l compared to the control conditions fig a11 lack of toxicity to i galbana by pure and fe doped cuo nps at concentrations up to 10 mg l is therefore adduced mainly to slow dissolution and complexation of dissolved cu ions in natural waters in acidic conditions or open waters where more dissolution may occur fe3 produced by the fe doped cuo can catalyze additional production of hydroxyl radical in the presence of uv light equation 9 which may increase the toxicity of the fe doped cuo nps 9 f e 3 h 2 o h v f e 2 o h h 4 conclusions pure and fe doped cuo nps were synthesized by incorporating up to 10 wt fe into the lattice of cuo using flame spray pyrolysis fsp in order to predict the environmental implications of the nps we studied their surface properties colloidal stability dissolution and transformation in natural waters as well as their potential toxicity to phytoplankton we found that with increased doping the surface charge of the fe cuo nps in aqueous media approached the surface charge of the dopant cufe2o4 although ph ionic strength and srnom also played important roles in determining the surface charge the colloidal stability of the fe cuo nps decreased with increased fe doping with or without srnom the presence of srnom improved the stability of the fe cuo nps much more at ph 5 5 than at ph 8 2 fe doping promoted dissolution of fe cuo nps dissolved mass fraction was 0 52 and 0 81 after exposing 0 fe cuo and 10 fe cuo into freshwater for 24 h dissolution decreased with increased nanoparticle concentration there was minimal less than 4 inhibition or enhancement change in the rate of growth of isochrysis galbana cells exposed to up to 10 mg l of pure cuo nps or 10 fe doped cuo nps this reflects the 1 relatively slow dissolution of fe doped cuo nps in the growth media and 2

19746,in this study a detailed rigorous theoretical model was developed to predict the transmembrane flux of a shell and tube type vacuum membrane distillation vmd module for seawater desalination two modes of operation are used for performing the vmd namely lumen side feed in out configuration and shell side feed out in configuration in this study detailed mathematical formulations are derived for an out in configuration that is commonly used in seawater desalination applications experimental results and model predictions for mean permeate flux are compared and shown to be in good agreement the results indicate that although the simple vmd model that maintains a constant permeate pressure is easy to use it is likely to significantly overestimate the mean permeate flux when compared to the detailed model that considers the pressure build up in the fiber lumen the pressure build up of water vapor in the fiber lumen is identified as the crucial factor that significantly affects the vmd performance because it directly reduces the driving force for vapor permeation through the membrane pores additionally its effect is more pronounced at longer fiber lengths and higher permeate fluxes and this is achieved at higher feed temperatures and velocities and at lower feed salinities in conclusion the results of the study are extremely important in module design for the practical applications of vmd processes keywords hollow fiber vmd shell side feed pressure build up desalination modeling simulation 1 introduction membrane distillation md is a thermally driven and membrane based separation process that employs a hydrophobic and microporous membrane as a contactor to separate water vapor from a saline water stream at a relatively high temperature the temperature difference through both interfaces of the membrane generates a water vapor pressure gradient and results in transmembrane vapor flux from the hot feed to the cold permeate the hot feed comes in contact with the membrane and only the water vapor passes through its dry pores and condenses on the coolant side alkhudhiri et al 2012 khayet 2011 some of the main advantages of md processes over conventional separation technologies are as follows i a complete rejection of dissolved and non volatile species to produce ultrapure water ii a significantly lower operating pressure when compared to pressure driven membrane processes and a lower operating temperature 60 c 80 c when compared to conventional evaporation integrated with low grade thermal energy such as industrial waste heat solar and geothermal energies iii lower membrane fouling when compared to that of microfiltration ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis iv relatively lower energy costs and reduced vapor space when compared to those of conventional thermal desalination processes such as multi stage flash msf and multi effect distillation med alkhudhiri et al 2012 curcio and drioli 2005 francis et al 2013 kim et al 2013 2015 lee et al 2015a 2016 several common md configurations were proposed in extant studies and they include direct contact membrane distillation dcmd air gap membrane distillation agmd sweeping gas membrane distillation sgmd vacuum membrane distillation vmd and more recently liquid gap md lgmd and material gap md mgmd with an aim to enhance the md permeate flux and to reduce conductive heat loss alkhudhiri et al 2012 khayet 2011 among them vmd is deemed to exhibit considerable potential for scale up as it provides the highest flux and most efficient heat recovery when compared to the other configurations khayet 2011 although the agmd may provide similar albeit better internal heat recovery when condensation occurs inside the module however in the vmd process the condensation of permeate vapor occurs outside the module via a vacuum pump and this is considered the main disadvantage of this configuration when compared to other configurations such as agmd meanwhile agmd has several disadvantages such as complex module design and low permeate flux in the vmd process the hollow fiber membranes are widely used owing to their high packing densities that lead to high membrane surface area as a result its module displays advantages when compared to plate and frame and spiral modules for seawater desalination applications the hollow fiber md module has two main operating modes namely the lumen side feed in out configuration and shell side feed out in configuration previous studies extensively examined both feed configurations for the vmd process and each model has its own advantages and disadvantages however it is observed that the lumen side feed configuration is restricted by operational constraints especially due to crystallization in the fiber lumen at high seawater concentrations and fouling and scaling problems in this respect the shell side feed configuration is commonly used in seawater desalination applications however in the case of an out in configuration module although the viscosity of water vapor is significantly lower when compared to that of the liquid phase the vapor pressure build up in the fiber lumen should not be neglected because the pressure build up promptly deteriorates the driving force of vapor permeation through the membrane sun et al 2014 thus with respect to practical desalination applications in which hollow fiber modules are employed the module should be properly designed to ensure that the permeate pressure build up does not adversely affect the permeate flux especially for the scale up design of vmd module to the best of the authors knowledge this aspect is not completely described in detail in previous studies kim et al 2015 2016 lee et al 2015b shim et al 2014 sun et al 2014 most recent studies have investigated a vmd module with an out in configuration where vacuum is applied to both ends of the hollow fiber to alleviate the adverse effects of vapor pressure build up on the permeate flux kim et al 2015 2016 lee et al 2015b shim et al 2014 it is assumed that the permeate side pressure vacuum is kept constant and not affected by the number of hollow fibers based on this assumption they have established a transport model by formulating mass momentum and energy balances for the feed side without considering the permeate pressure build up conversely in order to demonstrate the local mass transfer in vmd process that considers the vapor pressure build up in the fiber lumen under isothermal operation a mathematical model was developed based on the basis of the hagen poiseuille equation to describe the pressure build up and the permeation equation based on knudsen diffusion of water vapor through the membrane pores sun et al 2014 however the hagen poiseuille equation is commonly used to describe the pressure drop in an incompressible newtonian fluid in a laminar flow flowing through a long cylindrical impermeable tube with a constant cross section while the equation may fail in the limit of low viscosity wide and or short tube it should be noted that low viscosity or a wide tube may result in turbulent flow and this makes it necessary to use complicated models such as the darcy weisbach equation in the case of excessively short tubes the hagen poiseuille equation may result in unphysically high flow rates and the flow is bounded by bernoulli s principle under less restrictive conditions cengel and ghajar 2011 thus the limitations of the hagen poiseuille equation significantly detract from its practical applications because it does not consider the effect of transmembrane flow resistance on the local permeate flux and pressure drop the aims of the present study are as follows i to develop a detailed mathematical model for the shell and tube type vmd with a shell side feed configuration for seawater desalination by simplifying the mass momentum and energy balance on both the feed and permeate sides ii to illustrate the effects of major factors involving module configurations cocurrent and countercurrent flow configurations and hollow fiber length and operating parameters feed temperature flow rate and salinity on the permeate flux and iii to demonstrate the pressure build up characteristics of water vapor in the fiber lumen 2 hollow fiber vmd process fig 1 illustrates a schematic of a hollow fiber vmd module with two different flow configurations that are considered in the study countercurrent flow configuration fig 1a and cocurrent flow configuration fig 1b baseline configuration the vmd module comprises an array of microporous hydrophobic hollow fiber membranes that are collectively assembled in a shell and tube module as shown in fig 1 a hot feed is circulated in direct contact with the shell side of the hollow fibers that is maintained at atmospheric pressure at the module outlet z l f while a permeate is removed in the vapor state from the opposite side of the membrane that is maintained under vacuum pressure an end of the fiber lumen is open to provide an outlet for the discharge of water vapor from the module and vacuum is applied to the interior at the open end of the hollow fibers therefore the permeate flux increases along the fiber from the dead end z l f for the countercurrent flow and z 0 for the cocurrent flow thus the vapor pressure in the fiber lumen increases from the open end to the dead end and this results in a vapor pressure build up along the fiber lumen leading to a decrease in the driving force p f m p p this phenomenon is examined in detail in the following sections to elucidate the effects of pressure build up in the fiber lumen on the vmd permeate flux 3 theoretical model 3 1 transmembrane flux as depicted in fig 1 the vmd process involves heat transfer across the feed side boundary layer adjacent to the membrane surface and through the membrane that is coupled with the mass transfer of water vapor through the membrane pores the heat transfer process mainly consists of convective heat transfer across the feed side boundary layer and subsequently of conductive and convective heat transfer through the membrane the heat transfer by conduction through the membrane and by convection across the permeate side boundary layer can be ignored el bourawi et al 2006 kim et al 2015 2016 lee et al 2015b the convective heat transfer q f across the feed side boundary layer is given as follows 1 q f h t 2 π r o n f t f t f m where h t r o n f t f and t f m denote the convective heat transfer coefficient the outer radius of fiber number of hollow fibers bulk feed temperature and liquid vapor interface temperature on the feed side respectively here the convective heat transfer coefficient h tf at the shell side is calculated as follows groehn 1982 2 n u h t d h k f 0 206

where x s denotes the molar fraction of nacl in saline solution in eq 6 p w m denotes the saturation pressure of pure water in pa which is determined by using the antoine equation as follows felder and rousseau 2000 8 log 10 133 3 p w m 8 07131 1730 63 t 233 426 where t denotes the temperature in c in the vmd process molecular diffusion dominated by molecule molecule collisions is negligible compared to molecule pore wall collisions because membrane pores are fairly small when compared to the mean free path of the diffusing molecules thus the knudsen diffusion mechanism dominates the mass transfer through the membrane pores in the vmd process el bourawi et al 2006 kim et al 2015 2016 lee et al 2015b mengual et al 2004 shim et al 2014 sun et al 2014 therefore the membrane permeability

thickness m w denotes the molecular weight of water and r denotes the universal gas constant 3 2 detailed transport models to demonstrate the transport behavior in the hollow fiber vmd module a detailed mathematical model is formulated by using mass momentum and energy balances for both feed and permeate sides by assuming the following i steady incompressible flow ii unidirectional lubrication flow of newtonian fluid for the shell side feed iii ideal gas behavior of water vapor in the permeate side iv negligible heat generation due to viscous dissipation v negligible axial diffusion compared to convection vi negligible heat loss to the ambient and vii uniform distribution of fibers in the shell side the mass i e overall molar balance and molar species balance for the

permeate flux defined in eq 5 3 4 solution algorithm thermophysical properties of seawater and water used in the study are based on those used by sharqawy et al 2010 the set of coupled ordinary

boundary conditions in eqs 19 21 and the transmembrane characterizations in eqs 1 3 and 4 for the heat transfer and eqs 5 9 for the mass transfer it should be noted that both feed and permeate sides are governed by boundary value differential equation and hence an iterative solution technique is employed the unknown values at z 0 are estimated and this transforms the boundary value problem to an initial value problem in the spatial direction this initial value problem is then solved by using broyden s method broyden 1965 the convergence criteria for a steady state is s n 1 s n 10 6 where s

the solution procedure used in this study is the same as previously reported lee et al 2015a 4 results and discussion in the present study two mathematical models are developed to demonstrate the effect of pressure build up of water vapor in the fiber lumen on vmd performance that is i the simple lumped vmd sm model in which the permeate side pressure is kept constant over the entire length of the hollow fiber membrane i e p p z p v a c without considering only the permeate side transport eq 16 18 and ii the detailed vmd dm model that considers pressure build up in the fiber lumen by considering all the aforementioned governing equations 4 1 model verification to verify and further examine the developed theoretical approaches the performance characteristics of the shell and tube vmd module as previously reported mengual et al 2004 were examined with respect to feed temperature and velocity at the inlet of the vmd module the hollow fiber module is packed with 40 polypropylene pp fibers the fibers exhibit a mean pore size of 0 2 μm an outer diameter of 2 6 mm a wall thickness of 0 4 mm a fiber length of 0 47 m a porosity of 70 and a liquid entry pressure lep of 140 kpa the module housing is a pp tube with an inner diameter of 0 025 m and a polyurethane resin is utilized as the potting resin the pressure in the permeate side is maintained constant at 4 kpa and pure water is employed in the experiments mengual et al 2004 two theoretical models i e sm and dm that consider and do not consider the permeate pressure build up respectively are used and the predicted mean permeate fluxes as a function of feed velocity in the range of 0 2 m s 1 0 m s and feed temperature in the range of 35 c 60 c are compared to the measured data mengual et al 2004 fig 2 the results clearly indicate that there is a significant pressure build up of water vapor in the fiber lumen it is also observed that an increase in the feed temperature results in a more significant pressure build up as expected additionally the relative influence of the feed velocity on the mean permeate flux significantly increases with the feed temperature due to the combined effects of the exponential relationship between temperature and saturation vapor pressure based on eq 8 and higher heat transfer across the feed side boundary layer at a higher feed velocity based on eq 2 conversely it is assumed that the feed velocity has a negligible effect on the mean permeate flux at low feed temperatures below 50 c kim et al 2013 2016 therefore the sm model maintains the permeate pressure as constant and is easy to use nevertheless it tends to significantly overestimate the mean permeate flux by approximately 30 46 when compared to that of the dm model it is noted that the vapor pressure build up in the permeate side cannot be neglected and the mean permeate flux that is predicted by using the dm model exhibits good agreement with the measured data 4 2 spatial variation with respect to the operating conditions t f in 50 c 0 2 m s v f in 1 0 m s the axial variations of permeate flux sm and dm models permeate pressure permeate temperature and permeate flow rate using the dm model are shown in fig 3 the permeate flux exhibits a linear decrease along the fiber length for the sm model while the variation for the dm model corresponds to an exponential increase that is more pronounced at higher inlet feed velocities this results in enhanced heat and mass transfer within the feed side boundary layer fig 3a a higher flow rate leads to an enhanced heat and mass transfer through the feed side boundary layer with a shorter residence time in the fiber and thereby reduces the temperature polarization resulting in a higher transmembrane temperature difference and thus a higher permeate flux el bourawi et al 2006 kim et al 2013 lee et al 2016 the exponential nature of variation is attributed to a significant pressure build up in the permeate stream near the open end of the fibers fig 3b hence the permeate flux over most of the fiber length is relatively small with a significant increase in the vapor permeation near the open end of the fibers evidently the permeate pressure build up along the fiber lumen results in a significant decrease in the driving force of the hollow fiber vmd process thus its impact on the process design should be considered the permeate side temperature at the permeate exit increases asymptotically with an increase in the inlet feed velocity from 0 2 m s to 1 0 m s fig 3c the results also indicate that the permeate temperature decreases slightly in a linear manner along the fiber length within approximately 60 of the fiber length although it exhibits a more significant decrease near the open end of the fibers in which the permeate flux is relatively large the cumulative permeate flow rate that is calculated using m p ρ p π r i 2 v p with the ideal gas law increases with the vapor flows along the fiber length from the dead end of the fibers to the exit and hence it exhibits a maximum at the permeate exit fig 3d as expected a slightly higher increase in the cumulative flow rate is observed near the open end with a higher permeate flux furthermore it is observed that the permeate velocity increases exponentially along the fiber length and thus the velocity gradient is steep at the open end of the fibers because of the abrupt decrease in the permeate pressure at that end which induces a significant decrease in the vapor density with an increase in the inlet feed temperature from 35 c to 60 c at an inlet feed velocity of 0 6 m s the axial variations of permeate flux sm and dm models permeate pressure permeate temperature and permeate flow rate using the dm model are presented in fig 4 the results also suggest that the permeate flux decreases linearly along the fiber length for the sm model and its variation is very small in contrast the variation is parabolic for the dm model fig 4a an increase in the feed temperature induces a more significant pressure build up in the fiber lumen and especially at higher feed temperatures fig 4b hence when the vapor pressure increases exponentially with temperature a higher permeation flux is achieved at a higher feed temperature and this results in a more significant pressure build up the corresponding permeate temperature fig 4c and flow rate fig 4d distributions tend to be similar to those shown in fig 3 however the effect of feed temperature on their variations significantly exceeds that of feed velocity an increase in the feed temperature increases the transmembrane temperature difference and consequently increases the driving force thereby yielding an increase in permeate flux that overcomes the increase in temperature polarization with increases in the feed temperature kim et al 2016 li and sirkar 2005 the development of the temperature boundary layer i e temperature polarization is mainly due to the water evaporation at the liquid vapor interface on the feed side and this can be assessed by the ratio t f m t f that depicts the temperature polarization coefficient in vmd 4 3 effect of module flow configuration to elucidate the heat and mass transport phenomena with respect to cocurrent and countercurrent flow configurations in the vmd process in detail by using the dm model the axial variations of permeate flux j z pressures p f p f m p p temperatures t f t f m t p and flow rates m f m p are compared for both configurations as follows cocurrent red lines and countercurrent flow black lines as shown in fig 5 the feed side inlet salinity temperature and velocity are fixed at x f in 3 5 wt t f in 50 c and v f in 0 6 m s respectively by maintaining the other operating parameters constant as previously discussed although similar slightly decreasing trends are observed only for the bulk feed side variables p f t f and m f irrespective of the flow configuration other variables display opposite trends for both types of flow configurations it should be noted that the local permeate flux increases along the fiber length from the dead end of the fibers to the exit while the mean permeate fluxes for both flow configurations based on eq 22 are almost identical fig 5a as also expected from the pressure and temperature distributions fig 5b and c it is observed that there is a high vapor pressure build up in the fiber lumen near the open end of the fibers the decrease in the permeate vapor pressure is due to the higher friction losses that in turn caused by the low reynolds number of permeate flow in the fiber lumen the high pressure gradient of the permeate vapor in the fiber leads to an abnormal increase in the permeate velocity fig 5d and this may restrict the use of an out in configuration vmd module at very low downstream pressure high vacuum vapor permeation occurs continuously along the fiber thus the bulk permeate temperature t p is directly affected by the continuous mixing of the upstream vapor and the transmembrane vapor the bulk permeate exhibits a slightly higher temperature when compared to that of the membrane surface t f m and further its difference t p t f m increases along the permeate flow direction and reaches a maximum at the permeate exit fig 5c it is also noted that an increase in the proximity to the permeate exit at which a higher permeation flux is achieved increases the temperature polarization and this is overcome by low downstream pressure 4 4 effect of fiber length and feed velocity the influence of the fiber length 0 1 m l f 0 6 m and feed velocity 0 05 m s v f in 0 2 m s on the mean permeate flux of the vmd module with saline water by using the dm and sm models is demonstrated at the inlet feed temperature of 50 c by maintaining the other operating parameters as constant as previously discussed the predictions are obtained by using dm blue bars and sm red bars models and their relative deviations green bars and it is clearly shown that the effect of fiber length on the permeate pressure build up significantly exceeds that of feed velocity fig 6 and table 1 as widely known in the case of dcmd process an increase in fiber length significantly increases the local transfer resistance due to the rapid build up of thermal boundary layers this reduces the transmembrane temperature difference and thereby inhibits the mass and heat transfer additionally the high reduction of mean permeate flux is attributed to a significantly lower temperature gradient across the membrane that is caused by the longer retention time of the stream with increases in fiber length kim et al 2013 yang et al 2011 hence although all film transfer resistances i e feed side membrane and permeate side play an important role in the mass transfer of dcmd process the feed side transfer resistances play a dominant role yang et al 2011 the phenomena in the vmd process contrast with the phenomena in the dcmd process this is because given an out in configuration an increase in fiber length incurs a more non uniform local flux profile because it results in a higher pressure build up caused by the higher flow resistance along the fiber lumen hence the permeate pressure build up plays a dominant role in the mass transfer of vmd process and this is more pronounced at higher feed flow rates thus it is noted that an increase in the feed flow rate decreases the temperature polarization and this results in a slight increase in the permeate flux this in turn yields a more significant pressure build up in the fiber lumen hence the relative deviations between the sm and dm models on the mean permeate flux are significantly higher at higher flow rates thus although the longer modules with larger membrane areas contribute to more water production an increase in the fiber length leads to a more non uniform local flux distribution and more severe membrane fouling at the feed side a longer fiber and the resultant increase in the membrane area can contribute to increased water production therefore the fiber length should be recognized as a crucial factor in the practical design for the scale up of out in configuration vmd module while ensuring that the driving force along the fiber is sufficient to ensure a high level of performance sun et al 2014 the predicted data on the mean permeate flux and their relative deviations at the various conditions by using the two models are summarized in table 1 as shown in the table the mean permeate fluxes obtained using the sm model are approximately 1 16 i e minimum at v f 0 05 m s and l f 0 1 m to 45 03 i e maximum at v f 0 2 m s and l f 0 6 m higher than those of the dm model further it should be noted that the effect of permeate pressure build up can diminish with increases in the fiber inner diameter and reductions in the fiber length while maintaining good thermal resistance and mechanical strength however this is at the expense of high membrane area packing density hence a trade off occurs between hollow fiber module volume and permeation achieved thus we plan to optimize the fiber dimensions for the hollow fiber module in the future 4 5 effect of feed salinity water recovery as is widely known the effect of concentration polarization on the permeate flux in the md process is significantly lower than that of temperature polarization al obaidani et al 2008 cheng et al 2011 el bourawi et al 2006 francis et al 2013 2014 kim et al 2013 lee et al 2015a hence to provide an in depth understanding of the effect of feed salinity on the vmd performance the model based mean permeate fluxes achieved by varying the inlet feed salinity from 0 wt pure water to 17 5 wt i e 80 in terms of water recovery are compared to dm and sm models while keeping the other operating parameters constant at an inlet feed temperature of 50 c and an inlet feed velocity of 0 8 m s fig 7 the dm model based mean permeate flux decreases from 10 86 kg m2h to 8 07 kg m2h while the sm model shows a decrease in mean permeate flux from 15 57 kg m2h to 11 16 kg m2h with an increase in the inlet feed salinity from 0 wt to 17 5 wt the results indicate that the relative deviations between both model predictions on the mean permeate flux are in the range of 43 37 for the pure water and 42 28 38 19 for the saline or brine water respectively these values exhibit a slight decrease with increases in the feed salinity it is noted that a higher feed salinity is associated with a decrease in the saturated water vapor pressure based on eq 6 as well as the driving force for permeation and this leads to a lower permeate flux based on eq 5 hence it is observed that the permeate pressure build up in the fiber lumen is relatively less significant at higher feed salinities 5 conclusions in this study detailed mathematical formulations for the hollow fiber vmd process with the shell side feed i e out in configuration for seawater desalination are derived by combining the transmembrane flux model with mass momentum and energy balances simulation results obtained using the detailed vmd dm model that considers the permeate pressure build up are compared with those of the simple lumped vmd sm model while keeping the permeate pressure constant the results indicate that this leads to an extreme overestimation of the mean permeate flux by approximately 30 46 when compared to the dm model under the given operating conditions it is evident that the permeate pressure build up cannot be neglected and hence the dm model based mean permeate flux exhibits good agreement with experimental data thus the permeate vapor pressure build up is identified as the crucial factor that significantly influences the vmd performance and its effect is more pronounced at increased fiber lengths and higher permeate fluxes that may be attained at higher feed temperatures and higher feed velocities and lower feed salinities therefore such a negative effect of permeate pressure build up on vmd performance can be offset by selecting appropriate fiber dimensions e g by increasing the fiber diameter and decreasing the fiber length which results in a conflict between vmd module volume and vapor permeation hence it should be considered as a crucial factor in a practical scale up design of vmd module

19746,in this study a detailed rigorous theoretical model was developed to predict the transmembrane flux of a shell and tube type vacuum membrane distillation vmd module for seawater desalination two modes of operation are used for performing the vmd namely lumen side feed in out configuration and shell side feed out in configuration in this study detailed mathematical formulations are derived for an out in configuration that is commonly used in seawater desalination applications experimental results and model predictions for mean permeate flux are compared and shown to be in good agreement the results indicate that although the simple vmd model that maintains a constant permeate pressure is easy to use it is likely to significantly overestimate the mean permeate flux when compared to the detailed model that considers the pressure build up in the fiber lumen the pressure build up of water vapor in the fiber lumen is identified as the crucial factor that significantly affects the vmd performance because it directly reduces the driving force for vapor permeation through the membrane pores additionally its effect is more pronounced at longer fiber lengths and higher permeate fluxes and this is achieved at higher feed temperatures and velocities and at lower feed salinities in conclusion the results of the study are extremely important in module design for the practical applications of vmd processes keywords hollow fiber vmd shell side feed pressure build up desalination modeling simulation 1 introduction membrane distillation md is a thermally driven and membrane based separation process that employs a hydrophobic and microporous membrane as a contactor to separate water vapor from a saline water stream at a relatively high temperature the temperature difference through both interfaces of the membrane generates a water vapor pressure gradient and results in transmembrane vapor flux from the hot feed to the cold permeate the hot feed comes in contact with the membrane and only the water vapor passes through its dry pores and condenses on the coolant side alkhudhiri et al 2012 khayet 2011 some of the main advantages of md processes over conventional separation technologies are as follows i a complete rejection of dissolved and non volatile species to produce ultrapure water ii a significantly lower operating pressure when compared to pressure driven membrane processes and a lower operating temperature 60 c 80 c when compared to conventional evaporation integrated with low grade thermal energy such as industrial waste heat solar and geothermal energies iii lower membrane fouling when compared to that of microfiltration ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis iv relatively lower energy costs and reduced vapor space when compared to those of conventional thermal desalination processes such as multi stage flash msf and multi effect distillation med alkhudhiri et al 2012 curcio and drioli 2005 francis et al 2013 kim et al 2013 2015 lee et al 2015a 2016 several common md configurations were proposed in extant studies and they include direct contact membrane distillation dcmd air gap membrane distillation agmd sweeping gas membrane distillation sgmd vacuum membrane distillation vmd and more recently liquid gap md lgmd and material gap md mgmd with an aim to enhance the md permeate flux and to reduce conductive heat loss alkhudhiri et al 2012 khayet 2011 among them vmd is deemed to exhibit considerable potential for scale up as it provides the highest flux and most efficient heat recovery when compared to the other configurations khayet 2011 although the agmd may provide similar albeit better internal heat recovery when condensation occurs inside the module however in the vmd process the condensation of permeate vapor occurs outside the module via a vacuum pump and this is considered the main disadvantage of this configuration when compared to other configurations such as agmd meanwhile agmd has several disadvantages such as complex module design and low permeate flux in the vmd process the hollow fiber membranes are widely used owing to their high packing densities that lead to high membrane surface area as a result its module displays advantages when compared to plate and frame and spiral modules for seawater desalination applications the hollow fiber md module has two main operating modes namely the lumen side feed in out configuration and shell side feed out in configuration previous studies extensively examined both feed configurations for the vmd process and each model has its own advantages and disadvantages however it is observed that the lumen side feed configuration is restricted by operational constraints especially due to crystallization in the fiber lumen at high seawater concentrations and fouling and scaling problems in this respect the shell side feed configuration is commonly used in seawater desalination applications however in the case of an out in configuration module although the viscosity of water vapor is significantly lower when compared to that of the liquid phase the vapor pressure build up in the fiber lumen should not be neglected because the pressure build up promptly deteriorates the driving force of vapor permeation through the membrane sun et al 2014 thus with respect to practical desalination applications in which hollow fiber modules are employed the module should be properly designed to ensure that the permeate pressure build up does not adversely affect the permeate flux especially for the scale up design of vmd module to the best of the authors knowledge this aspect is not completely described in detail in previous studies kim et al 2015 2016 lee et al 2015b shim et al 2014 sun et al 2014 most recent studies have investigated a vmd module with an out in configuration where vacuum is applied to both ends of the hollow fiber to alleviate the adverse effects of vapor pressure build up on the permeate flux kim et al 2015 2016 lee et al 2015b shim et al 2014 it is assumed that the permeate side pressure vacuum is kept constant and not affected by the number of hollow fibers based on this assumption they have established a transport model by formulating mass momentum and energy balances for the feed side without considering the permeate pressure build up conversely in order to demonstrate the local mass transfer in vmd process that considers the vapor pressure build up in the fiber lumen under isothermal operation a mathematical model was developed based on the basis of the hagen poiseuille equation to describe the pressure build up and the permeation equation based on knudsen diffusion of water vapor through the membrane pores sun et al 2014 however the hagen poiseuille equation is commonly used to describe the pressure drop in an incompressible newtonian fluid in a laminar flow flowing through a long cylindrical impermeable tube with a constant cross section while the equation may fail in the limit of low viscosity wide and or short tube it should be noted that low viscosity or a wide tube may result in turbulent flow and this makes it necessary to use complicated models such as the darcy weisbach equation in the case of excessively short tubes the hagen poiseuille equation may result in unphysically high flow rates and the flow is bounded by bernoulli s principle under less restrictive conditions cengel and ghajar 2011 thus the limitations of the hagen poiseuille equation significantly detract from its practical applications because it does not consider the effect of transmembrane flow resistance on the local permeate flux and pressure drop the aims of the present study are as follows i to develop a detailed mathematical model for the shell and tube type vmd with a shell side feed configuration for seawater desalination by simplifying the mass momentum and energy balance on both the feed and permeate sides ii to illustrate the effects of major factors involving module configurations cocurrent and countercurrent flow configurations and hollow fiber length and operating parameters feed temperature flow rate and salinity on the permeate flux and iii to demonstrate the pressure build up characteristics of water vapor in the fiber lumen 2 hollow fiber vmd process fig 1 illustrates a schematic of a hollow fiber vmd module with two different flow configurations that are considered in the study countercurrent flow configuration fig 1a and cocurrent flow configuration fig 1b baseline configuration the vmd module comprises an array of microporous hydrophobic hollow fiber membranes that are collectively assembled in a shell and tube module as shown in fig 1 a hot feed is circulated in direct contact with the shell side of the hollow fibers that is maintained at atmospheric pressure at the module outlet z l f while a permeate is removed in the vapor state from the opposite side of the membrane that is maintained under vacuum pressure an end of the fiber lumen is open to provide an outlet for the discharge of water vapor from the module and vacuum is applied to the interior at the open end of the hollow fibers therefore the permeate flux increases along the fiber from the dead end z l f for the countercurrent flow and z 0 for the cocurrent flow thus the vapor pressure in the fiber lumen increases from the open end to the dead end and this results in a vapor pressure build up along the fiber lumen leading to a decrease in the driving force p f m p p this phenomenon is examined in detail in the following sections to elucidate the effects of pressure build up in the fiber lumen on the vmd permeate flux 3 theoretical model 3 1 transmembrane flux as depicted in fig 1 the vmd process involves heat transfer across the feed side boundary layer adjacent to the membrane surface and through the membrane that is coupled with the mass transfer of water vapor through the membrane pores the heat transfer process mainly consists of convective heat transfer across the feed side boundary layer and subsequently of conductive and convective heat transfer through the membrane the heat transfer by conduction through the membrane and by convection across the permeate side boundary layer can be ignored el bourawi et al 2006 kim et al 2015 2016 lee et al 2015b the convective heat transfer q f across the feed side boundary layer is given as follows 1 q f h t 2 π r o n f t f t f m where h t r o n f t f and t f m denote the convective heat transfer coefficient the outer radius of fiber number of hollow fibers bulk feed temperature and liquid vapor interface temperature on the feed side respectively here the convective heat transfer coefficient h tf at the shell side is calculated as follows groehn 1982 2 n u h t d h k f 0 206

compared to molecule pore wall collisions because membrane pores are fairly small when compared to the mean free path of the diffusing molecules thus the knudsen diffusion mechanism dominates the mass transfer through the membrane pores in the vmd process el bourawi et al 2006 kim et al 2015 2016 lee et al 2015b mengual et al 2004 shim et al 2014 sun et al 2014 therefore the membrane permeability

permeate flux defined in eq 5 3 4 solution algorithm thermophysical properties of seawater and water used in the study are based on those used by sharqawy et al 2010 the set of coupled ordinary differential equations odes namely eqs 10 13 for the shell side feed and eqs 16 18 for the lumen side permeate are discretized based on the finite volume method and solved in conjunction with the boundary conditions in eqs 19 21 and the transmembrane characterizations in eqs 1 3 and 4 for the heat transfer and eqs 5 9 for the mass transfer it should be noted that both feed and permeate sides are governed by boundary value differential equation and hence an iterative solution technique is employed the unknown values at z 0 are estimated and this transforms the boundary value problem to an initial value problem in the spatial direction this initial value problem is then solved by using broyden s method broyden 1965 the convergence criteria for a steady state is s n 1 s n 10 6 where s

the solution procedure used in this study is the same as previously reported lee et al 2015a 4 results and discussion in the present study two mathematical models are developed to demonstrate the effect of pressure build up of water vapor in the fiber lumen on vmd performance that is i the simple lumped vmd sm model in which the permeate side pressure is kept constant over the entire length of the hollow fiber membrane i e p p z p v a c without considering only the permeate side transport eq 16 18 and ii the detailed vmd dm model that considers pressure build up in the fiber lumen by considering all the aforementioned governing equations 4 1 model verification to verify and further examine the developed theoretical approaches the performance characteristics of the shell and tube vmd module as previously reported mengual et al 2004 were examined with respect to feed temperature and velocity at the inlet of the vmd module the hollow fiber module is packed with 40 polypropylene pp fibers the fibers exhibit a mean pore size of 0 2 μm an outer diameter of 2 6 mm a wall thickness of 0 4 mm a fiber length of 0 47 m a porosity of 70 and a liquid entry pressure lep of 140 kpa the module housing is a pp tube with an inner diameter of 0 025 m and a polyurethane resin is utilized as the potting resin the pressure in the permeate side is maintained constant at 4 kpa and pure water is employed in the experiments mengual et al 2004 two theoretical models i e sm and dm that consider and do not consider the permeate pressure build up respectively are used and the predicted mean permeate fluxes as a function of feed velocity in the range of 0 2 m s 1 0 m s and feed temperature in the range of 35 c 60 c are compared to the measured data mengual et al 2004 fig 2 the results clearly indicate that there is a significant pressure build up of water vapor in the fiber lumen it is also observed that an increase in the feed temperature results in a more significant pressure build up as expected additionally the relative influence of the feed velocity on the mean permeate flux significantly increases with the feed temperature due to the combined effects of the exponential relationship between temperature and saturation vapor pressure based on eq 8 and higher heat transfer across the feed side boundary layer at a higher feed velocity based on eq 2 conversely it is assumed that the feed velocity has a negligible effect on the mean permeate flux at low feed temperatures below 50 c kim et al 2013 2016 therefore the sm model maintains the permeate pressure as constant and is easy to use nevertheless it tends to significantly overestimate the mean permeate flux by approximately 30 46 when compared to that of the dm model it is noted that the vapor pressure build up in the permeate side cannot be neglected and the mean permeate flux that is predicted by using the dm model exhibits good agreement with the measured data 4 2 spatial variation with respect to the operating conditions t f in 50 c 0 2 m s v f in 1 0 m s the axial variations of permeate flux sm and dm models permeate pressure permeate temperature and permeate flow rate using the dm model are shown in fig 3 the permeate flux exhibits a linear decrease along the fiber length for the sm model while the variation for the dm model corresponds to an exponential increase that is more pronounced at higher inlet feed velocities this results in enhanced heat and mass transfer within the feed side boundary layer fig 3a a higher flow rate leads to an enhanced heat and mass transfer through the feed side boundary layer with a shorter residence time in the fiber and thereby reduces the temperature polarization resulting in a higher transmembrane temperature difference and thus a higher permeate flux el bourawi et al 2006 kim et al 2013 lee et al 2016 the exponential nature of variation is attributed to a significant pressure build up in the permeate stream near the open end of the fibers fig 3b hence the permeate flux over most of the fiber length is relatively small with a significant increase in the vapor permeation near the open end of the fibers evidently the permeate pressure build up along the fiber lumen results in a significant decrease in the driving force of the hollow fiber vmd process thus its impact on the process design should be considered the permeate side temperature at the permeate exit increases asymptotically with an increase in the inlet feed velocity from 0 2 m s to 1 0 m s fig 3c the results also indicate that the permeate temperature decreases slightly in a linear manner along the fiber length within approximately 60 of the fiber length although it exhibits a more significant decrease near the open end of the fibers in which the permeate flux is relatively large the cumulative permeate flow rate that is calculated using m p ρ p π r i 2 v p with the ideal gas law increases with the vapor flows along the fiber length from the dead end of the fibers to the exit and hence it exhibits a maximum at the permeate exit fig 3d as expected a slightly higher increase in the cumulative flow rate is observed near the open end with a higher permeate flux furthermore it is observed that the permeate velocity increases exponentially along the fiber length and thus the velocity gradient is steep at the open end of the fibers because of the abrupt decrease in the permeate pressure at that end which induces a significant decrease in the vapor density with an increase in the inlet feed temperature from 35 c to 60 c at an inlet feed velocity of 0 6 m s the axial variations of permeate flux sm and dm models permeate pressure permeate temperature and permeate flow rate using the dm model are presented in fig 4 the results also suggest that the permeate flux decreases linearly along the fiber length for the sm model and its variation is very small in contrast the variation is parabolic for the dm model fig 4a an increase in the feed temperature induces a more significant pressure build up in the fiber lumen and especially at higher feed temperatures fig 4b hence when the vapor pressure increases exponentially with temperature a higher permeation flux is achieved at a higher feed temperature and this results in a more significant pressure build up the corresponding permeate temperature fig 4c and flow rate fig 4d distributions tend to be similar to those shown in fig 3 however the effect of feed temperature on their variations significantly exceeds that of feed velocity an increase in the feed temperature increases the transmembrane temperature difference and consequently increases the driving force thereby yielding an increase in permeate flux that overcomes the increase in temperature polarization with increases in the feed temperature kim et al 2016 li and sirkar 2005 the development of the temperature boundary layer i e temperature polarization is mainly due to the water evaporation at the liquid vapor interface on the feed side and this can be assessed by the ratio t f m t f that depicts the temperature polarization coefficient in vmd 4 3 effect of module flow configuration to elucidate the heat and mass transport phenomena with respect to cocurrent and countercurrent flow configurations in the vmd process in detail by using the dm model the axial variations of permeate flux j z pressures p f p f m p p temperatures t f t f m t p and flow rates m f m p are compared for both configurations as follows cocurrent red lines and countercurrent flow black lines as shown in fig 5 the feed side inlet salinity temperature and velocity are fixed at x f in 3 5 wt t f in 50 c and v f in 0 6 m s respectively by maintaining the other operating parameters constant as previously discussed although similar slightly decreasing trends are observed only for the bulk feed side variables p f t f and m f irrespective of the flow configuration other variables display opposite trends for both types of flow configurations it should be noted that the local permeate flux increases along the fiber length from the dead end of the fibers to the exit while the mean permeate fluxes for both flow configurations based on eq 22 are almost identical fig 5a as also expected from the pressure and temperature distributions fig 5b and c it is observed that there is a high vapor pressure build up in the fiber lumen near the open end of the fibers the decrease in the permeate vapor pressure is due to the higher friction losses that in turn caused by the low reynolds number of permeate flow in the fiber lumen the high pressure gradient of the permeate vapor in the fiber leads to an abnormal increase in the permeate velocity fig 5d and this may restrict the use of an out in configuration vmd module at very low downstream pressure high vacuum vapor permeation occurs continuously along the fiber thus the bulk permeate temperature t p is directly affected by the continuous mixing of the upstream vapor and the transmembrane vapor the bulk permeate exhibits a slightly higher temperature when compared to that of the membrane surface t f m and further its difference t p t f m increases along the permeate flow direction and reaches a maximum at the permeate exit fig 5c it is also noted that an increase in the proximity to the permeate exit at which a higher permeation flux is achieved increases the temperature polarization and this is overcome by low downstream pressure 4 4 effect of fiber length and feed velocity the influence of the fiber length 0 1 m l f 0 6 m and feed velocity 0 05 m s v f in 0 2 m s on the mean permeate flux of the vmd module with saline water by using the dm and sm models is demonstrated at the inlet feed temperature of 50 c by maintaining the other operating parameters as constant as previously discussed the predictions are obtained by using dm blue bars and sm red bars models and their relative deviations green bars and it is clearly shown that the effect of fiber length on the permeate pressure build up significantly exceeds that of feed velocity fig 6 and table 1 as widely known in the case of dcmd process an increase in fiber length significantly increases the local transfer resistance due to the rapid build up of thermal boundary layers this reduces the transmembrane temperature difference and thereby inhibits the mass and heat transfer additionally the high reduction of mean permeate flux is attributed to a significantly lower temperature gradient across the membrane that is caused by the longer retention time of the stream with increases in fiber length kim et al 2013 yang et al 2011 hence although all film transfer resistances i e feed side membrane and permeate side play an important role in the mass transfer of dcmd process the feed side transfer resistances play a dominant role yang et al 2011 the phenomena in the vmd process contrast with the phenomena in the dcmd process this is because given an out in configuration an increase in fiber length incurs a more non uniform local flux profile because it results in a higher pressure build up caused by the higher flow resistance along the fiber lumen hence the permeate pressure build up plays a dominant role in the mass transfer of vmd process and this is more pronounced at higher feed flow rates thus it is noted that an increase in the feed flow rate decreases the temperature polarization and this results in a slight increase in the permeate flux this in turn yields a more significant pressure build up in the fiber lumen hence the relative deviations between the sm and dm models on the mean permeate flux are significantly higher at higher flow rates thus although the longer modules with larger membrane areas contribute to more water production an increase in the fiber length leads to a more non uniform local flux distribution and more severe membrane fouling at the feed side a longer fiber and the resultant increase in the membrane area can contribute to increased water production therefore the fiber length should be recognized as a crucial factor in the practical design for the scale up of out in configuration vmd module while ensuring that the driving force along the fiber is sufficient to ensure a high level of performance sun et al 2014 the predicted data on the mean permeate flux and their relative deviations at the various conditions by using the two models are summarized in table 1 as shown in the table the mean permeate fluxes obtained using the sm model are approximately 1 16 i e minimum at v f 0 05 m s and l f 0 1 m to 45 03 i e maximum at v f 0 2 m s and l f 0 6 m higher than those of the dm model further it should be noted that the effect of permeate pressure build up can diminish with increases in the fiber inner diameter and reductions in the fiber length while maintaining good thermal resistance and mechanical strength however this is at the expense of high membrane area packing density hence a trade off occurs between hollow fiber module volume and permeation achieved thus we plan to optimize the fiber dimensions for the hollow fiber module in the future 4 5 effect of feed salinity water recovery as is widely known the effect of concentration polarization on the permeate flux in the md process is significantly lower than that of temperature polarization al obaidani et al 2008 cheng et al 2011 el bourawi et al 2006 francis et al 2013 2014 kim et al 2013 lee et al 2015a hence to provide an in depth understanding of the effect of feed salinity on the vmd performance the model based mean permeate fluxes achieved by varying the inlet feed salinity from 0 wt pure water to 17 5 wt i e 80 in terms of water recovery are compared to dm and sm models while keeping the other operating parameters constant at an inlet feed temperature of 50 c and an inlet feed velocity of 0 8 m s fig 7 the dm model based mean permeate flux decreases from 10 86 kg m2h to 8 07 kg m2h while the sm model shows a decrease in mean permeate flux from 15 57 kg m2h to 11 16 kg m2h with an increase in the inlet feed salinity from 0 wt to 17 5 wt the results indicate that the relative deviations between both model predictions on the mean permeate flux are in the range of 43 37 for the pure water and 42 28 38 19 for the saline or brine water respectively these values exhibit a slight decrease with increases in the feed salinity it is noted that a higher feed salinity is associated with a decrease in the saturated water vapor pressure based on eq 6 as well as the driving force for permeation and this leads to a lower permeate flux based on eq 5 hence it is observed that the permeate pressure build up in the fiber lumen is relatively less significant at higher feed salinities 5 conclusions in this study detailed mathematical formulations for the hollow fiber vmd process with the shell side feed i e out in configuration for seawater desalination are derived by combining the transmembrane flux model with mass momentum and energy balances simulation results obtained using the detailed vmd dm model that considers the permeate pressure build up are compared with those of the simple lumped vmd sm model while keeping the permeate pressure constant the results indicate that this leads to an extreme overestimation of the mean permeate flux by approximately 30 46 when compared to the dm model under the given operating conditions it is evident that the permeate pressure build up cannot be neglected and hence the dm model based mean permeate flux exhibits good agreement with experimental data thus the permeate vapor pressure build up is identified as the crucial factor that significantly influences the vmd performance and its effect is more pronounced at increased fiber lengths and higher permeate fluxes that may be attained at higher feed temperatures and higher feed velocities and lower feed salinities therefore such a negative effect of permeate pressure build up on vmd performance can be offset by selecting appropriate fiber dimensions e g by increasing the fiber diameter and decreasing the fiber length which results in a conflict between vmd module volume and vapor permeation hence it should be considered as a crucial factor in a practical scale up design of vmd module

19747,iron fe plays a critical role in the formation of hydroxyl radical oh which may participate in the indirect photodegradation of aquatic contaminants while fe photochemistry has been extensively studied the efficacy of iron amendments for contaminant attenuation in sunlit natural waters has not been well researched we studied the efficacy of this approach by monitoring oh induced acetochlor ac degradation and determining oh production rates with terephthalate tpa as a probe surface wetland waters as well as model fulvic acid fa solutions were amended with fe iii salt at different concentrations at ph values of 2 7 5 and 7 6 we observed no significant enhancement in the ac degradation rate at circumneutral ph at ph 5 ac degradation increased by more than 50 with an fe addition up to an fe t 6 μm and plateaued at high fe t at the highly acidic ph of acid mine drainage amd waters ac degradation was enhanced by two orders of magnitude with increasing fe t and no plateau was observed under the conditions tested fe t 500 μm while the fe induced relative difference in oh production rates determined using tpa was useful in elucidating the reaction mechanism for different dissolved organic matter types at different ph values the absolute value of oh production rates over predicted the transformation of ac suggesting the existence of unknown side reactions and or alternative reactive intermediates graphical abstract image 1 keywords iron photolysis agricultural runoff transformation kinetics acid mine drainage 1 introduction agricultural runoff commonly contains synthetic agrochemicals like herbicides that impair water quality in receiving waters scribner et al 2003 wetlands both natural and engineered have long been proposed as buffer zones to treat nutrients and organic contaminants jasper et al 2013 vymazal 2011 past studies have shown photochemical degradation as an important pathway for herbicide attenuation in wetlands due to their large sunlit surface area and shallow depths miller and chin 2005 prasse et al 2015 however an incomplete understanding of attenuation mechanisms and their efficacy due to the diversity of wetland water chemistry have hindered its widespread application the irradiation of wetland waters by sunlight creates various reactive intermediates richard and canonica 2005 zafiriou et al 1984 among them hydroxyl radical oh is of particular importance due to its highly reactive nature whereby many organic contaminants react at diffusion limited rates k oh 108 1010 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 the photochemical formation mechanism of oh is still an active research area but is generally believed to include 1 fe mediated pathways such as the photo fenton reaction fe ii reacts with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 both of which are photochemically generated and the irradiation of fe iii ligand complexes and 2 fe independent pathways such as nitrate nitrite photolysis and dissolved organic matter dom photosensitization schwarzenbach et al 2003 vaughan and blough 1998 vione et al 2014 zepp et al 1992 the contribution of fe dependent pathways to the overall oh production depends on the water constituents pignatello et al 2006 for example less than 50 of oh production is attributable to photo fenton pathways in irradiated suwannee river fulvic acid srfa vaughan and blough 1998 while more than 70 of the oh production in iron rich 5 14 μm satilla river water is believed to be photo fenton in nature white et al 2003 research however which focused on optimizing fe levels in wetland waters in the absence of external h2o2 to specifically enhance oh photoproduction and contaminant attenuation is lacking most relevant research about the impact of fe levels on contaminant degradation has been conducted in highly engineered systems which require costly addition of h2o2 fukushima et al 2000 oliveros et al 1997 pignatello et al 2006 in these studies the impact of fe levels largely depends on external h2o2 ph and other water constituents as for natural systems where both fe ii and h2o2 are photochemically generated vermilyea and voelker 2009 found that at neutral ph sufficient fe ii was generated in both selected natural water bodies and fe spiked 10 μm srfa solutions to quench all photochemically produced h2o2 however questions arise about the minimum total fe concentration required to generate sufficient fe ii and thus how to amend wetland waters with the right amount of fe for contaminant degradation therefore the purpose of this study was to determine the optimal fe concentration needed to enhance oh photoproduction and oh dependent herbicide degradation in selected diverse wetland waters because ph is a primary driver in fe chemistry due to a change in fe speciation and reactivity remucal and sedlak 2011 we specifically examined the influence of different ph values and the presence of different types of dissolved organic matter dom on oh

1994 guerard et al 2009 e2 e3 is the ratio of absorbances at 254 nm and 365 nm and is inversely related to h2o2 an important precursor to oh through fenton pathway quantum yield dalrymple et al 2010 the optical parameters suva280 and e2 e3 show that wf is similar to srfa which has a higher aromatic content a higher quantum yield for h2o2 production and thus is more likely to promote oh induced reaction while owc is more similar to plfa fa standards usually contain 30 nm total fe fe ii fe iii and are thus considered fe free for the purpose of this study guerard et al 2009 white 2001 xiao et al 2013 both wetland waters are well buffered with bicarbonate alkalinity 75 150 ppm as caco3 at their natural ph 7 6 and contain 1 2 μm total fe fe ii fe iii fenative which is presumably in colloid or complexed forms pullin and cabaniss 2003 stefánsson 2007 in contrast the amd impacted el is very acidic ph 2 7 with 100s of μm dissolved fenative making it ideal for oh photoproduction as discussed elsewhere none of the waters contain 0 5 mm nitrate omitted from table 1 for simplicity which is necessary for its importance in oh production miller and chin 2005 and thus nitrate is not considered in the following text 3 2 the impact of added fe on ac degradation and oh production as described below we presented kexp ac and rprod as a function of feadded in the form of ferric salt fet fenative feadded in selected water samples from neutral to highly acidic ph to explore the potential for enhancing ac photodegradation ph affects fe solubility complexation and redox potential and is often considered an important factor in the photoproduction of oh remucal and sedlak 2011 although not fully understood quantitatively with an increase in ph the speciation of fe iii and the photoproduced fe ii in wetland waters will switch from free fe3 and fe2 to inorganic complexes such as feoh2 and feoh and organic complexes such as fe dom changing their redox reactivity emmenegger et al 1998 fukushima et al 2001 rose and waite 2003 the role of dom which participates in both oh production via fe complexation or h2o2 production and oh scavenging were also explored under different ph scenarios 3 2 1 iron amendment under neutral ph 7 6 conditions the degradation of ac in owc and wf with different feadded 0 5 and 10 μm was monitored at the native ph of the waters as shown in fig 1 a ac degraded with a similar rate half life 40 h in owc and wf in the absence of added fe and is about twice its direct photolysis rate half life 90 h langlois et al 2014 the dominant mechanism for ac indirect photolysis is dependent on water chemistry for example langlois et al 2014 reported that oh accounted for almost all indirect photolysis of ac in everglades water ph 7 9 fenative 1 1 μm doc 25 mg c l 1 by using t butanol as a oh quencher our waters were very similar to that study as far as ph and fe are concerned and thus reaction with oh is assumed the most important pathway for ac indirect photolysis the production rates of the carbonate radical co3 from the reaction between oh and hco3 is about 5 20 of the production rates of oh rprod in our waters although co3 had higher steady state concentrations relative to oh co3 ss 5 10 14 2 10 13 m vs oh ss 5 10 16 2 10 15 m both determined in our waters see details on oh ss calculations in the methods section and co3 ss calculations in text s4 larson and zepp 1988 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 it is more than 3 orders of magnitude less reactive k co 3 a c 1 1 0 5 106 m 1s 1 zeng and arnold 2013 towards ac relative to oh as a result co3 contributes 3 of ac s photofate and is not considered further in this study non oh relevant reactive intermediates such as excited triplet dom and singlet oxygen even if they were unneglectable in our system do not usually change with fe addition and therefore have no effect on our data interpretation the lack of change in kexp ac with increasing fe in fig 1a clearly shows that the addition of fe iii to the wetland waters at their natural ph does not change ac degradation rates this result implies that similar levels of oh ss exist across the tested fe concentrations if we assume that oh scavenging does not change dramatically with fe addition as dom and bicarbonate are its major scavengers we would have consistent rprod oh photoproduction rate for owc and wf with increasing fe as was verified experimentally fig 1b the impact of fe addition on rprod in fulvic acid solutions is slightly different compared to whole waters fig 1b there is a noticeable increase in rprod between 0 μm and 2 μm feadded especially for srfa fig 1b the rate at 2 μm feadded in the srfa experiment appears to be an outlier and we currently have no plausible explanation for this difference thus this data point was not considered for our analysis similar experiments at ph 7 fig s4 also showed greater enhancement for srfa relative to plfa the outliner at 2 μm feadded was again observed with srfa at ph 7 although to a lesser degree it appears that most of the enhancement occurred between 0 and 2 μm fet while higher fet showed no further effect this could explain why we observed no significant changes in kexp ac and rprod for owc and wf since fenative already exceeds the optimal fe concentration therefore at neutral ph values an increase of fet to 2 μm may be beneficial 10 increase in oh production with plfa and 60 with srfa for wetlands that lack sufficient natural levels of iron before irradiation the native and added fe iii is largely complexed with dom fe iii dom equation 7 the mechanism behind the formation of oh at neutral ph has been proposed to be the photo fenton reaction equation 6 pignatello et al 2006 vermilyea and voelker 2009 although this process is usually optimized under acidic conditions ph 2 3 and partially due to higher fe solubility and slow dioxygen oxidation kinetics the presence of dom in wetland waters greatly enhanced fe iii solubility by complexation at neutral ph xiao et al 2013 nevertheless colloid fe iii is also likely present depending on its formation rate in our test waters pullin and cabaniss 2003 upon solar irradiation both reactants in the fenton process fe ii and h2o2 may be photochemically produced with fe ii formed by ligand to metal charge transfer from its dom complex equation 7 and h2o2 produced from photoexcited charge separated species within dom followed by o2 dismutation equations 8 and 10 zhang et al 2012 being redox active fe usually functions as a catalyst in whole fenton series reactions at neutral ph the competition from o2 equation 9 for photo produced fe ii lowers the oh generation rate as compared to moderately acidic ph 6 7 f e i i i d o m h v f e i i d o m o x 8 9 10 the above mechanism shows that dom is a key factor in generating both fe ii and h2o2 in fig 1b negligible rprod in bicarbonate buffered deionized water mq with fet 0 and 10 μm confirmed the importance of dom to rprod while a full kinetic model cannot be derived due to a lack of accurate rate and equilibrium constants for fe dom complexes a simple mass balance based model tentatively explains why there is a limiting concentration for fe enhancement 11 12 r h 2 o 2 a b s d o m φ h 2 o 2 13 y c r a t e o f h 2 o 2 c o n s u m p t i o n i n r e a c t i o n w i t h f e r h 2 o 2 14 both the fe independent photolysis rnonfe and the fe dependent reaction i e the photo fenton reaction rfenton in this case contribute to rprod although alternative fe dependent reaction pathways e g complexation between fe and dom may enhance oh production from dom may occur we lack the evidence for their existence based on a mass balance rfenton is limited by the production of h2o2 r h 2 o 2 which is a product of the light absorption flux by dom abs dom and h2o2 quantum yield φ h 2 o 2 equation 12 multiplied by the fraction of h2o2 that reacts with fe yc equation 13 and the yield of oh y oh equation 14 we assume that rnonfe r h 2 o 2 and y oh are independent of fet at a certain ph and therefore the addition of fe may only change yc according to the fenton reaction equation 6 yc is proportional to fe ii which depends on fet and competition from oxidation by o2 equations 7 and 9 once yc reaches unity i e fe ii is high enough to outcompete other h2o2 sinks rfenton approaches a maximum of r h 2 o 2 y oh see equation 11 and the increase in fet no longer changes rprod the comparison of the fe assisted maximum oh production between different waters revealed this trend wf srfa plfa owc fig 1b this trend is ascribed to differences in rnonfe r h 2 o 2 and or y oh because srfa and plfa had similar rnonfe fig 1b when fet 0 the difference between them can be attributed to r h 2 o 2 and or y oh among the two terms r h 2 o 2 is higher for srfa due to its higher light absorbance abs dom table 1 and φ h 2 o 2 estimated from its lower e2 e3 ratio in table 1 which is negatively correlated to φ h 2 o 2 dalrymple et al 2010 y oh on the other hand is harder to predict the only relevant reported y oh for photo fenton reaction is 0 26 0 13 for srfa at ph of 7 vermilyea and voelker 2009 however no comparison could be made for plfa or other waters samples y oh may be greatly affected by ph and fe ii complexation and perhaps the microenvironment of the fenton reaction equation 6 miller et al 2016 2013 remucal and sedlak 2011 3 2 2 hydroxyl radical production under moderately acidic ph 5 conditions under moderately acidic ph both the oh production and its induced ac degradation were faster compared to those at neutral ph fig 1 the benefit of fe amendment also becomes more apparent an increase of 50 and 100 respectively in the ac degradation rate was observed for wf and owc from 0 to up to 10 μm of feadded fig 1c there is no statistical difference between 5 and 10 μm feadded or 6 and 11 μm fet indicating an optimal fe concentration is reached when fet 6 μm as for the rprod depicted in fig 1d all tested waters show a continuous increase in rprod with a possible plateau 11 μm fet therefore for moderately acidic waters with low fet 1 μm adding a few μm feadded has the potential to double or even triple oh production allowing for an increase in herbicide degradation fe iii at ph 5 is mostly complexed with dom while only a small portion fe ii is complexed due to less favorable binding to carboxylate based functional groups which favor hard acids such as fe iii voelker and sulzberger 1996 the mechanism behind oh production at around ph 5 is likely to be similar to neutral ph described above but with altered rate constants especially k o 2 for equation 9 equation 11 is used again to shed light on the role of ph on oh production rnonfe is only doubled at ph 5 compared to ph 7 6 for srfa and plfa fig 1b and d however maximum rfe is approximately one order of magnitude higher at ph 5 compared to ph 7 6 the decrease in ph tends to slightly decrease φ h 2 o 2 dalrymple et al 2010 laszakovits 2016 which is in contrast to the significant increases in rfe negligible changes in abs dom also do not explain the ph dependence on rfe the remaining terms to influence rfe are yc and y oh the oxidation of fe ii by oxygen which could otherwise react with h2o2 to form oh is significantly less favorable at lower ph miller et al 1995 as a result yc may be much higher at ph 5 at low fet 11 μm with the increase of fet yc reaches unity and rfe reaches its maximum and the one order of magnitude increase in rfe from neutral to moderately acidic ph values could only be ascribed to y oh although more research needs to be done low ph or complexation with organic ligands tends to increase y oh miller et al 2016 2013 remucal and sedlak 2011 our experimental data of higher rprod and kexp ac at ph 5 compared to ph 7 6 demonstrates that lowering ph plays an important role in y oh 3 2 3 hydroxyl radical production under highly acidic ph 2 7 conditions the amd impacted el sample shows high reactivity towards ac degradation as depicted in fig 2 which is two orders of magnitude higher than that at moderately acidic ph fig 1c we determined the impact of fe addition on ac degradation with both owc water and a mq control in contrast to higher ph values where the addition of fe in mq tends to have no enhancement fig 1b and d the first order rate constants increased with the addition of fe almost linearly for both mq and owc fig 2 no plateau was reached for the highest concentration tested 500 μm fet the owc water showed much less reactivity compared to mq this decreased reactivity is in contrast to the greater h2o2 production from dom photolysis in owc water and is mainly ascribed to higher oh scavenging and light screening in owc water higher reactivity with mq also suggests that the aforementioned photo fenton reaction is no longer an important pathway at this ph correspondingly the oh production rate was only determined for the el water rprod was 8340 780 nm min 1 oh scavenging rate was 5 5 4 3 104 s 1 and oh ss was 2 5 2 0 10 12 m with this high oh induced reactivity amd impacted water or similarly engineered water treatment systems may serve as an available and economic reservoir for treatment of agricultural runoff resulting in pesticide half lives on the order of minutes under natural sunlight at ph 2 7 fet is in the form of feoh2 in sulfate poor waters mq and owc and feso4 and feoh2 in the el sample before irradiation the mechanism of oh production in iron rich highly acidic waters does not require dom as it does at higher ph values instead oh production is largely due to the photochemical reaction of fe iii hydroxy complexes particularly feoh2 allen et al 1996 15 whose fractional concentration e g 8 in el enough for high oh production strongly depends on ph and the available inorganic ligands such as sulfate e g 20 mm in el and complexed with 80 of fe iii photo fenton reactions equations 6 10 are usually optimized at highly acidic ph however lacking an external source of h2o2 in this study the initial oh production rate from photo fenton reactions is limited by in situ h2o2 production r h 2 o 2 from dom photolysis r h 2 o 2 ranges from 10 3 102 nm min 1 avery et al 2005 cooper et al 1988 vermilyea and voelker 2009 which is orders of magnitude lower than the measured production of oh in this study fig 2 this difference is not surprising since both the quantum yield of h2o2 10 3 10 4 from dom and the light absorption by dom are much lower than the quantum yield of oh 10 2 10 1 and light absorption by feoh2 dalrymple et al 2010 kieber et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 although not formed initially from dom photolysis h2o2 may be formed from o2 and carbon centered radicals in the later stages of irradiation sun and pignatello 1993 nevertheless at highly acidic ph values the oh production was initiated from feoh2 photolysis and supplemented by photo fenton reactions at a later stage 3 3 comparison of experimental and calculated ac degradation rate at different ph values we estimated kac based on rprod with the knowledge of both oh production and ac degradation rate constants and this method may be used to predict the fate of other pesticides if their second order oh rate constants are known ac degradation rate constants were calculated as a summation of oh induced photolysis k oh ac using the experimental rprod and the screening factor adjusted direct photolysis kdir ac sf comparison at ph 2 7 was not included in this analysis due to differences in oh measurement methods and its large 95 confidence intervals fig 3 shows k oh ac kdir ac sf kexp ac for almost all conditions at both ph 5 and 7 6 the magnitude of these differences k oh ac kdir ac sf kexp ac kexp ac was 50 100 at ph of 7 6 and 50 200 at ph of 5 to address these discrepancies we may have underestimated the oh scavenging rates for the dom used in this study we assumed that they would fall within the range reported by brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 1 4 3 3 104 l mg c 1 s 1 but others have reported a somewhat greater range of dom scavenging rate constants typically 1 7 104 l mg c 1 s 1 depending on the dom used and oh production mechanisms page et al 2010 rosario ortiz et al 2008 westerhoff et al 2007 1999 nevertheless in order to manipulate the model so estimates are in agreement with kexp ac it would require dom scavenging rate constants on the order of 6 15 104 l mg c 1 s 1 while possible at the lower end of this enhanced range we believe it unlikely to explain the discrepancies between model predictions and our observations the second reason for the model discrepancy is that the yield of htpa in the presence of photo irradiated fe and our dom is much higher than 0 35 charbouillot et al 2011 determined the htpa yield to be somewhat smaller 0 15 0 30 depending on ph and temperature and the impact of organic acids such as acetic acid was insignificant in aqueous media in equilibrium with air irradiated srfa spiked with fe has been shown to reduce the phenol yield from reaction between benzene and oh by half vermilyea and voelker 2009 the same mechanism may apply to the yield of htpa which would enlarge the model discrepancy an increase in htpa yield to 0 85 has been observed when strong oxidants like ircl 6 2 was used in place of o2 mark et al 1998 however no such oxidants existed in our system and we consider this hypothesis highly unlikely a third reason may be due to the side reactions emanating from the oh probe tpa the 1 mm tpa may produce additional h2o2 upon photoexcitation by the uv portion of sunlight the carboxyl groups on tpa may also bind fe iii and promote ligand to metal charge transfer for the photo reduction of fe iii both mechanisms may increase the oh production rate to above that anticipated for irradiated fe and dom future experiments capable of measuring nm level of h2o2 and fe ii may help to test this hypothesis our final explanation lies in the heterogeneity of reactive hydroxylating species and the reaction selectiveness towards these species by different probe compounds such as tpa and ac free oh low energy hydroxylation and higher oxidation state fe species such as fe iv are among the hydroxylating species generated by the photolysis of dom and fe the formation of fe iv in particular has been proposed in fenton type reactions at circumneutral ph values gallard et al 1998 lee et al 2013 remucal and sedlak 2011 if fe iv was produced in our system and if tpa has a higher reactivity towards this species relative to ac this may result in over estimates of kexp ac vione et al 2014 suggested that tpa compared to electron rich aromatic compounds ac in this case tends to react faster with fe iv than with oh corroborating with our assumption if fe iv was formed y oh equation 14 would be 1 in contrast to the discussion earlier no strong ph dependence of y oh was found in fig 3 4 conclusions the effectiveness of fe assisted ac degradation and oh production in studied wetland waters without external h2o2 addition was first explored in this study the efficacy of this process increased with decreasing ph as a result of different reaction mechanisms i e the photo fenton reactions under mildly acidic to circumneutral conditions and the photolysis of fe iii aquo complexes under highly acidic ph waters adding fe in the form of fe iii salts was beneficial in certain situations at neutral ph 7 6 when fet is 1 μm the addition of fe to fet of 1 2 μm could increase the degradation of ac by tens of percent under moderately acidic conditions ph 5 when fet is 1 μm addition of fe to fet of 6 11 μm may increase ac photo attenuation by 50 100 for amd impacted waters where the ph is highly acidic 2 7 and fe iii is on the order of 100 μm ac was completely degraded in a few minutes under natural sunlight however the efficiency of this the aforementioned processes at different ph levels are also highly dependent upon the amount and type of dom present in the surface waters at neutral ph terrestrial dom e g srfa would favor the fe assisted oh production relative to microbially derived dom e g plfa this was not observed for moderately acidic ph waters where both dom promote similar enhancement at ph 2 7 dom inhibited fe assisted herbicide degradation this study may shed light on selecting the right ph and fe concentration for future field applications when fe amendment is likely to be beneficial in particular amd waters have beneficial reuse potential for their ability to photo generate high levels of oh resulting in the rapid degradation of organic contaminants such as herbicides acknowledgement this work was supported by the ohio water development authority 4968 and

19747,iron fe plays a critical role in the formation of hydroxyl radical oh which may participate in the indirect photodegradation of aquatic contaminants while fe photochemistry has been extensively studied the efficacy of iron amendments for contaminant attenuation in sunlit natural waters has not been well researched we studied the efficacy of this approach by monitoring oh induced acetochlor ac degradation and determining oh production rates with terephthalate tpa as a probe surface wetland waters as well as model fulvic acid fa solutions were amended with fe iii salt at different concentrations at ph values of 2 7 5 and 7 6 we observed no significant enhancement in the ac degradation rate at circumneutral ph at ph 5 ac degradation increased by more than 50 with an fe addition up to an fe t 6 μm and plateaued at high fe t at the highly acidic ph of acid mine drainage amd waters ac degradation was enhanced by two orders of magnitude with increasing fe t and no plateau was observed under the conditions tested fe t 500 μm while the fe induced relative difference in oh production rates determined using tpa was useful in elucidating the reaction mechanism for different dissolved organic matter types at different ph values the absolute value of oh production rates over predicted the transformation of ac suggesting the existence of unknown side reactions and or alternative reactive intermediates graphical abstract image 1 keywords iron photolysis agricultural runoff transformation kinetics acid mine drainage 1 introduction agricultural runoff commonly contains synthetic agrochemicals like herbicides that impair water quality in receiving waters scribner et al 2003 wetlands both natural and engineered have long been proposed as buffer zones to treat nutrients and organic contaminants jasper et al 2013 vymazal 2011 past studies have shown photochemical degradation as an important pathway for herbicide attenuation in wetlands due to their large sunlit surface area and shallow depths miller and chin 2005 prasse et al 2015 however an incomplete understanding of attenuation mechanisms and their efficacy due to the diversity of wetland water chemistry have hindered its widespread application the irradiation of wetland waters by sunlight creates various reactive intermediates richard and canonica 2005 zafiriou et al 1984 among them hydroxyl radical oh is of particular importance due to its highly reactive nature whereby many organic contaminants react at diffusion limited rates k oh 108 1010 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 the photochemical formation mechanism of oh is still an active research area but is generally believed to include 1 fe mediated pathways such as the photo fenton reaction fe ii reacts with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 both of which are photochemically generated and the irradiation of fe iii ligand complexes and 2 fe independent pathways such as nitrate nitrite photolysis and dissolved organic matter dom photosensitization schwarzenbach et al 2003 vaughan and blough 1998 vione et al 2014 zepp et al 1992 the contribution of fe dependent pathways to the overall oh production depends on the water constituents pignatello et al 2006 for example less than 50 of oh production is attributable to photo fenton pathways in irradiated suwannee river fulvic acid srfa vaughan and blough 1998 while more than 70 of the oh production in iron rich 5 14 μm satilla river water is believed to be photo fenton in nature white et al 2003 research however which focused on optimizing fe levels in wetland waters in the absence of external h2o2 to specifically enhance oh photoproduction and contaminant attenuation is lacking most relevant research about the impact of fe levels on contaminant degradation has been conducted in highly engineered systems which require costly addition of h2o2 fukushima et al 2000 oliveros et al 1997 pignatello et al 2006 in these studies the impact of fe levels largely depends on external h2o2 ph and other water constituents as for natural systems where both fe ii and h2o2 are photochemically generated vermilyea and voelker 2009 found that at neutral ph sufficient fe ii was generated in both selected natural water bodies and fe spiked 10 μm srfa solutions to quench all photochemically produced h2o2 however questions arise about the minimum total fe concentration required to generate sufficient fe ii and thus how to amend wetland waters with the right amount of fe for contaminant degradation therefore the purpose of this study was to determine the optimal fe concentration needed to enhance oh photoproduction and oh dependent herbicide degradation in selected diverse wetland waters because ph is a primary driver in fe chemistry due to a change in fe speciation and reactivity remucal and sedlak 2011 we specifically examined the influence of different ph values and the presence of different types of dissolved organic matter dom on oh dependent herbicide degradation acetochlor ac is a commonly applied row crop herbicide and was used as a proxy compound in this study due to its known oh specific degradation pathway and frequent detection in streams fernandez cornejo et al 2014 fulkerson brekken and brezonik 1998 scribner et al 2003 2 methods 2 1 reagents acetochlor ac analytical standard 96 0 and 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid

variety of wetland waters aliquots of ferric sulfate 1 mm fe iii dissolved in 0 01 m hcl were added to the solutions to yield a 2 10 μm final added concentration feadded followed by a second ph adjustment the solutions were then stirred over night to allow time for fe complexation without noticeable precipitation at all ph values tested after a final ph adjustment capped quartz tubes were filled with solutions and irradiated in an atlas suntest cps solar simulator equipped with a 500 w m 2 xenon lamp and a solar standard filter at 25 2 c at designated times replicate sample tubes were withdrawn for ph uv vis and high performance liquid chromatography hplc measurements the photolysis of 100 nm of tpa s oh adduct htpa was also conducted in the same manner at ph 5 0 and 7 6 to measure the direct photolysis of htpa in our light source 2 4 analytical methods ac tpa and htpa were measured using a waters hplc equipped with a 1525 binary hplc pump and a 717plus autosampler connected to

with oh to produce fluorescent htpa at a yield of 35 page et al 2010 which was monitored by hplc at a nm level however in our solar simulator the direct photolysis of htpa under wavelengths shorter than 360 nm cannot be ignored therefore to obtain rprod the net change of htpa over time was fitted using scientist 3 0 based on htpa s formation and decay kinetics as shown in equations 1 3 1 d h t p

representative examples of the typical aqueous chemical composition found in ohio wetlands el acid mine drainage amd impacted water was included because of its potential use as a possible agrochemical treatment method without the need for fe addition and ph adjustment and may serve as a model for the repurposing of amd impacted waters where practical in an effort to characterize the role of fe srfa and plfa solutions were used as fe free waters srfa and plfa were also used to understand the role of dom alone on attenuation mechanisms because they are well studied end members of terrestrial and microbial sources respectively on the dom source continuum mcknight et al 2001 the relevant chemical and optical properties of all the waters tested in this study are tabulated in table 1 suva280 specific ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm is the absorbance at 280 nm normalized to doc concentration and is an indicator of dom aromaticity and potential to promote oh mediated degradation chin et al 1994 guerard et al 2009 e2 e3 is the ratio of absorbances at 254 nm and 365 nm and is inversely related to h2o2 an important precursor to oh through fenton pathway quantum yield dalrymple et al 2010 the optical parameters suva280 and e2 e3 show that wf is similar to srfa which has a higher aromatic content a higher quantum yield for h2o2 production and thus is more likely to promote oh induced reaction while owc is more similar to plfa fa standards usually contain 30 nm total fe fe ii fe iii and are thus considered fe free for the purpose of this study guerard et al 2009 white 2001 xiao et al 2013 both wetland waters are well buffered with bicarbonate alkalinity 75 150 ppm as caco3 at their natural ph 7 6 and contain 1 2 μm total fe fe ii fe iii fenative which is presumably in colloid or complexed forms pullin and cabaniss 2003 stefánsson 2007 in contrast the amd impacted el is very acidic ph 2 7 with 100s of μm dissolved fenative making it ideal for oh photoproduction as discussed elsewhere none of the waters contain 0 5 mm nitrate omitted from table 1 for simplicity which is necessary for its importance in oh production miller and chin 2005 and thus nitrate is not considered in the following text 3 2 the impact of added fe on ac degradation and oh production as described below we presented kexp ac and rprod as a function of feadded in the form of ferric salt fet fenative feadded in selected water samples from neutral to highly acidic ph to explore the potential for enhancing ac photodegradation ph affects fe solubility complexation and redox potential and is often considered an important factor in the photoproduction of oh remucal and sedlak 2011 although not fully understood quantitatively with an increase in ph the speciation of fe iii and the photoproduced fe ii in wetland waters will switch from free fe3 and fe2 to inorganic complexes such as feoh2 and feoh and organic complexes such as fe dom changing their redox reactivity emmenegger et al 1998 fukushima et al 2001 rose and waite 2003 the role of dom which participates in both oh production via fe complexation or h2o2 production and oh scavenging were also explored under different ph scenarios 3 2 1 iron amendment under neutral ph 7 6 conditions the degradation of ac in owc and wf with different feadded 0 5 and 10 μm was monitored at the native ph of the waters as shown in fig 1 a ac degraded with a similar rate half life 40 h in owc and wf in the absence of added fe and is about twice its direct photolysis rate half life 90 h langlois et al 2014 the dominant mechanism for ac indirect photolysis is dependent on water chemistry for example langlois et al 2014 reported that oh accounted for almost all indirect photolysis of ac in everglades water ph 7 9 fenative 1 1 μm doc 25 mg c l 1 by using t butanol as a oh quencher our waters were very similar to that study as far as ph and fe are concerned and thus reaction with oh is assumed the most important pathway for ac indirect photolysis the production rates of the carbonate radical co3 from the reaction between oh and hco3 is about 5 20 of the production rates of oh rprod in our waters although co3 had higher steady state concentrations relative to oh co3 ss 5 10 14 2 10 13 m vs oh ss 5 10 16 2 10 15 m both determined in our waters see details on oh ss calculations in the methods section and co3 ss calculations in text s4 larson and zepp 1988 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 it is more than 3 orders of magnitude less reactive k co 3 a c 1 1 0 5 106 m 1s 1 zeng and arnold 2013 towards ac relative to oh as a result co3 contributes 3 of ac s photofate and is not considered further in this study non oh relevant reactive intermediates such as excited triplet dom and singlet oxygen even if they were unneglectable in our system do not usually change with fe addition and therefore have no effect on our data interpretation the lack of change in kexp ac with increasing fe in fig 1a clearly shows that the addition of fe iii to the wetland waters at their natural ph does not change ac degradation rates this result implies that similar levels of oh ss exist across the tested fe concentrations if we assume that oh scavenging does not change dramatically with fe addition as dom and bicarbonate are its major scavengers we would have consistent rprod oh photoproduction rate for owc and wf with increasing fe as was verified experimentally fig 1b the impact of fe addition on rprod in fulvic acid solutions is slightly different compared to whole waters fig 1b there is a noticeable increase in rprod between 0 μm and 2 μm feadded especially for srfa fig 1b the rate at 2 μm feadded in the srfa experiment appears to be an outlier and we currently have no plausible explanation for this difference thus this data point was not considered for our analysis similar experiments at ph 7 fig s4 also showed greater enhancement for srfa relative to plfa the outliner at 2 μm feadded was again observed with srfa at ph 7 although to a lesser degree it appears that most of the enhancement occurred between 0 and 2 μm fet while higher fet showed no further effect this could explain why we observed no significant changes in kexp ac and rprod for owc and wf since fenative already exceeds the optimal fe concentration therefore at neutral ph values an increase of fet to 2 μm may be beneficial 10 increase in oh production with plfa and 60 with srfa for wetlands that lack sufficient natural levels of iron before irradiation the native and added fe iii is largely complexed with dom fe iii dom equation 7 the mechanism behind the formation of oh at neutral ph has been proposed to be the photo fenton reaction equation 6 pignatello et al 2006 vermilyea and voelker 2009 although this process is usually optimized under acidic conditions ph 2 3 and partially due to higher fe solubility and slow dioxygen oxidation kinetics the presence of dom in wetland waters greatly enhanced fe iii solubility by complexation at neutral ph xiao et al 2013 nevertheless colloid fe iii is also likely present depending on its formation rate in our test waters pullin and cabaniss 2003 upon solar irradiation both reactants in the fenton process fe ii and h2o2 may be photochemically produced with fe ii formed by ligand to metal charge transfer from its dom complex equation 7 and h2o2 produced from photoexcited charge separated species within dom followed by o2 dismutation equations 8 and 10 zhang et al 2012 being redox active fe usually functions as a catalyst in whole fenton series reactions at neutral ph the competition from o2 equation 9 for photo produced fe ii lowers the oh generation rate as compared to moderately acidic ph 6 7 f e i i i d o m h v f e i i d o m o x 8 9 10 the above mechanism shows that dom is a key factor in generating both fe ii and h2o2 in fig 1b negligible rprod in bicarbonate buffered deionized water mq with fet 0 and 10 μm confirmed the importance of dom to rprod while a full kinetic model cannot be derived due to a lack of accurate rate and equilibrium constants for fe dom complexes a simple mass balance based model tentatively explains why there is a limiting concentration for fe enhancement 11 12 r h 2 o 2 a b s d o m φ h 2 o 2 13 y c r a t e o f h 2 o 2 c o n s u m p t i o n i n r e a c t i o n w i t h f e r h 2 o 2 14 both the fe independent photolysis rnonfe and the fe dependent reaction i e the photo fenton reaction rfenton in this case contribute to rprod although alternative fe dependent reaction pathways e g complexation between fe and dom may enhance oh production from dom may occur we lack the evidence for their existence based on a mass balance rfenton is limited by the production of h2o2 r h 2 o 2 which is a product of the light absorption flux by dom abs dom and h2o2 quantum yield φ h 2 o 2 equation 12 multiplied by the fraction of h2o2 that reacts with fe yc equation 13 and the yield of oh y oh equation 14 we assume that rnonfe r h 2 o 2 and y oh are independent of fet at a certain ph and therefore the addition of fe may only change yc according to the fenton reaction equation 6 yc is proportional to fe ii which depends on fet and competition from oxidation by o2 equations 7 and 9 once yc reaches unity i e fe ii is high enough to outcompete other h2o2 sinks rfenton approaches a maximum of r h 2 o 2 y oh see equation 11 and the increase in fet no longer changes rprod the comparison of the fe assisted maximum oh production between different waters revealed this trend wf srfa plfa owc fig 1b this trend is ascribed to differences in rnonfe r h 2 o 2 and or y oh because srfa and plfa had similar rnonfe fig 1b when fet 0 the difference between them can be attributed to r h 2 o 2 and or y oh among the two terms r h 2 o 2 is higher for srfa due to its higher light absorbance abs dom table 1 and φ h 2 o 2 estimated from its lower e2 e3 ratio in table 1 which is negatively correlated to φ h 2 o 2 dalrymple et al 2010 y oh on the other hand is harder to predict the only relevant reported y oh for photo fenton reaction is 0 26 0 13 for srfa at ph of 7 vermilyea and voelker 2009 however no comparison could be made for plfa or other waters samples y oh may be greatly affected by ph and fe ii complexation and perhaps the microenvironment of the fenton reaction equation 6 miller et al 2016 2013 remucal and sedlak 2011 3 2 2 hydroxyl radical production under moderately acidic ph 5 conditions under moderately acidic ph both the oh production and its induced ac degradation were faster compared to those at neutral ph fig 1 the benefit of fe amendment also becomes more apparent an increase of 50 and 100 respectively in the ac degradation rate was observed for wf and owc from 0 to up to 10 μm of feadded fig 1c there is no statistical difference between 5 and 10 μm feadded or 6 and 11 μm fet indicating an optimal fe concentration is reached when fet 6 μm as for the rprod depicted in fig 1d all tested waters show a continuous increase in rprod with a possible plateau 11 μm fet therefore for moderately acidic waters with low fet 1 μm adding a few μm feadded has the potential to double or even triple oh production allowing for an increase in herbicide degradation fe iii at ph 5 is mostly complexed with dom while only a small portion fe ii is complexed due to less favorable binding to carboxylate based functional groups which favor hard acids such as fe iii voelker and sulzberger 1996 the mechanism behind oh production at around ph 5 is likely to be similar to neutral ph described above but with altered rate constants especially k o 2 for equation 9 equation 11 is used again to shed light on the role of ph on oh production rnonfe is only doubled at ph 5 compared to ph 7 6 for srfa and plfa fig 1b and d however maximum rfe is approximately one order of magnitude higher at ph 5 compared to ph 7 6 the decrease in ph tends to slightly decrease φ h 2 o 2 dalrymple et al 2010 laszakovits 2016 which is in contrast to the significant increases in rfe negligible changes in abs dom also do not explain the ph dependence on rfe the remaining terms to influence rfe are yc and y oh the oxidation of fe ii by oxygen which could otherwise react with h2o2 to form oh is significantly less favorable at lower ph miller et al 1995 as a result yc may be much higher at ph 5 at low fet 11 μm with the increase of fet yc reaches unity and rfe reaches its maximum and the one order of magnitude increase in rfe from neutral to moderately acidic ph values could only be ascribed to y oh although more research needs to be done low ph or complexation with organic ligands tends to increase y oh miller et al 2016 2013 remucal and sedlak 2011 our experimental data of higher rprod and kexp ac at ph 5 compared to ph 7 6 demonstrates that lowering ph plays an important role in y oh 3 2 3 hydroxyl radical production under highly acidic ph 2 7 conditions the amd impacted el sample shows high reactivity towards ac degradation as depicted in fig 2 which is two orders of magnitude higher than that at moderately acidic ph fig 1c we determined the impact of fe addition on ac degradation with both owc water and a mq control in contrast to higher ph values where the addition of fe in mq tends to have no enhancement fig 1b and d the first order rate constants increased with the addition of fe almost linearly for both mq and owc fig 2 no plateau was reached for the highest concentration tested 500 μm fet the owc water showed much less reactivity compared to mq this decreased reactivity is in contrast to the greater h2o2 production from dom photolysis in owc water and is mainly ascribed to higher oh scavenging and light screening in owc water higher reactivity with mq also suggests that the aforementioned photo fenton reaction is no longer an important pathway at this ph correspondingly the oh production rate was only determined for the el water rprod was 8340 780 nm min 1 oh scavenging rate was 5 5 4 3 104 s 1 and oh ss was 2 5 2 0 10 12 m with this high oh induced reactivity amd impacted water or similarly engineered water treatment systems may serve as an available and economic reservoir for treatment of agricultural runoff resulting in pesticide half lives on the order of minutes under natural sunlight at ph 2 7 fet is in the form of feoh2 in sulfate poor waters mq and owc and feso4 and feoh2 in the el sample before irradiation the mechanism of oh production in iron rich highly acidic waters does not require dom as it does at higher ph values instead oh production is largely due to the photochemical reaction of fe iii hydroxy complexes particularly feoh2 allen et al 1996 15 whose fractional concentration e g 8 in el enough for high oh production strongly depends on ph and the available inorganic ligands such as sulfate e g 20 mm in el and complexed with 80 of fe iii photo fenton reactions equations 6 10 are usually optimized at highly acidic ph however lacking an external source of h2o2 in this study the initial oh production rate from photo fenton reactions is limited by in situ h2o2 production r h 2 o 2 from dom photolysis r h 2 o 2 ranges from 10 3 102 nm min 1 avery et al 2005 cooper et al 1988 vermilyea and voelker 2009 which is orders of magnitude lower than the measured production of oh in this study fig 2 this difference is not surprising since both the quantum yield of h2o2 10 3 10 4 from dom and the light absorption by dom are much lower than the quantum yield of oh 10 2 10 1 and light absorption by feoh2 dalrymple et al 2010 kieber et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 although not formed initially from dom photolysis h2o2 may be formed from o2 and carbon centered radicals in the later stages of irradiation sun and pignatello 1993 nevertheless at highly acidic ph values the oh production was initiated from feoh2 photolysis and supplemented by photo fenton reactions at a later stage 3 3 comparison of experimental and calculated ac degradation rate at different ph values we estimated kac based on rprod with the knowledge of both oh production and ac degradation rate constants and this method may be used to predict the fate of other pesticides if their second order oh rate constants are known ac degradation rate constants were calculated as a summation of oh induced photolysis k oh ac using the experimental rprod and the screening factor adjusted direct photolysis kdir ac sf comparison at ph 2 7 was not included in this analysis due to differences in oh measurement methods and its large 95 confidence intervals fig 3 shows k oh ac kdir ac sf kexp ac for almost all conditions at both ph 5 and 7 6 the magnitude of these differences k oh ac kdir ac sf kexp ac kexp ac was 50 100 at ph of 7 6 and 50 200 at ph of 5 to address these discrepancies we may have underestimated the oh scavenging rates for the dom used in this study we assumed that they would fall within the range reported by brezonik and fulkerson brekken 1998 1 4 3 3 104 l mg c 1 s 1 but others have reported a somewhat greater range of dom scavenging rate constants typically 1 7 104 l mg c 1 s 1 depending on the dom used and oh production mechanisms page et al 2010 rosario ortiz et al 2008 westerhoff et al 2007 1999 nevertheless in order to manipulate the model so estimates are in agreement with kexp ac it would require dom scavenging rate constants on the order of 6 15 104 l mg c 1 s 1 while possible at the lower end of this enhanced range we believe it unlikely to explain the discrepancies between model predictions and our observations the second reason for the model discrepancy is that the yield of htpa in the presence of photo irradiated fe and our dom is much higher than 0 35 charbouillot et al 2011 determined the htpa yield to be somewhat smaller 0 15 0 30 depending on ph and temperature and the impact of organic acids such as acetic acid was insignificant in aqueous media in equilibrium with air irradiated srfa spiked with fe has been shown to reduce the phenol yield from reaction between benzene and oh by half vermilyea and voelker 2009 the same mechanism may apply to the yield of htpa which would enlarge the model discrepancy an increase in htpa yield to 0 85 has been observed when strong oxidants like ircl 6 2 was used in place of o2 mark et al 1998 however no such oxidants existed in our system and we consider this hypothesis highly unlikely a third reason may be due to the side reactions emanating from the oh probe tpa the 1 mm tpa may produce additional h2o2 upon photoexcitation by the uv portion of sunlight the carboxyl groups on tpa may also bind fe iii and promote ligand to metal charge transfer for the photo reduction of fe iii both mechanisms may increase the oh production rate to above that anticipated for irradiated fe and dom future experiments capable of measuring nm level of h2o2 and fe ii may help to test this hypothesis our final explanation lies in the heterogeneity of reactive hydroxylating species and the reaction selectiveness towards these species by different probe compounds such as tpa and ac free oh low energy hydroxylation and higher oxidation state fe species such as fe iv are among the hydroxylating species generated by the photolysis of dom and fe the formation of fe iv in particular has been proposed in fenton type reactions at circumneutral ph values gallard et al 1998 lee et al 2013 remucal and sedlak 2011 if fe iv was produced in our system and if tpa has a higher reactivity towards this species relative to ac this may result in over estimates of kexp ac vione et al 2014 suggested that tpa compared to electron rich aromatic compounds ac in this case tends to react faster with fe iv than with oh corroborating with our assumption if fe iv was formed y oh equation 14 would be 1 in contrast to the discussion earlier no strong ph dependence of y oh was found in fig 3 4 conclusions the effectiveness of fe assisted ac degradation and oh production in studied wetland waters without external h2o2 addition was first explored in this study the efficacy of this process increased with decreasing ph as a result of different reaction mechanisms i e the photo fenton reactions under mildly acidic to circumneutral conditions and the photolysis of fe iii aquo complexes under highly acidic ph waters adding fe in the form of fe iii salts was beneficial in certain situations at neutral ph 7 6 when fet is 1 μm the addition of fe to fet of 1 2 μm could increase the degradation of ac by tens of percent under moderately acidic conditions ph 5 when fet is 1 μm addition of fe to fet of 6 11 μm may increase ac photo attenuation by 50 100 for amd impacted waters where the ph is highly acidic 2 7 and fe iii is on the order of 100 μm ac was completely degraded in a few minutes under natural sunlight however the efficiency of this the aforementioned processes at different ph levels are also highly dependent upon the amount and type of dom present in the surface waters at neutral ph terrestrial dom e g srfa would favor the fe assisted oh production relative to microbially derived dom e g plfa this was not observed for moderately acidic ph waters where both dom promote similar enhancement at ph 2 7 dom inhibited fe assisted herbicide degradation this study may shed light on selecting the right ph and fe concentration for future field applications when fe amendment is likely to be beneficial in particular amd waters have beneficial reuse potential for their ability to photo generate high levels of oh resulting in the rapid degradation of organic contaminants such as herbicides acknowledgement this work was supported by the ohio water development authority 4968 and

water treatment plants due to its high and consistent copy numbers in source water graphical abstract image 1 keywords virus reduction quantitative pcr drinking water treatment plant pepper mild mottle virus indicator 1 introduction microbial safety management of drinking water has been changed after cryptosporidium caused several outbreaks worldwide in the 1990s mackenzie et al 1994 due to its tolerance to chlorine in japan the interim guideline for cryptosporidium treatment in the water supply was established in 1996 and reformed in 2007 where a strict turbidity control policy was employed as a critical control parameter not to exceed 0 1 approximately 0 14 ntu after filtration treatment careful operation has been in practice including minute control of the coagulant dosage re addition of a small amount of coagulant after sedimentation before sand filtration and initiation at a lower flow rate after backwashing of the sand filter no outbreaks of cryptosporidium via the water supply have been reported in japan since implementation of the guideline yet its efficiency at protecting the drinking water supply from enteric viruses which may more easily pass through coagulation sedimentation and filtration process due to their small size remains uncertain as a means of managing the risk of illness due to public consumption of drinking water quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra has been conducted masago et al 2006 smeets et al 2009 and is also included in the water safety plan recommended by the world health organization who 2011 in qmra processes log10 reduction values lrvs corresponding to viruses reduced in each treatment process are a key parameter in assessing the virus concentration in treated water using pathogen levels determined from raw

shin and sobsey 2015 shirasaki et al 2010 virus reduction in the laboratory may not fully represent reduction in full scale dwtps medema et al 2006 in a qmra in the netherlands plant scale data were preferred followed by pilot plant scale data over data from laboratory experiments schijven et al 2011 studies associated with virus reduction at full scale dwtps have been limited so far due to the challenges of detecting low concentration of viruses in water albinana gimenez et al 2009 asami et al 2016 where a large volume of water samples must be concentrated during virus concentration procedures polymerase chain reaction pcr inhibiting substances are co concentrated with viruses and interfere with the following molecular methods rna extraction reverse transcription rt and quantitative pcr qpcr many researchers have dealt with this problem schrader et al 2012 and pcr inhibition was found to be caused mainly by low molecular weight organic fractions hata et al 2015a although some procedures have effectively removed or mitigated pcr inhibition gibson et al 2012 hata et al 2011 a common strategy that mitigates pcr inhibition has not been widely established recently asami et al 2016 quantified the reduction efficiency of viruses at a full scale dwtp located in bangkok thailand using indigenous pepper mild mottle virus pmmov and jc polyomavirus jc pyv as treatment process indicators however virus reduction during water treatment in japan may be different from that of other countries given the previously mentioned strict turbidity control policy for cryptosporidium safety management therefore it is necessary to monitor virus reduction for japanese water treatment systems specifically to observe the fate of enteric viruses in water indicator viruses are often targeted due to their higher relative concentration compared with low concentration indigenous enteric viruses in the source and treated water haramoto et al 2004 kittigul et al 2012 recently a number of studies have compared the prevalence of pmmov to enteric viruses in feces wastewater and environmental waters rosario et al 2009 zhang et al 2006 asami et al 2016 hamza et al 2011 haramoto et al 2013 kuroda et al 2015 rachmadi et al 2016 pmmov showed greater persistence than human enteric viruses in surface water symonds et al 2016 wastewater kitajima et al 2014b schmitz et al 2016 symonds et al 2015 2014 in wetland treatment rachmadi et al 2016 and in membrane filtration shirasaki et al 2017 this suggest pmmov is useful as an indicator representing the efficiency of virus removal via a treatment process however the efficiency of a drinking water treatment process at reducing pmmov in comparison with enteric viruses including human noroviruses one of the major causes of waterborne nonbacterial gastroenteritis maunula et al 2005 parshionikar et al 2003 has not yet been examined since pmmov and enteric viruses are different from a morphological viewpoint it is necessary to evaluate whether pmmov can act as an indicator of the presence of enteric viruses noroviruses which are found in water and cause waterborne disease are the most common cause of pediatric gastroenteritis katayama and vinje 2017 for this reason norovirus genotype ii nov gii was used as a reference pathogen for comparison with pmmov in this study instead of using other surrogates abbaszadegan et al 2008 bae and schwab 2008 boudaud et al 2012 for the bench scale experiments in this study several reference indicators were adopted to compare their reduction during the treatments with that of pmmov murine norovirus mnv often used as a human norovirus surrogate aichivirus aiv as one of the most prevalent virus in water environment ms2 and qβ the most widely used bacteriophages used as virus indicators in water treatment studies and e coli which is used as a fecal indicator to overcome the difficulty in measuring low concentration of indigenous viruses in water we needed to investigate how to measure remove or mitigate pcr inhibition cucumber green mottle mosaic virus cgmmv which like pmmov belongs to the tobamovirus group was introduced as a molecular control due to its phylogenetical and morphological similarity to the target virus i e pmmov our study was composed of two main parts a bench scale experiment using coagulation sedimentation cs and rapid sand filtration rsf as well as a field survey at full scale dwtps the aim of the bench scale experiment was to evaluate the behavior of pmmov as a treatment process indicator for enteric viruses including human norovirus the aims of the full scale dwtp survey were 1 to investigate whether the indigenous pmmov copy number in rw was high enough to evaluate the stepwise virus reduction efficiency in dwtps 2 to evaluate the molecular detection inhibition caused by co concentrated organic matter and to verify methods to mitigate this inhibition and 3 to evaluate the virus reduction efficiency of cs ozone

qpcr efficiency in order to evaluate rna extraction and rt qpcr efficiency cgmmv provided by the national institute of agrobiological sciences nias japan was added as a molecular control based on its phylogenetic and morphological similarity to the target virus pmmov although mnv has been widely introduced as a molecular control in previous studies asami et al 2016 kitajima et al 2014a it is phylogenetically and morphologically different from pmmov thus cgmmv which has higher similarity to pmmov was chosen as a more appropriate molecular control for this study briefly 1 0 μl of cgmmv was added into all concentrated water samples as wll as a control sample with 140 μl of dnase rnase free distilled water to obtain a final copy number of approximately 105 copies per sample as described

significant difference between log10 reductions comparing the tested parameters 2 3 bench scale experiment 2 3 1 preparation of microbes for the spike experiment one milliliter of e coli k12 ifo3301 institute for fermentation japan was inoculated into 9 ml of lysogeny broth invitrogen usa to obtain approximately 10 ml of cultured solution this culture was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min to pellet the bacteria the supernatant was removed and the pelleted bacteria were resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate buffered saline this wash process was repeated three times bacteriophage qβ atcc 23631

an infected patient purified by ultracentrifugation with cscl density gradient pmmov and its host nicotiana benthamiana were provided by the national agriculture and food research organization japan 2 3 2 bench scale cs experiment sixty liters of raw water rw were collected monthly from august to december 2016 at plant b on the same day of full scale dwtp sampling transferred to a laboratory at the university of tokyo japan and subjected to bench scale water treatment in the laboratory within the sampling day the cs laboratory experiment was conducted using 40 l of the collected plant b rw the following microbes were added into the rw after equilibrating to room temperature 15 25 c 10 ml of e coli ifo3301 up to 2 ml each of pmmov bacteriophage qβ ms2 aiv mnv final concentration 103 copy ml and nov gii pacl basicity 54 provided by plant b was used for the coagulation experiments the ph was adjusted to approximately 7 0 using h2so4 while mixing with a stirrer the dose rate of h2so4 and pacl 17 40 mg l followed the actual treatment condition of plant b on the same sampling day cs was conducted in accordance with the jar test condition of plant b with slight modification of the settling time because the test water volume in our study was different from the jar test in plant b briefly after coagulant addition the test water was mixed rapidly for 2 min 120 rpm and slowly for 10 min 60 rpm and then left for 15 min for floc settling supernatants were collected after settling of which 2000 ml 50 ml and 350 ml were used to quantify the virus detect e coli and analyze basic water quality respectively 2 3 3 bench scale rsf experiment the sand filtration column and treatment condition were designed in accordance with design criteria for waterworks facilities in japan standardized sand effective diameter 0 6 mm uniformity coefficient 1 5 nihon genryo japan was used as a filter media in the rsf process to obtain a 65 cm filter depth in a 8 cm diameter tubular tower with a gravel layer basement flow rate was adjusted to 120 150 m day 0 13 0 18 cm s in this experimental condition using a peristaltic pump the sand filtration column was backwashed with 60 l of tap water after each experiment to reset the media condition and was saturated with tap water after resetting the media condition the virus copy number in filtered tap water was confirmed to be below the detection limit or at a negligible level compared to the virus concentration of the sample water data not shown to evaluate the step wise reduction of microbes by cs and rsf in a similar fashion to a full scale system water from the finished cs experiment was used for the influent of the sand filtration column filtered water samples were collected after 15 l of supernatant was filtered in order to avoid the effect of the tap water being saturated in the column prior to the experiment 2 3 4 sample collection water samples were collected at each step of rw treatment after each of the following steps addition of microbes n 5 cs n 5 and rsf n 5 sample concentration steps are explained below concentrated sample volumes were 500 ml for rw and 1000 ml for both post cs and post rsf indigenous virus copy number in the rw before addition of experimental viruses was determined for every sampling occasion and was found to be negligible compared with that of the inoculated viruses data not shown 2 3 5 virus concentration method water samples were concentrated using two different primary concentration methods 1 an acid rinse alkaline elution method using an electronegative membrane filter as previously described katayama et al 2002 and 2 a slightly modified method briefly for method 1 mgcl2 was added to the water sample to obtain a final concentration of 25 mmol l and the samples were passed through an electronegative membrane ha 90 mm diameter 0 45 μm pore millipore tokyo japan magnesium ions were then removed by passing 200 ml of 0 5 mmol l h2so4 through the membrane acid rinse viruses adsorbed on the filter were eluted using 10 ml of 1 0 mmol l naoh alkaline elution the eluate was recovered in a plastic tube containing 50 μl of 0 5 mol l h2so4 and 100 μl of 100 tris edta buffer ph 8 0 for neutralization and further concentrated using a centriprep ym 50 filter unit merck millipore japan to obtain a final volume of approximately 700 μl for method 2 a slight modification for the primary virus concentration step was performed a previous study reported that it was sometimes difficult to elute viruses adsorbed on membrane filters simply through filtration with naoh ahmed et al 2015 specifically in the current study it is possible that the coagulant remaining after cs could interfere with the virus concentration especially the alkaline elution process therefore instead of adding mgcl2 ph levels of the water samples were adjusted to acid condition ph 3 5 using 0 5 mol l h2so4 in order to dissolve the aluminum coagulant and the water samples were then passed through an electronegative membrane the subsequent procedure was the same as that of the original method and resulted in a final volume of approximately 700 μl the virus copy number of each sample was determined using both primary concentration methods the highest virus copy number obtained in each of the two methods was used for subsequent analysis 2 4 full scale dwtp sampling 2 4 1 water samples tested water samples were collected monthly from december 2015 to november 2016 at plant a and from march 2016 to january 2017 at plant b both of which are located in an urban area of japan these dwtps receive river water and produce yearly averages of 7 9 105 m3 plant a and 9 4 105 m3 plant b of drinking water per day the characteristics of these dwtps as well as sampling points are shown in fig 1 chlorine was injected before cs from december to march at both dwtps polyaluminum chloride pacl was used as a coagulant at both plants at a range of 17 40 mg l a small amount of coagulant 1 mg l was re added before rsf at plant a and before secondary rsf at plant b to enhance the treatment efficiency of rsf at plant a samples were collected once a month from rw n 13 from post cs n 13 from post ozone n 13 from post bac n 13 and from post rsf n 13 to evaluate the reduction efficiency of viruses through the whole treatment process including advanced treatment processes at plant b samples were collected from rw n 11 from post cs n 11 and from post primary rsf n 11 to evaluate the virus reduction efficiency samples were collected sequentially in the order of the treatment sequence from rw to after treatments on the same day but with shorter intervals than the hydraulic retention time of each treatment 2 4 2 onsite virus concentration method large volume water samples 20 l for rw 100 l for post cs and 500 l for treated water were concentrated by the acid rinse alkaline elution method with a cartridge type electronegative filter on site as described previously hata et al 2015b and stored at 4 c for further analysis for the rw samples the 20 l water sample was collected in a gamma sterilized container and mgcl2 was added directly to obtain a final concentration of 25 mmol l for other samples water samples were mixed with mgcl2 continuously by gravity flow to obtain a final concentration of 25 mmol l and this was passed through an electronegative membrane filter asami et al 2016 viral rna was extracted from concentrated samples subjected to rt and quantified by qpcr as described in sections 2 2 2 2 4 3 large volume primary virus concentration method efficiency due to the fact that the target dwtps used pacl as a coagulant which may interfere with the electrostatic nature of the virus concentration method it was important to determine the virus concentration efficiency recovery yield for the large volume primary virus concentration method used in this study however the concentration method for dwtp samples requires hundreds of liters of water leading to difficulties performing the virus spiking experiment for direct evaluation of the recovery yield therefore a one hundredth scale laboratory experiment was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the primary virus concentration method from march 2016 to january 2017 the same virus concentration method described in the previous section was used in this recovery experiment water samples were collected on each sampling occasion in a sterilized plastic bag and transported to the laboratory in a cooler with ice packs pmmov was added into the water samples to obtain a final copy number of approximately 106 107 copies per sample sample volumes in the recovery experiment were calculated as one hundredth of the actual dwtp sample volumes similarly electronegative membrane filter used for the recovery experiment ha 47 mm diameter 0 45 μm pore millipore japan had an approximately 100 fold reduced area 9 6 cm2 compared to the cartridge type filter used for the dwtp samples 1000 cm2 filtration area subsequent processes were completed as described previously section 2 3 5 method 1 to obtain 10 ml of the primary concentrate recovery yield y was calculated as follows y x c0 v 100 y recovery yield of the primary concentration method x recovered pmmov copy number copies c0 stock pmmov copy number added into test water copy μl v added stock pmmov volume μl finally the geometric mean of y was calculated to evaluate the recovery tendency of the primary virus concentration 2 4 4 evaluation of viral rna extraction and rt qpcr efficiency viral rna extraction and rt qpcr efficiency for the full scale plant samples were evaluated as described in section 2 2 3 when the mme value was lower than 10 the water sample was subjected to a subsequent sample purification process described below 2 4 5 sample purification and dilution to mitigate the inhibition of viral detection dilution or sample purification was applied to inhibited samples mme 10 prior to the molecular methods according to a previous study gibson et al 2012 sample dilution prior to rt qpcr can effectively mitigate inhibition in addition a purification method used to remove humic acids from nucleic acid extracts using the polymeric adsorbent supelite dax 8 was employed which was developed previously schriewer et al 2011 and modified by dr akihiko hata private communication briefly a hydrophobic resin dax 8 was purified following the method described by thurman and malcolm 1981 and stored in an equal volume of 99 5 ethanol the mixture of dax 8 ethanol was introduced to the rna extraction process as described in a previous study asami et al 2016 the mixture of dax 8 ethanol was combined at a ratio of 1 1 with 140 μl of the concentrated sample and mixed well the dax 8 sample mixture was filtered using an ultrafree centrifugal filter unit pvdf 0 45 μm pore size millipore this primary filtrate was then combined with 560 μl of lysis buffer buffer avl provided with the rna extraction kit mentioned previously in addition 560 μl of buffer avl was mixed with the dax 8 resin retained in the filter unit and incubated for 10 min at room temperature 15 25 c from which secondary filtrate was recovered in the filter unit this secondary filtrate was then combined with the primary filtrate buffer avl mixture the combined primary and secondary filtrate was subjected to rna extraction as described above the extracted rna was additionally subjected to gel filtration chromatography using illustra microspin s 300 hr columns exclusion limit 118 bp 70 kda ge healthcare to remove low molecular weight organic matter following the manufacturer s protocol a flow chart depicting the determination of the virus copy number in samples corresponding to the extent of inhibition is shown in fig 2 first the virus copy number in the sample and the mme value with and without 10 dilution prior to rt qpcr were determined step 1 when the mme value of the sample was greater than 10 the higher value for either condition with or without 10 dilution was adopted as an indigenous pmmov copy number for analysis even if the indigenous pmmov copy number was negative or below the quantification limit in cases where both mme values with and without 10 dilution were greater than 10 the higher pmmov copy number was used for analysis if both mme values were less than 10 extracted rna was subjected to 100 dilution prior to rt qpcr and judged in the same manner as step 1 step 2 if mme values remained less than 10 for 100 diluted samples these were then subjected to dax 8 treatment with and without 10 dilution prior to rna extraction and judged in the same manner as step 1 step 3 in cases where all of the mme values remained less than 10 the highest indigenous pmmov copy number obtained was used for analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 bench scale experiment the ranges of temperature ph turbidity ec and e coli in the test waters table a2 showed fluctuations in all water quality parameters during the sampling period likely due to seasonality and rainfall this experiment was conducted from summer august to winter december in japan including one sampling day immediately after a typhoon august fig 3 shows lrvs of viruses e coli and turbidity in cs and rsf respectively in the bench scale experiment data from one sampling day after the typhoon are shown in a separate bar due to the great differences observed in rw quality turbidity 100 ntu average virus lrvs by cs with the exception of the typhoon period were as follows pmmov 1 96 0 30 log10 aiv 1 83 0 27 log10 mnv 1 86 0 37 log10 nov gii 1 86 0 61 log10 qβ 1 42 0 27 log10 ms2 1 44 0 41 log10 mean standard deviation sd n 4 for each and were higher than those values from the typhoon period for all viruses average virus lrvs in rsf with the exception of the typhoon period were as follows pmmov 0 26 0 38 log10 aiv 0 62 0 49 log10 mnv 0 40 0 63 log10 nov gii 0 28 0 46 log10 qβ 0 10 0 32 log10 ms2 0 99 0 45 log10 mean sd n 4 in the august sample affected by the typhoon less removal via cs but greater removal via rsf was observed the turbidity in rw was much different from that of other samples which may have caused the change in interaction between coagulants and viruses despite the fact that coagulant dosage was adjusted based on the jar test it is possible that the reduction tendency in each treatment process was affected by the rw quality hereinafter the analysis was conducted using all data except that affected by the typhoon the removal of nov gii in cs in this study was greater than that of nov gi 1 5 log10 using alum shin and sobsey 2015 or recombinant norovirus virus like particles approximately 1 log10 using pacl alum or fecl3 shirasaki et al 2010 the range of pmmov lrvs was quite similar to those of enteric viruses tested including nov gii the lrvs for pmmov and nov gii were not significantly different for cs and rsf t test p 05 positive correlations between the pmmov and nov gii lrvs in cs and rsf were also found r 0 72 y 1 45 x 0 98 for cs r 0 86 y 1 03 x 0 02 for rsf x represents pmmov lrvs y represents nov gii lrvs the log10 reductions in aiv mnv qβ ms2 as well as nov gii in cs and rsf were more similar to that of pmmov than to that of e coli or turbidity except for qβ log10 reductions in rsf which was not determined these results suggest that pmmov may be a useful treatment process indicator of nov gii in cs and rsf processes 3 2 full scale dwtps experiment 3 2 1 indicator bacteria and physicochemical parameters at full scale dwtps the ranges of temperature ph turbidity ec e coli and total coliforms in full scale dwtps are shown in table a3 as described in section 3 1 fluctuations were observed in all water qualities during the sampling period especially in terms of concentration ranges of indicator bacteria turbidity which is adopted as a critical control parameter for cryptosporidium management for treatment processes in japan was reduced greatly in cs at both plants a and b the turbidity after rsf at plant a was less than 0 14 ntu on all sampling occasions whereas that of plant b sometimes exceeded 0 14 ntu in the latter case further treatment such as advanced treatment and secondary rsf are performed the effluent from secondary rsf is maintained below 0 14 ntu to meet the criteria 3 2 2 recovery yield of primary virus concentration for dwtp samples the recovery yields of primary virus concentration from dwtp samples one hundredth scale laboratory experiment are shown in fig 4 most recovery yields were larger than 10 showing that the method employed functioned efficiently rfs at plant a showed a remarkably low recovery yield this was suspected to be due to a high concentration of residual chlorine to assess this further post rsf samples collected at plant a in august october and november 2016 were dechlorinated with sodium thiosulfate and provided for recovery experiment the recovery yield of the dechlorinated sample was 101 7 0 28 n 3 which was much higher compared with that of the chlorinated control sample 10 0 26 0 53 n 3 because the recovery yield of cs at plant b was also less than 10 residual chlorine was likely the main cause of low recovery thus degradation of the virus by chlorination during the process of virus concentration should be considered when assessing the virus recovery yield in the laboratory because virus degradation by chlorine does not hinder virus recovery during the process of virus concentration primary virus concentrations for actual treatment plant samples were assumed to have performed well 3 2 3 viral rna extraction and rt qpcr efficiency using molecular control cgmmv in order to evaluate the efficiency of rna extraction and rt qpcr a known amount of cgmmv was added to concentrated samples as a molecular control pmmov copy number in the sample cp was determined in cases where the mme value was higher than 10 recovery of added cgmmv a total of 98 samples were subjected to rna extraction and rt qpcr with and without 10 dilution before the rt process step 1 cp values were determined in 81 samples 82 7 with either the diluted or undiluted samples showing mme values of 10 among the 81 samples cp was determined in 19 untreated samples and in 62 samples with 10 dilution table 1 the remaining 17 samples were subjected to rna extraction and rt qpcr with 100 dilution before the rt process step 2 however inhibition was mitigated in only two samples 2 17 11 8 with this treatment this result suggests that sample dilution before rt can effectively mitigate inhibition but mitigation was limited when the dilution factor was increased up to 100 the remaining 15 inhibited samples were subjected to dax 8 treatment with rna extraction followed by rt qpcr with and without 10 dilution before the rt process step 3 which was able to improve mme values to 10 for all the samples cp was determined in 5 samples with 10 dilution and 10 samples without dilution with the dax 8 treatment before rt according to our results inhibition was effectively removed by the dax 8 treatment when it was not simply mitigated via sample dilution after rna extraction which may indicate that the rna extraction step was inhibited i e rather than the rt step or the pcr in summary the evaluation of extraction rt qpcr efficiency via cgmmv molecular control demonstrated that inhibition was greatly mitigated by sample dilution before rt when inhibition was not mitigated by 10 dilution dax 8 treatment combined with the rna extraction step was sufficient to mitigate inhibition as a result inhibition was mitigated sufficiently in all samples thus enabling better quantification of target virus copy number 3 2 4 quantification of pmmov in water samples at dwtps pmmov copy number in a total of 98 samples was determined by rt qpcr positive ratio and quantified ratio are summarized in table a4 in our study when the copy number was higher than the quantification limit of one copy per well the value was regarded as quantified and when it was lower than the limit then it was regarded as positive but unquantified which was not used in the subsequent analysis all rw and post cs samples at plant a were quantified however the quantified positive ratio was largely decreased after the ozone process this finding suggests a substantial contribution of ozone in reducing virus copy number on the other hand all rw post cs and post rsf samples were quantifiable at plant b with the exception of one post cs sample pmmov copy number for each treatment process in two dwtps was summarized in fig 5 pmmov copy numbers mean sd were as follows 105 35 0 48 copies l plant a n 13 and 105 33 0 34 copies l plant b n 11 for rw samples 102 97 0 65 copies l plant a n 13 and 102 71 0 63 copies l plant b n 10 for post cs samples 100 91 0 84 copies l plant a n 5 for the post ozone sample 100 99 0 75 copies l plant a n 7 for the post bac sample and 101 23 0 42 copies l plant a n 4 and 102 32 0 84 copies l plant b n 11 for post rsf samples pmmov copy number in rw samples were stable and high enough to evaluate stepwise reduction efficiency throughout the year in both plants although the turbidity of the sand filtered water at plant a was controlled to less than 0 14 ntu on all sampling occasions pmmov was nevertheless detected in 61 5 8 13 of the filtrated samples indicating that the virus particles were not completely removed despite strict turbidity control therefore the ability to guarantee the elimination of viruses in tap water via simple regulation of turbidity of filtered water is limited in cases where rw has an extremely high virus concentration purified water is further chlorinated in japan to achieve a high level of safety against enteric viruses 3 2 5 reduction efficiency of pmmov indicator bacteria and turbidity the pmmov indicator bacteria and turbidity reduction efficiencies are shown in fig 6 whose number of samples used are shown in table a5 and their average copy numbers are shown in table a6 a previous study reported that the reduction efficiencies of pmmov in cs treatment were 0 40 0 17 log10 rainy season and 1 61 log10 dry season at a full scale dwtp in bangkok asami et al 2016 these values are much lower than those found in the current study the difference in reduction efficiency of cs can be explained by the use of different coagulant types pacl in this study and aluminum sulfate in the bangkok study as well as higher rw turbidity in bangkok according to previous studies pacl more effectively removed recombinant norovirus virus like particles and bacteriophage qβ in cs treatment than did aluminum shirasaki et al 2010 2014 moreover the treatment plants in our study used chlorine before the cs process leading to a greater virus reduction compared to the study conducted in bangkok a significant log10 reduction was observed during the ozone process for pmmov likely due to the strong potential for degradation of viral rna through oxidation a previous study reported the virus reduction efficiency of the ozone process at a full scale dwtp in spain albinana gimenez et al 2009 where the lrvs of human adenovirus and jc pyv by ozone were 3 15 and 1 95 log10 respectively although the target virus of their study was different from ours the reduction efficiency obtained in this study was in accordance with the range of the previous research the virus reduction of the ozone process can be underestimated when using a molecular detection method because it detects both intact virus and disinfected viruses when viral rna is preserved neglecting the effect of inactivation regardless of this for the case of ozone treatment virus reductions observed by rt pcr were reported similar to those detected by infectivity assay in a laboratory experiment shin and sobsey 2003 therefore the virus reduction by ozone obtained in our study could theoretically underestimate the actual amount of reduction due to disinfection but this is not always the case reduction efficiencies of bac and rsf were relatively low compared to those of cs or ozone the pmmov reduction efficiencies of rsf observed at a dwtp in bangkok asami et al 2016 were slightly higher 1 26 0 25 log10 for rainy season 0 78 log10 for dry season than those found in our study this can be explained by the fact that a greater portion of virus might be caught in small flocs which likely remained after the cs process at the dwtp in bangkok leading to a higher virus reduction during the rsf process the overall reductions of pmmov observed in our study were 3 80 0 77 log10 for plant a and 2 88 0 57 log10 for plant b most likely due to different timings of ozone treatments at the two plants since ozonation is applied to the first rsf filtrate at plant b i e after the sampling point of this study further reduction of viruses is expected comparing the reduction efficiency for pmmov with that of other indicators our results indicated that pmmov was most effectively removed by cs which is better than the reduction based on turbidity and indicator bacteria would imply in both plants a and b on the other hand it was most difficult to remove pmmov by rsf processes compared to turbidity and indicator bacteria in both plants suggesting that the behavior of the virus as a particle during treatment processes may differ from that of particle causing turbidity and indicator bacteria this highlights the importance of regulating virus removal not by observing indicator bacteria or turbidity but by observing the virus themselves 4 conclusions average pmmov log10 reduction for cs and rsf treatments were similar to other viral indicators including the reference enteric virus novgii analyzed pmmov can therefore be a useful treatment process indicator of nov gii removal in cs and rsf the indigenous pmmov copy number in river water was high enough to evaluate the stepwise reduction efficiency of drinking water treatment processes mean sd 105 05 0 48 copies l plant a n 13 and 105 03 0 34 copies l plant b n 11 rna extraction rt qpcr efficiency was evaluated using cgmmv as a process control for samples with less than 10 efficiency cgmmv quantification and thus rna extraction rt qpcr efficiency was improved by either 1 diluting the sample prior to rt or 2 dax 8 treatment during rna extraction based upon pmmov reductions cs and ozone treatments contributed the most to virus reduction at full scale dwtps with reductions of 2 38 0 74 log10 plant a n 13 and 2 63 0 76 log10 plant b n 10 for cs and 1 91 1 18 log10 plant a n 5 for ozone funding sources this research was supported by the tokyo metropolitan

water treatment plants due to its high and consistent copy numbers in source water graphical abstract image 1 keywords virus reduction quantitative pcr drinking water treatment plant pepper mild mottle virus indicator 1 introduction microbial safety management of drinking water has been changed after cryptosporidium caused several outbreaks worldwide in the 1990s mackenzie et al 1994 due to its tolerance to chlorine in japan the interim guideline for cryptosporidium treatment in the water supply was established in 1996 and reformed in 2007 where a strict turbidity control policy was employed as a critical control parameter not to exceed 0 1 approximately 0 14 ntu after filtration treatment careful operation has been in practice including minute control of the coagulant dosage re addition of a small amount of coagulant after sedimentation before sand filtration and initiation at a lower flow rate after backwashing of the sand filter no outbreaks of cryptosporidium via the water supply have been reported in japan since implementation of the guideline yet its efficiency at protecting the drinking water supply from enteric viruses which may more easily pass through coagulation sedimentation and filtration process due to their small size remains uncertain as a means of managing the risk of illness due to public consumption of drinking water quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra has been conducted masago et al 2006 smeets et al 2009 and is also included in the water safety plan recommended by the world health organization who 2011 in qmra processes log10 reduction values lrvs corresponding to viruses reduced in each treatment process are a key parameter in assessing the virus concentration in treated water using pathogen levels determined from raw water rw teunis et al 1997 although several studies have evaluated virus reduction in pilot or bench scale studies using test water spiked with viruses abbaszadegan et al 2007 2008 boudaud et al 2012 shin and sobsey 2015 shirasaki et al 2010 virus reduction in the laboratory may not fully represent reduction in full scale dwtps medema et al 2006 in a qmra in the netherlands plant scale data were preferred followed by pilot plant scale data over data from laboratory experiments schijven et al 2011 studies associated with virus reduction at full scale dwtps have been limited so far due to the challenges of detecting low concentration of viruses in water albinana gimenez et al 2009 asami et al 2016 where a large volume of water samples must be concentrated during virus concentration procedures polymerase chain reaction pcr inhibiting substances are co concentrated with viruses and interfere with the following molecular methods rna extraction reverse transcription rt and quantitative pcr qpcr many researchers have dealt with this problem schrader et al 2012 and pcr inhibition was found to be caused mainly by low molecular weight organic fractions hata et al 2015a although some procedures have effectively removed or mitigated pcr inhibition gibson et al 2012 hata et al 2011 a common strategy that mitigates pcr inhibition has not been widely established recently asami et al 2016 quantified the reduction efficiency of viruses at a full scale dwtp located in bangkok thailand using indigenous pepper mild mottle virus pmmov and jc polyomavirus jc pyv as treatment process indicators however virus reduction during water treatment in japan may be different from that of other countries given the previously mentioned strict turbidity control policy for cryptosporidium safety management therefore it is necessary to monitor virus reduction for japanese water treatment systems specifically to observe the fate of enteric viruses in water indicator viruses are often targeted due to their higher relative concentration compared with low concentration indigenous enteric viruses in the source and treated water haramoto et al 2004 kittigul et al 2012 recently a number of studies have compared the prevalence of pmmov to enteric viruses in feces wastewater and environmental waters rosario et al 2009 zhang et al 2006 asami et al 2016 hamza et al 2011 haramoto et al 2013 kuroda et al 2015 rachmadi et al 2016 pmmov showed greater persistence than human enteric viruses in surface water symonds et al 2016 wastewater kitajima et al 2014b schmitz et al 2016 symonds et al 2015 2014 in wetland treatment rachmadi et al 2016 and in membrane filtration shirasaki et al 2017 this suggest pmmov is useful as an indicator representing the efficiency of virus removal via a treatment process however the efficiency of a drinking water treatment process at reducing pmmov in comparison with enteric viruses including human noroviruses one of the major causes of waterborne nonbacterial gastroenteritis maunula et al 2005 parshionikar et al 2003 has not yet been examined since pmmov and enteric viruses are different from a morphological viewpoint it is necessary to evaluate whether pmmov can act as an indicator of the presence of enteric viruses noroviruses which are found in water and cause waterborne disease are the most common cause of pediatric gastroenteritis katayama and vinje 2017 for this reason norovirus genotype ii nov gii was used as a reference pathogen for comparison with pmmov in this study instead of using other surrogates abbaszadegan et al 2008 bae and schwab 2008 boudaud et al 2012 for the bench scale experiments in this study several reference indicators were adopted to compare their reduction during the treatments with that of pmmov murine norovirus mnv often used as a human norovirus surrogate aichivirus aiv as one of the most prevalent virus in water environment ms2 and qβ the most widely used bacteriophages used as virus indicators in water treatment studies and e coli which is used as a fecal indicator to overcome the difficulty in measuring low concentration of indigenous viruses in water we needed to investigate how to measure remove or mitigate pcr inhibition cucumber green mottle mosaic virus cgmmv which like pmmov belongs to the tobamovirus group was introduced as a molecular control due to its phylogenetical and morphological similarity to the target virus i e pmmov our study was composed of two main parts a bench scale experiment using coagulation sedimentation cs and rapid sand filtration rsf as well as a field survey at full scale dwtps the aim of the bench scale experiment was to evaluate the behavior of pmmov as a treatment process indicator for enteric viruses including human norovirus the aims of the full scale dwtp survey were 1 to investigate whether the indigenous pmmov copy number in rw was high enough to evaluate the stepwise virus reduction efficiency in dwtps 2 to evaluate the molecular detection inhibition caused by co concentrated organic matter and to verify methods to mitigate this inhibition and 3 to evaluate the virus reduction efficiency of cs ozone biological activated carbon bac and rsf process at two full scale dwtps under strict turbidity control in japan 2 material and methods 2 1 physicochemical water quality parameters water temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured immediately after collecting the samples using an hi 98129 water tester hanna japan turbidity was measured with a dr 890 portable colorimeter hach japan 2 2 quantification of microbes 2 2 1 quantification of indicator bacteria water samples containing chlorine were collected in plastic bags in which sodium thiosulfate was added in advance for dechlorination concentrations of e coli and total coliforms were quantified within 6 h of sample collection for all water samples collected at dwtps using a filter unit 37 mm 192 monitor unit 37 mm diameter 0 45 μm pore size advantec and m coliblue24 broth hach in bench scale experiment e coli was quantified within 6 h of sample collection using chromocult coliform agar merck millipore japan following the manufacturer s instructions 2 2 2 virus quantification by rt qpcr viral rna was extracted from 140 μl of concentrated samples and reverse transcribed following previously established methods asami et al 2016 the primers probes and positive controls are shown in table a1 further details of pcr shown in the supplemental information 2 2 3 evaluation of viral rna extraction and rt qpcr efficiency in order to evaluate rna extraction and rt qpcr efficiency cgmmv provided by the national institute of agrobiological sciences nias japan was added as a molecular control based on its phylogenetic and morphological similarity to the target virus pmmov although mnv has been widely introduced as a molecular control in previous studies asami et al 2016 kitajima et al 2014a it is phylogenetically and morphologically different from pmmov thus cgmmv which has higher similarity to pmmov was chosen as a more appropriate molecular control for this study briefly 1 0 μl of cgmmv was added into all concentrated water samples as wll as a control sample with 140 μl of dnase rnase free distilled water to obtain a final copy number of approximately 105 copies per sample as described previously hata et al 2013 the cgmmv rt qpcr recovery efficiency was determined by measuring the copies in each water sample and comparing it to the control using qpcr and the following equation mme c c0 100 mme molecular method rna extraction plus rt qpcr efficiency c detected cgmmv copy numbers obtained from each concentrated water sample c0 detected cgmmv copy numbers obtained from the control an mme value of 10 was used as a criterion to adopt the virus copy number in a water sample if the sample was 10 then it was subjected to a further sample purification process described below the mme values in the bench scale experiment were larger than 10 throughout the study mme values were used only to evaluate sample inhibition tendency and were not used to back calculate virus copy numbers 2 2 4 calculation of virus log10 reduction and statistical analysis the reduction of viruses indicator bacteria and turbidity during each treatment process in the bench scale experiment and in full scale dwtps were calculated as lrvs only when their copy numbers were quantified before and after treatment statistical analysis t test was performed using microsoft excel 2013 to evaluate the significant difference between log10 reductions comparing the tested parameters 2 3 bench scale experiment 2 3 1 preparation of microbes for the spike experiment one milliliter of e coli k12 ifo3301 institute for fermentation japan was inoculated into 9 ml of lysogeny broth invitrogen usa to obtain approximately 10 ml of cultured solution this culture was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min to pellet the bacteria the supernatant was removed and the pelleted bacteria were resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate buffered saline this wash process was repeated three times bacteriophage qβ atcc 23631 and ms2 atcc 15597 were obtained from the american type culture collection manassas virginia usa and were cultivated using e coli k12a λ f as a host furuse et al 1978 mnv strain s7 pp3 was provided

green monkey cells provided courtesy of dr yano tokyo metropolitan institute of public health japan nov gii strain gii 6 was provided by dr utagawa university of tokyo japan from the fecal sample of an infected patient purified by ultracentrifugation with cscl density gradient pmmov and its host nicotiana benthamiana were provided by the national agriculture and food research organization japan 2 3 2 bench scale cs experiment sixty liters of raw water rw were collected monthly from august to december 2016 at plant b on the same day of full scale dwtp sampling transferred to a laboratory at the university of tokyo japan and subjected to bench scale water treatment in the laboratory within the sampling day the cs laboratory experiment was conducted using 40 l of the collected plant b rw the following microbes were added into the rw after equilibrating to room temperature 15 25 c 10 ml of e coli ifo3301 up to 2 ml each of pmmov bacteriophage qβ ms2 aiv mnv final concentration 103 copy ml and nov gii pacl basicity 54 provided by plant b was used for the coagulation experiments the ph was adjusted to approximately 7 0 using h2so4 while mixing with a stirrer the dose rate of h2so4 and pacl 17 40 mg l followed the actual treatment condition of plant b on the same sampling day cs was conducted in accordance with the jar test condition of plant b with slight modification of the settling time because the test water volume in our study was different from the jar test in plant b briefly after coagulant addition the test water was mixed rapidly for 2 min 120 rpm and slowly for 10 min 60 rpm and then left for 15 min for floc settling supernatants were collected after settling of which 2000 ml 50 ml and 350 ml were used to quantify the virus detect e coli and analyze basic water quality respectively 2 3 3 bench scale rsf experiment the sand filtration column and treatment condition were designed in accordance with design criteria for waterworks facilities in japan standardized sand effective diameter 0 6 mm uniformity coefficient 1 5 nihon genryo japan was used as a filter media in the rsf process to obtain a 65 cm filter depth in a 8 cm diameter tubular tower with a gravel layer basement flow rate was adjusted to 120 150 m day 0 13 0 18 cm s in this experimental condition using a peristaltic pump the sand filtration column was backwashed with 60 l of tap water after each experiment to reset the media condition and was saturated with tap water after resetting the media condition the virus copy number in filtered tap water was confirmed to be below the detection limit or at a negligible level compared to the virus concentration of the sample water data not shown to evaluate the step wise reduction of microbes by cs and rsf in a similar fashion to a full scale system water from the finished cs experiment was used for the influent of the sand filtration column filtered water samples were collected after 15 l of supernatant was filtered in order to avoid the effect of the tap water being saturated in the column prior to the experiment 2 3 4 sample collection water samples were collected at each step of rw treatment after each of the following steps addition of microbes n 5 cs n 5 and rsf n 5 sample concentration steps are explained below concentrated sample volumes were 500 ml for rw and 1000 ml for both post cs and post rsf indigenous virus copy number in the rw before addition of experimental viruses was determined for every sampling occasion and was found to be negligible compared with that of the inoculated viruses data not shown 2 3 5 virus concentration method water samples were concentrated using two different primary concentration methods 1 an acid rinse alkaline elution method using an electronegative membrane filter as previously described katayama et al 2002 and 2 a slightly modified method briefly for method 1 mgcl2 was added to the water sample to obtain a final concentration of 25 mmol l and the samples were passed through an electronegative membrane ha 90 mm diameter 0 45 μm pore millipore tokyo japan magnesium ions were then removed by passing 200 ml of 0 5 mmol l h2so4 through the membrane acid rinse viruses adsorbed on the filter were eluted using 10 ml of 1 0 mmol l naoh alkaline elution the eluate was recovered in a plastic tube containing 50 μl of 0 5 mol l h2so4 and 100 μl of 100 tris edta buffer ph 8 0 for neutralization and further concentrated using a centriprep ym 50 filter unit merck millipore japan to obtain a final volume of approximately 700 μl for method 2 a slight modification for the primary virus concentration step was performed a previous study reported that it was sometimes difficult to elute viruses adsorbed on membrane filters simply through filtration with naoh ahmed et al 2015 specifically in the current study it is possible that the coagulant remaining after cs could interfere with the virus concentration especially the alkaline elution process therefore instead of adding mgcl2 ph levels of the water samples were adjusted to acid condition ph 3 5 using 0 5 mol l h2so4 in order to dissolve the aluminum coagulant and the water samples were then passed through an electronegative membrane the subsequent procedure was the same as that of the original method and resulted in a final volume of approximately 700 μl the virus copy number of each sample was determined using both primary concentration methods the highest virus copy number obtained in each of the two methods was used for subsequent analysis 2 4 full scale dwtp sampling 2 4 1 water samples tested water samples were collected monthly from december 2015 to november 2016 at plant a and from march 2016 to january 2017 at plant b both of which are located in an urban area of japan these dwtps receive river water and produce yearly averages of 7 9 105 m3 plant a and 9 4 105 m3 plant b of drinking water per day the characteristics of these dwtps as well as sampling points are shown in fig 1 chlorine was injected before cs from december to march at both dwtps polyaluminum chloride pacl was used as a coagulant at both plants at a range of 17 40 mg l a small amount of coagulant 1 mg l was re added before rsf at plant a and before secondary rsf at plant b to enhance the treatment efficiency of rsf at plant a samples were collected once a month from rw n 13 from post cs n 13 from post ozone n 13 from post bac n 13 and from post rsf n 13 to evaluate the reduction efficiency of viruses through the whole treatment process including advanced treatment processes at plant b samples were collected from rw n 11 from post cs n 11 and from post primary rsf n 11 to evaluate the virus reduction efficiency samples were collected sequentially in the order of the treatment sequence from rw to after treatments on the same day but with shorter intervals than the hydraulic retention time of each treatment 2 4 2 onsite virus concentration method large volume water samples 20 l for rw 100 l for post cs and 500 l for treated water were concentrated by the acid rinse alkaline elution method with a cartridge type electronegative filter on site as described previously hata et al 2015b and stored at 4 c for further analysis for the rw samples the 20 l water sample was collected in a gamma sterilized container and mgcl2 was added directly to obtain a final concentration of 25 mmol l for other samples water samples were mixed with mgcl2 continuously by gravity flow to obtain a final concentration of 25 mmol l and this was passed through an electronegative membrane filter asami et al 2016 viral rna was extracted from concentrated samples subjected to rt and quantified by qpcr as described in sections 2 2 2 2 4 3 large volume primary virus concentration method efficiency due to the fact that the target dwtps used pacl as a coagulant which may interfere with the electrostatic nature of the virus concentration method it was important to determine the virus concentration efficiency recovery yield for the large volume primary virus concentration method used in this study however the concentration method for dwtp samples requires hundreds of liters of water leading to difficulties performing the virus spiking experiment for direct evaluation of the recovery yield therefore a one hundredth scale laboratory experiment was conducted to evaluate the efficiency of the primary virus concentration method from march 2016 to january 2017 the same virus concentration method described in the previous section was used in this recovery experiment water samples were collected on each sampling occasion in a sterilized plastic bag and transported to the laboratory in a cooler with ice packs pmmov was added into the water samples to obtain a final copy number of approximately 106 107 copies per sample sample volumes in the recovery experiment were calculated as one hundredth of the actual dwtp sample volumes similarly electronegative membrane filter used for the recovery experiment ha 47 mm diameter 0 45 μm pore millipore japan had an approximately 100 fold reduced area 9 6 cm2 compared to the cartridge type filter used for the dwtp samples 1000 cm2 filtration area subsequent processes were completed as described previously section 2 3 5 method 1 to obtain 10 ml of the primary concentrate recovery yield y was calculated as follows y x c0 v 100 y recovery yield of the primary concentration method x recovered pmmov copy number copies c0 stock pmmov copy number added into test water copy μl v added stock pmmov volume μl finally the geometric mean of y was calculated to evaluate the recovery tendency of the primary virus concentration 2 4 4 evaluation of viral rna extraction and rt qpcr efficiency viral rna extraction and rt qpcr efficiency for the full scale plant samples were evaluated as described in section 2 2 3 when the mme value was lower than 10 the water sample was subjected to a subsequent sample purification process described below 2 4 5 sample purification and dilution to mitigate the inhibition of viral detection dilution or sample purification was applied to inhibited samples mme 10 prior to the molecular methods according to a previous study gibson et al 2012 sample dilution prior to rt qpcr can effectively mitigate inhibition in addition a purification method used to remove humic acids from nucleic acid extracts using the polymeric adsorbent supelite dax 8 was employed which was developed previously schriewer et al 2011 and modified by dr akihiko hata private communication briefly a hydrophobic resin dax 8 was purified following the method described by thurman and malcolm 1981 and stored in an equal volume of 99 5 ethanol the mixture of dax 8 ethanol was introduced to the rna extraction process as described in a previous study asami et al 2016 the mixture of dax 8 ethanol was combined at a ratio of 1 1 with 140 μl of the concentrated sample and mixed well the dax 8 sample mixture was filtered using an ultrafree centrifugal filter unit pvdf 0 45 μm pore size millipore this primary filtrate was then combined with 560 μl of lysis buffer buffer avl provided with the rna extraction kit mentioned previously in addition 560 μl of buffer avl was mixed with the dax 8 resin retained in the filter unit and incubated for 10 min at room temperature 15 25 c from which secondary filtrate was recovered in the filter unit this secondary filtrate was then combined with the primary filtrate buffer avl mixture the combined primary and secondary filtrate was subjected to rna extraction as described above the extracted rna was additionally subjected to gel filtration chromatography using illustra microspin s 300 hr columns exclusion limit 118 bp 70 kda ge healthcare to remove low molecular weight organic matter following the manufacturer s protocol a flow chart depicting the determination of the virus copy number in samples corresponding to the extent of inhibition is shown in fig 2 first the virus copy number in the sample and the mme value with and without 10 dilution prior to rt qpcr were determined step 1 when the mme value of the sample was greater than 10 the higher value for either condition with or without 10 dilution was adopted as an indigenous pmmov copy number for analysis even if the indigenous pmmov copy number was negative or below the quantification limit in cases where both mme values with and without 10 dilution were greater than 10 the higher pmmov copy number was used for analysis if both mme values were less than 10 extracted rna was subjected to 100 dilution prior to rt qpcr and judged in the same manner as step 1 step 2 if mme values remained less than 10 for 100 diluted samples these were then subjected to dax 8 treatment with and without 10 dilution prior to rna extraction and judged in the same manner as step 1 step 3 in cases where all of the mme values remained less than 10 the highest indigenous pmmov copy number obtained was used for analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 bench scale experiment the ranges of temperature ph turbidity ec and e coli in the test waters table a2 showed fluctuations in all water quality parameters during the sampling period likely due to seasonality and rainfall this experiment was conducted from summer august to winter december in japan including one sampling day immediately after a typhoon august fig 3 shows lrvs of viruses e coli and turbidity in cs and rsf respectively in the bench scale experiment data from one sampling day after the typhoon are shown in a separate bar due to the great differences observed in rw quality turbidity 100 ntu average virus lrvs by cs with the exception of the typhoon period were as follows pmmov 1 96 0 30 log10 aiv 1 83 0 27 log10 mnv 1 86 0 37 log10 nov gii 1 86 0 61 log10 qβ 1 42 0 27 log10 ms2 1 44 0 41 log10 mean standard deviation sd n 4 for each and were higher than those values from the typhoon period for all viruses average virus lrvs in rsf with the exception of the typhoon period were as follows pmmov 0 26 0 38 log10 aiv 0 62 0 49 log10 mnv 0 40 0 63 log10 nov gii 0 28 0 46 log10 qβ 0 10 0 32 log10 ms2 0 99 0 45 log10 mean sd n 4 in the august sample affected by the typhoon less removal via cs but greater removal via rsf was observed the turbidity in rw was much different from that of other samples which may have caused the change in interaction between coagulants and viruses despite the fact that coagulant dosage was adjusted based on the jar test it is possible that the reduction tendency in each treatment process was affected by the rw quality hereinafter the analysis was conducted using all data except that affected by the typhoon the removal of nov gii in cs in this study was greater than that of nov gi 1 5 log10 using alum shin and sobsey 2015 or recombinant norovirus virus like particles approximately 1 log10 using pacl alum or fecl3 shirasaki et al 2010 the range of pmmov lrvs was quite similar to those of enteric viruses tested including nov gii the lrvs for pmmov and nov gii were not significantly different for cs and rsf t test p 05 positive correlations between the pmmov and nov gii lrvs in cs and rsf were also found r 0 72 y 1 45 x 0 98 for cs r 0 86 y 1 03 x 0 02 for rsf x represents pmmov lrvs y represents nov gii lrvs the log10 reductions in aiv mnv qβ ms2 as well as nov gii in cs and rsf were more similar to that of pmmov than to that of e coli or turbidity except for qβ log10 reductions in rsf which was not determined these results suggest that pmmov may be a useful treatment process indicator of nov gii in cs and rsf processes 3 2 full scale dwtps experiment 3 2 1 indicator bacteria and physicochemical parameters at full scale dwtps the ranges of temperature ph turbidity ec e coli and total coliforms in full scale dwtps are shown in table a3 as described in section 3 1 fluctuations were observed in all water qualities during the sampling period especially in terms of concentration ranges of indicator bacteria turbidity which is adopted as a critical control parameter for cryptosporidium management for treatment processes in japan was reduced greatly in cs at both plants a and b the turbidity after rsf at plant a was less than 0 14 ntu on all sampling occasions whereas that of plant b sometimes exceeded 0 14 ntu in the latter case further treatment such as advanced treatment and secondary rsf are performed the effluent from secondary rsf is maintained below 0 14 ntu to meet the criteria 3 2 2 recovery yield of primary virus concentration for dwtp samples the recovery yields of primary virus concentration from dwtp samples one hundredth scale laboratory experiment are shown in fig 4 most recovery yields were larger than 10 showing that the method employed functioned efficiently rfs at plant a showed a remarkably low recovery yield this was suspected to be due to a high concentration of residual chlorine to assess this further post rsf samples collected at plant a in august october and november 2016 were dechlorinated with sodium thiosulfate and provided for recovery experiment the recovery yield of the dechlorinated sample was 101 7 0 28 n 3 which was much higher compared with that of the chlorinated control sample 10 0 26 0 53 n 3 because the recovery yield of cs at plant b was also less than 10 residual chlorine was likely the main cause of low recovery thus degradation of the virus by chlorination during the process of virus concentration should be considered when assessing the virus recovery yield in the laboratory because virus degradation by chlorine does not hinder virus recovery during the process of virus concentration primary virus concentrations for actual treatment plant samples were assumed to have performed well 3 2 3 viral rna extraction and rt qpcr efficiency using molecular control cgmmv in order to evaluate the efficiency of rna extraction and rt qpcr a known amount of cgmmv was added to concentrated samples as a molecular control pmmov copy number in the sample cp was determined in cases where the mme value was higher than 10 recovery of added cgmmv a total of 98 samples were subjected to rna extraction and rt qpcr with and without 10 dilution before the rt process step 1 cp values were determined in 81 samples 82 7 with either the diluted or undiluted samples showing mme values of 10 among the 81 samples cp was determined in 19 untreated samples and in 62 samples with 10 dilution table 1 the remaining 17 samples were subjected to rna extraction and rt qpcr with 100 dilution before the rt process step 2 however inhibition was mitigated in only two samples 2 17 11 8 with this treatment this result suggests that sample dilution before rt can effectively mitigate inhibition but mitigation was limited when the dilution factor was increased up to 100 the remaining 15 inhibited samples were subjected to dax 8 treatment with rna extraction followed by rt qpcr with and without 10 dilution before the rt process step 3 which was able to improve mme values to 10 for all the samples cp was determined in 5 samples with 10 dilution and 10 samples without dilution with the dax 8 treatment before rt according to our results inhibition was effectively removed by the dax 8 treatment when it was not simply mitigated via sample dilution after rna extraction which may indicate that the rna extraction step was inhibited i e rather than the rt step or the pcr in summary the evaluation of extraction rt qpcr efficiency via cgmmv molecular control demonstrated that inhibition was greatly mitigated by sample dilution before rt when inhibition was not mitigated by 10 dilution dax 8 treatment combined with the rna extraction step was sufficient to mitigate inhibition as a result inhibition was mitigated sufficiently in all samples thus enabling better quantification of target virus copy number 3 2 4 quantification of pmmov in water samples at dwtps pmmov copy number in a total of 98 samples was determined by rt qpcr positive ratio and quantified ratio are summarized in table a4 in our study when the copy number was higher than the quantification limit of one copy per well the value was regarded as quantified and when it was lower than the limit then it was regarded as positive but unquantified which was not used in the subsequent analysis all rw and post cs samples at plant a were quantified however the quantified positive ratio was largely decreased after the ozone process this finding suggests a substantial contribution of ozone in reducing virus copy number on the other hand all rw post cs and post rsf samples were quantifiable at plant b with the exception of one post cs sample pmmov copy number for each treatment process in two dwtps was summarized in fig 5 pmmov copy numbers mean sd were as follows 105 35 0 48 copies l plant a n 13 and 105 33 0 34 copies l plant b n 11 for rw samples 102 97 0 65 copies l plant a n 13 and 102 71 0 63 copies l plant b n 10 for post cs samples 100 91 0 84 copies l plant a n 5 for the post ozone sample 100 99 0 75 copies l plant a n 7 for the post bac sample and 101 23 0 42 copies l plant a n 4 and 102 32 0 84 copies l plant b n 11 for post rsf samples pmmov copy number in rw samples were stable and high enough to evaluate stepwise reduction efficiency throughout the year in both plants although the turbidity of the sand filtered water at plant a was controlled to less than 0 14 ntu on all sampling occasions pmmov was nevertheless detected in 61 5 8 13 of the filtrated samples indicating that the virus particles were not completely removed despite strict turbidity control therefore the ability to guarantee the elimination of viruses in tap water via simple regulation of turbidity of filtered water is limited in cases where rw has an extremely high virus concentration purified water is further chlorinated in japan to achieve a high level of safety against enteric viruses 3 2 5 reduction efficiency of pmmov indicator bacteria and turbidity the pmmov indicator bacteria and turbidity reduction efficiencies are shown in fig 6 whose number of samples used are shown in table a5 and their average copy numbers are shown in table a6 a previous study reported that the reduction efficiencies of pmmov in cs treatment were 0 40 0 17 log10 rainy season and 1 61 log10 dry season at a full scale dwtp in bangkok asami et al 2016 these values are much lower than those found in the current study the difference in reduction efficiency of cs can be explained by the use of different coagulant types pacl in this study and aluminum sulfate in the bangkok study as well as higher rw turbidity in bangkok according to previous studies pacl more effectively removed recombinant norovirus virus like particles and bacteriophage qβ in cs treatment than did aluminum shirasaki et al 2010 2014 moreover the treatment plants in our study used chlorine before the cs process leading to a greater virus reduction compared to the study conducted in bangkok a significant log10 reduction was observed during the ozone process for pmmov likely due to the strong potential for degradation of viral rna through oxidation a previous study reported the virus reduction efficiency of the ozone process at a full scale dwtp in spain albinana gimenez et al 2009 where the lrvs of human adenovirus and jc pyv by ozone were 3 15 and 1 95 log10 respectively although the target virus of their study was different from ours the reduction efficiency obtained in this study was in accordance with the range of the previous research the virus reduction of the ozone process can be underestimated when using a molecular detection method because it detects both intact virus and disinfected viruses when viral rna is preserved neglecting the effect of inactivation regardless of this for the case of ozone treatment virus reductions observed by rt pcr were reported similar to those detected by infectivity assay in a laboratory experiment shin and sobsey 2003 therefore the virus reduction by ozone obtained in our study could theoretically underestimate the actual amount of reduction due to disinfection but this is not always the case reduction efficiencies of bac and rsf were relatively low compared to those of cs or ozone the pmmov reduction efficiencies of rsf observed at a dwtp in bangkok asami et al 2016 were slightly higher 1 26 0 25 log10 for rainy season 0 78 log10 for dry season than those found in our study this can be explained by the fact that a greater portion of virus might be caught in small flocs which likely remained after the cs process at the dwtp in bangkok leading to a higher virus reduction during the rsf process the overall reductions of pmmov observed in our study were 3 80 0 77 log10 for plant a and 2 88 0 57 log10 for plant b most likely due to different timings of ozone treatments at the two plants since ozonation is applied to the first rsf filtrate at plant b i e after the sampling point of this study further reduction of viruses is expected comparing the reduction efficiency for pmmov with that of other indicators our results indicated that pmmov was most effectively removed by cs which is better than the reduction based on turbidity and indicator bacteria would imply in both plants a and b on the other hand it was most difficult to remove pmmov by rsf processes compared to turbidity and indicator bacteria in both plants suggesting that the behavior of the virus as a particle during treatment processes may differ from that of particle causing turbidity and indicator bacteria this highlights the importance of regulating virus removal not by observing indicator bacteria or turbidity but by observing the virus themselves 4 conclusions average pmmov log10 reduction for cs and rsf treatments were similar to other viral indicators including the reference enteric virus novgii analyzed pmmov can therefore be a useful treatment process indicator of nov gii removal in cs and rsf the indigenous pmmov copy number in river water was high enough to evaluate the stepwise reduction efficiency of drinking water treatment processes mean sd 105 05 0 48 copies l plant a n 13 and 105 03 0 34 copies l plant b n 11 rna extraction rt qpcr efficiency was evaluated using cgmmv as a process control for samples with less than 10 efficiency cgmmv quantification and thus rna extraction rt qpcr efficiency was improved by either 1 diluting the sample prior to rt or 2 dax 8 treatment during rna extraction based upon pmmov reductions cs and ozone treatments contributed the most to virus reduction at full scale dwtps with reductions of 2 38 0 74 log10 plant a n 13 and 2 63 0 76 log10 plant b n 10 for cs and 1 91 1 18 log10 plant a n 5 for ozone funding sources this research was supported by the tokyo metropolitan

19749,the discovery of denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo has not only improved our understanding of global methane and nitrogen cycles but also provided new technology options for removal of nitrate from nitrate contaminated water previous studies have demonstrated damo organisms could remove nitrate and nitrite from wastewater under strictly anaerobically conditions in the study we investigate the feasibility of nitrate removal from groundwater which contains dissolved oxygen in addition to nitrate a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr inoculated with damo co culture was capable of treating synthetic groundwater containing highly contaminated nitrate 50 mg n l and oxygen 7 9 mg o2 l with a maximum volumetric nitrate removal rate of 45 mg n l d accumulations of acetate and propionate were observed in some transient periods indicating the possible involvement of acetate and propionate as intermediates in methane oxidation the 16 s rrna gene amplicon sequencing revealed that candidatus methylomirabilis a known bacterial damo organism able to couple nitrite reduction with anaerobic oxidation of methane aom was the dominant population no archaeal damo organisms that are capable of coupling nitrate to aom were observed however considerable amount of denitrifiers were developed in this system based on known metabolisms of these microorganisms and a series of batch studies it was assumed that methane was oxidized into volatile fatty acids vfas under oxygen limiting conditions then the generated vfas served as carbon sources for these heterotrophic denitrifiers

very significant role in the supply of drinking water for example groundwater is the primary source of drinking water for 44 of the population in the united states hallam et al 2004 in some developing particularly rural regions without access to tap water it is the primary source of drinking water shen et al 2015 however the intensive use of nitrogen containing fertilizers in agriculture has resulted in the continuous release of nitrate to groundwater almasri 2007 nitrate contamination in groundwater poses a serious threat to public health potentially causing methemoglobinemia or stomach cancer luo et al 2014 wolfe and patz 2002 therefore making nitrate removal from groundwater important nitrate removal from groundwater can be achieved through physical reverse osmosis or electrodialysis chemical chemical physical ion exchange or biological methods rivett et al 2008 among them biological denitrification has been recognized as one of the most efficient processes for nitrate removal from groundwater which can take place in the aquifer in situ bioremediation or in above ground reactors in addition the biological denitrification process is more suitable for large scale applications compared to physical and chemical processes soares 2000 however external organic carbon sources e g ethanol or methanol are generally added as electron donors for heterotrophic denitrification which incurs significant cost to this process it also potentially causes secondary pollution when dosed in excess for example promoting biofilm growth in water distribution systems waki et al 2005 methane has thus been proposed to be an alternative electron donor in place of methanol or ethanol which is a much cheaper and easily available carbon source with a low solubility thus leaving no residual after usage methane supported nitrate removal has been investigated previously in a few studies mostly based on the aerobic methane oxidation coupled with denitrification under aerobic conditions costa et al 2000 eisentraeger et al 2001 thalasso et al 1997 modin et al 2008 2010 rhee and fuhs 1978 sun et al 2013 waki et al 2005 zhu et al 2016 in such systems oxygen and methane were simultaneously provided where methane oxidation coupled with denitrification was the result of cooperative action by microorganisms i e methanotrophic bacteria and denitrifying bacteria methanotrophs convert the assimilated carbon to soluble metabolite such as citrate rhee and fuhs 1978 methanol mechsner and hamer 1985 acetate costa et al 2000 which then serves as an carbon and energy sources for denitrifying bacteria to accomplish the denitrification process meanwhile the co existing methanotrophs are capable of utilizing oxygen preferentially within biofilm thus creating an anoxic micro environment for denitrifiers sun et al 2013 lately the denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo process that capable of directly using methane as carbon source for denitrification under anaerobic condition have been reported ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 this provided a new technology option for nitrate removal from groundwater or wastewater two key microorganisms have been discovered so far to facilitate the damo process ettwig et al 2010 identified a novel bacterium candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera belonging to the nc10 phylum is able to reduce nitrite with methane as the electron donor reaction 1 8no2 3ch4 8h 4n2 3co2 10h2o haroon et al 2013 discovered a novel archaeon candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens belonging to the anme 2d cluster which is able to reduce nitrate to nitrite with methane as the electron donor reaction 2 8no3 2ch4 8no2 2co2 4h2o named as damo archaea the application of damo in wastewater treatment under anaerobic condition has been documented in several lab scale studies cai et al 2015 shi et al 2013 xie et al 2016 which simultaneously remove nitrate nitrite and ammonium from wastewater however the damo process has not been studied for nitrate removal from groundwater which contains not only nitrate but also a certain level of oxygen a concentration of up to its saturation level 9 mg l in shallow groundwater datry et al 2004 schnobrich et al 2007 unless oxygen is removed through a pre treatment step the damo process could not proceed under strictly anaerobic conditions but more likely under aerobic conditions the potential impact of this oxygen contamination on the microbial community is not known and has to be evaluated the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of nitrate removal from well oxygenated groundwater by involving the damo microorganisms in a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr to achieve this a lab scale mbfr was inoculated with a co culture containing archaeal damo and bacterial damo and fed with methane delivered through the hollow fibers and synthetic groundwater containing nitrate and oxygen this mbfr design has previously been demonstrated to enable efficient removal of nitrate and ammonium from wastewater cai et al 2015 schnobrich et al 2007 shi et al 2013 xie et al 2016 to obtain biofilm growth on the hollow fibre membranes the reactor was operated under strictly anaerobic conditions for 9 months start up phase before being fed with synthetic groundwater containing nitrate and oxygen at various hydraulic retention time hrt the nitrate removal performance was continuously monitored batch tests were performed at the end of the operation to verify the reactions involved in the nitrate removal process furthermore the microbial community was also analyzed using 16 s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish the key microorganisms involved in the nitrate removal process using methane as carbon source were disclosed our results herein are expected to help the development of a process for nitrate removal from groundwater using methane based mbfr system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a laboratory scale mbfr with a working volume of 800 ml 200 mm in height and 80 mm in internal diameter was set up to remove nitrate by delivering methane as a sole carbon source through hollow fiber membranes fig s1 supporting information eight bundles of composite hollow fiber membranes 200 μm of inner diameter and 300 μm of outer diameter were fixed into the reactor each bundle consisted of 64 fibers with a length of 300 mm in total 512 fibers inside the reactor gave a membrane surface area of 0 145 m2 and accordingly a membrane surface reactor volume ratio of 181 m2 m3 table s1 each bundle of hollow fibers has an u shaped bent and the end was connected to a gas cylinder 95 ch4 and 5 co2 coregas australia the gas pressure in lumen of all hollow fibres was adjusted to 150 kpa by a gas pressure regulator ross brown australia connected to the gas cylinder an over flow bottle was connected to the reactor to release effluent the produced gases or the unutilised offgas a magnetic stirrer 500 rpm labtek australia was employed to provide mixing to the bulk medium in the mbfr system to further improve hydraulic conditions a peristaltic pump masterflex usa and tygon e lab tubing internal diameter 3 1 mm masterflex cole parmer were used to recirculate the liquid with their operation further described below the ph in the reactor was kept between 7 and 8 by manual injecting 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh solutions the reactor was run in a temperature controlled lab with the temperature maintained at 22 2 c 2 2 inoculum and synthetic influent composition the mbfr was seeded with 150 ml of inoculum taken from a parent damo anammox reactor fed with nitrate ammonium and methane haroon et al 2013 at the time of inoculation the parent reactor was operated with an average nitrate removal rate of 25 mg n l d where damo archaea damo bacteria and anammox bacteria jointly dominated the culture the composition of the synthetic influent was g l kh2po4 0 038 mgcl2 6h2o 0 008 cacl2 2h2o 0 015

table s2 in phase i in order to enrich biomass and achieve biomass attachment on the hollow fibers membranes the reactor was maintained at anaerobic condition similar to the parent reactor nitrate was provided into the reactor via manual addition of a concentrated stock nitrate solution with each addition giving an initial concentration of 40 140 mg no3 n l in phase ii the influent with a constant nitrate concentration of 50 mg n l was continuously fed to the mbfr with a peristaltic pump watson marlow the influent flow rate was increased stepwise resulting in a reducing hrt from 5 to 0 7 d in order to mimic groundwater the influent was not flushed with nitrogen gas to remove dissolved oxygen do the do concentration in influent was approximately 7 9 mg l during phase ii the recirculation system was started from day 320 which delivered an external recirculation with the flow rate of 100 ml min effluent samples were taken daily from the over flow bottle fig s1 to monitor the nitrate nitrite and ammonium concentrations in addition possible intermediates from methane oxidation under oxygen limiting conditions were regularly monitored 2 3 samples per week during the entire experimental period gas samples in the reactor headspace were taken by using a gas tight glass syringe sge australia for detecting the amount of methane in gaseous phase liquid samples were also taken to measure the amount of dissolved methane in liquid phase the ph value and the do concentration were continuously monitored with a ph meter oakton australia and a do meter hach australia respectively 2 4 batch tests for mass balance batch tests were conducted to investigate potential reactions in the mbfr to measure nitrate and methane consumptions and possible accumulation of reaction intermediates at the end of phase ii at this phase the biomass was mostly growing on the membrane surfaces and firmly attaching to them the suspended biomass in the medium was negligible to measure the methane consumption the reactor was disconnected from the gas cylinder to stop methane supply freshly prepared medium was sparged with methane gas 95 methane and 5 carbon dioxide for 30 min at a flow rate of 600 ml min which ensured that the medium was saturated with methane 21 mg l then the liquid phase of the mbfr was replaced and filled with this methane saturated liquid medium batch a was conducted for 12 h to verify if anaerobic denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation was still present in the mbfr under anaerobic condition no oxygen was provided seven gas and seven liquid samples were taken over this period to monitor methane and nitrate consumption respectively batch b was operated for 12 h in order to verify methane partial oxidation under oxygen limiting conditions limited oxygen was provided with a rate of 0 5 mg o2 l h for 12 h through an oxygen permeate tube tygon e lab tubing internal diameter 3 1 mm masterflex cole parmer the methane conversion and possible accumulation of reaction intermediates were monitored under nitrate absent and oxygen limiting conditions with seven gas and seven liquid samples collected over this period following the completion of batch b batch c was immediately conducted to verify if heterotrophic denitrification was preceded by using intermediates from methane oxidation generated from batch b at the end of batch b and before batch c pure dinitrogen gas was flushed into the reactor from 30 min to strip out the residual methane in the system confirmed by methane measurement then a nitrate stock solution was manually injected to get an initial concentration of 25 mg no3 n l and the nitrate reduction was monitored by taking seven liquid samples for analysis of nitrate and nitrite during a period of 3 h 2 5 chemical analyses the concentrations of nitrate nitrite and ammonium were measured using a lachat quickchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wi vfas were determined using a gas chromatography 7890a agilent technologies equipped by a polar capillary column db ffap and a flame ionisation detector fid with 10 v v formic acid as the internal standard the methane in gaseous phase was analysed on a gas chromatograph shimazu japan equipped with a porapak q column and a thermal conductivity detector tcd the dissolved methane in liquid phase was measured on an agilent 7890a gas chromatograph equipped with a supelco 6 feet 1 8 in stainless steel packed column hayesep q 80 100 and an fid detector 2 6 dna extraction and 16 s rrna gene sequencing in addition to the inoculum biofilm samples were also collected on day 271 and day 457 when the mbfr achieved stable nitrate removal in phases i and ii respectively according to the manufacturer s instructions genomic dna of the biomass samples was extracted using the fastdna spin for soil kit mp biomedicals usa the dna concentration was quantified by nanodrop 2000 thermo fisher scientific wilmington de usa a universal primer set 926f 5 aaactyaaakgaattgacgg 3 and 1392r 5 acgggcggtgtgtrc 3 was used to amplify the 16 s rrna gene pcr products were purified and quantified using a qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen and a quant it dsdna hs assay kit invitrogen respectively samples were submitted to australian centre for ecogenomics brisbane australia and were sequenced on an illumina miseq platform illumina usa according to the manufacturer s protocol raw sequencing data were de multiplexed with trimmomatic and chimeric sequences were trimmed and removed after the above quality control process a total number of 197 690 qualified sequences were obtained afterwards high quality sequences of 97 similarity were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus by qiime with default settings and then taxonomically aligned against greengenes 16 s rrna database desantis et al 2006 the taxonomic classification and otu representative sequences were output in an otu table 2 7 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish the inoculum anaerobic biofilm day 271 and micro aerobic biofilm day 457 were collected fixed hybridized and visualized according to the previous method ettwig et al 2008 the specific probes used for hybridization were as follows s darc 872 a a 18 5 ggctccacccgttgtagt 3 for damo archaea s nc10 1162 a a 18 5 gccttcctccagcttgacgctg 3 for damo bacteria and s amx 820 a a 18 5 aaaacccctctacttagtgccc 3 for anammox bacteria 3 results 3 1 enriching damo biofilm under anaerobic condition phase i aimed to grow damo biofilm onto the surface of the hollow fiber membranes by inoculating a suspended damo anammox culture and providing nitrate and methane to the mbfr it was found that nitrate was reduced with a removal rate fluctuating between 0 6 and 10 4 mg n l d fig 1 after 271 days of enrichment a layer of biofilm was observed on the membrane surface and the nitrate removal rate was steady at 3 1 4 4 mg n l d this nitrate removal rate was lower than that in the parent reactor with suspended culture 25 mg n l d a possible reason is the washout of anammox bacteria in the absence of ammonium see 3 3 for the microbial data the existence of anammox bacteria can rapidly utilize the nitrite produced from nitrate reduction by damo archaea it has been observed previously that the anammox reaction stimulated the activity of damo archaea through a synergistic relationship haroon et al 2013 hu et al 2015 interestingly the nitrate removal rate substantially increased during days 111 147 with a maximal rate of 10 4 mg n l d due to an accidental introduction of oxygen into the reactor the top cap of the reactor was accidently loosened for one week resulting in oxygen ingress this suggested that the introduction of oxygen might enhance the nitrate reduction ability of the enriched damo microorganisms 3 2 achieving stable nitrate removal under oxygen limiting conditions in phase ii synthetic groundwater containing 50 mg n l nitrate and 7 9 mg l do was continuously fed in the mbfr fig 2 shows variations of nitrate concentration and its removal efficiency at varied hrts under oxygen limiting conditions although oxygen was supplied through feed from day 272 and likely through the external recirculation system as well from day 320 do concentration in the mbfr was always lower than the detection limit of the do probe i e 0 01 mg l hach ldo101 probe hq30 d m suggesting a rapid consumption of oxygen consumed by the biofilm in the system with a nitrate concentration of around 50 mg n l in the feed the oxygen ingress did not incur any negative effects on the nitrate removal ability of the mbfr the nitrate fed was completely removed with an hrt of 5 d giving rise to a nitrate removal rate of 9 0 1 1 mg n l d significantly higher than the rate achieved at the end of phase i the effluent nitrate concentration gradually increased to 18 2 mg n l nitrate removal efficiency of 64 1 when the hrt was reduced to 3 d in order to improve the hydraulic condition a recirculation pump was employed to recycle the liquor in the mbfr from day 320 afterwards the influent nitrate at 50 mg n l was found to be completely removed even with an hrt 1 d however when the hrt was further reduced to 0 7 d the nitrate concentration in the effluent increased to 26 8 mg n l which made the nitrate removal efficiency drop to 46 2 when the hrt was restored to 1 d the mbfr achieved a nitrate removal efficiency of above 80 and an effluent nitrate concentration of below 10 mg n l the effluent nitrate could meet the groundwater standard 10 mg n l set by the us environmental protection agency doudrick et al 2013 there was no nitrite accumulation in the mbfr through the entire experimental period which indicated that the produced nitrite was instantaneously reduced in addition do in the mbfr remained below the detection level during the entire phase ii resulting in a quasi anaerobic condition named as oxygen limiting condition in this study there was no accumulation of vfa or methanol in the reactor when hrt was 5 d however when hrt was decreased from 5 d to 3 d vfas comprising mainly acetate 80 and propionate 10 were detected with concentrations reaching a maximum of 16 1 mg acetate c l fig 3 the accumulation of vfa at hrt of 3 d could be caused by an vfa production exceeding its consumption rate by denitrification the residual vfas in the reactor gradually declined to undetectable levels when the hrt was further reduced from 3 d to 0 7 d possibly due to its ongoing consumption by denitrification as carbon sources 3 3 possible reactions based on batch test results in order to elucidate nitrate reduction and methane partial oxidation under oxygen limiting conditions batch tests were conducted at the end of phase ii fig 4 when the oxygen supply was absent in batch a i e strictly anaerobic condition by flushing nitrogen gas through the reactor neither methane oxidation nor nitrate reduction could proceed fig 4a indicating no nitrate dependent damo process occurred in contrast methane was partially oxidized into vfas in batch b when limited oxygen 0 5 mg o2 l h for 12 h was introduced into the batch reactor indicating oxygen might be a triggering factor for methane oxidation to vfas vfas accumulated in the reactor in the absence of nitrate fig 4b once nitrate was manually dosed into the reactor in batch c the denitrification process occurred immediately nitrate was primarily reduced to nitrite 72 3 in the first 1 5 h resulting in an acetate to nitrate molar ratio of 0 68 then nitrite was further reduced giving an acetate to nitrite molar ratio of 0 70 in the following 1 5 h fig 4c 3 4 microbial community shift induced by anaerobic or oxygen limiting conditions both fish and 16 s rrna gene amplicon sequencing were conducted to characterize the microbial community structure of the inoculum day 0 anaerobic biofilm day 271 and oxygen limiting biofilm day 457 fish results show that the inoculum was predominated by m nitroreducens an archaeal damo m oxyfera a bacterial damo and anammox bacteria fig s2a without being provided with ammonium in influent the anammox population gradually disappeared in anaerobic or oxygen limiting biofilm in terms of damo populations m nitroreducens dominated over m oxyfera under anaerobic condition day 271 fig s2b while m oxyfera became the only dominating group under oxygen limiting conditions with m nitroreducens no longer detectable day 457 fig s2c the shift of microbial community structure at phylum and genus levels under anaerobic and oxygen limiting conditions are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively at phylum level fig 5a both euryarchaeota 32 9 and planctomycetes 32 7 contributed significantly to the overall microbial community of the inoculum after 271 days enrichment under anaerobic condition in phase i chloroflexi 22 8 proteobacteria 14 7 and euryarchaeota 13 9 became the three most abundant phyla in the mbfr biofilm while after 186 days operation under oxygen limiting conditions in phase ii proteobacteria 31 7 and nc10 12 5 were more abundant than other phyla the abundance of proteobacteria and nc10 increased whereas euryarchaeota and planctomycetes dropped to nearly undetectable levels after oxygen limiting operation suggesting that the introduction of oxygen caused a shift of microbial community within the biofilm at genus level fig 5b candidatus methanoperedens phycisphaerales unclassified and candidatus methylomirabilis were dominating members of the community in inoculum accounting for 70 8 of the total microbial sequences after 271 days of anaerobic enrichment the dominant genera changed to envops12 unclassified candidatus methanoperedens phycisphaerales unclassified and ignavibacteriaceae unclassified accounting for 46 6 of the total microbial sequences in the biofilm however under oxygen limiting conditions candidatus methanoperedens the archaeal damo and phycisphaerales unclassified in the inoculum completely disappeared indicating a detrimental effect of oxygen exposure on these phylotypes in contrast several new genera appeared in the biofilm including comamonas lysobacter ferruginibacter and azoarcus it is worth noting that candidatus methylomirabilis was the second most abundant genus and became the only known methane related microbe under the steady state of phase ii account for 12 5 of the total sequences from 1 3 under anaerobic condition in phase i in addition the abundance of candidatus kuenenia anammox bacteria decreased from 3 1 inoculum to undetectable levels phase ii 4 discussion 4 1 methane supported nitrate removal from groundwater in an mbfr although nitrate removal by aerobic methane oxidation has been investigated in previous laboratory studies modin et al 2007 application of damo to nitrate removal from groundwater has not been verified so far this study demonstrated that methane could support nitrate removal from groundwater in the mbfr a total nitrate removal rate of 45 mg l d was achieved in this work compared to the reported rates in the range from 24 to 260 mg n l d using the aerobic methane oxidation process modin et al 2007 sun et al 2013 nitrogen removal rate achieved in this work is at the median level the methane supported nitrate removal in this work provides lower rates than the typical denitrification rate with methanol as the carbon source typical values of 500 mg n l d metcalf and eddy 2003 or with wastewater as the carbon source typical values of 60 200 mg n l d modin et al 2007 the proposed technology could potentially be further optimized to increase nitrogen removal rate to match practical applications the supply of oxygen to the microorganisms appears to be an important factor for the denitrification rate thus the control of oxygen supply to further enhance the denitrification rate should be assessed in future studies through further optimization methane supported denitrification under oxygen limiting condition could become a promising technology for the remediation of nitrate contaminated groundwater the methane supported nitrate removal process developed in this work has advantages over several other technologies firstly in comparison with soluble organic carbon e g methanol or hydrogen methane is an inexpensive electron donor and is widely available also it can be produced from renewable sources such as wastewater modin et al 2007 based on the theoretically optimal ratio of carbon to nitrogen the cost for methane and for methanol to support denitrification is estimated to be 0 50 and 0 80 per kg no3 n removed modin et al 2007 secondly the addition of a soluble carbon source could leave residual organic matters in effluent which is detrimental for water quality in comparison methane is much less soluble and will not remain in the treated effluent eisentraeger et al 2001 furthermore in previous studies on aerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification the widely used method is to mix methane and oxygen by either sparking them into the liquid or supplying both from the membrane lumen modin et al 2008 such flammable gaseous mixture poses a safety hazard potentially hindering the application of the process sun et al 2013 this study used the mbfr system with methane provided through hollow fiber membranes but oxygen supplied into liquid separately through feeding this strategy avoids the potential safety hazard associated with the provision of two kinds of reacting gases zhu et al 2016 in addition as revealed in previous studies cai et al 2015 shi et al 2013 a major bottleneck for methane supported denitrification is associated with the low methane solubility approximately 22 7 mg l under 20 c and 101 3 kpa mackay and shiu 1981 the mbfr configuration allows a higher mass transfer rate via delivering gaseous substrates directly to microbes and prevents their loss into the effluent thus enhancing gas utilization and energy efficiency martin and nerenberg 2012 modin et al 2010 4 2 possible mechanisms for nitrate removal in the mbfr the nitrate removal in the methane based mbfr seems to be achieved via a partnership between multiple organisms based on the results of batch a neither methane oxidation nor nitrate reduction could proceed under strictly anaerobic condition suggesting that nitrate reduction was not directly coupled to methane oxidation both fish and 16 s rrna gene sequencing analyses also confirmed no damo archaea known to be able to anaerobically oxidise methane could be detected in phase ii which supports the process data conversely nitrate reduction was more likely coupled to oxidation of intermediates of methane oxidation in both batch tests b and c denitrification proceeded immediately in the presence of vfas under oxygen limiting conditions the vfa production was likely through aerobic methane oxidation although the organisms responsible for this reaction could not be identified it could be by unknown aerobic methanotrophs or by candidatus methylomirabilis damo bacteria in aerobic methanotrophs methane oxidation proceeds through methanol formaldehyde and formate to carbon dioxide trotsenko and murrell 2008 the initial step of methane oxidation to methanol is carried out by the enzyme methane mono oxygenase mmo under oxygen sufficient conditions the final step of methane oxidation is to oxidize formate into carbon dioxide recently kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 revealed a methane fermentation pathway in an aerobic methanotrophic bacterium methylomicrobium alcaliphilum strain 20z under oxygen limiting conditions leading to the formation of formate acetate succinate and lactate as end products by fermenting methane derived formaldehyde based on the current knowledge candidatus methylomirabilis can mediate methane oxidation via a classical aerobic methane oxidation pathway ettwig et al 2010 specifically candidatus methylomirabilis has a unique ability to produce intracellular o2 by the disproportionation of nitric oxide formed in nitrite reduction o2 thus generated is used for activating and oxidizing methane in the strictly o2 dependent reaction mediated by pmmo enzyme ettwig et al 2010 wu et al 2011 it is suspected that candidatus methylomirabilis might adopt the same pathway with m alcaliphilum for the vfa production which warrant further studies in the future however candidatus methylomirabilis is not able to reduce nitrate to nitrite due to the lack of nitrate reductase genes ettwig et al 2010 interestingly some bacteria with nitrate respiration capacity were detected within the biofilm e g comamonas with an abundance of 16 3 and azoarcus of 2 5 song et al 2001 xing et al 2010 these bacteria are known as heterotrophic denitrifiers which require organic carbon such as methanol or acetate to complete the nitrate reduction reaction considering methane was the only organic carbon source fed to this reactor we assumed methane was oxidized to vfas under oxygen limiting condition the vfas thus generated possibly served as electron donors for heterotrophic denitrifiers to remove nitrate 5 conclusions the results presented in this study experimentally demonstrated that a membrane biofilm reactor inoculated with damo co culture could successfully remove nitrate from the well oxygenated groundwater by using methane as the carbon source the main outcomes were a maximum volumetric nitrate removal rate of 45 mg n l d was achieved and synthetic groundwater contaminated with nitrate could be treated to discharge limits tn 10 mg l acetate and propionate as intermediates were observed in the system their maximum concentration were 16 1 mg acetate c l and 2 5 mg propionate c l the 16 s rrna gene sequencing showed that damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis and heterotrophic denitrifiers comamonas and azoarcus were dominant genera in the biofilm we assumed that under oxygen limiting conditions methane was oxidized into vfas which were electron donors for heterotrophic denitrifiers to remove nitrate acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the australian

19749,the discovery of denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo has not only improved our understanding of global methane and nitrogen cycles but also provided new technology options for removal of nitrate from nitrate contaminated water previous studies have demonstrated damo organisms could remove nitrate and nitrite from wastewater under strictly anaerobically conditions in the study we investigate the feasibility of nitrate removal from groundwater which contains dissolved oxygen in addition to nitrate a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr inoculated with damo co culture was capable of treating synthetic groundwater containing highly contaminated nitrate 50 mg n l and oxygen 7 9 mg o2 l with a maximum volumetric nitrate removal rate of 45 mg n l d accumulations of acetate and propionate were observed in some transient periods indicating the possible involvement of acetate and propionate as intermediates in methane oxidation the 16 s rrna gene amplicon sequencing revealed that candidatus methylomirabilis a known bacterial damo organism able to couple nitrite reduction with anaerobic oxidation of methane aom was the dominant population no archaeal damo organisms that are capable of coupling nitrate to aom were observed however considerable amount of denitrifiers were developed in this system based on known metabolisms of these microorganisms and a series of batch studies it was assumed that methane was oxidized into volatile fatty acids vfas under oxygen limiting conditions then the generated vfas served as carbon sources for these heterotrophic denitrifiers to remove nitrate this study offers a potential technology for nitrate removal from groundwater by damo process in mbfr graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane biofilm reactor nitrate removal

very significant role in the supply of drinking water for example groundwater is the primary source of drinking water for 44 of the population in the united states hallam et al 2004 in some developing particularly rural regions without access to tap water it is the primary source of drinking water shen et al 2015 however the intensive use of nitrogen containing fertilizers in agriculture has resulted in the continuous release of nitrate to groundwater almasri 2007 nitrate contamination in groundwater poses a serious threat to public health potentially causing methemoglobinemia or stomach cancer luo et al 2014 wolfe and patz 2002 therefore making nitrate removal from groundwater important nitrate removal from groundwater can be achieved through physical reverse osmosis or electrodialysis chemical chemical physical ion exchange or biological methods rivett et al 2008 among them biological denitrification has been recognized as one of the most efficient processes for nitrate removal from groundwater which can take place in the aquifer in situ bioremediation or in above ground reactors in addition the biological denitrification process is more suitable for large scale applications compared to physical and chemical processes soares 2000 however external organic carbon sources e g ethanol or methanol are generally added as electron donors for heterotrophic denitrification which incurs significant cost to this process it also potentially causes secondary pollution when dosed in excess for example promoting biofilm growth in water distribution systems waki et al 2005 methane has thus been proposed to be an alternative electron donor in place of methanol or ethanol which is a much cheaper and easily available carbon source with a low solubility thus leaving no residual after usage methane supported nitrate removal has been investigated previously in a few studies mostly based on the aerobic methane oxidation coupled with denitrification under aerobic conditions costa et al 2000 eisentraeger et al 2001 thalasso et al 1997 modin et al 2008 2010 rhee and fuhs 1978 sun et al 2013 waki et al 2005 zhu et al 2016 in such systems oxygen and methane were simultaneously provided where methane oxidation coupled with denitrification was the result of cooperative action by microorganisms i e methanotrophic bacteria and denitrifying bacteria methanotrophs convert the assimilated carbon to soluble metabolite such as citrate rhee and fuhs 1978 methanol mechsner and hamer 1985 acetate costa et al 2000 which then serves as an carbon and energy sources for denitrifying bacteria to accomplish the denitrification process meanwhile the co existing methanotrophs are capable of utilizing oxygen preferentially within biofilm thus creating an anoxic micro environment for denitrifiers sun et al 2013 lately the denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo process that capable of directly using methane as carbon source for denitrification under anaerobic condition have been reported ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 this provided a new technology option for nitrate removal from groundwater or wastewater two key microorganisms have been discovered so far to facilitate the damo process ettwig et al 2010 identified a novel bacterium candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera belonging to the nc10 phylum is able to reduce nitrite with methane as the electron donor reaction 1 8no2 3ch4 8h 4n2 3co2 10h2o haroon et al 2013 discovered a novel archaeon candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens belonging to the anme 2d cluster which is able to reduce nitrate to nitrite with methane as the electron donor reaction 2 8no3 2ch4 8no2 2co2 4h2o named as damo archaea the application of damo in wastewater treatment under anaerobic condition has been documented in several lab scale studies cai et al 2015 shi et al 2013 xie et al 2016 which simultaneously remove nitrate nitrite and ammonium from wastewater however the damo process has not been studied for nitrate removal from groundwater which contains not only nitrate but also a certain level of oxygen a concentration of up to its saturation level 9 mg l in shallow groundwater datry et al 2004 schnobrich et al 2007 unless oxygen is removed through a pre treatment step the damo process could not proceed under strictly anaerobic conditions but more likely under aerobic conditions the potential impact of this oxygen contamination on the microbial community is not known and has to be evaluated the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of nitrate removal from well oxygenated groundwater by involving the damo microorganisms in a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr to achieve this a lab scale mbfr was inoculated with a co culture containing archaeal damo and bacterial damo and fed with methane delivered through the hollow fibers and synthetic groundwater containing nitrate and oxygen this mbfr design has previously been demonstrated to enable efficient removal of nitrate and ammonium from wastewater cai et al 2015 schnobrich et al 2007 shi et al 2013 xie et al 2016 to obtain biofilm growth on the hollow fibre membranes the reactor was operated under strictly anaerobic conditions for 9 months start up phase before being fed with synthetic groundwater containing nitrate and oxygen at various hydraulic retention time hrt the nitrate removal performance was continuously monitored batch tests were performed at the end of the operation to verify the reactions involved in the nitrate removal process furthermore the microbial community was also analyzed using 16 s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization fish the key microorganisms involved in the nitrate removal process using methane as carbon source were disclosed our results herein are expected to help the development of a process for nitrate removal from groundwater using methane based mbfr system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup a laboratory scale mbfr with a working volume of 800 ml 200 mm in height and 80 mm in internal diameter was set up to remove nitrate by delivering methane as a sole carbon source through hollow fiber membranes fig s1 supporting information eight bundles of composite hollow fiber membranes 200 μm of inner diameter and 300 μm of outer diameter were fixed into the reactor each bundle consisted of 64 fibers with a length of 300 mm in total 512 fibers inside the reactor gave a membrane surface area of 0 145 m2 and accordingly a membrane surface reactor volume ratio of 181 m2 m3 table s1 each bundle of hollow fibers has an u shaped bent and the end was connected to a gas cylinder 95 ch4 and 5 co2 coregas australia the gas pressure in lumen of all hollow fibres was adjusted to 150 kpa by a gas pressure regulator ross brown australia connected to the gas cylinder an over flow bottle was connected to the reactor to release effluent the produced gases or the unutilised offgas a magnetic stirrer 500 rpm labtek australia was employed to provide mixing to the bulk medium in the mbfr system to further improve hydraulic conditions a peristaltic pump masterflex usa and tygon e lab tubing internal diameter 3 1 mm masterflex cole parmer were used to recirculate the liquid with their operation further described below the ph in the reactor was kept between 7 and 8 by manual injecting 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh solutions the reactor was run in a temperature controlled lab with the temperature maintained at 22 2 c 2 2 inoculum and synthetic influent composition the mbfr was seeded with 150 ml of inoculum taken from a parent damo anammox reactor fed with nitrate ammonium and methane haroon et al 2013 at the time of inoculation the parent reactor was operated with an average nitrate removal rate of 25 mg n l d where damo archaea damo bacteria and anammox bacteria jointly dominated the culture the composition of the synthetic influent was g l kh2po4 0 038 mgcl2 6h2o 0 008 cacl2 2h2o 0 015

table s2 in phase i in order to enrich biomass and achieve biomass attachment on the hollow fibers membranes the reactor was maintained at anaerobic condition similar to the parent reactor nitrate was provided into the reactor via manual addition of a concentrated stock nitrate solution with each addition giving an initial concentration of 40 140 mg no3 n l in phase ii the influent with a constant nitrate concentration of 50 mg n l was continuously fed to the mbfr with a peristaltic pump watson marlow the influent flow rate was increased stepwise resulting in a reducing hrt from 5 to 0 7 d in order to mimic groundwater the influent was not flushed with nitrogen gas to remove dissolved oxygen do the do concentration in influent was approximately 7 9 mg l during phase ii the recirculation system was started from day 320 which delivered an external recirculation with the flow rate of 100 ml min effluent samples were taken daily from the over flow bottle fig s1 to monitor the nitrate nitrite and ammonium concentrations in addition possible intermediates from methane oxidation under oxygen limiting conditions were regularly monitored 2 3 samples per week during the entire experimental period gas samples in the reactor headspace were taken by using a gas tight glass syringe sge australia for detecting the amount of methane in gaseous phase liquid samples were also taken to measure the amount of dissolved methane in liquid phase the ph value and the do concentration were continuously monitored with a ph meter oakton australia and a do meter hach australia respectively 2 4 batch tests for mass balance batch tests were conducted to investigate potential reactions in the mbfr to measure nitrate and methane consumptions and possible accumulation of reaction intermediates at the end of phase ii at this phase the biomass was mostly growing on the membrane surfaces and firmly attaching to them the suspended biomass in the medium was negligible to measure the methane consumption the reactor was disconnected from the gas cylinder to stop methane supply freshly prepared medium was sparged with methane gas 95 methane and 5 carbon dioxide for 30 min at a flow rate of 600 ml min which ensured that the medium was saturated with methane 21 mg l then the liquid phase of the mbfr was replaced and filled with this methane saturated liquid medium batch a was conducted for 12 h to verify if anaerobic denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation was still present in the mbfr under anaerobic condition no oxygen was provided seven gas and seven liquid samples were taken over this period to monitor methane and nitrate consumption respectively batch b was operated for 12 h in order to verify methane partial oxidation under oxygen limiting conditions limited oxygen was provided with a rate of 0 5 mg o2 l h for 12 h through an oxygen permeate tube tygon e lab tubing internal diameter 3 1 mm masterflex cole parmer the methane conversion and possible accumulation of reaction intermediates were monitored under nitrate absent and oxygen limiting conditions with seven gas and seven liquid samples collected over this period following the completion of batch b batch c was immediately conducted to verify if heterotrophic denitrification was preceded by using intermediates from methane oxidation generated from batch b at the end of batch b and before batch c pure dinitrogen gas was flushed into the reactor from 30 min to strip out the residual methane in the system confirmed by methane measurement then a nitrate stock solution was manually injected to get an initial concentration of 25 mg no3 n l and the nitrate reduction was monitored by taking seven liquid samples for analysis of nitrate and nitrite during a period of 3 h 2 5 chemical analyses the concentrations of nitrate nitrite and ammonium were measured using a lachat quickchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wi vfas were determined using a gas chromatography 7890a agilent technologies equipped by a polar capillary column db ffap and a flame ionisation detector fid with 10 v v formic acid as the internal standard the methane in gaseous phase was analysed on a gas chromatograph shimazu japan equipped with a porapak q column and a thermal conductivity detector tcd the dissolved methane in liquid phase was measured on an agilent 7890a gas chromatograph equipped with a supelco 6 feet 1 8 in stainless steel packed column hayesep q 80 100 and an fid detector 2 6 dna extraction and 16 s rrna gene sequencing in addition to the inoculum biofilm samples were also collected on day 271 and day 457 when the mbfr achieved stable nitrate removal in phases i and ii respectively according to the manufacturer s instructions genomic dna of the biomass samples was extracted using the fastdna spin for soil kit mp biomedicals usa the dna concentration was quantified by nanodrop 2000 thermo fisher scientific wilmington de usa a universal primer set 926f 5 aaactyaaakgaattgacgg 3 and 1392r 5 acgggcggtgtgtrc 3 was used to amplify the 16 s rrna gene pcr products were purified and quantified using a qiaquick pcr purification kit qiagen and a quant it dsdna hs assay kit invitrogen respectively samples were submitted to australian centre for ecogenomics brisbane australia and were sequenced on an illumina miseq platform illumina usa according to the manufacturer s protocol raw sequencing data were de multiplexed with trimmomatic and chimeric sequences were trimmed and removed after the above quality control process a total number of 197 690 qualified sequences were obtained afterwards high quality sequences of 97 similarity were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus by qiime with default settings and then taxonomically aligned against greengenes 16 s rrna database desantis et al 2006 the taxonomic classification and otu representative sequences were output in an otu table 2 7 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish the inoculum anaerobic biofilm day 271 and micro aerobic biofilm day 457 were collected fixed hybridized and visualized according to the previous method ettwig et al 2008 the specific probes used for hybridization were as follows s darc 872 a a 18 5 ggctccacccgttgtagt 3 for damo archaea s nc10 1162 a a 18 5 gccttcctccagcttgacgctg 3 for damo bacteria and s amx 820 a a 18 5 aaaacccctctacttagtgccc 3 for anammox bacteria 3 results 3 1 enriching damo biofilm under anaerobic condition phase i aimed to grow damo biofilm onto the surface of the hollow fiber membranes by inoculating a suspended damo anammox culture and providing nitrate and methane to the mbfr it was found that nitrate was reduced with a removal rate fluctuating between 0 6 and 10 4 mg n l d fig 1 after 271 days of enrichment a layer of biofilm was observed on the membrane surface and the nitrate removal rate was steady at 3 1 4 4 mg n l d this nitrate removal rate was lower than that in the parent reactor with suspended culture 25 mg n l d a possible reason is the washout of anammox bacteria in the absence of ammonium see 3 3 for the microbial data the existence of anammox bacteria can rapidly utilize the nitrite produced from nitrate reduction by damo archaea it has been observed previously that the anammox reaction stimulated the activity of damo archaea through a synergistic relationship haroon et al 2013 hu et al 2015 interestingly the nitrate removal rate substantially increased during days 111 147 with a maximal rate of 10 4 mg n l d due to an accidental introduction of oxygen into the reactor the top cap of the reactor was accidently loosened for one week resulting in oxygen ingress this suggested that the introduction of oxygen might enhance the nitrate reduction ability of the enriched damo microorganisms 3 2 achieving stable nitrate removal under oxygen limiting conditions in phase ii synthetic groundwater containing 50 mg n l nitrate and 7 9 mg l do was continuously fed in the mbfr fig 2 shows variations of nitrate concentration and its removal efficiency at varied hrts under oxygen limiting conditions although oxygen was supplied through feed from day 272 and likely through the external recirculation system as well from day 320 do concentration in the mbfr was always lower than the detection limit of the do probe i e 0 01 mg l hach ldo101 probe hq30 d m suggesting a rapid consumption of oxygen consumed by the biofilm in the system with a nitrate concentration of around 50 mg n l in the feed the oxygen ingress did not incur any negative effects on the nitrate removal ability of the mbfr the nitrate fed was completely removed with an hrt of 5 d giving rise to a nitrate removal rate of 9 0 1 1 mg n l d significantly higher than the rate achieved at the end of phase i the effluent nitrate concentration gradually increased to 18 2 mg n l nitrate removal efficiency of 64 1 when the hrt was reduced to 3 d in order to improve the hydraulic condition a recirculation pump was employed to recycle the liquor in the mbfr from day 320 afterwards the influent nitrate at 50 mg n l was found to be completely removed even with an hrt 1 d however when the hrt was further reduced to 0 7 d the nitrate concentration in the effluent increased to 26 8 mg n l which made the nitrate removal efficiency drop to 46 2 when the hrt was restored to 1 d the mbfr achieved a nitrate removal efficiency of above 80 and an effluent nitrate concentration of below 10 mg n l the effluent nitrate could meet the groundwater standard 10 mg n l set by the us environmental protection agency doudrick et al 2013 there was no nitrite accumulation in the mbfr through the entire experimental period which indicated that the produced nitrite was instantaneously reduced in addition do in the mbfr remained below the detection level during the entire phase ii resulting in a quasi anaerobic condition named as oxygen limiting condition in this study there was no accumulation of vfa or methanol in the reactor when hrt was 5 d however when hrt was decreased from 5 d to 3 d vfas comprising mainly acetate 80 and propionate 10 were detected with concentrations reaching a maximum of 16 1 mg acetate c l fig 3 the accumulation of vfa at hrt of 3 d could be caused by an vfa production exceeding its consumption rate by denitrification the residual vfas in the reactor gradually declined to undetectable levels when the hrt was further reduced from 3 d to 0 7 d possibly due to its ongoing consumption by denitrification as carbon sources 3 3 possible reactions based on batch test results in order to elucidate nitrate reduction and methane partial oxidation under oxygen limiting conditions batch tests were conducted at the end of phase ii fig 4 when the oxygen supply was absent in batch a i e strictly anaerobic condition by flushing nitrogen gas through the reactor neither methane oxidation nor nitrate reduction could proceed fig 4a indicating no nitrate dependent damo process occurred in contrast methane was partially oxidized into vfas in batch b when limited oxygen 0 5 mg o2 l h for 12 h was introduced into the batch reactor indicating oxygen might be a triggering factor for methane oxidation to vfas vfas accumulated in the reactor in the absence of nitrate fig 4b once nitrate was manually dosed into the reactor in batch c the denitrification process occurred immediately nitrate was primarily reduced to nitrite 72 3 in the first 1 5 h resulting in an acetate to nitrate molar ratio of 0 68 then nitrite was further reduced giving an acetate to nitrite molar ratio of 0 70 in the following 1 5 h fig 4c 3 4 microbial community shift induced by anaerobic or oxygen limiting conditions both fish and 16 s rrna gene amplicon sequencing were conducted to characterize the microbial community structure of the inoculum day 0 anaerobic biofilm day 271 and oxygen limiting biofilm day 457 fish results show that the inoculum was predominated by m nitroreducens an archaeal damo m oxyfera a bacterial damo and anammox bacteria fig s2a without being provided with ammonium in influent the anammox population gradually disappeared in anaerobic or oxygen limiting biofilm in terms of damo populations m nitroreducens dominated over m oxyfera under anaerobic condition day 271 fig s2b while m oxyfera became the only dominating group under oxygen limiting conditions with m nitroreducens no longer detectable day 457 fig s2c the shift of microbial community structure at phylum and genus levels under anaerobic and oxygen limiting conditions are shown in fig 5 a and b respectively at phylum level fig 5a both euryarchaeota 32 9 and planctomycetes 32 7 contributed significantly to the overall microbial community of the inoculum after 271 days enrichment under anaerobic condition in phase i chloroflexi 22 8 proteobacteria 14 7 and euryarchaeota 13 9 became the three most abundant phyla in the mbfr biofilm while after 186 days operation under oxygen limiting conditions in phase ii proteobacteria 31 7 and nc10 12 5 were more abundant than other phyla the abundance of proteobacteria and nc10 increased whereas euryarchaeota and planctomycetes dropped to nearly undetectable levels after oxygen limiting operation suggesting that the introduction of oxygen caused a shift of microbial community within the biofilm at genus level fig 5b candidatus methanoperedens phycisphaerales unclassified and candidatus methylomirabilis were dominating members of the community in inoculum accounting for 70 8 of the total microbial sequences after 271 days of anaerobic enrichment the dominant genera changed to envops12 unclassified candidatus methanoperedens phycisphaerales unclassified and ignavibacteriaceae unclassified accounting for 46 6 of the total microbial sequences in the biofilm however under oxygen limiting conditions candidatus methanoperedens the archaeal damo and phycisphaerales unclassified in the inoculum completely disappeared indicating a detrimental effect of oxygen exposure on these phylotypes in contrast several new genera appeared in the biofilm including comamonas lysobacter ferruginibacter and azoarcus it is worth noting that candidatus methylomirabilis was the second most abundant genus and became the only known methane related microbe under the steady state of phase ii account for 12 5 of the total sequences from 1 3 under anaerobic condition in phase i in addition the abundance of candidatus kuenenia anammox bacteria decreased from 3 1 inoculum to undetectable levels phase ii 4 discussion 4 1 methane supported nitrate removal from groundwater in an mbfr although nitrate removal by aerobic methane oxidation has been investigated in previous laboratory studies modin et al 2007 application of damo to nitrate removal from groundwater has not been verified so far this study demonstrated that methane could support nitrate removal from groundwater in the mbfr a total nitrate removal rate of 45 mg l d was achieved in this work compared to the reported rates in the range from 24 to 260 mg n l d using the aerobic methane oxidation process modin et al 2007 sun et al 2013 nitrogen removal rate achieved in this work is at the median level the methane supported nitrate removal in this work provides lower rates than the typical denitrification rate with methanol as the carbon source typical values of 500 mg n l d metcalf and eddy 2003 or with wastewater as the carbon source typical values of 60 200 mg n l d modin et al 2007 the proposed technology could potentially be further optimized to increase nitrogen removal rate to match practical applications the supply of oxygen to the microorganisms appears to be an important factor for the denitrification rate thus the control of oxygen supply to further enhance the denitrification rate should be assessed in future studies through further optimization methane supported denitrification under oxygen limiting condition could become a promising technology for the remediation of nitrate contaminated groundwater the methane supported nitrate removal process developed in this work has advantages over several other technologies firstly in comparison with soluble organic carbon e g methanol or hydrogen methane is an inexpensive electron donor and is widely available also it can be produced from renewable sources such as wastewater modin et al 2007 based on the theoretically optimal ratio of carbon to nitrogen the cost for methane and for methanol to support denitrification is estimated to be 0 50 and 0 80 per kg no3 n removed modin et al 2007 secondly the addition of a soluble carbon source could leave residual organic matters in effluent which is detrimental for water quality in comparison methane is much less soluble and will not remain in the treated effluent eisentraeger et al 2001 furthermore in previous studies on aerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification the widely used method is to mix methane and oxygen by either sparking them into the liquid or supplying both from the membrane lumen modin et al 2008 such flammable gaseous mixture poses a safety hazard potentially hindering the application of the process sun et al 2013 this study used the mbfr system with methane provided through hollow fiber membranes but oxygen supplied into liquid separately through feeding this strategy avoids the potential safety hazard associated with the provision of two kinds of reacting gases zhu et al 2016 in addition as revealed in previous studies cai et al 2015 shi et al 2013 a major bottleneck for methane supported denitrification is associated with the low methane solubility approximately 22 7 mg l under 20 c and 101 3 kpa mackay and shiu 1981 the mbfr configuration allows a higher mass transfer rate via delivering gaseous substrates directly to microbes and prevents their loss into the effluent thus enhancing gas utilization and energy efficiency martin and nerenberg 2012 modin et al 2010 4 2 possible mechanisms for nitrate removal in the mbfr the nitrate removal in the methane based mbfr seems to be achieved via a partnership between multiple organisms based on the results of batch a neither methane oxidation nor nitrate reduction could proceed under strictly anaerobic condition suggesting that nitrate reduction was not directly coupled to methane oxidation both fish and 16 s rrna gene sequencing analyses also confirmed no damo archaea known to be able to anaerobically oxidise methane could be detected in phase ii which supports the process data conversely nitrate reduction was more likely coupled to oxidation of intermediates of methane oxidation in both batch tests b and c denitrification proceeded immediately in the presence of vfas under oxygen limiting conditions the vfa production was likely through aerobic methane oxidation although the organisms responsible for this reaction could not be identified it could be by unknown aerobic methanotrophs or by candidatus methylomirabilis damo bacteria in aerobic methanotrophs methane oxidation proceeds through methanol formaldehyde and formate to carbon dioxide trotsenko and murrell 2008 the initial step of methane oxidation to methanol is carried out by the enzyme methane mono oxygenase mmo under oxygen sufficient conditions the final step of methane oxidation is to oxidize formate into carbon dioxide recently kalyuzhnaya et al 2013 revealed a methane fermentation pathway in an aerobic methanotrophic bacterium methylomicrobium alcaliphilum strain 20z under oxygen limiting conditions leading to the formation of formate acetate succinate and lactate as end products by fermenting methane derived formaldehyde based on the current knowledge candidatus methylomirabilis can mediate methane oxidation via a classical aerobic methane oxidation pathway ettwig et al 2010 specifically candidatus methylomirabilis has a unique ability to produce intracellular o2 by the disproportionation of nitric oxide formed in nitrite reduction o2 thus generated is used for activating and oxidizing methane in the strictly o2 dependent reaction mediated by pmmo enzyme ettwig et al 2010 wu et al 2011 it is suspected that candidatus methylomirabilis might adopt the same pathway with m alcaliphilum for the vfa production which warrant further studies in the future however candidatus methylomirabilis is not able to reduce nitrate to nitrite due to the lack of nitrate reductase genes ettwig et al 2010 interestingly some bacteria with nitrate respiration capacity were detected within the biofilm e g comamonas with an abundance of 16 3 and azoarcus of 2 5 song et al 2001 xing et al 2010 these bacteria are known as heterotrophic denitrifiers which require organic carbon such as methanol or acetate to complete the nitrate reduction reaction considering methane was the only organic carbon source fed to this reactor we assumed methane was oxidized to vfas under oxygen limiting condition the vfas thus generated possibly served as electron donors for heterotrophic denitrifiers to remove nitrate 5 conclusions the results presented in this study experimentally demonstrated that a membrane biofilm reactor inoculated with damo co culture could successfully remove nitrate from the well oxygenated groundwater by using methane as the carbon source the main outcomes were a maximum volumetric nitrate removal rate of 45 mg n l d was achieved and synthetic groundwater contaminated with nitrate could be treated to discharge limits tn 10 mg l acetate and propionate as intermediates were observed in the system their maximum concentration were 16 1 mg acetate c l and 2 5 mg propionate c l the 16 s rrna gene sequencing showed that damo bacteria candidatus methylomirabilis and heterotrophic denitrifiers comamonas and azoarcus were dominant genera in the biofilm we assumed that under oxygen limiting conditions methane was oxidized into vfas which were electron donors for heterotrophic denitrifiers to remove nitrate acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the australian
