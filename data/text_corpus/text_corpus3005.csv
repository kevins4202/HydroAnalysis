15025,interactions between cations and extracellular polymeric substances eps play an important role in the formation of microbial aggregates and have key effects on the physical properties of activated sludge across wastewater and sludge treatment process here a molecular model of eps cluster in activated sludge was constructed and simulated by molecular dynamics md to probe the structural properties of eps and the interaction between eps and prevalent multivalent cations ca2 mg2 al3 then the predicted changes in physical properties were validated against the dynamic light scattering xad resin fractionation and rheology test the binding dynamics and interactions mechanisms between multivalent cations and eps functional groups were further investigated using md in combination with spectroscopic analysis results suggest that biopolymers are originally aggregated by electrostatic and intermolecular interactions forming dynamic clusters with negatively charged surface functional groups which induced electrostatic repulsion preventing further agglomeration of biopolymer clusters in the presence of multivalent cations surface polar functional groups in biopolymers are connected causing the rearrangement of eps molecular conformation that forms larger and denser agglomerates reduced solvent accessible surface area enhanced hydrophobicity and increased binding free energy lead to a strong gel like network of eps ca2 and al3 predominantly interact with functional groups in polysaccharides promoting agglomeration of macromolecules in contrast mg2 and al3 disrupted the secondary structure of proteins exposing hydrophobic interaction sites al3 can better agglomerate biopolymers with its higher positive charge and shorter coordination distance as compared to ca2 and mg2 but compromised by the effect of hydration this work offers a novel approach to explore the construction and molecular aggregation of eps enriching the theoretical basis for optimization of wastewater and sludge treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords extracellular polymeric substances molecular dynamics simulations eps cluster model multivalent cations physical properties simulation and experiment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction biological wastewater treatment is most prevalent technology in wastewater treatment plants due to its high treatment efficiency stable process performance and low economic costs wu et al 2020 liu et al 2019 the microorganisms are mostly present in the form of microbial aggregates in biological wastewater treatment systems such as active sludge as flocs biofilms and granules sheng et al 2010 extracellular polymeric substances eps represent the main component of microbial aggregates whose content and composition have substantial effects on the structure surface charge floc stability and settling properties of microbial aggregates tan et al 2015 yuan et al 2014 eps are generally in the form of gel like structure covering the surface of microbial cells and providing mechanical stability and scaffolds that allow cells to establish synergistic aggregates with enhanced water retention and nutrient sorption flemming and wingender 2010 the physical properties surface polarities flocculation ability and shear stability of eps can affect the effluent quality of treatment systems and the efficiency of resource recovery quijano et al 2017 nguyen et al 2019 the shear stability of eps determines the strength of microbial aggregates and sludge particles while the surface polarity and flocculation capacity of eps determine the rate and efficiency of solid liquid separation in sludge dewatering jia et al 2017 alam et al 2016 the interactions between eps and multivalent cations have important effects on formation and structural features of microbial aggregates the multivalent cations mg2 and ca2 are the most abundant cations in nature waters which has been proved to help in aggregation and granulation of the matrix of biopolymers and microorganisms cunha et al 2018 sajjad and kim 2015 chemical conditioning based on eps cations interactions is the most commonly used technique for deep dewatering because of its low cost and simple operation aluminum salts are one of the most commonly used conditioners cao et al 2021 niu et al 2013 thus elucidating the role of eps in flocculation by these prevalent multivalent cations is essential for biological wastewater treatment yu 2020 theoretical mechanisms have been developed to elucidate the role of eps in flocculation by multivalent cations protonation of functional groups was found to affect the flocculation and colloid properties of eps through hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions wang et al 2012 the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory is used to interpret van der waals and double layer forces during microorganisms and cation flocculation liu et al 2010 ying et al 2010 however the lack of knowledge on molecular arrangements and occurrence states of eps limited the investigation on molecular mechanisms of eps aggregation behavior in the presence of multivalent cations seviour et al 2019 such knowledge gaps lead to a great challenge in optimizing biological wastewater and sludge treatment process md simulation is a powerful tool for studying atomic scale phenomena in chemical biological and environmental sciences which is capable of following and describing the interactions between organic components with high fidelity in recent simulation studies various models have been constructed to study humic acid and natural organic matter nom and the importance of metal ions h bonds and water molecule bridges in nom devarajan et al 2020 aquino et al 2011 petrov et al 2017 constructing eps models can simulate agglomeration behavior and identify key components dominating biopolymer interactions molecular modeling approaches such as interacting particle reaction dynamics were attempted to describe the molecular structure and behaviors of eps xu et al 2021 nevertheless the development of molecular models for all atom simulations of eps has not been reported the objectives of this study are to construct a molecular model of eps aggregate in activated sludge simulate by large scale md simulations and probe the three dimensional molecular structure and interaction mechanisms between eps and multivalent cations the aggregation behavior hydrophilicity hydrophobicity and rheological property of eps are to be characterized experimentally using dynamic light scattering dls xad resin fractionation and rheological test respectively in addition the two dimensional fourier transform infrared correlation spectrum 2d ftir cos and circular dichromatic cd spectra were applied to elucidate binding sensitivity of the eps predominant groups and verify the predicted molecular mechanisms during the multivalent cation eps interaction process 2 materials and methods 2 1 eps extraction eps was separated from fresh activated sludge collected from a wastewater treatment plant located in nanjing city china the basic properties of as were provided in supporting information si table s1 eps was extracted using the cation exchange resin cer technique frølund et al 1996 the detailed procedures of eps extraction are described in previous study peng et al 2021 with purified samples stored at 4 c before analysis the organic content of eps was shown in table s2 2 2 eps model construction and md

molecules the selected biopolymers in the eps model were referred to the composition of biopolymers in extracted eps and the structure properties of biopolymers proved in previous studies the methylmalonyl coa epimerase is a key enzyme in breakdown of odd numbered fatty acid during wastewater treatment process mccarthy et al 2001 which was chosen as the representative macromolecular protein main chain the polypeptide models structures were referred to the peptides in the aquatic dom proposed by devarajan devarajan et al 2020 the structure of polysaccharide models were established based on the granulan eps identified by seviour et al 2012 and alginate like exopolysaccharides proposed by lin et al 2010 alanine ala and threonine thr were selected as representative hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid models as they are the dominant amino acids in sludge organic matters li et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 guluronic acid was chosen as the monosaccharide model molecule detailed information of biopolymer component units in the eps model was given in text s2 and table s3 all the simulations were performed using gromacs 2020 6 program in tip3p h2o model with the charmm36 force field jorgensen et al 1983 mackerell et al 1998 the models were simulated for a total of 200 ns with additional details on the computation and analysis of trajectories given in test s3 4 2 3 interaction between eps and multivalent cations multivalent cation solutions were prepared by dissolving cacl2 mgcl2 and alcl3 of analytical grade sinopharm chemical reagents co ltd in china in ultrapure water and filtered through 0 22 μm membranes to fit the requirements of organic matter concentration in different tests eps were dilute by ultrapure water to target concentrations determined by dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations binding experiments were carried out by adding 50 ml of multivalent cations solution to a series of brown sealed vials containing 50 ml of eps solution the molar ratio dosage of multivalent cations was dependent on the doc of eps the tested range of multivalent cation concentration was 0 5 mmol g eps with increments of 1 mmol g eps in the physical properties test and 0 5 mmol g eps in the spectroscopy tests the initial ph was adjusted to 7 using 0 2 mol l hcl and 0 2 mol l naoh mixed samples were shaken immediately at 200 rpm for 12 h under 25 c to ensure complexation equilibrium 2 4 characterization of eps properties the polarity of eps was evaluated by the component content fractionated using amberlite xad 4 xad 8 resins the hydrophobicity of eps was analyzed by the binding ability with hydrophobic chromophore bromophenol blue bpb details for fractionation methods and bpb bind ability measurement were provided in text s5 the floc strength of biopolymer micelles in eps was evaluated by rheological test hershel bulkley h b pseudoplastic and newton models were used to fit the eps flow curve respectively the details about rheological testing procedure and data simulation were provided in text s6 the hydrodynamic diameters dh of biopolymer micelles in eps were measured by dls analysis via a malvern zetasizer nano zs malvern uk a monochromatic coherent he ne laser with a fixed wavelength of 633 nm was used as a light source the signal of scattered light intensity was detected at 90 the signal was then calculated to obtain intensity mean size z average diameter and distribution of particle sizes the physical properties of each sample were measured at least 3 times and data were presented as mean standard deviation 2 5 spectroscopic analysis of interaction between eps and multivalent cations uv vis absorption spectra was measured using a uv 1900 spectrometer shimadzu duisburg japan over a wavelength range of 190 600 nm with 1 nm increment the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir of the freeze dried eps samples mixed with kbr mass ratio of 1 100 were acquired with a thermo nicolet is50 spectrometer ftir spectra were recorded in range of 400 4000 cm 1 the calculation method of differential zero order spectra and two dimensional ftir correlation spectrum 2d ftir cos were provided in text s7 cd spectra were scanned at far uv range 190 250 nm with j 810 chiral detector jasco japan at 25 c the spectroscopic analysis of each sample was measured in triplicate to ensure the stability of testing 3 results and discussion 3 1 molecular arrangements and dynamic characteristics of biopolymers in eps interaction among biopolymers of eps in solution could produce complex supramolecular structures md simulations can provide detailed atomic information on this microscopic process the largest cluster formed by biopolymers in the eps model system were counted and its radius of gyration rg were shown in fig 1a the molecules moved and aggregated from randomly positioned initial configurations to form clusters of molecules with larger rg and then the clusters gradually stabilized to form a compact structure meanwhile the rg values decreased the snapshot of the simulation corresponding to the molecular clusters formed at each time stage was shown in fig 1b in the first 60 ns functional groups on long chain polysaccharide molecules and some small molecules such as peptides short chain polysaccharide contacted with protein main chain to form large radius transient molecular clusters subsequently long chain polysaccharide molecules detached the remaining small molecules in the cluster gradually stabilized in contact with the protein main chain to form dense and sustaining aggregates during movement the rg of the molecular clusters gradually decreased and reached a plateau the change in rg value of the cluster indicated the system converged after 150 ns simulation therefore the last 50 ns of the simulation trajectory was chosen to analyze the dynamic structural characteristics of biopolymers in eps as shown in fig 1c the probability distribution function pdf for the distribution of molecules from the center of mass of the system showed that the protein main chain resides mostly in the core followed by peptide and amino acids while saccharide molecules were on the periphery thus peptide and amino acids molecules were predicted to be in close proximity with the protein main chain during the formation of molecular clusters dynamics cross correlation matrix dccm for the carbon atoms in biopolymer molecules was computed and shown in fig 1d where pairwise correlation coefficient reflects the degree of correlation between the motions of two atoms strong positive cross correlations are mostly between structural neighbors within the same molecule in which atomic motions with strong correlations represented off diagonal cross peaks yu and dalby 2018 swaminathan et al 1991 the molecules in eps model were grouped into 5 different classes corresponding to sequential carbon atom numbers pairwise correlations with correlation coefficients higher than 2 were observed between each component indicating the high degree of dynamic coupling between the biopolymers peptide molecules had strong positive correlations parts with both proteins and polysaccharides suggesting that peptides may play a pivotal role in the movements coupling of polysaccharide molecules and the protein main chain in contrast polysaccharide molecules had more anti correlation with the protein main chain indicating that they moved in phase but mostly in the opposite directions binding energies between the proteins main chain peptides and polysaccharide molecules were predicted for further investigation fig s4 the binding free energy between polysaccharide molecules and the protein main chain ranged from 92 795 to 250 877 kj mol favoring separation movements the predicted free energies of peptide molecules interacting with the protein main chain and polysaccharide molecules ranged from 445 323 to 82 735 kj mol and from 27 715 to 9 532 kj mol favoring spontaneous binding the binding affinity of peptides to the protein main chain is generally higher than that of polysaccharide molecules negatively charged carboxylate residues on the protein main chain contributed the most to the separation with polysaccharide molecules fig s5 van der waals vdw forces were found to play an essential role during the binding of peptide molecules to the protein main chain the contribution of each residue fig s5b showed that the hydrophobic core of the protein main chain formed by benzene rings and hydrocarbon groups exerted strong vdw forces on the hydrophobic groups in the peptide molecules the hydrophobic interactions between peptide molecules and protein main chain form the structure in which polar functional groups tend to be distributed at the periphery resulting in a high hydrophilicity of the biopolymer clusters altogether these intermolecular forces promoted the aggregation of small molecules onto large molecules of proteins and polysaccharides to form distinct sizes of agglomerates and maintained the stability of agglomerates in eps 3 2 multivalent cations influence on structural properties of eps molecular cluster 3 2 1 aggregation behavior upon addition of metal cations rg of the largest clusters in the multivalent cation eps system illustrated timescales for the aggregation and stabilization of biopolymers fig s6 all systems converged within 140 ns thus the last 50 ns of the simulation trajectory was chosen to analyze the changes in molecular structure and physical properties the distances of biopolymers from the center of mass especially those of polysaccharides significantly reduced after ca2 and al3 addition p 0 01 as shown in the pdf fig 2a and fig s7 the average diffusion coefficient d of each system fig s8a reduced with cation addition implying a potentially denser molecular network with a higher resistance to free diffusion similarly the aggregation of biomolecules was promoted and led to an increase in the effective density of the molecular clusters with the addition of multivalent cations fig s8 mg2 resulted in less effective aggregation of biopolymers as compared to ca2 and al3 the predicted aggregation behavior of eps was verified experimentally using dls the average dh and distribution of particle sizes were shown in fig s9 and fig 2b the particle size of original eps had two major distributions at 150 nm and 800 nm corresponding to the agglomerates of different sizes in eps the addition of multivalent cations led to an obvious aggregation of biopolymer in eps as evidenced by dh increased in from 547 4 nm to 883 679 7 977 6 nm respectively the peak size distribution at about 800 nm increased with ca2 and al3 but not with mg2 the interchain electrostatic repulsion of biopolymers in eps was reduced due to electric neutralization by multivalent cations fig s10 as the particle size distribution of eps gradually narrowed resulting in the aggregation of biopolymers and formation of more dense eps colloids ying et al 2010 three multivalent cations ca2 mg2 and al3 showed different aggregation behavior with eps as predicted by the simulation results ca2 and al3 showed greater facilitation effects than mg2 with the formation of larger dh and denser agglomerates at the same concentration 3 2 2 molecular polarity structural changes in molecular clusters affected the surface properties solvent accessible surface area sasa can reflect the exposure area of biopolymers to solvents which was partitioned into hydrophobic hpo and hydrophilic hpi components according to the atomic partial charges lan et al 2022 devarajan et al 2020 as shown in fig 3a biopolymer molecules had large areas of both hpo 117 39 nm2 and hpi 176 17 nm2 components the sasa of biomolecules decreased after the addition of multivalent cations and the greater reduction in hpi area indicated the stronger effects of multivalent cations on polar functional groups xad fractionation resulted in separation of eps into hpo transitional hydrophilic tpi and hpi components fig 3b and fig s11 with each component in the raw eps sample accounted for 38 13 and 49 respectively as expected eps was rich in both hydrophilic and hydrophobic components the addition of multivalent cations caused the conversion of hpi components into tpi components followed by further conversion into hpo components different elements contributed to the total sasa fig s12a with the following order o h c n s oxygen is the element that most obviously affected by the multivalent cations suggesting that oxygen containing functional groups played a crucial role in the interaction between multivalent cations and biopolymers in addition the coordination of polar functional groups by multivalent cations disrupted the hydrogen bonding between biopolymers and water molecules fig s12b surface hydrophobicity of eps also increased after the addition of multivalent cations with bound bpb increased from 0 49 to 0 74 0 79 and 0 91 μg for 5 mmol g eps addition of ca2 mg2 and al3 respectively fig s13 thus the interaction of multivalent cations on polar functional groups caused the agglomeration and structural rearrangement of biopolymers leading to a reduced exposure of hydrophilic components on the eps surface 3 2 3 gel like network structural strength contact between the polysaccharide molecules and the protein main chain facilitated by multivalent cations promoted their molecular interaction consequently increasing the vdw forces fig 3c and fig s4a while the neutralization of negatively charged groups by multivalent cations enhanced the electrostatic attraction between biopolymers under this condition the binding energy of biopolymer molecules was improved the rheological properties of eps were characterized to verify the predicted changes in binding energies among the biopolymers the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions provided the shear stress resistance of the gel like network structure of biopolymers in eps and allowed the flow curves behaved in a non newtonian fashion fig s14 the flow curves of eps samples were best fitted to the h b model r2 0 99 table s4 6 the τ0 yield stress and k consistency index continuously increased with increasing multivalent cations concentration fig 3d the addition of multivalent cations increased the yield stress of eps and enhanced the viscosity at high shear rates suggesting that the eps gel like network structure strength was intensified the predicted average cou force between the protein main chain and polysaccharide molecules in the mg eps system 29 9 kj mol is much lower than that in the ca eps 140 4 kj mol and al eps 99 51 kj mol system the rheological test results agree well with predictions from the simulation ca2 and al3 were more effective in enhancing the strength of the gel like network of eps than mg2 ca2 showed a more pronounced enhancement than al3 to τ0 and k of eps at low concentrations indicating that the interaction of al3 with biopolymers was compromised resulting in the destabilization of the eps colloids 3 3 coordination geometries between multivalent cations and biopolymers among the anionic functional groups on biopolymers associated with multivalent cations and affecting aggregation behaviors carboxylic groups are the most abundant interaction sites for metal binding in the eps model thus the distinct coordination between the three multivalent cations and carboxyl groups was further investigated the radial distribution functions g r of multivalent cations with carboxylate o and c were analyzed to show the complex local ion carboxylate association structure fig s15 and fig s16 g r can illustrate the distance between the multivalent cations and the element on the carboxyl group when forming contact ion pairs cip and solvent separated ion pairs ssip gao 1994 multivalent cations can associate with carboxylic groups through different coordination geometries dudev and lim 2003 fig 4a schematically showed the typical configurations observed in each system carboxylic groups can bind the multivalent cations either monodentately via one of the carboxylate o atoms or bidentately via both carboxylate o atoms table s7 lists the maximum distance between multivalent cations and carboxylate c for bidentate and monodentate coordination these distances were used as the truncation distance to count the contact of the multivalent cation and carboxylate c monodentate and bidentate coordination of multivalent cations and carboxyl groups were represented by the number of contacts fig 4b the proportion of bidentate coordination last 50 ns of the simulation trajectory is ca 72 5 mg 26 2 al 45 2 fig 4c the formation of monodentate and bidentate coordination depends on the ion charge and local ligand environment in aqueous solution as the coordination of hydrated multivalent cations to carboxyl groups requires the loss of more than one water molecule in the hydrated shell dudev and lim 2004 iskrenova tchoukova et al 2010 hydration thus deteriorated the rate and efficiency of binding between mg2 al3 cations and carboxyl groups which in turn affected their connecting performance and electro neutralization efficiency for biopolymers in theory higher positive charge and a higher charge to radius ratio give al3 a shorter cip distance and a higher binding energy with carboxyl groups fig s17 enabling al3 to agglomerate more biopolymer molecules and form molecular clusters with a higher density however the ionic hydration affects the stability of interaction of al3 and the negatively charged groups on eps at low concentrations 3 mmol g eps al3 showed inferior performance in enhancing the strength of the biopolymers gel like network compared to ca2 3 4 spectroscopic analysis of interaction between eps and multivalent cations to further identify the interaction characteristics between the structure units of eps and multivalent cations spectroscopic analysis was carried out the uv vis absorbance of eps in response to the addition of ca2 was inconspicuous fig s18 indicating that ca2 does not interact with chromophore in biopolymers in contrast the normalized differential spectra of eps mg complexes fig s18b exhibited a band with peaks at 265 nm and those of eps al complexes fig s18c exhibited two predominant types of chromophores with peaks at 220 and 265 nm the band located at 220 nm was attributed to n π electron transitions of the amide bond in proteins while the band at 265 nm can be a reflection of the bindings involving aromatic and poly aromatic compounds in eps wang et al 2018 meng et al 2016 the 2d ftir cos was used to examine the covariations of functional groups of eps and multivalent cations as shown in fig 5 the synchronous map obtained from the ftir spectra of eps ca eps mg and eps al complexes all showed six predominant positive auto peaks the response degree of these peaks and the sequence of the band binding to multivalent cations were analyzed according to the noda s rule noda and ozaki 2005 table s8 and the assignments of these peaks were shown in table s9 the intensity of each positive automatic peak on the diagonal in a synchronous spectrum represents the degree of response of the corresponding functional group to the addition of multivalent cations thus the co c and coh groups in polysaccharides exhibited the highest degree of response to ca2 and al3 and amide i band of protein co showed the highest degree of response to mg2 the sequences of functional groups in eps binding to the multivalent cations can be obtained by combining the synchronous and the asynchronous spectra the amide ii band of protein nh showed the fastest response to the addition of ca2 while the amide i band of protein co was most sensitive to mg2 and al3 the secondary structure of proteins which can be reflected by protein amide bands is highly sensitive to metal ions yang et al 2015 there are four categories of amide i band including β sheet 1630 1640 cm 1 random coil 1640 1650 cm 1 α helix 1650 1660 cm 1 and β turn 1680 1690 cm 1 were then analyzed table s10 fig s19 β turn had the highest degree of response to ca2 and mg2 and α helix showed the highest degree of response to al3 to gain more insights into the change in protein secondary structure the cd spectrum was used fig 5b and fig s20 the α helix had two negative peaks at 209 nm and 221 nm while β sheet showed one positive peak at 197 nm wang et al 2021 the characteristic peaks of protein α helix and β sheet structure were flattened out indicating that the multivalent cations altered the conformation of protein molecules sheng et al 2013 reported that the binding capacity of multivalent cations through the complexation was stronger than through electrostatic interactions thus the interaction with mg2 and al3 led to a more obvious alteration in the secondary structure than ca2 the disruption of protein secondary structure induced the exposure of hydrophobic groups zeng et al 2014 wu et al 2017 so eps flocculated by mg2 and al3 generated more hydrophobic sites the bending and folding of the protein secondary structure allowed more exposure of polar functional groups enhancing the reactivity of proteins fig 5c multivalent cations preferentially interacted with negatively charged surface polar functional groups of macromolecular proteins in the binding process resulting in structural changes in the α helix and β sheet then multivalent cations promoted the bridging among macromolecular biopolymers by coordinating with the polar groups on different biopolymers resulting in a substantial change in molecular structure of biopolymers 3 5 environmental implications eps are known to be crucial in biological wastewater treatment process whereas the complex heterogeneous properties of eps hindered investigations in detailed physical and structural mechanisms sheng et al 2010 seviour et al 2019 the recognition of biopolymer cluster structures and surface functional group composition of eps is expected to advance the understanding of physical properties of the eps at molecular level and enrich the theoretical basis of wastewater biotreatment process optimization in this study we built eps models and applied all atom simulations to explore the aggregation kinetics and structural distribution of biopolymers in the presence of multivalent cations ca2 mg2 al3 for the first time among them al3 with a higher positive charge and shorter coordination distance can agglomerate more biopolymers to form denser more stable clusters however hydration affected the association of cations with polar functional groups for al3 but marginally for ca2 these characteristics can be used to guide the application of multivalent cations in wastewater treatment processes for instance the aggregation of biopolymers and disruption of the secondary structure of protein can enhance the hydrophobicity of eps facilitating more efficient solid liquid separation in flocculation processes alam et al 2016 the predominant association of ca2 and al3 with functional groups in polysaccharides can significantly contribute to the granulation speed and viscosity of granular sludge enhancing reactor operating efficiency through biofilm and granule formation jia et al 2017 sajjad and kim 2015 the coagulation efficiency of al3 in biomass harvesting process can be improved by controlling ph to minimize its hydration for practical applications reducing the concentration of cations with high coagulation efficiency such as ca2 and al3 can higher inhibit membrane fouling and pipeline blockage wang et al 2015 in addition novel insights into the spontaneous agglomeration behavior and distribution of biopolymers during eps formation were provided by md simulations more importantly the simulation data offered a microscopic explanation for the various properties of eps the development and refinement of molecular models of biopolymers can facilitate the optimization of treatment processes based on molecular structure characteristics of eps clusters such as the design and selection of efficient flocculants for wastewater treatment and sludge conditioning dewatering this study provided a blueprint for advancing the computational modeling of eps more realistic eps models and larger time scale simulation can be obtained by future development of molecular characterization techniques and computational power 4 conclusion biopolymers aggregated by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and formed dynamic clusters with a large number of negatively charged polar functional groups on its surface the electrostatic repulsion between the clusters prevented further agglomeration of eps aggregates in the presence of multivalent cations the interaction between multivalent cations and the polar groups connected the biopolymers caused the rearrangement of the eps molecular structure to form large dense agglomerates the reduction in solvent contact area and surface polar functional groups of the biopolymer enhanced its hydrophobicity and the promotion of biopolymers aggregation by multivalent cations increased their binding free energy leading to an increase in the strength of the gel like network of eps the predominant association of functional groups in polysaccharides with ca2 and al3 obviously promoted the agglomeration of macromolecules and enhanced the viscosity between biopolymers mg2 and al3 disrupted the secondary structure of the protein resulting in the exposure of more hydrophobic interaction sites al3 with more positive charge and shorter coordination distance could agglomerate more biopolymer molecules and form molecular clusters with higher density and size but the hydration of al3 affected its association with polar functional groups resulting in a reduction in the effectiveness of al3

china the basic properties of as were provided in supporting information si table s1 eps was extracted using the cation exchange resin cer technique frølund et al 1996 the detailed procedures of eps extraction are described in previous study peng et al 2021 with purified samples stored at 4 c before analysis the organic content of eps was shown in table s2 2 2 eps model construction and md details the molecular model of eps contains 9 protein molecules consists of 1 macromolecular protein main chain molecule and 8 polypeptide molecules 3 polysaccharide molecules consists of 1 macromolecular polysaccharide molecule and 2 short chain polysaccharide molecules 20 amino acid molecules contains 10 hydrophilic amino acids and 10 hydrophobic amino acids and 10 monosaccharide molecules the selected biopolymers in the eps model were referred to the composition of biopolymers in extracted eps and the structure properties of biopolymers proved in previous studies the methylmalonyl coa epimerase is a key enzyme in breakdown of odd numbered fatty acid during wastewater treatment process mccarthy et al 2001 which was chosen as the representative macromolecular protein main chain the polypeptide models structures were referred to the peptides in the aquatic dom proposed by devarajan devarajan et al 2020 the structure of polysaccharide models were established based on the granulan eps identified by seviour et al 2012 and alginate like exopolysaccharides proposed by lin et al 2010 alanine ala and threonine thr were selected as representative hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid models as they are the dominant amino acids in sludge organic matters li et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 guluronic acid was chosen as the monosaccharide model molecule detailed information of biopolymer component units in the eps model was given in text s2 and table s3 all the simulations were performed using gromacs 2020 6 program in tip3p h2o model with the charmm36 force field jorgensen et al 1983 mackerell et al 1998 the models were simulated for a total of 200 ns with additional details on the computation and analysis of trajectories given in test s3 4 2 3 interaction between eps and multivalent cations multivalent cation solutions were prepared by dissolving cacl2 mgcl2 and alcl3 of analytical grade sinopharm chemical reagents co ltd in china in ultrapure water and filtered through 0 22 μm membranes to fit the requirements of organic matter concentration in different tests eps were dilute by ultrapure water to target concentrations determined by dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations binding experiments were carried out by adding 50 ml of multivalent cations solution to a series of brown sealed vials containing 50 ml of eps solution the molar ratio dosage of multivalent cations was dependent on the doc of eps the tested range of multivalent cation concentration was 0 5 mmol g eps with increments of 1 mmol g eps in the physical properties test and 0 5 mmol g eps in the spectroscopy tests the initial ph was adjusted to 7 using 0 2 mol l hcl and 0 2 mol l naoh mixed samples were shaken immediately at 200 rpm for 12 h under 25 c to ensure complexation equilibrium 2 4 characterization of eps properties the polarity of eps was evaluated by the component content fractionated using amberlite xad 4 xad 8 resins the hydrophobicity of eps was analyzed by the binding ability with hydrophobic chromophore bromophenol blue bpb details for fractionation methods and bpb bind ability measurement were provided in text s5 the floc strength of biopolymer micelles in eps was evaluated by rheological test hershel bulkley h b pseudoplastic and newton models were used to fit the eps flow curve respectively the details about rheological testing procedure and data simulation were provided in text s6 the hydrodynamic diameters dh of biopolymer micelles in eps were measured by dls analysis via a malvern zetasizer nano zs malvern uk a monochromatic coherent he ne laser with a fixed wavelength of 633 nm was used as a light source the signal of scattered light intensity was detected at 90 the signal was then calculated to obtain intensity mean size z average diameter and distribution of particle sizes the physical properties of each sample were measured at least 3 times and data were presented as mean standard deviation 2 5 spectroscopic analysis of interaction between eps and multivalent cations uv vis absorption spectra was measured using a uv 1900 spectrometer shimadzu duisburg japan over a wavelength range of 190 600 nm with 1 nm increment the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir of the freeze dried eps samples mixed with kbr mass ratio of 1 100 were acquired with a thermo nicolet is50 spectrometer ftir spectra were recorded in range of 400 4000 cm 1 the calculation method of differential zero order spectra and two dimensional ftir correlation spectrum 2d ftir cos were provided in text s7 cd spectra were scanned at far uv range 190 250 nm with j 810 chiral detector jasco japan at 25 c the spectroscopic analysis of each sample was measured in triplicate to ensure the stability of testing 3 results and discussion 3 1 molecular arrangements and dynamic characteristics of biopolymers in eps interaction among biopolymers of eps in solution could produce complex supramolecular structures md simulations can provide detailed atomic information on this microscopic process the largest cluster formed by biopolymers in the eps model system were counted and its radius of gyration rg were shown in fig 1a the molecules moved and aggregated from randomly positioned initial configurations to form clusters of molecules with larger rg and then the clusters gradually stabilized to form a compact structure meanwhile the rg values decreased the snapshot of the simulation corresponding to the molecular clusters formed at each time stage was shown in fig 1b in the first 60 ns functional groups on long chain polysaccharide molecules and some small molecules such as peptides short chain polysaccharide contacted with protein main chain to form large radius transient molecular clusters subsequently long chain polysaccharide molecules detached the remaining small molecules in the cluster gradually stabilized in contact with the protein main chain to form dense and sustaining aggregates during movement the rg of the molecular clusters gradually decreased and reached a plateau the change in rg value of the cluster indicated the system converged after 150 ns simulation therefore the last 50 ns of the simulation trajectory was chosen to analyze the dynamic structural characteristics of biopolymers in eps as shown in fig 1c the probability distribution function pdf for the distribution of molecules from the center of mass of the system showed that the protein main chain resides mostly in the core followed by peptide and amino acids while saccharide molecules were on the periphery thus peptide and amino acids molecules were predicted to be in close proximity with the protein main chain during the formation of molecular clusters dynamics cross correlation matrix dccm for the carbon atoms in biopolymer molecules was computed and shown in fig 1d where pairwise correlation coefficient reflects the degree of correlation between the motions of two atoms strong positive cross correlations are mostly between structural neighbors within the same molecule in which atomic motions with strong correlations represented off diagonal cross peaks yu and dalby 2018 swaminathan et al 1991 the molecules in eps model were grouped into 5 different classes corresponding to sequential carbon atom numbers pairwise correlations with correlation coefficients higher than 2 were observed between each component indicating the high degree of dynamic coupling between the biopolymers peptide molecules had strong positive correlations parts with both proteins and polysaccharides suggesting that peptides may play a pivotal role in the movements coupling of polysaccharide molecules and the protein main chain in contrast polysaccharide molecules had more anti correlation with the protein main chain indicating that they moved in phase but mostly in the opposite directions binding energies between the proteins main chain peptides and polysaccharide molecules were predicted for further investigation fig s4 the binding free energy between polysaccharide molecules and the protein main chain ranged from 92 795 to 250 877 kj mol favoring separation movements the predicted free energies of peptide molecules interacting with the protein main chain and polysaccharide molecules ranged from 445 323 to 82 735 kj mol and from 27 715 to 9 532 kj mol favoring spontaneous binding the binding affinity of peptides to the protein main chain is generally higher than that of polysaccharide molecules negatively charged carboxylate residues on the protein main chain contributed the most to the separation with polysaccharide molecules fig s5 van der waals vdw forces were found to play an essential role during the binding of peptide molecules to the protein main chain the contribution of each residue fig s5b showed that the hydrophobic core of the protein main chain formed by benzene rings and hydrocarbon groups exerted strong vdw forces on the hydrophobic groups in the peptide molecules the hydrophobic interactions between peptide molecules and protein main chain form the structure in which polar functional groups tend to be distributed at the periphery resulting in a high hydrophilicity of the biopolymer clusters altogether these intermolecular forces promoted the aggregation of small molecules onto large molecules of proteins and polysaccharides to form distinct sizes of agglomerates and maintained the stability of agglomerates in eps 3 2 multivalent cations influence on structural properties of eps molecular cluster 3 2 1 aggregation behavior upon addition of metal cations rg of the largest clusters in the multivalent cation eps system illustrated timescales for the aggregation and stabilization of biopolymers fig s6 all systems converged within 140 ns thus the last 50 ns of the simulation trajectory was chosen to analyze the changes in molecular structure and physical properties the distances of biopolymers from the center of mass especially those of polysaccharides significantly reduced after ca2 and al3 addition p 0 01 as shown in the pdf fig 2a and fig s7 the average diffusion coefficient d of each system fig s8a reduced with cation addition implying a potentially denser molecular network with a higher resistance to free diffusion similarly the aggregation of biomolecules was promoted and led to an increase in the effective density of the molecular clusters with the addition of multivalent cations fig s8 mg2 resulted in less effective aggregation of biopolymers as compared to ca2 and al3 the predicted aggregation behavior of eps was verified experimentally using dls the average dh and distribution of particle sizes were shown in fig s9 and fig 2b the particle size of original eps had two major distributions at 150 nm and 800 nm corresponding to the agglomerates of different sizes in eps the addition of multivalent cations led to an obvious aggregation of biopolymer in eps as evidenced by dh increased in from 547 4 nm to 883 679 7 977 6 nm respectively the peak size distribution at about 800 nm increased with ca2 and al3 but not with mg2 the interchain electrostatic repulsion of biopolymers in eps was reduced due to electric neutralization by multivalent cations fig s10 as the particle size distribution of eps gradually narrowed resulting in the aggregation of biopolymers and formation of more dense eps colloids ying et al 2010 three multivalent cations ca2 mg2 and al3 showed different aggregation behavior with eps as predicted by the simulation results ca2 and al3 showed greater facilitation effects than mg2 with the formation of larger dh and denser agglomerates at the same concentration 3 2 2 molecular polarity structural changes in molecular clusters affected the surface properties solvent accessible surface area sasa can reflect the exposure area of biopolymers to solvents which was partitioned into hydrophobic hpo and hydrophilic hpi components according to the atomic partial charges lan et al 2022 devarajan et al 2020 as shown in fig 3a biopolymer molecules had large areas of both hpo 117 39 nm2 and hpi 176 17 nm2 components the sasa of biomolecules decreased after the addition of multivalent cations and the greater reduction in hpi area indicated the stronger effects of multivalent cations on polar functional groups xad fractionation resulted in separation of eps into hpo transitional hydrophilic tpi and hpi components fig 3b and fig s11 with each component in the raw eps sample accounted for 38 13 and 49 respectively as expected eps was rich in both hydrophilic and hydrophobic components the addition of multivalent cations caused the conversion of hpi components into tpi components followed by further conversion into hpo components different elements contributed to the total sasa fig s12a with the following order o h c n s oxygen is the element that most obviously affected by the multivalent cations suggesting that oxygen containing functional groups played a crucial role in the interaction between multivalent cations and biopolymers in addition the coordination of polar functional groups by multivalent cations disrupted the hydrogen bonding between biopolymers and water molecules fig s12b surface hydrophobicity of eps also increased after the addition of multivalent cations with bound bpb increased from 0 49 to 0 74 0 79 and 0 91 μg for 5 mmol g eps addition of ca2 mg2 and al3 respectively fig s13 thus the interaction of multivalent cations on polar functional groups caused the agglomeration and structural rearrangement of biopolymers leading to a reduced exposure of hydrophilic components on the eps surface 3 2 3 gel like network structural strength contact between the polysaccharide molecules and the protein main chain facilitated by multivalent cations promoted their molecular interaction consequently increasing the vdw forces fig 3c and fig s4a while the neutralization of negatively charged groups by multivalent cations enhanced the electrostatic attraction between biopolymers under this condition the binding energy of biopolymer molecules was improved the rheological properties of eps were characterized to verify the predicted changes in binding energies among the biopolymers the electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions provided the shear stress resistance of the gel like network structure of biopolymers in eps and allowed the flow curves behaved in a non newtonian fashion fig s14 the flow curves of eps samples were best fitted to the h b model r2 0 99 table s4 6 the τ0 yield stress and k consistency index continuously increased with increasing multivalent cations concentration fig 3d the addition of multivalent cations increased the yield stress of eps and enhanced the viscosity at high shear rates suggesting that the eps gel like network structure strength was intensified the predicted average cou force between the protein main chain and polysaccharide molecules in the mg eps system 29 9 kj mol is much lower than that in the ca eps 140 4 kj mol and al eps 99 51 kj mol system the rheological test results agree well with predictions from the simulation ca2 and al3 were more effective in enhancing the strength of the gel like network of eps than mg2 ca2 showed a more pronounced enhancement than al3 to τ0 and k of eps at low concentrations indicating that the interaction of al3 with biopolymers was compromised resulting in the destabilization of the eps colloids 3 3 coordination geometries between multivalent cations and biopolymers among the anionic functional groups on biopolymers associated with multivalent cations and affecting aggregation behaviors carboxylic groups are the most abundant interaction sites for metal binding in the eps model thus the distinct coordination between the three multivalent cations and carboxyl groups was further investigated the radial distribution functions g r of multivalent cations with carboxylate o and c were analyzed to show the complex local ion carboxylate association structure fig s15 and fig s16 g r can illustrate the distance between the multivalent cations and the element on the carboxyl group when forming contact ion pairs cip and solvent separated ion pairs ssip gao 1994 multivalent cations can associate with carboxylic groups through different coordination geometries dudev and lim 2003 fig 4a schematically showed the typical configurations observed in each system carboxylic groups can bind the multivalent cations either monodentately via one of the carboxylate o atoms or bidentately via both carboxylate o atoms table s7 lists the maximum distance between multivalent cations and carboxylate c for bidentate and monodentate coordination these distances were used as the truncation distance to count the contact of the multivalent cation and carboxylate c monodentate and bidentate coordination of multivalent cations and carboxyl groups were represented by the number of contacts fig 4b the proportion of bidentate coordination last 50 ns of the simulation trajectory is ca 72 5 mg 26 2 al 45 2 fig 4c the formation of monodentate and bidentate coordination depends on the ion charge and local ligand environment in aqueous solution as the coordination of hydrated multivalent cations to carboxyl groups requires the loss of more than one water molecule in the hydrated shell dudev and lim 2004 iskrenova tchoukova et al 2010 hydration thus deteriorated the rate and efficiency of binding between mg2 al3 cations and carboxyl groups which in turn affected their connecting performance and electro neutralization efficiency for biopolymers in theory higher positive charge and a higher charge to radius ratio give al3 a shorter cip distance and a higher binding energy with carboxyl groups fig s17 enabling al3 to agglomerate more biopolymer molecules and form molecular clusters with a higher density however the ionic hydration affects the stability of interaction of al3 and the negatively charged groups on eps at low concentrations 3 mmol g eps al3 showed inferior performance in enhancing the strength of the biopolymers gel like network compared to ca2 3 4 spectroscopic analysis of interaction between eps and multivalent cations to further identify the interaction characteristics between the structure units of eps and multivalent cations spectroscopic analysis was carried out the uv vis absorbance of eps in response to the addition of ca2 was inconspicuous fig s18 indicating that ca2 does not interact with chromophore in biopolymers in contrast the normalized differential spectra of eps mg complexes fig s18b exhibited a band with peaks at 265 nm and those of eps al complexes fig s18c exhibited two predominant types of chromophores with peaks at 220 and 265 nm the band located at 220 nm was attributed to n π electron transitions of the amide bond in proteins while the band at 265 nm can be a reflection of the bindings involving aromatic and poly aromatic compounds in eps wang et al 2018 meng et al 2016 the 2d ftir cos was used to examine the covariations of functional groups of eps and multivalent cations as shown in fig 5 the synchronous map obtained from the ftir spectra of eps ca eps mg and eps al complexes all showed six predominant positive auto peaks the response degree of these peaks and the sequence of the band binding to multivalent cations were analyzed according to the noda s rule noda and ozaki 2005 table s8 and the assignments of these peaks were shown in table s9 the intensity of each positive automatic peak on the diagonal in a synchronous spectrum represents the degree of response of the corresponding functional group to the addition of multivalent cations thus the co c and coh groups in polysaccharides exhibited the highest degree of response to ca2 and al3 and amide i band of protein co showed the highest degree of response to mg2 the sequences of functional groups in eps binding to the multivalent cations can be obtained by combining the synchronous and the asynchronous spectra the amide ii band of protein nh showed the fastest response to the addition of ca2 while the amide i band of protein co was most sensitive to mg2 and al3 the secondary structure of proteins which can be reflected by protein amide bands is highly sensitive to metal ions yang et al 2015 there are four categories of amide i band including β sheet 1630 1640 cm 1 random coil 1640 1650 cm 1 α helix 1650 1660 cm 1 and β turn 1680 1690 cm 1 were then analyzed table s10 fig s19 β turn had the highest degree of response to ca2 and mg2 and α helix showed the highest degree of response to al3 to gain more insights into the change in protein secondary structure the cd spectrum was used fig 5b and fig s20 the α helix had two negative peaks at 209 nm and 221 nm while β sheet showed one positive peak at 197 nm wang et al 2021 the characteristic peaks of protein α helix and β sheet structure were flattened out indicating that the multivalent cations altered the conformation of protein molecules sheng et al 2013 reported that the binding capacity of multivalent cations through the complexation was stronger than through electrostatic interactions thus the interaction with mg2 and al3 led to a more obvious alteration in the secondary structure than ca2 the disruption of protein secondary structure induced the exposure of hydrophobic groups zeng et al 2014 wu et al 2017 so eps flocculated by mg2 and al3 generated more hydrophobic sites the bending and folding of the protein secondary structure allowed more exposure of polar functional groups enhancing the reactivity of proteins fig 5c multivalent cations preferentially interacted with negatively charged surface polar functional groups of macromolecular proteins in the binding process resulting in structural changes in the α helix and β sheet then multivalent cations promoted the bridging among macromolecular biopolymers by coordinating with the polar groups on different biopolymers resulting in a substantial change in molecular structure of biopolymers 3 5 environmental implications eps are known to be crucial in biological wastewater treatment process whereas the complex heterogeneous properties of eps hindered investigations in detailed physical and structural mechanisms sheng et al 2010 seviour et al 2019 the recognition of biopolymer cluster structures and surface functional group composition of eps is expected to advance the understanding of physical properties of the eps at molecular level and enrich the theoretical basis of wastewater biotreatment process optimization in this study we built eps models and applied all atom simulations to explore the aggregation kinetics and structural distribution of biopolymers in the presence of multivalent cations ca2 mg2 al3 for the first time among them al3 with a higher positive charge and shorter coordination distance can agglomerate more biopolymers to form denser more stable clusters however hydration affected the association of cations with polar functional groups for al3 but marginally for ca2 these characteristics can be used to guide the application of multivalent cations in wastewater treatment processes for instance the aggregation of biopolymers and disruption of the secondary structure of protein can enhance the hydrophobicity of eps facilitating more efficient solid liquid separation in flocculation processes alam et al 2016 the predominant association of ca2 and al3 with functional groups in polysaccharides can significantly contribute to the granulation speed and viscosity of granular sludge enhancing reactor operating efficiency through biofilm and granule formation jia et al 2017 sajjad and kim 2015 the coagulation efficiency of al3 in biomass harvesting process can be improved by controlling ph to minimize its hydration for practical applications reducing the concentration of cations with high coagulation efficiency such as ca2 and al3 can higher inhibit membrane fouling and pipeline blockage wang et al 2015 in addition novel insights into the spontaneous agglomeration behavior and distribution of biopolymers during eps formation were provided by md simulations more importantly the simulation data offered a microscopic explanation for the various properties of eps the development and refinement of molecular models of biopolymers can facilitate the optimization of treatment processes based on molecular structure characteristics of eps clusters such as the design and selection of efficient flocculants for wastewater treatment and sludge conditioning dewatering this study provided a blueprint for advancing the computational modeling of eps more realistic eps models and larger time scale simulation can be obtained by future development of molecular characterization techniques and computational power 4 conclusion biopolymers aggregated by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and formed dynamic clusters with a large number of negatively charged polar functional groups on its surface the electrostatic repulsion between the clusters prevented further agglomeration of eps aggregates in the presence of multivalent cations the interaction between multivalent cations and the polar groups connected the biopolymers caused the rearrangement of the eps molecular structure to form large dense agglomerates the reduction in solvent contact area and surface polar functional groups of the biopolymer enhanced its hydrophobicity and the promotion of biopolymers aggregation by multivalent cations increased their binding free energy leading to an increase in the strength of the gel like network of eps the predominant association of functional groups in polysaccharides with ca2 and al3 obviously promoted the agglomeration of macromolecules and enhanced the viscosity between biopolymers mg2 and al3 disrupted the secondary structure of the protein resulting in the exposure of more hydrophobic interaction sites al3 with more positive charge and shorter coordination distance could agglomerate more biopolymer molecules and form molecular clusters with higher density and size but the hydration of al3 affected its association with polar functional groups resulting in a reduction in the effectiveness of al3

15026,as an oxidant peracetic acid paa is gradually applied in advanced oxidation processes aops for pollutants degradation due to its high oxidation and low toxicity in this study the prepared co2fe1 ldh showed excellent paa activation ability for efficient degradation of various pharmaceuticals with a removal efficiency ranging from 82 3 to 100 taking sulfamethoxazole smx as a model pharmaceutical it s found that organic radical r o with high concentration of 5 27 10 13 m is the dominant ros responsible for contaminants degradation further analysis demonstrated that bimetallic synergistic effect between co and fe can improve electron transfer ability of co2fe1 ldh resulting in the accelerated conversion of co from 3 to 2 valence state with a high reaction rate 4 3 101 1 483 102 m 1 s 1 in this system density functional theory dft reveals that c1 c3 c5 and n11 with higher ƒ0 and ƒ values concentrated on aniline group of smx are the main attack sites which is consistent with the results of degradation products besides co2fe1 ldh paa system can effectively reduce biological toxicity after reaction due to lower biotoxicity of degradation products and the carbon sources provided by paa in application co2fe1 ldh paa system was capable of resisting the influence of water matrix and effectively removing pollutants in actual hospital wastewater importantly this study comprehensively evaluated the ability of co2fe1 ldh paa system to remove organics and improve the biodegradability of actual hospital wastewater providing guidance for application of paa activation system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid activation hospital wastewater treatment pharmaceuticals removal layered double hydroxides ldh bimetallic synergistic effect data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater like hospital wastewater containing refractory pharmaceuticals and bacteria can greatly threaten aquatic organisms and human health kovalova et al 2012 ort et al 2010 weissbrodt et al 2009 thus effective technologies are urgently needed to simultaneously remove pollutants and bacteria for achieving water disinfection and decontamination among many wastewater treatment technologies advanced oxidation processes aops have gained growing acceptance for water decontamination hodges et al 2018 miklos et al 2018 yun et al 2017 wei et al 2022 li et al 2019 peracetic acid paa is an organic peroxyacid that has been widely used in wastewater disinfection owing to its high disinfection efficiency and low level of formation of harmful disinfection byproducts dbps koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 luukkonen et al 2015 in addition to disinfection paa as a strong oxidizing agent 1 96 v vs nhe can be used in aops for removing contaminants ao et al 2021 which is attracting greater interest in research and applications up to now a lot of strategies have been provided to activate paa for contaminants removal ao et al 2021 and metal based catalysts often have better catalytic ability than other catalysts several studies have investigated the feasibility of activating paa by transition metals containing homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts ao et al 2021 co ion fe ion ru ion and fes have been used to activate paa and showed efficient activation capability kim et al 2019 li et al 2021 wang et al 2020b yang et al 2022 while it is difficult to recycle homogeneous catalysts due to high metal dissolution despite other heterogeneous metal catalysts such as cobalt oxides wu et al 2020 cofe2o4 wang et al 2021a and mno2 rokhina et al 2010 have been applied to paa activation they are faced with the problems of high metal leaching and low activity therefore it is critical to develop and design catalysts with high catalytic activity low cost easy synthesis and recycling layered double hydroxides ldhs as a class of two dimensional layered anionic clays have been widely applied in aops to degrade contaminants in wastewater guo et al 2010 xie et al 2021 because of the following outstanding advantages i ldhs are easy to synthesize with low cost and can immobilize various metal ions to improve the catalytic performance ii their ph buffering ability is able to keep ph around neutral benefitting to the activation of paa iii the stable structure of ldh based catalyst can reduce the metal leaching and promote the reusability it has been proved that co and fe ions possessed high catalytic ability for paa activation kim et al 2019 wang et al 2020b thus ldh containing both co and fe may greatly increase catalytic activity the generated ros in cofe ldh paa may be abundant and different from that in co paa and fe paa systems and bimetallic synergic effect may arise in the process of cofe ldh activating paa unfortunately there is limited information on how cofe ldh activates paa for removing contaminants and whether bimetallic synergic effect occurs in the activation process hospital wastewater is a kind of wastewater with complex components such as pathogenic microorganisms pharmaceuticals and their metabolites antibiotics resistance genes and contrast agents azuma et al 2019 lien et al 2016 wallmann et al 2021 which can spread diseases and pollute the environment especially various pharmaceuticals remained in wastewater will seriously threaten the ecological environment and human health azuma et al 2019 lien et al 2016 pharmaceutical contaminants in hospital wastewater with various types strong biological toxicity and complex molecular structure which are difficult to be effectively removed by traditional biological treatment processes casas et al 2015 kovalova et al 2012 although aops have been used for pharmaceuticals degradation with high removal efficiency wang et al 2022 xia et al 2020 xie et al 2022 water matrix such as inorganic anions and dissolved organic matters in actual hospital wastewater will greatly affect degradation efficiency dong et al 2022 kovalova et al 2013 meanwhile in some aops reaction systems the biological toxicity of the system after reaction is higher than that before reaction dong et al 2022 rayaroth et al 2022 which is harmful to the environment or the following biological treatment system as an organic peroxyacid and a disinfectant paa can be used in aops to degrade pharmaceuticals with high efficiency and low toxicity ao et al 2021 da silva et al 2020 however most of the research only focuses on one pollutant such as smx ao et al 2021 wang et al 2020a and there is almost no relevant research on its application in actual hospital wastewater in this study a cost effective co2fe1 ldh was successfully synthesized and analyzed by various characterization methods various pharmaceuticals including antibiotics psychotropic drugs and pain relievers were selected to evaluate the ability of co2fe1 ldh activating paa the ros produced in the co2fe1 ldh paa was detected by quenching experiments probe compound tests and electron paramagnetic resonance epr furthermore the bimetallic synergistic activation effect of co2fe1 ldh was explored and verified by experiment and electrochemical characterization and at the same time the second order reaction rate constant of the synergistic reaction in this system was calculated density functional theory dft was applied to analyze the speculated active sites and easily broken chemical bonds of the typical contaminant whereafter the biotoxicity of smx and its degradation products were evaluated in co2fe1 ldh paa system finally this research also assessed the effects of water matrix on the degradation rate and more importantly explored the application of co2fe1 ldh paa system in actual hospital wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods the information of the selected chemicals and reagents and their sources is provided in the supporting information text s1 cofe ldh synthesis method experimental procedures characterizations and analytical methods are stated in texts s2 s5 respectively and the corresponding characterization results are illustrated in figs s1 s3 additionally the details of dft calculations and fukui function indexes are shown in text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances of pharmaceuticals degradation as stated in text s7 according to multiple characterization results the co2fe1 ldh was successfully synthesized in this work next to better evaluate the ability of co2fe1 ldh activating paa five pharmaceuticals classified as antibiotics psychotropic drugs and pain relievers including smx sulfisoxazole siz sulfamerazine smr naproxen nap and carbamazepine cbz were degraded in the same reaction conditions paa 0 2 mm co2fe1 ldh 50 mg l contaminant 20 μm ph 6 4 t 25 c and reaction time 30 min respectively as depicted in fig 1 a b the degradation efficiencies of smx smr siz nap and cbz were 95 3 kobs 0 118 min 1 82 3 kobs 0 067 min 1 99 5 kobs 0 282 min 1 100 kobs 0 307 min 1 and 89 7 kobs 0 085 min 1 respectively further experiments results indicated that the dominant removal way for these five contaminants is ros degradation rather than adsorption and direct oxidation of paa fig s4 additionally taking smx as an example more than 56 of toc was removed during the reaction text s5 and fig s5 in contrast to other common peroxyacid oxidants such as h2o2 and peroxydisulfate pds smx removal rate for paa 95 3 was distinctly higher than that in pds 19 4 and h2o2 9 7 system fig s6 the cost effectiveness ce analysis text s8 indicates that paa has a lower ce value in comparison with pds and h2o2 is hard to be activated by co2fe1 ldh above results demonstrated that paa as a peroxyacid oxidant is sensitive to be activated by co2fe1 ldh and has enormous potential in degrading pharmaceuticals the degradation performance of pollutants will be affected by reaction parameters such as proportion of metal ions co2fe1 ldh dosage paa concentration and initial ph of solution text s9 and can be maximized under optimal reaction conditions paa 0 2 mm co2fe1 ldh 50 mg l contaminant 20 μm ph 6 4 it is worth mentioning that the optimal reaction parameters are almost the same for other contaminants like siz fig s8 in addition co2fe1 ldh shows excellent stability and reusability figs s10 and s11 specifically co2fe1 ldh can control ions leaching in a lower range in each recycling process co 100 ppb and fe 10 ppb fig s12 and maintain the catalytic performance at a high level 78 6 95 3 of smx even after four cycles 3 2 ros evaluation as mentioned above the degradation of contaminants in co2fe1 ldh paa system was almost induced by ros oxidation h2o2 contained in paa solution has a weak impact on contaminants degradation fig s6 which may arise from the higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy elumo h2o2 0 69 ev elumo paa 0 26 ev and higher o oh bond energy paa 38 kcal mol 1 h2o2 52 kcal mol 1 table s3 which has the side effect on the activation of h2o2 thus paa is more susceptive to be activated by co2fe1 ldh and controls the generation of ros in the catalytic process subsequently to better explore the type of ros produced in this catalytic activation epr analysis quenching and chemical probes experiments were conducted in this part 3 2 1 quenching experiments firstly tert butanol tba is a well known oh scavenger at a high reaction rate constant of 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 but does not affect the carbon centered radicals r o such as acetyloxyl radical ch3co2 and acetylperoxy radical ch3co3 cai et al 2017 wang et al 2020b 2 4 hd can react rapidly with oh k 1 1010 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and can also act as the scavenger for ch3c o o or ch3c o oo k 5 108 m 1 s 1 because 2 4 hd containing with cc bond that is easily attacked by acetyl per oxyl radicals chateauneuf et al 1988 kim et al 2020 on the basis of these rate constants 2 4 hd can scavenge both oh and r o additionally high valent metal species like fe iv and co iv can react with methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso or dimethyl sulfoxides dmso with a higher reaction rate constant about 105 106 m 1 s 1 than other quenching agents like k fe iv meoh 5 72 102 m 1 s 1 k fe iv etoh 2 51 103 m 1 s 1 and k fe iv tba 6 0 101 m 1 s 1 kim et al 2019 pestovsky and bakac 2004 2006 hence pmso is widely used as the scavenger of high valent metal species kim et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 liu et al 2021 accordingly tba 2 4 hd meoh and pmso were used in the next quenching experiments to identify ros produced in this system as a result taking smx as an example fig 2 a only about 6 3 of smx was inhibited when low 20 mm or high 200 mm concentration of tba was introduced into reaction solution indicating that oh played a minor role in removing contaminants afterward the degradation efficiency of smx decreased distinctly when low or high concentration of 2 4 hd 10 or 20 mm was added inferring that both oh and r o were involved in the process but r o acted as the dominant role additionally meoh as a commonly used quencher for reactive radicals can scavenge r o ch3c o o and ch3c o oo and other radicals in paa activation system ao et al 2021 obviously compared with tba and 2 4 hd 20 or 200 mm of meoh could significantly suppress the degradation of smx about 87 5 smx was suppressed when 200 mm meoh was added and the inhibiting effect was visibly higher than that in tba 6 3 and slightly higher than that in 2 4 hd 84 7 this phenomenon testifies that not only oh and r o but also other radicals such as ch3 and ho2 can be quenched by meoh while other radicals make a negligible contribution to the smx degradation finally when excess pmso 0 1 mm was introduced about 10 4 of smx was inhibited this result demonstrated that high valent metal species like fe iv and co iv served as a minor role in the degradation process of contaminants to further verify high valent metal species pmso2 conversion rate experiment was conducted the obtained conversion rate was only 5 7 fig s14 demonstrating that the amount of high valent metal species like co iv is very limited in addition furfuryl alcohol ffa and p benzoquinone p bq can be used to quench 1o2 and o2 respectively li et al 2022 as seen in figs s15 and s16 the degradation of smx is hardly inhibited demonstrating that almost no 1o2 and o2 are produced in co2fe1 ldh paa system it is worth noting that quenching agents pmso meoh tba p bq ffa and 2 4 hd used in the quenching experiment have weak effects on paa consumption fig s17 indicating that the inhibition of pollutant degradation is not caused by the complete consumption of paa by the quenching agents 3 2 2 epr experiments to further evaluate the ros generated in this system epr as the powerful evidence was conducted as seen in fig 2 b unexpectedly a strong signal of septet peaks attributed to dmpox 5 5 dimethyl 2 pyrrolidone n oxyl the oxidized form of dmpo wang and wang 2020 wang et al 2021b rather than direct oh or r o adducts were observed in co2fe1 ldh paa system whereafter some supplementary experiments were carried out to make clear what caused the formation of dmpox in co2fe1 ldh paa system there were no characteristic signal peaks when dmpo was added into h2o2 0 20 mm or paa 0 20 mm solution without co2fe1 ldh figs 2 b and s18 demonstrating that alone paa or h2o2 failed to result in the generation of dmpox additionally dmpox signal was also hardly obtained in co2fe1 ldh h2o2 process which could exclude the hypothesis that the generation of dmpox was induced by co2fe1 ldh and co2fe1 ldh h2o2 as shown in fig s19 typical three peaks representing temp 1o2 adducts were detected in paa solution while no signal was observed in co2fe1 ldh paa system this phenomenon can be explained by the attack of central c atom of paa by peroxy group wang et al 2020 and the rapid consumption of paa induced by co2fe1 ldh fig s17 above discussion indicated that the generated 1o2 came from the self decomposition of paa rather than the catalytic decomposition of paa induced by co2fe1 ldh based on the aforementioned discussion it can be deduced that the formation of dmpox is hardly caused by paa h2o2 co2fe1 ldh co2fe1 ldh h2o2 and 1o2 while high valence metal ions oh and r o may play roles in the oxidation of dmpo then as seen in fig 2 c when 10 mm 2 4 hd was introduced the disappeared dmpox indicated that oh and r o rather than high valence metal ions caused the generation of dmpox after adding 20 mm tba slightly decreased dmpox intensity revealed that r o rather than oh was the crucial role in causing the formation of dmpox to further confirm the existence of r o in co2fe1 ldh paa system dippmpo as a trapping agent has been used in paa activation system to detect carbon based radicals kim et al 2019 yang et al 2022 which is direct evidence for the existence of r o as shown in fig 2 d carbon centered radicals 12 line signal indicated by red dots appear in the system when the addition of dippmpo confirming the existence of r o combined with aforesaid results of quenching tests and epr high valence metal ions r o and oh were involved in this system but r o acted as the dominant role for contaminant removal in co2fe1 ldh paa system the corresponding calculated contribution ratios of different ros to contaminant degradation are as follows text s10 r o 82 27 high valence metal ions 10 94 oh 6 61 3 2 3 concentration of r o although ch3c o o and ch3c o oo are two critical r o species ch3c o oo is the main r o species and served as the major and most reactive radical for contaminants degradation kim et al 2020 kim et al 2019 wang et al 2020b to measure the steady state concentration of r o generated in this system relevant dynamic analysis models are applied because the removal of pollutants is ascribed to the oxidation of r o oh and other ros the degradation of pollutants can be expressed by eqs 1 7 and the average steady state concentration of oh and r o can be shown in eqs 8 and 9 besides after adding adequate 2 4 hd 20 mm the obtained kobs other is assigned to other ros because both r o and oh are almost completely consumed by 2 4 hd thus the kobs value of pollutants degradation jointly induced by r o and oh can be obtained by difference between kobs c and kobs other eqs 10 and 11 subsequently according to the kinetic formulas of smx and nap degradation oh ave and r o ave can be calculated by eqs 12 and 13 as seen in fig s20 the values of kobs smx kobs other and kobs nap kobs other are 0 0019 and 0 005 s 1 respectively finally based on the known data k smx oh 7 9 109 m 1 s 1 k smx r o 3 18 109 m 1 s 1 k nap oh 8 99 109 m 1 s 1 k nap r o 9 0 109 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2015 the obtained oh ave and r o ave are 2 81 10 14 m and 5 27 10 13 m respectively eqs 14 17 demonstrating that r o is easier to generate and is the predominant ros in co2fe1 ldh paa system simultaneously the degradation results of ba probe compound of oh and nap prober of r o also demonstrate that a large number of r o exists in co2fe1 ldh paa system fig s21 1 d c d t k oh c c oh k r o c c ro k other c c other 2 ln c c 0 k oh c oh d t k r o c ro d t k other c other

other c are the second order reaction rate of oh r o and other ros with contaminants the kobs oh kobs r o and kobs other represent the apparent rate constant of oh r o and other ros furthermore oh ave and r o ave are the average steady state concentration of oh and r o respectively 3 3 bimetallic synergic effect and activation mechanism 3 3 1 bimetallic synergic effect as a bimetallic catalyst bimetallic synergy effect may exist in the process of paa activation but this phenomenon has not been explored so far in order to explore whether there is bimetallic synergistic effect in paa activation process induced by co2fe1 ldh various ldhs including co ldh fe ldh and co2fe1 ldh were used in the next degradation experiments compared with single metal ldhs co ldh 62 3 k 0 075 min 1 fe ldh 14 6 k 0 021 min 1 co2fe1 ldh shows better smx removal efficiency co2fe1 ldh 95 3 k 0 118 min 1 fig 3 a exhibiting obviously synergistic effects which can be explained by the following two aspects on the one hand for heterogeneous co2fe1 ldh catalyst the surface co and fe serves as the active sites to activate paa for removing pollutant based on the above xps results fig s1 e the changed ratio of divalent and trivalent metals such as co ii and co iii on the co2fe1 ldh surface indicated that there is a conversion of divalent and trivalent metals especially the content of co ii increased from 0 453 to 0 512 after reaction which may be caused by the conversion of co iii to co ii the electrochemical performance of catalyst can be reflected by tafel curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis he et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 as shown in fig 3 b c tafel plot displayed that the co2fe1 ldh has lower free corrosion potential 0 226 v and higher corrosion current 5 69 10 7 a than co ldh 0 187 v 2 25 10 8 a and fe ldh 0 214 v 2 48 10 7 a additionally as one of methods for evaluating the electron transfer ability the arc radius of eis spectra of co2fe1 ldh is smaller than other two materials illustrating the greater electron migration capacity of co2fe1 ldh the above results of tafel curve and eis both demonstrate that the synergy of co and fe makes co2fe1 ldh possess better electrochemical performance which is beneficial for better electron transfer promoting the conversion of divalent and trivalent metals on the other hand it is widely known that dissolved homogeneous metal ions such as co2 and fe3 can also participate in catalytic reactions similarly in co2fe1 ldh paa system the maximumly released co and fe ions co2 100 ppb and fe3 10 ppb were involved in the reaction process and they could jointly activate paa to remove about 21 4 smx fig 3 d however the heterogeneous surface co ii and fe iii could eliminate more than 74 1 smx in 30 min thus playing the dominant role in the degradation process as seen in fig 3 e when 2 mg l of fe2 was introduced into co2fe1 ldh paa system the obtained k obs was 0 126 min 1 which is higher than that of alone fe2 0 012 min 1 and co2fe1 ldh paa system 0 118 min 1 according to the standard reduction potentials of co and fe the reduction of co3 by fe2 is thermodynamically feasible hence it is supposed that fe2 can react with co3 to generate co2 in the reaction process causing higher smx removal ability because co2 has better paa activation ability than fe2 and fe3 ao et al 2021 additionally this inference the fe ii in co2fe1 ldh can promote the conversion of co iii to co ii can be further evidenced by the proportion of fe3 in fe2 paa co2fe1 ldh paa and fe2 co2fe1 ldh paa system respectively text s5 as depicted in fig 3 f in fe2 paa system fe2 2 mg l paa 0 2 mm the proportion of fe3 increases rapidly from 0 to 5 min and continues to increase to about 80 at 30 min due to rapid oxidation of dissolved fe2 by paa after acid digestion the total fe and fe3 contained in 50 mg l of co2fe1 ldh were 7 84 mg l and 2 32 mg l respectively in the co2fe1 ldh paa system the ratio of fe3 was increased from 32 5 at 0 min to 66 8 at 30 min showing that the content of fe3 was enhanced after reaction theoretically the calculated ratio of fe3 in fe2 co2fe1 ldh paa was about 69 4 after reaction at 30 min while the obtained ratio of fe3 was about 76 6 at 30 min which was distinctly higher than the theoretical calculation data 69 4 demonstrating that the appearance of fe2 may promote the system to generate more fe3 as discussed above the presence of co and fe is conducive to improving the electron transfer capability of the catalyst benefiting that fe ii promotes the conversion of co iii to co ii eq 18 accordingly the reaction rate of eq 18 is measured in this study text s11 and figs s22 and s23 the obtained kobs of eq 18 is 0 256 min 1 and the corresponding second order reaction rate constant in this paa activation system is about 4 3 101 m 1 s 1 to1 483 102 m 1 s 1 18 fe ii co iii co ii fe iii 3 3 1 activation mechanism in co2fe1 ldh paa system based on the above analysis compared with fe co played a more critical role in paa activation in co2fe1 ldh paa system and both homogeneous minor pathway and heterogeneous major pathway reactions were involved in the degradation process meanwhile the bimetallic synergy is firstly observed in the paa activation process which can promote the electrochemical performance and accelerate the reduction of trivalent metals especially trivalent co to speed up the paa activation and following ros generation the main reactions in the system are inferred as follows in co2fe1 ldh paa system co ii can activate paa ch3co3h to generate co iii and ch3c o o eq 19 then co iii can react with paa to produce co ii and ch3c o oo eq 20 fe ii is oxidized by paa with formation of ch3c o o and ch3c o o and oh respectively eqs 21 23 besides fe ii can also be oxidized by paa to generate fe iv eq 24 in addition to paa fe ii fe iii can also react with h2o2 to form oh fe iv and other weak radicals like ho 2 eqs 25 27 the fe ii can promote the conversion of co iii to co ii eq 28 additionally ch3c o o can be quickly consumed by reacting with paa itself and self decomposition eqs 29 31 causing a weak effect of ch3c o o on contaminants degradation the generated oh can react with paa to form ch3c o oo with high reaction rate 9 33 0 3 108 m 1 s 1 eq 32 the main reaction mechanism in this system is shown in fig 4 and the corresponding second order reaction rates of these reactions eqs 19 32 are listed in the table s4 19 co ii c h 3 c o 3 h co iii c h 3 c o o o h 20 co iii c h 3 c o 3 h co ii c h 3 c o oo h 21 fe ii c h 3 c o 3 h fe iii c h 3 c

important indicator can be used to evaluate the reactive sites on contaminants theoretically the sites with high ƒ0 and ƒ values are vulnerable to be attacked by radical and electrophilic species respectively guo et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 firstly the optimized molecular structure of smx is shown in fig 5 a the corresponding fukui values of smx detailed in fig 5 b indicate that the atoms with high ƒ0 and ƒ values are c1 c3 c5 n11 c2 c4 c6 h12 and h13 table s5 furthermore most of atoms such as c1 c3 c5 and n11 with higher ƒ0 and ƒ values are concentrated on the aniline group showing the main attack site on sas is aniline rather than heterocyclic substituents as described in fig 5 c according to the theoretical calculation results it is inferred that the active site in the smx structure that is easy to be attacked is c1 c3 c5 and n11 on aniline group of smx and s c and s n bonds is easy to break transformation products tps of smx in the co2fe1 ldh paa system were analyzed by using uhplc qtof ms the corresponding ms and ms ms of smx were shown in fig s24 and 10 main tps with detailed information were listed in table s6 it is deduced that smx can be attacked by four main pathways in co2fe1 ldh paa system fig 5 d tp 284 is the hydroxylation product of smx pathway a which is caused by the attack of oh r o on the ortho position c3 and c5 of the amino group due to the electron donating characteristic of nh2 and electron withdrawing characteristic of so2 nh the amino n atom on smx can be attacked by radicals via one electron transfer forming n centered radicals which can react with smx itself and then form dimeric products tp 503 pathway d meanwhile due to the electron donating characteristic and higher values of f0 0 1208 and f 0 1837 of n nh2 on the aniline is sensitive to be attacked by electrophilic radicals oh r o through electron transfer mechanism forming n centered radicals which might be further oxidized to nitro substituted products tp 270 tp 282 and tp 298 pathway b besides the cleavage of s n bond and c s bond of smx occurs with the detection of some fragments tp 99 tp 158 and tp 94 pathway c which is consistent with the above theoretical calculation results fig 5 c tp 192 containing cooh may be attributed to the attack of r o like ch3c o oo on tp 176 which can indirectly prove the reaction of smx and r o the above products can be further oxidized by ros into smaller products and finally converted into co2 and h2o 3 4 2 toxicity analysis in order to assess the biological toxicity effects of smx and corresponding degradation products on the environment and organisms the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar approach was applied lai et al 2021 acute toxicity oral rat ld50 bioaccumulation factor and developmental toxicity of smx and ten intermediates were calculated using toxicity estimation software tool t e s t us epa details about the analytical methods are presented in text s12 and the obtained date is listed in table s7 as shown in fig 6 a the oral rat d50 of smx is 6203 72 mg kg which is higher than its degradation products demonstrating that the toxicity follows a decreasing trend in the smx degradation process in co2fe1 ldh paa system bioaccumulation factor is the indicator of the chemical concentration in fish as a result of absorption via the respiratory surface to that in water at a steady state the obtained bioaccumulation factor of smx and ten degradation products indicate that all compounds except tp 298 12 21 are lower than smx 11 42 fig 6 b in addition developmental toxicity whether or not a chemical causes developmental toxicity effects to humans or animals value of smx is higher than that in other degradation products fig 6 c proving a decrease of the degradation products toxicity after degradation to comprehensively evaluate the toxicity of smx and its degradation products to organisms the actual biotoxicity of this system was evaluated by luminous bacteria vibrio fischeri as detailed in text s10 as depicted in fig 6 d the inhibition ratio ir values of blank group 0 2 mm paa and 50 mg l co2fe1 ldh after and before reaction are slight and almost unchanged indicating weak inhibition on microorganisms in contrast after reaction the ir value of smx and its degradation products in co2fe1 ldh paa system is 0 146 which is significantly lower than that before reaction ir 0 331 combined with the above t e s t and actual biotoxicity analyzes alone paa and co2fe1 ldh have negligible inhibition effects on the environment after reaction the total actual toxicity of co2fe1 ldh paa smx reaction system is lower than before reaction certifying that co2fe1 ldh paa activation system can effectively reduce the biological toxicity of smx due to lower biotoxicity of degradation products and the carbon sources provided by paa solution yang et al 2022 3 5 actual hospital wastewater treatment to evaluate the practical application potential of co2fe1 ldh paa system in wastewater treatment firstly we evaluated the influence of anions such as hco3 hpo4 2 and cl and humic acid ha contained in the actual wastewater on contaminant degradation rate the introduction of water matrix inhibited the degradation rate of pollutants to a certain extent fig s25 especially for hco3 hpo4 2 and ha subsequently to explore the removal ability of target pollutants taking smx as the example in actual wastewater we selected hospital wastewater as the actual wastewater and the information of this sewage is shown in table s8 as seen in fig s26 about 69 6 of smx was removed when the paa concentration was 0 2 mm co2fe1 ldh 50 mg l smx 20 μm ph 6 4 t 25 c while more than 90 smx was eliminated in the hospital wastewater when the paa concentration was increased to 1 0 mm since other organics in hospital wastewater would compete with the target pollutant smx for paa causing paa to become a limiting factor for target pollutant removal and the target pollutant will be better removed when sufficient paa exists in the reaction solution notably the water quality parameters toc cod and bod of hospital wastewater were decreased and especially the b c ratio was increased to 0 636 from 0 332 after the treatment fig 7 a demonstrating that wastewater quality can be improved observably after treating in co2fe1 ldh paa system co2fe1 ldh 50 mg l paa 0 2 mm ph 6 4 t 25 c furthermore the removal of all organic substances in hospital wastewater was evaluated three dimensional excitation and emission matrix 3d eem and uv scanning based on the results of uv scanning fig 7 b the peaks in the range of 240 400 nm disappeared after the reaction compared with that before the reaction demonstrating the effective removal of pollutants in water this conclusion also can be supported by 3d eem analysis results fig 7 c d in which fluorescence intensity on both peak a and peak b changes from strong yellow indicates strong fluorescence intensity to weak green represents weak fluorescence intensity indicating that the corresponding organic matter was effectively degraded he et al 2020 he et al 2017 the above analysis indicates that co2fe1 ldh paa system can effectively remove the pollutants in the actual wastewater and improve the water quality of wastewater showing good potential in actual wastewater treatment 4 conclusion for the first time this study demonstrated that ldh containing both co and fe cofe ldh could efficiently activate paa for removing pharmaceuticals various pharmaceuticals such as smx smr siz nap and cbz can be removed with high degradation efficiencies compared to the single component cofe ldh containing both co and fe can obviously promote the electrochemical performance of the catalyst causing fe atoms to accelerate the conversion of co from 3 to 2 valence state with a high reaction rate 4 3 101 1 483 102 m 1 s 1 which is favorable to improve the activation ability of paa due to the higher catalytic activity of co2 in the activation process multiple ros oh r o and high valent metal species are involved and jointly participate in the degradation of contaminants while r o especially ch3c o oo with high concentration 5 27 10 13 m acts as the dominant ros in micropollutants degradation process ten transformation products tps of smx are detected in the removal process which is consistent with dft results that the active site in smx is c1 c3 c5 and n11 on aniline group and the chemical bond that is easy to break is s c and s n bonds both t e s t and luminous bacteria vibrio fischeri analyzes indicate that co2fe1 ldh paa activation system can effectively reduce the biological toxicity of smx due to lower biotoxicity of degradation products than smx itself additionally cofe ldh paa system has good removal ability on actual hospital wastewater however water matrix such as hco3 hpo4 2 and cl and humic acid ha contained in the actual wastewater has an inhibitory effect on the paa activation system as well as different anions have different effects on paa cl has a weak influence on pollutant removal while hco3 and hpo4 2 can significantly inhibit degradation therefore more efforts should be conducted to reduce the influence of water matrix on pollutant removal and deepen the study on water matrix influencing activity of ros like r o the new knowledge gained in this study helps apply ldh catalysts into paa based aops for environmental applications and provides new insights into bimetallic synergistic effects in paa activation systems declaration of competing

15026,as an oxidant peracetic acid paa is gradually applied in advanced oxidation processes aops for pollutants degradation due to its high oxidation and low toxicity in this study the prepared co2fe1 ldh showed excellent paa activation ability for efficient degradation of various pharmaceuticals with a removal efficiency ranging from 82 3 to 100 taking sulfamethoxazole smx as a model pharmaceutical it s found that organic radical r o with high concentration of 5 27 10 13 m is the dominant ros responsible for contaminants degradation further analysis demonstrated that bimetallic synergistic effect between co and fe can improve electron transfer ability of co2fe1 ldh resulting in the accelerated conversion of co from 3 to 2 valence state with a high reaction rate 4 3 101 1 483 102 m 1 s 1 in this system density functional theory dft reveals that c1 c3 c5 and n11 with higher ƒ0 and ƒ values concentrated on aniline group of smx are the main attack sites which is consistent with the results of degradation products besides co2fe1 ldh paa system can effectively reduce biological toxicity after reaction due to lower biotoxicity of degradation products and the carbon sources provided by paa in application co2fe1 ldh paa system was capable of resisting the influence of water matrix and effectively removing pollutants in actual hospital wastewater importantly this study

2018 yun et al 2017 wei et al 2022 li et al 2019 peracetic acid paa is an organic peroxyacid that has been widely used in wastewater disinfection owing to its high disinfection efficiency and low level of formation of harmful disinfection byproducts dbps koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 luukkonen et al 2015 in addition to disinfection paa as a strong oxidizing agent 1 96 v vs nhe can be used in aops for removing contaminants ao et al 2021 which is attracting greater interest in research and applications up to now a lot of strategies have been provided to activate paa for contaminants removal ao et al 2021 and metal based catalysts often have better catalytic ability than other catalysts several studies have investigated the feasibility of activating paa by transition metals containing homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts ao et al 2021 co ion fe ion ru ion and fes have been used to activate paa and showed efficient activation capability kim et al 2019 li et al 2021 wang et al 2020b yang et al 2022 while it is difficult to recycle homogeneous catalysts due to high metal dissolution despite other heterogeneous metal catalysts such as cobalt oxides wu et al 2020 cofe2o4 wang et al 2021a and mno2 rokhina et al 2010 have been applied to paa activation they are faced with the problems of high metal leaching and low activity therefore it is critical to develop and design catalysts with high catalytic activity low cost easy synthesis and recycling layered double hydroxides ldhs as a class of two dimensional layered anionic clays have been widely applied in aops to degrade contaminants in wastewater guo et al 2010 xie et al 2021 because of the following outstanding advantages i ldhs are easy to synthesize with low cost and can immobilize various metal ions to improve the catalytic performance ii their ph buffering ability is able to keep ph around neutral benefitting to the activation of paa iii the stable structure of ldh based catalyst can reduce the metal leaching and promote the reusability it has been proved that co and fe ions possessed high catalytic ability for paa activation kim et al 2019 wang et al 2020b thus ldh containing both co and fe may greatly increase catalytic activity the generated ros in cofe ldh paa may be abundant and different from that in co paa and fe paa systems and bimetallic synergic effect may arise in the process of cofe ldh activating paa unfortunately there is limited information on how cofe ldh activates paa for removing contaminants and whether bimetallic synergic effect occurs in the activation process hospital wastewater is a kind of wastewater with complex components such as pathogenic microorganisms pharmaceuticals and their metabolites antibiotics resistance genes and contrast agents azuma et al 2019 lien et al 2016 wallmann et al 2021 which can spread diseases and pollute the environment especially various pharmaceuticals remained in wastewater will seriously threaten the ecological environment and human health azuma et al 2019 lien et al 2016 pharmaceutical contaminants in hospital wastewater with various types strong biological toxicity and complex molecular structure which are difficult to be effectively removed by traditional biological treatment processes casas et al 2015 kovalova et al 2012 although aops have been used for pharmaceuticals degradation with high removal efficiency wang et al 2022 xia et al 2020 xie et al 2022 water matrix such as inorganic anions and dissolved organic matters in actual hospital wastewater will greatly affect degradation efficiency dong et al 2022 kovalova et al 2013 meanwhile in some aops reaction systems the biological toxicity of the system after reaction is higher than that before reaction dong et al 2022 rayaroth et al 2022 which is harmful to the environment or the following biological treatment system as an organic peroxyacid and a disinfectant paa can be used in aops to degrade pharmaceuticals with high efficiency and low toxicity ao et al 2021 da silva et al 2020 however most of the research only focuses on one pollutant such as smx ao et al 2021 wang et al 2020a and there is almost no relevant research on its application in actual hospital wastewater in this study a cost effective co2fe1 ldh was successfully synthesized and analyzed by various characterization methods various pharmaceuticals including antibiotics psychotropic drugs and pain relievers were selected to evaluate the ability of co2fe1 ldh activating paa the ros produced in the co2fe1 ldh paa was detected by quenching experiments probe compound tests and electron paramagnetic resonance epr furthermore the bimetallic synergistic activation effect of co2fe1 ldh was explored and verified by experiment and electrochemical characterization and at the same time the second order reaction rate constant of the synergistic reaction in this system was calculated density functional theory dft was applied to analyze the speculated active sites and easily broken chemical bonds of the typical contaminant whereafter the biotoxicity of smx and its degradation products were evaluated in co2fe1 ldh paa system finally this research also assessed the effects of water matrix on the degradation rate and more importantly explored the application of co2fe1 ldh paa system in actual hospital wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods the information of the selected chemicals and reagents and their sources is provided in the supporting information text s1 cofe ldh synthesis method experimental procedures characterizations and analytical methods are stated in texts s2 s5 respectively and the corresponding characterization results are illustrated in figs s1 s3 additionally the details of dft calculations and fukui function indexes are shown in text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 performances of pharmaceuticals degradation as stated in text s7 according to multiple characterization results the co2fe1 ldh was successfully synthesized in this work next to better evaluate the ability of co2fe1 ldh activating paa five pharmaceuticals classified as antibiotics psychotropic drugs and pain relievers including smx sulfisoxazole siz sulfamerazine smr naproxen nap and carbamazepine cbz were degraded in the same reaction conditions paa 0 2 mm co2fe1 ldh 50 mg l contaminant 20 μm ph 6 4 t 25 c and reaction time 30 min respectively as depicted in fig 1 a b the degradation efficiencies of smx smr siz nap and cbz were 95 3 kobs 0 118 min 1 82 3 kobs 0 067 min 1 99 5 kobs 0 282 min 1 100 kobs 0 307 min 1 and 89 7 kobs 0 085 min 1 respectively further experiments results indicated that the dominant removal way for these five contaminants is ros degradation rather than adsorption and direct oxidation of paa fig s4 additionally taking smx as an example more than 56 of toc was removed during the reaction text s5 and fig s5 in contrast to other common peroxyacid oxidants such as h2o2 and peroxydisulfate pds smx removal rate for paa 95 3 was distinctly higher than that in pds 19 4 and h2o2 9 7 system fig s6 the cost effectiveness ce analysis text s8 indicates that paa has a lower ce value in comparison with pds and h2o2 is hard to be activated by co2fe1 ldh above results demonstrated that paa as a peroxyacid oxidant is sensitive to be activated by co2fe1 ldh and has enormous potential in degrading pharmaceuticals the degradation performance of pollutants will be affected by reaction parameters such as proportion of metal ions co2fe1 ldh dosage paa concentration and initial ph of solution text s9 and can be maximized under optimal reaction conditions paa 0 2 mm co2fe1 ldh 50 mg l contaminant 20 μm ph 6 4 it is worth mentioning that the optimal reaction parameters are almost the same for other contaminants like siz fig s8 in addition co2fe1 ldh shows excellent stability and reusability figs s10 and s11 specifically co2fe1 ldh can control ions leaching in a lower range in each recycling process co 100 ppb and fe 10 ppb fig s12 and maintain the catalytic performance at a high level 78 6 95 3 of smx even after four cycles 3 2 ros evaluation as mentioned above the degradation of contaminants in co2fe1 ldh paa system was almost induced by ros oxidation h2o2 contained in paa solution has a weak impact on contaminants degradation fig s6 which may arise from the higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy elumo h2o2 0 69 ev elumo paa 0 26 ev and higher o oh bond energy paa 38 kcal mol 1 h2o2 52 kcal mol 1 table s3 which has the side effect on the activation of h2o2 thus paa is more susceptive to be activated by co2fe1 ldh and controls the generation of ros in the catalytic process subsequently to better explore the type of ros produced in this catalytic activation epr analysis quenching and chemical probes experiments were conducted in this part 3 2 1 quenching experiments firstly tert butanol tba is a well known oh scavenger at a high reaction rate constant of 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 but does not affect the carbon centered radicals r o such as acetyloxyl radical ch3co2 and acetylperoxy radical ch3co3 cai et al 2017 wang et al 2020b 2 4 hd can react rapidly with oh k 1 1010 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 and can also act as the scavenger for ch3c o o or ch3c o oo k 5 108 m 1 s 1 because 2 4 hd containing with cc bond that is easily attacked by acetyl per oxyl radicals chateauneuf et al 1988 kim et al 2020 on the basis of these rate constants 2 4 hd can scavenge both oh and r o additionally high valent metal species like fe iv and co iv can react with methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso or dimethyl sulfoxides dmso with a higher reaction rate constant about 105 106 m 1 s 1 than other quenching agents like k fe iv meoh 5 72 102 m 1 s 1 k fe iv etoh 2 51 103 m 1 s 1 and k fe iv tba 6 0 101 m 1 s 1 kim et al 2019 pestovsky and bakac 2004 2006 hence pmso is widely used as the scavenger of high valent metal species kim et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 liu et al 2021 accordingly tba 2 4 hd meoh and pmso were used in the next quenching experiments to identify ros produced in this system as a result taking smx as an example fig 2 a only about 6 3 of smx was inhibited when low 20 mm or high 200 mm concentration of tba was introduced into reaction solution indicating that oh played a minor role in removing contaminants afterward the degradation efficiency of smx decreased distinctly when low or high concentration of 2 4 hd 10 or 20 mm was added inferring that both oh and r o were involved in the process but r o acted as the dominant role additionally meoh as a commonly used quencher for reactive radicals can scavenge r o ch3c o o and ch3c o oo and other radicals in paa activation system ao et al 2021 obviously compared with tba and 2 4 hd 20 or 200 mm of meoh could significantly suppress the degradation of smx about 87 5 smx was suppressed when 200 mm meoh was added and the inhibiting effect was visibly higher than that in tba 6 3 and slightly higher than that in 2 4 hd 84 7 this phenomenon testifies that not only oh and r o but also other radicals such as ch3 and ho2 can be quenched by meoh while other radicals make a negligible contribution to the smx degradation finally when excess pmso 0 1 mm was introduced about 10 4 of smx was inhibited this result demonstrated that high valent metal species like fe iv and co iv served as a minor role in the degradation process of contaminants to further verify high valent metal species pmso2 conversion rate experiment was conducted the obtained conversion rate was only 5 7 fig s14 demonstrating that the amount of high valent metal species like co iv is very limited in addition furfuryl alcohol ffa and p benzoquinone p bq can be used to quench 1o2 and o2 respectively li et al 2022 as seen in figs s15 and s16 the degradation of smx is hardly inhibited demonstrating that almost no 1o2 and o2 are produced in co2fe1 ldh paa system it is worth noting that quenching agents pmso meoh tba p bq ffa and 2 4 hd used in the quenching experiment have weak effects on paa consumption fig s17 indicating that the inhibition of pollutant degradation is not caused by the complete consumption of paa by the quenching agents 3 2 2 epr experiments to further evaluate the ros generated in this system epr as the powerful evidence was conducted as seen in fig 2 b unexpectedly a strong signal of septet peaks attributed to dmpox 5 5 dimethyl 2 pyrrolidone n oxyl the oxidized form of dmpo wang and wang 2020 wang et al 2021b rather than direct oh or r o adducts were observed in co2fe1 ldh paa system whereafter some supplementary experiments were carried out to make clear what caused the formation of dmpox in co2fe1 ldh paa system there were no characteristic signal peaks when dmpo was added into h2o2 0 20 mm or paa 0 20 mm solution without co2fe1 ldh figs 2 b and s18 demonstrating that alone paa or h2o2 failed to result in the generation of dmpox additionally dmpox signal was also hardly obtained in co2fe1 ldh h2o2 process which could exclude the hypothesis that the generation of dmpox was induced by co2fe1 ldh and co2fe1 ldh h2o2 as shown in fig s19 typical three peaks representing temp 1o2 adducts were detected in paa solution while no signal was observed in co2fe1 ldh paa system this phenomenon can be explained by the attack of central c atom of paa by peroxy group wang et al 2020 and the rapid consumption of paa induced by co2fe1 ldh fig s17 above discussion indicated that the generated 1o2 came from the self decomposition of paa rather than the catalytic decomposition of paa induced by co2fe1 ldh based on the aforementioned discussion it can be deduced that the formation of dmpox is hardly caused by paa h2o2 co2fe1 ldh co2fe1 ldh h2o2 and 1o2 while high valence metal ions oh and r o may play roles in the oxidation of dmpo then as seen in fig 2 c when 10 mm 2 4 hd was introduced the disappeared dmpox indicated that oh and r o rather than high valence metal ions caused the generation of dmpox after adding 20 mm tba slightly decreased dmpox intensity revealed that r o rather than oh was the crucial role in causing the formation of dmpox to further confirm the existence of r o in co2fe1 ldh paa system dippmpo as a trapping agent has been used in paa activation system to detect carbon based radicals kim et al 2019 yang et al 2022 which is direct evidence for the existence of r o as shown in fig 2 d carbon centered radicals 12 line signal indicated by red dots appear in the system when the addition of dippmpo confirming the existence of r o combined with aforesaid results of quenching tests and epr high valence metal ions r o and oh were involved in this system but r o acted as the dominant role for contaminant removal in co2fe1 ldh paa system the corresponding calculated contribution ratios of different ros to contaminant degradation are as follows text s10 r o 82 27 high valence metal ions 10 94 oh 6 61 3 2 3 concentration of r o although ch3c o o and ch3c o oo are two critical r o species ch3c o oo is the main r o species and served as the major and most reactive radical for contaminants degradation kim et al 2020 kim et al 2019 wang et al 2020b to measure the steady state concentration of r o generated in this system relevant dynamic analysis models are applied because the removal of pollutants is ascribed to the oxidation of r o oh and other ros the degradation of pollutants can be expressed by eqs 1 7 and the average steady state concentration of oh and r o can be shown in eqs 8 and 9 besides after adding adequate 2 4 hd 20 mm the obtained kobs other is assigned to other ros because both r o and oh are almost completely consumed by 2 4 hd thus the kobs value of pollutants degradation jointly induced by r o and oh can be obtained by difference between kobs c and kobs other eqs 10 and 11 subsequently according to the kinetic formulas of smx and nap degradation oh ave and r o ave can be calculated by eqs 12 and 13 as seen in fig s20 the values of kobs smx kobs other and kobs nap kobs other are 0 0019 and 0 005 s 1 respectively finally based on the known data k smx oh 7 9 109 m 1 s 1 k smx r o 3 18 109 m 1 s 1 k nap oh 8 99 109 m 1 s 1 k nap r o 9 0 109 m 1 s 1 wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2015 the obtained oh ave and r o ave are 2 81 10 14 m and 5 27 10 13 m respectively eqs 14 17 demonstrating that r o is easier to generate and is the predominant ros in co2fe1 ldh paa system simultaneously the degradation results of ba probe compound of oh and nap prober of r o also demonstrate that a large number of r o exists in co2fe1 ldh paa system fig s21 1 d c d t k oh c c oh k r o c c ro k other c c other 2 ln c c 0 k oh c oh d t k r o c ro d t k other c other

other c are the second order reaction rate of oh r o and other ros with contaminants the kobs oh kobs r o and kobs other represent the apparent rate constant of oh r o and other ros furthermore oh ave and r o ave are the average steady state concentration of oh and r o respectively 3 3 bimetallic synergic effect and activation mechanism 3 3 1 bimetallic synergic effect as a bimetallic catalyst bimetallic synergy effect may exist in the process of paa activation but this phenomenon has not been explored so far in order to explore whether there is bimetallic synergistic effect in paa activation process induced by co2fe1 ldh various ldhs including co ldh fe ldh and co2fe1 ldh were used in the next degradation experiments compared with single metal ldhs co ldh 62 3 k 0 075 min 1 fe ldh 14 6 k 0 021 min 1 co2fe1 ldh shows better smx removal efficiency co2fe1 ldh 95 3 k 0 118 min 1 fig 3 a exhibiting obviously synergistic effects which can be explained by the following two aspects on the one hand for heterogeneous co2fe1 ldh catalyst the surface co and fe serves as the active sites to activate paa for removing pollutant based on the above xps results fig s1 e the changed ratio of divalent and trivalent metals such as co ii and co iii on the co2fe1 ldh surface indicated that there is a conversion of divalent and trivalent metals especially the content of co ii increased from 0 453 to 0 512 after reaction which may be caused by the conversion of co iii to co ii the electrochemical performance of catalyst can be reflected by tafel curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis he et al 2022 zhou et al 2021 as shown in fig 3 b c tafel plot displayed that the co2fe1 ldh has lower free corrosion potential 0 226 v and higher corrosion current 5 69 10 7 a than co ldh 0 187 v 2 25 10 8 a and fe ldh 0 214 v 2 48 10 7 a additionally as one of methods for evaluating the electron transfer ability the arc radius of eis spectra of co2fe1 ldh is smaller than other two materials illustrating the greater electron migration capacity of co2fe1 ldh the above results of tafel curve and eis both demonstrate that the synergy of co and fe makes co2fe1 ldh possess better electrochemical performance which is beneficial for better electron transfer promoting the conversion of divalent and trivalent metals on the other hand it is widely known that dissolved homogeneous metal ions such as co2 and fe3 can also participate in catalytic reactions similarly in co2fe1 ldh paa system the maximumly released co and fe ions co2 100 ppb and fe3 10 ppb were involved in the reaction process and they could jointly activate paa to remove about 21 4 smx fig 3 d however the heterogeneous surface co ii and fe iii could eliminate more than 74 1 smx in 30 min thus playing the dominant role in the degradation process as seen in fig 3 e when 2 mg l of fe2 was introduced into co2fe1 ldh paa system the obtained k obs was 0 126 min 1 which is higher than that of alone fe2 0 012 min 1 and co2fe1 ldh paa system 0 118 min 1 according to the standard reduction potentials of co and fe the reduction of co3 by fe2 is thermodynamically feasible hence it is supposed that fe2 can react with co3 to generate co2 in the reaction process causing higher smx removal ability because co2 has better paa activation ability than fe2 and fe3 ao et al 2021 additionally this inference the fe ii in co2fe1 ldh can promote the conversion of co iii to co ii can be further evidenced by the proportion of fe3 in fe2 paa co2fe1 ldh paa and fe2 co2fe1 ldh paa system respectively text s5 as depicted in fig 3 f in fe2 paa system fe2 2 mg l paa 0 2 mm the proportion of fe3 increases rapidly from 0 to 5 min and continues to increase to about 80 at 30 min due to rapid oxidation of dissolved fe2 by paa after acid digestion the total fe and fe3 contained in 50 mg l of co2fe1 ldh were 7 84 mg l and 2 32 mg l respectively in the co2fe1 ldh paa system the ratio of fe3 was increased from 32 5 at 0 min to 66 8 at 30 min showing that the content of fe3 was enhanced after reaction theoretically the calculated ratio of fe3 in fe2 co2fe1 ldh paa was about 69 4 after reaction at 30 min while the obtained ratio of fe3 was about 76 6 at 30 min which was distinctly higher than the theoretical calculation data 69 4 demonstrating that the appearance of fe2 may promote the system to generate more fe3 as discussed above the presence of co and fe is conducive to improving the electron transfer capability of the catalyst benefiting that fe ii promotes the conversion of co iii to co ii eq 18 accordingly the reaction rate of eq 18 is measured in this study text s11 and figs s22 and s23 the obtained kobs of eq 18 is 0 256 min 1 and the corresponding second order reaction rate constant in this paa activation system is about 4 3 101 m 1 s 1 to1 483 102 m 1 s 1 18 fe ii co iii co ii fe iii 3 3 1 activation mechanism in co2fe1 ldh paa system based on the above analysis compared with fe co played a more critical role in paa activation in co2fe1 ldh paa system and both homogeneous minor pathway and heterogeneous major pathway reactions were involved in the degradation process meanwhile the bimetallic synergy is firstly observed in the paa activation process which can promote the electrochemical performance and accelerate the reduction of trivalent metals especially trivalent co to speed up the paa activation and following ros generation the main reactions in the system are inferred as follows in co2fe1 ldh paa system co ii can activate paa ch3co3h to generate co iii and ch3c o o eq 19 then co iii can react with paa to produce co ii and ch3c o oo eq 20 fe ii is oxidized by paa with formation of ch3c o o and ch3c o o and oh respectively eqs 21 23 besides fe ii can also be oxidized by paa to generate fe iv eq 24 in addition to paa fe ii fe iii can also react with h2o2 to form oh fe iv and other weak radicals like ho 2 eqs 25 27 the fe ii can promote the conversion of co iii to co ii eq 28 additionally ch3c o o can be quickly consumed by reacting with paa itself and self decomposition eqs 29 31 causing a weak effect of ch3c o o on contaminants degradation the generated oh can react with paa to form ch3c o oo with high reaction rate 9 33 0 3 108 m 1 s 1 eq 32 the main reaction mechanism in this system is shown in fig 4 and the corresponding second order reaction rates of these reactions eqs 19 32 are listed in the table s4 19 co ii c h 3 c o 3 h co iii c h 3 c o o o h 20 co iii c h 3 c o 3 h co ii c h 3 c o oo h 21 fe ii c h 3 c o 3 h fe iii c h 3 c

important indicator can be used to evaluate the reactive sites on contaminants theoretically the sites with high ƒ0 and ƒ values are vulnerable to be attacked by radical and electrophilic species respectively guo et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 firstly the optimized molecular structure of smx is shown in fig 5 a the corresponding fukui values of smx detailed in fig 5 b indicate that the atoms with high ƒ0 and ƒ values are c1 c3 c5 n11 c2 c4 c6 h12 and h13 table s5 furthermore most of atoms such as c1 c3 c5 and n11 with higher ƒ0 and ƒ values are concentrated on the aniline group showing the main attack site on sas is aniline rather than heterocyclic substituents as described in fig 5 c according to the theoretical calculation results it is inferred that the active site in the smx structure that is easy to be attacked is c1 c3 c5 and n11 on aniline group of smx and s c and s n bonds is easy to break transformation products tps of smx in the co2fe1 ldh paa system were analyzed by using uhplc qtof ms the corresponding ms and ms ms of smx were shown in fig s24 and 10 main tps with detailed information were listed in table s6 it is deduced that smx can be attacked by four main pathways in co2fe1 ldh paa system fig 5 d tp 284 is the hydroxylation product of smx pathway a which is caused by the attack of oh r o on the ortho position c3 and c5 of the amino group due to the electron donating characteristic of nh2 and electron withdrawing characteristic of so2 nh the amino n atom on smx can be attacked by radicals via one electron transfer forming n centered radicals which can react with smx itself and then form dimeric products tp 503 pathway d meanwhile due to the electron donating characteristic and higher values of f0 0 1208 and f 0 1837 of n nh2 on the aniline is sensitive to be attacked by electrophilic radicals oh r o through electron transfer mechanism forming n centered radicals which might be further oxidized to nitro substituted products tp 270 tp 282 and tp 298 pathway b besides the cleavage of s n bond and c s bond of smx occurs with the detection of some fragments tp 99 tp 158 and tp 94 pathway c which is consistent with the above theoretical calculation results fig 5 c tp 192 containing cooh may be attributed to the attack of r o like ch3c o oo on tp 176 which can indirectly prove the reaction of smx and r o the above products can be further oxidized by ros into smaller products and finally converted into co2 and h2o 3 4 2 toxicity analysis in order to assess the biological toxicity effects of smx and corresponding degradation products on the environment and organisms the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar approach was applied lai et al 2021 acute toxicity oral rat ld50 bioaccumulation factor and developmental toxicity of smx and ten intermediates were calculated using toxicity estimation software tool t e s t us epa details about the analytical methods are presented in text s12 and the obtained date is listed in table s7 as shown in fig 6 a the oral rat d50 of smx is 6203 72 mg kg which is higher than its degradation products demonstrating that the toxicity follows a decreasing trend in the smx degradation process in co2fe1 ldh paa system bioaccumulation factor is the indicator of the chemical concentration in fish as a result of absorption via the respiratory surface to that in water at a steady state the obtained bioaccumulation factor of smx and ten degradation products indicate that all compounds except tp 298 12 21 are lower than smx 11 42 fig 6 b in addition developmental toxicity whether or not a chemical causes developmental toxicity effects to humans or animals value of smx is higher than that in other degradation products fig 6 c proving a decrease of the degradation products toxicity after degradation to comprehensively evaluate the toxicity of smx and its degradation products to organisms the actual biotoxicity of this system was evaluated by luminous bacteria vibrio fischeri as detailed in text s10 as depicted in fig 6 d the inhibition ratio ir values of blank group 0 2 mm paa and 50 mg l co2fe1 ldh after and before reaction are slight and almost unchanged indicating weak inhibition on microorganisms in contrast after reaction the ir value of smx and its degradation products in co2fe1 ldh paa system is 0 146 which is significantly lower than that before reaction ir 0 331 combined with the above t e s t and actual biotoxicity analyzes alone paa and co2fe1 ldh have negligible inhibition effects on the environment after reaction the total actual toxicity of co2fe1 ldh paa smx reaction system is lower than before reaction certifying that co2fe1 ldh paa activation system can effectively reduce the biological toxicity of smx due to lower biotoxicity of degradation products and the carbon sources provided by paa solution yang et al 2022 3 5 actual hospital wastewater treatment to evaluate the practical application potential of co2fe1 ldh paa system in wastewater treatment firstly we evaluated the influence of anions such as hco3 hpo4 2 and cl and humic acid ha contained in the actual wastewater on contaminant degradation rate the introduction of water matrix inhibited the degradation rate of pollutants to a certain extent fig s25 especially for hco3 hpo4 2 and ha subsequently to explore the removal ability of target pollutants taking smx as the example in actual wastewater we selected hospital wastewater as the actual wastewater and the information of this sewage is shown in table s8 as seen in fig s26 about 69 6 of smx was removed when the paa concentration was 0 2 mm co2fe1 ldh 50 mg l smx 20 μm ph 6 4 t 25 c while more than 90 smx was eliminated in the hospital wastewater when the paa concentration was increased to 1 0 mm since other organics in hospital wastewater would compete with the target pollutant smx for paa causing paa to become a limiting factor for target pollutant removal and the target pollutant will be better removed when sufficient paa exists in the reaction solution notably the water quality parameters toc cod and bod of hospital wastewater were decreased and especially the b c ratio was increased to 0 636 from 0 332 after the treatment fig 7 a demonstrating that wastewater quality can be improved observably after treating in co2fe1 ldh paa system co2fe1 ldh 50 mg l paa 0 2 mm ph 6 4 t 25 c furthermore the removal of all organic substances in hospital wastewater was evaluated three dimensional excitation and emission matrix 3d eem and uv scanning based on the results of uv scanning fig 7 b the peaks in the range of 240 400 nm disappeared after the reaction compared with that before the reaction demonstrating the effective removal of pollutants in water this conclusion also can be supported by 3d eem analysis results fig 7 c d in which fluorescence intensity on both peak a and peak b changes from strong yellow indicates strong fluorescence intensity to weak green represents weak fluorescence intensity indicating that the corresponding organic matter was effectively degraded he et al 2020 he et al 2017 the above analysis indicates that co2fe1 ldh paa system can effectively remove the pollutants in the actual wastewater and improve the water quality of wastewater showing good potential in actual wastewater treatment 4 conclusion for the first time this study demonstrated that ldh containing both co and fe cofe ldh could efficiently activate paa for removing pharmaceuticals various pharmaceuticals such as smx smr siz nap and cbz can be removed with high degradation efficiencies compared to the single component cofe ldh containing both co and fe can obviously promote the electrochemical performance of the catalyst causing fe atoms to accelerate the conversion of co from 3 to 2 valence state with a high reaction rate 4 3 101 1 483 102 m 1 s 1 which is favorable to improve the activation ability of paa due to the higher catalytic activity of co2 in the activation process multiple ros oh r o and high valent metal species are involved and jointly participate in the degradation of contaminants while r o especially ch3c o oo with high concentration 5 27 10 13 m acts as the dominant ros in micropollutants degradation process ten transformation products tps of smx are detected in the removal process which is consistent with dft results that the active site in smx is c1 c3 c5 and n11 on aniline group and the chemical bond that is easy to break is s c and s n bonds both t e s t and luminous bacteria vibrio fischeri analyzes indicate that co2fe1 ldh paa activation system can effectively reduce the biological toxicity of smx due to lower biotoxicity of degradation products than smx itself additionally cofe ldh paa system has good removal ability on actual hospital wastewater however water matrix such as hco3 hpo4 2 and cl and humic acid ha contained in the actual wastewater has an inhibitory effect on the paa activation system as well as different anions have different effects on paa cl has a weak influence on pollutant removal while hco3 and hpo4 2 can significantly inhibit degradation therefore more efforts should be conducted to reduce the influence of water matrix on pollutant removal and deepen the study on water matrix influencing activity of ros like r o the new knowledge gained in this study helps apply ldh catalysts into paa based aops for environmental applications and provides new insights into bimetallic synergistic effects in paa activation systems declaration of competing

analysis and theoretical calculation the degradation of fqs mainly occurred at the piperazine ring and quinolone structure our results show that fqs could be efficiently removed by fes which benefits understanding the transformation of antibiotics in the sediments and even sheds light on the remediation of organic pollutants contaminated soils graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fluoroquinolone antibiotics hydroxyl radical superoxide radical anions theoretical calculation environmental remediation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fluoroquinolone antibiotics fqs are a typical class of antibiotics with excellent broad spectrum antibacterial properties which have been widely applied to treat human infectious diseases and protect the growth of livestock and aquatic products due to the vast production and consumption fqs inevitably enter the natural environment as evidenced by their widespread detection in water and sediment adachi et al 2013 he et al 2012 sonne et al 2022 it was reported that fqs could be detected in 80 of total samples collected from seawater alygizakis et al 2016 moreover the detection of fqs e g ciprofloxacin cip and enrofloxacin enr were also reported for sampled river water and groundwater with concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 570 ng l 1 adachi et al 2013 lópez serna et al 2013 considering the frequent and high throughput of mass and energy exchanges fqs were able to translocate from water to sediment in which fqs concentrations could reach 50 µg kg 1 he et al 2012 sturini et al 2012 notably the widespread distribution of fqs exhibited great potential to raise the antibiotic resistance of microbes in sediments li et al 2022 schaeffer and wijntjes 2022 van doorslaer et al 2014 thus leading to risks to environment and human health bai et al 2014 kang et al 2001 riaz et al 2018 rubinstein 2001 xu et al 2022 in sediments fqs would undergo translocation and transformation which could significantly change the environmental behaviors and risks of these pharmaceuticals zhu et al 2022 due to the characteristic molecular structure and functional group fqs would be adsorbed by organic matters and minerals via complexation hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces córdova kreylos and scow 2007 nowara et al 1997 for instance cip could be adsorbed by hydrated aluminum oxides and hydrated iron oxides via forming monodentate and bidentate coordination with mineral surface respectively gu and karthikeyan 2005 in addition to adsorption fqs could be degraded via mineral induced redox reactions it was reported that δ mno2 was able to complex with the piperazine ring which could further induce electron transfer and fqs degradation zhang and huang 2005 zhang and huang 2007 also found that goethite was not only able to adsorb fqs efficiently but also to obtain significant degradation for six selected fqs moreover efficient decomposition of fqs was also observed for iron containing minerals which underwent selective removal of adsorbed fqs via surface fenton like reactions yan et al 2016 as a major component of sediment mineral he et al 2020 mackinawite fes could be formed via biological reduction processes cheng et al 2020 2016 as reported in previously published literatures fes could act as an efficient adsorbent and reductive reagent for chlorinated organic compounds e g hexachloroethane trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene butler and hayes 1998 1999 in addition to reductive capability fes could activate dioxygen o2 via electron transition with the production of highly oxidative species e g hydroxyl radical oh thus showing strong oxidation potential when the circumstances shifted from anaerobic to aerobic condition induced by mechanical disturbances e g bioturbation heavy rainfall groundwater recharge dredging of water bodies and mining he et al 2020 therefore it is reasonable to speculate that fes might affect the transformation of fqs in the sediment as the amount of dissolved oxygen do increased however limited information could be available on the mechanistic insights into the transformation of fqs induced by fes in the sediments the objectives of this study are i to investigate the degradation of fqs in the presence of fes under ambient conditions ii to evaluate the role of do in promoting fqs removal iii to identify the key reactive oxygen species ros responsible for fqs decomposition iv to get mechanistic insights into surface catalytic oxidation of fqs on fes our experimental results provided solid evidence for the enhanced degradation of fqs induced by fes which would benefit our understanding for the transformation of antibiotics in the sediments and even shed light on remediation of soil that was contaminated by organic pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals ferrous chloride tetrahydrate fecl2 4h2o perchloric acid hclo4 citric acid and potassium iodide ki

centrifugation and washing were conducted in an anaerobic chamber yqx ii shanghai hengzhi instruments which was covered with tin foil to avoid light irradiation and minimize the oxidation of fes 2 3

ml reaction solution was sampled and directly filtered through a 0 45 μm polytetrafloroethylene ptfe membrane for subsequent determination of solution fqs concentration the results of preliminary experiments indicated that the recovery of fqs treated with quenching solution could reach 95 fig s1 all degradation experiments were carried out in triplicate parallels 2 5 quantification of fqs

spectrometer cary 50 agilent usa monitoring at 562 nm the transformation products of s species e g so3 2 and so4 2 in the system were analyzed by an ion chromatograph ics 900 diane corporation usa

degradation in the presence of 0 05 g l 1 fes and 10 μm enr at ph 7 0 tba ki nbt and cat were used to quench oh surface oh o2 and h2o2 respectively wang et al 2020 xie et al 2019 moreover bpy was used to confirm whether the oxidation of fqs occurred on the fes surfaces since the complexation between fe ii and bpy could efficiently inhibit fe ii binding with fqs and reduce the electron donating ability of fe ii cheng et al 2020 2016 sun et al 2020 2 8 quantitative analysis of oh and o2 to quantify oh ba was used as a probe molecule joo et al 2005 the concentration of cumulated oh was

the concentration of p ohba respectively 2 c o h c u m c p o h b a 5 87 the concentration of generated o2 was measured by xtt method fu et al 2016 as reported xtt could react with o2 to form xtt

absorbance coefficient of xtt formazan and its value is 23 800 m 1 cm 1 fu et al 2016 l cm is the thickness of the absorption layer which is 1 cm in this study 2 000 000 is the conversion factor of the concentration 2 9 factors affecting the degradation of fqs by fes the effects of ph level natural organic matters nom and fes dosage were evaluated for the degradation of fqs and enr was selected to serve as the representative fq to perform degradation assays to explore the effect of ph on fq degradation 5 mm acetic acid sodium acetate buffer 5 mm mops buffer and 5 mm ches buffer were applied to control reaction ph at 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 respectively to study the effect of nom on enr degradation the initial concentration of nom was 0 50 and 100 mg l 1 respectively moreover fes concentrations ranging from 0 02 to 5 0 g l 1 were used to conduct the degradation kinetics experiments so as to investigate the effect of fes dosage on fq removal 2 10 theoretical calculations gaussian 09 w program frisch et al 2009 with density function theory dft method b3lyp becke 1993 was used to optimize the geometrical structures of fqs the 6 311 g d p basis set was applied to all atoms of fqs i e c h o n and f the truhlar s smd solvation model was used to take account the effect of solvent fang et al 2012 on the basis of optimized geometries frontier molecular orbitals i e the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo and the frontier electron densities feds were determined the values of 2fed2 homo and fed2 homo fed2 lumo were calculated for each atom except hydrogen to provide more precise prediction for reaction sites and elucidate the underlying degradation mechanism of fqs induced by fes oxidation 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of fqs by fes under ambient conditions as shown in fig 1a flu enr and cip could be efficiently degraded by fes suspension under ambient conditions with respective removal ratios of 79 8 87 7 and 81 5 within 240 min after fitting with pseudo first order kinetics model the k obs values were calculated as 51 6 10 3 34 0 10 3 and 25 4 10 3 min 1 for fes induced degradation of flu enr and cip respectively as shown in fig 1b after reacting for 10 min only 1 1 of enr and cip existed in the aqueous solution suggesting that residual enr and cip were almost totally adsorbed on fes surfaces for flu the residual amounts of total and aqueous fq accounted for 55 3 and 36 6 of the initial concentration indicating that the amount of flu adsorbed on fes surface after 10 min reaction accounted for 18 7 of the initial total fq as the reaction continued from 10 min to 240 min the concentrations of aqueous enr and cip gradually increased and reached plateau concentrations of 1 0 and 0 7 µm respectively therefore in addition to adsorbing fqs fes exhibited great potential to achieve efficient decomposition of fqs via self oxidation as shown in fig 1c enr could be efficiently degraded by fes at low concentrations 0 02 0 2 g l 1 within 240 min the k obs value was increased from 15 6 10 3 to 21 0 10 3 min 1 with concentration of fes increased from 0 02 to 0 2 g l 1 fig s2 however the degradation efficiency of enr decreased with further increasing the concentration of fes fig 1d and s2 as shown in fig 1d the removal rate of enr decreased from 90 to 41 1 at 240 min with fes concentration increased from 0 2 to 5 0 g l 1 as shown in fig s3 the concentrations of do decreased from 10 to 5 3 2 4 1 9 and 0 7 mg l 1 within 15 min in the presence of 0 05 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 g l 1 fes respectively do was rapidly consumed by fes at the initial reaction stage and then recovered gradually the recovery rate of do was negative to the fes concentration indicating that higher concentration of fes consumed more do the insufficient content of do might cause inhibition on enr degradation by excess fes 3 2 identification of key reactive species responsible for the removal of fqs epr experiments were conducted to explore the reactive species formed in fes suspension as shown in fig 2a a signal including four peaks with the intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 was observed in the presence of 1 10 3 and 5 10 3 g l 1 fes moreover the hyperfine splitting constant was fitted as α n α h 14 9 g suggesting the formation of dmpo oh adduct as a result oh could be produced in the fes suspension under ambient conditions moreover quenching experiments were conducted to identify reactive species that contributed to fes induced degradation of fqs as shown in fig 2b the k obs value of enr decreased by 19 7 56 5 and 14 4 in the presence of tba ki and cat respectively interestingly as an efficient quenching reagent for oh tba only exhibited a slight inhibition for the enr decomposition however the addition of ki could significantly lower the k obs of enr degradation from 34 0 10 3 to 14 8 10 3 min 1 suggesting that the oh generated on fes surfaces might play a dominant role in promoting enr degradation the inhibitory effects of cat on the degradation of enr indicated the generation of h2o2 which promoted the removal of fqs by generating oh via fenton like reaction it has been well recognized that the formation of h2o2 was commonly derived from the precursor substance o2 cheng et al 2016 in the reaction system o2 was produced as evidenced by the nbt induced inhibition for fq degradation despite negligible signals of o2 were monitored in the epr spectra possibly due to its extreme instability in aqueous environment wang et al 2020 it was reported that f could form chelate complex with fe iii on minerals surface hassani et al 2018 while negligible effects was obtained for fq removal when adding f into the reaction system indicating that fe iii would not act as the dominant reaction sites by comparison enr degradation was obviously inhibited in the presence of bpy and the fitted k obs value decreased from 34 0 10 3 to 3 7 10 3 min 1 since bpy exhibited great potential to form chelate complex with fe ii in the system cheng et al 2016 which would compete the adsorption sites with enr and subsequently inhibit the oxidation of fe ii therefore fes mineral surface oh and fe ii were served as the dominant oxidant and reaction site respectively which played an important role in promoting the degradation of fqs by sediment fes under ambient conditions furthermore the concentrations of oh and o2 were quantified by ba and xtt respectively as shown in fig 2c the cumulated concentration of oh increased gradually during fes oxidation and reached 1 7 and 10 1 μm within 240 min in the presence of 0 05 and 0 5 g l 1 fes respectively however more oh was generated in the presence of higher concentrations of fes but decreased enr removal rate was observed fig s2 fes is a reductant which could compete with enr for oh the rate constant of fe ii and oh is reported as 5 108 m 1s 1 cheng et al 2020 which indicated that high concentrations of fe ii could result in decreased utilization efficiency of oh by enr as shown in fig 2d the cumulated concentrations of xtt formazan were 19 1 12 2 8 4 and 5 7 μm at 240 min in the presence of 0 05 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 g l 1 fes respectively xtt formazan formation was negatively correlated with the concentration of fes possibly attributing to the limited do concentration fig s3 3 3 characterization of mackinawite minerals before and after reactions as shown in fig 3a six main characteristic absorption peaks of synthesized fes were observed and located at 2θ values of 17 6 30 1 39 0 50 4 53 0 and 59 1 which could be assigned to the 001 101 111 112 201 and 211 facets of mackinawite cheng et al 2020 during oxidation process the color of fes suspension clearly changed from black to brownish yellow moreover the peaks with 2θ values of 23 1 25 9 26 8 27 8 and 28 7 appeared in the xrd spectrum of oxidized fes which respectively referred to 222 026 311 040 and 313 lattice planes of elemental sulfur after removing elemental sulfur by washing with cyclohexane characteristic peaks located at 14 1 27 1 36 3 46 9 52 8 and 60 7 were obtained which could be assigned to the 020 120 031 200 151 and 231 facets of lepidocrocite moreover the xrd spectra of fes after reacting for specific time intervals were also analyzed as illustrated in fig s4 the signal intensity of fes underwent a gradual decrease as the reaction continued while an increase in the signal intensity was obtained for both lepidocrocite and elemental sulfur therefore the degradation of fqs by fes under ambient conditions was accompanied with the formation of elemental sulfur and lepidocrocite as shown in fig 3b the morphology of pristine fes was amorphous and poorly crystalline lamellar mineral crystals of 0 5 μm in length were observed on the surface of oxidized fes which could be recognized as the newly formed lepidocrocite according to the xrd results fig 3a and previously published literature an et al 2017 after reacting for 60 min spindle shaped structures appeared on the mineral surface which might be attributed to the microstructure of elemental sulfur furthermore the elemental analysis was conducted to get deep insights into the transformation mechanism of fes as shown in fig 3c fe 2p peaks of pristine fes could be divided into peaks located at 707 708 4 and 711 3 ev which could be assigned to fe ii s fe iii s and fe iii o respectively jeong et al 2010 fe ii s and fe iii s were the main species of fes during the reactions of fes fe ii s could transform into the forms of fe iii s and fe iii o moreover as reaction continued a dramatic decrease from 30 4 to 3 7 was obtained for the content of fe ii s after reacting for 60 min while the content of fe iii o increased up to 50 0 this suggested that fe ii was oxidized to fe iii on fes surface while s was replaced by o during the oxidation process as shown in fig 3d s 2p peaks of pristine fes could be divided into s2 s2 2 sn 2 and elemental sulfur with peaks located at 161 4 162 3 163 0 and 164 5 ev respectively du et al 2016 wei et al 2019 as the reaction proceeded sulfite and sulfate with peaks of 168 0 ev were observed while sulfur ions disappeared during the oxidation of fes s2 underwent gradual polymerization and oxidation through the process of s2 s2 2 sn 2 s8 jeong et al 2010 as shown in fig s5 o 1 s peaks of pristine fes was divided into two main peaks of 529 7 and 531 3 ev which referred to o2 and o h respectively jeong et al 2010 a significant increase in the o content was confirmed by the strengthened o 1 s signal intensity with the increasing reaction time which was consistent with the formation of fe oxides and fe hydroxides on the mineral surface jeong et al 2010 the changes of fe species were further analyzed to explore the transformation mechanism of fes as shown in fig s6a the concentration of total fe ii were 0 6 2 5 4 7 and 8 4 mm in the presence of 0 05 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 g l 1 fes respectively the concentration of fe ii decreased as the reaction proceeded the transformation products of s species during 0 05 g l 1 fes oxidation were also analyzed and products of sulfite and sulfate were detected fig s6b the concentration of sulfite and sulfate reached 0 06 and 0 04 μm within 240 min respectively 3 4 impact of ph and nom on the removal of fqs by fes since ph significantly affects the surface charge of minerals and existing forms of enr molecules the influence of solution ph on enr degradation by fes was investigated as shown in fig 4a the removal rate of enr increased first and then decreased as ph rose from 5 0 to 9 0 in addition ph greatly affected the content of enr in aqueous solution as the aqueous concentration of enr was the lowest at ph 7 0 during the degradation process fig s7 considering that 88 7 of enr was in the protonated form at ph 5 0 fig s8a and minerals surface was negatively charged fig s8b more enr should be adsorbed by fes minerals however more enr was released into aqueous solution with the oxidation of fes at ph 5 0 which might be attributed to the decreased surface reactive sites due to the dissolution of fes at low ph conditions 95 of enr was in the deprotonated form at ph 9 0 fig s8a which might inhibit its adsorption onto fes surfaces as shown in fig 4b enr removal rate decreased from 83 0 to 53 8 and 44 8 within 240 min in the presence of 50 and 100 mg l 1 nom respectively the corresponding k obs decreased to 8 7 10 3 and 8 1 10 3 min 1 these results indicated that nom played an inhibitory role in enr degradation by fes under ambient conditions which might be attributed to the competition between nom and enr for the adsorption sites and surface ros on fes mineral surfaces chen et al 2023 tétrault and gélinas 2022 3 5 identification of degradation products and reaction pathway elucidation to explore the degradation pathway of enr hplc qtof ms was used to identify the degradation products of enr as shown in figs 5 and s9 ten products were detected and identified two aromatic tertiary amines in piperazine ring has been reported to be easily attacked and oxidized feng et al 2018 n containing lone pairs of electrons in piperazine ring was firstly attacked by ros forming n structure since the electronegativity of n is stronger than carbon atoms the n was more likely to take electrons from the adjacent carbon atoms forming c structure an et al 2010 once c structure generated at the ethyl side chain of piperazine ring oh and h2o with lone pairs of electrons could attack the c leading to the breakaway of the ethyl side chain and produce product p9 when the c structure generated in the piperazine ring hydroxylated α c may be formed via h2o attacking when electrons of the n further attacked by ros and transferred to the α c c o group could be formed an et al 2010 as indicated by the production of p1 and p2 the c structure could also react with o2 to form peroxy radicals which could be further transformed to c c group generating product p3 an et al 2010 hydrolysis of product p3 could form hydroxylated α c adjacent to a n atom in piperazine ring which could be further oxidized to c o group by ros cleavage of c c group in piperazine ring of product p3 could be further oxidized by ros forming product p4 product p4 could be transformed to products p5 p6 and p7 via decarbonylation product p7 then underwent similar oxidation process similar to the formation of p3 and formed an enamine structure which could be further oxidized into a new product p8 finally the piperazine ring of enr was completely split and substituted with an amino group quinolone part of enr could also be oxidized by ros ros could electrophilically attack the c c group adjacent to the carboxyl group forming c structure at α c position of carboxyl group which could be rapidly attacked to form enol structure product p10 based on degradation products analysis the main degradation sites of enr were in the piperazine ring and quinolone part the above proposed reaction sites and degradation pathways were also supported by the results of theoretical calculations fig s10 the black numbers represent the values of 2fed2 homo and blue numbers represent the values of fed2 homo fed2 lumo it was reported that the atom of higher 2fed2 homo value tends to donate electrons and undergoes electrophilic reactions while the atom of higher fed2 homo fed2 lumo value is more likely to undergo radical reactions an et al 2010 the atom of the highest 2fed2 homo value 1 0289 was located at 22 n in piperazine ring of enr molecule fig s10a in addition the 2fed2 homo values of c atoms in piperazine ring were also higher than other c atoms in enr molecule these results indicated that piperazine ring in enr molecule is more likely to lose electrons to produce products p1 p3 and p9 when attacked by ros fig 5 the atom of the highest fed2 homo fed2 lumo value was 22 n 0 5149 followed by 8c 0 4825 and 7 n 0 1421 in enr molecule these results implied that the n atom in piperazine ring and c and n in quinolone part were more easily attacked in radical reactions which could form the products of p3 and p10 fig 5 as for cip molecule the atom of the highest 2fed2 homo value was located at 18 n 0 6043 in piperazine ring fig s10b while the atom of the highest fed2 homo fed2 lumo value was at 8c 0 4905 in quinolone part as for molecule without piperazine ring the atom of the highest 2fed2 homo value was located at 7 n 0 3245 in quinolone part in flu molecule fig s10c the above results indicated that piperazine ping and quinolone part of fqs structure tend to be attacked by ros 3 6 proposed mechanism for the degradation of fqs by fes based on above results we proposed the mechanism of fqs degradation by fes under ambient conditions as shown in fig 6 fqs existing in the form of zwitterionic species in the aqueous solution could be adsorbed on the surface of negatively charged fes by electrostatic attraction and the coordination of carboxyl groups with fe ii o2 could be generated from do reacting with fe ii which could attack fqs directly in addition o2 could be further converted into h2o2 which could react with fe ii to rapidly produce oh and subsequently degrade fqs the piperazine ring and the quinolone part were the main degradation sites of fqs which underwent ring opening reactions by free radicals and electrophilic attack during the fqs degradation process fes particle size became larger fig s11 and the content of surface oxygen increased fe ii in the fes finally transformed into the form of lepidocrocite accompanied with the formation of elemental sulfur 4 conclusions fqs have been widely used and inevitably released into the sediment environments which induced the generation of resistance genes and caused threats to human health in this study typical fqs i e flu enr and cip transformation in the presence of fes under ambient conditions were investigated our results showed that fes could efficiently adsorb and degrade fqs under ambient conditions do participated and played an essential role in fqs degradation by fes reactive oxygen species including o2 and surface oh were generated during fes oxidation which were responsible for fqs degradation the degradation of fqs mainly occurred at the piperazine ring and quinolone structure

understanding the transformation of antibiotics in the sediments and even sheds light on the remediation of organic pollutants contaminated soils graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords fluoroquinolone antibiotics hydroxyl radical superoxide radical anions theoretical calculation environmental remediation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fluoroquinolone antibiotics fqs are a typical class of antibiotics with excellent broad spectrum antibacterial properties which have been widely applied to treat human infectious diseases and protect the growth of livestock and aquatic products due to the vast production and consumption fqs inevitably enter the natural environment as evidenced by their widespread detection in water and sediment adachi et al 2013 he et al 2012 sonne et al 2022 it was reported that fqs could be detected in 80 of total samples collected from seawater alygizakis et al 2016 moreover the detection of fqs e g ciprofloxacin cip and enrofloxacin enr were also reported for sampled river water and groundwater with concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 570 ng l 1 adachi et al 2013 lópez serna et al 2013 considering the frequent and high throughput of mass and energy exchanges fqs were able to translocate from water to sediment in which fqs concentrations could reach 50 µg kg 1 he et al 2012 sturini et al 2012 notably the widespread distribution of fqs exhibited great potential to raise the antibiotic resistance of microbes in sediments li et al 2022 schaeffer and wijntjes 2022 van doorslaer et al 2014 thus leading to risks to environment and human health bai et al 2014 kang et al 2001 riaz et al 2018 rubinstein 2001 xu et al 2022 in sediments fqs would undergo translocation and transformation which could significantly change the environmental behaviors and risks of these pharmaceuticals zhu et al 2022 due to the characteristic molecular structure and functional group fqs would be adsorbed by organic matters and minerals via complexation hydrogen bonding and van der waals forces córdova kreylos and scow 2007 nowara et al 1997 for instance cip could be adsorbed by hydrated aluminum oxides and hydrated iron oxides via forming monodentate and bidentate coordination with mineral surface respectively gu and karthikeyan 2005 in addition to adsorption fqs could be degraded via mineral induced redox reactions it was reported that δ mno2 was able to complex with the piperazine ring which could further induce electron transfer and fqs degradation zhang and huang 2005 zhang and huang 2007 also found that goethite was not only able to adsorb fqs efficiently but also to obtain significant degradation for six selected fqs moreover efficient decomposition of fqs was also observed for iron containing minerals which underwent selective removal of adsorbed fqs via surface fenton like reactions yan et al 2016 as a major component of sediment mineral he et al 2020 mackinawite fes could be formed via biological reduction processes cheng et al 2020 2016 as reported in previously published literatures fes could act as an efficient adsorbent and reductive reagent for chlorinated organic compounds e g hexachloroethane trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene butler and hayes 1998 1999 in addition to reductive capability fes could activate dioxygen o2 via electron transition with the production of highly oxidative species e g hydroxyl radical oh thus showing strong oxidation potential when the circumstances shifted from anaerobic to aerobic condition induced by mechanical disturbances e g bioturbation heavy rainfall groundwater recharge dredging of water bodies and mining he et al 2020 therefore it is reasonable to speculate that fes might affect the transformation of fqs in the sediment as the amount of dissolved oxygen do increased however limited information could be available on the mechanistic insights into the transformation of fqs induced by fes in the sediments the objectives of this study are i to investigate the degradation of fqs in the presence of fes under ambient conditions ii to evaluate the role of do in promoting fqs removal iii to identify the key reactive oxygen species ros responsible for fqs decomposition iv to get mechanistic insights into surface catalytic oxidation of fqs on fes our experimental results provided solid evidence for the enhanced degradation of fqs induced by fes which would benefit our understanding for the transformation of antibiotics in the sediments and even shed light on

centrifugation and washing were conducted in an anaerobic chamber yqx ii shanghai hengzhi instruments which was covered with tin foil to avoid light irradiation and minimize the oxidation of fes 2 3

degradation in the presence of 0 05 g l 1 fes and 10 μm enr at ph 7 0 tba ki nbt and cat were used to quench oh surface oh o2 and h2o2 respectively wang et al 2020 xie et al 2019 moreover bpy was used to confirm whether the oxidation of fqs occurred on the fes surfaces since the complexation between fe ii and bpy could efficiently inhibit fe ii binding with fqs and reduce the electron donating ability of fe ii cheng et al 2020 2016 sun et al 2020 2 8 quantitative analysis of oh and o2 to quantify oh ba was used as a probe molecule joo et al 2005 the concentration of cumulated oh was

the concentration of p ohba respectively 2 c o h c u m c p o h b a 5 87 the concentration of generated o2 was measured by xtt method fu et al 2016 as reported xtt could react with o2 to form xtt formazan which could be detected by uv vis at 475 nm the concentration of fes and xtt were 0 05 g l 1 and 0 05 mm respectively at specific time point 0 8 ml sample was taken and mixed with 0 8 ml quenching solution 3 m hclo4 ch3oh obtained mixture was then analyzed by the uv vis spectrometer after filtration through a 0 45 µm ptfe membrane the concentration of xtt formazan was calculated

absorbance coefficient of xtt formazan and its value is 23 800 m 1 cm 1 fu et al 2016 l cm is the thickness of the absorption layer which is 1 cm in this study 2 000 000 is the conversion factor of the concentration 2 9 factors affecting the degradation of fqs by fes the effects of ph level natural organic matters nom and fes dosage were evaluated for the degradation of fqs and enr was selected to serve as the representative fq to perform degradation assays to explore the effect of ph on fq degradation 5 mm acetic acid sodium acetate buffer 5 mm mops buffer and 5 mm ches buffer were applied to control reaction ph at 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 respectively to study the effect of nom on enr degradation the initial concentration of nom was 0 50 and 100 mg l 1 respectively moreover fes concentrations ranging from 0 02 to 5 0 g l 1 were used to conduct the degradation kinetics experiments so as to investigate the effect of fes dosage on fq removal 2 10 theoretical calculations gaussian 09 w program frisch et al 2009 with density function theory dft method b3lyp becke 1993 was used to optimize the geometrical structures of fqs the 6 311 g d p basis set was applied to all atoms of fqs i e c h o n and f the truhlar s smd solvation model was used to take account the effect of solvent fang et al 2012 on the basis of optimized geometries frontier molecular orbitals i e the highest occupied molecular orbital homo and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo and the frontier electron densities feds were determined the values of 2fed2 homo and fed2 homo fed2 lumo were calculated for each atom except hydrogen to provide more precise prediction for reaction sites and elucidate the underlying degradation mechanism of fqs induced by fes oxidation 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of fqs by fes under ambient conditions as shown in fig 1a flu enr and cip could be efficiently degraded by fes suspension under ambient conditions with respective removal ratios of 79 8 87 7 and 81 5 within 240 min after fitting with pseudo first order kinetics model the k obs values were calculated as 51 6 10 3 34 0 10 3 and 25 4 10 3 min 1 for fes induced degradation of flu enr and cip respectively as shown in fig 1b after reacting for 10 min only 1 1 of enr and cip existed in the aqueous solution suggesting that residual enr and cip were almost totally adsorbed on fes surfaces for flu the residual amounts of total and aqueous fq accounted for 55 3 and 36 6 of the initial concentration indicating that the amount of flu adsorbed on fes surface after 10 min reaction accounted for 18 7 of the initial total fq as the reaction continued from 10 min to 240 min the concentrations of aqueous enr and cip gradually increased and reached plateau concentrations of 1 0 and 0 7 µm respectively therefore in addition to adsorbing fqs fes exhibited great potential to achieve efficient decomposition of fqs via self oxidation as shown in fig 1c enr could be efficiently degraded by fes at low concentrations 0 02 0 2 g l 1 within 240 min the k obs value was increased from 15 6 10 3 to 21 0 10 3 min 1 with concentration of fes increased from 0 02 to 0 2 g l 1 fig s2 however the degradation efficiency of enr decreased with further increasing the concentration of fes fig 1d and s2 as shown in fig 1d the removal rate of enr decreased from 90 to 41 1 at 240 min with fes concentration increased from 0 2 to 5 0 g l 1 as shown in fig s3 the concentrations of do decreased from 10 to 5 3 2 4 1 9 and 0 7 mg l 1 within 15 min in the presence of 0 05 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 g l 1 fes respectively do was rapidly consumed by fes at the initial reaction stage and then recovered gradually the recovery rate of do was negative to the fes concentration indicating that higher concentration of fes consumed more do the insufficient content of do might cause inhibition on enr degradation by excess fes 3 2 identification of key reactive species responsible for the removal of fqs epr experiments were conducted to explore the reactive species formed in fes suspension as shown in fig 2a a signal including four peaks with the intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 was observed in the presence of 1 10 3 and 5 10 3 g l 1 fes moreover the hyperfine splitting constant was fitted as α n α h 14 9 g suggesting the formation of dmpo oh adduct as a result oh could be produced in the fes suspension under ambient conditions moreover quenching experiments were conducted to identify reactive species that contributed to fes induced degradation of fqs as shown in fig 2b the k obs value of enr decreased by 19 7 56 5 and 14 4 in the presence of tba ki and cat respectively interestingly as an efficient quenching reagent for oh tba only exhibited a slight inhibition for the enr decomposition however the addition of ki could significantly lower the k obs of enr degradation from 34 0 10 3 to 14 8 10 3 min 1 suggesting that the oh generated on fes surfaces might play a dominant role in promoting enr degradation the inhibitory effects of cat on the degradation of enr indicated the generation of h2o2 which promoted the removal of fqs by generating oh via fenton like reaction it has been well recognized that the formation of h2o2 was commonly derived from the precursor substance o2 cheng et al 2016 in the reaction system o2 was produced as evidenced by the nbt induced inhibition for fq degradation despite negligible signals of o2 were monitored in the epr spectra possibly due to its extreme instability in aqueous environment wang et al 2020 it was reported that f could form chelate complex with fe iii on minerals surface hassani et al 2018 while negligible effects was obtained for fq removal when adding f into the reaction system indicating that fe iii would not act as the dominant reaction sites by comparison enr degradation was obviously inhibited in the presence of bpy and the fitted k obs value decreased from 34 0 10 3 to 3 7 10 3 min 1 since bpy exhibited great potential to form chelate complex with fe ii in the system cheng et al 2016 which would compete the adsorption sites with enr and subsequently inhibit the oxidation of fe ii therefore fes mineral surface oh and fe ii were served as the dominant oxidant and reaction site respectively which played an important role in promoting the degradation of fqs by sediment fes under ambient conditions furthermore the concentrations of oh and o2 were quantified by ba and xtt respectively as shown in fig 2c the cumulated concentration of oh increased gradually during fes oxidation and reached 1 7 and 10 1 μm within 240 min in the presence of 0 05 and 0 5 g l 1 fes respectively however more oh was generated in the presence of higher concentrations of fes but decreased enr removal rate was observed fig s2 fes is a reductant which could compete with enr for oh the rate constant of fe ii and oh is reported as 5 108 m 1s 1 cheng et al 2020 which indicated that high concentrations of fe ii could result in decreased utilization efficiency of oh by enr as shown in fig 2d the cumulated concentrations of xtt formazan were 19 1 12 2 8 4 and 5 7 μm at 240 min in the presence of 0 05 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 g l 1 fes respectively xtt formazan formation was negatively correlated with the concentration of fes possibly attributing to the limited do concentration fig s3 3 3 characterization of mackinawite minerals before and after reactions as shown in fig 3a six main characteristic absorption peaks of synthesized fes were observed and located at 2θ values of 17 6 30 1 39 0 50 4 53 0 and 59 1 which could be assigned to the 001 101 111 112 201 and 211 facets of mackinawite cheng et al 2020 during oxidation process the color of fes suspension clearly changed from black to brownish yellow moreover the peaks with 2θ values of 23 1 25 9 26 8 27 8 and 28 7 appeared in the xrd spectrum of oxidized fes which respectively referred to 222 026 311 040 and 313 lattice planes of elemental sulfur after removing elemental sulfur by washing with cyclohexane characteristic peaks located at 14 1 27 1 36 3 46 9 52 8 and 60 7 were obtained which could be assigned to the 020 120 031 200 151 and 231 facets of lepidocrocite moreover the xrd spectra of fes after reacting for specific time intervals were also analyzed as illustrated in fig s4 the signal intensity of fes underwent a gradual decrease as the reaction continued while an increase in the signal intensity was obtained for both lepidocrocite and elemental sulfur therefore the degradation of fqs by fes under ambient conditions was accompanied with the formation of elemental sulfur and lepidocrocite as shown in fig 3b the morphology of pristine fes was amorphous and poorly crystalline lamellar mineral crystals of 0 5 μm in length were observed on the surface of oxidized fes which could be recognized as the newly formed lepidocrocite according to the xrd results fig 3a and previously published literature an et al 2017 after reacting for 60 min spindle shaped structures appeared on the mineral surface which might be attributed to the microstructure of elemental sulfur furthermore the elemental analysis was conducted to get deep insights into the transformation mechanism of fes as shown in fig 3c fe 2p peaks of pristine fes could be divided into peaks located at 707 708 4 and 711 3 ev which could be assigned to fe ii s fe iii s and fe iii o respectively jeong et al 2010 fe ii s and fe iii s were the main species of fes during the reactions of fes fe ii s could transform into the forms of fe iii s and fe iii o moreover as reaction continued a dramatic decrease from 30 4 to 3 7 was obtained for the content of fe ii s after reacting for 60 min while the content of fe iii o increased up to 50 0 this suggested that fe ii was oxidized to fe iii on fes surface while s was replaced by o during the oxidation process as shown in fig 3d s 2p peaks of pristine fes could be divided into s2 s2 2 sn 2 and elemental sulfur with peaks located at 161 4 162 3 163 0 and 164 5 ev respectively du et al 2016 wei et al 2019 as the reaction proceeded sulfite and sulfate with peaks of 168 0 ev were observed while sulfur ions disappeared during the oxidation of fes s2 underwent gradual polymerization and oxidation through the process of s2 s2 2 sn 2 s8 jeong et al 2010 as shown in fig s5 o 1 s peaks of pristine fes was divided into two main peaks of 529 7 and 531 3 ev which referred to o2 and o h respectively jeong et al 2010 a significant increase in the o content was confirmed by the strengthened o 1 s signal intensity with the increasing reaction time which was consistent with the formation of fe oxides and fe hydroxides on the mineral surface jeong et al 2010 the changes of fe species were further analyzed to explore the transformation mechanism of fes as shown in fig s6a the concentration of total fe ii were 0 6 2 5 4 7 and 8 4 mm in the presence of 0 05 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 g l 1 fes respectively the concentration of fe ii decreased as the reaction proceeded the transformation products of s species during 0 05 g l 1 fes oxidation were also analyzed and products of sulfite and sulfate were detected fig s6b the concentration of sulfite and sulfate reached 0 06 and 0 04 μm within 240 min respectively 3 4 impact of ph and nom on the removal of fqs by fes since ph significantly affects the surface charge of minerals and existing forms of enr molecules the influence of solution ph on enr degradation by fes was investigated as shown in fig 4a the removal rate of enr increased first and then decreased as ph rose from 5 0 to 9 0 in addition ph greatly affected the content of enr in aqueous solution as the aqueous concentration of enr was the lowest at ph 7 0 during the degradation process fig s7 considering that 88 7 of enr was in the protonated form at ph 5 0 fig s8a and minerals surface was negatively charged fig s8b more enr should be adsorbed by fes minerals however more enr was released into aqueous solution with the oxidation of fes at ph 5 0 which might be attributed to the decreased surface reactive sites due to the dissolution of fes at low ph conditions 95 of enr was in the deprotonated form at ph 9 0 fig s8a which might inhibit its adsorption onto fes surfaces as shown in fig 4b enr removal rate decreased from 83 0 to 53 8 and 44 8 within 240 min in the presence of 50 and 100 mg l 1 nom respectively the corresponding k obs decreased to 8 7 10 3 and 8 1 10 3 min 1 these results indicated that nom played an inhibitory role in enr degradation by fes under ambient conditions which might be attributed to the competition between nom and enr for the adsorption sites and surface ros on fes mineral surfaces chen et al 2023 tétrault and gélinas 2022 3 5 identification of degradation products and reaction pathway elucidation to explore the degradation pathway of enr hplc qtof ms was used to identify the degradation products of enr as shown in figs 5 and s9 ten products were detected and identified two aromatic tertiary amines in piperazine ring has been reported to be easily attacked and oxidized feng et al 2018 n containing lone pairs of electrons in piperazine ring was firstly attacked by ros forming n structure since the electronegativity of n is stronger than carbon atoms the n was more likely to take electrons from the adjacent carbon atoms forming c structure an et al 2010 once c structure generated at the ethyl side chain of piperazine ring oh and h2o with lone pairs of electrons could attack the c leading to the breakaway of the ethyl side chain and produce product p9 when the c structure generated in the piperazine ring hydroxylated α c may be formed via h2o attacking when electrons of the n further attacked by ros and transferred to the α c c o group could be formed an et al 2010 as indicated by the production of p1 and p2 the c structure could also react with o2 to form peroxy radicals which could be further transformed to c c group generating product p3 an et al 2010 hydrolysis of product p3 could form hydroxylated α c adjacent to a n atom in piperazine ring which could be further oxidized to c o group by ros cleavage of c c group in piperazine ring of product p3 could be further oxidized by ros forming product p4 product p4 could be transformed to products p5 p6 and p7 via decarbonylation product p7 then underwent similar oxidation process similar to the formation of p3 and formed an enamine structure which could be further oxidized into a new product p8 finally the piperazine ring of enr was completely split and substituted with an amino group quinolone part of enr could also be oxidized by ros ros could electrophilically attack the c c group adjacent to the carboxyl group forming c structure at α c position of carboxyl group which could be rapidly attacked to form enol structure product p10 based on degradation products analysis the main degradation sites of enr were in the piperazine ring and quinolone part the above proposed reaction sites and degradation pathways were also supported by the results of theoretical calculations fig s10 the black numbers represent the values of 2fed2 homo and blue numbers represent the values of fed2 homo fed2 lumo it was reported that the atom of higher 2fed2 homo value tends to donate electrons and undergoes electrophilic reactions while the atom of higher fed2 homo fed2 lumo value is more likely to undergo radical reactions an et al 2010 the atom of the highest 2fed2 homo value 1 0289 was located at 22 n in piperazine ring of enr molecule fig s10a in addition the 2fed2 homo values of c atoms in piperazine ring were also higher than other c atoms in enr molecule these results indicated that piperazine ring in enr molecule is more likely to lose electrons to produce products p1 p3 and p9 when attacked by ros fig 5 the atom of the highest fed2 homo fed2 lumo value was 22 n 0 5149 followed by 8c 0 4825 and 7 n 0 1421 in enr molecule these results implied that the n atom in piperazine ring and c and n in quinolone part were more easily attacked in radical reactions which could form the products of p3 and p10 fig 5 as for cip molecule the atom of the highest 2fed2 homo value was located at 18 n 0 6043 in piperazine ring fig s10b while the atom of the highest fed2 homo fed2 lumo value was at 8c 0 4905 in quinolone part as for molecule without piperazine ring the atom of the highest 2fed2 homo value was located at 7 n 0 3245 in quinolone part in flu molecule fig s10c the above results indicated that piperazine ping and quinolone part of fqs structure tend to be attacked by ros 3 6 proposed mechanism for the degradation of fqs by fes based on above results we proposed the mechanism of fqs degradation by fes under ambient conditions as shown in fig 6 fqs existing in the form of zwitterionic species in the aqueous solution could be adsorbed on the surface of negatively charged fes by electrostatic attraction and the coordination of carboxyl groups with fe ii o2 could be generated from do reacting with fe ii which could attack fqs directly in addition o2 could be further converted into h2o2 which could react with fe ii to rapidly produce oh and subsequently degrade fqs the piperazine ring and the quinolone part were the main degradation sites of fqs which underwent ring opening reactions by free radicals and electrophilic attack during the fqs degradation process fes particle size became larger fig s11 and the content of surface oxygen increased fe ii in the fes finally transformed into the form of lepidocrocite accompanied with the formation of elemental sulfur 4 conclusions fqs have been widely used and inevitably released into the sediment environments which induced the generation of resistance genes and caused threats to human health in this study typical fqs i e flu enr and cip transformation in the presence of fes under ambient conditions were investigated our results showed that fes could efficiently adsorb and degrade fqs under ambient conditions do participated and played an essential role in fqs degradation by fes reactive oxygen species including o2 and surface oh were generated during fes oxidation which were responsible for fqs degradation the degradation of fqs mainly occurred at the piperazine ring and quinolone structure these results demonstrated that fes could efficiently remove fqs which enhanced the insights into the transformation of antibiotics in the sediment environments and shed light on the remediation of

15028,although surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers offers a promising technology for sensitive detection of environmental pollutants in natural waters its performance can be greatly affected by the environmental matrix the lack of identification of the origin and the underlying mechanism of matrix effect hinders the application of sers in practical environmental analysis herein with silver nanoparticles agnps as a solution based sers substrate the matrix effect from environmental waters on sers analysis and the underlying mechanisms were investigated it was found that natural water matrix could deteriorate sers performance and cause artefacts in sers spectra among various aqueous components natural organic matter nom including humic substances and proteins mainly contributed to the matrix effect on sers detection while polysaccharides or inorganic ions had minor influence the matrix effect from nom was found to be prevalent for different analytes and sers substrates the mechanism of the matrix effect from nom in the ternary system of analyte nom and nanoparticles was investigated through three mutual interactions the microheterogeneous repartition of analytes by nom other than the formation of nom corona or competitive adsorption between nom and analytes on nanoparticles was found to play the dominating role in interfering with sers detection this work

request 1 introduction developing analytical technologies that are sensitive accurate and portable is essential for the implementation of effective water quality monitoring system and the maintenance of safe water resources raman spectroscopy is a promising technique that allows for in situ environmental analysis but its low sensitivity limits the applications for pollutant detection ong et al 2020 based on the surface plasmon resonance properties of coinage metal nanostructures e g ag and au raman signal of target molecules absorbed on nanomaterials can be greatly enhanced by several orders of magnitude owing to the enhanced local electromagnetic field faulds et al 2004 this surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers technology can sensitively detect the vibrational signature of target molecules as well as the concentration ligand coordination state and molecular orientation with minor sample pretreatment ding et al 2016 these unique traits of sers have attracted enormous attentions that more than 2000 papers on the sers topic have been published annually mao et al 2021 wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2021a despite these promising capabilities of sers only a small fraction 0 1 of environmental analysis studies applied sers for real world environmental detection a significant gap between the scientific research and the practical application of sers in environmental analysis still exists panneerselvam et al 2018 a main challenge for practical application of sers in environmental pollutant analysis is from the environment matrix which hampers the exploitation of the full power of raman enhancement near the nanostructure surface previous studies have shown that interference from environmental water matrix could increase the limit of detection lod of ions lu et al 2018 pesticides han et al 2014 pathogens mao et al 2021 wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2021a and drugs patze et al 2017 by several to tens of times compared to those in pure water the full exploitation of sers capabilities requires an understanding of the role of the environmental matrix during sers analysis of various pollutants components of the environmental matrix include natural organic matter nom and various ions e g na k ca2 cl hco3 so4 2 zhang et al 2021b nom is a kind of mixture with various components including humic substances proteins polysaccharides etc wang et al 2016 all these components have the potential to interact with plasmonic nanomaterials and interfere with sers detection the presence of ubiquitously existing ions in environmental waters further complicates the interaction xu et al 2016b due to the complexity of the environmental matrix there are still lacks of detailed investigation and consensus on the origin of the matrix effect panneerselvam et al 2018 to fill the present gap in sers analysis for environmental samples it is practically necessary to identify the roles of various environmental matrices and the underlying interference mechanism this work tries to uncover these fundamental questions by identifying the matrix interference from natural waters using commonly used colloidal plasmonic nanoparticle systems i e ag and au nanoparticles to study the underlying mechanism of the matrix effect interactions in the ternary system plasmonic nanoparticles water matrix and pollutants were classified and investigated as three mutual ones i e nanoparticle analyst interactions nanoparticle matrix interactions and analyte matrix interactions based on these investigations the origin of the matrix effect the key interfering components as well as the underlying mechanisms were identified which will provide informative guidelines for practical sers applications in environmental analysis 2 experimental section 2

hydroxybenzoic acid hba p mercaptobenzoic acid mba p aminobenzoic acid aba and p aminothiophenol patp were purchased from sigma aldrich us or sinopharm chemicals beijing china before use ha was purified according to a previous study xu et al 2016a briefly ha was firstly dissolved in naoh 0 1 m and then filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane the filtrate was adjusted to ph 1 0 with hcl and centrifugated to collect the undissolved pellet the pellet was washed and dried to obtain the purified ha other chemicals were used without further purification environmental water samples were collected from two local rivers and a local wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent in hefei china these water samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm cellulose acetate membrane and stored at 4 c to remove ions samples were further dialyzed through a dialysis membrane with a molecular weight cutoff of 500 da until the conductivity was below 50 ms cm chemical oxygen demand cod was measured using the standard method apha 1998 concentrations of proteins and humic substances were measured with the lowry method frølund et al 1996 2 2 preparation and characterization of agnps and aunps borohydride reduced agnps were prepared according to the creighton method with slight modification creighton et al 1979 briefly ice cold agno3 solution 2 5 mm 100 ml was added dropwise to nabh4 solution 2 0 mm 300 ml in an ice bath under gentle stirring for over 30 min the solution containing agnps was boiled for 1 h to decompose excess nabh4 after cooling to room temperature the prepared agnps were stored

these nanoparticles was characterized by transmission electron microscopy tem h 7650 hitachi co japan the hydrodynamic diameter and ζ potential of agnp were measured on zetasizer nanozs malvern england the absorbance spectra of nanoparticles and various analytes were measured on a uv vis spectrometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan the agnp concentration was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms plasmaquad 3 thermo fisher us after digestion using 6 m nitrate acid at 90 c for 30 min 2 3 sers measurement sers measurement was performed on a raman system labram hr evolution horiba france with 532 nm 100 mw and 633 nm 30 mw lasers as excitation sources in a typical raman experiment figure s2a the agnp solution was first diluted to 18 4 mg ag l which corresponded to an lspr peak absorbance of 4 0 at 391 3 nm then 75 μl of agnp solution was added to a 96 well plate followed by 75 μl of analyte solution e g aba mba hba after incubation for 30 min at room temperature 150 μl of 1 0 m kno3 was added as the aggregation agent to generate sers hotspots the solution was mixed thoroughly and incubated for 60 s before raman spectrum collection raman spectrum was collected through a 10 objective with a numerical aperture of 0 2 olympus japan the experimental conditions were optimized by adjusting the concentration of the aggregation agent and the incubation time details could be inferred from section s1 in the supporting information to explore the influence of nom on sers detection analytes were first incubated with nom at 25 c and 200 rpm for 24 h prior to sers measurement five replicates were measured for each experimental group all the spectra were presented after baseline correction using the polynomial fitting method on labspec 6 horiba japan 2 4 study of the interaction between nom and analytes interaction between nom and analytes e g mb mo rhb was studied using the fluorescence quenching method gauthier et al 1986 in a typical quenching experiment analyte solution 5 μm was first incubated with nom solutions at different concentrations 0 60 mg l for 24 h fluorescence spectra of the mixture were then collected using a fluorescence spectrometer duetta horiba france according to the intensity change after the addition of nom the association behavior between the analyte and nom could be calculated according to the stern volmer equation gauthier et al 1986 1 f 0 f 1 k n o m where f0 and f are the fluorescence intensities of the analyte in the absence f 0 and presence f of nom and k is the nom normalized partition coefficient l mg the partition coefficient k can be determined after linearly fitting the plot of f0 f vs nom this calculation method assumes that the analyte nom complex is nonfluorescent i e that the quantum yield of the complex is zero if the fluorescence of the analyte is not totally quenched upon association with nom the observed fluorescence change will be described by the following equation gauthier et al 1986 2 f f 0 1 φ k n o m 1 k n o m where φ is the quantum yield of the complex to avoid overfitting of fluorescence quenching curves the akaike information criterion aic of these two equations was compared a model with lower aic values is more accurate for describing the interaction akaike 1974 based on the above equations the fraction of free analyte molecules α in the presence of nom can be further deduced 3 α a f a t o t a l 1 1 k n o m 100 where a t o t a l represents the total concentration of analyte and a f represents the concentration of free analyte molecules 2 5 quantifying the adsorption of analyte on agnps the adsorption of analyte on agnps was quantified according to a previously reported method zhang et al 2010 various analytes 2 μm including mb cv rf and rhb were first incubated with agnps 40 mg l at 25 c at 200 rpm for 5 h then the unbound analytes were separated by centrifugation 10 000 g 30 min twice the supernatant was collected and the absorbance spectra of the unbound analytes were collected on the uv vis spectrometer the amounts of adsorbed analytes on agnps were then quantified according to the absorbance change in the uv vis spectra before and after adsorption to explore the influence of nom on analyte adsorption analytes were first incubated with srnom 20 mg l for 24 h before experiments each experiment was conducted in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of environmental matrix on sers measurement the prepared agnps showed an average diameter of 30 3 5 0 nm figure s2b owing to the lspr effect agnps showed a distinct extinction peak at 391 3 nm in the uv vis spectrum figure s2c after optimizing the measurement parameters section s1 figure s3 agnps exhibited an enhancement factor of 1 5 105 for a typical raman reporter mba figure s2d to assess the matrix effect from environmental water samples sers detection of a model analyte p aminobenzoic acid aba in deionized water and environmental water samples lake water pond water and wwtp effluent was conducted aba was spiked into these matrices and incubated for 24 h before sers detection the sers spectrum of aba in deionized water fig 1 a showed characteristic peaks at 856 cm 1 1142 cm 1 1374 cm 1 and 1605 cm 1 which were assigned to δ coo γ nh2 v s coo and v c o respectively perry et al 2009 a highly linear relationship between sers intensity 856 cm 1 and aba concentration from 0 to 1200 μm could be obtained r2 0 995 with an lod of 21 1 μm s n 3 nevertheless after incubation in an environmental water matrix aba showed a much lower sers intensity than that in deionized water fig 1b according to the change in sers intensity at 1142 cm 1 75 of sers intensity was quenched in these environmental water matrices fig 1c in addition high background interference at 1200 1800 cm 1 also appeared in the sers spectra in various environmental water matrices abundant organic matter and cations anions coexist in environmental waters table s2 which might together contribute to the matrix effect on sers detection to distinguish the contribution of organic matter from ions environmental water samples were dialyzed to remove cations anions nevertheless the sers intensities of aba were not recovered in wwtp effluent or pond water after ion removal fig 1c suggesting that the matrix effect mainly originated from the existing organic matter as a demonstration standard river organic matter i e srnom was added manually and its effect on sers quantification was further explored similarly aba in simulated environmental water with srnom of 5 mg l showed a much weaker sers intensity than that in deionized water fig 1d after background subtraction the presence of srnom resulted in 50 loss of raman intensity at 1142 cm 1 this further demonstrated the critical contribution of organic matter to the matrix effect on environmental sers analysis the effect of nom concentration on sers detection was also investigated as shown in fig 1d the progressively increased content of srnom 0 50 mg l continually decreased the sers intensity of aba and increased the fluorescence background of the sers spectra the plot of sers intensity of aba at 1142 cm 1 versus srnom concentration fig 1e showed a nonlinear curve shape and srnom at 40 mg l could induce as high as 77 3 decrease in the sers intensity meanwhile srnom showed broad raman bands at 1350 and 1602 cm 1 and a strong fluorescence background figs 1d s4 these spectral features could be attributed to the aromatic moieties and amorphous carbon structure in nom kühn et al 2015 yang et al 2021 the prevalence of matrix effects was examined on a variety of analytes including biomolecules such as adenine and riboflavin rf and dyes such as methylene blue mb rhodamine b rhb fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc methyl orange mo aniline blue ab and crystal violet cv figure s5 sers experiments showed that the sers intensities of the analytes in nom solution relative to those in deionized water i i 0 for mb rhb adenine rf fitc mo ab and cv were 0 19 0 10 1 01 0 02 0 16 0 02 0 97 0 05 0 41 0 04 0 38 0 06 0 64 0 09 and 0 11 0 04 respectively fig 1f except for rhb and rf the sers signals of these analytes were all greatly affected by srnom as these analytes covered a broad range of molecules with different structures and charges this result implied the prevalence of the matrix effect on environmental sers quantification for various analytes in addition to agnps aunps are another widely used sers substrate and a similar matrix effect was found in the aunp based sers system figure s6 3 2 identifying the main interferents in nom by sers analysis in aquatic environments nom is a kind of heterogeneous mixture of humic substances proteins polysaccharides and other organics wang et al 2016 these nom components in three water samples were identified using excitation emission matrix fluorescence eem spectroscopy fig 2 a c standard nom samples i e ha srfa and bsa were also characterized for comparison figure s7 regions iv excitation wavelength 250 280 nm emission wavelength 380 nm and region v excitation wavelength 250 nm emission wavelength 380 nm in the eem spectra are assigned to soluble microbial byproduct like materials such as protein and humic like organics such as humic acid and fulvic acid respectively chen et al 2003 according to the fluorescence intensity distribution in each region the heterogeneous compositions of nom in different environmental waters were identified lake water showed intense fluorescence in region iv implying a high content of soluble microbial byproduct like materials comparable wwtp effluent had a higher content of humic like organics while the pond water had a relatively low content of both species these results were confirmed by chemical analysis using a modified lowry method table s2 to identify the relative contribution of these components to the matrix effect on sers detection four nom surrogates ha srfa bsa and sodium alginate were investigated notably four nom surrogates 20 mg l showed different background signals figure s4b and different effects on sers detection of aba fig 2d and e among them sodium alginate had a minor influence on the sers intensity at 1142 cm 1 i i 0 84 8 27 0 the effect of ha was similar to that of fa where 40 1 10 5 and 50 8 5 2 of the original sers intensities were retained their effects were similar to that of srnom quenching efficiency of 41 2 7 6 relatively bsa showed the most detrimental matrix effect and only 25 5 2 4 of the original sers intensity was retained therefore it can be concluded that the prevalent humic substances and proteins mainly interfere with sers analysis in natural waters 3 3 mechanism investigation of the matrix effect during sers analysis the above experiments demonstrated the critical role of nom in interfering with the sers analysis of environmental samples after excluding the impact of ions on sers detection the ternary system of the environmental matrix nanoparticles and analyte can be simplified into three mutual interactions among nom agnps and analyte 1 interaction between nom and agnps 2 interaction between analyte molecules and agnps as well as the competitive adsorption of nom in this process and 3 adsorption of analyte molecules onto nom complex formation these three interactions will be discussed in the following sections 3 3 1 interaction between nom and nanoparticles nom can overcome the electrostatic repulsion force figure s8 to adsorb onto agnps through its abundant functional groups e g phenolic oh and carboxylate groups yang et al 2021 to demonstrate the interaction between nom and plasmonic nanoparticles the morphology of the as formed nom layer using srnom as a model on agnps was confirmed by negatively stained hrtem imaging fig 3 for pristine agnps fig 3a there was a clear boundary between the nanoparticle and the supporting grid in the hrtem image when srnom was adsorbed there existed an opaque layer around agnps with a thickness of 1 3 nm fig 3b the thickness of the coating layer is approachable to the theoretical hydrodynamic diameter of some large nom surrogates nguyen et al 2021 this result demonstrates the adsorption of nom to form nom corona structure on agnps as a versatile analytical method sers detection can usually be completed in minutes therefore it is important to know the interaction dynamics between nom and agnps to achieve this purpose the adsorption process was studied by monitoring the lspr peak change of agnps after the introduction of nom fig 3c an obvious red shift of the lspr peak of agnps was observed after dosing 10 mg l srnom which could be attributed to the increase in the surface refractive index around agnps after nom corona formation yang et al 2021 the lspr peak of agnps fig 3c inset figure showed a fast red shift at first and then slowly reached equilibrium after 500 min indicating it was a two stage adsorption process through fitting the peak shift versus time curve equation s2 the adsorption rate constants at fast and slow adsorption processes were calculated to be 0 050 and 0 003 min 1 respectively nom corona can potentially increase nanoparticle stability via steric repulsion philippe and schaumann 2014 thus decreasing the generation of hot spots and the consequent sers intensity ding et al 2016 in this work the concentration of the aggregation agent i e kno3 was set at 1000 mm to generate the maximum number of hot spots section s1 figure s2 to study the influence of as formed nom corona on nanoparticle stability the hydrodynamic size change of agnps was measured fig 3d the hydrodynamic size of agnps quickly increased initially after the addition of electrolyte and began to plateau within 3000 s nevertheless the presence of srnom 10 100 mg l did not alter the aggregation speed of agnps throughout the measurement figs 3d s8 this result suggests that although nom could be adsorbed onto agnps it did not contribute to the nanoparticle stabilization and sers signal quenching under the experimental ionic condition e g 1000 mm kno3 at a limited time scale nevertheless it should be noted that srnom could well stabilize nanoparticles when the ionic strength was approximately 125 mm or less figure s9 this was demonstrated by the in situ sers measurements figure s10 which showed that srnom 10 mg l could reduce the sers intensity of patp to 4 9 of its original intensity if the aggregation agent was absent in an environmental sers analysis aggregation agents of high concentrations are usually adopted to enhance sers performance subaihi et al 2016 xu et al 2021 zeng et al 2021 therefore it was expected that the contribution of nom nanoparticle interactions to the matrix effect under such high ionic strength condition could be neglected in most cases 3 3 2 competitive adsorption between nom and analytes onto nanoparticles competitive adsorption of nom with analytes for the available sites on agnps may potentially reduce the quantity of adsorbed analytes on the nanoparticle surface and thus affect sers analysis to test this competitive adsorption hypothesis three different para substituted benzoates i e hba aba and mba were adopted as model analytes sers spectra of hba aba and mba at different concentrations in the absence or presence of srnom 5 mg l were measured fig 4 a c when exposed to nom the three analytes all exhibited intensity decrease according to the intensity versus concentration curves the lod for hba increased from 40 7 μm to 146 4 μm when srnom was added similarly the lods for aba and mba in deionized water were 21 2 and 0 11 μm respectively however they increased to 56 1 and 0 60 μm respectively when srnom was present fig 4d the limit of quantification loq s n 10 showed the same trend as the lods the loqs of hba aba and mba were 193 3 62 4 and 0 73 μm in the absence of srnom and 462 5 108 8 and 1 56 μm in the presence of srnom respectively our previous work demonstrated that the main contributing functional groups for nom adsorption onto agnps were coo and phenolic oh groups yang et al 2021 among the three analytes hba was adsorbed onto agnps through coo and phenolic oh groups while aba and mba were mainly adsorbed through nh2 and sh groups barriet et al 2007 comparably aba and mba had much higher binding energies with agnp than hba al saidi et al 2012 wei et al 2018 therefore it was expected that nom had a higher probability of competitively adsorbing onto agnps against hba and had a much more severe impact on hba detection this was evidenced by sers experiments showing that the lod for hba increased by 2 6 fold in the presence of nom considering the much lower binding energy of coo than nh2 and sh toward ag al saidi et al 2012 wei et al 2018 nom was expected to have a minor matrix effect on aba and mba detection if the competitive adsorption dominated in the matrix effect however nom still showed a high interference on sers detection of aba and mba because their lods increased by 1 6 and 4 4 fold respectively among them mba suffered from even worse matrix effect which implied that nom could affect sers detection regardless of the binding affinity of functional groups therefore the competitive adsorption between nom and the analyte for the nanoparticle surface might not be the dominant matrix effect on environmental sers analysis 3 3 3 complex formation between analyte and nom nom containing abundant functional groups as well as aromatic moieties can interact with various analytes through electrostatic interactions hafuka et al 2015 hydrogen bonding fang et al 2018 hydrophobic interactions yang et al 2022 etc the interaction might repartition analytes into free and nom bound forms and potentially affect the adsorption of analytes onto agnps and subsequent sers detection nguyen et al 2021 to measure the binding efficiency of the analyte onto nom several fluorescent analytes including mb rf rhb mo ab and fitc were investigated using the fluorescence quenching method the results show that the fluorescence intensities of mb mo ab and fitc gradually decreased when the srnom concentration increased from 0 to 60 mg l figs 5 a s11 according to the fluorescence intensity change after the introduction of nom the association parameters can be calculated using eqs 1 and 2 among these six analytes mb mo ab and fitc showed high affinities toward nom while rf and rhb only had minor interaction with nom figure s12 table s3 the nom normalized partition coefficients k for mb mo ab fitc rf and rhb were 0 025 0 0003 0 039 0 0006 0 065 0 008 0 310 0 128 l mg 0 002 0 0004 and 0 002 0 0004 respectively furthermore our results indicated no direct correlation between k and the physiochemical properties e g pk a and octanol water partition coefficient log k ow of these analytes which implies the complex interaction mechanisms between nom and various analytes table s1 and figure s13 according to eq 3 when nom was 20 mg l the fraction of free analyte molecules α in the presence of nom for mb mo ab and fitc were 67 7 56 2 43 5 and 13 9 respectively this kind of microheterogeneous redistribution of analyte molecules into nom bound and nom free forms might reduce the affinity between the analyte and agnps relatively rhb and rf did not show obvious fluorescence intensity decreases under nom exposure indicating that they mainly existed as free molecules in nom containing matrices the partition of analytes into nom bound form might alter their affinities toward agnps and therefore change their adsorption amount to verify this hypothesis the adsorption of each molecule by agnps was quantified figs 5 s14 according to the uv vis absorbance spectrum of mb after incubation with agnps 31 0 of mb molecules were adsorbed fig 5c after incubation with srnom 10 mg l only 18 2 of the total mb molecules were adsorbed at the same time the absorbance spectrum of mb showed an obvious red shift to 668 nm indicating that the interaction between nom and mb occurred this result demonstrated that nom could indeed reduce the amount of mb adsorbed on agnps which as a result affected its sers intensity in the case of rhb after incubation with agnps 29 7 of rhb molecules were adsorbed fig 5d relatively the presence of srnom did not reduce the absorption of rhb onto agnps which agreed well with fluorescence results however it is difficult to accurately determine the adsorption amount of the other four analytes onto agnps because of the spectra overlap of agnps and the analytes figure s14 the relationship between analyte nom complex formation and the matrix effect was analyzed it can be inferred from the sers results figs 1f s4 that nom had a severe matrix effect on sers analysis for mb mo ab and fitc while it had a minor effect on rhb and rf through plotting i i 0 versus k fig 5e the relationship between the matrix effect and the partition behavior of each analyte could be deduced it was observed that an analyte with a larger k 0 01 l mg was more sensitive to the matrix effect and vice versa meanwhile the fraction of free analyte molecules α showed a similar trend free molecules decreased with increasing k fitting the i i 0 versus k curve using eq 3 only gave a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 17 suggesting that although there was a similar trend between the matrix effect and partition the matrix effect could not be fully quantified using the partition mechanism this was reasonable because the perquisite for fitting using the partition equation was that nom bound analytes could not adsorb onto nanoparticles however this hypothesis might not be suitable for all analytes especially when their charges functional groups and molecular weights were quite different nguyen et al 2005 qu et al 2013 based on above investigations it could be concluded that the matrix effect mainly originated from the partition of analyte molecules by nom and the reduced amount of analyte adsorbed onto nanoparticles fig 5f in natural environments there are also abundant particulate matters which is larger than 0 45 μm and include microorganisms clays and aggregates he et al 2016 the distribution of pollutants among these particulate matters may also be considered in future sers studies to minimize the matrix effect from nom potential approaches can be taken one approach is to develop proper sample pretreatment techniques e g solvent extraction that can break the binding between the analyte and the nom another approach is to develop signal processing methods background correction multivariate analysis and artificial neural network based algorithms that can remove spectral artifacts and extract useful sers signal from complex background barmpalexis et al 2018 byrne et al 2016 meanwhile the matrix effects of nom vary among different analytes particularly almost no matrix effects of nom were found for sers detection of rf and rhb therefore sample pretreatment may not be necessary for sers detection of these analytes in environmental waters thus enabling their rapid detection in real world environments 4 conclusion this work investigated the matrix effect from aquatic environments as well as the interfering mechanism during environmental sers analysis it was found that nom components including humic substances and proteins could induce matrix effects while polysaccharides and ions had minor effects on sers detection the formation of nom corona on the nanoparticle surface as well as the competitive adsorption between nom and analytes did not account for the matrix effect on sers detection the matrix effect mainly originated from the complex formation between analyte molecules and nom the microheterogeneous repartition of analyte molecules by nom into nom bound form could reduce the adsorption of analytes onto nanoparticles thus deteriorating sers detection declaration of competing interest the authors

15028,although surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers offers a promising technology for sensitive detection of environmental pollutants in natural waters its performance can be greatly affected by the environmental matrix the lack of identification of the origin and the underlying mechanism of matrix effect hinders the application of sers in practical environmental analysis herein with silver nanoparticles agnps as a solution based sers substrate the matrix effect from environmental waters on sers analysis and the underlying mechanisms were investigated it was found that natural water matrix could deteriorate sers performance and cause artefacts in sers spectra among various aqueous components natural organic matter nom including humic substances and proteins mainly contributed to the matrix effect on sers detection while polysaccharides or inorganic ions had minor influence the matrix effect from nom was found to be prevalent for different analytes and sers substrates the mechanism of the matrix effect from nom in the ternary system of analyte nom and nanoparticles was investigated through three mutual interactions the microheterogeneous repartition of analytes by nom other than the formation of nom corona or competitive adsorption between nom and analytes on nanoparticles was found to play the dominating role in interfering with sers detection this work

request 1 introduction developing analytical technologies that are sensitive accurate and portable is essential for the implementation of effective water quality monitoring system and the maintenance of safe water resources raman spectroscopy is a promising technique that allows for in situ environmental analysis but its low sensitivity limits the applications for pollutant detection ong et al 2020 based on the surface plasmon resonance properties of coinage metal nanostructures e g ag and au raman signal of target molecules absorbed on nanomaterials can be greatly enhanced by several orders of magnitude owing to the enhanced local electromagnetic field faulds et al 2004 this surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers technology can sensitively detect the vibrational signature of target molecules as well as the concentration ligand coordination state and molecular orientation with minor sample pretreatment ding et al 2016 these unique traits of sers have attracted enormous attentions that more than 2000 papers on the sers topic have been published annually mao et al 2021 wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2021a despite these promising capabilities of sers only a small fraction 0 1 of environmental analysis studies applied sers for real world environmental detection a significant gap between the scientific research and the practical application of sers in environmental analysis still exists panneerselvam et al 2018 a main challenge for practical application of sers in environmental pollutant analysis is from the environment matrix which hampers the exploitation of the full power of raman enhancement near the nanostructure surface previous studies have shown that interference from environmental water matrix could increase the limit of detection lod of ions lu et al 2018 pesticides han et al 2014 pathogens mao et al 2021 wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2021a and drugs patze et al 2017 by several to tens of times compared to those in pure water the full exploitation of sers capabilities requires an understanding of the role of the environmental matrix during sers analysis of various pollutants components of the environmental matrix include natural organic matter nom and various ions e g na k ca2 cl hco3 so4 2 zhang et al 2021b nom is a kind of mixture with various components including humic substances proteins polysaccharides etc wang et al 2016 all these components have the potential to interact with plasmonic nanomaterials and interfere with sers detection the presence of ubiquitously existing ions in environmental waters further complicates the interaction xu et al 2016b due to the complexity of the environmental matrix there are still lacks of detailed investigation and consensus on the origin of the matrix effect panneerselvam et al 2018 to fill the present gap in sers analysis for environmental samples it is practically necessary to identify the roles of various environmental matrices and the underlying interference mechanism this work tries to uncover these fundamental questions by identifying the matrix interference from natural waters using commonly used colloidal plasmonic nanoparticle systems i e ag and au nanoparticles to study the underlying mechanism of the matrix effect interactions in the ternary system plasmonic nanoparticles water matrix and pollutants were classified and investigated as three mutual ones i e nanoparticle analyst interactions nanoparticle matrix interactions and analyte matrix interactions based on these investigations the origin of the matrix effect the key interfering components as well as the underlying mechanisms were identified which will provide informative guidelines for practical sers applications in environmental analysis 2 experimental section 2

hydroxybenzoic acid hba p mercaptobenzoic acid mba p aminobenzoic acid aba and p aminothiophenol patp were purchased from sigma aldrich us or sinopharm chemicals beijing china before use ha was purified according to a previous study xu et al 2016a briefly ha was firstly dissolved in naoh 0 1 m and then filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane the filtrate was adjusted to ph 1 0 with hcl and centrifugated to collect the undissolved pellet the pellet was washed and dried to obtain the purified ha other chemicals were used without further purification environmental water samples were collected from two local rivers and a local wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent in hefei china these water samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm cellulose acetate membrane and stored at 4 c to remove ions samples were further dialyzed through a dialysis membrane with a molecular weight cutoff of 500 da until the conductivity was below 50 ms cm chemical oxygen demand cod was measured using the standard method apha 1998 concentrations of proteins and humic substances were measured with the lowry method frølund et al 1996 2 2 preparation and characterization of agnps and aunps borohydride reduced agnps were prepared according to the creighton method with slight modification creighton et al 1979 briefly ice cold agno3 solution 2 5 mm 100 ml was added dropwise to nabh4 solution 2 0 mm 300 ml in an ice bath under gentle stirring for over 30 min the solution containing agnps was boiled for 1 h to decompose excess nabh4 after cooling to room temperature the prepared agnps were stored

these nanoparticles was characterized by transmission electron microscopy tem h 7650 hitachi co japan the hydrodynamic diameter and ζ potential of agnp were measured on zetasizer nanozs malvern england the absorbance spectra of nanoparticles and various analytes were measured on a uv vis spectrometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan the agnp concentration was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms plasmaquad 3 thermo fisher us after digestion using 6 m nitrate acid at 90 c for 30 min 2 3 sers measurement sers measurement was performed on a raman system labram hr evolution horiba france with 532 nm 100 mw and 633 nm 30 mw lasers as excitation sources in a typical raman experiment figure s2a the agnp solution was first diluted to 18 4 mg ag l which corresponded to an lspr peak absorbance of 4 0 at 391 3 nm then 75 μl of agnp solution was added to a 96 well plate followed by 75 μl of analyte solution e g aba mba hba after incubation for 30 min at room temperature 150 μl of 1 0 m kno3 was added as the aggregation agent to generate sers hotspots the solution was mixed thoroughly and incubated for 60 s before raman spectrum collection raman spectrum was collected through a 10 objective with a numerical aperture of 0 2 olympus japan the experimental conditions were optimized by adjusting the concentration of the aggregation agent and the incubation time details could be inferred from section s1 in the supporting information to explore the influence of nom on sers detection analytes were first incubated with nom at 25 c and 200 rpm for 24 h prior to sers measurement five replicates were measured for each experimental group all the spectra were presented after baseline correction using the polynomial fitting method on labspec 6 horiba japan 2 4 study of the interaction between nom and analytes interaction between nom and analytes e g mb mo rhb was studied using the fluorescence quenching method gauthier et al 1986 in a typical quenching experiment analyte solution 5 μm was first incubated with nom solutions at different concentrations 0 60 mg l for 24 h fluorescence spectra of the mixture were then collected using a fluorescence spectrometer duetta horiba france according to the intensity change after the addition of nom the association behavior between the analyte and nom could be calculated according to the stern volmer equation gauthier et al 1986 1 f 0 f 1 k n o m where f0 and f are the fluorescence intensities of the analyte in the absence f 0 and presence f of nom and k is the nom normalized partition coefficient l mg the partition coefficient k can be determined after linearly fitting the plot of f0 f vs nom this calculation method assumes that the analyte nom complex is nonfluorescent i e that the quantum yield of the complex is zero if the fluorescence of the analyte is not totally quenched upon association with nom the observed fluorescence change will be described by the following equation gauthier et al 1986 2 f f 0 1 φ k n o m 1 k n o m where φ is the quantum yield of the complex to avoid overfitting of fluorescence quenching curves the akaike information criterion aic of these two equations was compared a model with lower aic values is more accurate for describing the interaction akaike 1974 based on the above equations the fraction of free analyte molecules α in the presence of nom can be further deduced 3 α a f a t o t a l 1 1 k n o m 100 where a t o t a l represents the total concentration of analyte and a f represents the concentration of free analyte molecules 2 5 quantifying the adsorption of analyte on agnps the adsorption of analyte on agnps was quantified according to a previously reported method zhang et al 2010 various analytes 2 μm including mb cv rf and rhb were first incubated with agnps 40 mg l at 25 c at 200 rpm for 5 h then the unbound analytes were separated by centrifugation 10 000 g 30 min twice the supernatant was collected and the absorbance spectra of the unbound analytes were collected on the uv vis spectrometer the amounts of adsorbed analytes on agnps were then quantified according to the absorbance change in the uv vis spectra before and after adsorption to explore the influence of nom on analyte adsorption analytes were first incubated with srnom 20 mg l for 24 h before experiments each experiment was conducted in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of environmental matrix on sers measurement the prepared agnps showed an average diameter of 30 3 5 0 nm figure s2b owing to the lspr effect agnps showed a distinct extinction peak at 391 3 nm in the uv vis spectrum figure s2c after optimizing the measurement parameters section s1 figure s3 agnps exhibited an enhancement factor of 1 5 105 for a typical raman reporter mba figure s2d to assess the matrix effect from environmental water samples sers detection of a model analyte p aminobenzoic acid aba in deionized water and environmental water samples lake water pond water and wwtp effluent was conducted aba was spiked into these matrices and incubated for 24 h before sers detection the sers spectrum of aba in deionized water fig 1 a showed characteristic peaks at 856 cm 1 1142 cm 1 1374 cm 1 and 1605 cm 1 which were assigned to δ coo γ nh2 v s coo and v c o respectively perry et al 2009 a highly linear relationship between sers intensity 856 cm 1 and aba concentration from 0 to 1200 μm could be obtained r2 0 995 with an lod of 21 1 μm s n 3 nevertheless after incubation in an environmental water matrix aba showed a much lower sers intensity than that in deionized water fig 1b according to the change in sers intensity at 1142 cm 1 75 of sers intensity was quenched in these environmental water matrices fig 1c in addition high background interference at 1200 1800 cm 1 also appeared in the sers spectra in various environmental water matrices abundant organic matter and cations anions coexist in environmental waters table s2 which might together contribute to the matrix effect on sers detection to distinguish the contribution of organic matter from ions environmental water samples were dialyzed to remove cations anions nevertheless the sers intensities of aba were not recovered in wwtp effluent or pond water after ion removal fig 1c suggesting that the matrix effect mainly originated from the existing organic matter as a demonstration standard river organic matter i e srnom was added manually and its effect on sers quantification was further explored similarly aba in simulated environmental water with srnom of 5 mg l showed a much weaker sers intensity than that in deionized water fig 1d after background subtraction the presence of srnom resulted in 50 loss of raman intensity at 1142 cm 1 this further demonstrated the critical contribution of organic matter to the matrix effect on environmental sers analysis the effect of nom concentration on sers detection was also investigated as shown in fig 1d the progressively increased content of srnom 0 50 mg l continually decreased the sers intensity of aba and increased the fluorescence background of the sers spectra the plot of sers intensity of aba at 1142 cm 1 versus srnom concentration fig 1e showed a nonlinear curve shape and srnom at 40 mg l could induce as high as 77 3 decrease in the sers intensity meanwhile srnom showed broad raman bands at 1350 and 1602 cm 1 and a strong fluorescence background figs 1d s4 these spectral features could be attributed to the aromatic moieties and amorphous carbon structure in nom kühn et al 2015 yang et al 2021 the prevalence of matrix effects was examined on a variety of analytes including biomolecules such as adenine and riboflavin rf and dyes such as methylene blue mb rhodamine b rhb fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc methyl orange mo aniline blue ab and crystal violet cv figure s5 sers experiments showed that the sers intensities of the analytes in nom solution relative to those in deionized water i i 0 for mb rhb adenine rf fitc mo ab and cv were 0 19 0 10 1 01 0 02 0 16 0 02 0 97 0 05 0 41 0 04 0 38 0 06 0 64 0 09 and 0 11 0 04 respectively fig 1f except for rhb and rf the sers signals of these analytes were all greatly affected by srnom as these analytes covered a broad range of molecules with different structures and charges this result implied the prevalence of the matrix effect on environmental sers quantification for various analytes in addition to agnps aunps are another widely used sers substrate and a similar matrix effect was found in the aunp based sers system figure s6 3 2 identifying the main interferents in nom by sers analysis in aquatic environments nom is a kind of heterogeneous mixture of humic substances proteins polysaccharides and other organics wang et al 2016 these nom components in three water samples were identified using excitation emission matrix fluorescence eem spectroscopy fig 2 a c standard nom samples i e ha srfa and bsa were also characterized for comparison figure s7 regions iv excitation wavelength 250 280 nm emission wavelength 380 nm and region v excitation wavelength 250 nm emission wavelength 380 nm in the eem spectra are assigned to soluble microbial byproduct like materials such as protein and humic like organics such as humic acid and fulvic acid respectively chen et al 2003 according to the fluorescence intensity distribution in each region the heterogeneous compositions of nom in different environmental waters were identified lake water showed intense fluorescence in region iv implying a high content of soluble microbial byproduct like materials comparable wwtp effluent had a higher content of humic like organics while the pond water had a relatively low content of both species these results were confirmed by chemical analysis using a modified lowry method table s2 to identify the relative contribution of these components to the matrix effect on sers detection four nom surrogates ha srfa bsa and sodium alginate were investigated notably four nom surrogates 20 mg l showed different background signals figure s4b and different effects on sers detection of aba fig 2d and e among them sodium alginate had a minor influence on the sers intensity at 1142 cm 1 i i 0 84 8 27 0 the effect of ha was similar to that of fa where 40 1 10 5 and 50 8 5 2 of the original sers intensities were retained their effects were similar to that of srnom quenching efficiency of 41 2 7 6 relatively bsa showed the most detrimental matrix effect and only 25 5 2 4 of the original sers intensity was retained therefore it can be concluded that the prevalent humic substances and proteins mainly interfere with sers analysis in natural waters 3 3 mechanism investigation of the matrix effect during sers analysis the above experiments demonstrated the critical role of nom in interfering with the sers analysis of environmental samples after excluding the impact of ions on sers detection the ternary system of the environmental matrix nanoparticles and analyte can be simplified into three mutual interactions among nom agnps and analyte 1 interaction between nom and agnps 2 interaction between analyte molecules and agnps as well as the competitive adsorption of nom in this process and 3 adsorption of analyte molecules onto nom complex formation these three interactions will be discussed in the following sections 3 3 1 interaction between nom and nanoparticles nom can overcome the electrostatic repulsion force figure s8 to adsorb onto agnps through its abundant functional groups e g phenolic oh and carboxylate groups yang et al 2021 to demonstrate the interaction between nom and plasmonic nanoparticles the morphology of the as formed nom layer using srnom as a model on agnps was confirmed by negatively stained hrtem imaging fig 3 for pristine agnps fig 3a there was a clear boundary between the nanoparticle and the supporting grid in the hrtem image when srnom was adsorbed there existed an opaque layer around agnps with a thickness of 1 3 nm fig 3b the thickness of the coating layer is approachable to the theoretical hydrodynamic diameter of some large nom surrogates nguyen et al 2021 this result demonstrates the adsorption of nom to form nom corona structure on agnps as a versatile analytical method sers detection can usually be completed in minutes therefore it is important to know the interaction dynamics between nom and agnps to achieve this purpose the adsorption process was studied by monitoring the lspr peak change of agnps after the introduction of nom fig 3c an obvious red shift of the lspr peak of agnps was observed after dosing 10 mg l srnom which could be attributed to the increase in the surface refractive index around agnps after nom corona formation yang et al 2021 the lspr peak of agnps fig 3c inset figure showed a fast red shift at first and then slowly reached equilibrium after 500 min indicating it was a two stage adsorption process through fitting the peak shift versus time curve equation s2 the adsorption rate constants at fast and slow adsorption processes were calculated to be 0 050 and 0 003 min 1 respectively nom corona can potentially increase nanoparticle stability via steric repulsion philippe and schaumann 2014 thus decreasing the generation of hot spots and the consequent sers intensity ding et al 2016 in this work the concentration of the aggregation agent i e kno3 was set at 1000 mm to generate the maximum number of hot spots section s1 figure s2 to study the influence of as formed nom corona on nanoparticle stability the hydrodynamic size change of agnps was measured fig 3d the hydrodynamic size of agnps quickly increased initially after the addition of electrolyte and began to plateau within 3000 s nevertheless the presence of srnom 10 100 mg l did not alter the aggregation speed of agnps throughout the measurement figs 3d s8 this result suggests that although nom could be adsorbed onto agnps it did not contribute to the nanoparticle stabilization and sers signal quenching under the experimental ionic condition e g 1000 mm kno3 at a limited time scale nevertheless it should be noted that srnom could well stabilize nanoparticles when the ionic strength was approximately 125 mm or less figure s9 this was demonstrated by the in situ sers measurements figure s10 which showed that srnom 10 mg l could reduce the sers intensity of patp to 4 9 of its original intensity if the aggregation agent was absent in an environmental sers analysis aggregation agents of high concentrations are usually adopted to enhance sers performance subaihi et al 2016 xu et al 2021 zeng et al 2021 therefore it was expected that the contribution of nom nanoparticle interactions to the matrix effect under such high ionic strength condition could be neglected in most cases 3 3 2 competitive adsorption between nom and analytes onto nanoparticles competitive adsorption of nom with analytes for the available sites on agnps may potentially reduce the quantity of adsorbed analytes on the nanoparticle surface and thus affect sers analysis to test this competitive adsorption hypothesis three different para substituted benzoates i e hba aba and mba were adopted as model analytes sers spectra of hba aba and mba at different concentrations in the absence or presence of srnom 5 mg l were measured fig 4 a c when exposed to nom the three analytes all exhibited intensity decrease according to the intensity versus concentration curves the lod for hba increased from 40 7 μm to 146 4 μm when srnom was added similarly the lods for aba and mba in deionized water were 21 2 and 0 11 μm respectively however they increased to 56 1 and 0 60 μm respectively when srnom was present fig 4d the limit of quantification loq s n 10 showed the same trend as the lods the loqs of hba aba and mba were 193 3 62 4 and 0 73 μm in the absence of srnom and 462 5 108 8 and 1 56 μm in the presence of srnom respectively our previous work demonstrated that the main contributing functional groups for nom adsorption onto agnps were coo and phenolic oh groups yang et al 2021 among the three analytes hba was adsorbed onto agnps through coo and phenolic oh groups while aba and mba were mainly adsorbed through nh2 and sh groups barriet et al 2007 comparably aba and mba had much higher binding energies with agnp than hba al saidi et al 2012 wei et al 2018 therefore it was expected that nom had a higher probability of competitively adsorbing onto agnps against hba and had a much more severe impact on hba detection this was evidenced by sers experiments showing that the lod for hba increased by 2 6 fold in the presence of nom considering the much lower binding energy of coo than nh2 and sh toward ag al saidi et al 2012 wei et al 2018 nom was expected to have a minor matrix effect on aba and mba detection if the competitive adsorption dominated in the matrix effect however nom still showed a high interference on sers detection of aba and mba because their lods increased by 1 6 and 4 4 fold respectively among them mba suffered from even worse matrix effect which implied that nom could affect sers detection regardless of the binding affinity of functional groups therefore the competitive adsorption between nom and the analyte for the nanoparticle surface might not be the dominant matrix effect on environmental sers analysis 3 3 3 complex formation between analyte and nom nom containing abundant functional groups as well as aromatic moieties can interact with various analytes through electrostatic interactions hafuka et al 2015 hydrogen bonding fang et al 2018 hydrophobic interactions yang et al 2022 etc the interaction might repartition analytes into free and nom bound forms and potentially affect the adsorption of analytes onto agnps and subsequent sers detection nguyen et al 2021 to measure the binding efficiency of the analyte onto nom several fluorescent analytes including mb rf rhb mo ab and fitc were investigated using the fluorescence quenching method the results show that the fluorescence intensities of mb mo ab and fitc gradually decreased when the srnom concentration increased from 0 to 60 mg l figs 5 a s11 according to the fluorescence intensity change after the introduction of nom the association parameters can be calculated using eqs 1 and 2 among these six analytes mb mo ab and fitc showed high affinities toward nom while rf and rhb only had minor interaction with nom figure s12 table s3 the nom normalized partition coefficients k for mb mo ab fitc rf and rhb were 0 025 0 0003 0 039 0 0006 0 065 0 008 0 310 0 128 l mg 0 002 0 0004 and 0 002 0 0004 respectively furthermore our results indicated no direct correlation between k and the physiochemical properties e g pk a and octanol water partition coefficient log k ow of these analytes which implies the complex interaction mechanisms between nom and various analytes table s1 and figure s13 according to eq 3 when nom was 20 mg l the fraction of free analyte molecules α in the presence of nom for mb mo ab and fitc were 67 7 56 2 43 5 and 13 9 respectively this kind of microheterogeneous redistribution of analyte molecules into nom bound and nom free forms might reduce the affinity between the analyte and agnps relatively rhb and rf did not show obvious fluorescence intensity decreases under nom exposure indicating that they mainly existed as free molecules in nom containing matrices the partition of analytes into nom bound form might alter their affinities toward agnps and therefore change their adsorption amount to verify this hypothesis the adsorption of each molecule by agnps was quantified figs 5 s14 according to the uv vis absorbance spectrum of mb after incubation with agnps 31 0 of mb molecules were adsorbed fig 5c after incubation with srnom 10 mg l only 18 2 of the total mb molecules were adsorbed at the same time the absorbance spectrum of mb showed an obvious red shift to 668 nm indicating that the interaction between nom and mb occurred this result demonstrated that nom could indeed reduce the amount of mb adsorbed on agnps which as a result affected its sers intensity in the case of rhb after incubation with agnps 29 7 of rhb molecules were adsorbed fig 5d relatively the presence of srnom did not reduce the absorption of rhb onto agnps which agreed well with fluorescence results however it is difficult to accurately determine the adsorption amount of the other four analytes onto agnps because of the spectra overlap of agnps and the analytes figure s14 the relationship between analyte nom complex formation and the matrix effect was analyzed it can be inferred from the sers results figs 1f s4 that nom had a severe matrix effect on sers analysis for mb mo ab and fitc while it had a minor effect on rhb and rf through plotting i i 0 versus k fig 5e the relationship between the matrix effect and the partition behavior of each analyte could be deduced it was observed that an analyte with a larger k 0 01 l mg was more sensitive to the matrix effect and vice versa meanwhile the fraction of free analyte molecules α showed a similar trend free molecules decreased with increasing k fitting the i i 0 versus k curve using eq 3 only gave a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 17 suggesting that although there was a similar trend between the matrix effect and partition the matrix effect could not be fully quantified using the partition mechanism this was reasonable because the perquisite for fitting using the partition equation was that nom bound analytes could not adsorb onto nanoparticles however this hypothesis might not be suitable for all analytes especially when their charges functional groups and molecular weights were quite different nguyen et al 2005 qu et al 2013 based on above investigations it could be concluded that the matrix effect mainly originated from the partition of analyte molecules by nom and the reduced amount of analyte adsorbed onto nanoparticles fig 5f in natural environments there are also abundant particulate matters which is larger than 0 45 μm and include microorganisms clays and aggregates he et al 2016 the distribution of pollutants among these particulate matters may also be considered in future sers studies to minimize the matrix effect from nom potential approaches can be taken one approach is to develop proper sample pretreatment techniques e g solvent extraction that can break the binding between the analyte and the nom another approach is to develop signal processing methods background correction multivariate analysis and artificial neural network based algorithms that can remove spectral artifacts and extract useful sers signal from complex background barmpalexis et al 2018 byrne et al 2016 meanwhile the matrix effects of nom vary among different analytes particularly almost no matrix effects of nom were found for sers detection of rf and rhb therefore sample pretreatment may not be necessary for sers detection of these analytes in environmental waters thus enabling their rapid detection in real world environments 4 conclusion this work investigated the matrix effect from aquatic environments as well as the interfering mechanism during environmental sers analysis it was found that nom components including humic substances and proteins could induce matrix effects while polysaccharides and ions had minor effects on sers detection the formation of nom corona on the nanoparticle surface as well as the competitive adsorption between nom and analytes did not account for the matrix effect on sers detection the matrix effect mainly originated from the complex formation between analyte molecules and nom the microheterogeneous repartition of analyte molecules by nom into nom bound form could reduce the adsorption of analytes onto nanoparticles thus deteriorating sers detection declaration of competing interest the authors

wastewater blackbeard et al 2016 dickenson et al 2009 wert et al 2009 in the case of pathogen inactivation a risk based approach namely critical control point approach has been developed and used to manage ozone operations it includes critical operating parameters and assigned log reduction value lrv credits for a particular pathogen as such the performance of pathogen inactivation by an ozone barrier can be operated in a predictive manner nhmrc nrmmc 2018 nrmmc 2008 usepa 2018 vicdoh 2013 as to chemical removal o3 has been demonstrated to react with organic chemicals in an aqueous system through direct action of molecular o3 or through the action of induced free radicals mainly hydroxyl oh radicals altmann et al 2014 gottschalk et al 2009 molecular o3 is a selective electrophile that reacts quickly to chemicals with electron donating groups edg e g conjugated double bonds activated aromatic systems and deprotonated amines these preferred reaction pathways allow an assessment of the likelihood of o3 reacting with a particular coc dickenson et al 2009 michael and von gunten 1999 von gunten 2003 however the oh radical is known to react less selectively with chemicals than molecular o3 and provides an opportunity to oxidise those chemical compounds that are recalcitrant to o3 michael and von gunten 1999 analogous to the pathogen risks there are an increasing number and diversity of chemical contaminants nhmrc nrmmc 2018 one approach that allows chemical contaminants to develop mechanistically relevant barrier credits is to focus on the chemical characteristics to the key removal mechanisms with the consideration of critical operating parameters in the ozone barrier according to the mechanistic response to ozone barrier dickenson et al dickenson et al 2009 has developed a chemical classification approach by using a chemical structure analysis and the molecular response to o3 blackbeard et al blackbeard et al 2016 has proposed another chemical classification approach based on chemical s reaction rate constants with o3 and the oh radical but the relationship between the two classifications hasn t been developed buffle et al buffle et al 2006 and wert et al wert et al 2009 have indicated the significant impacts of the operational parameters of dosed ozone and total organic carbon ratio o3 toc ratio and ozone o3 residual concentration by time ct value o3 ct mg min l on molecular o3 decomposition and oh radical production and hence significant influences on chemical removal however in the existing ozone studies there is still not an assessment of chemical removal using a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value as operating parameters additionally during the barrier operation a dominant issue is the high cost of analytical testing of coc to ensure that these contaminants are removed to below guideline levels scales et al 2019 a surrogate parameter tailored to monitor the removal performance of risks across a barrier is commonly utilized nhmrc nrmmc 2018 in terms of the coc removal through an ozonation process a surrogate parameter is often a quantifiable change of a bulk parameter that can serve as a performance measure of a barrier in controlling the removal of a group of coc drewes et al 2009 dickenson et al dickenson et al 2009 demonstrated the possibility of using changes of ultraviolet absorbence at 254 nm uv254 as a surrogate parameter to assess the removal efficiency of trace organic chemicals from the chemical structure therefore the development of a risk based credit framework to predict the removal efficiency of coc is the objective of this study the exploration of appropriate parameters as the surrogate to validate the ozone performance and the consideration of a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value as critical operating parameters during the ozonation process are of interest herein this includes an understanding of the correlation between the diverse reaction mechanisms elucidated for the coc reaction with molecular o3 or the oh radical at a known ozone dose condition and chemical structure in the reclamation of wastewater it is common to use secondary treated wastewater effluent as a feed for a further treatment process to produce reclaimed water northcott et al 2015 sarkis et al 2013 eastern treatment plant etp operated by melbourne water melbourne australia treats nearly 330 million litres melbourne s sewage per day and uses an intensive three stage treatment process including primary treatment secondary treatment and tertiary treatment blackbeard et al 2016 it has several functional barriers including pre ozonation biological filtration post ozonation ultraviolet uv disinfection and chlorination cl2 this study provides a bench scale experimental assessment of the ozone barrier for coc removal from the secondary effluent of etp and the data is compared directly to full scale operations it includes the classification of compounds detected in the effluents according to the chemical structure and the selection of compounds to serve as target chemical indicators according to their designation as fast reacting or slow reacting with o3 and the oh radical so as to compare their removal and define the removal mechanisms of a chemical by ozone it also assesses the influencing factors that may affect coc removal performance including short to long o3 contact time low to high dosed o3 toc ratios and various achieved o3 ct values mg min l at the core of the assessment is the potential of a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value to act as the operating criteria to monitor removal performance during the operation additionally the study proposes a prediction and management process for the etp full scale ozone operations with proposed barrier credits for a range of classes of chemicals the application to all ozone barriers is then considered including potential control strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 bench scale tests 2 1 1 wastewater samples and preparation wastewater samples were collected from the eastern treatment plant etp melbourne australia samples for bench scale tests were secondary effluent prior to injection of o3 the sampling point is indicated in fig 1 40 l of wastewater was collected with sampling containers these containers were precleaned with methanol milli q water and then dried prior to use and were rinsed with water sample during the sampling process all collected samples were transported on ice to the laboratory samples for assessment of full scale performance were collected from the points as indicated in fig 1 once wastewater samples arrived in the laboratory they were filtered under vacuum using glass microfiber filters with 1 2 μm pore size whatman 1822 047 gf c sigma aldrich australia filtered samples were refrigerated at 4 c prior to subsequent measurement the coarse pore size filtration was intended to remove only large debris such like microorganisms from the sample 2 1 2 ozone determination in water ozone saturation and residual concentrations in water were determined based on the apha standard method 4500 o3 using indigo trisulfonate solution its sigma aldrich australia apha awwa wef 1992 bader and hoigné 1981 an agilent cary 60 uv vis spectrophotometer santa clara usa was used for analysis 2 1 3 generation of saturated ozone water an ozone generator a2z ozone system inc australia was used to generate o3 at a rate of 13 g h by using compressed oxygen o3 was injected into milli q water for a minimum time 20 min t 20 c to generate saturated o3 water fig s1 this was determined by the variation of three consecutive o3 concentration measurements according to the apha standard method 4500 o3 so as to be in a range of 10 every 5 min the o3 saturation concentration in milli q water was measured to be between 16 0 and 19 1 mg l at room temperature t 20 c 2 1 4 determination of dosed o3 toc ratio in order to determine the dosed o3 toc ratios used in the bench scale tests natural ozone decay tests were conducted using milli q water to determine the spontaneous o3 decomposition characteristics without coc the results fig s2 show that the dissolved o3 residual had a half life of approximately 30 min in milli q water it should be noted that this natural o3 decay in milli q water needs to be added into the calculation of o3 decomposition in wastewater samples during coc removal in water by ozone o3 decomposition that takes place within the initial 30 s of ozonation can be referred as the instantaneous ozone demand iod usually the iod can be calculated based on the transferred o3 dose and dissolved o3 residual observed after 30 s to provide an understanding of o3 reactivity at a known concentration or oh radical reactivity at an unknown concentration also it has been shown that significant oh radical formation occurs during the iod initial 30 s wert et al 2009 a relationship between the dosed o3 toc ratio 0 404 to 3 177 in this work and the consumed o3 toc ratio was established fig s3 it shows that there was no measurable o3 residual for a dosed o3 toc ratio of 0 404 consumed o3 toc dosed o3 toc suggesting that all the o3 was consumed during the iod phase of o3 for o3 toc ratios of 0 574 and 0 879 there were measurable o3 residuals indicating the dosed amounts were equal to or higher than the iod for o3 toc ratios of 1 298 1 871 and 3 177 the o3 dose clearly exceeded the iod meanwhile a relationship of dosed o3 toc ratio to o3 residual during the iod phase 30 s was considered fig s4 at o3 toc ratios of 0 574 the o3 residual concentrations was 1 mg l suggesting the o3 ct values were higher than 0 5 mg min l according to the inactivation of viruses by ozone a ct value of 0 5 mg min l is required at 20 c for 4 log inactivation indicating that a 1 mg l dissolved o3 residual concentration should be obtained after 30 s contact time to guarantee adequate removal efficiency schott 2017 therefore an o3 toc ratio of 0 574 was chosen as the optimized o3 initial concentration to conduct testing so as to guarantee an o3 residual to calculate o3 ct values 2 1 5 bench scale experimental setup bench scale experiments were conducted by changing volume ratios between saturated o3 water and wastewater to achieve various initial o3 toc ratios sodium thiosulfate 0 2 mol l 1 ml sigma aldrich australia was added into the solution mixture to quench o3 at a known contact time to stop further reaction any dilution was considered when analysing all chemical concentration data the optimized o3 toc ratio of 0 574 was used to conduct a series of tests with short to long contact time 0 5 min 1 min 2 min and 4 min to verify the influencing effects of contact time and o3 ct values a series of tests using various o3 toc ratios 0 404 to 3 177 were conducted at a contact time of 30 s and meanwhile various corresponding o3 ct values mg min l were obtained so as to identify the treatment performance using o3 toc ratio o3 ct value and a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value as the critical operational parameters during ozonation 2 2 full scale comparison eastern treatment plant etp schematically shown in fig 1 operates under steady state conditions four samples black arrows in fig 1 namely a secondary effluent after pre ozonation after biological filter and after post ozonation were collected during real plant operation an average o3 dose of 9 7 0 5 mg l was applied in the pre ozonation process to satisfy effluent treatment requirements the average toc value in the raw secondary effluent to ozonation was measured as 11 0 mg l this corresponds to a mass based o3 toc ratio of 0 833 0 046 it should be noted that the secondary effluent taken for bench scale testing had a slightly higher toc 14 47 mg l than that for full scale comparison this was considered within normal variances for the plant for post ozonation an average o3 concentration of 4 7 0 5 mg l was dosed in the process mainly for the pathogens inactivation a minimum lrv of 0 8 for cryptosporidium was set as the treatment requirement as such the o3 ct value of between 4 14 and 4 99 are required when assuming a water temperature of 15 17 c the usepa lt2eswtr inactivation relationship log credit 0 0397 1 09757temp ct usepa 2018 for the biological filter process the plant operates 32 filters with a cross sectional area of 79 m2 per filter the multi media filter uses three layers of media for filtration coal fine garnet and coarse garnet 2 3 quantification of coc all target chemicals in filtered secondary effluents and tertiary treatment effluents were loaded to a solid phase extraction spe disk followed by elution and analysis with gcms shimadzu qp2010 kyoto japan in total ion monitoring tim mode total ion current chromatograms obtained by a gc ms were treated with an automated identification and quantification system database aiqs db method to permit quantification of 949 trace organic chemicals allinson et al 2012 kadokami et al 2005 2 4 chemical classification the classification of coc varies across nations and it is common to use an end use or health response classification approach as is typified by the australian drinking water guidelines adwg nhmrc nrmmc 2018 or australian guidelines for water recycling agwr nrmmc 2008 however based on a mechanistic response to a specific treatment barrier a different classification is implied indeed one that is based on molecular attributes such a classification is expected to be barrier specific one chemical classification in terms of mechanistic response to an ozonation barrier used herein was based on the classification approach of dickenson et al dickenson et al 2009 using a chemical structure analysis and the molecular response to o3 at a high level molecules are classified as class 1 those with electron donating groups edgs e g hydroxyl amine conjugated double bond or sulfide in the structures these have enhanced reactivity with o3 class 2 saturated aliphatic and nitroaromatic compounds class 3 compounds of nitrosamines class 4 those with electron withdrawing groups ewgs e g iodine chlorine fluorine nitro in the structures these are only weakly responsive to oxidation by o3 another classification approach proposed for o3 based systems is where molecules are classified into groupings based on their reaction rate constants with o3 ko3 and the oh radical k oh blackbeard et al 2016 in this assessment five groups are considered and the relationship to the dickenson et al classification is indicated in table 1 the only difference between the two is that the latter requires explicit knowledge of the reaction rate constant of a molecule to o3 and the oh radical there are a very large number of chemicals where this parameter is unknown for which scenario an analysis of the chemical structure is required 2 5 surrogate measurement uv254 agilent cary 60 uv vis spectrophotometer and toc shimadzu toc vws analyzer were measured on both pre treated influents and post treated effluents to explore their potential to be online surrogates in an ozone process to predict the chemical removal 2 6 methods to determine lrv in calculating an lrv removal efficiency for the system a chemical compound that was either not detected or had a concentration less than the limit of reporting lor gc ms aiqs db method in either the pre treated influents or post treated effluents are problematic in terms of reporting in this instance the concentration of the compound in the influent relative to the lor was also deemed relevant whereby a detection ratio concept dr was used the dr is the ratio of compound concentration in the influent to lor dickenson et al 2011 in the case where a compound was not detected in the effluent a value of 0 5 lor is used to replace the non detect zero values for all compounds with a dr 5 however if compounds had a dr 5 an lrv 1 could not be reported and for these compounds the lrv is reported as a minimum since there is no reasonable calculation to show a true value for the barrier removal efficiency 3 results and discussion 3 1 bench scale tests 3 1 1 evaluation of coc removal by ozonation after analysing the filtered secondary effluents used as a feed to the ozone process 58 organic chemical compounds supplementary table s1 s2 were measured out of a possible 949 in the aiqs db analytical method the detected chemicals with known ko3 and k oh were classified based on the two classification approaches and are shown in table 2 3 1 1 1 using ozone contact time the data in tables s1 s2 for coc removal show the concentration changes of coc across the ozone barrier the classes were based on the chemical classification of dickenson et al dickenson et al 2009 table s1 shows all coc with detection ratios drs 5 so as to achieve a potential lrv calculation of 1 to compare the removal efficiency for various contact times and table s2 shows all coc detected in either the influent or post ozone effluent with a detection ratio drs of 5 for these latter compounds it is not possible to provide an accurate indication of the lrv or there is a higher error in the calculated lrv fig 2 show the calculated lrvs for three classes of compounds class 1 2 and 4 using the data in table s1 to aid presentation and interpretation the lrv response is plotted against the molecular weight mw instead of the compound due to their long chemical names the molecular weight and chemical name are listed accordingly in the figures in some instances complete removal of the chemical was achieved for all or at longer contact times it should be noted that the lrv response is plotted on a scale different for each class that reflects the level of removal for that class all coc shown in fig 2 indicated an obvious overall removal trend namely that higher lrvs were achieved with longer contact time in cases where there is no trend with contact time a higher lrv cannot be calculated i e the compound was not detected in the residual and as such the value is a minimum a summary of the structural analysis of the compounds from the three classes of compounds shows class 1 coc containing moieties i e hydroxyl aromatic amino aromatic nonaromatic deprotonated amines alkoxy aromatics sub classes a e were highly amenable to oxidative attack resulting in lrvs 1 with a contact time of 4 min those with an lrv very close to1 had a dr of just less than 5 one compound deet mw of 191 in sub class g showed an lrv of less than 0 8 at this o3 toc dose class 2 coc containing structures of saturated aliphatic moieties including alkene ketone alcohol acid ether or amides showed intermediate removal with most lrvs of 0 5 0 2 for a contact time of 4 min class 4 coc with halogenated aliphatic structures showed poor removal with lrvs of 0 1 or less for all contact times in considering the reaction rate constants with o3 and the oh radicals for the three classes of coc i e the blackbeard et al approach blackbeard et al 2016 coc with high reaction rate constant to o3 ko3 of 105 and high reaction rate constant to the oh radical k oh of 109 such as bisphenol a mw of 228 naproxen and carbamazepine mws of 230 and 236 respectively class 1 showed lrvs 1 and triclosan mw of 288 class 1 showed an lrv of 0 96 a minimum value reported here due to complete removal at short contact times coc with low ko3 but high k oh 109 showed poor to intermediate removal lrv 1 additionally compounds that increased in concentration across the barrier highlighted in green in tables s1 s2 should be considered as the formation of oxidation by products eight compounds were observed to either increase in concentration across the ozone barrier or were not detected in the influent but were detected post ozone for example di isobutyl phthalate dimethyl phthalate and butyl benzyl phthalate showed an increase in concentration after ozonation table s3 shows all phthalate compounds detected in this study and the concentration changes across the ozone barrier and detailed chemical structures dicyclohexyl phthalate bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate and di n octyl phthalate with long hydrocarbon chains connected to a carboxyl group showed a decrease in concentration with ozonation however dimethyl phthalate di n butyl phthalate di isobutyl phthalate and butyl benzyl phthalate with short hydrocarbon chains showed a concentration increase after ozonation this suggests the possible mechanistic decomposition from long chain molecules to short chain molecules by the oxidative attack of o3 or the oh radical von gunten 2003 however for butyl benzyl phthalate there is no obvious link to a precursor chemical suggesting that the precursor chemical is not included in the aiqs db analytical method 3 1 1 2 using o3 toc ratio table 3 shows the concentration changes of coc detected in the influent and post ozone effluents at various o3 toc ratios these coc are organic compounds known to react rapidly with o3 and the oh radical or react slowly with o3 but react rapidly with the oh radical the extent of removal of compounds with different reaction rate constants to o3 and the oh radical is shown in fig 3 for o3 toc ratio instantaneous ozone demand iod o3 toc 0 404 coc removal by direct reaction with o3 there is little formation of the oh radical to react with organic chemicals unselectively only triclosan bisphenol a carbamazepine and naproxen with high ko3 showed lrvs of around 1 or greater it is possible that the lrv for triclosan would be greater since the detection ratio dr is just 5 for this compound therefore the true response of triclosan as a function of o3 toc ratio is not able to be evaluated for o3 toc ratio iod o3 toc 0 574 0 879 close to iod oh radical formation is expected during the iod phase and some resistant compounds showed a higher removal efficiency examples include deet class 1 sub class g tep class 2 tcpp 2 class 4 however the lrvs are still 1 for o3 toc ratio iod o3 toc ratio 1 298 compounds like deet class 1 sub class g showed much higher removal with an lrv 1 for an o3 toc ratio 1 298 and tep tcpp 1 class 2 and tcpp 2 class 4 showed lrvs 0 5 for an o3 toc ratio 3 177 however compounds such as simazine and tcep both class 4 still showed low lrvs even when the o3 toc ratio was much higher than the iod indicating their strong resistance to both o3 and the oh radical 3 1 1 3 using o3 ct value fig 4 show the assessment results of coc removal through a o3 ct tool the results show that barrier performance is closely dependant on the reaction rate constants of coc with o3 and the oh radical for coc with reaction rate constant to o3 ko3 of 105 m 1 s 1 and reaction rate to the oh radical k oh of 109 m 1 s 1 fig 4 a a measurable o3 ct of 0 063 0 839 mg min l achieved lrvs of 1 group 1 blackbeard et al class 1 sub class a c dickenson et al for coc with low ko3 and high k oh oh selective compounds fig 4 b the o3 ct tool is not useful to assess a series of compounds in this case a dickenson et al structural mechanistic approach is more useful 3 1 1 4 using a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value fig 5 shows data for removal of coc with both high ko3 and k oh and low ko3 but high k oh the data are for an assessment by using a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value as an example an o3 ct value of 0 09 mg min l and 0 2 mg min l can be obtained by using different o3 toc ratios for compounds with a high ko3 fig 5 a c there was no difference between the measured lrvs for all compounds except bisphenol a irrespective of the mode of comparison be it o3 ct value fig 5 a or o3 toc ratio fig 5 c since the data indicates that these compounds showed complete removal for bisphenol a an o3 toc ratio of 0 461 with a ct value of 0 087 or an o3 toc ratio of 0 879 with a ct value of 0 063 was required to achieve a complete removal for compounds with a low ko3 fig 5 b d no consistent trend was observed as a function of increasing o3 ct fig 5 b similarly analysing the data as a function of increasing o3 toc ratio also resulted in no observable trend except for the case of deet which showed a smooth increase in removal fig 5 d for an o3 toc ratio of 0 0574 deet showed very similar lrvs at different o3 ct values this suggests that just the o3 ct value or just the o3 toc ratio is not a consistent tool to act as predictive criteria for most compounds with a low reaction rate constant with o3 for all compounds it is demonstrated in fig 5 that conditions of both high o3 ct and o3 toc ratio gave higher lrvs for all compounds even ozone resistant coc 3 1 2 surrogates of uv254 and toc fig 6 shows the observed decreases in uv254 and toc with the removal of all 58compounds detected in the pre ozone feed the data are for the broad range of bench scale tests including various o3 toc ratios and ozone contact times the data show linear correlations r2 0 9 between the two parameters and overall compound removal and demonstrates that changes in uv254 and toc are potentially good surrogates to assess barrier integrity 3 2 full scale validation a total of 64 organic chemical compounds were measured out from the secondary effluent the data in tables s4 s5 show the concentration changes of coc across the ozone and biological filter barriers in full scale operation the chemicals were based on the same classifications with the bench scale testing analysis table s4 shows all coc with detection ratios dr 5 so as to achieve a calculable lrv to validate the removal efficiency table s5 shows all detected coc in either the secondary effluent or tertiary treatment effluents with a dr 5 the compounds in table s5 were ignored for lrv calculation 3 2 1 overall assessment of chemical removal fig 7 shows the calculated lrvs for the three classes class 1 2 and 4 coc across the three barriers using the data from table s4 analysis of the data from full scale operations indicated that the removal of coc were similar to the removal tendencies of the three classes obtained in bench scale results lrvs for the highly susceptible class 1 compounds were consistent with bench scale results where the lrvs were almost 1 post ozonation 0 5 lrvs 1 0 was obtained for compounds in class 2 post ozonation 0 1 lrvs 0 5 was indicated for class 4 compounds post ozonation this result highlights the potential to use a classification of compounds within a chemical credit framework to evaluate the removal tendency of compounds based on a chemical structural analysis it should be noted that the negative scale in fig 7 indicates the formation of oxidation by products in some instances these compounds were then removed in the subsequent biological filter barrier compounds such as acetophenone methyl myristate methyl palmitate 2 butoxyethanol octanol and tonalide in class 2 tables s4 s5 showed an increase in concentration after ozonation these are mostly biodegradable compounds of aldehydes ketones or acids from microorganisms previous studies escobar and randall 2001 have demonstrated that assimilable organic carbon aoc the fraction of total organic carbon utilized by bacteria could be significantly increased through the ozonation process and a common operation is to use biological filters to remove the aoc prior to the next treatment barrier janssens et al 1985 van der kooij et al 1989 the removal performance of the three classes of coc by the biological filters at full scale is shown in fig 7 a 0 0 5 lrv removal was observed for 60 class 1 compounds a 0 5 lrv removal for 60 class 2 compounds and a 0 1 0 2 lrv for 60 class 4 compounds the results confirm the efficiency of biological filters for assimilable compound removal particularly biodegradable compounds associated with class 2 good removal lrv of order 0 5 was obtained for molecules in sub class a e of class 1 but lower lrvs for the more recalcitrant class 2 and 4 compounds overall the data shows the very high susceptibility of compounds with edgs to a combination barrier of ozonation and biological filtration 3 2 2 removal validation using o3 toc ratio fig 8 shows a comparison of the removal performance of full scale operations across the pre ozonation barrier with bench scale testing at an equivalent o3 toc ratio 0 833 at full scale as against 0 879 at bench scale coc removal in full scale operations was lower on average than bench scale results 50 coc in class 1 had removals of 0 2 lrv lower at full scale than at bench scale in class 2 69 coc had removals of 0 1 lrv lower at full scale than at bench scale and 30 coc showed lower lrvs of 0 2 at full scale than at bench scale 40 coc in class 4 had lower lrvs of 0 1 at full scale than at bench scale the first obvious difference between full and bench scale operations other than the obvious scale of activities is that the o3 ct is unknown for full scale operations since the ozone residual is not a measurable parameter after the first ozonation barrier it is monitored after the second ozonation step since this is an important control parameter for pathogen inactivation for the bench scale results the o3 ct value was 0 063 mg min l therefore a combined knowledge of not just the o3 toc ratio but also the o3 ct value is indicated to be important to control coc removal furthermore when looking into the coc in each class half of the compounds in class 1 showed lrvs of 0 2 lower at full scale than at bench scale these are fast reacting chemicals with high reaction rate constants to o3 and their lrvs are closely related to the contact time the full scale plant operates in plug flow resulting in a distribution of contact times of a chemical to o3 this is clearly quite different to the complete mixing used in bench scale tests therefore some chemicals will pass through the contact tank in a period much shorter than the mean contact time in terms of coc in class 2 and 4 most are slightly recalcitrant to reaction with the oh radical which is less selective and occurs in the first 30 s wert et al 2009 it is interesting to note that the differences for removal of these coc were lower in absolute terms another potential difference between full and bench scale operations was the pre filtration of secondary effluent as a feed to the ozone barrier using glass microfiber filters for the bench scale tests the filtration aim was to weaken the effects of microorganism on chemical removal during refrigeration since it takes time to complete the series of bench scale tests it has been measured that a slight decrease 0 91 mg l in toc was observed for secondary effluent after filtration in the laboratory therefore a combination of plug flow versus well mixed and a higher toc non filtration of the secondary effluent in full scale operations could easily account for the observed differences meanwhile the operational temperatures at the time of sampling between full and bench scale had some differences as well as to sampling the water was collected in march autumn in the southern hemisphere for bench scale test and in august winter for full scale validation the difference in temperature was of order 5 c gardoni et al gardoni et al 2012 specified that in ozonation process temperature affects direct ozone reactions significantly more than oh radical reactions based on this we would expect to see a larger difference for class 1 molecule removals compared to class 2 and 4 between laboratory scale and full scale testing 3 2 3 removal validation using a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value fig 9 compares the removal performance of compounds under full scale operational conditions o3 toc ratio of 0 883 and unknown o3 ct value to bench scale results lower o3 toc ratio of 0 574 at various known o3 ct values for an o3 ct value of 0 079 at bench scale 60 compound removals were equal or lower than full scale for o3 ct values of 0 095 at bench scale 80 compounds showed higher lrvs than full scale for an o3 ct value of 0 409 at bench scale 93 compounds showed higher lrvs than full scale apart from the potential operational differences discussed above between bench and full scale to cause the resulting differences this result also suggests there is potential to obtain the same or better removal performance at a lower o3 toc ratio with a higher o3 ct value than just using a high o3 toc ratio given the high capital and operational cost of o3 generation a decrease of the o3 toc ratio but an increase in o3 ct values is indicated it is quite obviously difficult to increase the real contact time of all chemicals to o3 in a full scale system with plug flow operation the comparison of results from full scale and bench scale testing confirms a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value as a critical criterion to the removal of coc in a predictable manner excellent agreement between the bench and full scale results for uv254 and toc analysis has been demonstrated in fig s5 highlighting the potential for a range of real time surrogates to predict the removal efficiency of all detected compounds in class 1 2 and 4 to real plant scale operations and act as an additional integrity measure however in various systems there may be a certain amount of inherent variability in these relationship models but other literature indicated that the pilot and full scale validation efforts demonstrate that the models are robust gerrity et al 2012 conclusions a chemical credit framework to predict the coc removal from water in an ozone process has been established in this study this framework in the first instance combines both an o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value as operating monitoring parameters with the development of chemical classifications according to mechanisms of removal as defined through the susceptibility to ozone of specific chemical structures overall 1 in examining the o3 toc ratio or o3 ct value effects on coc removal the results show an obvious trend to coc classified by reaction rate constants to o3 and the oh radical coc with ko3 105 m 1 s 1 and k oh 109 m 1 s 1 showed an lrv of 1 for all o3 toc ratios 0 574 or o3 ct values 0 063 coc with ko3 10 m 1 s 1 but k oh 109 showed medium to poor removal even when the o3 toc ratio i e 3 177 or o3 ct value i e 0 839 was high 2 in considering the potential to use broad chemical structural classifications and performance criteria of o3 toc ratio and the o3 ct value the results indicate this to be viable whereby for coc with ko3 105 m 1 s 1 and k oh 109 m 1 s 1 an o3 toc ratio of 0 461 or a measurable o3 ct of 0 063 mg min l can achieve lrvs of 1 these are chemicals with aromatics structures for coc with low ko3 and high koh oh selective compounds only an o3 toc ratio or an o3 ct tool is not useful for an individual chemical a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value inclusive of coc structural classification approach is indicated as necessary criteria 3 furthermore in view of the chemical credit framework measurement of uv254 and toc were tested as potential additional on line surrogates of ozone barrier integrity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

15029,ozonation is an effective barrier for removing a wide spectrum of organic chemicals of concern coc in a water treatment process in this study bench and full scale tests were conducted on a secondary treated effluent at the eastern treatment plant etp of melbourne water to probe the performance of ozonation in removing coc in a wastewater discharge from the secondary treated effluent as the feed to the ozone process 58 organic chemicals were measured out of a possible 949 compounds by using the aiqs db analytical method a chemical credit framework for the ozonation process has been established according to the bench scale results chemical classifications based on the chemical structures aromatics aliphatic and halogenated aliphatic compounds and reaction rate constants with o3 ko3 and the oh radical k oh and a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value as operating parameters were confirmed to be useful and important in determining whether a chemical would be removed by ozone it is shown that an o3 toc ratio of 0 404 was shown to be necessary to overcome the instantaneous ozone demand iod to guarantee enough ozone to oxidise coc for coc with ko3 105 m 1 s 1 and k oh 109 m 1 s 1 an o3 toc ratio of 0 461 or a measurable o3 ct of 0 063 mg min l can achieve log reduction values lrvs of 1 these are chemicals with aromatic structures for coc with low ko3 and high koh a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value inclusive of a chemical structure classification is indicated as necessary criteria to evaluate the removal uv254 and toc were demonstrated to be good online surrogates of ozone barrier performance in the absence of continuous o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value measurements full scale operational results confirm the effective predictions of the chemical credit framework which highlights the necessity and importance of monitoring both the o3 toc ratio and o3 ct values to predict the removal efficiency of a given chemical with a known response to o3 or a known chemical

available on request 1 introduction ozonation is reported as an effective barrier for pathogen inactivation zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 and organic chemicals of concern coc removal from wastewater blackbeard et al 2016 dickenson et al 2009 wert et al 2009 in the case of pathogen inactivation a risk based approach namely critical control point approach has been developed and used to manage ozone operations it includes critical operating parameters and assigned log reduction value lrv credits for a particular pathogen as such the performance of pathogen inactivation by an ozone barrier can be operated in a predictive manner nhmrc nrmmc 2018 nrmmc 2008 usepa 2018 vicdoh 2013 as to chemical removal o3 has been demonstrated to react with organic chemicals in an aqueous system through direct action of molecular o3 or through the action of induced free radicals mainly hydroxyl oh radicals altmann et al 2014 gottschalk et al 2009 molecular o3 is a selective electrophile that reacts quickly to chemicals with electron donating groups edg e g conjugated double bonds activated aromatic systems and deprotonated amines these preferred reaction pathways allow an assessment of the likelihood of o3 reacting with a particular coc dickenson et al 2009 michael and von gunten 1999 von gunten 2003 however the oh radical is known to react less selectively with chemicals than molecular o3 and provides an opportunity to oxidise those chemical compounds that are recalcitrant to o3 michael and von gunten 1999 analogous to the pathogen risks there are an increasing number and diversity of chemical contaminants nhmrc nrmmc 2018 one approach that allows chemical contaminants to develop mechanistically relevant barrier credits is to focus on the chemical characteristics to the key removal mechanisms with the consideration of critical operating parameters in the ozone barrier according to the mechanistic response to ozone barrier dickenson et al dickenson et al 2009 has developed a chemical classification approach by using a chemical structure analysis and the molecular response to o3 blackbeard et al blackbeard et al 2016 has proposed another chemical classification approach based on chemical s reaction rate constants with o3 and the oh radical but the relationship between the two classifications hasn t been developed buffle et al buffle et al 2006 and wert et al wert et al 2009 have indicated the significant impacts of the operational parameters of dosed ozone and total organic carbon ratio o3 toc ratio and ozone o3 residual concentration by time ct value o3 ct mg min l on molecular o3 decomposition and oh radical production and hence significant influences on chemical removal however in the existing ozone studies there is still not an assessment of chemical removal using a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value as operating parameters additionally during the barrier operation a dominant issue is the high cost of analytical testing of coc to ensure that these contaminants are removed to below guideline levels scales et al 2019 a surrogate parameter tailored to monitor the removal performance of risks across a barrier is commonly utilized nhmrc nrmmc 2018 in terms of the coc removal through an ozonation process a surrogate parameter is often a quantifiable change of a bulk parameter that can serve as a performance measure of a barrier in controlling the removal of a group of coc drewes et al 2009 dickenson et al dickenson et al 2009 demonstrated the possibility of using changes of ultraviolet absorbence at 254 nm uv254 as a surrogate parameter to assess the removal efficiency of trace organic chemicals from the chemical structure therefore the development of a risk based credit framework to predict the removal efficiency of coc is the objective of this study the exploration of appropriate parameters as the surrogate to validate the ozone performance and the consideration of a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value as critical operating parameters during the ozonation process are of interest herein this includes an understanding of the correlation between the diverse reaction mechanisms elucidated for the coc reaction with molecular o3 or the oh radical at a known ozone dose condition and chemical structure in the reclamation of wastewater it is common to use secondary treated wastewater effluent as a feed for a further treatment process to produce reclaimed water northcott et al 2015 sarkis et al 2013 eastern treatment plant etp operated by melbourne water melbourne australia treats nearly 330 million litres melbourne s sewage per day and uses an intensive three stage treatment process including primary treatment secondary treatment and tertiary treatment blackbeard et al 2016 it has several functional barriers including pre ozonation biological filtration post ozonation ultraviolet uv disinfection and chlorination cl2 this study provides a bench scale experimental assessment of the ozone barrier for coc removal from the secondary effluent of etp and the data is compared directly to full scale operations it includes the classification of compounds detected in the effluents according to the chemical structure and the selection of compounds to serve as target chemical indicators according to their designation as fast reacting or slow reacting with o3 and the oh radical so as to compare their removal and define the removal mechanisms of a chemical by ozone it also assesses the influencing factors that may affect coc removal performance including short to long o3 contact time low to high dosed o3 toc ratios and various achieved o3 ct values mg min l at the core of the assessment is the potential of a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value to act as the operating criteria to monitor removal performance during the operation additionally the study proposes a prediction and management process for the etp full scale ozone operations with proposed barrier credits for a range of classes of chemicals the application to all ozone barriers is then considered including potential control strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 bench scale tests 2 1 1 wastewater samples and preparation wastewater samples were collected from the eastern treatment plant etp melbourne australia samples for bench scale tests were secondary effluent prior to injection of o3 the sampling point is indicated in fig 1 40 l of wastewater was collected with sampling containers these containers were precleaned with methanol milli q water and then dried prior to use and were rinsed with water sample during the sampling process all collected samples were transported on ice to the laboratory samples for assessment of full scale performance were collected from the points as indicated in fig 1 once wastewater samples arrived in the laboratory they were filtered under vacuum using glass microfiber filters with 1 2 μm pore size whatman 1822 047 gf c sigma aldrich australia filtered samples were refrigerated at 4 c prior to subsequent measurement the coarse pore size filtration was intended to remove only large debris such like microorganisms from the sample 2 1 2 ozone determination in water ozone saturation and residual concentrations in water were determined based on the apha standard method 4500 o3 using indigo trisulfonate solution its sigma aldrich australia apha awwa wef 1992 bader and hoigné 1981 an agilent cary 60 uv vis spectrophotometer santa clara usa was used for analysis 2 1 3 generation of saturated ozone water an ozone generator a2z ozone system inc australia was used to generate o3 at a rate of 13 g h by using compressed oxygen o3 was injected into milli q water for a minimum time 20 min t 20 c to generate saturated o3 water fig s1 this was determined by the variation of three consecutive o3 concentration measurements according to the apha standard method 4500 o3 so as to be in a range of 10 every 5 min the o3 saturation concentration in milli q water was measured to be between 16 0 and 19 1 mg l at room temperature t 20 c 2 1 4 determination of dosed o3 toc ratio in order to determine the dosed o3 toc ratios used in the bench scale tests natural ozone decay tests were conducted using milli q water to determine the spontaneous o3 decomposition characteristics without coc the results fig s2 show that the dissolved o3 residual had a half life of approximately 30 min in milli q water it should be noted that this natural o3 decay in milli q water needs to be added into the calculation of o3 decomposition in wastewater samples during coc removal in water by ozone o3 decomposition that takes place within the initial 30 s of ozonation can be referred as the instantaneous ozone demand iod usually the iod can be calculated based on the transferred o3 dose and dissolved o3 residual observed after 30 s to provide an understanding of o3 reactivity at a known concentration or oh radical reactivity at an unknown concentration also it has been shown that significant oh radical formation occurs during the iod initial 30 s wert et al 2009 a relationship between the dosed o3 toc ratio 0 404 to 3 177 in this work and the consumed o3 toc ratio was established fig s3 it shows that there was no measurable o3 residual for a dosed o3 toc ratio of 0 404 consumed o3 toc dosed o3 toc suggesting that all the o3 was consumed during the iod phase of o3 for o3 toc ratios of 0 574 and 0 879 there were measurable o3 residuals indicating the dosed amounts were equal to or higher than the iod for o3 toc ratios of 1 298 1 871 and 3 177 the o3 dose clearly exceeded the iod meanwhile a relationship of dosed o3 toc ratio to o3 residual during the iod phase 30 s was considered fig s4 at o3 toc ratios of 0 574 the o3 residual concentrations was 1 mg l suggesting the o3 ct values were higher than 0 5 mg min l according to the inactivation of viruses by ozone a ct value of 0 5 mg min l is required at 20 c for 4 log inactivation indicating that a 1 mg l dissolved o3 residual concentration should be obtained after 30 s contact time to guarantee adequate removal efficiency schott 2017 therefore an o3 toc ratio of 0 574 was chosen as the optimized o3 initial concentration to conduct testing so as to guarantee an o3 residual to calculate o3 ct values 2 1 5 bench scale experimental setup bench scale experiments were conducted by changing volume ratios between saturated o3 water and wastewater to achieve various initial o3 toc ratios sodium thiosulfate 0 2 mol l 1 ml sigma aldrich australia was added into the solution mixture to quench o3 at a known contact time to stop further reaction any dilution was considered when analysing all chemical concentration data the optimized o3 toc ratio of 0 574 was used to conduct a series of tests with short to long contact time 0 5 min 1 min 2 min and 4 min to verify the influencing effects of contact time and o3 ct values a series of tests using various o3 toc ratios 0 404 to 3 177 were conducted at a contact time of 30 s and meanwhile various corresponding o3 ct values mg min l were obtained so as to identify the treatment performance using o3 toc ratio o3 ct value and a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value as the critical operational parameters during ozonation 2 2 full scale comparison eastern treatment plant etp schematically shown in fig 1 operates under steady state conditions four samples black arrows in fig 1 namely a secondary effluent after pre ozonation after biological filter and after post ozonation were collected during real plant operation an average o3 dose of 9 7 0 5 mg l was applied in the pre ozonation process to satisfy effluent treatment requirements the average toc value in the raw secondary effluent to ozonation was measured as 11 0 mg l this corresponds to a mass based o3 toc ratio of 0 833 0 046 it should be noted that the secondary effluent taken for bench scale testing had a slightly higher toc 14 47 mg l than that for full scale comparison this was considered within normal variances for the plant for post ozonation an average o3 concentration of 4 7 0 5 mg l was dosed in the process mainly for the pathogens inactivation a minimum lrv of 0 8 for cryptosporidium was set as the treatment requirement as such the o3 ct value of between 4 14 and 4 99 are required when assuming a water temperature of 15 17 c the usepa lt2eswtr inactivation relationship log credit 0 0397 1 09757temp ct usepa 2018 for the biological filter process the plant operates 32 filters with a cross sectional area of 79 m2 per filter the multi media filter uses three layers of media for filtration coal fine garnet and coarse garnet 2 3 quantification of coc all target chemicals in filtered secondary effluents and tertiary treatment effluents were loaded to a solid phase extraction spe disk followed by elution and analysis with gcms shimadzu qp2010 kyoto japan in total ion monitoring tim mode total ion current chromatograms obtained by a gc ms were treated with an automated identification and quantification system database aiqs db method to permit quantification of 949 trace organic chemicals allinson et al 2012 kadokami et al 2005 2 4 chemical classification the classification of coc varies across nations and it is common to use an end use or health response classification approach as is typified by the australian drinking water guidelines adwg nhmrc nrmmc 2018 or australian guidelines for water recycling agwr nrmmc 2008 however based on a mechanistic response to a specific treatment barrier a different classification is implied indeed one that is based on molecular attributes such a classification is expected to be barrier specific one chemical classification in terms of mechanistic response to an ozonation barrier used herein was based on the classification approach of dickenson et al dickenson et al 2009 using a chemical structure analysis and the molecular response to o3 at a high level molecules are classified as class 1 those with electron donating groups edgs e g hydroxyl amine conjugated double bond or sulfide in the structures these have enhanced reactivity with o3 class 2 saturated aliphatic and nitroaromatic compounds class 3 compounds of nitrosamines class 4 those with electron withdrawing groups ewgs e g iodine chlorine fluorine nitro in the structures these are only weakly responsive to oxidation by o3 another classification approach proposed for o3 based systems is where molecules are classified into groupings based on their reaction rate constants with o3 ko3 and the oh radical k oh blackbeard et al 2016 in this assessment five groups are considered and the relationship to the dickenson et al classification is indicated in table 1 the only difference between the two is that the latter requires explicit knowledge of the reaction rate constant of a molecule to o3 and the oh radical there are a very large number of chemicals where this parameter is unknown for which scenario an analysis of the chemical structure is required 2 5 surrogate measurement uv254 agilent cary 60 uv vis spectrophotometer and toc shimadzu toc vws analyzer were measured on both pre treated influents and post treated effluents to explore their potential to be online surrogates in an ozone process to predict the chemical removal 2 6 methods to determine lrv in calculating an lrv removal efficiency for the system a chemical compound that was either not detected or had a concentration less than the limit of reporting lor gc ms aiqs db method in either the pre treated influents or post treated effluents are problematic in terms of reporting in this instance the concentration of the compound in the influent relative to the lor was also deemed relevant whereby a detection ratio concept dr was used the dr is the ratio of compound concentration in the influent to lor dickenson et al 2011 in the case where a compound was not detected in the effluent a value of 0 5 lor is used to replace the non detect zero values for all compounds with a dr 5 however if compounds had a dr 5 an lrv 1 could not be reported and for these compounds the lrv is reported as a minimum since there is no reasonable calculation to show a true value for the barrier removal efficiency 3 results and discussion 3 1 bench scale tests 3 1 1 evaluation of coc removal by ozonation after analysing the filtered secondary effluents used as a feed to the ozone process 58 organic chemical compounds supplementary table s1 s2 were measured out of a possible 949 in the aiqs db analytical method the detected chemicals with known ko3 and k oh were classified based on the two classification approaches and are shown in table 2 3 1 1 1 using ozone contact time the data in tables s1 s2 for coc removal show the concentration changes of coc across the ozone barrier the classes were based on the chemical classification of dickenson et al dickenson et al 2009 table s1 shows all coc with detection ratios drs 5 so as to achieve a potential lrv calculation of 1 to compare the removal efficiency for various contact times and table s2 shows all coc detected in either the influent or post ozone effluent with a detection ratio drs of 5 for these latter compounds it is not possible to provide an accurate indication of the lrv or there is a higher error in the calculated lrv fig 2 show the calculated lrvs for three classes of compounds class 1 2 and 4 using the data in table s1 to aid presentation and interpretation the lrv response is plotted against the molecular weight mw instead of the compound due to their long chemical names the molecular weight and chemical name are listed accordingly in the figures in some instances complete removal of the chemical was achieved for all or at longer contact times it should be noted that the lrv response is plotted on a scale different for each class that reflects the level of removal for that class all coc shown in fig 2 indicated an obvious overall removal trend namely that higher lrvs were achieved with longer contact time in cases where there is no trend with contact time a higher lrv cannot be calculated i e the compound was not detected in the residual and as such the value is a minimum a summary of the structural analysis of the compounds from the three classes of compounds shows class 1 coc containing moieties i e hydroxyl aromatic amino aromatic nonaromatic deprotonated amines alkoxy aromatics sub classes a e were highly amenable to oxidative attack resulting in lrvs 1 with a contact time of 4 min those with an lrv very close to1 had a dr of just less than 5 one compound deet mw of 191 in sub class g showed an lrv of less than 0 8 at this o3 toc dose class 2 coc containing structures of saturated aliphatic moieties including alkene ketone alcohol acid ether or amides showed intermediate removal with most lrvs of 0 5 0 2 for a contact time of 4 min class 4 coc with halogenated aliphatic structures showed poor removal with lrvs of 0 1 or less for all contact times in considering the reaction rate constants with o3 and the oh radicals for the three classes of coc i e the blackbeard et al approach blackbeard et al 2016 coc with high reaction rate constant to o3 ko3 of 105 and high reaction rate constant to the oh radical k oh of 109 such as bisphenol a mw of 228 naproxen and carbamazepine mws of 230 and 236 respectively class 1 showed lrvs 1 and triclosan mw of 288 class 1 showed an lrv of 0 96 a minimum value reported here due to complete removal at short contact times coc with low ko3 but high k oh 109 showed poor to intermediate removal lrv 1 additionally compounds that increased in concentration across the barrier highlighted in green in tables s1 s2 should be considered as the formation of oxidation by products eight compounds were observed to either increase in concentration across the ozone barrier or were not detected in the influent but were detected post ozone for example di isobutyl phthalate dimethyl phthalate and butyl benzyl phthalate showed an increase in concentration after ozonation table s3 shows all phthalate compounds detected in this study and the concentration changes across the ozone barrier and detailed chemical structures dicyclohexyl phthalate bis 2 ethylhexyl phthalate and di n octyl phthalate with long hydrocarbon chains connected to a carboxyl group showed a decrease in concentration with ozonation however dimethyl phthalate di n butyl phthalate di isobutyl phthalate and butyl benzyl phthalate with short hydrocarbon chains showed a concentration increase after ozonation this suggests the possible mechanistic decomposition from long chain molecules to short chain molecules by the oxidative attack of o3 or the oh radical von gunten 2003 however for butyl benzyl phthalate there is no obvious link to a precursor chemical suggesting that the precursor chemical is not included in the aiqs db analytical method 3 1 1 2 using o3 toc ratio table 3 shows the concentration changes of coc detected in the influent and post ozone effluents at various o3 toc ratios these coc are organic compounds known to react rapidly with o3 and the oh radical or react slowly with o3 but react rapidly with the oh radical the extent of removal of compounds with different reaction rate constants to o3 and the oh radical is shown in fig 3 for o3 toc ratio instantaneous ozone demand iod o3 toc 0 404 coc removal by direct reaction with o3 there is little formation of the oh radical to react with organic chemicals unselectively only triclosan bisphenol a carbamazepine and naproxen with high ko3 showed lrvs of around 1 or greater it is possible that the lrv for triclosan would be greater since the detection ratio dr is just 5 for this compound therefore the true response of triclosan as a function of o3 toc ratio is not able to be evaluated for o3 toc ratio iod o3 toc 0 574 0 879 close to iod oh radical formation is expected during the iod phase and some resistant compounds showed a higher removal efficiency examples include deet class 1 sub class g tep class 2 tcpp 2 class 4 however the lrvs are still 1 for o3 toc ratio iod o3 toc ratio 1 298 compounds like deet class 1 sub class g showed much higher removal with an lrv 1 for an o3 toc ratio 1 298 and tep tcpp 1 class 2 and tcpp 2 class 4 showed lrvs 0 5 for an o3 toc ratio 3 177 however compounds such as simazine and tcep both class 4 still showed low lrvs even when the o3 toc ratio was much higher than the iod indicating their strong resistance to both o3 and the oh radical 3 1 1 3 using o3 ct value fig 4 show the assessment results of coc removal through a o3 ct tool the results show that barrier performance is closely dependant on the reaction rate constants of coc with o3 and the oh radical for coc with reaction rate constant to o3 ko3 of 105 m 1 s 1 and reaction rate to the oh radical k oh of 109 m 1 s 1 fig 4 a a measurable o3 ct of 0 063 0 839 mg min l achieved lrvs of 1 group 1 blackbeard et al class 1 sub class a c dickenson et al for coc with low ko3 and high k oh oh selective compounds fig 4 b the o3 ct tool is not useful to assess a series of compounds in this case a dickenson et al structural mechanistic approach is more useful 3 1 1 4 using a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value fig 5 shows data for removal of coc with both high ko3 and k oh and low ko3 but high k oh the data are for an assessment by using a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value as an example an o3 ct value of 0 09 mg min l and 0 2 mg min l can be obtained by using different o3 toc ratios for compounds with a high ko3 fig 5 a c there was no difference between the measured lrvs for all compounds except bisphenol a irrespective of the mode of comparison be it o3 ct value fig 5 a or o3 toc ratio fig 5 c since the data indicates that these compounds showed complete removal for bisphenol a an o3 toc ratio of 0 461 with a ct value of 0 087 or an o3 toc ratio of 0 879 with a ct value of 0 063 was required to achieve a complete removal for compounds with a low ko3 fig 5 b d no consistent trend was observed as a function of increasing o3 ct fig 5 b similarly analysing the data as a function of increasing o3 toc ratio also resulted in no observable trend except for the case of deet which showed a smooth increase in removal fig 5 d for an o3 toc ratio of 0 0574 deet showed very similar lrvs at different o3 ct values this suggests that just the o3 ct value or just the o3 toc ratio is not a consistent tool to act as predictive criteria for most compounds with a low reaction rate constant with o3 for all compounds it is demonstrated in fig 5 that conditions of both high o3 ct and o3 toc ratio gave higher lrvs for all compounds even ozone resistant coc 3 1 2 surrogates of uv254 and toc fig 6 shows the observed decreases in uv254 and toc with the removal of all 58compounds detected in the pre ozone feed the data are for the broad range of bench scale tests including various o3 toc ratios and ozone contact times the data show linear correlations r2 0 9 between the two parameters and overall compound removal and demonstrates that changes in uv254 and toc are potentially good surrogates to assess barrier integrity 3 2 full scale validation a total of 64 organic chemical compounds were measured out from the secondary effluent the data in tables s4 s5 show the concentration changes of coc across the ozone and biological filter barriers in full scale operation the chemicals were based on the same classifications with the bench scale testing analysis table s4 shows all coc with detection ratios dr 5 so as to achieve a calculable lrv to validate the removal efficiency table s5 shows all detected coc in either the secondary effluent or tertiary treatment effluents with a dr 5 the compounds in table s5 were ignored for lrv calculation 3 2 1 overall assessment of chemical removal fig 7 shows the calculated lrvs for the three classes class 1 2 and 4 coc across the three barriers using the data from table s4 analysis of the data from full scale operations indicated that the removal of coc were similar to the removal tendencies of the three classes obtained in bench scale results lrvs for the highly susceptible class 1 compounds were consistent with bench scale results where the lrvs were almost 1 post ozonation 0 5 lrvs 1 0 was obtained for compounds in class 2 post ozonation 0 1 lrvs 0 5 was indicated for class 4 compounds post ozonation this result highlights the potential to use a classification of compounds within a chemical credit framework to evaluate the removal tendency of compounds based on a chemical structural analysis it should be noted that the negative scale in fig 7 indicates the formation of oxidation by products in some instances these compounds were then removed in the subsequent biological filter barrier compounds such as acetophenone methyl myristate methyl palmitate 2 butoxyethanol octanol and tonalide in class 2 tables s4 s5 showed an increase in concentration after ozonation these are mostly biodegradable compounds of aldehydes ketones or acids from microorganisms previous studies escobar and randall 2001 have demonstrated that assimilable organic carbon aoc the fraction of total organic carbon utilized by bacteria could be significantly increased through the ozonation process and a common operation is to use biological filters to remove the aoc prior to the next treatment barrier janssens et al 1985 van der kooij et al 1989 the removal performance of the three classes of coc by the biological filters at full scale is shown in fig 7 a 0 0 5 lrv removal was observed for 60 class 1 compounds a 0 5 lrv removal for 60 class 2 compounds and a 0 1 0 2 lrv for 60 class 4 compounds the results confirm the efficiency of biological filters for assimilable compound removal particularly biodegradable compounds associated with class 2 good removal lrv of order 0 5 was obtained for molecules in sub class a e of class 1 but lower lrvs for the more recalcitrant class 2 and 4 compounds overall the data shows the very high susceptibility of compounds with edgs to a combination barrier of ozonation and biological filtration 3 2 2 removal validation using o3 toc ratio fig 8 shows a comparison of the removal performance of full scale operations across the pre ozonation barrier with bench scale testing at an equivalent o3 toc ratio 0 833 at full scale as against 0 879 at bench scale coc removal in full scale operations was lower on average than bench scale results 50 coc in class 1 had removals of 0 2 lrv lower at full scale than at bench scale in class 2 69 coc had removals of 0 1 lrv lower at full scale than at bench scale and 30 coc showed lower lrvs of 0 2 at full scale than at bench scale 40 coc in class 4 had lower lrvs of 0 1 at full scale than at bench scale the first obvious difference between full and bench scale operations other than the obvious scale of activities is that the o3 ct is unknown for full scale operations since the ozone residual is not a measurable parameter after the first ozonation barrier it is monitored after the second ozonation step since this is an important control parameter for pathogen inactivation for the bench scale results the o3 ct value was 0 063 mg min l therefore a combined knowledge of not just the o3 toc ratio but also the o3 ct value is indicated to be important to control coc removal furthermore when looking into the coc in each class half of the compounds in class 1 showed lrvs of 0 2 lower at full scale than at bench scale these are fast reacting chemicals with high reaction rate constants to o3 and their lrvs are closely related to the contact time the full scale plant operates in plug flow resulting in a distribution of contact times of a chemical to o3 this is clearly quite different to the complete mixing used in bench scale tests therefore some chemicals will pass through the contact tank in a period much shorter than the mean contact time in terms of coc in class 2 and 4 most are slightly recalcitrant to reaction with the oh radical which is less selective and occurs in the first 30 s wert et al 2009 it is interesting to note that the differences for removal of these coc were lower in absolute terms another potential difference between full and bench scale operations was the pre filtration of secondary effluent as a feed to the ozone barrier using glass microfiber filters for the bench scale tests the filtration aim was to weaken the effects of microorganism on chemical removal during refrigeration since it takes time to complete the series of bench scale tests it has been measured that a slight decrease 0 91 mg l in toc was observed for secondary effluent after filtration in the laboratory therefore a combination of plug flow versus well mixed and a higher toc non filtration of the secondary effluent in full scale operations could easily account for the observed differences meanwhile the operational temperatures at the time of sampling between full and bench scale had some differences as well as to sampling the water was collected in march autumn in the southern hemisphere for bench scale test and in august winter for full scale validation the difference in temperature was of order 5 c gardoni et al gardoni et al 2012 specified that in ozonation process temperature affects direct ozone reactions significantly more than oh radical reactions based on this we would expect to see a larger difference for class 1 molecule removals compared to class 2 and 4 between laboratory scale and full scale testing 3 2 3 removal validation using a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value fig 9 compares the removal performance of compounds under full scale operational conditions o3 toc ratio of 0 883 and unknown o3 ct value to bench scale results lower o3 toc ratio of 0 574 at various known o3 ct values for an o3 ct value of 0 079 at bench scale 60 compound removals were equal or lower than full scale for o3 ct values of 0 095 at bench scale 80 compounds showed higher lrvs than full scale for an o3 ct value of 0 409 at bench scale 93 compounds showed higher lrvs than full scale apart from the potential operational differences discussed above between bench and full scale to cause the resulting differences this result also suggests there is potential to obtain the same or better removal performance at a lower o3 toc ratio with a higher o3 ct value than just using a high o3 toc ratio given the high capital and operational cost of o3 generation a decrease of the o3 toc ratio but an increase in o3 ct values is indicated it is quite obviously difficult to increase the real contact time of all chemicals to o3 in a full scale system with plug flow operation the comparison of results from full scale and bench scale testing confirms a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value as a critical criterion to the removal of coc in a predictable manner excellent agreement between the bench and full scale results for uv254 and toc analysis has been demonstrated in fig s5 highlighting the potential for a range of real time surrogates to predict the removal efficiency of all detected compounds in class 1 2 and 4 to real plant scale operations and act as an additional integrity measure however in various systems there may be a certain amount of inherent variability in these relationship models but other literature indicated that the pilot and full scale validation efforts demonstrate that the models are robust gerrity et al 2012 conclusions a chemical credit framework to predict the coc removal from water in an ozone process has been established in this study this framework in the first instance combines both an o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value as operating monitoring parameters with the development of chemical classifications according to mechanisms of removal as defined through the susceptibility to ozone of specific chemical structures overall 1 in examining the o3 toc ratio or o3 ct value effects on coc removal the results show an obvious trend to coc classified by reaction rate constants to o3 and the oh radical coc with ko3 105 m 1 s 1 and k oh 109 m 1 s 1 showed an lrv of 1 for all o3 toc ratios 0 574 or o3 ct values 0 063 coc with ko3 10 m 1 s 1 but k oh 109 showed medium to poor removal even when the o3 toc ratio i e 3 177 or o3 ct value i e 0 839 was high 2 in considering the potential to use broad chemical structural classifications and performance criteria of o3 toc ratio and the o3 ct value the results indicate this to be viable whereby for coc with ko3 105 m 1 s 1 and k oh 109 m 1 s 1 an o3 toc ratio of 0 461 or a measurable o3 ct of 0 063 mg min l can achieve lrvs of 1 these are chemicals with aromatics structures for coc with low ko3 and high koh oh selective compounds only an o3 toc ratio or an o3 ct tool is not useful for an individual chemical a combined o3 toc ratio and o3 ct value inclusive of coc structural classification approach is indicated as necessary criteria 3 furthermore in view of the chemical credit framework measurement of uv254 and toc were tested as potential additional on line surrogates of ozone barrier integrity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
