25105,we developed a predictive model based on the mechanisms of photosynthesis and growth decline in c3 turfgrass which has applications for turfgrass management plans over a wide range of environments including shaded growth conditions such as turfed football stadiums the numerical formulas algorithms and parameters for defining photosynthesis and the growth decline in a turfgrass community are presented the parameters that were optimized to simulate photosynthesis and growth decline were included in the multilayer model for gas exchange and the vegetation growth decline model the model was validated using data collected on leaf biomass root biomass leaf area index cumulative mowing cumulative root growth and litter leaf and root over a 2 year period in a stadium in which japanese professional football league games are played we also developed an algorithm to simulate and map the growth conditions in two dimensions to fit the simulated and observed data better we varied the parameters by season and irradiance conditions the results showed that changes in leaf and root biomass over intervals that were less than annual affected gas exchange and the balance between respiration and assimilation rates and in turn caused changes in leaf and root biomass keywords photosynthesis respiration leaf biomass root biomass low irradiance football stadium 1 introduction turfgrass is often used in shaded areas of urban parks and stadiums insufficient light results in less than optimal conditions for turfgrass thereby reducing the lifespan of the pitch and possibly necessitating the use of expensive artificial lighting systems to supplement the natural light http www uefa org deterioration of soccer field turfgrass due to lack of light caused by shading has been observed since the 2002 soccer world cup was held in japan and south korea many new stadiums with roofs have been constructed in japan necessitating the development of new techniques to overcome the influence of roof shading c3 cool season turfgrass kentucky bluegrass poa pratensis l is used for such stadiums in warm climate regions because it is more tolerant to low irradiance than c4 turfgrass however the lower optimal growth temperature of c3 turfgrass results in slower growth during the summer in warm regions therefore developing an understanding of the gas exchange and growth decline properties of c3 turfgrass fields under various light conditions is necessary to plan the maintenance of c3 turfgrass fields in warm climates and to design stadiums in which this turfgrass can be grown and maintained at a high level of quality for sports activities growth assessment in turfgrass fields has been based on various measured factors including daily cumulative irradiance daily mean air and soil temperature and daily maximum and minimum air temperature beard 1973 and supplementary field experiments conducted to compensate for missing information e g jiang et al 2004 stanford et al 2005 su et al 2007 xu and huang 2000 however previous studies used field evidence derived in specific experimental settings field experiments can only provide a limited amount of information associated with specific field conditions in addition information on both gas exchange and growth decline of turfgrass under the multiple conditions with low irradiance and high temperature has been lacking prediction of turfgrass growth in roofed stadiums based solely on prior data is problematic a model assessing both gas exchange and growth decline is required using parameter sets based on detailed field observations of photosynthesis and growth decline of real turfgrass fields under various light and temperature conditions multilayer models of gas exchange have been developed for forest ecosystems e g leuning et al 1995 baldocchi and mayers 1998 lai et al 2000a b tanaka et al 2002 tanaka and hashimoto 2006 a combined gas exchange and growth decline model is also available watanabe et al 2004 in that model minosgi changes in biomass are assessed yearly and linked to gas exchange however in grassland ecosystems biomass may fluctuate over shorter intervals affecting gas exchange such changes may feed back to biomass parameters in this study we developed a model based on the mechanisms of turfgrass photosynthesis and growth decline kosugi et al 2010a b matsubara et al 2011 2012 that combines the multilayer model for co2 and h2o exchange in a grass community by tanaka et al 1998 tanaka et al 2002 takanashi 2005 and kosugi et al 2006 and the vegetation growth decline model by watanabe et al 2004 in our model meteorological conditions over a turfgrass community and the initial growth conditions were input into the model and net primary production npp in the form of photosynthate in the community was estimated the amount of npp allocated to leaves and roots was used to estimate leaf and root biomass the model parameters that were optimized to simulate photosynthesis and growth decline are included in the multilayer model for co2 and h2o exchange and the vegetation growth decline model we hypothesized that model parameters might acclimate low irradiance and seasonal fluctuations in temperature we also hypothesized that changes in leaf and root biomass over intervals less than annual would affect gas exchange and the balance between respiration and assimilation rates and in turn caused changes in leaf and root biomass we sought to obtain ecological insights into the modeling of not only c3 turfgrass fields but also grassland ecosystems in general 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the model was validated using field data obtained from turfgrass fields in a stadium and its surrounding area 34 39 n 134 10 e 20 m a s l in kobe hyogo prefecture japan the annual average temperature and precipitation during 2006 and 2007 were 17 2 c and 1201 mm respectively kobe is in a warm climate region in which c4 warm season turfgrass normally grows well test plots were established on a football field used by the japanese professional football league we established four plots with different light conditions including a nursery 600 m2 in an open unshaded area plot a another nursery 370 m2 covered by a pole frame plot b and pitches in a stadium 9279 m2 with a retractable roof that is typically open but surrounded by buildings that block the sun depending on the season and time of day plots c and d plot c was shaded both in the early morning and late afternoon plot d was shaded for the majority of each day except for a brief period in the afternoon compared to plot a the percentage of cumulative irradiance over 2 years january 2006 to december 2007 was 60 in plot b 48 in plot c and 20 in plot d kentucky bluegrass poa pratensis l which grows in open fields was installed in plot a and b in april 2004 in plot c in february 2005 and in plot d in february 2006 in a 1 1 blend of decomposed granite soil masa soil and sand the leaf and root biomass leaf area index lai amount of mowing and the amount of leaf and root litter were measured from january 2006 to december 2007 matsubara et al 2011 in february 2006 grass in plot d was replaced with new turf from an open field to examine the decline in biomass in the shade in these fields the grass canopy was homogeneous and completely closed adequate water and nutrients were supplied with nitrogen phosphorus potassium n p k ratios of 30 40 20 30 35 45 g m 2 during the growing season to prevent drought and nutrient stress the mowing height was approximately 30 mm table 1 2 2 measurements for validation data we used leaf and root biomasses the lai cumulative mowing data cumulative root growth and leaf and root litter weights to validate the data total vegetation including soil was sampled using a hexagonal instrument area 210 4 cm2 height 0 15 m n 1 in each plot every 2 weeks from january 2006 to december 2007 the dry weights of leaf biomass leaf necromass non assimilatory organ biomass roots and stems without chlorophyll and non assimilatory organ necromass were measured after washing soil away and separating tissues into their component parts mowed leaf biomass was sampled using a barrow type lawnmower area 2 9 m2 mowing height approx 30 mm n 1 in each plot twice monthly from january 2006 to december 2007 total leaf area measurements were made using an area analysis system li 3050c p li cor leaf mass per unit area lma was calculated using the above data table 2 2 3 model description 2 3 1 general description the model included both the multilayer model for co2 and h2o exchange in a grass community and the vegetation growth decline model of c3 turfgrass fields fig 1 meteorological elements including radiation air temperature humidity wind speed and precipitation over a turfgrass community and the initial growth conditions including root biomass and lai were input into the multilayer model for co2 and h2o exchange and profiles of meteorological elements leaf temperature soil temperature leaf photosynthesis and leaf root and decomposition respiration in the turfgrass community were estimated in 30 min intervals npp calculated using the multilayer model for co2 and h2o exchange was input into the vegetation growth decline model the vegetation growth decline model generated values for leaf and root biomass lai the amount of leaf and root litter and the amount of mowing each day thus growth and decline of turfgrass over the course of a year could be simulated and the seasonal fluctuations in many aspects of turfgrass growth including photosynthesis rate leaf and root biomass and lai under various environmental conditions could be analyzed 2 3 2 multilayer model for co2 and h2o exchange the multilayer model for co2 and h2o exchange contained sub models of six processes 1 reynolds stress sensible heat exchange and co2 and water vapor exchanges of leaves and the ground 2 stomatal conductance and photosynthesis of individual leaves and leaf root and decomposition respiration including growth respiration 3 structure and radiative transfer within the grass community 4 the energy balance of single leaves and the ground 5 rainfall interception and the leaf water budget and 6 soil respiration tanaka 2002 kosugi et al 2005 kosugi et al 2006 in the multilayer model the leaf temperature at each layer was estimated by solving the energy balance and the leaf vapor pressure at each layer was estimated by using leaf temperature assuming saturated conditions three features of this study differed from our previous work the co2 and h2o concentrations and air temperature were vertically uniform we did not use the second order closure model of atmospheric diffusion tanaka 2002 stomatal conductance was calculated using the jarvis not the ball model and leaf root and decomposition respirations were calculated separately using the original sub models rather than the soil respiration sub model 2 3 2 1 stomatal conductance and photosynthesis the model used for analysis was modified from that of farquhar et al 1980 which is a biochemical model of photosynthesis for c3

respiration rates of each layer estimated using sub model 2 of the multilayer model and the growth respiration rates of leaves r gf μmol m 2 s 1 root respiration rate was determined from the temperature dependency of root respiration rate using the arrhenius function and the growth respiration of the root the arrhenius function was also used to determine the temperature dependency of the decomposition respiration rate as follows 10 r r w r r r 25 exp 1 t ref t s δ h a r r r t ref r gr 11 r dec l f l r r dec 25 exp 1 t ref t s δ h a r dec r t ref where r r is the root respiration rate

meteorological data 2 3 3 vegetation growth decline model in the vegetation growth decline model the npp allocated to the leaves and roots as a result of gas exchange was estimated and the mowing rate and mortality rates of leaves and roots were also estimated followed by successive summing of leaf and root biomass lai and the weights of leaf and root litter leaf and root biomass data were used in the multilayer model to calculate co2 and h2o exchange to estimate the npp for the next day the growth respiration rates of leaves and roots were also considered 2 3 3 1 allocation of npp the npp kg c m 2 day 1 was estimated in 30 min intervals using the multilayer model and all of the values obtained over a 1 day period were integrated the npp was converted into biomass produced per day b kg m 2 day 1 using the ratio of biomass to carbon f c where 0 42 was used for f c the biomass allocated to leaves b f kg m 2 day 1 was determined using the ratio of the npp allocated to leaves when npp exceeded 0 and plants grew α f to the npp allocated when npp was less than 0 and plants declined α f the biomass allocated to roots b r kg m 2 day 1 was determined using 1 α f and 1 α f however all biomass is allocated to the root when the lai m2 m 2 exceeds the laimax and to the leaf when the lai falls below the laimin lai was calculated using the leaf biomass and the lma kg m 2 because the npp of c3 turfgrass is allocated mainly to the roots during winter α f distinguishes between seasons using a 4 day average of air temperature as a threshold the variable α f is also dependent upon light conditions 2 3 3 2 estimation of the mowing rate and the mortality rates of leaves and roots the mowing rate kg m 2 day 1 was calculated by dividing the amount of mowing per single operation by the mowing interval d mow day 1 when the lai exceeded the lower limit of the lai laiml m2 m 2 the amount of mowing per single operation was estimated by the mowing ratio r mow of the value in excess of laiml when the lai fell below the laiml the amount of mowing per single operation was estimated to be 0 the mortality rate of leaf biomass was calculated using the leaf biomass of the previous day and the leaf turnover ratio λ f which is the rate of leaf biomass death per day and is also the reciprocal number of the life duration of leaf biomass per day because λ f fluctuates between seasons λ f is distinguished between seasons using a 4 day average of air temperature as a threshold it is also influenced by damage to the turfgrass caused by use such as soccer matches similar to the mortality rate of leaf biomass the mortality rate of root biomass was calculated using the leaf biomass of the previous day and the root turnover ratio λ f λ f is distinguished between seasons and is influenced by turfgrass usage similar to λ f 2 3 3 3 leaf and root biomass lai and amounts of leaf and root litter the leaf growth rate kg m 2 day 1 was estimated by subtracting the mortality rate of leaf biomass and the mowing rate from the biomass allocated to leaves the root growth rate kg m 2 day 1 was estimated by subtracting the mortality rate of root biomass from the biomass allocated to roots during growth leaf biomass w f kg m 2 and root biomass w r kg m 2 were estimated using the leaf and root biomass values and the leaf and root growth rates of the previous day the result was used to calculate a multilayer model for co2 and h2o exchange in the turfgrass community for the subsequent day the lai was estimated using the lai of the previous day and the rate of lai increase calculated using the leaf growth rate and the lma the average seasonal fluctuation based on observation matsubara et al 2011 at each irradiance level was used to calculate the lma fig b1 leaf and root death rates kg m 2 day 1 were estimated using the negative value of the biomass allocated to leaves and roots during the decline and the mortality rate of leaf and root biomass leaf litter l f kg m 2 was estimated by subtracting leaf decomposition respiration from the amount of leaf litter of the previous day and adding the leaf death rate root litter l r kg m 2 was estimated using the amount of root litter of the previous day root decomposition respiration r decrr ratio and root death rate 2 4 parameterization 2 4 1 parameters used in the multilayer model for co2 and h2o exchange the parameters for the community structure and radiative transfer sub model were determined using observational data the turfgrass community was divided vertically into 12 equal layers and the top of the community was set at 0 03 m the distributions of leaf inclination angles were assumed to be normal with averages and standard deviations for layers 1 4 and 5 12 determined from data collected from 100 leaves in each plot the vertical profile of the lai lai structure was calculated from the weights of leaves sampled in three separate layers and the total lma the solar radiation transmissivity and reflectivity characteristics and the ppfd for leaves were calculated from a general value the solar radiation reflectivity characteristics and the ppfd for soil were calculated in a similar manner the bulk coefficient for sensible heat in the interception sub model was determined according to the sensible heat flux during the rainfall season takanashi et al 2003 we derived single leaf gas exchange parameters for the stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis sub model see 2 3 2 1 using temperature and light curves for leaves from plots a b c and d measured using the controlled chamber of a portable steady state photosynthesis measurement system in spring 2006 in addition we optimized parameters reflecting growth decline and acclimation and validated these by comparing observed and simulated diurnal changes in net assimilation rates matsubara et al 2011 2012 the parameters for root and decomposition respiration were based on observations at the study site we partitioned total ecosystem respiration into individual components kosugi et al 2010a and confirmed the differences in gross canopy photosynthesis and total ecosystem respiration under various light conditions kosugi et al 2010b see table 3 following matsubara et al 2012 we tested changes in v cmax25 over the seasons using air temperature and plots employing the relative irradiances of plots a d at air temperature over 23 c smaller v cmax25 was used for the lower irradiance plot to reflect summer decline under such conditions we used a larger 1 f fraction of light used photosynthetically at the chloroplast lamellae for the plot with lowest irradiance to reflect acclimation matsubara et al 2011 bold numbers in table 3 which also includes further details fig 1 2 4 2 parameters used in the vegetation growth decline model we optimized the vegetation growth decline model parameters in the simulation procedure so that the simulated seasonal fluctuation results for the leaf and root biomass lai amount of mowing and leaf and root litter fit the observed data for the four experimental plots the parameters used for c3 turfgrass in the vegetation growth decline model are presented in table 4 several parameters were classified by relative irradiance air temperature and field usage we tested seasonal changes in α f using air temperature and plots employing the relative irradiances of plots a d at air temperatures below 10 c α f was fixed at 0 to reflect the absence of leaf growth in winter at air temperatures over 10 c α f was set to 0 5 a smaller α f 0 45 was used for the plot of highest irradiance to reflect the larger allocation of npp to roots λ f and λ r were varied by season and the extent of field usage at air temperatures under 20 c λ f was set to infinity to reflect dormancy from fall to spring at air temperatures over 20 c λ f was set to 3 months but a lower value 1 5 months was used for the plot in which football matches were played to reflect damage caused by the games at air temperatures under 23 c λ r was set to infinite to reflect dormancy from fall to spring at air temperatures over 23 c λ r was set to 6 months but a lower value 3 months was used for the plot in which football matches were played to reflect damage caused by the games lma varied by season guided by fluctuations in the datasets fig b1 a lower laiml was assigned to the low irradiance plot to reflect the spindly leaf growth under such conditions bold numbers in table 4 which also contains additional details we calculated root mean square deviations rmsds to compare simulated and validation data on vegetation growth decline the rmsd is defined as follows 14 r m s d i n e i e i 2 n 2 5 algorithm for two dimensional simulation the multilayer model for co2 and h2o exchange in a turfgrass community and the vegetation growth decline model are one dimensional models used to estimate npp from photosynthesis and respiration and fluctuations in leaf and root biomass for each point in a plot therefore the pitch was divided into multiple grids and estimations were made for each point to simulate the two dimensional distribution of the results a detailed explanation of the algorithm is given in appendices a and b 3 results 3 1 overall performance of the model using various parameter sets estimates obtained using the multilayer model for gas exchange and the vegetation growth decline model in the 2 year period from 2006 to 2007 are shown in figs 2 5 and are classified into four levels of relative irradiance corresponding to plots a b c and d the estimated gross primary production gpp npp and the respiration rates of roots leaves and soil are presented individually estimates of the leaf and root biomass lai cumulative mowing cumulative root growth and leaf and root litter are shown and were validated by the observational data the parameters and fluctuations used in the models to simulate the actual growth decline of turfgrass are listed in tables 3 and 4 using parameter sets that varied by plot and season section 2 4 the overall fit between simulated and observed data was good the rmsds for leaf biomass root biomass the lai cumulative mowing cumulative root growth and leaf and root litter weights were 0 034 0 195 0 748 0 032 0 098 and 0 112 respectively if the parameter sets did not change by plot and season the results were poorer data not shown 3 2 gpp npp and respiration the simulated seasonal changes in gpp npp and respiration in plots a b c and d over the 2 year experimental period are shown in fig 2 bimodal seasonal changes in gpp and npp were detected with a large peak occurring between april and july and a smaller peak in the fall gpp and npp were higher in the plot with the highest irradiance the cumulative gpp and npp values in 2006 were 2488 and 705 g m 2 yr 1 plot a 2351 and 768 g m 2 yr 1 plot b 1915 and 786 g m 2 yr 1 plot c and 911 and 60 g m 2 yr 1 plot d respectively the cumulative npp in plot d the shadiest plot in 2006 was negative due to the low gpp under the shaded conditions and the high root respiration rate caused by the large root biomass planted in this plot in february 2006 leaf root and decomposition respiration rates peaked in spring early summer and summer respectively increased leaf respiration coincided with increased leaf biomass in contrast increased root and decomposition respiration was influenced by soil temperature all respiration values excluding decomposition respiration in plot d were higher in the plot with the highest irradiation which exhibited higher air and soil temperatures 3 3 leaf and root biomass the observed and simulated seasonal changes in leaf and root biomass in plots a b c and d over the 2 year experimental period are shown in fig 3 in plots a b and c both leaf and root biomass were low in the winter recovered from march to may peaked in may decreased during the summer and recovered slightly again in the fall in plot d a severe decline in root biomass was observed in 2006 which continued until the end of 2007 because new turf with high root biomass was planted in february 2006 leaf and root biomass values were highest in the plot with the highest irradiation the ratio of root to total biomass roots and leaves was also higher in the plot with the highest irradiation excluding plot d the simulated values for both leaf and root biomass reproduced seasonal trends in the observed values including bimodal seasonal changes in the plots with the highest irradiation a severe decline in root biomass in plot d and higher in the plot with the highest irradiation in plots b and c the simulated root biomass values slightly overestimated the observed values 3 4 lai and cumulative mowing the observed and simulated seasonal changes in lai and cumulative mowing in plots a b c and d over the 2 year experimental period are shown in fig 4 in the two plots with the highest irradiation plots a and b clear bimodal seasonal changes were detected in lai with a large peak between april and july and a smaller peak in the fall in the spring the increase in lai began in april coincident with the increase in leaf biomass the increase in lai was large compared to the increase in leaf biomass leaf area in plots a and b exhibited similar amplitudes and seasonal trends the lai was less for the two shadier plots than for plots a and b the simulated lai values were similar to the observed lai values which exhibited bimodal seasonal changes and lower values in plot d the amount of cumulative mowing in plots a b and c increased only slightly during the winter increased between spring and early summer was constant in the summer and increased again between fall and early winter in contrast the amount of cumulative mowing in the shadiest plot plot d remained constant during the summer the simulated annual cumulative values excluding plot d were similar to the observed values which were highest in plot b and lowest in plots a and c the simulated values also exhibited seasonal trends similar to those of the observed values 3 5 root growth and decline and amounts of leaf and root litter the observed and simulated yearly cumulative root growth and decline and amounts of leaf and root litter are illustrated in fig 5 for plots a b c and d over the 2 year experimental period in the two plots with the highest irradiation plots a and b growth was marked in march and declined in summer although the magnitude was dependent on the light conditions marked root growth was observed in the sunniest plot plot a during the warm winter of 2006 2007 in the second shadiest plot plot c the amplitude of growth and decline was small compared to the two sunnier plots in the shadiest plot plot d where new turf with a large root biomass was planted in february 2006 a severe decline in root biomass was observed in 2006 and it continued until the end of 2007 simulated cumulative root growth was similar to observations marked growth and decline in plots a and b smaller amplitudes in plot c and a severe decline resulting from the planting of new turf in plot d in february 2006 amounts of leaf and root litter were not significantly different between plots but were slightly higher in plots with the highest irradiation 3 6 mapping two dimensional distributions of monthly cumulative solar radiation mj m 2 on the soccer field are shown in fig 6 the northern direction is to the right side of the figure the goal and sidelines are represented by a white line and the numbers on the vertical and horizontal axes represent the distance m from the southeast corner plot c is located in the center of the soccer field and plot d is located in the center of the left sideline the area influenced by the shading from the roof is enlarged in the winter and diminished in the summer the two dimensional distributions of the leaf and root biomass per unit area were estimated using the multilayer model analysis for gas exchange and vegetation growth decline based on meteorological data for 2007 figs 7 and 8 the simulation was initiated from uniform growth conditions lai 2 5 m2 m 2 root biomass 0 5 kg m 2 on the pitch on january 1 conditions on day 15 of each month are shown leaf and root biomass exhibited the most significant increases in may decreased in june and declined significantly in the shady plot plot d differences between the sunny and shady plots became clear over time the values reflected the irradiance distribution compared to the two dimensional distribution of monthly cumulative solar radiation in january december 2007 shown in fig 6 the decrease in biomass observed in june did not recover in august this was due to increased respiration caused by the rise in air and soil temperatures fig 2e h biomass was generally maintained despite the significant decrease in the two dimensional distribution of irradiance after october this was due to decreased respiration resulting from the decreased air and soil temperatures 4 discussion seasonal trends in the observed leaf and root biomass values and higher values in sunnier plot were roughly reproduced by our model fig 3 the similarity of the simulated values for lai the amount of mowing except for plot d and amounts of leaf and root litter to the observed values during all periods also validated the description and parameterization of the model figs 4 and 5 the simulated lai values for plot d between summer 2006 and winter 2007 were lower than the observed values fig 4d the increased leaf area that resulted from over seeding may have affected the observed values the simulated values for mowing in plot d were also significantly lower than the observed values and were the lowest of all four plots fig 4h one possible explanation is that severe spindly growth may have occurred in shaded plots as noted by suzuki and kondo 2005 another possible explanation is that the increased leaf number caused by over seeding may have affected the observed values the magnitudes of the spring increases and summer declines in leaf biomass and root biomass depended on the light conditions fig 3 photosynthesis and plant respiration which together determine growth and decline were both higher in the sunnier sites than the shadier sites fig 2 these two factors depend on light and on leaf and soil temperature conditions because the sunnier sites had higher leaf and soil temperatures due to the higher levels of light the light conditions eventually governed the growth and decline of the turfgrass field matsubara et al 2011 thus the magnitudes of growth and decline were higher in the site with the highest irradiation both the observed matsubara et al 2011 and simulated results showed that light conditions are the critical factor determining root biomass how turfgrass with sufficient leaf and root biomass to be used for soccer fields can be maintained under low irradiance should be assessed based on analysis using a vegetation growth decline model both the observed and simulated values for cumulative root growth in plot d declined markedly as a result of the planting in february 2006 in plot d high root respiration rates were estimated in the summer of 2006 because of the large root biomass fig 2h despite the small gpp resulting from the shaded environment fig 2d we assumed that this unbalanced gpp and root respiration budget caused the severe decline in biomass in plot d these results strongly suggest that if new turfgrass with a large root biomass is planted in a roofed field severe decline triggered by low npp will occur as a result of high root respiration rates and low gpp 5 conclusions we developed a model using the multilayer model for gas exchange and the vegetation growth decline model of c3 turfgrass fields to reproduce the relationships between light conditions net photosynthesis and growth decline of grass in addition we mapped the growth conditions of turfgrass on a soccer field in two dimensions to fit the simulated and observed data better we varied the parameters by season and irradiance conditions the results showed that changes in leaf and root biomass over intervals that were less than annual affected gas exchange and the balance between respiration and assimilation rates and in turn caused changes in leaf and root biomass our model can be used to develop management plans for turfgrass in addition it is universally applicable to turfgrass fields in a variety of environments including shaded conditions thus it can be used to evaluate the growth and decline of turfgrass in various types of shaded stadiums and would facilitate the design of such stadiums for example the model could be used to determine in advance of stadium construction whether sufficient turfgrass leaf and root biomass can be maintained for use as soccer fields and avoid the risk of constructing a facility in which turfgrass is not able to grow also when turfgrass growth is poor in a completed facility we can identify the causes and apply the most economical and effective solution in addition optimal turfgrass management techniques can be selected based on this model without performing field tests which require large amounts of work time and expense e g use of a shading net and thermal cover and a period of rearing turfgrass for replacement the model can also be used to evaluate the influence of future climate change or interannual climate variability on the growth and decline of turfgrass fields this model has already been applied to improve turfgrass conditions in the stadium of the japanese professional football league j1 and in the design of a new soccer stadium we found that modeling of c3turfgrass fields grown under low irradiance at warm temperatures required the use of unique gas exchange and growth decline models for grasslands which differ from those that are appropriate for forests to obtain parameter sets that varied by season and irradiance conditions we gathered data on leaf and community scale photosynthesis and respiration leaf and root biomass lai cumulative mowing and leaf and root litter weights over a 2 year period such field observations require the controlled chamber of a portable steady state photosynthesis measurement system and the closed dynamic chamber system to assess leaf and community scale gas exchange as well as micro meteorological observations however when an appropriate model is available it is possible to predict vegetation growth decline under various conditions without the need for laborious growth tests a limitation of our study is that different grasslands may exhibit different parameters with different fluctuations thus further ecological studies on gas exchange and growth decline parameters are required when such information is available our model will aid the assessment and management of a wider range of agricultural fields

co ltd for collecting field data appendix a time series of solar radiation of each grid the solar radiation incident on turfgrass is basic input data along with air temperature relative humidity wind speed and precipitation during mapping the values of direct solar radiation s b diffuse solar radiation s d direct ppfd s ppfdb diffuse ppfd s ppfdd and downward long wave radiation l for each grid were collected at 30 min intervals the procedure used to calculate time series data of incident solar radiation w m 2 at each grid is shown below it is noted that the incident solar radiation to the surface of turfgrass is treated as the horizontal solar radiation flux density here the two dimensional distribution of solar radiation reaching a pitch is determined by the sun s elevation weather and whether the retractable roof is open or closed fig a1 the sun s elevation is calculated from the astronomical date and time before reaching the ground solar radiation is attenuated in the atmosphere through absorption and scattering by atmospheric molecules aerosols water vapor carbon dioxide cloud particles and so on solar radiation that reaches the ground is composed of the direct neither absorbed nor scattered and the diffusive scattered components here separation of solar radiation into direct and diffusive components was performed by reference to weather the extent of cloud cover turfgrass is illuminated by direct and diffuse radiation from the sun and the sky and diffuse radiation reflected by the stands and roof some fractions of the incident radiation on turfgrass and the stands are reflected by them which are then reflected once again by the roofs and the stands thus re illuminating the turfgrass only the component of radiation consisting of diffusive radiation from the sky and reflected radiation from the roof and stands reaches sections where direct radiation is obstructed by the roof considering these processes the solar radiation to reach turfgrass at arbitrary points on the pitch is estimated by summing the incoming direct and multiply scattered radiations with consideration of sun and shade distributions caused by the roof which can be open or closed the specific calculations were performed as follows by assuming that the hourly horizontal global solar radiation data of the osaka meteorological office were temporally uniform over the period between consecutive hourly observations the observed horizontal global solar radiation flux was separated into direct and diffuse components the diffuse component was assumed to be uniform with respect to the zenith and azimuth angles the direct component was empirically parameterized using direct solar radiation data obtained from the japan meteorological agency as functions of atmospheric path length and cloud amount the diffuse radiation was derived by subtracting the direct solar radiation from the global solar radiation the turfgrass surface and the stadium envelope were divided into a number of triangular surface elements triangular polygon for each polygon the radiation fluxes reaching that polygon from the sun sky and surface elements that can be seen from the polygon of interest were summed the mutual solid angles between pairs of surface elements of interest and the inclination of the incident beam with respect to the normal of the surface element were considered in this calculation isotropy was assumed for the reflection from turfgrass and building materials multiple reflections of radiation up to the second order were taken into account because the surface albedos of turfgrass and building materials which ranged from 0 15 the concrete stands and roof to 0 25 turfgrass pielke 1984 allowed us to neglect contributions from higher order reflections the weather classification and the open closed state of the retractable roof were also considered as follows a time series data of solar radiation reaching each grid on the pitch were calculated in 30 min intervals over 1 day for the 12 combinations of three roof states open closed and half closed and four weather classifications every 10 days between january 5 and december 25 b since the time series data of solar radiation derived in step a were calculated every 10 days the data for days in the interval 1 10 were complemented by the 10 day data using linear interpolation with respect to time using steps a and b time series data for solar radiation of each grid in the pitch in 30 min intervals over 365 days were obtained for all combinations of the four weather classes and three states of the retractable roof the solar radiation fluxes s w m 2 were written to files with the month mm day dd time in 30 min intervals time roof state roof weather classification weather and the position of the grid on the pitch i j as follows a1 s s m m d d t i m e r o o f w e a t h e r i j using the above procedures basic solar radiation datasets were prepared before calculating the multilayer model for gas exchange and vegetation growth decline c the time series data of solar radiation corresponding to changes in the weather and roof states were used for input data to the multilayer model for gas exchange and also the vegetation growth decline model weather data were obtained from an adjacent meteorological observatory and the roof states were obtained from the annual record the retracting roof in detail weather classifications on a specific day and at a specific time were determined based on the cloud amount at the meteorological observatory the solar radiation data at a certain time was chosen from the data set described above corresponding to the weather classification and roof states when these operations were performed in 30 min intervals for 1 year the annual solar radiation data at all grid points i j on the pitch were obtained corresponding to the actual changes in the weather and roof states the procedure for partitioning the solar radiation into direct and diffuse components is applicable to other stadiums if data at a meteorological observatory near the stadium are used appendix b distribution of model parameters by the relative irradiance of each grid parameters dependent on relative irradiance are shown in tables 3 and 4 and fig b1 the relative irradiance is the annual average of solar radiation at a certain within stadium position divided by that of solar radiation outside the stadium each parameter was classified into four grades relative irradiances 0 0 39 0 4 0 59 0 6 0 79 and 0 8 1 0 the parameters for each plot tables 3 and 4 were assigned to the four grades each parameter in tables 3 and 4 and fig b1 corresponds to a median relative irradiance between the upper and lower limit of each grade the parameter values at points that differed from this median value were complemented by values corresponding to the upper and lower grades thus the complement equation characterizes the relative irradiance r and the parameter f as

25105,we developed a predictive model based on the mechanisms of photosynthesis and growth decline in c3 turfgrass which has applications for turfgrass management plans over a wide range of environments including shaded growth conditions such as turfed football stadiums the numerical formulas algorithms and parameters for defining photosynthesis and the growth decline in a turfgrass community are presented the parameters that were optimized to simulate photosynthesis and growth decline were included in the multilayer model for gas exchange and the vegetation growth decline model the model was validated using data collected on leaf biomass root biomass leaf area index cumulative mowing cumulative root growth and litter leaf and root over a 2 year period in a stadium in which japanese professional football league games are played we also developed an algorithm to simulate and map the growth conditions in two dimensions to fit the simulated and observed data better we varied the parameters by season and irradiance conditions the results showed that changes in leaf and root biomass over intervals that were less than annual affected gas exchange and the balance between respiration and assimilation rates and in turn caused changes in leaf and root biomass keywords photosynthesis respiration leaf biomass root biomass low irradiance football stadium 1 introduction turfgrass is often used in shaded areas of urban parks and stadiums insufficient light results in less than optimal conditions for turfgrass thereby reducing the lifespan of the pitch and possibly necessitating the use of expensive artificial lighting systems to supplement the natural light http www uefa org deterioration of soccer field turfgrass due to lack of light caused by shading has been observed since the 2002 soccer world cup was held in japan and south korea many new stadiums with roofs have been constructed in japan necessitating the development of new techniques to overcome the influence of roof shading c3 cool season turfgrass kentucky bluegrass poa pratensis l is used for such stadiums in warm climate regions because it is more tolerant to low irradiance than c4 turfgrass however the lower optimal growth temperature of c3 turfgrass results in slower growth during the summer in warm regions therefore developing an understanding of the gas exchange and growth decline properties of c3 turfgrass fields under various light conditions is necessary to plan the maintenance of c3 turfgrass fields in warm climates and to design stadiums in which this turfgrass can be grown and maintained at a high level of quality for sports activities growth assessment in turfgrass fields has been based on various measured factors including daily cumulative irradiance daily mean air and soil temperature and daily maximum and minimum air temperature beard 1973 and supplementary field experiments conducted to compensate for missing information e g jiang et al 2004 stanford et al 2005 su et al 2007 xu and huang 2000 however previous studies used field evidence derived in specific experimental settings field experiments can only provide a limited amount of information associated with specific field conditions in addition information on both gas exchange and growth decline of turfgrass under the multiple conditions with low irradiance and high temperature has been lacking prediction of turfgrass growth in roofed stadiums based solely on prior data is problematic a model assessing both gas exchange and growth decline is required using parameter sets based on detailed field observations of photosynthesis and growth decline of real turfgrass fields under various light and temperature conditions multilayer models of gas exchange have been developed for forest ecosystems e g leuning et al 1995 baldocchi and mayers 1998 lai et al 2000a b tanaka et al 2002 tanaka and hashimoto 2006 a combined gas exchange and growth decline model is also available watanabe et al 2004 in that model minosgi changes in biomass are assessed yearly and linked to gas exchange however in grassland ecosystems biomass may fluctuate over shorter intervals affecting gas exchange such changes may feed back to biomass parameters in this study we developed a model based on the mechanisms of turfgrass photosynthesis and growth decline kosugi et al 2010a b matsubara et al 2011 2012 that combines the multilayer model for co2 and h2o exchange in a grass community by tanaka et al 1998 tanaka et al 2002 takanashi 2005 and kosugi et al 2006 and the vegetation growth decline model by watanabe et al 2004 in our model meteorological conditions over a turfgrass community and the initial growth conditions were input into the model and net primary production npp in the form of photosynthate in the community was estimated the amount of npp allocated to leaves and roots was used to estimate leaf and root biomass the model parameters that were optimized to simulate photosynthesis and growth decline are included in the multilayer model for co2 and h2o exchange and the vegetation growth decline model we hypothesized that model parameters might acclimate low irradiance and seasonal fluctuations in temperature we also hypothesized that changes in leaf and root biomass over intervals less than annual would affect gas exchange and the balance between respiration and assimilation rates and in turn caused changes in leaf and root biomass we sought to obtain ecological insights into the modeling of not only c3 turfgrass fields but also grassland ecosystems in general 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the model was validated using field data obtained from turfgrass fields in a stadium and its surrounding area 34 39 n 134 10 e 20 m a s l in kobe hyogo prefecture japan the annual average temperature and precipitation during 2006 and 2007 were 17 2 c and 1201 mm respectively kobe is in a warm climate region in which c4 warm season turfgrass normally grows well test plots were established on a football field used by the japanese professional football league we established four plots with different light conditions including a nursery 600 m2 in an open unshaded area plot a another nursery 370 m2 covered by a pole frame plot b and pitches in a stadium 9279 m2 with a retractable roof that is typically open but surrounded by buildings that block the sun depending on the season and time of day plots c and d plot c was shaded both in the early morning and late afternoon plot d was shaded for the majority of each day except for a brief period in the afternoon compared to plot a the percentage of cumulative irradiance over 2 years january 2006 to december 2007 was 60 in plot b 48 in plot c and 20 in plot d kentucky bluegrass poa pratensis l which grows in open fields was installed in plot a and b in april 2004 in plot c in february 2005 and in plot d in february 2006 in a 1 1 blend of decomposed granite soil masa soil and sand the leaf and root biomass leaf area index lai amount of mowing and the amount of leaf and root litter were measured from january 2006 to december 2007 matsubara et al 2011 in february 2006 grass in plot d was replaced with new turf from an open field to examine the decline in biomass in the shade in these fields the grass canopy was homogeneous and completely closed adequate water and nutrients were supplied with nitrogen phosphorus potassium n p k ratios of 30 40 20 30 35 45 g m 2 during the growing season to prevent drought and nutrient stress the mowing height was approximately 30 mm table 1 2 2 measurements for validation data we used leaf and root biomasses the lai cumulative mowing data cumulative root growth and leaf and root litter weights to validate the data total vegetation including soil was sampled using a hexagonal instrument area 210 4 cm2 height 0 15 m n 1 in each plot every 2 weeks from january 2006 to december 2007 the dry weights of leaf biomass leaf necromass non assimilatory organ biomass roots and stems without chlorophyll and non assimilatory organ necromass were measured after washing soil away and separating tissues into their component parts mowed leaf biomass was sampled using a barrow type lawnmower area 2 9 m2 mowing height approx 30 mm n 1 in each plot twice monthly from january 2006 to december 2007 total leaf area measurements were made using an area analysis system li 3050c p li cor leaf mass per unit area lma was calculated using the above data table 2 2 3 model description 2 3 1 general description the model included both the multilayer model for co2 and h2o exchange in a grass community and the vegetation growth decline model of c3 turfgrass fields fig 1 meteorological elements including radiation air temperature humidity wind speed and precipitation over a turfgrass community and the initial growth conditions including root biomass and lai were input into the multilayer model for co2 and h2o exchange and profiles of meteorological elements leaf temperature soil temperature leaf photosynthesis and leaf root and decomposition respiration in the turfgrass community were estimated in 30 min intervals npp calculated using the multilayer model for co2 and h2o exchange was input into the vegetation growth decline model the vegetation growth decline model generated values for leaf and root biomass lai the amount of leaf and root litter and the amount of mowing each day thus growth and decline of turfgrass over the course of a year could be simulated and the seasonal fluctuations in many aspects of turfgrass growth including photosynthesis rate leaf and root biomass and lai under various environmental conditions could be analyzed 2 3 2 multilayer model for co2 and h2o exchange the multilayer model for co2 and h2o exchange contained sub models of six processes 1 reynolds stress sensible heat exchange and co2 and water vapor exchanges of leaves and the ground 2 stomatal conductance and photosynthesis of individual leaves and leaf root and decomposition respiration including growth respiration 3 structure and radiative transfer within the grass community 4 the energy balance of single leaves and the ground 5 rainfall interception and the leaf water budget and 6 soil respiration tanaka 2002 kosugi et al 2005 kosugi et al 2006 in the multilayer model the leaf temperature at each layer was estimated by solving the energy balance and the leaf vapor pressure at each layer was estimated by using leaf temperature assuming saturated conditions three features of this study differed from our previous work the co2 and h2o concentrations and air temperature were vertically uniform we did not use the second order closure model of atmospheric diffusion tanaka 2002 stomatal conductance was calculated using the jarvis not the ball model and leaf root and decomposition respirations were calculated separately using the original sub models rather than the soil respiration sub model 2 3 2 1 stomatal conductance and photosynthesis the model used for analysis was modified from that of farquhar et al 1980 which is a biochemical model of photosynthesis for c3

and mortality rates of leaves and roots were also estimated followed by successive summing of leaf and root biomass lai and the weights of leaf and root litter leaf and root biomass data were used in the multilayer model to calculate co2 and h2o exchange to estimate the npp for the next day the growth respiration rates of leaves and roots were also considered 2 3 3 1 allocation of npp the npp kg c m 2 day 1 was estimated in 30 min intervals using the multilayer model and all of the values obtained over a 1 day period were integrated the npp was converted into biomass produced per day b kg m 2 day 1 using the ratio of biomass to carbon f c where 0 42 was used for f c the biomass allocated to leaves b f kg m 2 day 1 was determined using the ratio of the npp allocated to leaves when npp exceeded 0 and plants grew α f to the npp allocated when npp was less than 0 and plants declined α f the biomass allocated to roots b r kg m 2 day 1 was determined using 1 α f and 1 α f however all biomass is allocated to the root when the lai m2 m 2 exceeds the laimax and to the leaf when the lai falls below the laimin lai was calculated using the leaf biomass and the lma kg m 2 because the npp of c3 turfgrass is allocated mainly to the roots during winter α f distinguishes between seasons using a 4 day average of air temperature as a threshold the variable α f is also dependent upon light conditions 2 3 3 2 estimation of the mowing rate and the mortality rates of leaves and roots the mowing rate kg m 2 day 1 was calculated by dividing the amount of mowing per single operation by the

laiml when the lai fell below the laiml the amount of mowing per single operation was estimated to be 0 the mortality rate of leaf biomass was calculated using the leaf biomass of the previous day and the leaf turnover ratio λ f which is the rate of leaf biomass death per day and is also the reciprocal number of the life duration of leaf biomass per day because λ f fluctuates between seasons λ f is distinguished between seasons using a 4 day average of air temperature as a threshold it is also influenced by damage to the turfgrass caused by use such as soccer matches similar to the mortality rate of leaf biomass the mortality rate of root biomass was calculated using the leaf biomass of the previous day and the root turnover ratio λ f λ f is distinguished between seasons and is influenced by turfgrass usage similar to λ f 2 3 3 3 leaf and root biomass lai and amounts of leaf and root litter the leaf growth rate kg m 2 day 1 was estimated by subtracting the mortality rate of leaf biomass and the mowing rate from the biomass allocated to leaves the root growth rate kg m 2 day 1 was estimated by subtracting the mortality rate of root biomass from the biomass allocated to roots during growth leaf biomass w f kg m 2 and root biomass w r kg m 2 were estimated using the leaf and root biomass values and the leaf and root growth rates of the previous day the result was used to

for the community structure and radiative transfer sub model were determined using observational data the turfgrass community was divided vertically into 12 equal layers and the top of the community was set at 0 03 m the distributions of leaf inclination angles were assumed to be normal with averages and standard deviations for layers 1 4 and 5 12 determined from data collected from 100 leaves in each plot the vertical profile of the lai lai structure was calculated from the weights of leaves sampled in three separate layers and the total lma the solar radiation transmissivity and reflectivity characteristics and the ppfd for leaves were calculated from a general value the solar radiation reflectivity characteristics and the ppfd for soil were calculated in a similar manner the bulk coefficient for sensible heat in the interception sub model was determined according to the sensible heat flux during the rainfall season takanashi et al 2003 we derived single leaf gas exchange parameters for the stomatal conductance and net photosynthesis sub model see 2 3 2 1 using temperature and light curves for leaves from plots a b c and d measured using the controlled chamber of a portable steady state photosynthesis measurement system in spring 2006 in addition we optimized parameters reflecting growth decline and acclimation and validated these by comparing observed and simulated diurnal changes in net assimilation rates matsubara et al 2011 2012 the parameters for root and decomposition respiration were based on observations at the study site we partitioned total ecosystem respiration into individual components kosugi et al 2010a and confirmed the differences in gross canopy photosynthesis and total ecosystem respiration under various light conditions kosugi et al 2010b see table 3 following matsubara et al 2012 we tested changes in v cmax25 over the seasons using air temperature and plots employing the relative irradiances of plots a d at air temperature over 23 c smaller v cmax25 was used for the lower irradiance plot to reflect summer decline under such conditions we used a larger 1 f fraction of light used photosynthetically at the chloroplast lamellae for the plot with lowest irradiance to reflect acclimation matsubara et al 2011 bold numbers in table 3 which also includes further details fig 1 2 4 2 parameters used in the vegetation growth decline model we optimized the vegetation growth decline model parameters in the simulation procedure so that the simulated seasonal fluctuation results for the leaf and root biomass lai amount of mowing and leaf and root litter fit the observed data for the four experimental plots the parameters used for c3 turfgrass in the vegetation growth decline model are presented in table 4 several parameters were classified by relative irradiance air temperature and field usage we tested seasonal changes in α f using air temperature and plots employing the relative irradiances of plots a d at air temperatures below 10 c α f was fixed at 0 to reflect the absence of leaf growth in winter at air temperatures over 10 c α f was set to 0 5 a smaller α f 0 45 was used for the plot of highest irradiance to reflect the larger allocation of npp to roots λ f and λ r were varied by season and the extent of field usage at air temperatures under 20 c λ f was set to infinity to reflect dormancy from fall to spring at air temperatures over 20 c λ f was set to 3 months but a lower value 1 5 months was used for the plot in which football matches were played to reflect damage caused by the games at air temperatures under 23 c λ r was set to infinite to reflect dormancy from fall to spring at air temperatures over 23 c λ r was set to 6 months but a lower value 3 months was used for the plot in which football matches were played to reflect damage caused by the games lma varied by season guided by fluctuations in the datasets fig b1 a lower laiml was assigned to the low irradiance plot to reflect the spindly leaf growth under such conditions bold numbers in table 4 which also contains additional details we calculated root mean square deviations rmsds to compare simulated and validation data on vegetation growth decline the rmsd is defined as follows 14 r m s d i n e i e i 2 n 2 5 algorithm for two dimensional simulation the multilayer model for co2 and h2o exchange in a turfgrass community and the vegetation growth decline model are one dimensional models used to estimate npp from photosynthesis and respiration and fluctuations in leaf and root biomass for each point in a plot

shown and were validated by the observational data the parameters and fluctuations used in the models to simulate the actual growth decline of turfgrass are listed in tables 3 and 4 using parameter sets that varied by plot and season section 2 4 the overall fit between simulated and observed data was good the rmsds for leaf biomass root biomass the lai cumulative mowing cumulative root growth and leaf and root litter weights were 0 034 0 195 0 748 0 032 0 098 and 0 112 respectively if the parameter sets did not change by plot and season the results were poorer data not shown 3 2 gpp npp and respiration the simulated seasonal changes in gpp npp and respiration in plots a b c and d over the 2 year experimental period are shown in fig 2 bimodal seasonal changes in gpp and npp were detected with a large peak occurring between april and july and a smaller peak in the fall gpp and npp were higher in the plot with the highest irradiance the cumulative gpp and npp values in 2006 were 2488 and 705 g m 2 yr 1 plot a 2351 and 768 g m 2 yr 1 plot b 1915 and 786 g m 2 yr 1 plot c and 911 and 60 g m 2 yr 1 plot d respectively the cumulative npp in plot d the shadiest plot in 2006 was negative due to the low gpp under the shaded conditions and the high root respiration rate caused by the large root biomass planted in this plot in february 2006 leaf root and decomposition respiration rates peaked in spring early summer and summer respectively increased leaf respiration coincided with increased leaf biomass in contrast increased root and decomposition respiration was influenced by soil temperature all respiration values excluding decomposition respiration in plot d were higher in the plot with the highest irradiation which exhibited higher air and soil temperatures 3 3 leaf and root biomass the observed and simulated seasonal changes in leaf and root biomass in plots a b c and d over the 2 year experimental period are shown in fig 3 in plots a b and c both leaf and root biomass were low in the winter recovered from march to may peaked in may decreased during the summer and recovered slightly again in the fall in plot d a severe decline in root biomass was observed in 2006 which continued until the end of 2007 because new turf with high root biomass was planted in february 2006 leaf and root biomass values were highest in the plot with the highest irradiation the ratio of root to total biomass roots and leaves was also higher in the plot with the highest irradiation excluding plot d the simulated values for both leaf and root biomass reproduced seasonal trends in the observed values including bimodal seasonal changes in the plots with the highest irradiation a severe decline in root biomass in plot d and higher in the plot with the highest irradiation in plots b and c the simulated root biomass values slightly overestimated the observed values 3 4 lai and cumulative mowing the observed and simulated seasonal changes in lai and cumulative mowing in plots a b c and d over the 2 year experimental period are shown in fig 4 in the two plots with the highest irradiation plots a and b clear bimodal seasonal changes were detected in lai with a large peak between april and july and a smaller peak in the fall in the spring the increase in lai began in april coincident with the increase in leaf biomass the increase in lai was large compared to the increase in leaf biomass leaf area in plots a and b exhibited similar amplitudes and seasonal trends the lai was less for the two shadier plots than for plots a and b the simulated lai values were similar to the observed lai values which exhibited bimodal seasonal changes and lower values in plot d the amount of cumulative mowing in plots a b and c increased only slightly during the winter increased between spring and early summer was constant in the summer and increased again between fall and early winter in contrast the amount of cumulative mowing in the shadiest plot plot d remained constant during the summer the simulated annual cumulative values excluding plot d were similar to the observed values which were highest in plot b and lowest in plots a and c the simulated values also exhibited seasonal trends similar to those of the observed values 3 5 root growth and decline and amounts of leaf and root litter the observed and simulated yearly cumulative root growth and decline and amounts of leaf and root litter are illustrated in fig 5 for plots a b c and d over the 2 year experimental period in the two plots with the highest irradiation plots a and b growth was marked in march and declined in summer although the magnitude was dependent on the light conditions marked root growth was observed in the sunniest plot plot a during the warm winter of 2006 2007 in the second shadiest plot plot c the amplitude of growth and decline was small compared to the two sunnier plots in the shadiest plot plot d where new turf with a large root biomass was planted in february 2006 a severe decline in root biomass was observed in 2006 and it continued until the end of 2007 simulated cumulative root growth was similar to observations marked growth and decline in plots a and b smaller amplitudes in plot c and a severe decline resulting from the planting of new turf in plot d in february 2006 amounts of leaf and root litter were not significantly different between plots but were slightly higher in plots with the highest irradiation 3 6 mapping two dimensional distributions of monthly cumulative solar radiation mj m 2 on the soccer field are shown in fig 6 the northern direction is to the right side of the figure the goal and sidelines are represented by a white line and the numbers on the vertical and horizontal axes represent the distance m from the southeast corner plot c is located in the center of the soccer field and plot d is located in the center of the left sideline the area influenced by the shading from the roof is enlarged in the winter and diminished in the summer the two dimensional distributions of the leaf and root biomass per unit area were estimated using the multilayer model analysis for gas exchange and vegetation growth decline based on meteorological data for 2007 figs 7 and 8 the simulation was initiated from uniform growth conditions lai 2 5 m2 m 2 root biomass 0 5 kg m 2 on the pitch on january 1 conditions on day 15 of each month are shown leaf and root biomass exhibited the most significant increases in may decreased in june and declined significantly in the shady plot plot d differences between the sunny and shady plots became clear over time the values reflected the irradiance distribution compared to the two dimensional distribution of monthly cumulative solar radiation in january december 2007 shown in fig 6 the decrease in biomass observed in june did not recover in august this was due to increased respiration caused by the rise in air and soil temperatures fig 2e h biomass was generally maintained despite the significant decrease in the two dimensional distribution of irradiance after october this was due to decreased respiration resulting from the decreased air and soil temperatures 4 discussion seasonal trends in the observed leaf and root biomass values and higher values in sunnier plot were roughly reproduced by our model fig 3 the similarity of the simulated values for lai the amount of mowing except for plot d and amounts of leaf and root litter to the observed values during all periods also validated the description and parameterization of the model figs 4 and 5 the simulated lai values for plot d between summer 2006 and winter 2007 were lower than the observed values fig 4d the increased leaf area that resulted from over seeding may have affected the observed values the simulated values for mowing in plot d were also significantly lower than the observed values and were the lowest of all four plots fig 4h one possible explanation is that severe spindly growth may have occurred in shaded plots as noted by suzuki and kondo 2005 another possible explanation is that the increased leaf number caused by over seeding may have affected the observed values the magnitudes of the spring increases and summer declines in leaf biomass and root biomass depended on the light conditions fig 3 photosynthesis and plant respiration which together determine growth and decline were both higher in the sunnier sites than the shadier sites fig 2 these two factors depend on light and on leaf and soil temperature conditions because the sunnier sites had higher leaf and soil temperatures due to the higher levels of light the light conditions eventually governed the growth and decline of the turfgrass field matsubara et al 2011 thus the magnitudes of growth and decline were higher in the site with the highest irradiation both the observed matsubara et al 2011 and simulated results showed that light conditions are the critical factor determining root biomass how turfgrass with sufficient leaf and root biomass to be used for soccer fields can be maintained under low irradiance should be assessed based on analysis using a vegetation growth decline model both the observed and simulated values for cumulative root growth in plot d declined markedly as a result of the planting in february 2006 in plot d high root respiration rates were estimated in the summer of 2006 because of the large root biomass fig 2h despite the small gpp resulting from the shaded environment fig 2d we assumed that this unbalanced gpp and root respiration budget caused the severe decline in biomass in plot d these results strongly suggest that if new turfgrass with a large root biomass is planted in a roofed field severe decline triggered by low npp will occur as a result of high root respiration rates and low gpp 5 conclusions we developed a model using the multilayer model for gas exchange and the vegetation growth decline model of c3 turfgrass fields to reproduce the relationships between light conditions net photosynthesis and growth decline of grass in addition we mapped the growth conditions of turfgrass on a soccer field in two dimensions to fit the simulated and observed data better we varied the parameters by season and irradiance conditions the results showed that changes in leaf and root biomass over intervals that were less than annual affected gas exchange and the balance between respiration and assimilation rates and in turn caused changes in leaf and root biomass our model can be used to develop management plans for turfgrass in addition it is universally applicable to turfgrass fields in a variety of environments including shaded conditions thus it can be used to evaluate the growth and decline of turfgrass in various types of shaded stadiums and would facilitate the design of such stadiums for example the model could be used to determine in advance of stadium construction whether sufficient turfgrass leaf and root biomass can be maintained for use as soccer fields and avoid the risk of constructing a facility in which turfgrass is not able to grow also when turfgrass growth is poor in a completed facility we can identify the causes and apply the most economical and effective solution in addition optimal turfgrass management techniques can be selected based on this model without performing field tests which require large amounts of work time and expense e g use of a shading net and thermal cover and a period of rearing turfgrass for replacement the model can also be used to evaluate the influence of future climate change or interannual climate variability on the growth and decline of turfgrass fields this model has already been applied to improve turfgrass conditions in the stadium of the japanese professional football league j1 and in the design of a new soccer stadium we found that modeling of c3turfgrass fields grown under low irradiance at warm temperatures required the use of unique gas exchange and growth decline models for grasslands which differ from those that are appropriate for forests to obtain parameter sets that varied by season and irradiance conditions we gathered data on leaf and community scale photosynthesis and respiration leaf and root biomass lai cumulative mowing and leaf and root litter weights over a 2 year period such field observations require the controlled chamber of a portable steady state photosynthesis measurement system and the closed dynamic chamber system to assess leaf and community scale gas exchange as well as micro meteorological observations however when an appropriate model is available it is possible to predict vegetation growth decline under various conditions without the need for laborious growth tests a limitation of our study is that different grasslands may exhibit different parameters with different fluctuations thus further ecological studies on gas exchange and growth decline parameters are required when such information is available our model will aid the assessment and management of a wider range of agricultural fields

co ltd for collecting field data appendix a time series of solar radiation of each grid the solar radiation incident on turfgrass is basic input data along with air temperature relative humidity wind speed and precipitation during mapping the values of direct solar radiation s b diffuse solar radiation s d direct ppfd s ppfdb diffuse ppfd s ppfdd and downward long wave radiation l for each grid were collected at 30 min intervals the procedure used to calculate time series data of incident solar radiation w m 2 at each grid is shown below it is noted that the incident solar radiation to the surface of turfgrass is treated as the horizontal solar radiation flux density here the two dimensional distribution of solar radiation reaching a pitch is determined by the sun s elevation weather and whether the retractable roof is open or closed fig a1 the sun s elevation is calculated from the astronomical date and time before reaching the ground solar radiation is attenuated in the atmosphere through absorption and scattering by atmospheric molecules aerosols water vapor carbon dioxide cloud particles and so on solar radiation that reaches the ground is composed of the direct neither absorbed nor scattered and the diffusive scattered components here separation of solar radiation into direct and diffusive components was performed by reference to weather the extent of cloud cover turfgrass is illuminated by direct and diffuse radiation from the sun and the sky and diffuse radiation reflected by the stands and roof some fractions of the incident radiation on turfgrass and the stands are reflected by them which are then reflected once again by the roofs and the stands thus re illuminating the turfgrass only the component of radiation consisting of diffusive radiation from the sky and reflected radiation from the roof and stands reaches sections where direct radiation is obstructed by the roof considering these processes the solar radiation to reach turfgrass at arbitrary points on the pitch is estimated by summing the incoming direct and multiply scattered radiations with consideration of sun and shade distributions caused by the roof which can be open or closed the specific calculations were performed as follows by assuming that the hourly horizontal global solar radiation data of the osaka meteorological office were temporally uniform over the period between consecutive hourly observations the observed horizontal global solar radiation flux was separated into direct and diffuse components the diffuse component was assumed to be uniform with respect to the zenith and azimuth angles the direct component was empirically parameterized using direct solar radiation data obtained from the japan meteorological agency as functions of atmospheric path length and cloud amount the diffuse radiation was derived by subtracting the direct solar radiation from the global solar radiation the turfgrass surface and the stadium envelope were divided into a number of triangular surface elements triangular polygon for each polygon the radiation fluxes reaching that polygon from the sun sky and surface elements that can be seen from the polygon of interest were summed the mutual solid angles between pairs of surface elements of interest and the inclination of the incident beam with respect to the normal of the surface element were considered in this calculation isotropy was assumed for the reflection from turfgrass and building materials multiple reflections of radiation up to the second order were taken into account because the surface albedos of turfgrass and building materials which ranged from 0 15 the concrete stands and roof to 0 25 turfgrass pielke 1984 allowed us to neglect contributions from higher order reflections the weather classification and the open closed state of the retractable roof were also considered as follows a time series data of solar radiation reaching each grid on the pitch were calculated in 30 min intervals over 1 day for the 12 combinations of three roof states open closed and half closed and four weather classifications every 10 days between january 5 and december 25 b since the time series data of solar radiation derived in step a were calculated every 10 days the data for days in the interval 1 10 were complemented by the 10 day data using linear interpolation with respect to time using steps a and b time series data for solar radiation of each grid in the pitch in 30 min intervals over 365 days were obtained for all combinations of the four weather classes and three states of the retractable roof the solar radiation fluxes s w m 2 were written to files with the month mm day dd time in 30 min intervals time roof state roof weather classification weather and the position of the grid on the pitch i j as follows a1 s s m m d d t i m e r o o f w e a t h e r i j using the above procedures basic solar radiation datasets were prepared before calculating the multilayer model for gas exchange and vegetation growth decline c the time series data of solar radiation corresponding to changes in the weather and roof states were used for input data to the multilayer model for gas exchange and also the vegetation growth decline model weather data were obtained from an adjacent meteorological observatory and the roof states were obtained from the annual record the retracting roof in detail weather classifications on a specific day and at a specific time were determined based on the cloud amount at the meteorological observatory the solar radiation data at a certain time was chosen from the data set described above corresponding to the weather classification and roof states when these operations were performed in 30 min intervals for 1 year the annual solar radiation data at all grid points i j on the pitch were obtained corresponding to the actual changes in the weather and roof states the procedure for partitioning the solar radiation into direct and diffuse components is applicable to other stadiums if data at a meteorological observatory near the stadium are used appendix b distribution of model parameters by the relative irradiance of each grid parameters dependent on relative irradiance are shown in tables 3 and 4 and fig b1 the relative irradiance is the annual average of solar radiation at a certain within stadium position divided by that of solar radiation outside the stadium each parameter was classified into four grades relative irradiances 0 0 39 0 4 0 59 0 6 0 79 and 0 8 1 0 the parameters for each plot tables 3 and 4 were assigned to the four grades each parameter in tables 3 and 4 and fig b1 corresponds to a median relative irradiance between the upper and lower limit of each grade the parameter values at points that differed from this median value were complemented by values corresponding to the upper and lower grades thus the complement equation characterizes the relative irradiance r and the parameter f as

25106,the patch spraying of weeds is an area of precision agriculture that has had limited uptake this is in part due to the perceived risks associated with not controlling individual weeds nevertheless the inherent patchiness of weeds makes them ideal targets for site specific management we propose using a mechanistic model to identify areas of a field vulnerable to invasion by weeds allowing the creation of treatment maps that are risk averse we developed a spatially explicit mechanistic model of the life cycle of alopecurus myosuroides a particularly problematic weed of cereal crops in the uk in the model soil conditions which vary across the field affect the life cycle of a myosuroides the model was validated using data on the within field distribution of a myosuroides on commercial farms and its co location with soil properties we demonstrate the important role played by soil properties in determining the within field distribution of a myosuroides we also show that scale dependent correlations between a myosuroides and soil properties observed in the field are an emergent property of the modelled dynamics of the a myosuroides life cycle our model could therefore support effective site specific management of a myosuroides within fields by predicting areas that are vulnerable to a myosuroides the usefulness of this model in its ability to predict patch locations for a myosuroides highlights the possibility of using similar models for other species where data are available on the response of the species to various soil properties keywords alopecurus myosuroides life cycle soil properties spatial model patch 1 introduction precision agriculture is already commonplace in many aspects of farming information based management systems to adapt fertilizer distribution across the field were first introduced in the mid 1980s gebbers and adamchuk 2010 and since then precision farming techniques including gps steering soil mapping and variable rate seeding are becoming increasingly popular with the proportion of uk farmers who implement these techniques increasing over recent years defra 2013 the concept of site specific weed management specifically patch spraying is less prevalent but is gathering interest site specific weed management takes into account the spatial variability of weeds either through intermittent spraying based on observed weed density at different locations or by modelling the thresholds for weed density above which it is economic to spray garibay et al 2001 this results in reduced chemical cost and more accurate application of control practices dieleman et al 2000 despite the economic and environmental benefits of patch spraying for weed management it has not been readily taken up as a standard management tool there are many reasons for this christensen et al 2009 but perhaps the most important is that a change to patch spraying goes against current practice an unwillingness to implement site specific weed management may stem from the perceived risk of missing individuals that grow outside of currently established patches and are not detected by weed mapping individuals may enter the field from elsewhere or a patch may expand due to increased dispersal from highly dense patches or through cultivation if these individuals remain unsprayed there is a risk they will turn into new patches the incorporation of buffer zones into spray maps is a general measure taken to try and combat this however this does not account for seed spreading outside of the immediate area surrounding the patch or entering the field from elsewhere despite the reservations of farmers in using precision agriculture techniques in weed control many weed species lend themselves well to site specific control due to their patchy distributions within fields in recent years the idea of studying the spatial distribution of weeds with the intent to introduce a site specific aspect to their management has been an area of growing interest the introduction of satellite spatial technology in the 1990s introduced the possibility of locating weed patches in the field lutman et al 2002 and this is now being explored further with the use of unmanned aerial vehicles e g castaldi et al 2016 lópez granados et al 2016a b pérez ortiz et al 2016 research on the real time mapping of weeds e g murdoch et al 2010 tian et al 2000 is also ongoing we focus here on alopecurus myosuroides huds black grass a common grass weed of winter cereals in north west europe holm et al 1997 it is particularly problematic due to its fast reproductive rate strong competitive ability with the crop and because its life cycle is largely synchronised with that of winter cereals maréchal et al 2012 alopecurus myosuroides plants can produce large amounts of seeds moss 1980 meaning small failures in control can lead to rapid population growth and dense infestations within fields currently the main means by which farmers choose to control this pernicious weed is through broadcast application of herbicides however the decreasing number of chemical products available for use and increasing economic and environmental pressures to reduce herbicide use puts a growing emphasis on the optimisation of current techniques and finding alternative approaches grundy 2003 the within field distribution of a myosuroides is patchy wilson and brain 1991 krohmann et al 2006 metcalfe et al 2016 2018b and as such this presents an opportunity for site specific management it has been shown that the patchy distribution of a myosuroides in fields can be related to variation in soil properties holm et al 1997 lutman et al 2002 murdoch et al 2014 metcalfe et al 2016 2018b particularly soil organic matter ph and water metcalfe et al 2018b demonstrated that these relationships are strongest at coarse scales 20 m making them ideal for the implementation of precision management this provides a basis upon which to identify weed vulnerable zones within fields for this species however a biological model that elucidates the underlying processes and causality of these relationships could potentially be used to assess the relative propensity of other species to form patches based on their ecophysiology moss 1990 constructed a basic life cycle model of a myosuroides colbach et al 2006 2007 added more complexity to their life cycle model for a myosuroides alomysys most weed population dynamics models ignore the within field distribution of the weed and generally simulate the average density holst et al 2007 paice et al 1998 however considered the need for a spatial component to models of a myosuroides population dynamics building on basic models of the a myosuroides life cycle they incorporated elements of stochasticity into the life cycle processes and included a binomial probability of weed survival following herbicide application they included both isotropic and anisotropic dispersal processes derived from howard et al 1991 they showed that when dispersal only occurs over short distances patchiness is maintained and even if the field is initialised with a uniform seed bank the population will develop patches in a homogeneous environment gonzalez andujar et al 1999 also considered spatial patterns in the modelling of a myosuroides in an array of hexagons representing part of a field seed dispersal was assumed to be isotropic and dispersal by the combine was also considered the inclusion of features such as seed dispersal in spatial models are often not sufficient to describe the degree of patchiness observed in field populations it is thought that this may be due to the omission of the effect of soil variables paice et al 1998 rew and cousens 2001 dunker et al 2002 included the effect of nutrients soil ph and particle size on a myosuroides in their model based on the results of a pot experiment they verified this model in one field where a myosuroides counts and soil properties were measured on a 50 m 50 m grid their model was based on the demographic data from moss 1990 in the dunker et al 2002 model only the early parts of the life cycle are affected by soil as the experiment on which they based their model was only conducted for 5 weeks post germination they found their simulations to be only weakly correlated with real data and only 4 out of 20 simulations showed a significant correlation our aim was to develop a model to help address the risk associated with current patch spraying techniques of missing individuals that disperse outside of currently established patches we propose an extension to current techniques for mapping weeds which addresses this concern that is to identify parts of the field that are vulnerable to weed infestation these weed vulnerable zones can then be used to guide the precision application of herbicides to do this we develop a spatially explicit model of the life cycle model of a myosuroides incorporating mechanistic responses to soil variability across the whole life cycle the model is based on the work of moss 1990 colbach et al 2006 and paice et al 1998 but extended to include the direct and indirect effect of soil on the weed based on experimental data it also introduces stochasticity into the system providing a more realistic range of possible outcomes than could a deterministic model by modifying the life cycle of the plant according to known responses to variation in soil properties including texture organic matter water and ph we tested the hypothesis that scale dependent relationships between soil properties including soil organic matter water content and ph and the density of a myosuroides observed in fields by metcalfe et al 2018b can be modelled our model strikes a balance between tractability and complexity processes are only modelled mechanistically to capture the effect of different soil properties it was built to answer the specific hypothesis that the heterogeneous environment impacts on population dynamics resulting in scale dependent correlations between soil properties and a myosuroides distributions and does not claim to predict absolute numbers but rather the relative fitness in different within field locations 2 model description we developed a spatially explicit model of a myosuroides population densities within a field incorporating various processes throughout the plant s life cycle the model is described here and the parameterisation detailed in the following section the modelled field is described by a grid of square cells the side length of which can be defined in real units of distance we define the relative position of these cells in cartesian coordinates and so a rectangular area of defined size can be simulated allowing spatial processes such as dispersal between cells for each grid cell we define values for soil texture clay and silt soil ph soil organic matter soil gravimetric water content slope and aspect at a resolution consistent with the chosen grid size 2 1 soil water content soil water content is dynamic and changes over time according to weather and other soil properties plant available water given as soil volumetric water content s vwc is calculated by 1 s vwc s gwc d b 100 where s gwc is the soil gravimetric water content set for the cell and d b is the bulk density of the soil which is calculated using the pedotransfer function 2 d b 0 80806 0 823844 exp 0 27993 s som 0 0014065 100 s clay s silt 0 0010299 s clay derived by hollis et al 2012 for cultivated topsoil where s som is the soil organic matter s clay is the soil clay content and s silt is the soil silt content we modelled the change in volumetric water content of the soil on a daily time step with additions from daily precipitation and losses from evapotranspiration evapotranspiration was calculated for a bare soil surface in the autumn and a crop canopy at other times of the year for these calculations we followed the analysis by penman frere and popov 1979 penman 1948 1956 1963 the penman formulae are dependent on the evaporative demand of the atmosphere and the net absorbed radiation which are calculated using daily temperature solar irradiation vapour pressure and wind speed other required values including reference values for albedo and constants used in the formulae were taken from fao guidelines for computing crop water requirements allen et al 1998 we modify the solar irradiation from the input weather data according to topography shown to be an important determinant of a myosuroides patch location by metcalfe et al 2018b before using it in the penman calculations we split daily irradiation into its direct and diffuse component parts according to the latitude kropff 1993 kropff et al 1993 each cell irrespective of topography received the full amount of diffuse irradiation but the direct component was modified according to the slope and aspect of the field in each cell by scaling it up or down relative to a reference value for a flat field so that steep south facing slopes received more direct radiation than shallow or north facing slopes frank and lee 1966 as water potential of soil varies with soil type we calculate this using the van genuchten pedotransfer function van genuchten 1980 as parameterised by wösten et al 1999 which allows conversion between volumetric water content and water potential according to the soil clay silt and organic matter content and the bulk density of the soil if the water potential exceeds 15 000 mbar then we assume the grid cell has reached wilting point and no more water can be lost conversely if the water potential drops below 50 mbar then the field is at capacity and any additional water input will drain through and so the water content of the soil does not increase wösten et al 1999 2 2 a myosuroides life cycle the life cycle of a myosuroides is modelled in 4 main stages seedlings mature plants viable seed and the seedbank as described by moss 1990 in each iteration of the model there are two cohorts of seeds in each of two soil layers new seeds shed in the previous year and old seeds shed in any year prior each stage of the life cycle is connected to the next by one or more processes see fig 1 the life cycle runs independently in each grid cell with various processes being affected by the soil properties associated with that cell we identified the key transitions in the life cycle that we expected to respond to variability in soil properties table 1 we included additional functions described below in the model to predict the effects of variable soil properties on the whole life cycle 2 2 1 a myosuroides emergence we calculate the number of a myosuroides seedlings that emerge by taking the number of seeds in the soil surface layer and multiplying this by the proportion of seeds germinating g we model the proportion of seeds that germinate g as a function of hydrothermal time θ ht following colbach et al 2006 3 g m 1 e k θ ht t a a x 50 a c when x a t a g 0 otherwise where m is the maximum level of germination a is the lag phase of germination c is a shape parameter and x 50 is the time to 50 germination these parameters are modelled according to properties relating to the seeds see supplementary material for calculations including the age of the seed which allows different values of g for the old and new seed cohorts time from germination to maturity julian day of maturity drawn from a normal distribution of the mother plants water deficit between flowering julian day of flowering drawn from a normal distribution and maturity depth of seed hydrothermal time spent in darkness prior to tillage mean seed mass and total available nitrogen the offset t a increases the delay before the commencement of germination we calculate the water deficit experienced by the parent plants from the previous flowering to previous harvest by taking the difference between the daily evapotranspiration and the sum of the soil water content and daily precipitation if more water is lost to evapotranspiration than is available then this difference is added on to the water deficit hydrothermal time θ ht is accumulated on a daily timestep from the day of tillage julian day of tillage drawn from a normal distribution for a maximum of 50 days by 4 θ ht θ h θ t where 5 θ h ψ ψ b if ψ ψ b θ h 0 otherwise and 6 θ t t t b if t t b θ t 0 otherwise ψ is the daily water potential mpa and t is the daily temperature c ψ b and t b are the base water potential and temperatures required for germination respectively crop germination is much less variable than that of the weed due to their larger seeds and breeding efforts toward uniform establishment stratonovitch et al 2012 and so is modelled by thermal time it is assumed to be unaffected by the soil using a function from storkey and cussans 2000 which divides the crop green area a g eq 7 by the area of the cell if the crop green area index reaches 0 5 before day 50 then a myosuroides germination is terminated at that point 7 a g c m g m ln 1 exp g m t sum t 0 10 000 where c m is a maximum growth rate g plant 1 d 1 g m is a maximum relative growth rate d 1 t sum is the accumulated time from the day of tillage and t 0 is the time at which the plant effectively reaches a linear phase of growth d 2 2 2 herbicide mortality the number of plants surviving herbicide application is drawn from a binomial distribution 8 p i t p t i p i 1 p t i where p i is the probability of i plants surviving from an initial number of t plants in the cell given a probability p of survival pre emergence herbicide efficacy is known to be reduced with increasing organic matter this can have an indirect effect on the life cycle of the weed as on some soils there will be an increased number of survivors pederson et al 1995 metcalfe et al 2018a so to model the proportion of plants surviving pre emergence herbicide application the value of p used to draw from the binomial distribution eq 8 is modelled by 9 p η s som 1 ζ s som τ where s som is the percentage soil organic matter 2 2 3 seed production seed head production is density dependent and so we model the number of heads per cell d heads by 10 d heads β d plants 1 α d plants t a p where d plants is the number of plants per cell moss et al 2010 and t a p is the mean ratio of actual to potential soil transpiration given by eq 11 over the growing season this accounts for the effect of water stress on plant yield osakabe et al 2014 11 t a p 1 1 ϵ exp ρ f tsw we calculate the fraction of transpirable soil water f tsw by taking the average of the daily soil volumetric water contents from the start of germination to the start of flowering as a proportion of the difference between field capacity and wilting point for that soil type the number of seeds produced per head is stochastic and is sampled from a log normal distribution a proportion of this total seed production will be non viable and is sampled stochastically from a normal distribution 2 2 4 seed losses the amount of seed lost for example from predation is sampled from a lognormal distribution and seed survival in the soil is sampled from a normal distribution 2 2 5 seed movement we modelled both natural a myosuroides seed dispersal and dispersal of seed by cultivation the probability distribution for each dispersal process was calculated by numerical integration as 12 p m n s n 0 5 s n 0 5 s m 0 5 s m 0 5 f x y dx dy where s is the side length of the cell p m n is the probability of a seed falling into a cell at the distance from the source x m y n and f x y is the dispersal probability function natural dispersal the natural dispersal of a myosuroides seed is assumed to be isotropic and to follow the rotated gaussian distribution 13 f x y 1 2 π σ 2 exp 0 5 x μ σ 2 y μ σ 2 paice et al 1998 the probability of seed falling into each cell is calculated in turn by eq 12 following the order indicated in fig 2 until a total proportion of 0 999 has been accounted for if any seeds remain these are dispersed to a randomly allocated cell to represent other sources of seed dispersal not accounted for here the resulting list of proportions are stored and used throughout each yearly cycle of the model to move seeds from one cell to nearby cells seed movement by cultivation dispersal by cultivation is anisotropic with seeds being dispersed in the direction of travel lutman et al 2002 in order to model the way in which seeds were moved by the combine we assumed 14 f x y γ 2 exp γ 2 2 ε γ λ 2 2 x erfc ε γ λ 2 x 2 λ this distribution matches the shape of that described by paice et al 1998 for anisotropic dispersal of seeds the distribution is integrated for each grid cell in turn for a maximum of five grid cells in the direction opposite to the direction of travel and then towards the direction of travel until a total proportion of 0 999 is accounted for any remaining seeds are randomly allocated to a grid cell in the direction of travel up to a maximum dispersal distance of 20 m the direction of travel is set up along the x axis of the grid from west to east for the first set of rows up to the width of the cultivator 40 m it is then switched to travel east to west the direction changes every time the number of rows reaches a multiple of the cultivator width for both natural dispersal and the seed movement by cultivation if seeds are to be moved into a cell that lies outside of the model arena the process is reflected such that there is no immigration or emigration of seeds to and from the field this is representative of a real field where boundaries are a source of seed marshall 1989 vertical movement of seed in the soil seeds are moved vertically between the shallow and deep soil layers the tillage type can be set for each year to one of 4 types plough 20 cm tine 10 cm tine or 5 cm tine in years when the tillage is plough a proportion of seeds from the shallow soil layer are buried into the deep soil layer conversely some seeds are brought up to the shallow soil layer for all other tillage types there is no upward movement of seed from the deep soil layer to the shallow soil layer but a proportion of seeds are buried according to the depth of tillage 3 model parameterisation where possible each function in the life cycle model was parameterised using data from the literature however the effect of soil organic matter and its influence on water holding capacity on a myosuroides emergence and seed production was identified as a knowledge gap and so we set up an experiment under controlled conditions in order to parameterise these functions within the model see supplementary material for experimental details 3 1 a myosuroides emergence colbach et al s parameterisation of eq 3 2006 see supplementary material relies on information about the germinating seeds including the age and seed mass to determine whether this parameterisation works on soils with very different water holding capacities we germinated seeds of known origin age and size on soil with different levels of organic matter see supplementary material the data from this experiment supported the shape of the colbach curve but the offset parameter t a is increased to 49 169 in our fit fig 3 this offset increased the delay before the commencemenrt of germination to match the mean of our four treatments fig 3 germination counts on different levels of soil ph collected by metcalfe et al 2017 show that the asymptote for germination is higher when soil ph is low we therefore included a ph threshold of 6 5 in our model at ph levels below this threshold m eq 3 is increased by the ratio of the values for the asymptote of the curves fitted to the low and high ph treatments respectively 40 92 36 72 metcalfe et al 2017 in the parameterisation of eq 3 and eqs 18 26 in the supplementary materials we set the age of the old cohort of seeds to 818 days and the new cohort to 60 days changing this parameter allowed the germination of seeds to occur at different rates the mean julian day of tillage flowering of a myosuroides and maturity of a myosuroides were set to be 258 150 and 206 with respective variances 8 3 and 6 these were determined using field data from a series of field experiments reported in storkey and cussans 2007 on a myosuroides competition in winter wheat sown in the autumn and managed according to standard farm protocols except for the absence of herbicide depth was set to 1 5 cm and mean seed mass determined by weighing 100 seeds was 0 0014 g total available nitrogen was set at 25 kg ha following colbach et al 2002a b the base temperature t b and water potential ψ b for a myosuroides eqs 4 6 were set at 0 c and 1 53 mpa respectively 3 2 herbicide mortality we modelled the survival rate of a myosuroides after the application of pre emergence herbicides using data from metcalfe et al 2018a we took the data points for the proportion of seedlings surviving an application of pre emergence herbicide at a dose equivalent to field rate on different soils and plotted this against the organic matter in the soil and fitted eq 9 to the data the fitted values were η 4 9 ζ 3 8252 and τ 1 0890 see supplementary figure s 3 for post emergence herbicide application we assume no effect of soil variability on contact herbicide efficacy and so p was fixed at 0 3 bayer cropscience 2017 3 3 seed production moss et al 2010 parameterised their model of density dependent head production eq 10 with data from 16 field experiments to give parameter values β 8 71 and α 0 005741 we adjusted this equation to account for soil organic matter according to the results from our experiment see supplementary material we only had one plant per pot in our experiment and so we would not expect this to be representative of the number of heads produced under field conditions but assumed the relative differences were representative of those seen under field conditions this allowed us to compute a generic relationships between soil organic matter and the density dependent relationship between plants and heads see supplementary material for derivation parameters in eq 11 were derived for a myosuroides as ϵ 6 88 and ρ 4 61 from a series of glasshouse experiments reported in storkey and cussans 2007 the mean 4 58 and standard deviation 0 23 of the lognormal distribution used to determine seed production per head are estimated from data provided by moss 1990 the normal distribution n 0 55 0 126 is used to draw values for the proportion of viable seed the mean and standard deviation are again estimated from the data provided by moss 1990 3 4 seed losses for the distributions used to calculate seed losses data from moss 1990 were again used to estimate the means and standard deviations the distributions used were log normal 0 81 0 13 for above ground seed losses e g through predation and n 0 3 0 077 for seed survival in the soil 3 5 seed movement as was described by paice et al 1998 the mean μ of the natural dispersal distribution eq 13 is set at 0 and the standard deviation σ at 0 3 for seed movement by cultivation eq 14 parameters were set to γ 10 3 λ 0 1 and ε 0 15 to best match the shape of the distribution described by paice et al 1998 for anisotropic dispersal of seeds the proportion of seeds moved vertically in the soil for each type of tillage was described by moss 1990 here stochasticity is added by drawing these from distributions estimated from the mean and range of that original data table 2 4 model validation metcalfe et al 2018b linked a myosuroides seedling counts to various environmental properties within fields commercially producing winter wheat they sampled 136 locations in each field using an unbalanced nested sampling design with pairs of points separated by fixed distances at each sampling point they counted the number of a myosuroides seedlings emerging in the autumn they also took soil cores to analytically determine the soil clay and silt content soil organic matter soil ph and soil gravimetric water content the nested design structure allowed the partitioning of the components of variance for both a myosuroides and soil properties at each of the spatial scales studied using the residual maximum likelihood reml estimator as described by metcalfe et al 2016 and scale dependent correlations between a myosuroides counts and soil properties were calculated 4 1 patch location to validate our model we simulated three uk fields for which complete datasets on soil properties and weed densities were available studied by metcalfe et al 2018b the three fields were harpenden hertfordshire redbourn hertfordshire and haversham buckinghamshire see metcalfe et al 2018b as an initial investigation we kriged the measured soil data to predict on a 1 m grid we then used this to parameterise the cells in the model we simulated 40 years of weed growth starting with an initial seed bed of 10 000 seeds per cell 20 of which were in the top soil layer as we did not know the tillage history of the studied fields we simulated three typical tillage systems i rotational cultivation with three years of tillage at 5 cm followed by one year using the plough ii tillage at 10 cm and iii tillage at 5 cm we ran the model with all required input weather data on a daily timestep from rothamsted met station hertfordshire uk beginning with data from 1966 we discarded the simulation results from the first 10 years to allow the patches to stabilise following the initial seeding we recorded and mapped the average number of plants simulated at each location in the field 1 m 1 m grid cell across years 11 40 and for 10 different simulations of the model a total of 300 realisations of the field we then compared these maps with the kriged distribution of a myosuroides plants obtained by metcalfe et al 2018b for that field 4 2 scale dependent correlations we wanted to see if the scale dependent relationships between a myosuroides and soil properties found in the field by metcalfe et al 2018b were an emergent property of the model to do this we needed to simulate soil realistic of that found in the fields but that maintained fine scale variation which is lost in the kriged maps we simulated soil properties on a 1 m 1 m grid using lower upper decomposition of the covariance matrix also known as the cholesky decomposition technique webster and oliver 2007 chapter 12 we created the covariance matrix for each soil property in each field from the covariance function corresponding to the spherical variogram fitted to the soil data and conditioned the simulation to include our measured soil properties at the location where they were measured the r conditioning data were transformed to standard normal form denoted by the vector z and the values at s unsampled positions were drawn independently at random from a standard normal distribution vector g to obtain the vector of conditionally simulated values y we used 15 y z r l sr l ss 1 l rr g s where l is the lower triangular matrix obtained from the decomposition of the covariance matrix for the field following the simulation of the soil we scaled the simulated values to match the mean and range of the original data values 16 y x m s s obs m obs where x is a simulated value m and s are the mean and standard deviation respectively of all the simulated values for that soil property and m obs and s obs are the mean and standard deviation respectively for the observed data ideally we would have simulated all soil properties based on their covariances however due to the size of the field and the spatial scale of simulation this was not possible and so we performed a number of checks to prevent the simulation of impossible soil distributions we checked that the scaled simulated values did not exceed realistic ranges for these soil properties and discarded any simulations falling outside of the acceptable range we also checked that the simulated clay and silt values did not sum to values greater than 100 and so we paired simulations accordingly we produced 35 suitable simulations for each soil property for the harpenden and haversham fields the redbourn field was too large to simulate in this way we simulated 40 years of weed growth starting with an initial seed bed of 10 000 seeds per cell 20 of which were in the top soil layer we implemented 10 cm tine as the tillage type we ran the model with weather data from rothamsted met station hertfordshire uk beginning with data from 1966 we took the output of the model only for years 11 40 from each simulation and extracted the number of simulated a myosuroides plants at each of the sampling locations from the original study metcalfe et al 2018b we did the same analysis of the nested sampling design as described by metcalfe et al 2016 to give scale dependent correlation coefficients between the simulated a myosuroides counts and each soil property present in the model clay organic matter ph and water for each of the 1050 realisations of the field we plotted a histogram to look at the frequency of these correlations across all 1050 realisations of the field given by the model and compared this distribution to the value obtained in the field data for each spatial scale and each soil property metcalfe et al 2018b 5 results 5 1 patch location the locations of the patches predicted by the model were broadly similar to those observed in the field study fig 4 at a coarse scale there are broad similarities between the distribution of a myosuroides observed in the field and the predicted distributions from the model for all fields in harpenden the rotational ploughing system led to very similar distributions whereas the other two tillage systems 10 cm tine and 5 cm tine showed much more uniform distributions across the field fig 4a d for the field in redbourn the a myosuroides counts in the eastern part of the field were reflected in the predictions as were the low counts in the southern part of the field however in the west the observed and predicted distributions differ fig 4i l finally in haversham the western part of the field shows similar patch locations to those observed in the field fig 4e h in all cases the predicted seedling densities are larger than were observed in the field and the patches more extensive 5 2 scale dependent correlations the scale dependent correlations between a myosuroides and clay were fairly consistent with those observed in the field at coarse scales the model simulations largely resulted in large positive correlations figs 5a and 6 a for harpenden this was close to the observed correlation in the field of 0 85 and for haversham the simulated correlations were often larger than that observed in the field 0 55 whereas at intermediate scales figs 5b d and 6 b d where the observed correlation in the field were weaker the prediction from the models were less conclusive with a range of correlation coefficients that included both positive and negative values at the finest scale all correlations between clay content and the simulated a myosuroides seedling densities were small and often close to zero this reflects the non significant correlations observed in harpenden and haversham fields the results were similar for the relationships predicted between soil organic matter and a myosuroides seedling densities with the model predicting large positive relationships with organic matter at coarse scales figs 5f and 6 f there was no distinct pattern in the correlation coefficients at intermediate scales in harpenden fig 5g i and only small positive correlations at intermediate scales in haversham fig 6g and h which were similar to the observed correlations of 0 22 and 0 62 at those scales in both fields there were correlation coefficients close to zero at the finest scale between soil organic matter and a myosuroides figs 5j and 6 j when we consider ph and its relationship with a myosuroides seedling densities in the harpenden field we find a large peak of positive correlation coefficients at coarse scales fig 5k which is in contrast to the negative correlation coefficient observed int he field again at intermediate scales fig 5l n there is no distinct pattern in the correlation coefficients and at fine scales all correlation coefficients are close to zero in haversham the reml model used to partition the variance across scales could not be fitted to the field data and so no comparison can be made with the simulated model outputs we found positive relationships with soil moisture content at the coarse scale in the majority of simulations figs 5p and 6 p this result matched the significant positive correlation we found in the fields at this spatial scale at intermediate scales figs 5q s and 6 q s the correlations between soil water content and a myosuroides densities predicted by the model were less consistent at the finest scale figs 5t and 6 t the relationship between soil water content and a myosuroides seedling counts predicted by the model was often close to zero in both fields however at this fine scale our field observations gave quite large correlations and lay outside of the distribution of correlations predicted by our model 6 discussion our results support in field studies lutman et al 2002 murdoch et al 2014 metcalfe et al 2018b that show soil is an important determinant in the within field distribution of a myosuroides our results suggest that our model can provide a good prediction of the location of patches within fields irrespective of the tillage type implemented in the model the spatial distribution of a myosuroides seedlings across 300 realisations was consistent with observed field distributions fig 4 this indicates the usefulness of this model in locating a myosuroides vulnerable zones within fields simulated seedling densities were quite different under the different tillage types yet all provided a good estimation of patch location this supports the conclusions from colbach et al 2000 that densities are often highly variable and so the prediction of densities is less accurate than the prediction of patch location this means that it is possible to predict patch locations or weed vulnerable zones irrespective of the tillage practices in place on a farm making the model useful as a decision support tool as it is not necessary to provide all the information about cultivation history in order to locate weed vulnerable zones our model was built to answer the question of the impact of soil variation on the distribution of the weed and so relative abundances are a useful output and absolute values are not particularly important strong coarse scale relationships between soil properties and a myosuroides distributions are an emergent property of our model these matched those observed in field this is important as it is at these coarse scales that in field correlations are strongest metcalfe et al 2016 2018b and so it is important that our model corroborates these observations in the application of site specific weed management most farm machinery operates at coarse scales as such if we can input pre existing or supplemented soil maps already in use on farm for other site specific management practices then we should be able to predict the likelihood of parts of the field being vulnerable to a myosuroides and so be able to develop maps for patch spraying based on the output of this model as with all models of weed population dynamics there are some limitations to this model including a lack of field data and the adoption of number of assumptions however these are necessary in order to keep the model simple enough to be functional whilst retaining enough detail to understand the system fernandez quintanilla 1988 initially some of the limitations of the model come due to a lack of field data and are also under represented in other models of a myosuroides such as those by moss 1990 and colbach et al 2006 these include the fate of seeds after shedding where we have included a certain amount of seed loss but this is an all encompassing figure including predation and decay which would be difficult to model mechanistically similarly for other life cycle processes where we only have information on the range and mean of field data such as seed production in these cases we draw values stochastically but the chosen values remain unaffected by other processes within the life cycle in our model we assume that the density of the crop and other weeds are uniform across the field and so spatial variability in interspecific competition is excluded as we base this model on the premise that the field is a heterogeneous environment this may not be a correct assumption to make however it is an assumption that is also made in other models for patch spraying purposes e g paice et al 1998 in this regard our model could be improved by modelling interspecific competition mechanistically in order to simplify the model we have divided the soil into two layers a shallow layer from which seeds can germinate and a deep layer however in reality the soil is a continuum and there will be a gradient over which seeds can germinate at different rates finally natural seed dispersal is barochorous in our model and seeds are moved by the combine and cultivator both of these methods of dispersal are independent of other factors yet it has been shown that there can be some influence of wind speed on seed dispersal of a myosuroides colbach and sache 2001 and equally seed movement in the soil can depend on soil properties benvenuti 2007 in our model validation the large scale correlations between a myosuroides and soil properties were generally similar to those observed in the field however for soil ph our simulations predicted positive correlations at large scales whereas the observed data showed a negative correlation the only role of soil ph in our model is in altering the asymptote reached in germination we implemented this using a threshold approach where the asymptote for germination is increased when soil ph is below 6 5 it is possible that this is insufficient to describe the true nature of the impact of soil ph on germination as by only changing the asymptote we will only see these differences in years when there are very large numbers of seeds germinating it is likely that the observed response to ph in the field data is a product of additional processes to do with growth and competition in the established phase that are not currently captured in the model the usefulness of our model in its ability to predict patch locations for a myosuroides highlights the possibility of using similar models for other species where data are available on the response of the species to various soil properties this model could be used for other grass weeds with similar life cycles and the key aspects of the life cycle altered to fit with known responses of that species to environmental properties this would allow the prediction of patches of problematic weed species based on soil maps and could be used in conjunction with current patch mapping activities to zone fields for site specific weed management at the appropriate scale 7 conclusions we have drawn together experimental data on the impact of soil properties on the life cycle and management of this important agricultural species and through a modelling approach demonstrated the important role played by soil properties in determining the within field distribution of a myosuroides we have also shown that scale dependent correlations between a myosuroides and soil properties observed in the field are an emergent property of this model which incorporates small changes to individual components of the life cycle due to soil properties this could allow it to become an effective management tool as the coarse scale correlations which are shown to be of the greatest

25106,the patch spraying of weeds is an area of precision agriculture that has had limited uptake this is in part due to the perceived risks associated with not controlling individual weeds nevertheless the inherent patchiness of weeds makes them ideal targets for site specific management we propose using a mechanistic model to identify areas of a field vulnerable to invasion by weeds allowing the creation of treatment maps that are risk averse we developed a spatially explicit mechanistic model of the life cycle of alopecurus myosuroides a particularly problematic weed of cereal crops in the uk in the model soil conditions which vary across the field affect the life cycle of a myosuroides the model was validated using data on the within field distribution of a myosuroides on commercial farms and its co location with soil properties we demonstrate the important role played by soil properties in determining the within field distribution of a myosuroides we also show that scale dependent correlations between a myosuroides and soil properties observed in the field are an emergent property of the modelled dynamics of the a myosuroides life cycle our model could therefore support effective site specific management of a myosuroides within fields by predicting areas that are vulnerable to a myosuroides the usefulness of this model in its ability to predict patch locations for a myosuroides highlights the possibility of using similar models for other species where data are available on the response of the species to various soil properties keywords alopecurus myosuroides life cycle soil properties spatial model patch 1 introduction precision agriculture is already commonplace in many aspects of farming information based management systems to adapt fertilizer distribution across the field were first introduced in the mid 1980s gebbers and adamchuk 2010 and since then precision farming techniques including gps steering soil mapping and variable rate seeding are becoming increasingly popular with the proportion of uk farmers who implement these techniques increasing over recent years defra 2013 the concept of site specific weed management specifically patch spraying is less prevalent but is gathering interest site specific weed management takes into account the spatial variability of weeds either through intermittent spraying based on observed weed density at different locations or by modelling the thresholds for weed density above which it is economic to spray garibay et al 2001 this results in reduced chemical cost and more accurate application of control practices dieleman et al 2000 despite the economic and environmental benefits of patch spraying for weed management it has not been readily taken up as a standard management tool there are many reasons for this christensen et al 2009 but perhaps the most important is that a change to patch spraying goes against current practice an unwillingness to implement site specific weed management may stem from the perceived risk of missing individuals that grow outside of currently established patches and are not detected by weed mapping individuals may enter the field from elsewhere or a patch may expand due to increased dispersal from highly dense patches or through cultivation if these individuals remain unsprayed there is a risk they will turn into new patches the incorporation of buffer zones into spray maps is a general measure taken to try and combat this however this does not account for seed spreading outside of the immediate area surrounding the patch or entering the field from elsewhere despite the reservations of farmers in using precision agriculture techniques in weed control many weed species lend themselves well to site specific control due to their patchy distributions within fields in recent years the idea of studying the spatial distribution of weeds with the intent to introduce a site specific aspect to their management has been an area of growing interest the introduction of satellite spatial technology in the 1990s introduced the possibility of locating weed patches in the field lutman et al 2002 and this is now being explored further with the use of unmanned aerial vehicles e g castaldi et al 2016 lópez granados et al 2016a b pérez ortiz et al 2016 research on the real time mapping of weeds e g murdoch et al 2010 tian et al 2000 is also ongoing we focus here on alopecurus myosuroides huds black grass a common grass weed of winter cereals in north west europe holm et al 1997 it is particularly problematic due to its fast reproductive rate strong competitive ability with the crop and because its life cycle is largely synchronised with that of winter cereals maréchal et al 2012 alopecurus myosuroides plants can produce large amounts of seeds moss 1980 meaning small failures in control can lead to rapid population growth and dense infestations within fields currently the main means by which farmers choose to control this pernicious weed is through broadcast application of herbicides however the decreasing number of chemical products available for use and increasing economic and environmental pressures to reduce herbicide use puts a growing emphasis on the optimisation of current techniques and finding alternative approaches grundy 2003 the within field distribution of a myosuroides is patchy wilson and brain 1991 krohmann et al 2006 metcalfe et al 2016 2018b and as such this presents an opportunity for site specific management it has been shown that the patchy distribution of a myosuroides in fields can be related to variation in soil properties holm et al 1997 lutman et al 2002 murdoch et al 2014 metcalfe et al 2016 2018b particularly soil organic matter ph and water metcalfe et al 2018b demonstrated that these relationships are strongest at coarse scales 20 m making them ideal for the implementation of precision management this provides a basis upon which to identify weed vulnerable zones within fields for this species however a biological model that elucidates the underlying processes and causality of these relationships could potentially be used to assess the relative propensity of other species to form patches based on their ecophysiology moss 1990 constructed a basic life cycle model of a myosuroides colbach et al 2006 2007 added more complexity to their life cycle model for a myosuroides alomysys most weed population dynamics models ignore the within field distribution of the weed and generally simulate the average density holst et al 2007 paice et al 1998 however considered the need for a spatial component to models of a myosuroides population dynamics building on basic models of the a myosuroides life cycle they incorporated elements of stochasticity into the life cycle processes and included a binomial probability of weed survival following herbicide application they included both isotropic and anisotropic dispersal processes derived from howard et al 1991 they showed that when dispersal only occurs over short distances patchiness is maintained and even if the field is initialised with a uniform seed bank the population will develop patches in a homogeneous environment gonzalez andujar et al 1999 also considered spatial patterns in the modelling of a myosuroides in an array of hexagons representing part of a field seed dispersal was assumed to be isotropic and dispersal by the combine was also considered the inclusion of features such as seed dispersal in spatial models are often not sufficient to describe the degree of patchiness observed in field populations it is thought that this may be due to the omission of the effect of soil variables paice et al 1998 rew and cousens 2001 dunker et al 2002 included the effect of nutrients soil ph and particle size on a myosuroides in their model based on the results of a pot experiment they verified this model in one field where a myosuroides counts and soil properties were measured on a 50 m 50 m grid their model was based on the demographic data from moss 1990 in the dunker et al 2002 model only the early parts of the life cycle are affected by soil as the experiment on which they based their model was only conducted for 5 weeks post germination they found their simulations to be only weakly correlated with real data and only 4 out of 20 simulations showed a significant correlation our aim was to develop a model to help address the risk associated with current patch spraying techniques of missing individuals that disperse outside of currently established patches we propose an extension to current techniques for mapping weeds which addresses this concern that is to identify parts of the field that are vulnerable to weed infestation these weed vulnerable zones can then be used to guide the precision application of herbicides to do this we develop a spatially explicit model of the life cycle model of a myosuroides incorporating mechanistic responses to soil variability across the whole life cycle the model is based on the work of moss 1990 colbach et al 2006 and paice et al 1998 but extended to include the direct and indirect effect of soil on the weed based on experimental data it also introduces stochasticity into the system providing a more realistic range of possible outcomes than could a deterministic model by modifying the life cycle of the plant according to known responses to variation in soil properties including texture organic matter water and ph we tested the hypothesis that scale dependent relationships between soil properties including soil organic matter water content and ph and the density of a myosuroides observed in fields by metcalfe et al 2018b can be modelled our model strikes a balance between tractability and complexity processes are only modelled mechanistically to capture the effect of different soil properties it was built to answer the specific hypothesis that the heterogeneous environment impacts on population dynamics resulting in scale dependent correlations between soil properties and a myosuroides distributions and does not claim to predict absolute numbers but rather the relative fitness in different within field locations 2 model description we developed a spatially explicit model of a myosuroides population densities within a field incorporating various processes throughout the plant s life cycle the model is described here and the parameterisation detailed in the following section the modelled field is described by a grid of square cells the side length of which can be defined in real units of distance we define the relative position of these cells in cartesian coordinates and so a rectangular area of defined size can be simulated allowing spatial processes such as dispersal between cells for each grid cell we define values for soil texture clay and silt soil ph soil organic matter soil gravimetric water content slope and aspect at a resolution consistent with the chosen grid size 2 1 soil water content soil water content is dynamic and changes over time according to weather and other soil properties plant available water given as soil volumetric water content s vwc is calculated by 1 s vwc s gwc d b 100 where s gwc is the soil gravimetric water content set for the cell and d b is the bulk density of

where s som is the soil organic matter s clay is the soil clay content and s silt is the soil silt content we modelled the change in volumetric water content of the soil on a daily time step with additions from daily precipitation and losses from evapotranspiration evapotranspiration was calculated for a bare soil surface in the autumn and a crop canopy at other times of the year for these calculations we followed the analysis by penman frere and popov 1979 penman 1948 1956 1963 the penman formulae are dependent on the evaporative demand of the atmosphere and the net absorbed radiation which are calculated using daily temperature solar irradiation vapour pressure and wind speed other required values including reference values for albedo and constants used in the formulae were taken from fao guidelines for computing crop water requirements allen et al 1998 we modify the solar irradiation from the input weather data according to topography shown to be an important determinant of a myosuroides patch location by metcalfe et al 2018b before using it in the penman calculations we split daily irradiation into its direct and diffuse component parts according to the latitude kropff 1993 kropff et al 1993 each cell irrespective of topography received the full amount of diffuse irradiation but the direct component was modified according to the slope and aspect of the field in each cell by scaling it up or down relative to a reference value for a flat field so that steep south facing slopes received more direct radiation than shallow or north facing slopes frank and lee 1966 as water potential of soil varies with soil type we calculate this using the van genuchten pedotransfer function van genuchten 1980 as parameterised by wösten et al 1999 which allows conversion between volumetric water content and water potential according to the soil clay silt and organic matter content and the bulk density of the soil if the water potential exceeds 15 000 mbar then we assume the grid cell has reached wilting point and no more water can be lost conversely if the water potential drops below 50 mbar then the field is at capacity and any additional water input will drain through and so the water content of the soil does not increase wösten et al 1999 2 2 a myosuroides life cycle the life cycle of a myosuroides is modelled in 4 main stages seedlings mature plants viable seed and the seedbank as described by moss 1990 in each iteration of the model there are two cohorts of seeds in each of two soil layers new seeds shed in the previous year and old seeds shed in any year prior each stage of the life cycle is connected to the next by one or more processes see fig 1 the life cycle runs independently in each grid cell with various processes being affected by the soil properties associated with that cell we identified the key transitions in the life cycle that we expected to respond to variability in soil properties table 1 we included additional functions described below in the model to predict the effects of variable soil properties on the whole life cycle 2 2 1 a myosuroides emergence we calculate the number of a myosuroides seedlings that emerge by taking the number of seeds in the soil surface layer and multiplying this by the proportion of seeds germinating g we model the proportion of seeds that germinate g as a function of hydrothermal time θ ht following colbach et al 2006 3 g m 1 e k θ ht t a a x 50 a c when x a t a g 0 otherwise where m is the maximum level of germination a is the lag phase of germination c is a shape parameter and x 50 is the time to 50 germination these parameters are modelled according to properties relating to the seeds see supplementary material for calculations including the age of the seed which allows different values of g for the old and new seed cohorts time from germination to maturity julian day of maturity drawn from a normal distribution of the mother plants water deficit between flowering julian day of flowering drawn from a normal distribution and maturity depth of seed hydrothermal time spent in darkness prior to tillage mean seed mass and total available nitrogen the offset t a increases the delay before the commencement of germination we calculate the water deficit experienced by the parent plants from the previous flowering to previous harvest by taking the difference between the daily evapotranspiration and the sum of the soil water content and daily precipitation if more water is lost to evapotranspiration than is available then this difference is added on to the water deficit hydrothermal time θ ht is accumulated on a daily timestep from the day of tillage julian day of tillage drawn from a normal distribution for a maximum of 50 days by 4 θ ht θ h θ t where 5 θ h ψ ψ b if ψ ψ b θ h 0 otherwise and 6 θ t t t b if t t b θ t 0 otherwise ψ is the daily water potential mpa and t is the daily temperature c ψ b and t b are the base water potential and temperatures required for germination respectively crop germination is much less variable than that of the weed due to their larger seeds and breeding efforts toward uniform establishment stratonovitch et al 2012 and so is modelled by thermal time it is assumed to be unaffected by the soil using a function from storkey and cussans 2000 which divides the crop green area a g eq 7 by the area of the cell if the crop green area index reaches 0 5 before day 50 then a myosuroides germination is terminated at that point 7 a g c m g m ln 1 exp g m t sum t 0 10 000 where c m is a maximum growth rate g plant 1 d 1 g m is a maximum relative growth rate d 1 t sum is the accumulated time from the day of tillage and t 0 is the time at which the plant effectively reaches a linear phase of growth d 2 2 2 herbicide mortality the number of plants surviving herbicide application is drawn from a binomial distribution 8 p i t p t i p i 1 p t i where p i is the probability of i plants surviving from an initial number of t plants in the cell given a probability p of survival pre emergence herbicide efficacy is known to be reduced with increasing organic matter this can have an indirect effect on the life cycle of the weed as on some soils there will be an increased number of survivors pederson et al 1995 metcalfe et al 2018a so to model the proportion of plants surviving pre emergence herbicide application the value of p used to draw from the binomial distribution eq 8 is modelled by 9 p η s som 1 ζ s som τ where s som is the percentage soil organic matter 2 2 3 seed production seed head production is density dependent and so we model the number of heads per cell d heads by 10 d heads β d plants 1 α d plants t a p where d plants is the number of plants per cell moss et al 2010 and t a p is the mean ratio of actual to potential soil transpiration given by eq 11 over the growing season this accounts for the effect of water stress on plant yield osakabe et al 2014 11 t a p 1 1 ϵ exp ρ f tsw we calculate the fraction of transpirable soil water f tsw by taking the average of the daily soil volumetric water contents from the start of germination to the start of flowering as a proportion of the difference between field capacity and wilting point for that soil type the number of seeds produced per head is stochastic and is sampled from a log normal distribution a proportion of this total seed production will be non viable and is sampled stochastically from a normal distribution 2 2 4 seed losses the amount of seed lost for example from predation is sampled from a lognormal distribution and seed survival in the soil is sampled from a normal distribution 2 2 5 seed movement we modelled both natural a myosuroides seed dispersal and dispersal of seed by cultivation the probability distribution for each dispersal process was calculated by numerical integration as 12 p m n s n 0 5 s n 0 5 s m 0 5 s m 0 5 f x y dx dy where s is the side length of the cell p m n is the probability of a seed falling into a cell at the distance from the source x m y n and f x y is the dispersal probability function natural dispersal the natural dispersal of a myosuroides seed is assumed to be isotropic and to follow the rotated gaussian distribution 13 f x y 1 2 π σ 2 exp 0 5 x μ σ 2 y μ σ 2 paice et al 1998 the probability of seed falling into each cell is calculated in turn by eq 12 following the order indicated in fig 2 until a total proportion of 0 999 has been accounted for if any seeds remain these are dispersed to a randomly allocated cell to represent other sources of seed dispersal not accounted for here the resulting list of proportions are stored and used throughout each yearly cycle of the model to move seeds from one cell to nearby cells seed movement by cultivation dispersal by cultivation is anisotropic with seeds being dispersed in the direction of travel lutman et al 2002 in order to model the way in which seeds were moved by the combine we assumed 14 f x y γ 2 exp γ 2 2 ε γ λ 2 2 x erfc ε γ λ 2 x 2 λ this distribution matches the shape of that described by paice et al 1998 for anisotropic dispersal of seeds the distribution is integrated for each grid cell in turn for a maximum of five grid cells in the direction opposite to the direction of travel and then towards the direction of travel until a total proportion of 0 999 is accounted for any remaining seeds are randomly allocated to a grid cell in the direction of travel up to a maximum dispersal distance of 20 m the direction of travel is set up along the x axis of the grid from west to east for the first set of rows up to the width of the cultivator 40 m it is then switched to travel east to west the direction changes every time the number of rows reaches a multiple of the cultivator width for both natural dispersal and the seed movement by cultivation if seeds are to be moved into a cell that lies outside of the model arena the process is reflected such that there is no immigration or emigration of seeds to and from the field this is representative of a real field where boundaries are a source of seed marshall 1989 vertical movement of seed in the soil seeds are moved vertically between the shallow and deep soil layers the tillage type can be set for each year to one of 4 types plough 20 cm tine 10 cm tine or 5 cm tine in years when the tillage is plough a proportion of seeds from the shallow soil layer are buried into the deep soil layer conversely some seeds are brought up to the shallow soil layer for all other tillage types there is no upward movement of seed from the deep soil layer to the shallow soil layer but a proportion of seeds are buried according to the depth of tillage 3 model parameterisation where possible each function in the life cycle model was parameterised using data from the literature however the effect of soil organic matter and its influence on water holding capacity on a myosuroides emergence and seed production was identified as a knowledge gap and so we set up an experiment under controlled conditions in order to parameterise these functions within the model see supplementary material for experimental details 3 1 a myosuroides emergence colbach et al s parameterisation of eq 3 2006 see supplementary material relies on information about the germinating seeds including the age and seed mass to determine whether this parameterisation works on soils with very different water holding capacities we germinated seeds of known origin age and size on soil with different levels of organic matter see supplementary material the data from this experiment supported the shape of the colbach curve but the offset parameter t a is increased to 49 169 in our fit fig 3 this offset increased the delay before the commencemenrt of germination to match the mean of our four treatments fig 3 germination counts on different levels of soil ph collected by metcalfe et al 2017 show that the asymptote for germination is higher when soil ph is low we therefore included a ph threshold of 6 5 in our model at ph levels below this threshold m eq 3 is increased by the ratio of the values for the asymptote of the curves fitted to the low and high ph treatments respectively 40 92 36 72 metcalfe et al 2017 in the parameterisation of eq 3 and eqs 18 26 in the supplementary materials we set the age of the old cohort of seeds to 818 days and the new cohort to 60 days changing this parameter allowed the germination of seeds to occur at different rates the mean julian day of tillage flowering of a myosuroides and maturity of a myosuroides were set to be 258 150 and 206 with respective variances 8 3 and 6 these were determined using field data from a series of field experiments reported in storkey and cussans 2007 on a myosuroides competition in winter wheat sown in the autumn and managed according to standard farm protocols except for the absence of herbicide depth was set to 1 5 cm and mean seed mass determined by weighing 100 seeds was 0 0014 g total available nitrogen was set at 25 kg ha following colbach et al 2002a b the base temperature t b and water potential ψ b for a myosuroides eqs 4 6 were set at 0 c and 1 53 mpa respectively 3 2 herbicide mortality we modelled the survival rate of a myosuroides after the application of pre emergence herbicides using data from metcalfe et al 2018a we took the data points for the proportion of seedlings surviving an application of pre emergence herbicide at a dose equivalent to field rate on different soils and plotted this against the organic matter in the soil and fitted eq 9 to the data the fitted values were η 4 9 ζ 3 8252 and τ 1 0890 see supplementary figure s 3 for post emergence herbicide application we assume no effect of soil variability on contact herbicide efficacy and so p was fixed at 0 3 bayer cropscience 2017 3 3 seed production moss et al 2010 parameterised their model of density dependent head production eq 10 with data from 16 field experiments to give parameter values β 8 71 and α 0 005741 we adjusted this equation to account for soil organic matter according to the results from our experiment see supplementary material we only had one plant per pot in our experiment and so we would not expect this to be representative of the number of heads produced under field conditions but assumed the relative differences were representative of those seen under field conditions this allowed us to compute a generic relationships between soil organic matter and the density dependent relationship between plants and heads see supplementary material for derivation parameters in eq 11 were derived for a myosuroides as ϵ 6 88 and ρ 4 61 from a series of glasshouse experiments reported in storkey and cussans 2007 the mean 4 58 and standard deviation 0 23 of the lognormal distribution used to determine seed production per head are estimated from data provided by moss 1990 the normal distribution n 0 55 0 126 is used to draw values for the proportion of viable seed the mean and standard deviation are again estimated from the data provided by moss 1990 3 4 seed losses for the distributions used to calculate seed losses data from moss 1990 were again used to estimate the means and standard deviations the distributions used were log normal 0 81 0 13 for above ground seed losses e g through predation and n 0 3 0 077 for seed survival in the soil 3 5 seed movement as was described by paice et al 1998 the mean μ of the natural dispersal distribution eq 13 is set at 0 and the standard deviation σ at 0 3 for seed movement by cultivation eq 14 parameters were set to γ 10 3 λ 0 1 and ε 0 15 to best match the shape of the distribution described by paice et al 1998 for anisotropic dispersal of seeds the proportion of seeds moved vertically in the soil for each type of tillage was described by moss 1990 here stochasticity is added by drawing these from distributions estimated from the mean and range of that original data table 2 4 model validation metcalfe et al 2018b linked a myosuroides seedling counts to various environmental properties within fields commercially producing winter wheat they sampled 136 locations in each field using an unbalanced nested sampling design with pairs of points separated by fixed distances at each sampling point they counted the number of a myosuroides seedlings emerging in the autumn they also took soil cores to analytically determine the soil clay and silt content soil organic matter soil ph and soil gravimetric water content the nested design structure allowed the partitioning of the components of variance for both a myosuroides and soil properties at each of the spatial scales studied using the residual maximum likelihood reml estimator as described by metcalfe et al 2016 and scale dependent correlations between a myosuroides counts and soil properties were calculated 4 1 patch location to validate our model we simulated three uk fields for which complete datasets on soil properties and weed densities were available studied by metcalfe et al 2018b the three fields were harpenden hertfordshire redbourn hertfordshire and haversham buckinghamshire see metcalfe et al 2018b as an initial investigation we kriged the measured soil data to predict on a 1 m grid we then used this to parameterise the cells in the model we simulated 40 years of weed growth starting with an initial seed bed of 10 000 seeds per cell 20 of which were in the top soil layer as we did not know the tillage history of the studied fields we simulated three typical tillage systems i rotational cultivation with three years of tillage at 5 cm followed by one year using the plough ii tillage at 10 cm and iii tillage at 5 cm we ran the model with all required input weather data on a daily timestep from rothamsted met station hertfordshire uk beginning with data from 1966 we discarded the simulation results from the first 10 years to allow the patches to stabilise following the initial seeding we recorded and mapped the average number of plants simulated at each location in the field 1 m 1 m grid cell across years 11 40 and for 10 different simulations of the model a total of 300 realisations of the field we then compared these maps with the kriged distribution of a myosuroides plants obtained by metcalfe et al 2018b for that field 4 2 scale dependent correlations we wanted to see if the scale dependent relationships between a myosuroides and soil properties found in the field by metcalfe et al 2018b were an emergent property of the model to do this we needed to simulate soil realistic of that found in the fields but that maintained fine scale variation which is lost in the kriged maps we simulated soil properties on a 1 m 1 m grid using lower upper decomposition of the covariance matrix also known as the cholesky decomposition technique webster and oliver 2007 chapter 12 we created the covariance matrix for each soil property in each field from the covariance function corresponding to the spherical variogram fitted to the soil data and conditioned the simulation to include our measured soil properties at the location where they were measured the r conditioning data were transformed to standard normal form denoted by the vector z and the values at s unsampled positions were drawn independently at random from a standard normal distribution vector g to obtain the vector of conditionally simulated values y we used 15 y z r l sr l ss 1 l rr g s where l is the lower triangular matrix obtained from the decomposition of the covariance matrix for the field following the simulation of the soil we scaled the simulated values to match the mean and range of the original data values 16 y x m s s obs m obs where x is a simulated value m and s are the mean and standard deviation respectively of all the simulated values for that soil property and m obs and s obs are the mean and standard deviation respectively for the observed data ideally we would have simulated all soil properties based on their covariances however due to the size of the field and the spatial scale of simulation this was not possible and so we performed a number of checks to prevent the simulation of impossible soil distributions we checked that the scaled simulated values did not exceed realistic ranges for these soil properties and discarded any simulations falling outside of the acceptable range we also checked that the simulated clay and silt values did not sum to values greater than 100 and so we paired simulations accordingly we produced 35 suitable simulations for each soil property for the harpenden and haversham fields the redbourn field was too large to simulate in this way we simulated 40 years of weed growth starting with an initial seed bed of 10 000 seeds per cell 20 of which were in the top soil layer we implemented 10 cm tine as the tillage type we ran the model with weather data from rothamsted met station hertfordshire uk beginning with data from 1966 we took the output of the model only for years 11 40 from each simulation and extracted the number of simulated a myosuroides plants at each of the sampling locations from the original study metcalfe et al 2018b we did the same analysis of the nested sampling design as described by metcalfe et al 2016 to give scale dependent correlation coefficients between the simulated a myosuroides counts and each soil property present in the model clay organic matter ph and water for each of the 1050 realisations of the field we plotted a histogram to look at the frequency of these correlations across all 1050 realisations of the field given by the model and compared this distribution to the value obtained in the field data for each spatial scale and each soil property metcalfe et al 2018b 5 results 5 1 patch location the locations of the patches predicted by the model were broadly similar to those observed in the field study fig 4 at a coarse scale there are broad similarities between the distribution of a myosuroides observed in the field and the predicted distributions from the model for all fields in harpenden the rotational ploughing system led to very similar distributions whereas the other two tillage systems 10 cm tine and 5 cm tine showed much more uniform distributions across the field fig 4a d for the field in redbourn the a myosuroides counts in the eastern part of the field were reflected in the predictions as were the low counts in the southern part of the field however in the west the observed and predicted distributions differ fig 4i l finally in haversham the western part of the field shows similar patch locations to those observed in the field fig 4e h in all cases the predicted seedling densities are larger than were observed in the field and the patches more extensive 5 2 scale dependent correlations the scale dependent correlations between a myosuroides and clay were fairly consistent with those observed in the field at coarse scales the model simulations largely resulted in large positive correlations figs 5a and 6 a for harpenden this was close to the observed correlation in the field of 0 85 and for haversham the simulated correlations were often larger than that observed in the field 0 55 whereas at intermediate scales figs 5b d and 6 b d where the observed correlation in the field were weaker the prediction from the models were less conclusive with a range of correlation coefficients that included both positive and negative values at the finest scale all correlations between clay content and the simulated a myosuroides seedling densities were small and often close to zero this reflects the non significant correlations observed in harpenden and haversham fields the results were similar for the relationships predicted between soil organic matter and a myosuroides seedling densities with the model predicting large positive relationships with organic matter at coarse scales figs 5f and 6 f there was no distinct pattern in the correlation coefficients at intermediate scales in harpenden fig 5g i and only small positive correlations at intermediate scales in haversham fig 6g and h which were similar to the observed correlations of 0 22 and 0 62 at those scales in both fields there were correlation coefficients close to zero at the finest scale between soil organic matter and a myosuroides figs 5j and 6 j when we consider ph and its relationship with a myosuroides seedling densities in the harpenden field we find a large peak of positive correlation coefficients at coarse scales fig 5k which is in contrast to the negative correlation coefficient observed int he field again at intermediate scales fig 5l n there is no distinct pattern in the correlation coefficients and at fine scales all correlation coefficients are close to zero in haversham the reml model used to partition the variance across scales could not be fitted to the field data and so no comparison can be made with the simulated model outputs we found positive relationships with soil moisture content at the coarse scale in the majority of simulations figs 5p and 6 p this result matched the significant positive correlation we found in the fields at this spatial scale at intermediate scales figs 5q s and 6 q s the correlations between soil water content and a myosuroides densities predicted by the model were less consistent at the finest scale figs 5t and 6 t the relationship between soil water content and a myosuroides seedling counts predicted by the model was often close to zero in both fields however at this fine scale our field observations gave quite large correlations and lay outside of the distribution of correlations predicted by our model 6 discussion our results support in field studies lutman et al 2002 murdoch et al 2014 metcalfe et al 2018b that show soil is an important determinant in the within field distribution of a myosuroides our results suggest that our model can provide a good prediction of the location of patches within fields irrespective of the tillage type implemented in the model the spatial distribution of a myosuroides seedlings across 300 realisations was consistent with observed field distributions fig 4 this indicates the usefulness of this model in locating a myosuroides vulnerable zones within fields simulated seedling densities were quite different under the different tillage types yet all provided a good estimation of patch location this supports the conclusions from colbach et al 2000 that densities are often highly variable and so the prediction of densities is less accurate than the prediction of patch location this means that it is possible to predict patch locations or weed vulnerable zones irrespective of the tillage practices in place on a farm making the model useful as a decision support tool as it is not necessary to provide all the information about cultivation history in order to locate weed vulnerable zones our model was built to answer the question of the impact of soil variation on the distribution of the weed and so relative abundances are a useful output and absolute values are not particularly important strong coarse scale relationships between soil properties and a myosuroides distributions are an emergent property of our model these matched those observed in field this is important as it is at these coarse scales that in field correlations are strongest metcalfe et al 2016 2018b and so it is important that our model corroborates these observations in the application of site specific weed management most farm machinery operates at coarse scales as such if we can input pre existing or supplemented soil maps already in use on farm for other site specific management practices then we should be able to predict the likelihood of parts of the field being vulnerable to a myosuroides and so be able to develop maps for patch spraying based on the output of this model as with all models of weed population dynamics there are some limitations to this model including a lack of field data and the adoption of number of assumptions however these are necessary in order to keep the model simple enough to be functional whilst retaining enough detail to understand the system fernandez quintanilla 1988 initially some of the limitations of the model come due to a lack of field data and are also under represented in other models of a myosuroides such as those by moss 1990 and colbach et al 2006 these include the fate of seeds after shedding where we have included a certain amount of seed loss but this is an all encompassing figure including predation and decay which would be difficult to model mechanistically similarly for other life cycle processes where we only have information on the range and mean of field data such as seed production in these cases we draw values stochastically but the chosen values remain unaffected by other processes within the life cycle in our model we assume that the density of the crop and other weeds are uniform across the field and so spatial variability in interspecific competition is excluded as we base this model on the premise that the field is a heterogeneous environment this may not be a correct assumption to make however it is an assumption that is also made in other models for patch spraying purposes e g paice et al 1998 in this regard our model could be improved by modelling interspecific competition mechanistically in order to simplify the model we have divided the soil into two layers a shallow layer from which seeds can germinate and a deep layer however in reality the soil is a continuum and there will be a gradient over which seeds can germinate at different rates finally natural seed dispersal is barochorous in our model and seeds are moved by the combine and cultivator both of these methods of dispersal are independent of other factors yet it has been shown that there can be some influence of wind speed on seed dispersal of a myosuroides colbach and sache 2001 and equally seed movement in the soil can depend on soil properties benvenuti 2007 in our model validation the large scale correlations between a myosuroides and soil properties were generally similar to those observed in the field however for soil ph our simulations predicted positive correlations at large scales whereas the observed data showed a negative correlation the only role of soil ph in our model is in altering the asymptote reached in germination we implemented this using a threshold approach where the asymptote for germination is increased when soil ph is below 6 5 it is possible that this is insufficient to describe the true nature of the impact of soil ph on germination as by only changing the asymptote we will only see these differences in years when there are very large numbers of seeds germinating it is likely that the observed response to ph in the field data is a product of additional processes to do with growth and competition in the established phase that are not currently captured in the model the usefulness of our model in its ability to predict patch locations for a myosuroides highlights the possibility of using similar models for other species where data are available on the response of the species to various soil properties this model could be used for other grass weeds with similar life cycles and the key aspects of the life cycle altered to fit with known responses of that species to environmental properties this would allow the prediction of patches of problematic weed species based on soil maps and could be used in conjunction with current patch mapping activities to zone fields for site specific weed management at the appropriate scale 7 conclusions we have drawn together experimental data on the impact of soil properties on the life cycle and management of this important agricultural species and through a modelling approach demonstrated the important role played by soil properties in determining the within field distribution of a myosuroides we have also shown that scale dependent correlations between a myosuroides and soil properties observed in the field are an emergent property of this model which incorporates small changes to individual components of the life cycle due to soil properties this could allow it to become an effective management tool as the coarse scale correlations which are shown to be of the greatest

25107,measuring dis similarity between ecosystem states is a key theme in ecology much of community and ecosystem ecology is devoted to searching for patterns in ecosystem similarity from an external observer s viewpoint using variables such as species abundances measures of diversity and complexity however from the point of view of organisms in the ecosystem proportional population growth rates are the only relevant aspect of ecosystem state because natural selection acts on groups of organisms with different proportional population growth rates we therefore argue that two ecosystem states are equivalent if and only if for each species they contain the proportional population growth rate does not differ between the states based on this result we develop species level and aggregated summary measures of ecosystem state and discuss their ecological meaning we illustrate our approach using a long term dataset on the plankton community from the central european lake constance we show that the first three principal components of proportional population growth rates describe most of the variation in ecosystem state in lake constance we strongly recommend using proportional population growth rates and the derived equivalence classes for comparative ecosystem studies this opens up new perspectives on important existing topics such as alternative stable ecosystem states community assembly and the processes generating regularities in ecosystems keywords hutchinson niche ecosystem dynamics ecosystem dissimilarity proportional population growth rate per capita growth rate 1 introduction in abstract terms ecosystem ecology is about identifying deep similarities between superficially different ecosystems for example practical problems such as developing ecological indicators niemi and mcdonald 2004 rely on having an appropriate concept of the properties of ecosystems which make them similar or dissimilar widely used properties include abundances ginzburg 1983 p 7 relative abundances legendre and legendre 2012 p 328 diversity jost 2006 complexity of energy flow pathways ulanowicz 1986 and aspects of ecosystem functioning such as productivity and material cycling loreau 2010 chapters 3 and 6 however to an external observer of the ecosystem there does not appear to be any objective way to determine which of these many properties are relevant or how much weight should be given to each this is of practical importance because multiple properties of an ecosystem may change in different ways without an objective way to select and weight these properties different external observers for example government bodies with different priorities may disagree on whether the integrity of an ecosystem has improved or deteriorated between two points in time andreasen et al 2001 in contrast for an organism in an ecosystem the properties that matter and how much weight should be given to each property are determined entirely by the structure of the hutchinson niche an understanding of such structure is therefore essential to the ideas that follow in order to see this we first define proportional population growth rate to mean the rate of change of abundance per unit of abundance for example per capita population growth rate when abundance is measured in individuals or mass specific population growth rate when measured as biomass we require that proportional population growth rate is measurement invariant i e does not depend on the way in which abundance is measured cropp and norbury 2012 hutchinson 1957 defined the niche of an organism as the set of states of the environment permitting a species to persist indefinitely later work makes it clear that by persist indefinitely it was meant that the proportional population growth rate for the species was non negative hutchinson 1978 p 194 thus the dependence of proportional population growth rate on environment is an essential concept in the definition of the hutchinson niche the initial view of niche space was essentially static with a point in niche space representing the fixed values of usually non living resources in an ecosystem maguire 1973 introduced both structure and dynamics into niche space structure was provided by level sets contours if niche space is two dimensional of equal proportional population growth rate and dynamics by movement of ecosystems through niche space driven either by external changes or as a consequence of population growth maguire explicitly stated that this view of niche space allows us to examine the total environment of a species a population or an individual through its biological eyes in other words as an organism within the ecosystem would see it rather than as an external observer of course organisms do not see population growth rate so that the biological eyes of a species must be interpreted as the outcome of the process relating population growth rate to environment exponential growth of a population occurs when nothing happens in the environment ginzburg 1986 in other words exponential growth will occur if and only if the environmental influences on a population do not change turchin 2003 chapter 2 note that in general other populations and the focal population in cases of interference competition are included in the environment this law of exponential growth is a basic principle of population dynamics in a universe without spontaneous generation turchin 2003 p 24 and can be derived using a simple taylor polynomial argument hutchinson 1978 pp 1 3 however it is worth thinking about what the absence of change in environmental influences means with the aid of three cases i it is obvious that if there has been no change in any aspect of the environment then environmental influences have not changed and exponential growth will occur ii if an ecosystem moves through niche space from one level set to another maguire 1973 tilman 1980 fig 1 solid arrow environmental influences are changing proportional population growth rate is changing and population growth is not exponential iii if an ecosystem moves through niche space but remains within a level set fig 1 dashed arrow then although the environment is changing environmental influences on the population do not change proportional population growth rate does not change and population growth is exponential the first and third cases are unlikely to occur in nature but are important conceptually in particular in the third case nothing happens from the point of view of the organism even though to an external observer something is happening in general two ecosystem states which are superficially different can be equivalent from the point of view of a species if they are in the same level set in niche space and therefore lead to the same proportional population growth rate it is necessary to know the structure of the hutchinson niche in order to distinguish between the second and third cases thus the most important aspect of this view of the hutchinson niche is that the map from environment to proportional population growth rates tells us exactly what properties matter to the organism and when two ecosystem states are equivalent this natural definition of ecosystem state in terms of proportional population growth rates has some important consequences for example two ecosystems which have the same abundance of every species and may therefore be viewed as equivalent by an external observer may or may not be equivalent to the organisms involved on the other hand all internal equilibria of a deterministic system are equivalent thus alternative stable states with the same set of taxa present are invisible in evolutionary terms to the organisms involved the definition also suggests some immediate questions first applying this definition across all species in an ecosystem leads to a high dimensional state ecosystem properties visible to an external observer such as diversity are often summarized in a low dimensional way for example using diversity indices jost 2006 can the same be done for the natural measure of ecosystem state second the relationship between the dynamics of an ecosystem including all properties that an external observer could measure and the dynamics of ecosystem states as experienced by organisms may have important consequences for attempts to explain patterns in ecosystem structure borrelli et al 2015 natural selection cannot distinguish between groups of organisms with the same proportional population growth rates as a result there will be variation among ecosystem states visible to an external observer on which natural selection cannot act to what extent does this limit the role of natural selection as an explanation for ecosystem structure in this paper we aim to i develop the ideas outlined above about equivalence of ecosystem states from the point of view of the organisms involved in a more formal way ii clarify the distinction between dynamics on equivalence classes of ecosystems from the point of view of organisms and dynamics as seen by an external observer iii identify classes of ecosystems differing in the relationship between these two kinds of dynamics iv develop measures of ecosystem dissimilarity and scalar measures of ecosystem state based on proportional population growth rates these concepts can be applied either to compare ecosystem states in different locations or ecosystem states at the same location at different times we illustrate the use of summaries of ecosystem state from the point of view of organisms with data from a plankton system we discuss the consequences of these ideas for comparative studies of ecosystems and the mechanisms that may generate regularities at the ecosystem level 2 equivalence from the point of view of organisms definition 1 let ω be an amount of physical space i e an area or volume in two or three dimensional physical space respectively let x x 1 x 2 x n be the abundances e g numbers of individuals if individuals are well defined or cover or biomass otherwise of all the n species present in ω x i ℝ 0 i 1 n let y y 1 y 2 y m be the values of all the physicochemical variables affecting any of these species y i ℝ i 1 m then s ω x y is an ecosystem state definition 1 is not greatly different from standard usage but it is necessary to have a precise definition the specification of ω as an amount of physical space irrespective of location will allow us to make comparisons between different locations with the same set of species present as well as between the same location at different times definition 2 let s be the set of ecosystem states s s in which exactly the same set of n species are present and let α be any function with domain and codomain s then s is an ecosystem and α is an endomap of s lawvere and schanuel 2009 p 15 describing ecosystem dynamics within s again our definition of ecosystem is close to standard usage in what follows we assume for simplicity that dynamics operate in discrete time essentially the same arguments as those below can be made in continuous time the only difference being that there must then be an endomap α t for each real number t satisfying α 0 1 s the identity in s and α t u α t α u i e the composition α t following α u lawvere and schanuel 2009 p 169 note that the definition above does not require us to say anything about what kind of function α is we later develop ideas about the consequences of different classes of endomaps for ecosystem dynamics section 4 and discuss a particular example eq 4 but at this stage the theory remains general let r i s ℝ be a function from the set s of ecosystem states to the real numbers ℝ such that r i s is the contribution of endogenous processes e g births and deaths to the proportional growth rate of the ith species in general we assume that this may depend on both abundances x and physicochemical variables y although we later give special cases in which it depends on only one of these in a finite population r i s is interpreted as the expected value over demographic stochasticity there is no need to consider environmental stochasticity because by definition all the variables that affect r i are specified in the ecosystem state s we do not require that the ecosystem state s is part of a closed system but we do not include immigration and emigration in r i s this is consistent with the view that immigration and emigration should not be considered when determining the suitability of an environment for a species which resolves some of the problems with connecting the definition of a niche to the distribution of a species drake and richards 2017 in what follows for conciseness we sometimes simply refer to proportional population growth rate unless otherwise specified this refers only to the endogenous component of this growth rate to the ith species two ecosystem states s s s are equivalent if and only if r i s r i s i e the contributions of endogenous processes to proportional population growth rate are equal as argued above when this condition is satisfied the two ecosystem states lie in the same level set in niche space for the ith species so that from the point of view of the species nothing happens if we move from one to the other even though the ecosystem states may appear different to an external observer in other words a unit of abundance of the ith species in ecosystem state s would neither benefit nor suffer in evolutionary terms if exchanged with a unit of abundance of the same species from ecosystem state s let i be the relation defined on the set of ecosystem states s by s i s if and only if r i s r i s this is an equivalence relation because it is reflexive symmetric and transitive halmos 1974 p 28 the elements of the quotient set s i the equivalence classes of i in s are the level sets in niche space for species i provided that the abundance of any species having a direct effect on r i is included as a niche axis maguire 1973 definition 3 let r be the function r s ℝ n s r 1 s r n s which maps ecosystem states to n tuples of real numbers representing contributions of endogenous processes to proportional population growth rates of all species because the set of such n tuples is important it is worth giving it a symbol r and a name the growth space of the ecosystem spencer 2015 with the value of the function r s being a point in growth space we henceforth call this a growth state to differentiate this term from the more generally defined ecosystem state let be the relation on the set of ecosystem states s defined by r i e s s means that r s r s again this is reflexive transitive and symmetric so it is an equivalence relation then we say that ecosystem states s s s are equivalent from the point of view of every species if and only if s s in other words two ecosystem states are equivalent if and only if for each species the endogenous component of proportional population growth rate does not differ between them the elements of the quotient set s are the intersections of the quotient sets s 1 s n i e s s i 1 n i in biological terms these are the intersections of a given set of level sets for each species in niche space note that some of these intersections may be empty studying intersections of sets in niche space has been productive in the past for example hutchinson 1957 focused on intersections of the sets r i 0 the niche of a species where it has non negative proportional population growth rate and tilman 1980 focused on intersections of the level sets r i 0 the boundary of the niche in order to study the potential for coexistence however the intersections of other level sets are also biologically important a point we return to in the discussion we do not assume that either the endomap α definition 2 the function describing ecosystem dynamics or the function r from ecosystem states to proportional population growth rates of all species definition 3 has any particular form in general the equations describing ecosystem dynamics are unknown for example the lotka volterra equations can usefully be thought of as a second order taylor polynomial approximation to some more complicated system hutchinson 1978 p 117 but there are few situations in which one would believe that these are the true equations it is possible to constrain the form of the functions r i that describe endogenous contributions to proportional population growth rate based on a few axioms cropp and norbury 2015 although we do not follow this up here it may lead to a deeper understanding of the range of possible dynamics on equivalence classes we also do not assume that specifying the function r from ecosystem states to proportional population growth rates is sufficient to specify the ecosystem s endomap α although endogenous dynamics are important immigration and emigration of organisms and external factors influencing environmental conditions must also be specified in order to know the future state of an ecosystem closed ecosystems have received more theoretical attention but ecosystems with input and output of nutrients and organisms can have qualitatively different dynamics loreau and holt 2004 3 ecosystems as objects in the category of sets with endomaps a category can be thought of as a set of objects a b c and a set of arrows f g h such that 1 each arrow f has some object a as its domain source and some object b as its codomain target 2 there is an identity consisting of an arrow 1 a for each object a with domain and codomain a 3 any pair of arrows f g such that the codomain of f is the domain of g can be composed to form a composite arrow g f from the domain of f to the codomain of g 4 composition is associative i e h g f h g f 5 composition satisfies the unit laws that for arrows f with codomain b and g with domain b 1 b f f and g 1 b g lawvere and schanuel 2009 p 21 for example a set of ecosystem states s with an endomap α describing ecosystem dynamics is an object in the category of sets with endomaps lawvere and schanuel 2009 p 136 an arrow f in this category from a set x with endomap γ to a set y with endomap δ must preserve the structure of the endomap in the sense that it must satisfy 1 f γ δ f intuitively this means that we can either follow dynamics on x and then map the result to y or map to y and then follow the corresponding dynamics of the result on y thus the dynamical structure on x defined by the endomap γ is preserved in the structure on y defined by the endomap δ 4 classes of ecosystem dynamics dynamics on a set of ecosystem states s visible to an external observer induce dynamics in growth space r as experienced by organisms in the ecosystem we want to know whether these dynamics have the same structure in the sense of eq 1 we need to specify an endomap β on r the natural choice is described in appendix a next we construct a function ϕ s s such that s s ϕ s ϕ s then we can show appendix a that dynamics on the set of equivalence classes preserves the structure in ecosystem dynamics if and only if 2 ϕ s ϕ s ϕ α s ϕ α s for all s s s this means simply that the endomap α describing ecosystem dynamics on the set of ecosystem states s must not separate members of equivalence classes it is useful to distinguish three classes of ecosystem dynamics based on whether and how condition 2 is satisfied a condition 2 holds because ϕ α ϕ so r is a map in the category of sets with endomaps some of the possible ways this could occur are i if α 1 s then ϕ α ϕ and condition 2 holds this is the trivial case in which ecosystems never change ii note that ϕ is idempotent i e ϕ ϕ ϕ since ϕ ϕ s ϕ s s ϕ s for any s s hence α ϕ also satisfies condition 2 and is not equal to 1 s provided that at least one equivalence class has more than one member there is no obvious biological example of this case iii if resource levels change over time but in such a way that r the vector of endogenous contributions to proportional population growth rates for each species remains constant as in fig 1 dashed arrow then α 1 s but ϕ α ϕ this could in principle be achieved in a controlled laboratory system but does not appear likely in nature iv finally and most importantly consider an infinite well mixed space ω and a set of species interacting only through resource depletion and production of waste products the proportional growth rate of each species depends on physicochemical variables y but not on abundances x so that for example there is no interference competition or predation and will not in general be zero thus in a closed system we expect abundances x to change over time so α 1 s furthermore because ω is infinite and well mixed y does not change over time so proportional growth rates do not change over time and the abundance of each species grows or declines exponentially thus in this case ecosystem states change while remaining in the same equivalence class and condition 2 is satisfied this malthusian situation is an important starting point for theory analogous to the role of a body with no forces acting on it in physics ginzburg 1986 in the real world a similar situation can be realized in a chemostat in which the ecosystem is open and proportional population growth rates are constant but not necessarily zero while abundances in the system do not change b condition 2 holds even though ϕ α ϕ in other words ecosystem states change equivalence class over time but these dynamics keep members of the same equivalence class together so that the function r describing endogenous contributions to proportional population growth rates is a map in the category of sets with endomaps there are several possible examples i suppose that the function r describing endogenous contributions to proportional population growth rates depends on the ecosystem state s only as a one one function of a single physicochemical variable y and that changes in abundances x do not affect y then each equivalence class of s contains ecosystem states with a single value of y but potentially differing in x changes in y will lead to dynamics among equivalence classes but the members of an equivalence class will stay together in idealized stream or soil ecosystems y could represent detritus and x detritivores with pure donor controlled dynamics pimm 1982 p 136 with change over time caused by variation in input and output of the resource alternatively y could be an environmental variable whose effects dominate all other variables with change over time caused by extrinsic environmental variability ii suppose that proportional population growth rates in a closed system depend only on abundances x through the relative abundances ρ i 1 n x i 1 x and not on physicochemical variables y then all ecosystem states with abundances of the form c ρ for fixed ρ will be in an equivalence class and will be mapped to the same new equivalence class by the function α describing ecosystem dynamics appendix b ecosystems of this kind have purely frequency dependent dynamics implicitly assumed in models based only on relative abundances the term frequency dependence which is well established in the ecological literature means only that dynamics depend on relative abundances arditi and ginzburg 2012 section 6 1 argue that this kind of scaling invariance may be a desirable property frequency dependence is certainly possible e g hutchinson 1978 pp 134 135 and is sometimes likely to be important for example if space is limiting and all the available space is always filled frequency dependence may be the dominant way in which abundances affect proportional population growth rates c in most cases condition 2 will not be satisfied and so r the endogenous contributions to proportional population growth rate will not be a map in the category of sets with endomaps for example consider a closed ecosystem containing a single species of phytoplankton with abundance x whose proportional population growth rate 1 x dx dt depends on the concentrations of nitrogen n and phosphorus p which are used during growth but not recycled this is another case in which endogenous contributions to proportional population growth rates depend only on physicochemical variables y a simple model for such an ecosystem from maguire 1973 is 3 d x d t x r max a n n 2 b p p 2 d n d t c d x d t d p d t d d x d t where r max is the maximum possible proportional population growth rate attained at optimum concentrations n p of nitrogen and phosphorus respectively parameters a and b determine how quickly proportional population growth rate declines as nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations respectively are moved away from the optimum and c d are quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus needed to produce a unit of biomass respectively the space ω is not explicitly defined but s ω x n p is an ecosystem state consider the endomap α describing ecosystem dynamics defined by 4 α s s ω x 0 n 0 p 0 ω x 1 n 1 p 1 where x 0 n 0 p 0 are initial values and x 1 n 1 p 1 are solutions of eq 3 after one unit of time applying this map to some of the ecosystem states in the equivalence class s s r s 1 fig 2 bold black line gives sets of ecosystem states fig 2 black lines each line corresponds to a different value of x 0 which cut contours of proportional population growth rate fig 2 grey lines and thus separate equivalence classes 5 ecosystem dissimilarity and summaries of growth state it is unlikely that two real ecosystem states will ever be exactly equivalent in empirical work it may therefore be useful to measure how far two ecosystem states are from being equivalent this is analogous to the common approach of measuring dissimilarity between ecosystems legendre and legendre 2012 chapter 7 but from the point of view of the organisms involved what properties should be possessed by a measure of how far from equivalence two ecosystem states s 1 s 2 are let d s 1 s 2 be such a measure convention suggests that we should have d s 1 s 2 0 for all s 1 s 2 s it will usually be sensible to require that d s 1 s 2 0 if and only if r s 1 r s 2 i e the two ecosystem states are equivalent there is in general no reason to privilege one ecosystem state over another so it is natural to require that d s 1 s 2 d s 2 s 1 a measure with all these properties is a semimetric legendre and legendre 2012 p 295 there are many measures with these properties of which the most obvious is euclidean distance which also satisfies the triangle inequality and is therefore a metric sutherland 2009 p 39 this last property may not be necessary but is at worst harmless and is often useful we will therefore work with euclidean distance in what follows it may be useful to think of this measure as describing dissimilarity in niche space as well as in growth space given that the growth state r s of an ecosystem the n tuple of proportional population growth rates for all the species it contains at the time is typically high dimensional it is natural to ask whether and how it can be summarized any function of r s is invariant under dynamics within an equivalence class and might therefore be considered as a summary of growth state in contrast anything which is not a function of r s will separate measures of the same equivalence class and is therefore not a summary of growth state as a first example of something that is a valid summary of growth state proportional population growth rates are likely to be unknown for most species in an ecosystem in practice it will be necessary to work with the m tuple of proportional population growth rates that are known where m n since this is a function of r s it is a summary of growth state it will often be the case that proportional population growth rates can be calculated for higher taxa or guilds but not for individual species strictly speaking such aggregation is only valid if the species being aggregated have identical proportional population growth rates at all times this is unlikely to be exactly true but may often be approximately true ordination legendre and legendre 2012 chapter 9 can be done from the point of view of organisms rather than that of an external observer given dissimilarities in growth space an ordination based on points in growth space rather than in abundance space is a valid summary of growth state because it is a function of r s alone and may be a useful low dimensional approximation of growth state scalar summaries are also of interest under the view that proportional population growth rates represent the state of an ecosystem scalar summaries of growth state will correspond to what are conventionally viewed as scalar summaries of change however many commonly used measures of rate of succession such as euclidean distances bray curtis distances and chi square distances among relative abundances reviewed in spencer 2015 appendix b are not measures of growth state because they can take more than one value for the same value of r s and therefore split up equivalence classes in contrast the living planet index loh et al 2005 is a scalar summary of growth state because it depends only on r s two closely related measures of growth state are size change and shape change spencer 2015 yuan et al 2016 size change is the mean of the elements of r s and shows whether a typical taxon or guild is increasing or decreasing in abundance shape change is the sample standard deviation of the elements of r s and shows the extent to which different taxa or guilds are changing in abundance in different ways the rate of competitive exclusion for a pair of taxa or guilds i j is defined as r i s r j s pásztor et al 2016 p 122 it is easy to show that the square of shape change is proportional to the expected squared rate of competitive exclusion over all pairs of distinct taxa or guilds spencer 2015 appendix c and is therefore a property of a typical pair 6 example lake constance plankton in this section we summarize the seasonal patterns of growth state for the plankton community in lake constance the theoretical concept of equivalent ecosystem states is applied to a real world setting using empirical data on population growth rates from one particular ecosystem changing its state throughout time boit and gaedke 2014 describe the typical seasonal cycle of the plankton community in lake constance using splines fitted to biomass of 20 planktonic guilds over a standardized year averaged from 1987 to 1996 plankton samples were taken weekly during the growing seasons apr nov and approximately bi weekly during the winter months rather than investigating the raw data in each year we work here with a statistical model to cancel out most of the inter annual variability caused by stochastic weather events averaging over several years extracts the overarching general patterns from the empirical data set which then fulfils three requirements 1 it contains the same set of species over time 2 it consists of long term frequent observations spanning multiple generations 3 it reveals the internally driven dynamics of the food web the last point is important because in lake constance predator prey interactions induce annually repeating changes in population abundances of several orders of magnitudes over a few weeks during the growing season boit and gaedke 2014 this makes lake constance an especially well suited case study for investigating growth states largely independent from external abiotic forcing data proportional population growth rates r i s in days 1 were estimated as differences in spline interpolated natural log biomass between successive days fig 3 hence the spline interpolation represents hypothetical daily observations during a typical year in lake constance daily growth rates represent the relevant time scale for investigating plankton dynamics in lake constance as the fastest eucaryotic organisms unicellular algae reproduce daily by division sommer 1985 which sets the pace of life for their multicellular predators e g daphnids with a generation time of about 1 week the first three principal components of the proportional population growth rates r s describe 78 of the variation in the seasonal cycle fig 4 the ordination suggests that the ecosystem in may june and july is relatively distinct from the rest of the year when proportional population growth rates are much closer to zero may and june are the late spring and clear water phases when the most extreme positive and negative proportional population growth rates occur fig 3 shaded areas while the ecosystem undergoes a major reorganization from an early resource driven to a more mature resource limited successional state boit and gaedke 2014 in particular in the late spring phase may characterized by algal dominance boit and gaedke 2014 most of the algal guilds alg2 alg3 alg4 alg5 fig 3b c d e autotrophic picoplankton app fig 3f and medium and large ciliates cil3 cil4 cil5 fig 3k l m have generally negative proportional population growth rates while single celled algae alg1 fig 3a rotifers asp rot1 rot2 rot3 fig 3g r s t cladocerans and calanoid copepods dap fig 3o and the cladocerans leptodora and bythotrephes lep fig 3q have generally positive proportional population growth rates in the clear water phase june characterized by temporary dominance of daphnids and a temporary inversion of the biomass pyramid boit and gaedke 2014 small coccal algae alg5 fig 3e autotrophic picoplankton app fig 3f and large carnivorous rotifers asp fig 3g have generally negative proportional population growth rates while most of the algae alg2 alg3 alg4 fig 3b c d ciliates cil1 cil2 cil3 cil5 fig 3i j k m and the cladocerans leptodora and bythotrephes lep fig 3q have generally positive proportional population growth rates in lake constance there are two annual peaks in size change corresponding roughly to the spring and summer blooms separated by a local minimum at the boundary between the late spring and clear water phases fig 5 a white line between shaded regions this local minimum occurs because at the start of the clear water phase most guilds have negative proportional population growth rates fig 3 due to dominance of daphnids boit and gaedke 2014 fig 1b in contrast shape change is highest in the late spring and clear water phases fig 5b shaded regions because although the proportional population growth rates are low for many guilds they vary substantially among guilds fig 3 thus shape change behaves very differently from lewis s measure of rate of succession lewis 1978 which has a deep local minimum between the spring and autumn blooms boit and gaedke 2014 fig 4b lewis s measure which is widely used by plankton ecologists is not a function of r s alone spencer 2015 appendix b and therefore is not a measure of growth state in the sense used here although scalar summaries are appealing in their simplicity two ecosystems with the same value of one or more of these functions may not be equivalent from the point of view of any species for example both size change and shape change in lake constance differ by less than 5 10 4 days 1 between days 37 and 210 fig 5 dashed lines and yet the ordination makes it clear that the growth state of the ecosystem is very different on these days fig 4 the open circles are far apart in fact 11 out of 20 guilds have proportional population growth rates with different signs between these days and the pearson correlation between proportional population growth rates on these dates is 0 33 to understand the differences in more detail it is necessary to look at the proportional population growth rates for each guild fig 6 the mean and standard deviation are almost identical on both days fig 6 filled black circles and vertical lines and the ranges are similar fig 6 symbols other than filled black circles nevertheless the identities of the guilds with proportional population growth rates far from zero differ considerably between the two days and no guild has exactly the same proportional population growth rate on both days fig 6 none of the coloured lines is horizontal the guild with the lowest proportional population growth rate on day 37 is alg3 filamentous blue and green algae which has the highest proportional population growth rate on day 210 the lep guild the cladocerans leptodora and bythotrephes has the highest proportional population growth rate on day 37 but a proportional population growth rate slightly below the mean fig 6 right hand filled circle on day 210 the cil1 guild small ciliates has the lowest proportional population growth rate on day 210 but a rate above the mean fig 6 left hand filled circle on day 37 in summary even a valid scalar summary of the growth state of an ecosystem such as size change or shape change may not give a good picture of the state of the ecosystem as experienced by any particular species 7 discussion we argued above that two ecosystem states are equivalent if and only if for each species the proportional population growth rate does not differ between the states much of community and ecosystem ecology is devoted to searching for patterns in variables such as species abundances or relative abundances measures of diversity and measures of complexity however we showed that except in special circumstances the dynamics of an ecosystem as experienced by the organisms in it in terms of proportional population growth rates will not be the same as the dynamics seen by an external observer who focuses on some other property a consequence of our argument is that many of the traditional activities of community and ecosystem ecology will not lead to a deeper understanding of how organisms experience ecosystems instead it may be more productive to search for patterns in proportional population growth rates this change in approach comes with new challenges such as finding appropriate ways to understand patterns in large numbers of proportional population growth rates it also opens up new perspectives on important existing topics such as alternative stable states the development of ecosystems over time and the processes generating regularities in ecosystems a natural consequence of the arguments developed here is that proportional population growth rates should occupy a more central position in community and ecosystem ecology just as they are currently at the heart of population ecology pásztor et al 2016 p 5 one challenge is that estimating proportional population growth rates is more difficult than estimating abundances in order to estimate proportional population growth rates abundance estimates must be obtained at a minimum of two time points however this difficulty is not insurmountable furthermore we propose to do more than just replace snapshots of abundance with monitoring changes over time by using proportional population growth rates as measures of ecosystem state properties other than abundances for example rates of nutrient cycling are implicitly considered to the extent that they are important to organisms through their effects on proportional population growth rates another challenge is that communities and ecosystems usually contain large numbers of species and it can be difficult to understand and summarize the resulting high dimensional patterns in proportional population growth rates we showed that an ordination based on principal components of proportional population growth rates fig 4 was able to describe most of the variation in growth state in lake constance we also showed in section 5 that it was possible to construct valid scalar summaries of the growth state of lake constance size change and shape change fig 5 however two dates with almost identical size change and shape change in fact had very different growth states because the identities of the guilds with proportional population growth rates far from zero were different fig 6 the dynamics of the two summary indices reveal the pattern of community reorganization during the clear water phase at one glance complementing the population level perspective overall the example from lake constance suggests that more thought is needed about the ecological meaning of summaries of growth state for example size change and shape change tell us about properties of typical taxa or guilds and of typical pairs of taxa or guilds respectively however they do not tell us about properties of particular taxa or guilds the same is true of the closely related living planet index loh et al 2005 an important statistic in global conservation biology the change from particular to aggregate properties demands a justification which is currently lacking in the same way that studying biodiversity per se an aggregate property rather than the particular species in an ecosystem each contributing to the aggregate property demands a justification maier 2012 pp 75 76 our approach can be used to generalize the idea of alternative stable states to that of alternative equivalent states identifying alternative stable states is a challenging problem petraitis 2013 however if these states contain the same set of species they are all equivalent to the organisms involved their distinctive feature is that the equivalence class in which all species have zero proportional population growth rate consists of more than one disjoint subset more generally when proportional population growth rates depend on multiple interacting resources each with a finite optimum value tilman 1980 it is easy to arrange equivalence classes for two or more species consisting of disjoint subsets in which proportional population growth rates are not all zero we call these alternative equivalent states such states may look very different in terms of abundances and physicochemical variables since it is easy to construct these geometrically we suggest that they will be common in nature a key theme in ecosystem ecology has been to identify regularities in ecosystem development e g odum 1969 a visual representation of patterns in growth space for a particular ecosystem e g fig 4 is purely exploratory nevertheless there is the potential to identify general patterns of dynamics in growth space based on the axiomatic approach to population dynamics advocated by lotka 1956 pp 57 66 hutchinson 1978 pp 1 5 and cropp and norbury 2012 2015 among others however the structural difference between dynamics of equivalence classes of ecosystem states and the dynamics of ecosystems has an important bearing on the kinds of regularities that a given mechanism can generate for example an influential if controversial idea in ecosystem ecology is that ecosystems are shaped by natural selection on the ability to capture energy lotka 1922 lotka s argument relies on the assumption that increased energy capture increases proportional population growth rate and can therefore be subject to natural selection lotka proposed that such selection on energy capture leads to maximization of biomass and energy flow at the ecosystem level however unpredictable external events may generate variation within equivalence classes which is invisible to natural selection thus natural selection cannot lead to regularities by eliminating such variation over time we argued above that equivalence classes may be disjoint containing ecosystems with quite different physicochemical properties if there are regularities at the ecosystem level either they must be at the level of equivalence classes or they must be generated by some mechanism other than natural selection stability selection is one such mechanism borrelli et al 2015 stability selection acts without seeing the local environment damuth and ginzburg 2019 or in other words it does not act via proportional population growth rates it is therefore unlinked from the equivalence classes of an ecosystem and may have the potential to generate regularities even within equivalence classes in conclusion we distinguish between the view of ecosystems taken by an external observer with the ability to study whatever they like and an organism in an ecosystem for whom proportional population growth rates are the only relevant aspect of ecosystem state this distinction leads to major differences in the approach that should be taken to comparative studies of ecosystems ecologists should focus on patterns in proportional population growth rates rather than patterns in other properties of ecosystems scalar summaries of these patterns such as size change and shape change are already available but can sometimes conceal important differences among ecosystem states the idea of alternative stable states can be generalized to equivalent ecosystem states with very different physicochemical properties finally since natural selection acts only on proportional population growth rates regularities in other aspects of ecosystem structure may not be explicable by natural

describes these dynamics a natural choice for β is a map taking r s to r α s the outcome of dynamics on ecosystems mapped to r if such a map exists thus suppose that z r s to get from z r s to β z r α s we have to first go back to s then apply α and finally go from the result of this to r the function r is not in general one one so it will not in general have a retraction r that undoes it in the sense that r r 1 s lawvere and schanuel 2009 p 53 however we can construct the function r r s s z s where s is an arbitrary representative of the set s s r s z then if the function r α r exists it is the natural choice for β on r s for elements of r outside the image set of s under r we can define β in an arbitrary way say β 1 r it is clear that we will not always be able to construct β in this way in fact if we cannot then there is no endomap on r such that r is a structure preserving map from s to r theorem 1 the map r s r can be a structure preserving map if and only if the endomap α on s satisfies the condition that a 1 s s α s α s s s s proof first we show that if condition a 1 holds then the endomap β on r is structure preserving if the condition holds then by the definition of s s r α s r α s then a 2 β r r z r α s if z r s z otherwise is a valid endomap on r because it has domain and codomain r and associates a single element of its codomain with each element of its domain it also satisfies r α β r and is therefore structure preserving theorem 1 makes intuitive sense condition a 1 says that for dynamics on the set of equivalence classes to preserve the structure in ecosystem dynamics the ecosystem dynamics must not separate equivalence classes for example in fig a 1 a the structure of α can be preserved by r for the natural choice of the endomap β on r described above because α keeps members of equivalence classes together in contrast in fig a 1b the structure of α cannot be preserved by r because s and s are in the same equivalence class but are mapped by α to different equivalence classes condition a 1 is somewhat analogous to the condition under which a function of a markov chain will be markovian burke and rosenblatt 1958 to find examples of endomaps α satisfying condition a 1 we first construct a function ϕ s s such that s s ϕ s ϕ s lemma 1 let ϕ be the function ϕ s s s s such that s s i e s is any fixed representative of the equivalence class of s on s then s s ϕ s ϕ s proof if s s then ϕ s ϕ s s conversely if s s then ϕ s s but ϕ s s since an equivalence relation on s partitions s halmos 1974 p 28 so that s cannot be equivalent to both s and s we can now rewrite condition a 1 as a 3 ϕ s ϕ s ϕ α s ϕ α s s s s this is simply an alternative way of saying that the endomap α on s must not separate members of equivalence classes appendix b frequency dependent dynamics suppose that proportional population growth rates in a closed system depend only on x through the relative abundances ρ i 1 n x i 1 x let ψ be a function from s n 1 ℝ 0 where the simplex s n 1 contains the relative abundances and ℝ 0 contains a time difference to ℝ n then for some time interval δt ecosystem dynamics α are given by α s s ω x y ω x ψ ρ δ t y where denotes the elementwise hadamard product hence for any given set of relative abundances ρ all ecosystems with abundances of the form c ρ for some positive number c map to ecosystems with abundances of the form c x ψ ρ δt also for each species i r i s lim δ t 0 ψ i ρ δ t 1 δ t which depends on x only through ρ thus all ecosystems with abundances of the form c ρ for fixed ρ will be in an equivalence class and will be mapped to the same new equivalence class by α 
25107,measuring dis similarity between ecosystem states is a key theme in ecology much of community and ecosystem ecology is devoted to searching for patterns in ecosystem similarity from an external observer s viewpoint using variables such as species abundances measures of diversity and complexity however from the point of view of organisms in the ecosystem proportional population growth rates are the only relevant aspect of ecosystem state because natural selection acts on groups of organisms with different proportional population growth rates we therefore argue that two ecosystem states are equivalent if and only if for each species they contain the proportional population growth rate does not differ between the states based on this result we develop species level and aggregated summary measures of ecosystem state and discuss their ecological meaning we illustrate our approach using a long term dataset on the plankton community from the central european lake constance we show that the first three principal components of proportional population growth rates describe most of the variation in ecosystem state in lake constance we strongly recommend using proportional population growth rates and the derived equivalence classes for comparative ecosystem studies this opens up new perspectives on important existing topics such as alternative stable ecosystem states community assembly and the processes generating regularities in ecosystems keywords hutchinson niche ecosystem dynamics ecosystem dissimilarity proportional population growth rate per capita growth rate 1 introduction in abstract terms ecosystem ecology is about identifying deep similarities between superficially different ecosystems for example practical problems such as developing ecological indicators niemi and mcdonald 2004 rely on having an appropriate concept of the properties of ecosystems which make them similar or dissimilar widely used properties include abundances ginzburg 1983 p 7 relative abundances legendre and legendre 2012 p 328 diversity jost 2006 complexity of energy flow pathways ulanowicz 1986 and aspects of ecosystem functioning such as productivity and material cycling loreau 2010 chapters 3 and 6 however to an external observer of the ecosystem there does not appear to be any objective way to determine which of these many properties are relevant or how much weight should be given to each this is of practical importance because multiple properties of an ecosystem may change in different ways without an objective way to select and weight these properties different external observers for example government bodies with different priorities may disagree on whether the integrity of an ecosystem has improved or deteriorated between two points in time andreasen et al 2001 in contrast for an organism in an ecosystem the properties that matter and how much weight should be given to each property are determined entirely by the structure of the hutchinson niche an understanding of such structure is therefore essential to the ideas that follow in order to see this we first define proportional population growth rate to mean the rate of change of abundance per unit of abundance for example per capita population growth rate when abundance is measured in individuals or mass specific population growth rate when measured as biomass we require that proportional population growth rate is measurement invariant i e does not depend on the way in which abundance is measured cropp and norbury 2012 hutchinson 1957 defined the niche of an organism as the set of states of the environment permitting a species to persist indefinitely later work makes it clear that by persist indefinitely it was meant that the proportional population growth rate for the species was non negative hutchinson 1978 p 194 thus the dependence of proportional population growth rate on environment is an essential concept in the definition of the hutchinson niche the initial view of niche space was essentially static with a point in niche space representing the fixed values of usually non living resources in an ecosystem maguire 1973 introduced both structure and dynamics into niche space structure was provided by level sets contours if niche space is two dimensional of equal proportional population growth rate and dynamics by movement of ecosystems through niche space driven either by external changes or as a consequence of population growth maguire explicitly stated that this view of niche space allows us to examine the total environment of a species a population or an individual through its biological eyes in other words as an organism within the ecosystem would see it rather than as an external observer of course organisms do not see population growth rate so that the biological eyes of a species must be interpreted as the outcome of the process relating population growth rate to environment exponential growth of a population occurs when nothing happens in the environment ginzburg 1986 in other words exponential growth will occur if and only if the environmental influences on a population do not change turchin 2003 chapter 2 note that in general other populations and the focal population in cases of interference competition are included in the environment this law of exponential growth is a basic principle of population dynamics in a universe without spontaneous generation turchin 2003 p 24 and can be derived using a simple taylor polynomial argument hutchinson 1978 pp 1 3 however it is worth thinking about what the absence of change in environmental influences means with the aid of three cases i it is obvious that if there has been no change in any aspect of the environment then environmental influences have not changed and exponential growth will occur ii if an ecosystem moves through niche space from one level set to another maguire 1973 tilman 1980 fig 1 solid arrow environmental influences are changing proportional population growth rate is changing and population growth is not exponential iii if an ecosystem moves through niche space but remains within a level set fig 1 dashed arrow then although the environment is changing environmental influences on the population do not change proportional population growth rate does not change and population growth is exponential the first and third cases are unlikely to occur in nature but are important conceptually in particular in the third case nothing happens from the point of view of the organism even though to an external observer something is happening in general two ecosystem states which are superficially different can be equivalent from the point of view of a species if they are in the same level set in niche space and therefore lead to the same proportional population growth rate it is necessary to know the structure of the hutchinson niche in order to distinguish between the second and third cases thus the most important aspect of this view of the hutchinson niche is that the map from environment to proportional population growth rates tells us exactly what properties matter to the organism and when two ecosystem states are equivalent this natural definition of ecosystem state in terms of proportional population growth rates has some important consequences for example two ecosystems which have the same abundance of every species and may therefore be viewed as equivalent by an external observer may or may not be equivalent to the organisms involved on the other hand all internal equilibria of a deterministic system are equivalent thus alternative stable states with the same set of taxa present are invisible in evolutionary terms to the organisms involved the definition also suggests some immediate questions first applying this definition across all species in an ecosystem leads to a high dimensional state ecosystem properties visible to an external observer such as diversity are often summarized in a low dimensional way for example using diversity indices jost 2006 can the same be done for the natural measure of ecosystem state second the relationship between the dynamics of an ecosystem including all properties that an external observer could measure and the dynamics of ecosystem states as experienced by organisms may have important consequences for attempts to explain patterns in ecosystem structure borrelli et al 2015 natural selection cannot distinguish between groups of organisms with the same proportional population growth rates as a result there will be variation among ecosystem states visible to an external observer on which natural selection cannot act to what extent does this limit the role of natural selection as an explanation for ecosystem structure in this paper we aim to i develop the ideas outlined above about equivalence of ecosystem states from the point of view of the organisms involved in a more formal way ii clarify the distinction between dynamics on equivalence classes of ecosystems from the point of view of organisms and dynamics as seen by an external observer iii identify classes of ecosystems differing in the relationship between these two kinds of dynamics iv develop measures of ecosystem dissimilarity and scalar measures of ecosystem state based on proportional population growth rates these concepts can be applied either to compare ecosystem states in different locations or ecosystem states at the same location at different times we illustrate the use of summaries of ecosystem state from the point of view of organisms with data from a plankton system we discuss the consequences of these ideas for comparative studies of ecosystems and the mechanisms that may generate regularities at the ecosystem level 2 equivalence from the point of view of organisms definition 1 let ω be an amount of physical space i e an area or volume in two or three dimensional physical space respectively let x x 1 x 2 x n be the abundances e g numbers of individuals if individuals are well defined or cover or biomass otherwise of all the n species present in ω x i ℝ 0 i 1 n let y y 1 y 2 y m be the values of all the physicochemical variables affecting any of these species y i ℝ i 1 m then s ω x y is an ecosystem state definition 1 is not greatly different from standard usage but it is necessary to have a precise definition the specification of ω as an amount of physical space irrespective of location will allow us to make comparisons between different locations with the same set of species present as well as between the same location at different times definition 2 let s be the set of ecosystem states s s in which exactly the same set of n species are present and let α be any function with domain and codomain s then s is an ecosystem and α is an endomap of s lawvere and schanuel 2009 p 15 describing ecosystem dynamics within s again our definition of ecosystem is close to standard usage in what follows we assume for simplicity that dynamics operate in discrete time essentially the same arguments as those below can be made in continuous time the only difference being that there must then be an endomap α t for each real number t satisfying α 0 1 s the identity in s and α t u α t α u i e the composition α t following α u lawvere and schanuel 2009 p 169 note that the definition above does not require us to say anything about what kind of function α is we later develop ideas about the consequences of different classes of endomaps for ecosystem dynamics section 4 and discuss a particular example eq 4 but at this stage the theory remains general let r i s ℝ be a function from the set s of ecosystem states to the real numbers ℝ such that r i s is the contribution of endogenous processes e g births and deaths to the proportional growth rate of the ith species in general we assume that this may depend on both abundances x and physicochemical variables y although we later give special cases in which it depends on only one of these in a finite population r i s is interpreted as the expected value over demographic stochasticity there is no need to consider environmental stochasticity because by definition all the variables that affect r i are specified in the ecosystem state s we do not require that the ecosystem state s is part of a closed system but we do not include immigration and emigration in r i s this is consistent with the view that immigration and emigration should not be considered when determining the suitability of an environment for a species which resolves some of the problems with connecting the definition of a niche to the distribution of a species drake and richards 2017 in what follows for conciseness we sometimes simply refer to proportional population growth rate unless otherwise specified this refers only to the endogenous component of this growth rate to the ith species two ecosystem states s s s are equivalent if and only if r i s r i s i e the contributions of endogenous processes to proportional population growth rate are equal as argued above when this condition is satisfied the two ecosystem states lie in the same level set in niche space for the ith species so that from the point of view of the species nothing happens if we move from one to the other even though the ecosystem states may appear different to an external observer in other words a unit of abundance of the ith species in ecosystem state s would neither benefit nor suffer in evolutionary terms if exchanged with a unit of abundance of the same species from ecosystem state s let i be the relation defined on the set of ecosystem states s by s i s if and only if r i s r i s this is an equivalence relation because it is reflexive symmetric and transitive halmos 1974 p 28 the elements of the quotient set s i the equivalence classes of i in s are the level sets in niche space for species i provided that the abundance of any species having a direct effect on r i is included as a niche axis maguire 1973 definition 3 let r be the function r s ℝ n s r 1 s r n s which maps ecosystem states to n tuples of real numbers representing contributions of endogenous processes to proportional population growth rates of all species because the set of such n tuples is important it is worth giving it a symbol r and a name the growth space of the ecosystem spencer 2015 with the value of the function r s being a point in growth space we henceforth call this a growth state to differentiate this term from the more generally defined ecosystem state let be the relation on the set of ecosystem states s defined by r i e s s means that r s r s again this is reflexive transitive and symmetric so it is an equivalence relation then we say that ecosystem states s s s are equivalent from the point of view of every species if and only if s s in other words two ecosystem states are equivalent if and only if for each species the endogenous component of proportional population growth rate does not differ between them the elements of the quotient set s are the intersections of the quotient sets s 1 s n i e s s i 1 n i in biological terms these are the intersections of a given set of level sets for each species in niche space note that some of these intersections may be empty studying intersections of sets in niche space has been productive in the past for example hutchinson 1957 focused on intersections of the sets r i 0 the niche of a species where it has non negative proportional population growth rate and tilman 1980 focused on intersections of the level sets r i 0 the boundary of the niche in order to study the potential for coexistence however the intersections of other level sets are also biologically important a point we return to in the discussion we do not assume that either the endomap α definition 2 the function describing ecosystem dynamics or the function r from ecosystem states to proportional population growth rates of all species definition 3 has any particular form in general the equations describing ecosystem dynamics are unknown for example the lotka volterra equations can usefully be thought of as a second order taylor polynomial approximation to some more complicated system hutchinson 1978 p 117 but there are few situations in which one would believe that these are the true equations it is possible to constrain the form of the functions r i that describe endogenous contributions to proportional population growth rate based on a few axioms cropp and norbury 2015 although we do not follow this up here it may lead to a deeper understanding of the range of possible dynamics on equivalence classes we also do not assume that specifying the function r from ecosystem states to proportional population growth rates is sufficient to specify the ecosystem s endomap α although endogenous dynamics are important immigration and emigration of organisms and external factors influencing environmental conditions must also be specified in order to know the future state of an ecosystem closed ecosystems have received more theoretical attention but ecosystems with input and output of nutrients and organisms can have qualitatively different dynamics loreau and holt 2004 3 ecosystems as objects in the category of sets with endomaps a category can be thought of as a set of objects a b c and a set of arrows f g h such that 1 each arrow f has some object a as its domain source and some object b as its codomain target 2 there is an identity consisting of an arrow 1 a for each object a with domain and codomain a 3 any pair of arrows f g such that the codomain of f is the domain of g can be composed to form a composite arrow g f from the domain of f to the codomain of g 4 composition is associative i e h g f h g f 5 composition satisfies the unit laws that for arrows f with codomain b and g with domain b 1 b f f and g 1 b g lawvere and schanuel 2009 p 21 for example a set of ecosystem states s with an endomap α describing ecosystem dynamics is an object in the category of sets with endomaps lawvere and schanuel 2009 p 136 an arrow f in this category from a set x with endomap γ to a set y with endomap δ must preserve the structure of the endomap in the sense that it must satisfy 1 f γ δ f intuitively this means that we can either follow dynamics on x and then map the result to y or map to y and then follow the corresponding dynamics of the result on y thus the dynamical structure on x defined by the endomap γ is preserved in the structure on y defined by the endomap δ 4 classes of ecosystem dynamics dynamics on a set of ecosystem states s visible to an external observer induce dynamics in growth space r as experienced by organisms in the ecosystem we want to know whether these dynamics have the same structure in the sense of eq 1 we need to specify an endomap β on r the natural choice is described in appendix a next we construct a function ϕ s s such that s s ϕ s ϕ s then we can show appendix a that dynamics on the set of equivalence classes preserves the structure in ecosystem dynamics if and only if 2 ϕ s ϕ s ϕ α s ϕ α s for all s s s this means simply that the endomap α describing ecosystem dynamics on the set of ecosystem states s must not separate members of equivalence classes it is useful to distinguish three classes of ecosystem dynamics based on whether and how condition 2 is satisfied a condition 2 holds because ϕ α ϕ so r is a map in the category of sets with endomaps some of the possible ways this could occur are i if α 1 s then ϕ α ϕ and condition 2 holds this is the trivial case in which ecosystems never change ii note that ϕ is idempotent i e ϕ ϕ ϕ since ϕ ϕ s ϕ s s ϕ s for any s s hence α ϕ also satisfies condition 2 and is not equal to 1 s provided that at least one equivalence class has more than one member there is no obvious biological example of this case iii if resource levels change over time but in such a way that r the vector of endogenous contributions to proportional population growth rates for each species remains constant as in fig 1 dashed arrow then α 1 s but ϕ α ϕ this could in principle be achieved in a controlled laboratory system but does not appear likely in nature iv finally and most importantly consider an infinite well mixed space ω and a set of species interacting only through resource depletion and production of waste products the proportional growth rate of each species depends on physicochemical variables y but not on abundances x so that for example there is no interference competition or predation and will not in general be zero thus in a closed system we expect abundances x to change over time so α 1 s furthermore because ω is infinite and well mixed y does not change over time so proportional growth rates do not change over time and the abundance of each species grows or declines exponentially thus in this case ecosystem states change while remaining in the same equivalence class and condition 2 is satisfied this malthusian situation is an important starting point for theory analogous to the role of a body with no forces acting on it in physics ginzburg 1986 in the real world a similar situation can be realized in a chemostat in which the ecosystem is open and proportional population growth rates are constant but not necessarily zero while abundances in the system do not change b condition 2 holds even though ϕ α ϕ in other words ecosystem states change equivalence class over time but these dynamics keep members of the same equivalence class together so that the function r describing endogenous contributions to proportional population growth rates is a map in the category of sets with endomaps there are several possible examples i suppose that the function r describing endogenous contributions to proportional population growth rates depends on the ecosystem state s only as a one one function of a single physicochemical variable y and that changes in abundances x do not affect y then each equivalence class of s contains ecosystem states with a single value of y but potentially differing in x changes in y will lead to dynamics among equivalence classes but the members of an equivalence class will stay together in idealized stream or soil ecosystems y could represent detritus and x detritivores with pure donor controlled dynamics pimm 1982 p 136 with change over time caused by variation in input and output of the resource alternatively y could be an environmental variable whose effects dominate all other variables with change over time caused by extrinsic environmental variability ii suppose that proportional population growth rates in a closed system depend only on abundances x through the relative abundances ρ i 1 n x i 1 x and not on physicochemical variables y then all ecosystem states with abundances of the form c ρ for fixed ρ will be in an equivalence class and will be mapped to the same new equivalence class by the function α describing ecosystem dynamics appendix b ecosystems of this kind have purely frequency dependent dynamics implicitly assumed in models based only on relative abundances the term frequency dependence which is well established in the ecological literature means only that dynamics depend on relative abundances arditi and ginzburg 2012 section 6 1 argue that this kind of scaling invariance may be a desirable property frequency dependence is certainly possible e g hutchinson 1978 pp 134 135 and is sometimes likely to be important for example if space is limiting and all the available space is always filled frequency dependence may be the dominant way in which abundances affect proportional population growth rates c in most cases condition 2 will not be satisfied and so r the endogenous contributions to proportional population growth rate will not be a map in the category of sets with endomaps for example consider a closed ecosystem containing a single species of phytoplankton with abundance x whose proportional population growth rate 1 x dx dt depends on the concentrations of nitrogen n and phosphorus p which are used during growth but not recycled this is another case in which endogenous contributions to proportional population growth rates depend only on physicochemical variables y a simple model for such an ecosystem from maguire 1973 is 3 d x d t x r max a n n 2 b p p 2 d n d t c d x d t d p d t d d x d t where r max is the maximum possible proportional population growth rate attained at optimum concentrations n p of nitrogen and phosphorus respectively parameters a and b determine how quickly proportional population growth rate declines as nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations respectively are moved away from the optimum and c d are quantities of nitrogen and phosphorus needed to produce a unit of biomass respectively the space ω is not explicitly defined but s ω x n p is an ecosystem state consider the endomap α describing ecosystem dynamics defined by 4 α s s ω x 0 n 0 p 0 ω x 1 n 1 p 1 where x 0 n 0 p 0 are initial values and x 1 n 1 p 1 are solutions of eq 3 after one unit of time applying this map to some of the ecosystem states in the equivalence class s s r s 1 fig 2 bold black line gives sets of ecosystem states fig 2 black lines each line corresponds to a different value of x 0 which cut contours of proportional population growth rate fig 2 grey lines and thus separate equivalence classes 5 ecosystem dissimilarity and summaries of growth state it is unlikely that two real ecosystem states will ever be exactly equivalent in empirical work it may therefore be useful to measure how far two ecosystem states are from being equivalent this is analogous to the common approach of measuring dissimilarity between ecosystems legendre and legendre 2012 chapter 7 but from the point of view of the organisms involved what properties should be possessed by a measure of how far from equivalence two ecosystem states s 1 s 2 are let d s 1 s 2 be such a measure convention suggests that we should have d s 1 s 2 0 for all s 1 s 2 s it will usually be sensible to require that d s 1 s 2 0 if and only if r s 1 r s 2 i e the two ecosystem states are equivalent there is in general no reason to privilege one ecosystem state over another so it is natural to require that d s 1 s 2 d s 2 s 1 a measure with all these properties is a semimetric legendre and legendre 2012 p 295 there are many measures with these properties of which the most obvious is euclidean distance which also satisfies the triangle inequality and is therefore a metric sutherland 2009 p 39 this last property may not be necessary but is at worst harmless and is often useful we will therefore work with euclidean distance in what follows it may be useful to think of this measure as describing dissimilarity in niche space as well as in growth space given that the growth state r s of an ecosystem the n tuple of proportional population growth rates for all the species it contains at the time is typically high dimensional it is natural to ask whether and how it can be summarized any function of r s is invariant under dynamics within an equivalence class and might therefore be considered as a summary of growth state in contrast anything which is not a function of r s will separate measures of the same equivalence class and is therefore not a summary of growth state as a first example of something that is a valid summary of growth state proportional population growth rates are likely to be unknown for most species in an ecosystem in practice it will be necessary to work with the m tuple of proportional population growth rates that are known where m n since this is a function of r s it is a summary of growth state it will often be the case that proportional population growth rates can be calculated for higher taxa or guilds but not for individual species strictly speaking such aggregation is only valid if the species being aggregated have identical proportional population growth rates at all times this is unlikely to be exactly true but may often be approximately true ordination legendre and legendre 2012 chapter 9 can be done from the point of view of organisms rather than that of an external observer given dissimilarities in growth space an ordination based on points in growth space rather than in abundance space is a valid summary of growth state because it is a function of r s alone and may be a useful low dimensional approximation of growth state scalar summaries are also of interest under the view that proportional population growth rates represent the state of an ecosystem scalar summaries of growth state will correspond to what are conventionally viewed as scalar summaries of change however many commonly used measures of rate of succession such as euclidean distances bray curtis distances and chi square distances among relative abundances reviewed in spencer 2015 appendix b are not measures of growth state because they can take more than one value for the same value of r s and therefore split up equivalence classes in contrast the living planet index loh et al 2005 is a scalar summary of growth state because it depends only on r s two closely related measures of growth state are size change and shape change spencer 2015 yuan et al 2016 size change is the mean of the elements of r s and shows whether a typical taxon or guild is increasing or decreasing in abundance shape change is the sample standard deviation of the elements of r s and shows the extent to which different taxa or guilds are changing in abundance in different ways the rate of competitive exclusion for a pair of taxa or guilds i j is defined as r i s r j s pásztor et al 2016 p 122 it is easy to show that the square of shape change is proportional to the expected squared rate of competitive exclusion over all pairs of distinct taxa or guilds spencer 2015 appendix c and is therefore a property of a typical pair 6 example lake constance plankton in this section we summarize the seasonal patterns of growth state for the plankton community in lake constance the theoretical concept of equivalent ecosystem states is applied to a real world setting using empirical data on population growth rates from one particular ecosystem changing its state throughout time boit and gaedke 2014 describe the typical seasonal cycle of the plankton community in lake constance using splines fitted to biomass of 20 planktonic guilds over a standardized year averaged from 1987 to 1996 plankton samples were taken weekly during the growing seasons apr nov and approximately bi weekly during the winter months rather than investigating the raw data in each year we work here with a statistical model to cancel out most of the inter annual variability caused by stochastic weather events averaging over several years extracts the overarching general patterns from the empirical data set which then fulfils three requirements 1 it contains the same set of species over time 2 it consists of long term frequent observations spanning multiple generations 3 it reveals the internally driven dynamics of the food web the last point is important because in lake constance predator prey interactions induce annually repeating changes in population abundances of several orders of magnitudes over a few weeks during the growing season boit and gaedke 2014 this makes lake constance an especially well suited case study for investigating growth states largely independent from external abiotic forcing data proportional population growth rates r i s in days 1 were estimated as differences in spline interpolated natural log biomass between successive days fig 3 hence the spline interpolation represents hypothetical daily observations during a typical year in lake constance daily growth rates represent the relevant time scale for investigating plankton dynamics in lake constance as the fastest eucaryotic organisms unicellular algae reproduce daily by division sommer 1985 which sets the pace of life for their multicellular predators e g daphnids with a generation time of about 1 week the first three principal components of the proportional population growth rates r s describe 78 of the variation in the seasonal cycle fig 4 the ordination suggests that the ecosystem in may june and july is relatively distinct from the rest of the year when proportional population growth rates are much closer to zero may and june are the late spring and clear water phases when the most extreme positive and negative proportional population growth rates occur fig 3 shaded areas while the ecosystem undergoes a major reorganization from an early resource driven to a more mature resource limited successional state boit and gaedke 2014 in particular in the late spring phase may characterized by algal dominance boit and gaedke 2014 most of the algal guilds alg2 alg3 alg4 alg5 fig 3b c d e autotrophic picoplankton app fig 3f and medium and large ciliates cil3 cil4 cil5 fig 3k l m have generally negative proportional population growth rates while single celled algae alg1 fig 3a rotifers asp rot1 rot2 rot3 fig 3g r s t cladocerans and calanoid copepods dap fig 3o and the cladocerans leptodora and bythotrephes lep fig 3q have generally positive proportional population growth rates in the clear water phase june characterized by temporary dominance of daphnids and a temporary inversion of the biomass pyramid boit and gaedke 2014 small coccal algae alg5 fig 3e autotrophic picoplankton app fig 3f and large carnivorous rotifers asp fig 3g have generally negative proportional population growth rates while most of the algae alg2 alg3 alg4 fig 3b c d ciliates cil1 cil2 cil3 cil5 fig 3i j k m and the cladocerans leptodora and bythotrephes lep fig 3q have generally positive proportional population growth rates in lake constance there are two annual peaks in size change corresponding roughly to the spring and summer blooms separated by a local minimum at the boundary between the late spring and clear water phases fig 5 a white line between shaded regions this local minimum occurs because at the start of the clear water phase most guilds have negative proportional population growth rates fig 3 due to dominance of daphnids boit and gaedke 2014 fig 1b in contrast shape change is highest in the late spring and clear water phases fig 5b shaded regions because although the proportional population growth rates are low for many guilds they vary substantially among guilds fig 3 thus shape change behaves very differently from lewis s measure of rate of succession lewis 1978 which has a deep local minimum between the spring and autumn blooms boit and gaedke 2014 fig 4b lewis s measure which is widely used by plankton ecologists is not a function of r s alone spencer 2015 appendix b and therefore is not a measure of growth state in the sense used here although scalar summaries are appealing in their simplicity two ecosystems with the same value of one or more of these functions may not be equivalent from the point of view of any species for example both size change and shape change in lake constance differ by less than 5 10 4 days 1 between days 37 and 210 fig 5 dashed lines and yet the ordination makes it clear that the growth state of the ecosystem is very different on these days fig 4 the open circles are far apart in fact 11 out of 20 guilds have proportional population growth rates with different signs between these days and the pearson correlation between proportional population growth rates on these dates is 0 33 to understand the differences in more detail it is necessary to look at the proportional population growth rates for each guild fig 6 the mean and standard deviation are almost identical on both days fig 6 filled black circles and vertical lines and the ranges are similar fig 6 symbols other than filled black circles nevertheless the identities of the guilds with proportional population growth rates far from zero differ considerably between the two days and no guild has exactly the same proportional population growth rate on both days fig 6 none of the coloured lines is horizontal the guild with the lowest proportional population growth rate on day 37 is alg3 filamentous blue and green algae which has the highest proportional population growth rate on day 210 the lep guild the cladocerans leptodora and bythotrephes has the highest proportional population growth rate on day 37 but a proportional population growth rate slightly below the mean fig 6 right hand filled circle on day 210 the cil1 guild small ciliates has the lowest proportional population growth rate on day 210 but a rate above the mean fig 6 left hand filled circle on day 37 in summary even a valid scalar summary of the growth state of an ecosystem such as size change or shape change may not give a good picture of the state of the ecosystem as experienced by any particular species 7 discussion we argued above that two ecosystem states are equivalent if and only if for each species the proportional population growth rate does not differ between the states much of community and ecosystem ecology is devoted to searching for patterns in variables such as species abundances or relative abundances measures of diversity and measures of complexity however we showed that except in special circumstances the dynamics of an ecosystem as experienced by the organisms in it in terms of proportional population growth rates will not be the same as the dynamics seen by an external observer who focuses on some other property a consequence of our argument is that many of the traditional activities of community and ecosystem ecology will not lead to a deeper understanding of how organisms experience ecosystems instead it may be more productive to search for patterns in proportional population growth rates this change in approach comes with new challenges such as finding appropriate ways to understand patterns in large numbers of proportional population growth rates it also opens up new perspectives on important existing topics such as alternative stable states the development of ecosystems over time and the processes generating regularities in ecosystems a natural consequence of the arguments developed here is that proportional population growth rates should occupy a more central position in community and ecosystem ecology just as they are currently at the heart of population ecology pásztor et al 2016 p 5 one challenge is that estimating proportional population growth rates is more difficult than estimating abundances in order to estimate proportional population growth rates abundance estimates must be obtained at a minimum of two time points however this difficulty is not insurmountable furthermore we propose to do more than just replace snapshots of abundance with monitoring changes over time by using proportional population growth rates as measures of ecosystem state properties other than abundances for example rates of nutrient cycling are implicitly considered to the extent that they are important to organisms through their effects on proportional population growth rates another challenge is that communities and ecosystems usually contain large numbers of species and it can be difficult to understand and summarize the resulting high dimensional patterns in proportional population growth rates we showed that an ordination based on principal components of proportional population growth rates fig 4 was able to describe most of the variation in growth state in lake constance we also showed in section 5 that it was possible to construct valid scalar summaries of the growth state of lake constance size change and shape change fig 5 however two dates with almost identical size change and shape change in fact had very different growth states because the identities of the guilds with proportional population growth rates far from zero were different fig 6 the dynamics of the two summary indices reveal the pattern of community reorganization during the clear water phase at one glance complementing the population level perspective overall the example from lake constance suggests that more thought is needed about the ecological meaning of summaries of growth state for example size change and shape change tell us about properties of typical taxa or guilds and of typical pairs of taxa or guilds respectively however they do not tell us about properties of particular taxa or guilds the same is true of the closely related living planet index loh et al 2005 an important statistic in global conservation biology the change from particular to aggregate properties demands a justification which is currently lacking in the same way that studying biodiversity per se an aggregate property rather than the particular species in an ecosystem each contributing to the aggregate property demands a justification maier 2012 pp 75 76 our approach can be used to generalize the idea of alternative stable states to that of alternative equivalent states identifying alternative stable states is a challenging problem petraitis 2013 however if these states contain the same set of species they are all equivalent to the organisms involved their distinctive feature is that the equivalence class in which all species have zero proportional population growth rate consists of more than one disjoint subset more generally when proportional population growth rates depend on multiple interacting resources each with a finite optimum value tilman 1980 it is easy to arrange equivalence classes for two or more species consisting of disjoint subsets in which proportional population growth rates are not all zero we call these alternative equivalent states such states may look very different in terms of abundances and physicochemical variables since it is easy to construct these geometrically we suggest that they will be common in nature a key theme in ecosystem ecology has been to identify regularities in ecosystem development e g odum 1969 a visual representation of patterns in growth space for a particular ecosystem e g fig 4 is purely exploratory nevertheless there is the potential to identify general patterns of dynamics in growth space based on the axiomatic approach to population dynamics advocated by lotka 1956 pp 57 66 hutchinson 1978 pp 1 5 and cropp and norbury 2012 2015 among others however the structural difference between dynamics of equivalence classes of ecosystem states and the dynamics of ecosystems has an important bearing on the kinds of regularities that a given mechanism can generate for example an influential if controversial idea in ecosystem ecology is that ecosystems are shaped by natural selection on the ability to capture energy lotka 1922 lotka s argument relies on the assumption that increased energy capture increases proportional population growth rate and can therefore be subject to natural selection lotka proposed that such selection on energy capture leads to maximization of biomass and energy flow at the ecosystem level however unpredictable external events may generate variation within equivalence classes which is invisible to natural selection thus natural selection cannot lead to regularities by eliminating such variation over time we argued above that equivalence classes may be disjoint containing ecosystems with quite different physicochemical properties if there are regularities at the ecosystem level either they must be at the level of equivalence classes or they must be generated by some mechanism other than natural selection stability selection is one such mechanism borrelli et al 2015 stability selection acts without seeing the local environment damuth and ginzburg 2019 or in other words it does not act via proportional population growth rates it is therefore unlinked from the equivalence classes of an ecosystem and may have the potential to generate regularities even within equivalence classes in conclusion we distinguish between the view of ecosystems taken by an external observer with the ability to study whatever they like and an organism in an ecosystem for whom proportional population growth rates are the only relevant aspect of ecosystem state this distinction leads to major differences in the approach that should be taken to comparative studies of ecosystems ecologists should focus on patterns in proportional population growth rates rather than patterns in other properties of ecosystems scalar summaries of these patterns such as size change and shape change are already available but can sometimes conceal important differences among ecosystem states the idea of alternative stable states can be generalized to equivalent ecosystem states with very different physicochemical properties finally since natural selection acts only on proportional population growth rates regularities in other aspects of ecosystem structure may not be explicable by natural selection acknowledgements this work was funded by nerc grant ne k00297x 1 we are grateful to lev ginzburg kevin gross and gregg milligan for thoughtful comments on an earlier version of this work to two anonymous reviewers for constructive criticism and to ursula gaedke for allowing us to use her lake constance data appendix a can dynamics on r have the same structure as dynamics on s to determine whether dynamics on r as experienced by organisms in the ecosystem can have the same structure as dynamics on s visible to an external observer we must first specify an endomap β on r that describes these dynamics a natural choice for β is a map taking r s to r α s the outcome of dynamics on ecosystems mapped to r if such a map exists thus suppose that z r s to get from z r s to β z r α s we have to first go back to s then apply α and finally go from the result of this to r the function r is not in general one one so it will not in general have a retraction r that undoes it in the sense that r r 1 s lawvere and schanuel 2009 p 53 however we can construct the function r r s s z s where s is an arbitrary representative of the set s s r s z then if the function r α r exists it is the natural choice for β on r s for elements of r outside the image set of s under r we can define β in an arbitrary way say β 1 r it is clear that we will not always be able to construct β in this way in fact if we cannot then there is no endomap on r such that r is a structure preserving map from s to r theorem 1 the map r s r can be a structure preserving map if and only if the endomap α on s satisfies the condition that a 1 s s α s α s s s s proof first we show that if condition a 1 holds then the endomap β on r is structure preserving if the condition holds then by the definition of s s r α s r α s then a 2 β r r z r α s if z r s z otherwise is a valid endomap on r because it has domain and codomain r and associates a single element of its codomain with each element of its domain it also satisfies r α β r and is therefore structure preserving theorem 1 makes intuitive sense condition a 1 says that for dynamics on the set of equivalence classes to preserve the structure in ecosystem dynamics the ecosystem dynamics must not separate equivalence classes for example in fig a 1 a the structure of α can be preserved by r for the natural choice of the endomap β on r described above because α keeps members of equivalence classes together in contrast in fig a 1b the structure of α cannot be preserved by r because s and s are in the same equivalence class but are mapped by α to different equivalence classes condition a 1 is somewhat analogous to the condition under which a function of a markov chain will be markovian burke and rosenblatt 1958 to find examples of endomaps α satisfying condition a 1 we first construct a function ϕ s s such that s s ϕ s ϕ s lemma 1 let ϕ be the function ϕ s s s s such that s s i e s is any fixed representative of the equivalence class of s on s then s s ϕ s ϕ s proof if s s then ϕ s ϕ s s conversely if s s then ϕ s s but ϕ s s since an equivalence relation on s partitions s halmos 1974 p 28 so that s cannot be equivalent to both s and s we can now rewrite condition a 1 as a 3 ϕ s ϕ s ϕ α s ϕ α s s s s this is simply an alternative way of saying that the endomap α on s must not separate members of equivalence classes appendix b frequency dependent dynamics suppose that proportional population growth rates in a closed system depend only on x through the relative abundances ρ i 1 n x i 1 x let ψ be a function from s n 1 ℝ 0 where the simplex s n 1 contains the relative abundances and ℝ 0 contains a time difference to ℝ n then for some time interval δt ecosystem dynamics α are given by α s s ω x y ω x ψ ρ δ t y where denotes the elementwise hadamard product hence for any given set of relative abundances ρ all ecosystems with abundances of the form c ρ for some positive number c map to ecosystems with abundances of the form c x ψ ρ δt also for each species i r i s lim δ t 0 ψ i ρ δ t 1 δ t which depends on x only through ρ thus all ecosystems with abundances of the form c ρ for fixed ρ will be in an equivalence class and will be mapped to the same new equivalence class by α 
25108,the lake ecosystem model pclake is a process based model that was developed to simulate water quality based on ecological interactions in shallow non stratifying lakes in the temperate climate zone here we present pclake which extends the pclake model to cover a wide range of freshwater lakes that differ in stratification regime and climate related processes to this end the model was extended with a hypolimnion layer that can be invoked and configured by forcing functions or by simple built in empirical relationships that impose stratification further adjustments to the original pclake model have been made with respect to the calculation of 1 light irradiation in the water column 2 evaporation processes and 3 phenology of macrophytes the simulation output of pclake for different types of lakes complies well with generally accepted limnological knowledge thus holding promise for future contributions to ecological theory and application to lakes around the globe keywords lake ecology food web model limnology deep lake shallow lake thermal stratification 1 introduction earth has over 117 million lakes with a surface larger than 2000 m2 verpoorter et al 2014 these lakes are of major importance for ecosystem services like drinking water food and human health paerl and otten 2013 environmental pressures such as eutrophication global warming land use change and overexploitation affect lake ecosystems and endanger the provision of these ecosystem services raworth 2017 rockström et al 2009 as a consequence of these pressures algal blooms are becoming increasingly frequent and severe paerl and huisman 2009 until now we often fail to predict and prevent algal blooms spears et al 2016 2017 water quality assessment of lake ecosystems is critical in understanding the development of algal blooms and in ultimately preventing them global assessment studies are of great importance to achieve this goal particularly in regions where fresh water is scarce however for many lakes there are no data available to assess their water quality in response to environmental change janssen et al 2019 messager et al 2016 moreover data themselves are not predictive cuddington et al 2013 therefore a modelling approach is needed for lake water quality assessment of lake ecosystems at a global scale mooij et al 2019 a large diversity of lake ecosystem models to assess water quality exists each with a level of complexity that matches its own purpose and niche janssen et al 2015 for instance there are lake ecosystem models that contain only a few equations that have shaped ecological theory such as minimal models on alternative stable states scheffer and van nes 2007 on the other side of the complexity spectrum lay frameworks that allow for a high level of detail and serve the purpose of simulating spatial heterogeneity in lakes e g fabm bruggeman and bolding 2014 delft3d waq eco los 2009 in between ecological models with an intermediate level of complexity combine relative short runtimes and limited data requirements of simple models with a level of complexity suitable to answer lake water quality related questions examples are one dimensional lake ecosystem models such as aquasim omlin et al 2001 mylake saloranta and andersen 2007 and pclake janse et al 2010 these models are in an excellent position to bridge theory with application and are also suitable for global assessment studies by coupling to global assessment models e g global news or image gnm beusen et al 2016 janse et al 2019 kroeze et al 2016 having an intermediate level of complexity pclake is potentially suitable for global studies on lake ecosystems compared with other models with an intermediate level of complexity pclake includes key lake food web components janssen et al 2015 ecological feedbacks between these food web components such as the interaction between macrophytes and algae are pivotal to critical nutrient loadings at which the ecosystem state shifts from a clear to turbid state or vice versa as pclake includes these key feedbacks within the food web the model is well suited to sudying impacts of eutrophication and oligorophication on lake ecology and water quality for instance the model has been used to assess critical nutrient loading of specific lakes hilt et al 2018 janse et al 2008 janssen et al 2017 kong et al 2016 kuiper et al 2017 to simulate the effect of climate warming on these critical nutrient loadings mooij et al 2007 nielsen et al 2014 and to assess the stability of ecosystems to disturbances around the critical nutrient loadings gsell et al 2016 kuiper et al 2015 the power of pclake lies in the coherence of the ecological process formulations minimal overhead and run time and limited required input its strong focus on ecology provides an alternative approach to physically oriented lake models that have their basis in hydrodynamic processes and comprehensive energy balances in lakes pclake was originally developed to simulate shallow non stratifying lake ecosystems in the temperate climate zone while applications of pclake to lakes in different climate zones have shown promising results e g janssen et al 2017 kong et al 2016 li et al 2019 the climate related processes need improvement for instance the phenology of macrophytes in pclake is too rigid for global applications and the light module does not yet account for latitudinal differences in light intensity additionally the assumption of a fully mixed water column does not hold for many lakes due to thermal stratification wetzel 2001 applying pclake to stratifying lakes while assuming a mixed water column will lead to incorrect estimations of relevant lake characteristics such as chlorophyll a and nutrient values janssen 2017 different modes of thermal stratification are defined in limnological theory lewis 1983 ostë et al 2010 wetzel 2001 we have included fig 1 for a graphical representation of these various modes shallow lakes are generally classified as polymictic lakes from greek polus much and miktos mixed because they are mixed throughout the year continuous polymictic or stratify multiple times for only short periods of time discontinuous polymictic andersen et al 2017 lewis 1996 deeper lakes are categorized as stratified lakes that mix either one period during winter warm monomictic lakes one period during summer cold monomictic lakes twice a year during spring and autumn dimictic lakes or not at all oligomictic or amictic lakes wetzel 2001 during stratification periods the upper and lower layers hardly mix due to temperature dependent density properties of water besides a heterogeneous distribution of temperature throughout the water column also nutrients suspended solids oxygen and various biological components distribute differently throughout the water column due to stratification jeppesen et al 2009 here we extend pclake to increase the model s application domain to a wide range of freshwater lakes that differ in thermal stratification modes and climate related processes fig 1 while staying as close as possible to the original model formulations and scientific niche in line with the intended focus on ecological processes in pclake we deliberately kept the implementation of stratification and climate related processes in pclake as simple as possible using either forcing functions or empirical relationships first we present the extensions made for thermal stratification and climate related processes in the model and thereafter elaborate on how to initialize the model next we tested whether the model reproduces expected patterns of oxygen nutrients and chlorophyll a based on basic limnological theory the full set of state variables parameters and equations can be found in the datm file at github https github com pcmodel datm files can be automatically translated to various programming languages including grind for matlab r acsl deft3d fortran and c mooij et al 2014 van gerven et al 2015 2 methods 2 1 general setup of pclake as in the original pclake pclake has been developed to simulate average ecological dynamics of a lake to this end the model was extended with a hypolimnion layer that can be invoked and configured by forcing functions or by simple build in empirical relationships that impose stratification see for methods below in case of continuous polymictic lakes pclake resembles the original pclake model with a single fully mixed water column janse 2005 in case of a stratifying lake the model was configured according to the schematization in fig 2 with the water column being divided into an epilimnion and a hypolimnion separated at mixing depth both water layers have their own state variables for nutrients oxygen three groups of algae detritus inorganic matter and zooplankton planktivorous fish benthivorous fish predatory fish and macrophytes are physically not restricted by stratification thus were each captured in a single biomass state variable for the entire water column river inflow and outflow of water were connected to the epilimnion whereas infiltration and seepage processes were connected to the hypolimnion similar to continuous polymictic lakes stratifying lakes may have a marsh zone with emergent macrophytes which was connected to the epilimnion below we give a thorough description on the implementation of stratification and climate related processes 2 2 implementation of stratification the presence of stratification or mixing can be initialized by the user calcmixdepth 0 or estimated by the model based on the dimensions of the lake calcmixdepth 1 during stratification periods there is limited exchange between the epilimnion and hypolimnion layer in absence of stratification advective and diffusive mixing processes take place between these layers 2 2 1 initialization of stratification by the user calcmixdepth 0 users may have information on the occurrence of stratification in their lake obtained from measurements or model simulations diverse statistical and mechanistic models exist to estimate the occurrence of stratification minns and shuter 2012 examples are the statistical model of ottosson and abrahamsson 1998 and the mechanistic models flake kirillin et al 2011 and glm hipsey et al 2013 two important steps need to be made in order to use measured or modelled input data that impose stratification upon the model first the mixing depth needs to be set using parameter cdepthmix the mixing depth is the depth of abrupt change in temperature in the thermal profile of the lake more complex temporal patterns in thermocline depth can also be imposed as a forcing function second the timing of stratification needs to be imposed in either of two ways one option is to set the parameter readstrat to 1 and use time series for mstrat with 1 representing stratification periods and 0 representing mixing periods the other option is to use temperature measurements over depth readstrat 0 the timing of stratification is then based on the time when the absolute difference between the surface and the bottom temperature of the lake exceeds a temperature threshold this threshold has default value of 1 c according to the minimum temperature difference between the epilimnion and hypolimnion found at which stratification may occur woolway et al 2014 similar to the original pclake model water temperature for both epilimnion and hypolimnion in pclake can be set based on measured data or simulation output from other models using forcing functions alternatively they can be calculated according to a cosine function that was already applied in the original version of pclake janse 2005 1 atmi ctmavei ctmvari cos 2π stime ctimelag daysinyear where i represents the layer epilimnion or hypolimnion atmi is the daily temperature in the specific layer ºc ctmavei is the average temperature in the specific layer ºc ctmvari is the maximum temperature variation in the specific layer ºc stime is the day of the year ctimelag the parameter days that determines at which day the minimum temperature is reached and daysinyear the number of days per year in case the resulting daily temperature falls below zero the water temperature will stagnate at zero degrees celsius as realistically ice formation will commence 2 2 2 initialization of stratification by the model calcmixdepth 1 in the case where the mixing depth is unknown first approximations are made by the model the approximated mixing depth is based on an empirical relationship which has proven applicable to a great diversity of lakes varying in size shape and geographical location hanna 1990 this empirical relationship estimates the mixing depth dmix m of a specific lake as function of the fetch f in m measured as the maximum length wind can blow over the lake surface in the predominant wind direction maximum effective length 2 dmix a fb with a 0 569 and b 0 336 hanna 1990 lakes can stratify if their depth extends below the mixing depth in all other cases lakes are classified as continuous polymictic lakes fig 3 similar to the user initialized stratification the method to approximate the timing of stratification is based on the difference in temperature between the epilimnion and the hypolimnion set by default at 1 c woolway et al 2014 2 3 implementation of climate related processes climate related processes of pclake differ from the original pclake in three ways 1 methods used to calculate light irradiation in the water column have been improved 2 the calculation of evaporation processes has been adjusted and 3 the representation of the phenology of macrophytes has been adjusted first the method used to calculate light irradiation w m2 was changed to broaden the model s applicability to different latitudes using the latitudinal position of the lake and the time of year the daily incoming radiation was calculated according to the equations from stull 2000 the daily incoming radiation was used to simulate the light profile in the epilimnion and hypolimnion if the user has information on the incoming light irradiance this information may be still imposed to the model instead of using these equations second a rough estimation of the evaporation can now be made using the thornthwaite equation thornthwaite 1948 using monthly irradiation and temperature again the user can impose time series of evaporation in case these data are available from measurements or model simulations the last adjustment made to the model was the timing of energy storage of macrophytes like the original model the state variable of macrophytes in pclake accounts for three functional groups of macrophytes floating submerged and emergent macrophytes in autumn macrophytes store their energy for surviving winter in propagules seeds or roots in the original pclake model the timing of energy storage was linked to a specific day in the year yet macrophytes are known to respond to physiological and environmental cues to determine timing of energy reallocation madsen 1991 van dijk and janse 1993 in pclake storage of energy by macrophytes to survive winter is now a function of light availability and the species specific minimum light needed for plant growth as an environmental cue hilt et al 2018 2 3 1 analysis and initialization similarly to pclake pclake can be used for transient and bifurcation analysis transient analysis is used to study temporal dynamics and impacts of the lake s history as captured by the initial conditions in case of transient analysis the user needs to carefully determine all initial state variables by using field data or estimates at time zero a major challenge in transient analysis is that the initial conditions are often partly unknown bifurcation analysis aims to study the equilibrium of the model in response to changes in parameters this technique is particularly suited for examining the presence of hysteresis due to alternative stable states e g scheffer and carpenter 2003 the procedure of bifurcation analysis in pclake was kept similar to the original version of pclake compared to transient analysis the exact determination of initial conditions is less important since bifurcation analysis depends on equilibria nevertheless it is important to define the initial conditions carefully because the initialization must be close enough to the equilibrium of a clear or turbid lake and far enough from the shifting point therefore we advise to first take an initialization step by running a newly parameterized model twice to equilibrium once with an extremely low for clear conditions and once with an extremely high nutrient load for turbid conditions importantly as the state variables in pclake are dynamic during the year equilibrium was defined here as recurring identical seasonal patterns for consecutive years the equilibrium values for all state variables in both clear and turbid conditions by the end of december 31st can then be used as initial values for the bifurcation analysis of the specific lake next to perform a bifurcation analysis a range of nutrient loadings needs to be selected for each nutrient loading value within this range the model needs to run twice to equilibrium once initialized for clear and another for turbid conditions the equilibrium output of interest commonly chlorophyll a needs then to be averaged over the year or growing season by plotting the averaged equilibrium chlorohyll a as function of nutrient load creates the typical final product of the bifurcation analysis a load response curve from this load response curve the critical nutrient load can be deducted as an abrupt change in chlorophyll a in case of a nonlinear curve or as a point where a maximum chlorophyll a level is exceeded in case the curve runs smoothly janssen et al 2015 initial state values for a standard deep lake are supplied in appendix a for comparability the default settings were chosen as close as possible to the default settings as defined by janse 2005 the default settings were based on a lake with an average depth of 15 m a fetch of 1000 m no marsh zone and with an external nutrient load with an n p ratio of 10 2 4 unit of state variables in the original pclake state variables in the water column were expressed as concentrations in order to easily connect to empirical water quality measurements to solve the mass balance in pclake however it proved necessary to express all state variables as masses per m2 instead of concentrations this is a direct result of the hydrodynamic components incorporated into the process descriptions of pclake and pclake the hydrodynamics are calculated in the same calculation step as biogeochemical dynamics therefore the lake water volume required to calculate concentrations is only known after the changes in substances are calculated since the concentrations of the next time step depend on the lake volume of the next time step determining exact concentrations for the next time step is in the effect not possible to solve the issue pclake has been rewritten to a mass based model in which all state variables are expressed in mass per meter squared in the initialization step initial values that are expressed in concentrations are converted into mass to accommodate the use of field measurements as an intermediated step within each time step of the calculation masses are converted back and forth to concentrations when needed in the equations moreover the user will find the final output as auxiliary values in concentrations to accommodate an easy comparison with field measurements 2 5 verification because the output for non stratifying lakes continuous polymictic lakes remained similar to the values reported by janse 2005 we verified the model with a focus on stratifying lakes we qualitatively verified model output in two steps starting with simulations for deep lakes 15 m and proceeding with simulations of shallow discontinuous polymictic lakes 1 2 m we verified the output based on comparison with basic limnological knowledge regarding changes in oxygen nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations corresponding with changes in stratification regimes below we describe the model settings used for simulations of both deep and shallow stratifying lakes and specify the expected limnological patterns 2 5 1 deep lakes for deep lakes we focused on lakes in climate regions that could undergo two different stratification regimes depending on the local weather conditions in particular we studied the model s response in key limnological variables around the following transitions in stratification regime 1 amictic lake monomictic cold lake 2 monomictic cold lake dimictic lake 3 dimictic lake monomictic warm lake and 4 monomictic warm lake oligomictic lake these transitions grossly occur in this order to decreasing latitude on the globe or along an altitudinal gradient to this end we simulated two hypothetical years in four lakes that differ slightly in water temperature such that the lake experiences a transition in stratification regime we have adjusted the variation in the epilimnetic water temperature ctmvarepi to simulate the four transitions since the focus is on the effects of the mixing regime rather than on the effect of temperature we varied the temperature minimally around the transitions see table 1 for the temperature settings used the mixing depths have been determined using eq 2 then we confronted the model results with basic limnological knowledge on the change in oxygen nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations when stratification regimes changes within a specific lake e g lewis 1983 wetzel 2001 according to general theory e g wetzel 2001 the transition from an amictic lake to a monomictic cold lake lake 1 results in a single mixing event in summer this mixing event brings anoxic and phosphate rich hypolimnion water to the surface causing an intense summer phytoplankton bloom wetzel 2001 the transition from a monomictic cold lake to a dimictic lake lake 2 allows the lake to mix twice rather than once with stratification during winter and a short period in summer the double mixing event could boost both a spring and late summer phytoplankton bloom due to the phosphate rich hypolimnion water the transition from a dimictic lake to a monomictic warm lake lake 3 allows the lake to mix once instead of twice with stratification during summer and mixing in winter the mixing in winter boosts mainly the spring phytoplankton bloom finally the transition from a monomictic warm lake to an oligomictic lake lake 4 results in a year round stratified lake since the phosphate rich hypolimnion water of an oligomictic lake hardly mixes with epilimnion water phytoplankton concentrations will be lower in the epilimnion compared to when the lake would experience mixing events 2 5 2 shallow lakes compared to deep lakes the period of thermal stratification in shallow discontinuous polymictic lakes is generally frequent but short with a duration of only a few hours to a couple of days padisák and reynolds 2003 vilas et al 2018 thermal stratification in shallow lakes occurs at sunny and windless days padisák and reynolds 2003 colonization of shallow lakes by macrophytes can enhance the period of stratification by dampening turbulence and absorbing heat andersen et al 2017 vilas et al 2018 for the hypothetical discontinuous polymictic shallow lake we simulated an oligotrophic lake colonized by macrophytes the mixing depth of this lake was manually set to 0 6 m the epilimnion temperature followed a cosine function eq 1 with an average of 12 c a variation of 10 c and small random variations to simulate weather changes we assumed that during summer months the resulting small temperature changes due to local weather were damped by macrophytes andersen et al 2017 vilas et al 2018 consequently the hypolimnion temperature was based on the cosine functions without these random temperature variations when temperature differences between epilimnion and hypolimnion were larger than 1 c stratification occured following limnological theory stratification in shallow lakes reduces the hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations andersen et al 2017 vilas et al 2018 as a result phosphate is released from sediments and hypolimnetic algal concentrations are expected to become higher than the epilimnetic algal concentrations because of sufficient light and nutrient availability andersen et al 2017 vilas et al 2018 3 results we developed pclake by expanding the properties of the existing ecological lake model pclake table 2 these changing properties have expanded the application domain of the model by including additional processes and a hypolimnion layer to the model we simulated four deep lakes 15 m and one shallow discontinuous polymictic lake 1 2 m to verify the model output of pclake against expected general limnological patterns 3 1 deep lakes the comparison of the simulation output for the four deep lakes with different stratification regimes is shown in fig 4 a lake in a climate region which can make the lake either amictic or monomictic cold fig 4 lake 1 differs in vertical patterns in oxygen phosphate and chlorophyll a depending on the regime it experiences due to the mixing event in summer when the lake was monomictic hypolimnetic phosphate rich water was mixed with the epilimnion this boosted a late summer chlorophyll a peak in autumn that was absent when the lake was amictic additionally the spring peak of algae was also higher when the lake is monomictic when lakes reside in a climate region that can make the lake either monomictic cold or dimictic fig 4 lake 2 the difference between these regimes was made by the presence of a short stratification event during summer in the dimictic situation the additional stratification period during summer allowed for the hypolimnion to become anoxic for a short period leading to higher hypolimnetic phosphate concentrations these increased concentrations led to a higher chlorophyll a peak during summer compared to the monomictic situation a lake located in a climate region which can make the lake either dimictic or monomictic warm fig 4 lake 3 results in respectively the presence or absence of a short stratification event during winter the difference in phosphate and chlorophyll a concentrations between both stratification regimes in such a lake was small as stratification occurs in winter when the biological activity is reduced chlorophyll a was slightly higher when the lake is monomictic warm but as this was observed throughout the year rather than a response directly after a mixing event this is likely a result of the small increase in annual temperature rather than stratification dynamics lastly we consider a lake in a climate region which can undergo either a short period of mixing monomictic warm or no mixing event at all oligomictic fig 4 lake 4 as the anoxic and phosphate rich hypolimnion water does not mix with the epilimnion the chlorophyll a concentration was lower in the oligomictic lake compared to the monomictic warm lake 3 2 shallow lakes the discontinuous polymictic shallow lake is stratified between the end of march when macrophytes start to grow until september fig 5 especially during spring the stratification periods were characterized by a slightly lower oxygen concentration in the hypolimnion the drop in oxygen levels was not very obvious since most stratification periods last for a few days maximum after which the hypolimnion was mixed again with the oxygen richer epilimnion the hypolimnetic chlorophyll a levels were higher than in the epilimnion even though the increase in phosphate levels was small high chlorophyll a values were possible due to the higher nutrient release from the hypolimnion while light availability was high later in the year macrophytes were so abundant that the light availability was not sufficient to sustain high hypolimetic algae concentrations 4 discussion with the further development of pclake into pclake we aim to increase the application domain of the model by including additional processes and a hypolimnion layer to the model our qualitative verification showed that pclake is able to simulate dynamics of stratifying lakes known from limnological theory in the original pclake model these dynamics are missing leading to unrealistic patterns in oxygen nutrients and chlorophyll a concentrations fig 4 compared to appendix b when applying pclake to stratifying lakes our qualitative verification against general limnological patterns is a first confirmation of the validity of the model a quantitative validation using a dataset of multiple lakes around the globe will be a next step in confirming the applicability of pclake to thermally stratified lake systems pclake offers a number of advantages over the original pclake model first anoxia caused by stratification and the associated increase of epilimnion phosphorus after mixing events were absent in the original pclake appendix b figure b 1 but is now an emergent property of pclake this facilitates a better simulation of the subsequent algae blooms after mixing appendix b figure b 2 additionally the incoming nutrients via rivers in pclake enter the system in the epilimnion layer instead of instantaneously mixing throughout the entire water column leading to more realistic estimates of nutrient availability in the epilimnion lastly in the original model all state variables including chlorophyll a were averaged over the entire water column whereas measurements are typically taken in the epilimnion especially in deep lakes large part of the water column is photosynthetically unproductive because of light limitation as a result taking an average of the entire column may lead to unrealistically low values of chlorophyll a compared to measurements if the lake is deep appendix b figure b 3 b 5 in pclake this is solved by splitting the water layer into two distinct compartments the epilimnion and the hypolimnion in order to compare emperical measurements from the epilimnion with epilimnion model output while the development of pclake has led to an increased application domain there are still open challenges first pclake accounts for stratification periods that last for at least one full day prescribed by the model s temporal resolution of one day simulation of stratification periods of a few hours that may occur in small lakes are thus beyond the scope of the model additionally we used empirical relationships to determine stratification depth and timing in case the user holds no data on stratification for global assessment studies this simplification is in most cases acceptable and even desirable we can envision future developments of the model to include brackish and salt lakes for which the model is currently unsuitable by adding chemical stratification and a good process description of the biochemical processes that strongly depend on sulphur reduction pclake would be suitable to also model brackish and salt lakes for future applications of pclake in global carbon studies the carbon cycles have to be extended including the addition of ph as state variable another obvious limitation of pclake is that feedbacks from ecological processes to hydrological and climate related processes are missing for instance hydrodynamic resistance of water flow by macrophytes or the influence of macrophytes on stratification is not covered by the model andersen et al 2017 van nes et al 2002 vilas et al 2018 in applications where such feedbacks are deemed to be important the biogeochemical components of pclake should be coupled with more sophisticated hydrodynamical frameworks such as fabm and delwaq hu et al 2016 janssen et al 2017 coupling of pclake to other models has additional advantage as simulations can then be run in various spatial settings to facilitate such coupling pclake is available in datm database approach to modelling mooij et al 2014 van gerven et al 2015 with datm the model code can be translated to various programming languages including grind for matlab r acsl delft3d fortran and c summarizing in the development of pclake we embraced the philosophy of the pcmodel family that ecology should be the core of the model while keeping the formulation of e g hydrodynamics and energy balances as simple as possible we foresee three application domains for pclake theoretical studies global assessment studies and case studies for specific lakes experiences with pclake have shown that the model is well suited for studying fundamental ecological mechanisms janssen et al 2017 kong et al 2016 kuiper et al 2017 within the application domain of global assessment studies where often large data gaps exist the generic and simplified assumptions in the default model settings allow broad estimates of a wide range of lakes in its application to specific lakes the model provides much flexibility to the user to impose temporal input data on e g temperature evaporation and stratification process originating from measurements or other models cf janssen et al 2017 kong et al 2016 as with any model the proof of the pudding is in the eating in this paper we assessed the model by 1 comparing the output with expert knowledge and 2 examining the model s sensitivity to different temperatures and lake depths but only in its application will pclake reveal its real strengths and weaknesses experiences with pclake showed that the domain of application of the model has changed over time the intended application domain of the original pclake model was eutrophication in temperate shallow lakes janse et al 2008 2010 thereafter however the model was successfully applied among others in climate studies mooij et al 2007 nielsen et al 2014 food web studies kuiper et al 2015 coupled with a spatially heterogeneous model hu et al 2016 janssen et al 2017 and showed its value when applied for temporal dependent input in the subtropical lakes janssen et al 2017 kong et al 2016 li et al 2019 our next step with pclake is a calibration and quantitative validation of the model s output in order to test for the generality of the model and to prevent overfitting we advocate a similar method as used to verify pclake by testing with a dataset containing multiple lakes around the globe rather than to verify for a single lake a subsequent step would be to apply pclake within an ensemble study in which multiple models are run based on a unified dataset analyzing the ensemble output would not only put pclake into perspective with other models but will also be useful for global assessments of lake ecosystems and related ecosystem services 5 conclusion with the development of pclake we have a model that is applicable to a wide range of both deep and shallow lakes around the world that exhibit various stratification regimes and experience different climatic conditions pclake maintains the philosophy of the pcmodel family with its focus on ecological dynamics the extended model produces the same output as the original pclake in case of continuous polymictic lakes which makes the model backward compatible the first output of pclake complies well with basic limnological knowledge for deep and discontinuous polymictic shallow lakes these results holds a promise for future model development and application to lakes around the globe conflicts of interest there is no competing interest to

25108,the lake ecosystem model pclake is a process based model that was developed to simulate water quality based on ecological interactions in shallow non stratifying lakes in the temperate climate zone here we present pclake which extends the pclake model to cover a wide range of freshwater lakes that differ in stratification regime and climate related processes to this end the model was extended with a hypolimnion layer that can be invoked and configured by forcing functions or by simple built in empirical relationships that impose stratification further adjustments to the original pclake model have been made with respect to the calculation of 1 light irradiation in the water column 2 evaporation processes and 3 phenology of macrophytes the simulation output of pclake for different types of lakes complies well with generally accepted limnological knowledge thus holding promise for future contributions to ecological theory and application to lakes around the globe keywords lake ecology food web model limnology deep lake shallow lake thermal stratification 1 introduction earth has over 117 million lakes with a surface larger than 2000 m2 verpoorter et al 2014 these lakes are of major importance for ecosystem services like drinking water food and human health paerl and otten 2013 environmental pressures such as eutrophication global warming land use change and overexploitation affect lake ecosystems and endanger the provision of these ecosystem services raworth 2017 rockström et al 2009 as a consequence of these pressures algal blooms are becoming increasingly frequent and severe paerl and huisman 2009 until now we often fail to predict and prevent algal blooms spears et al 2016 2017 water quality assessment of lake ecosystems is critical in understanding the development of algal blooms and in ultimately preventing them global assessment studies are of great importance to achieve this goal particularly in regions where fresh water is scarce however for many lakes there are no data available to assess their water quality in response to environmental change janssen et al 2019 messager et al 2016 moreover data themselves are not predictive cuddington et al 2013 therefore a modelling approach is needed for lake water quality assessment of lake ecosystems at a global scale mooij et al 2019 a large diversity of lake ecosystem models to assess water quality exists each with a level of complexity that matches its own purpose and niche janssen et al 2015 for instance there are lake ecosystem models that contain only a few equations that have shaped ecological theory such as minimal models on alternative stable states scheffer and van nes 2007 on the other side of the complexity spectrum lay frameworks that allow for a high level of detail and serve the purpose of simulating spatial heterogeneity in lakes e g fabm bruggeman and bolding 2014 delft3d waq eco los 2009 in between ecological models with an intermediate level of complexity combine relative short runtimes and limited data requirements of simple models with a level of complexity suitable to answer lake water quality related questions examples are one dimensional lake ecosystem models such as aquasim omlin et al 2001 mylake saloranta and andersen 2007 and pclake janse et al 2010 these models are in an excellent position to bridge theory with application and are also suitable for global assessment studies by coupling to global assessment models e g global news or image gnm beusen et al 2016 janse et al 2019 kroeze et al 2016 having an intermediate level of complexity pclake is potentially suitable for global studies on lake ecosystems compared with other models with an intermediate level of complexity pclake includes key lake food web components janssen et al 2015 ecological feedbacks between these food web components such as the interaction between macrophytes and algae are pivotal to critical nutrient loadings at which the ecosystem state shifts from a clear to turbid state or vice versa as pclake includes these key feedbacks within the food web the model is well suited to sudying impacts of eutrophication and oligorophication on lake ecology and water quality for instance the model has been used to assess critical nutrient loading of specific lakes hilt et al 2018 janse et al 2008 janssen et al 2017 kong et al 2016 kuiper et al 2017 to simulate the effect of climate warming on these critical nutrient loadings mooij et al 2007 nielsen et al 2014 and to assess the stability of ecosystems to disturbances around the critical nutrient loadings gsell et al 2016 kuiper et al 2015 the power of pclake lies in the coherence of the ecological process formulations minimal overhead and run time and limited required input its strong focus on ecology provides an alternative approach to physically oriented lake models that have their basis in hydrodynamic processes and comprehensive energy balances in lakes pclake was originally developed to simulate shallow non stratifying lake ecosystems in the temperate climate zone while applications of pclake to lakes in different climate zones have shown promising results e g janssen et al 2017 kong et al 2016 li et al 2019 the climate related processes need improvement for instance the phenology of macrophytes in pclake is too rigid for global applications and the light module does not yet account for latitudinal differences in light intensity additionally the assumption of a fully mixed water column does not hold for many lakes due to thermal stratification wetzel 2001 applying pclake to stratifying lakes while assuming a mixed water column will lead to incorrect estimations of relevant lake characteristics such as chlorophyll a and nutrient values janssen 2017 different modes of thermal stratification are defined in limnological theory lewis 1983 ostë et al 2010 wetzel 2001 we have included fig 1 for a graphical representation of these various modes shallow lakes are generally classified as polymictic lakes from greek polus much and miktos mixed because they are mixed throughout the year continuous polymictic or stratify multiple times for only short periods of time discontinuous polymictic andersen et al 2017 lewis 1996 deeper lakes are categorized as stratified lakes that mix either one period during winter warm monomictic lakes one period during summer cold monomictic lakes twice a year during spring and autumn dimictic lakes or not at all oligomictic or amictic lakes wetzel 2001 during stratification periods the upper and lower layers hardly mix due to temperature dependent density properties of water besides a heterogeneous distribution of temperature throughout the water column also nutrients suspended solids oxygen and various biological components distribute differently throughout the water column due to stratification jeppesen et al 2009 here we extend pclake to increase the model s application domain to a wide range of freshwater lakes that differ in thermal stratification modes and climate related processes fig 1 while staying as close as possible to the original model formulations and scientific niche in line with the intended focus on ecological processes in pclake we deliberately kept the implementation of stratification and climate related processes in pclake as simple as possible using either forcing functions or empirical relationships first we present the extensions made for thermal stratification and climate related processes in the model and thereafter elaborate on how to initialize the model next we tested whether the model reproduces expected patterns of oxygen nutrients and chlorophyll a based on basic limnological theory the full set of state variables parameters and equations can be found in the datm file at github https github com pcmodel datm files can be automatically translated to various programming languages including grind for matlab r acsl deft3d fortran and c mooij et al 2014 van gerven et al 2015 2 methods 2 1 general setup of pclake as in the original pclake pclake has been developed to simulate average ecological dynamics of a lake to this end the model was extended with a hypolimnion layer that can be invoked and configured by forcing functions or by simple build in empirical relationships that impose stratification see for methods below in case of continuous polymictic lakes pclake resembles the original pclake model with a single fully mixed water column janse 2005 in case of a stratifying lake the model was configured according to the schematization in fig 2 with the water column being divided into an epilimnion and a hypolimnion separated at mixing depth both water layers have their own state variables for nutrients oxygen three groups of algae detritus inorganic matter and zooplankton planktivorous fish benthivorous fish predatory fish and macrophytes are physically not restricted by stratification thus were each captured in a single biomass state variable for the entire water column river inflow and outflow of water were connected to the epilimnion whereas infiltration and seepage processes were connected to the hypolimnion similar to continuous polymictic lakes stratifying lakes may have a marsh zone with emergent macrophytes which was connected to the epilimnion below we give a thorough description on the implementation of stratification and climate related processes 2 2 implementation of stratification the presence of stratification or mixing can be initialized by the user calcmixdepth 0 or estimated by the model based on the dimensions of the lake calcmixdepth 1 during stratification periods there is limited exchange between the epilimnion and hypolimnion layer in absence of stratification advective and diffusive mixing processes take place between these layers 2 2 1 initialization of stratification by the user calcmixdepth 0 users may have information on the occurrence of stratification in their lake obtained from measurements or model simulations diverse statistical and mechanistic models exist to estimate the occurrence of stratification minns and shuter 2012 examples are the statistical model of ottosson and abrahamsson 1998 and the mechanistic models flake kirillin et al 2011 and glm hipsey et al 2013 two important steps need to be made in order to use measured or modelled input data that impose stratification upon the model first the mixing depth needs to be set using parameter cdepthmix the mixing depth is the depth of abrupt change in temperature in the thermal profile of the lake more complex temporal patterns in thermocline depth can also be imposed as a forcing function second the timing of stratification needs to be imposed in either of two ways one option is to set the parameter readstrat to 1 and use time series for mstrat with 1 representing stratification periods and 0 representing mixing periods the other option is to use temperature measurements over depth readstrat 0 the timing of stratification is then based on the time when the absolute difference between the surface and the bottom temperature of the lake exceeds a temperature threshold this threshold has default value of 1 c according to the minimum temperature difference between the epilimnion and hypolimnion found at which stratification may occur woolway et al 2014 similar to the original pclake model water temperature for both epilimnion and hypolimnion in pclake can be set based on measured data or simulation output from other models using forcing functions alternatively they can be calculated according to a cosine function that was already applied in the original version of pclake janse 2005 1 atmi ctmavei ctmvari cos 2π stime ctimelag daysinyear where i represents the layer epilimnion or hypolimnion atmi is the daily temperature in the specific layer ºc ctmavei is the average temperature in the specific layer ºc ctmvari is the maximum temperature variation in the specific layer ºc stime is the day of the year ctimelag the parameter days that determines at which day the minimum temperature is reached and daysinyear the number of days per year in case the resulting daily temperature falls below zero the water temperature will stagnate at zero degrees celsius as realistically ice formation will commence 2 2 2 initialization of stratification by the model calcmixdepth 1 in the case where the mixing depth is unknown first approximations are made by the model the approximated mixing depth is based on an empirical relationship which has proven applicable to a great diversity of lakes varying in size shape and geographical location hanna 1990 this empirical relationship estimates the mixing depth dmix m of a specific lake as function of the fetch f in m measured as the maximum length wind can blow over the lake surface in the predominant wind direction maximum effective length 2 dmix a fb with a 0 569 and b 0 336 hanna 1990 lakes can stratify if their depth extends below the mixing depth in all other cases lakes are classified as continuous polymictic lakes fig 3 similar to the user initialized stratification the method to approximate the timing of stratification is based on the difference in temperature between the epilimnion and the hypolimnion set by default at 1 c woolway et al 2014 2 3 implementation of climate related processes climate related processes of pclake differ from the original pclake in three ways 1 methods used to calculate light irradiation in the water column have been improved 2 the calculation of evaporation processes has been adjusted and 3 the representation of the phenology of macrophytes has been adjusted first the method used to calculate light irradiation w m2 was changed to broaden the model s applicability to different latitudes using the latitudinal position of the lake and the time of year the daily incoming radiation was calculated according to the equations from stull 2000 the daily incoming radiation was used to simulate the light profile in the epilimnion and hypolimnion if the user has information on the incoming light irradiance this information may be still imposed to the model instead of using these equations second a rough estimation of the evaporation can now be made using the thornthwaite equation thornthwaite 1948 using monthly irradiation and temperature again the user can impose time series of evaporation in case these data are available from measurements or model simulations the last adjustment made to the model was the timing of energy storage of macrophytes like the original model the state variable of macrophytes in pclake accounts for three functional groups of macrophytes floating submerged and emergent macrophytes in autumn macrophytes store their energy for surviving winter in propagules seeds or roots in the original pclake model the timing of energy storage was linked to a specific day in the year yet macrophytes are known to respond to physiological and environmental cues to determine timing of energy reallocation madsen 1991 van dijk and janse 1993 in pclake storage of energy by macrophytes to survive winter is now a function of light availability and the species specific minimum light needed for plant growth as an environmental cue hilt et al 2018 2 3 1 analysis and initialization similarly to pclake pclake can be used for transient and bifurcation analysis transient analysis is used to study temporal dynamics and impacts of the lake s history as captured by the initial conditions in case of transient analysis the user needs to carefully determine all initial state variables by using field data or estimates at time zero a major challenge in transient analysis is that the initial conditions are often partly unknown bifurcation analysis aims to study the equilibrium of the model in response to changes in parameters this technique is particularly suited for examining the presence of hysteresis due to alternative stable states e g scheffer and carpenter 2003 the procedure of bifurcation analysis in pclake was kept similar to the original version of pclake compared to transient analysis the exact determination of initial conditions is less important since bifurcation analysis depends on equilibria nevertheless it is important to define the initial conditions carefully because the initialization must be close enough to the equilibrium of a clear or turbid lake and far enough from the shifting point therefore we advise to first take an initialization step by running a newly parameterized model twice to equilibrium once with an extremely low for clear conditions and once with an extremely high nutrient load for turbid conditions importantly as the state variables in pclake are dynamic during the year equilibrium was defined here as recurring identical seasonal patterns for consecutive years the equilibrium values for all state variables in both clear and turbid conditions by the end of december 31st can then be used as initial values for the bifurcation analysis of the specific lake next to perform a bifurcation analysis a range of nutrient loadings needs to be selected for each nutrient loading value within this range the model needs to run twice to equilibrium once initialized for clear and another for turbid conditions the equilibrium output of interest commonly chlorophyll a needs then to be averaged over the year or growing season by plotting the averaged equilibrium chlorohyll a as function of nutrient load creates the typical final product of the bifurcation analysis a load response curve from this load response curve the critical nutrient load can be deducted as an abrupt change in chlorophyll a in case of a nonlinear curve or as a point where a maximum chlorophyll a level is exceeded in case the curve runs smoothly janssen et al 2015 initial state values for a standard deep lake are supplied in appendix a for comparability the default settings were chosen as close as possible to the default settings as defined by janse 2005 the default settings were based on a lake with an average depth of 15 m a fetch of 1000 m no marsh zone and with an external nutrient load with an n p ratio of 10 2 4 unit of state variables in the original pclake state variables in the water column were expressed as concentrations in order to easily connect to empirical water quality measurements to solve the mass balance in pclake however it proved necessary to express all state variables as masses per m2 instead of concentrations this is a direct result of the hydrodynamic components incorporated into the process descriptions of pclake and pclake the hydrodynamics are calculated in the same calculation step as biogeochemical dynamics therefore the lake water volume required to calculate concentrations is only known after the changes in substances are calculated since the concentrations of the next time step depend on the lake volume of the next time step determining exact concentrations for the next time step is in the effect not possible to solve the issue pclake has been rewritten to a mass based model in which all state variables are expressed in mass per meter squared in the initialization step initial values that are expressed in concentrations are converted into mass to accommodate the use of field measurements as an intermediated step within each time step of the calculation masses are converted back and forth to concentrations when needed in the equations moreover the user will find the final output as auxiliary values in concentrations to accommodate an easy comparison with field measurements 2 5 verification because the output for non stratifying lakes continuous polymictic lakes remained similar to the values reported by janse 2005 we verified the model with a focus on stratifying lakes we qualitatively verified model output in two steps starting with simulations for deep lakes 15 m and proceeding with simulations of shallow discontinuous polymictic lakes 1 2 m we verified the output based on comparison with basic limnological knowledge regarding changes in oxygen nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations corresponding with changes in stratification regimes below we describe the model settings used for simulations of both deep and shallow stratifying lakes and specify the expected limnological patterns 2 5 1 deep lakes for deep lakes we focused on lakes in climate regions that could undergo two different stratification regimes depending on the local weather conditions in particular we studied the model s response in key limnological variables around the following transitions in stratification regime 1 amictic lake monomictic cold lake 2 monomictic cold lake dimictic lake 3 dimictic lake monomictic warm lake and 4 monomictic warm lake oligomictic lake these transitions grossly occur in this order to decreasing latitude on the globe or along an altitudinal gradient to this end we simulated two hypothetical years in four lakes that differ slightly in water temperature such that the lake experiences a transition in stratification regime we have adjusted the variation in the epilimnetic water temperature ctmvarepi to simulate the four transitions since the focus is on the effects of the mixing regime rather than on the effect of temperature we varied the temperature minimally around the transitions see table 1 for the temperature settings used the mixing depths have been determined using eq 2 then we confronted the model results with basic limnological knowledge on the change in oxygen nutrient and chlorophyll a concentrations when stratification regimes changes within a specific lake e g lewis 1983 wetzel 2001 according to general theory e g wetzel 2001 the transition from an amictic lake to a monomictic cold lake lake 1 results in a single mixing event in summer this mixing event brings anoxic and phosphate rich hypolimnion water to the surface causing an intense summer phytoplankton bloom wetzel 2001 the transition from a monomictic cold lake to a dimictic lake lake 2 allows the lake to mix twice rather than once with stratification during winter and a short period in summer the double mixing event could boost both a spring and late summer phytoplankton bloom due to the phosphate rich hypolimnion water the transition from a dimictic lake to a monomictic warm lake lake 3 allows the lake to mix once instead of twice with stratification during summer and mixing in winter the mixing in winter boosts mainly the spring phytoplankton bloom finally the transition from a monomictic warm lake to an oligomictic lake lake 4 results in a year round stratified lake since the phosphate rich hypolimnion water of an oligomictic lake hardly mixes with epilimnion water phytoplankton concentrations will be lower in the epilimnion compared to when the lake would experience mixing events 2 5 2 shallow lakes compared to deep lakes the period of thermal stratification in shallow discontinuous polymictic lakes is generally frequent but short with a duration of only a few hours to a couple of days padisák and reynolds 2003 vilas et al 2018 thermal stratification in shallow lakes occurs at sunny and windless days padisák and reynolds 2003 colonization of shallow lakes by macrophytes can enhance the period of stratification by dampening turbulence and absorbing heat andersen et al 2017 vilas et al 2018 for the hypothetical discontinuous polymictic shallow lake we simulated an oligotrophic lake colonized by macrophytes the mixing depth of this lake was manually set to 0 6 m the epilimnion temperature followed a cosine function eq 1 with an average of 12 c a variation of 10 c and small random variations to simulate weather changes we assumed that during summer months the resulting small temperature changes due to local weather were damped by macrophytes andersen et al 2017 vilas et al 2018 consequently the hypolimnion temperature was based on the cosine functions without these random temperature variations when temperature differences between epilimnion and hypolimnion were larger than 1 c stratification occured following limnological theory stratification in shallow lakes reduces the hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations andersen et al 2017 vilas et al 2018 as a result phosphate is released from sediments and hypolimnetic algal concentrations are expected to become higher than the epilimnetic algal concentrations because of sufficient light and nutrient availability andersen et al 2017 vilas et al 2018 3 results we developed pclake by expanding the properties of the existing ecological lake model pclake table 2 these changing properties have expanded the application domain of the model by including additional processes and a hypolimnion layer to the model we simulated four deep lakes 15 m and one shallow discontinuous polymictic lake 1 2 m to verify the model output of pclake against expected general limnological patterns 3 1 deep lakes the comparison of the simulation output for the four deep lakes with different stratification regimes is shown in fig 4 a lake in a climate region which can make the lake either amictic or monomictic cold fig 4 lake 1 differs in vertical patterns in oxygen phosphate and chlorophyll a depending on the regime it experiences due to the mixing event in summer when the lake was monomictic hypolimnetic phosphate rich water was mixed with the epilimnion this boosted a late summer chlorophyll a peak in autumn that was absent when the lake was amictic additionally the spring peak of algae was also higher when the lake is monomictic when lakes reside in a climate region that can make the lake either monomictic cold or dimictic fig 4 lake 2 the difference between these regimes was made by the presence of a short stratification event during summer in the dimictic situation the additional stratification period during summer allowed for the hypolimnion to become anoxic for a short period leading to higher hypolimnetic phosphate concentrations these increased concentrations led to a higher chlorophyll a peak during summer compared to the monomictic situation a lake located in a climate region which can make the lake either dimictic or monomictic warm fig 4 lake 3 results in respectively the presence or absence of a short stratification event during winter the difference in phosphate and chlorophyll a concentrations between both stratification regimes in such a lake was small as stratification occurs in winter when the biological activity is reduced chlorophyll a was slightly higher when the lake is monomictic warm but as this was observed throughout the year rather than a response directly after a mixing event this is likely a result of the small increase in annual temperature rather than stratification dynamics lastly we consider a lake in a climate region which can undergo either a short period of mixing monomictic warm or no mixing event at all oligomictic fig 4 lake 4 as the anoxic and phosphate rich hypolimnion water does not mix with the epilimnion the chlorophyll a concentration was lower in the oligomictic lake compared to the monomictic warm lake 3 2 shallow lakes the discontinuous polymictic shallow lake is stratified between the end of march when macrophytes start to grow until september fig 5 especially during spring the stratification periods were characterized by a slightly lower oxygen concentration in the hypolimnion the drop in oxygen levels was not very obvious since most stratification periods last for a few days maximum after which the hypolimnion was mixed again with the oxygen richer epilimnion the hypolimnetic chlorophyll a levels were higher than in the epilimnion even though the increase in phosphate levels was small high chlorophyll a values were possible due to the higher nutrient release from the hypolimnion while light availability was high later in the year macrophytes were so abundant that the light availability was not sufficient to sustain high hypolimetic algae concentrations 4 discussion with the further development of pclake into pclake we aim to increase the application domain of the model by including additional processes and a hypolimnion layer to the model our qualitative verification showed that pclake is able to simulate dynamics of stratifying lakes known from limnological theory in the original pclake model these dynamics are missing leading to unrealistic patterns in oxygen nutrients and chlorophyll a concentrations fig 4 compared to appendix b when applying pclake to stratifying lakes our qualitative verification against general limnological patterns is a first confirmation of the validity of the model a quantitative validation using a dataset of multiple lakes around the globe will be a next step in confirming the applicability of pclake to thermally stratified lake systems pclake offers a number of advantages over the original pclake model first anoxia caused by stratification and the associated increase of epilimnion phosphorus after mixing events were absent in the original pclake appendix b figure b 1 but is now an emergent property of pclake this facilitates a better simulation of the subsequent algae blooms after mixing appendix b figure b 2 additionally the incoming nutrients via rivers in pclake enter the system in the epilimnion layer instead of instantaneously mixing throughout the entire water column leading to more realistic estimates of nutrient availability in the epilimnion lastly in the original model all state variables including chlorophyll a were averaged over the entire water column whereas measurements are typically taken in the epilimnion especially in deep lakes large part of the water column is photosynthetically unproductive because of light limitation as a result taking an average of the entire column may lead to unrealistically low values of chlorophyll a compared to measurements if the lake is deep appendix b figure b 3 b 5 in pclake this is solved by splitting the water layer into two distinct compartments the epilimnion and the hypolimnion in order to compare emperical measurements from the epilimnion with epilimnion model output while the development of pclake has led to an increased application domain there are still open challenges first pclake accounts for stratification periods that last for at least one full day prescribed by the model s temporal resolution of one day simulation of stratification periods of a few hours that may occur in small lakes are thus beyond the scope of the model additionally we used empirical relationships to determine stratification depth and timing in case the user holds no data on stratification for global assessment studies this simplification is in most cases acceptable and even desirable we can envision future developments of the model to include brackish and salt lakes for which the model is currently unsuitable by adding chemical stratification and a good process description of the biochemical processes that strongly depend on sulphur reduction pclake would be suitable to also model brackish and salt lakes for future applications of pclake in global carbon studies the carbon cycles have to be extended including the addition of ph as state variable another obvious limitation of pclake is that feedbacks from ecological processes to hydrological and climate related processes are missing for instance hydrodynamic resistance of water flow by macrophytes or the influence of macrophytes on stratification is not covered by the model andersen et al 2017 van nes et al 2002 vilas et al 2018 in applications where such feedbacks are deemed to be important the biogeochemical components of pclake should be coupled with more sophisticated hydrodynamical frameworks such as fabm and delwaq hu et al 2016 janssen et al 2017 coupling of pclake to other models has additional advantage as simulations can then be run in various spatial settings to facilitate such coupling pclake is available in datm database approach to modelling mooij et al 2014 van gerven et al 2015 with datm the model code can be translated to various programming languages including grind for matlab r acsl delft3d fortran and c summarizing in the development of pclake we embraced the philosophy of the pcmodel family that ecology should be the core of the model while keeping the formulation of e g hydrodynamics and energy balances as simple as possible we foresee three application domains for pclake theoretical studies global assessment studies and case studies for specific lakes experiences with pclake have shown that the model is well suited for studying fundamental ecological mechanisms janssen et al 2017 kong et al 2016 kuiper et al 2017 within the application domain of global assessment studies where often large data gaps exist the generic and simplified assumptions in the default model settings allow broad estimates of a wide range of lakes in its application to specific lakes the model provides much flexibility to the user to impose temporal input data on e g temperature evaporation and stratification process originating from measurements or other models cf janssen et al 2017 kong et al 2016 as with any model the proof of the pudding is in the eating in this paper we assessed the model by 1 comparing the output with expert knowledge and 2 examining the model s sensitivity to different temperatures and lake depths but only in its application will pclake reveal its real strengths and weaknesses experiences with pclake showed that the domain of application of the model has changed over time the intended application domain of the original pclake model was eutrophication in temperate shallow lakes janse et al 2008 2010 thereafter however the model was successfully applied among others in climate studies mooij et al 2007 nielsen et al 2014 food web studies kuiper et al 2015 coupled with a spatially heterogeneous model hu et al 2016 janssen et al 2017 and showed its value when applied for temporal dependent input in the subtropical lakes janssen et al 2017 kong et al 2016 li et al 2019 our next step with pclake is a calibration and quantitative validation of the model s output in order to test for the generality of the model and to prevent overfitting we advocate a similar method as used to verify pclake by testing with a dataset containing multiple lakes around the globe rather than to verify for a single lake a subsequent step would be to apply pclake within an ensemble study in which multiple models are run based on a unified dataset analyzing the ensemble output would not only put pclake into perspective with other models but will also be useful for global assessments of lake ecosystems and related ecosystem services 5 conclusion with the development of pclake we have a model that is applicable to a wide range of both deep and shallow lakes around the world that exhibit various stratification regimes and experience different climatic conditions pclake maintains the philosophy of the pcmodel family with its focus on ecological dynamics the extended model produces the same output as the original pclake in case of continuous polymictic lakes which makes the model backward compatible the first output of pclake complies well with basic limnological knowledge for deep and discontinuous polymictic shallow lakes these results holds a promise for future model development and application to lakes around the globe conflicts of interest there is no competing interest to

25109,shifting cultivation jhum and forest land are the main land uses in north eastern region of indian himalaya but in the long term this form of agriculture is not acceptable due to the soil degradation following the cutting of forest vegetation and the consequent biodiversity loss high erosion rates and nutrient loss through runoff no information on soil organic carbon soc dynamics and simulation studies are available so an attempt was done using rothc model the model was parameterized on measured soc contents of forest and jhum sites and average soc stocks and changes were simulated for a period of 5 years in forest and jhum sites under the baseline and the projected climate change conditions available for nagaland state 2021 2050 forest sites under the baseline climate showed a steady state condition and simulated soc decreased by 0 04 t c ha 1 yr 1during 5 years in addition simulations indicated that forest land use could not benefit from climate change in a 10 years period soc changes showed a decreasing trend from 0 36 to 0 06 t c ha 1 yr 1 jhum sites showed negative changes in soc stocks both under the baseline 0 40 t c ha 1 yr 1 and the projected climate change conditions 0 50 t c ha 1 yr 1 indeed soc decreases under climate change were inversely related to the duration of the jhum cropping cycle almost linear in the first five years from 0 65 to 0 41 t c ha 1 yr 1 and thereafter only slightly decreasing from 0 39 to 0 32 t c ha 1 yr 1 we can conclude that under climate change conditions the jhum cropping cycle can be extended for a longer period without substantial effects on soc decreases keywords climate change forests jhum land north eastern himalaya of india rothc soil organic carbon 1 introduction forests are one of the most important ecosystems of the earth due to their biodiversity ecosystems services and capacity to offset climate change impact through carbon sequestration basu 2009 rahman et al 2017 however due to anthropogenic pressure many of the forests are under stress brandon 2014 conversion of forest land to agricultural land by slash and burn is known as shifting cultivation and is locally called jhum cultivation singh et al 2014 a common practice in africa asia and latin america and this contributes to 70 50 and 16 of total deforestation respectively fao 1957 inoue et al 2010 chaplot et al 2010 van vliet et al 2012 grogan et al 2012 jhum cultivation is an ancient practice which consists of repetitive cycles cutting the forest vegetation leaving the biomass in situ to dry burning the slashed vegetation after drying and growing annual and perennial crops for a variable period of time depending on the region the ash deposits after burning helps to fertilize the soil after the end of the cycle the field is abandoned and the natural vegetation will grow secondary forest while the farmer jhumia will move to another site due to geographical position and biodiversity richness the north eastern region of indian himalaya neh is considered as one of the twelve biodiversity hot spots in the world choudhury et al 2016 it is covered by forests 65 agricultural land 16 and fallow for the rest saha et al 2012 approximately 86 of the total cultivated area of neh is under the practice of jhum cultivation and also is the major source of livelihood for the local peoples patel et al 2013 yadav 2013 however during the last few decades this practice has led to rapid change in land use especially in nagaland chase and singh 2014 continuous jhumming and changes in land use has also aggravated the issues related to soil degradation biodiversity loss and climate change salehi et al 2008 chase and singh 2014 a wide number of studies have been done throughout the world using different models and land uses to understand the soil carbon dynamics at different temporal scales campbell and paustian 2015 and brilli et al 2017 recently reviewed and discussed different simulation models available worldwide commonly used for studies on soc dynamics ghgs emissions and climate change mitigation since simulated results provide information on the global carbon cycle including the changes in soc over time and soil carbon dioxide emissions models differ in the complexity and requirements of input information peltoniemi et al 2007 and simple models need less complicated and less detailed input information than complex models for example rothc coleman and jenkinson 2014 requires only basic input data whereas century parton et al 1987 is more complex and the input data requirement is high both models have a similar structure containing pools with rapid moderate and slow turnover rothc has been used in different countries and ecosystems including grassland agriculture and forest in the uk and iran coleman et al 1997 farzanmanesh et al 2016 forests in austria palosuo et al 2012 australia paul et al 2003 brazil cerri et al 2007 iran soleimani et al 2017 spain romanya et al 2000 and zambia kaonga and coleman 2008 olive groves in spain nieto et al 2010 land use and land use change in italy francaviglia et al 2012 farina et al 2017 arable crops in australia senapati et al 2014 china guo et al 2007 ludwig et al 2010 li et al 2016 germany ludwig et al 2007 and kenya kamoni et al 2007 unfortunately neither information related to soc dynamics nor simulation studies are available for the north eastern region of indian himalaya neh thus we used the rothc model in this study to simulate the patterns of soc stocks in two major land uses forest and jhum lands of this region evaluate the response to future climate change projections and provide better insights for climate change mitigation in the region as well as assistance in the management strategies in a long term perspective 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study sites were located in dimapur and kohima districts of nagaland state in the north eastern region of indian himalaya neh nagaland

climate change projections for baseline climate the monthly values of average air temperature precipitation and open pan evaporation were obtained from the 19 year 1998 2016 data of the indian council

projections district data have been derived by re gridding the precis model outputs at 0 2 0 2 resolution baseline and climate change projections for dimapur and kohima districts of nagaland are shown in fig 1 2 3 soil sampling and analysis in 2010 a total of 26 sites were surveyed and soil samples 30 cm depth were collected from forest 14 and jhum 12 lands fig 2 similarly 13 soil samples were collected in 2016 from the same land uses forest 8 and jhum 5 after sampling the soil samples were stored in polyethylene bags and subsequently processed prior to laboratory analysis the samples were air dried at room temperature to constant weight and sieved through 2 mm sieve to exclude litter roots and coarse particles particle size analysis was carried out by hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 and bulk density bd by core method blake and hartge 1986 soil organic carbon soc was determined using k2cr2o7 wet oxidation method walkley and black 1934 main soil characteristics are shown in table 1 soil organic c stocks were calculated with the formula 1 soc c bd d where soc indicates the soil organic carbon stock t c ha 1 c is the percentage of organic carbon content bd is the bulk density g cm 3 and d is thickness cm 2 4 description of rothc model the rothc model simulates the long term dynamics of soil organic carbon soc and co2 emissions in topsoil for different vegetation types including arable crops grasslands and forests the model has a monthly step and requires a limited number of input data monthly climate temperature precipitation and pan evaporation soil clay content soil cover information whether the soil is bare or under vegetation cover since decomposition is faster in bare soils quantity and quality of returned plant residues to soil and farmyard manure inputs fym if any coleman and jenkinson 2014 soc dynamics is simulated using four active compartments i e decomposable plant material dpm resistant plant material rpm microbial biomass bio and humiﬁed organic matter hum and an inert organic matter iom compartment which is resistant to decomposition and does not take part in c turnover coleman and jenkinson 2014 iom t c ha 1 is calculated from soc using the equation proposed by falloon et al 1998 2 iom 0 049 soc1 139 the model partitions the incoming quantity of plant residues into decomposable plant material dpm and resistant plant material rpm depending on the dpm rpm ratio quality of residues dpm and rpm decompose to form co2 bio and hum in proportions based on the clay content the bio hum is then split into 46 bio and 54 hum and both bio and hum decompose to form more co2 bio and hum fig 3 in the present study the rothc model version 26 3 coleman and jenkinson 2014 was used to simulate soc dynamics the input data to run rothc simulations are included in two files land management file contains the monthly inputs of plant residues and farmyard manure in t c ha 1 and the soil cover information i e whether the soil is bare 0 or covered 1 weather file includes the monthly values of temperature c precipitation mm and pan evaporation mm besides clay content and soil depth cm 2 5 model parametrization rothc 26 3 is designed to run in two modes forward in which known carbon inputs are used to calculate the changes in soil organic matter and inverse when carbon inputs are calculated at equilibrium state for 10 000 years from known changes in soil organic matter briefly the model was firstly run at equilibrium in inverse mode based on the known total soil carbon content clay content average climatic conditions and the presence of vegetation cover in the forest land use during the whole year during this initialization process in inverse mode the model automatically calculated the inert organic matter iom from the known soc content used as input and iteratively calculated plant carbon inputs to be included in the land management file until the simulated soc stock matched the measured soc stock in the forest land use fig 3 thereafter the model was run in the forward mode with a short term simulation for calibration in the jhum land use considering the presence of vegetation cover for six months may to december and starting from the equilibrium conditions of forest land use the new carbon inputs required to match as close as possible the measured soc data of jhum sites in the calibration step were manually calculated fig 3 residual quality factor dpm rpm ratio was set to the default values for arable and woodland respectively i e 1 44 for jhum and 0 25 for forests coleman and jenkinson 2014 following the scheme reported in table 2 two independent sets of simulations were run for the two sampling years 2010 and 2016 using the average measured soc values and their standard deviation sd to provide a range of soc stocks variations table 3 first sampling 2010 the model was run at equilibrium inverse mode for forest f1 in 2010 average climate 1998 2010 with the three measured soc stocks average average sd and average sd and the c inputs iteratively calculated by the model then the management file was modified with a short term simulation forward mode for calibration on jhum j1 average climate 2006 2010 to match the three soc stocks average average sd and average sd measured in 2010 calibration and the c inputs were manually calculated in detail average soc of jhum j1 was calibrated from average soc of forest f1 at equilibrium average sd from average sd of forest f1 and average sd from average sd of forest f1 second sampling 2016 the model was run at equilibrium inverse mode for forest f2 in 2016 average climate 1998 2016 with the three measured soc stocks average average sd and average sd and the c inputs iteratively calculated by the model then the management file was modified with a short term simulation forward mode for calibration on jhum j2 average climate 2012 2016 to match the three soc stocks average average sd and average sd measured in 2016 calibration and the c inputs were manually calculated in detail average soc of jhum j2 was calibrated from average soc of forest f2 at equilibrium average sd from average sd of forest f2 and average sd from average sd of forest f2 shifting cultivations jhum consists of repetitive cycles with a variable period from 2 to 9 years maithani 2005 kumar et al 2016a mishra et al 2017 and 5 years can be considered an intermediate length therefore soc changes were simulated for a period of 5 years after the sampling using the equilibrium calibration soc stocks in forest and jhum sites respectively fig 3 to derive the changes of soc stocks in t c ha 1yr 1 for the two sampling periods under the baseline climatic conditions fig 4 a for f1 and f2 forest sites average and average sd simulations were run with the same management files of equilibrium simulations but using the yearly climates 2006 2010 and 2012 2016 respectively for j1 and j2 jhum sites average and average sd simulations were run with the same management files of calibration simulations but using the yearly climates 2006 2010 and 2012 2016 respectively analogously fig 3 simulations were run for a period of 5 years to derive the average soc stocks and changes for the two land uses and sampling periods under the projected climate change conditions 2021 2050 previously described fig 4b a further set of simulations under climate change conditions was run for a period of 10 years to provide information about soc dynamics in a longer term for a possible extension of the jhum cropping cycle fig 5 for jhum sites simulated yearly and total soc losses under climate change conditions were also calculated from year 1 to 5 and from year 6 to 10 of cultivation fig 6 total soc losses were calculated considering the area of jhum fields bhalerao et al 2015a b in the two districts of dimapur 7800 ha and kohima 5420 ha 2 6 indicators of model performance the overall agreement of model predictions with the measured values of soc stocks in the jhum sites was tested using the correlation coefficient r2 the root mean square error rmse and the modeling efficiency ef 3 r 2 i 1 n s i o o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 4 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 1 2 5 ef 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where si and oi are the i th simulated and observed values respectively s and o the average simulated and observed soc values respectively and n the total number of observations the lowest possible value of rmse is zero indicating that there is no difference between simulated and observed data if the model accurately describes the measured data rmse should have approximately the same order of magnitude of the standard deviation smith and smith 2007 ef can range from to 1 with the best performance at ef 1 negative values indicate that simulated values do not describe the data as well as the mean of the observations 3 results 3 1 carbon stocks carbon inputs and model results measured soc stocks were lower in jhum land use j1 and j2 compared with forest sites f1 and f2 in both sampling years tables 1 and 2 in particular average stocks were 32 7 and 38 3 t c ha 1 in jhum j1 and forest f1 respectively in 2010 14 6 lower in jhum j1 5 6 t c ha 1 considering the standard deviations soc was 14 5 14 8 lower in jhum j1 2 9 to 8 3 t c ha 1 average stocks in 2016 were 37 0 and 47 7 t c ha 1 in jhum j2 and forest f2 respectively 22 5 lower in jhum j2 10 7 t c ha 1 considering the standard deviations soc was 1 7 32 2 lower in jhum j2 0 5 to 21 0 t c ha 1 average calculated carbon inputs table 3 were 5 5 and 6 7 t c ha 1 for forest sites f1 and f2 respectively at equilibrium 6 6 t c ha 1 for jhum sites j1 after calibration from forest f1 and 5 0 t c ha 1 for jhum sites j2 after calibration from forest f2 however measured c inputs for forest land uses in the region are very scarce and no data exist for jhum cultivation thus we assessed if c inputs calculated with rothc were consistent with observations available from other studies in forest sites rathore et al 2010 indicated a litter yield of 13 56 t ha 1 for alnus trees that with a c content of 45 johnson et al 2006 would provide a litter input of 6 10 t c t ha 1 gosain et al 2015 reported a c input to forest floor through litter fall equal to 4 21 tc ha 1 for pine forests similarly litter fall values in pine forests have been reported ranging from 4 2 to 6 5 tc ha 1 yr 1 by singh and singh 1992 thus researches are in good agreement with the c inputs calculated with rothc at equilibrium for forest sites 5 47 and 6 72 t c t ha 1 in f1 and f2 respectively for jhum land use we considered rice as main cultivation and estimated the annual c inputs by the formulas derived from kong et al 2005 kuzyakov and domanski 2000 skjemstad et al 2004 based on yields harvest index hi and shoot root ratio s r based on the field research carried out by kumar et al 2016b according to the local farmers practice these rice parameters were 3 31 t ha 1 0 40 and 0 80 respectively total c inputs ctot were calculated by the equation 6 ctot cs cr ce cw were cs cr ce and cw are c from stubble in roots in root exudates and weeds respectively in detail 7 cs 0 1 yield hi 0 45 8 cr yield hi s r 0 45 9 ce 0 09 yield hi 0 45 10 cw 0 07 yield hi 0 45 applying eq 6 ctot was 5 62 t c t ha 1 in good agreement with the average value of jhum sites obtained by the calibration of rothc 5 82 t c t ha 1 3 2 model validation following the equilibrium simulations in the forest sites we simulated the conversion to jhum land use and rothc results were validated using the three indicators of model performance previously described see materials and methods section the agreement between measured and simulated data was quite good since r2 rmse and ef were 0 989 0 029 and 0 999 respectively and the standard deviation of the measured values was also higher than rmse with a value of 11 45 based on these results we can affirm that rothc predictions are fully acceptable for the purpose of this modeling exercise and can be used to simulate soc stock changes under the baseline and climate change conditions as described in the following section 3 3 simulated carbon stock changes under the baseline climatic conditions and compared to the equilibrium simulated values for forest sites fig 4a average soc stocks during the five years of simulation after samplings decreased by 0 22 t c ha 1 and the yearly change was 0 04 t c ha 1 yr 1 when compared to the calibrated values for jhum sites average soc stocks for jhum land use in the same period decreased by 2 00 t c ha 1 and the yearly change was 0 40 t c ha 1 yr 1 fig 4a the analogous simulations results under the projected climate change projections for a period of 5 years fig 4b showed an average soc stocks change of 1 03 t c ha 1 in forest sites and the average yearly change was 0 21 t c ha 1 yr 1 conversely soc stocks decreased by 2 51 t c ha 1 in jhum sites with a yearly decrease equal to 0 50 t c ha 1 yr 1as average yearly soc changes in forest and jhum sites during a period of 10 years under climate change conditions were interpolated by a polynomial equation fig 5 to evaluate the effect on soc stocks following a possible extension of the jhum cropping cycle for a longer time of period results indicated an average yearly soc decrease in jhum sites equal to 0 43 t c ha 1 yr 1 lower than the average decrease during the 5 years simulation 0 50 t c ha 1 yr 1 in detail soc decrease was inversely related to the duration of the cropping cycle almost linear in the first five years from 0 65 to 0 41 t c ha 1 yr 1 and thereafter was only slightly decreasing from 0 39 to 0 32 t c ha 1 yr 1 at the same time soc change in forest sites was 0 14 t c ha 1 yr 1 as average lower than the average change during the 5 years simulation 0 21 t c ha 1 yr 1 analogously to jhum sites soc change was almost linearly declining in the first five years in forest sites from 0 36 to 0 11 t c ha 1 yr 1 and thereafter was slightly declining from 0 09 to 0 06 t c ha 1 yr 1 considering the total area of jhum fields in dimapur and kohima districts 13 220 ha yearly and total soc loss during jhum cropping cycle were more pronounced from year 1 to 5 of cultivation and equal to 3225 t c yr 1 and 25 kt c respectively fig 6a from year 6 to 10 yearly soc losses decreased to 897 t c yr 1 and total soc losses to 18 kt c fig 6b 4 discussion forest sites under the baseline climate showed slightly negative soc stocks changes indicating a steady state condition and thus can be considered sustainable in the humid subtropical climate conditions of dimapur and kohima districts of nagaland state in addition model simulations showed a decreasing trend of soc stocks under the projected climate change conditions for forest sites indicating that this land use could not benefit from climate change due to temperature and precipitation effects in a long term perspective for example if simulations would be projected to longer periods e g 30 years in detail soc stocks would change by about 1 2 t c ha 1during five years compared to the baseline conditions 1 03 vs 0 22 t c ha 1 with a yearly change equal 0 25 t c ha 1 yr 1 0 21 vs 0 04 t c ha 1 yr 1 jhum sites showed negative changes in soc stocks during the five years of simulation both under the baseline and under the projected climate change conditions but in the latter case the further decrease was equal to 0 51 t c ha 1 2 00 vs 2 51 t c ha 1 with an additional slight yearly decrease of 0 10 t c ha 1 yr 1 for jhum sites simulated yearly and total soc losses were higher from year 1 to 5 37 4 and 5 4 respectively compared to year 6 to 10 17 6 and 4 3 respectively again showing that soc decreases could be substantially higher when jhum cycle was shorter beyond all inherent uncertainties in the use of simulation models we did not know how many jhum cycles took place after the shifting from forest in the selected sites before soil samplings other uncertainties could derive from climate change projections since in rothc soc decomposition rates are governed by plant carbon inputs and are nonlinear functions of temperature and soil moisture patterns coleman and jenkinson 2014 thus climate has a primary influence on predicted soil carbon trends in this study both temperature and precipitations increased under climate change but giorgi and lionello 2008 indicated that precipitation projections are less robust than those of temperature since precipitation involves local processes of more considerable complexity than temperature nevertheless the simulated effects on soc dynamics are quite reasonable as already mentioned in the introduction section no simulation studies are available for soc dynamics in shifting cultivation thus we can only compare the measured soc stocks with similar findings in the same area choudhury et al 2016 studied soc stocks in neh region under different land uses including shifting cultivation presently cultivated for different durations 2 8 years results were in good agreement with our findings and indicated a significant lower soc stock in jhum 27 4 t c ha 1 compared with the dense forest land use 35 2 t c ha 1 but not significant in comparison with the open forest sites 30 1 t c ha 1 shifting cultivation showed about 22 less soc stock than the dense forests but only 9 less that the open forests mishra et al 2017 assessed soil quality under shifting cultivation and forest sites in wokha district of nagaland neh and average soc stocks were 17 2 lower in jhum 46 9 t c ha 1 than in forest sites 56 6 t c ha 1 according to kumar et al 2016a the reduced cropping cycle is among the main constraints leading to a decline in the productivity and profitability of jhum fields mainly because of the population increase and consequent increase in the demand for food while the earlier cycle was 10 15 years the present length is not enough to restore the functional capacity of soils after the initial forest clearing and burning in the early stages of plantations in addition shifting cultivation practices deteriorate soil fertility due to high soil losses by erosion and a minimum period of 10 15 years would be essential to maintain the soil fertility for sustainable crop production anyhow farmers harvest the crops by cutting or picking the economically important part for instance paddy panicle or maize cob leaving the crop residues on the slope of the hills which can help to protect the soil from erosion as well as enhance fertility after the decomposition kuotsuo et al 2014 kumar et al 2016b also reported that short jhum cycles 5 years have lower fertility than those with longer cycles indeed during the first year of jhum cultivation soil may have a better nutrient status which can be lost in the following years due to leaching and runoff from sloping fields mishra et al 2017 further constraints in jhum agriculture are water scarcity during the post monsoon winter seasons lack of awareness about improved agriculture technologies and vegetable cultivation and mono cropping with traditional practices and management different scientific interventions in soil water and nutrient conservation and crops can be undertaken to address these constraints kumar et al 2016a terracing of existing jhum land for wet rice based farming systems increasing of cropping intensity by introducing short duration crops after rice fallow introduction of high yielding crops varieties and adoption of improved agro techniques restoration of degraded jhum lands through agroforestry based farming systems water harvesting techniques for multiple purpose uses and horticulture based farming systems 5 conclusions according to the nagaland state action plan on climate change 2012 jhum land intensification and extension of cropping cycle is one of the key programs of research in agriculture to be addressed by adopting improved farming practices and fallow management systems so that productivity in jhum areas would increase in the present study the rothc model was parameterized on measured soc contents of forest and jhum sites thereafter was used to simulate the dynamics of soc under climate change conditions for a period of ten years and results showed that the jhum cropping cycle can be extended for a longer period without substantial effects on soc decreases this target could be matched provided that jhum lands are properly managed through cultivating the jhum for longer periods and managing the fallow period length conversion of further forests to jhum agriculture is not acceptable due to the soil degradation deriving from erosion and nutrient loss through runoff for this reason we recommend that further research in agriculture would be coupled with soil water and nutrient conservation measures as well as crop management practices with the aim to store more c in soil and improve soil quality in jhum fields acknowledgements we greatly acknowledge the financial support from the indian council of forestry research and education we wish to thank the forest department of nagaland for their support during the field visits and data collection last but not least we thank all the staff of rain forest research institute jorhat assam who have knowingly or unknowingly provided their help support and cooperation in completing the study 
25109,shifting cultivation jhum and forest land are the main land uses in north eastern region of indian himalaya but in the long term this form of agriculture is not acceptable due to the soil degradation following the cutting of forest vegetation and the consequent biodiversity loss high erosion rates and nutrient loss through runoff no information on soil organic carbon soc dynamics and simulation studies are available so an attempt was done using rothc model the model was parameterized on measured soc contents of forest and jhum sites and average soc stocks and changes were simulated for a period of 5 years in forest and jhum sites under the baseline and the projected climate change conditions available for nagaland state 2021 2050 forest sites under the baseline climate showed a steady state condition and simulated soc decreased by 0 04 t c ha 1 yr 1during 5 years in addition simulations indicated that forest land use could not benefit from climate change in a 10 years period soc changes showed a decreasing trend from 0 36 to 0 06 t c ha 1 yr 1 jhum sites showed negative changes in soc stocks both under the baseline 0 40 t c ha 1 yr 1 and the projected climate change conditions 0 50 t c ha 1 yr 1 indeed soc decreases under climate change were inversely related to the duration of the jhum cropping cycle almost linear in the first five years from 0 65 to 0 41 t c ha 1 yr 1 and thereafter only slightly decreasing from 0 39 to 0 32 t c ha 1 yr 1 we can conclude that under climate change conditions the jhum cropping cycle can be extended for a longer period without substantial effects on soc decreases keywords climate change forests jhum land north eastern himalaya of india rothc soil organic carbon 1 introduction forests are one of the most important ecosystems of the earth due to their biodiversity ecosystems services and capacity to offset climate change impact through carbon sequestration basu 2009 rahman et al 2017 however due to anthropogenic pressure many of the forests are under stress brandon 2014 conversion of forest land to agricultural land by slash and burn is known as shifting cultivation and is locally called jhum cultivation singh et al 2014 a common practice in africa asia and latin america and this contributes to 70 50 and 16 of total deforestation respectively fao 1957 inoue et al 2010 chaplot et al 2010 van vliet et al 2012 grogan et al 2012 jhum cultivation is an ancient practice which consists of repetitive cycles cutting the forest vegetation leaving the biomass in situ to dry burning the slashed vegetation after drying and growing annual and perennial crops for a variable period of time depending on the region the ash deposits after burning helps to fertilize the soil after the end of the cycle the field is abandoned and the natural vegetation will grow secondary forest while the farmer jhumia will move to another site due to geographical position and biodiversity richness the north eastern region of indian himalaya neh is considered as one of the twelve biodiversity hot spots in the world choudhury et al 2016 it is covered by forests 65 agricultural land 16 and fallow for the rest saha et al 2012 approximately 86 of the total cultivated area of neh is under the practice of jhum cultivation and also is the major source of livelihood for the local peoples patel et al 2013 yadav 2013 however during the last few decades this practice has led to rapid change in land use especially in nagaland chase and singh 2014 continuous jhumming and changes in land use has also aggravated the issues related to soil degradation biodiversity loss and climate change salehi et al 2008 chase and singh 2014 a wide number of studies have been done throughout the world using different models and land uses to understand the soil carbon dynamics at different temporal scales campbell and paustian 2015 and brilli et al 2017 recently reviewed and discussed different simulation models available worldwide commonly used for studies on soc dynamics ghgs emissions and climate change mitigation since simulated results provide information on the global carbon cycle including the changes in soc over time and soil carbon dioxide emissions models differ in the complexity and requirements of input information peltoniemi et al 2007 and simple models need less complicated and less detailed input information than complex models for example rothc coleman and jenkinson 2014 requires only basic input data whereas century parton et al 1987 is more complex and the input data requirement is high both models have a similar structure containing pools with rapid moderate and slow turnover rothc has been used in different countries and ecosystems including grassland agriculture and forest in the uk and iran coleman et al 1997 farzanmanesh et al 2016 forests in austria palosuo et al 2012 australia paul et al 2003 brazil cerri et al 2007 iran soleimani et al 2017 spain romanya et al 2000 and zambia kaonga and coleman 2008 olive groves in spain nieto et al 2010 land use and land use change in italy francaviglia et al 2012 farina et al 2017 arable crops in australia senapati et al 2014 china guo et al 2007 ludwig et al 2010 li et al 2016 germany ludwig et al 2007 and kenya kamoni et al 2007 unfortunately neither information related to soc dynamics nor simulation studies are available for the north eastern region of indian himalaya neh thus we used the rothc model in this study to simulate the patterns of soc stocks in two major land uses forest and jhum lands of this region evaluate the response to future climate change projections and provide better insights for climate change mitigation in the region as well as assistance in the management strategies in a long term perspective 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study sites were located in dimapur and kohima districts of nagaland state in the north eastern region of indian himalaya neh nagaland

climate change projections for baseline climate the monthly values of average air temperature precipitation and open pan evaporation were obtained from the 19 year 1998 2016 data of the indian council

in fig 1 2 3 soil sampling and analysis in 2010 a total of 26 sites were surveyed and soil samples 30 cm depth were collected from forest 14 and jhum 12 lands fig 2 similarly 13 soil samples were collected in 2016 from the same land uses forest 8 and jhum 5 after sampling the soil samples were stored in polyethylene bags and subsequently processed prior to laboratory analysis the samples were air dried at room temperature to constant weight and sieved through 2 mm sieve to exclude litter roots and coarse particles particle size analysis was carried out by hydrometer method gee and bauder 1986 and bulk density bd by core method blake and hartge 1986 soil organic carbon soc was determined using k2cr2o7 wet oxidation method walkley and black 1934 main soil characteristics are shown in table 1 soil organic c stocks were calculated with the formula 1 soc c bd d where soc indicates the soil organic carbon stock t c ha 1 c is the percentage of organic carbon content bd is the bulk density g cm 3 and d is thickness cm 2 4 description of rothc model the rothc model simulates the long term dynamics of soil organic carbon soc and co2 emissions in topsoil for different vegetation types including arable crops grasslands and forests the model has a monthly step and requires a limited number of input data monthly climate temperature precipitation and pan evaporation soil clay content soil cover information whether the soil is bare or under vegetation cover since decomposition is faster in bare soils quantity and quality of returned plant residues to soil and farmyard manure inputs fym if any coleman and jenkinson 2014 soc dynamics is simulated using four active compartments i e decomposable plant material dpm resistant plant material rpm microbial biomass bio and humiﬁed organic matter hum and an inert organic matter iom compartment which is resistant to decomposition and does not take part in c turnover coleman and jenkinson 2014 iom t c ha 1 is calculated from soc using the equation proposed by falloon et al 1998 2 iom 0 049 soc1 139 the model partitions the incoming quantity of plant residues into decomposable plant material dpm and resistant plant material rpm depending on the dpm rpm ratio quality of residues dpm and rpm decompose to form co2 bio and hum in proportions based on the clay content the bio hum is then split into 46 bio and 54 hum and both bio and hum decompose to form more co2 bio and hum fig 3 in the present study the rothc model version 26 3 coleman and jenkinson 2014 was used to simulate soc dynamics the input data to run rothc simulations are included in two files land management file contains the monthly inputs of plant residues and farmyard manure in t c ha 1 and the soil cover information i e whether the soil is bare 0 or covered 1 weather file includes the monthly values of temperature c precipitation mm and pan evaporation mm besides clay content and soil depth cm 2 5 model parametrization rothc 26 3 is designed to run in two modes forward in which known carbon inputs are used to calculate the changes in soil organic matter and inverse when carbon inputs are calculated at equilibrium state for 10 000 years from known changes in soil organic matter briefly the model was firstly run at equilibrium in inverse mode based on the known total soil carbon content clay content average climatic conditions and the presence of vegetation cover in the forest land use during the whole year during this initialization process in inverse mode the model automatically calculated the inert organic matter iom from the known soc content used as input and iteratively calculated plant carbon inputs to be included in the land management file until the simulated soc stock matched the measured soc stock in the forest land use fig 3 thereafter the model was run in the forward mode with a short term simulation for calibration in the jhum land use considering the presence of vegetation cover for six months may to december and starting from the equilibrium conditions of forest land use the new carbon inputs required to match as close as possible the measured soc data of jhum sites in the calibration step were manually calculated fig 3 residual quality factor dpm rpm ratio was set to the default values for arable and woodland respectively i e 1 44 for jhum and 0 25 for forests coleman and jenkinson 2014 following the scheme reported in table 2 two independent sets of simulations were run for the two sampling years 2010 and 2016 using the average measured soc values and their standard deviation sd to provide a range of soc stocks variations table 3 first sampling 2010 the model was run at equilibrium inverse mode for forest f1 in 2010 average climate 1998 2010 with the three measured soc stocks average average sd and average sd and the c inputs iteratively calculated by the model then the management file was modified with a short term simulation forward mode for calibration on jhum j1 average climate 2006 2010 to match the three soc stocks average average sd and average sd measured in 2010 calibration and the c inputs were manually calculated in detail average soc of jhum j1 was calibrated from average soc of forest f1 at equilibrium average sd from average sd of forest f1 and average sd from average sd of forest f1 second sampling 2016 the model was run at equilibrium inverse mode for forest f2 in 2016 average climate 1998 2016 with the three measured soc stocks average average sd and average sd and the c inputs iteratively calculated by the model then the management file was modified with a short term simulation forward mode for calibration on jhum j2 average climate 2012 2016 to match the three soc stocks average average sd and average sd measured in 2016 calibration and the c inputs were manually calculated in detail average soc of jhum j2 was calibrated from average soc of forest f2 at equilibrium average sd from average sd of forest f2 and average sd from average sd of forest f2 shifting cultivations jhum consists of repetitive cycles with a variable period from 2 to 9 years maithani 2005 kumar et al 2016a mishra et al 2017 and 5 years can be considered an intermediate length therefore soc changes were simulated for a period of 5 years after the sampling using the equilibrium calibration soc stocks in forest and jhum sites respectively fig 3 to derive the changes of soc stocks in t c ha 1yr 1 for the two sampling periods under the baseline climatic conditions fig 4 a for f1 and f2 forest sites average and average sd simulations were run with the same management files of equilibrium simulations but using the yearly climates 2006 2010 and 2012 2016 respectively for j1 and j2 jhum sites average and average sd simulations were run with the same management files of calibration simulations but using the yearly climates 2006 2010 and 2012 2016 respectively analogously fig 3 simulations were run for a period of 5 years to derive the average soc stocks and changes for the two land uses and sampling periods under the projected climate change conditions 2021 2050 previously described fig 4b a further set of simulations under climate change conditions was run for a period of 10 years to provide information about soc dynamics in a longer term for a possible extension of the jhum cropping cycle fig 5 for jhum sites simulated yearly and total soc losses under climate change conditions were also calculated from year 1 to 5 and from year 6 to 10 of cultivation fig 6 total soc losses were calculated considering the area of jhum fields bhalerao et al 2015a b in the two districts of dimapur 7800 ha and kohima 5420 ha 2 6 indicators of model performance the overall agreement of model predictions with the measured values of soc stocks in the jhum sites was tested using the correlation coefficient r2 the root mean square error rmse and the modeling efficiency ef 3 r 2 i 1 n s i o o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 4 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 1 2 5 ef 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where si and oi are the i th simulated and observed values respectively s and o the average simulated and observed soc values respectively and n the total number of observations the lowest possible value of rmse is zero indicating that there is no difference between simulated and observed data if the model accurately describes the measured data rmse should have approximately the same order of magnitude of the standard deviation smith and smith 2007 ef can range from to 1 with the best performance at ef 1 negative values indicate that simulated values do not describe the data as well as the mean of the observations 3 results 3 1 carbon stocks carbon inputs and model results measured soc stocks were lower in jhum land use j1 and j2 compared with forest sites f1 and f2 in both sampling years tables 1 and 2 in particular average stocks were 32 7 and 38 3 t c ha 1 in jhum j1 and forest f1 respectively in 2010 14 6 lower in jhum j1 5 6 t c ha 1 considering the standard deviations soc was 14 5 14 8 lower in jhum j1 2 9 to 8 3 t c ha 1 average stocks in 2016 were 37 0 and 47 7 t c ha 1 in jhum j2 and forest f2 respectively 22 5 lower in jhum j2 10 7 t c ha 1 considering the standard deviations soc was 1 7 32 2 lower in jhum j2 0 5 to 21 0 t c ha 1 average calculated carbon inputs table 3 were 5 5 and 6 7 t c ha 1 for forest sites f1 and f2 respectively at equilibrium 6 6 t c ha 1 for jhum sites j1 after calibration from forest f1 and 5 0 t c ha 1 for jhum sites j2 after calibration from forest f2 however measured c inputs for forest land uses in the region are very scarce and no data exist for jhum cultivation thus we assessed if c inputs calculated with rothc were consistent with observations available from other studies in forest sites rathore et al 2010 indicated a litter yield of 13 56 t ha 1 for alnus trees that with a c content of 45 johnson et al 2006 would provide a litter input of 6 10 t c t ha 1 gosain et al 2015 reported a c input to forest floor through litter fall equal to 4 21 tc ha 1 for pine forests similarly litter fall values in pine forests have been reported ranging from 4 2 to 6 5 tc ha 1 yr 1 by singh and singh 1992 thus researches are in good agreement with the c inputs calculated with rothc at equilibrium for forest sites 5 47 and 6 72 t c t ha 1 in f1 and f2 respectively for jhum land use we considered rice as main cultivation and estimated the annual c inputs by the formulas derived from kong et al 2005 kuzyakov and domanski 2000 skjemstad et al 2004 based on yields harvest index hi and shoot root ratio s r based on the field research carried out by kumar et al 2016b according to the local farmers practice these rice parameters were 3 31 t ha 1 0 40 and 0 80 respectively total c inputs ctot were calculated by the equation 6 ctot cs cr ce cw were cs cr ce and cw are c from stubble in roots in root exudates and weeds respectively in detail 7 cs 0 1 yield hi 0 45 8 cr yield hi s r 0 45 9 ce 0 09 yield hi 0 45 10 cw 0 07 yield hi 0 45 applying eq 6 ctot was 5 62 t c t ha 1 in good agreement with the average value of jhum sites obtained by the calibration of rothc 5 82 t c t ha 1 3 2 model validation following the equilibrium simulations in the forest sites we simulated the conversion to jhum land use and rothc results were validated using the three indicators of model performance previously described see materials and methods section the agreement between measured and simulated data was quite good since r2 rmse and ef were 0 989 0 029 and 0 999 respectively and the standard deviation of the measured values was also higher than rmse with a value of 11 45 based on these results we can affirm that rothc predictions are fully acceptable for the purpose of this modeling exercise and can be used to simulate soc stock changes under the baseline and climate change conditions as described in the following section 3 3 simulated carbon stock changes under the baseline climatic conditions and compared to the equilibrium simulated values for forest sites fig 4a average soc stocks during the five years of simulation after samplings decreased by 0 22 t c ha 1 and the yearly change was 0 04 t c ha 1 yr 1 when compared to the calibrated values for jhum sites average soc stocks for jhum land use in the same period decreased by 2 00 t c ha 1 and the yearly change was 0 40 t c ha 1 yr 1 fig 4a the analogous simulations results under the projected climate change projections for a period of 5 years fig 4b showed an average soc stocks change of 1 03 t c ha 1 in forest sites and the average yearly change was 0 21 t c ha 1 yr 1 conversely soc stocks decreased by 2 51 t c ha 1 in jhum sites with a yearly decrease equal to 0 50 t c ha 1 yr 1as average yearly soc changes in forest and jhum sites during a period of 10 years under climate change conditions were interpolated by a polynomial equation fig 5 to evaluate the effect on soc stocks following a possible extension of the jhum cropping cycle for a longer time of period results indicated an average yearly soc decrease in jhum sites equal to 0 43 t c ha 1 yr 1 lower than the average decrease during the 5 years simulation 0 50 t c ha 1 yr 1 in detail soc decrease was inversely related to the duration of the cropping cycle almost linear in the first five years from 0 65 to 0 41 t c ha 1 yr 1 and thereafter was only slightly decreasing from 0 39 to 0 32 t c ha 1 yr 1 at the same time soc change in forest sites was 0 14 t c ha 1 yr 1 as average lower than the average change during the 5 years simulation 0 21 t c ha 1 yr 1 analogously to jhum sites soc change was almost linearly declining in the first five years in forest sites from 0 36 to 0 11 t c ha 1 yr 1 and thereafter was slightly declining from 0 09 to 0 06 t c ha 1 yr 1 considering the total area of jhum fields in dimapur and kohima districts 13 220 ha yearly and total soc loss during jhum cropping cycle were more pronounced from year 1 to 5 of cultivation and equal to 3225 t c yr 1 and 25 kt c respectively fig 6a from year 6 to 10 yearly soc losses decreased to 897 t c yr 1 and total soc losses to 18 kt c fig 6b 4 discussion forest sites under the baseline climate showed slightly negative soc stocks changes indicating a steady state condition and thus can be considered sustainable in the humid subtropical climate conditions of dimapur and kohima districts of nagaland state in addition model simulations showed a decreasing trend of soc stocks under the projected climate change conditions for forest sites indicating that this land use could not benefit from climate change due to temperature and precipitation effects in a long term perspective for example if simulations would be projected to longer periods e g 30 years in detail soc stocks would change by about 1 2 t c ha 1during five years compared to the baseline conditions 1 03 vs 0 22 t c ha 1 with a yearly change equal 0 25 t c ha 1 yr 1 0 21 vs 0 04 t c ha 1 yr 1 jhum sites showed negative changes in soc stocks during the five years of simulation both under the baseline and under the projected climate change conditions but in the latter case the further decrease was equal to 0 51 t c ha 1 2 00 vs 2 51 t c ha 1 with an additional slight yearly decrease of 0 10 t c ha 1 yr 1 for jhum sites simulated yearly and total soc losses were higher from year 1 to 5 37 4 and 5 4 respectively compared to year 6 to 10 17 6 and 4 3 respectively again showing that soc decreases could be substantially higher when jhum cycle was shorter beyond all inherent uncertainties in the use of simulation models we did not know how many jhum cycles took place after the shifting from forest in the selected sites before soil samplings other uncertainties could derive from climate change projections since in rothc soc decomposition rates are governed by plant carbon inputs and are nonlinear functions of temperature and soil moisture patterns coleman and jenkinson 2014 thus climate has a primary influence on predicted soil carbon trends in this study both temperature and precipitations increased under climate change but giorgi and lionello 2008 indicated that precipitation projections are less robust than those of temperature since precipitation involves local processes of more considerable complexity than temperature nevertheless the simulated effects on soc dynamics are quite reasonable as already mentioned in the introduction section no simulation studies are available for soc dynamics in shifting cultivation thus we can only compare the measured soc stocks with similar findings in the same area choudhury et al 2016 studied soc stocks in neh region under different land uses including shifting cultivation presently cultivated for different durations 2 8 years results were in good agreement with our findings and indicated a significant lower soc stock in jhum 27 4 t c ha 1 compared with the dense forest land use 35 2 t c ha 1 but not significant in comparison with the open forest sites 30 1 t c ha 1 shifting cultivation showed about 22 less soc stock than the dense forests but only 9 less that the open forests mishra et al 2017 assessed soil quality under shifting cultivation and forest sites in wokha district of nagaland neh and average soc stocks were 17 2 lower in jhum 46 9 t c ha 1 than in forest sites 56 6 t c ha 1 according to kumar et al 2016a the reduced cropping cycle is among the main constraints leading to a decline in the productivity and profitability of jhum fields mainly because of the population increase and consequent increase in the demand for food while the earlier cycle was 10 15 years the present length is not enough to restore the functional capacity of soils after the initial forest clearing and burning in the early stages of plantations in addition shifting cultivation practices deteriorate soil fertility due to high soil losses by erosion and a minimum period of 10 15 years would be essential to maintain the soil fertility for sustainable crop production anyhow farmers harvest the crops by cutting or picking the economically important part for instance paddy panicle or maize cob leaving the crop residues on the slope of the hills which can help to protect the soil from erosion as well as enhance fertility after the decomposition kuotsuo et al 2014 kumar et al 2016b also reported that short jhum cycles 5 years have lower fertility than those with longer cycles indeed during the first year of jhum cultivation soil may have a better nutrient status which can be lost in the following years due to leaching and runoff from sloping fields mishra et al 2017 further constraints in jhum agriculture are water scarcity during the post monsoon winter seasons lack of awareness about improved agriculture technologies and vegetable cultivation and mono cropping with traditional practices and management different scientific interventions in soil water and nutrient conservation and crops can be undertaken to address these constraints kumar et al 2016a terracing of existing jhum land for wet rice based farming systems increasing of cropping intensity by introducing short duration crops after rice fallow introduction of high yielding crops varieties and adoption of improved agro techniques restoration of degraded jhum lands through agroforestry based farming systems water harvesting techniques for multiple purpose uses and horticulture based farming systems 5 conclusions according to the nagaland state action plan on climate change 2012 jhum land intensification and extension of cropping cycle is one of the key programs of research in agriculture to be addressed by adopting improved farming practices and fallow management systems so that productivity in jhum areas would increase in the present study the rothc model was parameterized on measured soc contents of forest and jhum sites thereafter was used to simulate the dynamics of soc under climate change conditions for a period of ten years and results showed that the jhum cropping cycle can be extended for a longer period without substantial effects on soc decreases this target could be matched provided that jhum lands are properly managed through cultivating the jhum for longer periods and managing the fallow period length conversion of further forests to jhum agriculture is not acceptable due to the soil degradation deriving from erosion and nutrient loss through runoff for this reason we recommend that further research in agriculture would be coupled with soil water and nutrient conservation measures as well as crop management practices with the aim to store more c in soil and improve soil quality in jhum fields acknowledgements we greatly acknowledge the financial support from the indian council of forestry research and education we wish to thank the forest department of
