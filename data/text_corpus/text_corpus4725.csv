introduction ocean contains abundant resources including the renewable energies which have not been exploited sufficiently by human beings wave energy has experienced a rapid development in the last few decades overtopping wave energy converter owec is one of the most promising technologies and it is capable of converting the unstable wave energy into the relatively stable potential energy by storing the wave water in a reservoir higher than the surrounding sea level the incident waves could climb along the sloping ramp and overtop into the reservoir as the stored water is released in the outflow tube it could drive the low head axial turbine to generate the electricity in the north of china due to the small wave heights and the large tidal range the energy converting performance of a single level owec is poor especially at the lower sea level the design of multi level reservoirs may be a solution to improve the overtopping discharges under the condition of a large tidal range on the other hand wave energy devices also encounter challenges such as low reliability and high construction and maintenance costs the integration of wave energy converters with traditional coastal or offshore structures is an alternative to reduce wave energy conversion costs significantly sloping breakwaters incorporate ramps which can be modified to construct the smooth sloping walls of owecs to

detailed prediction of wave overtopping behaviors in addition the desktop work of numerical simulations can significantly reduce research costs when compared to laboratory tests to the limit of our literature review the numerical study on the overtopping performance of owec is in the preliminary stage and has scope for further enhancement in this study a numerical wave tank nwt established in the commercial cfd software ansys fluent 12 0 was applied for the overtopping performance prediction of the mobrec wave behaviors over the multi stage sloping walls are compared with the laboratory results the variation of water level in the reservoir and time averaged overtopping discharges are also validated by the experimental data effects of several shape parameters including the sloping angles of the reservoirs opening width of the lower reservoir and the gap height between the reservoirs on the dimensionless overtopping discharges of the reservoirs were investigated in the 2d nwt 2 numerical model 2 1 conceptual design of mobrec the conceptual design of the mobrec is shown in fig 1 the device contains an upper reservoir ur and a lower reservoir lr which share a common sloping ramp the geometry of the mobrec is simplified to maintain the primary shape characteristics as well as for the convenience of geometry and grid s generation in the numerical model the total height of the device h t is the sum of the height of the lower sloping wall lsw h l height of the upper sloping wall usw h u and the gap height between two reservoirs h g the sloping angles for the lsw and usw are α and β respectively the opening width of the lower reservoir lr is o l l represents the total length of the device furthermore w ur and w lr represent the widths of the ur and lr respectively d represents the still water depth and the crest freeboards of ur and lr are defined as r cu and r cl respectively 2 2 numerical model set up 2 2 1 governing equations a 2d numerical wave tank is utilized for the subsequent investigations the nwt is established by using the commercial cfd software ansys fluent 12 0 the fluids in the numerical model are assumed to be incompressible and viscous the governing equations are the continuity equation and the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν ν t u i x j u j x i x j u i u j where u i is the velocity component averaged over time t p is the fluid pressure ρ is the fluid density and ν is the kinetic viscosity the additional terms appear to represent the effects of turbulence the term u i u j represents reynolds stresses ν t is the eddy viscosity and can be defined as ν t c μ k 2 ε k is the turbulence kinetic energy and its rate of dissipation is ε c μ is a constant and is set as 0 0845 in addition the standard k ε model is used to enclose the aforementioned equations and address the turbulence effects in the simulations the two phase vof model is employed for tracking free water surface to include the complex wave motions such as the breaking and overtopping 2 2 2 computational domain and boundary conditions the computational domain is illustrated in fig 2 the wave making plate and the mobrec are set at two opposite sides of the nwt these two parts and the bottom are defined as the no slip wall boundary the standard wall function is used for near wall treatment the pressure outlet condition is considered for the top boundary which is adjacent to the air phase the length of the nwt is at least 10 times of incident wave length for full development of propagating waves and guarantees the reflecting waves not to arrive the wave making plate before the end of calculations the height of the nwt is determined by that of the mobrec model during the validation of desired wave conditions a sponge damping zone with the width of two times of incident wave length at the position of mobrec it is used to absorb incident waves by using the momentum source method liu et al 2011 2 2 3 numerical solutions for the discretization of the governing equations the finite volume method is employed in the pressure based solver the piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators algorithm is used for pressure velocity coupling the lscb least squares cell based and bfw body force weighted algorithms are employed for the gradient and pressure interpolations respectively the nita non iterative time advancement scheme is coupled with the piso algorithm for time discretization to accelerate the iterations and reduce the computation time significantly in the transient calculations compared to the irregular waves employed in previous studies to investigate the effects of wave climate regular waves are employed in this study to more clearly demonstrate their individual motion behaviors on the device and their overtopping discharge performance which will provide valuable information to the further design of mobrec the regular waves are generated by the piston motion of the wave making plate which are achieved by employing the udf user defined function define cg motion to define the oscillating amplitude and period of the plate the wave absorption is realized by using the udf define source to incorporate the dissipation terms in the momentum equations the hybrid initialization method is used for the computation initialization which could conduct the pre iteration of governing equations and has a better convergence following the previous studies the grid size δx in the x horizontal direction is maintained less than 1 50 of the incident wave length furthermore the grid size δy in the y vertical direction around the free surface and over the lsw and usw are refined to be less than 1 500 of the incident wave length the time step is set to be 1 200 of the incident wave period which can guarantee the time step independency on the accuracy of the wave train other detailed validations of the nwt could be found in the previous studies liu et al 2011 2010 2016 3 numerical model validation although the nwt and its application in other type of wave energy converting technologies has been validated its capability for predicting the wave behaviors on overtopping devices and overtopping discharges into the reservoir should be verified prior to subsequent studies an experiment of the multi level overtopping device conducted under regular wave conditions in the flume of ocean university of china is utilized for the validation liu et al the experimental model has a primary geometry identical to that of the mobrec the corresponding parameters include h l 0 35 m h g 0 h u 0 1 m thus h t 0 45 m α 30 β 30 o l 0 1 m w lr 0 2 m l 1 08 m and d 0 3 m the model was made by the acryl plates and the water surface elevation was measured by the water depth gauges installed in the reservoirs 3 1 validation of overtopping process snapshot comparisons of the overtopping process in a wave cycle between the numerical prediction and experimental test are shown in fig 3 the incident wave height is h 0 05 m and the wave period is t 1 0 s at t t 4 the wave water hunches by the blocking effects of the sloping wall which can be observed both in the numerical and experimental tests at t t 2 in the experimental test the breaking can be observed at the water tongue when it arrives at the opening of the reservoir although it is challenging to obtain the details of wave breaking at the water tongue from the simulation results the profile of the water surface at this instant is adequately predicted at t 3t 4 the overtopped wave waters could be both found in two sub figures at t t the numerical free surface during the wave retreat is marginally higher than that in the experimental test the water level variation in the reservoir owing to the accumulation of the overtopping waves is also compared between the numerical prediction and experimental test of the above case as shown in fig 4 the counting time begins when the first wave makes to overtop into the reservoir the end time of wave making in the numerical simulation also follows the experimental test seventeen waves overtop into the reservoir it can be observed that the fluctuation of the numerical free surface is tougher than that in the experimental model at the initial stage it can be attributed to the fact that the presence of water level gauges in the experiment exerts a calming effect on the water body sloshing in the latter stage the ascension of the numerical surface is marginally slower than that in the experimental process after the wave making is shut down two calming processes are consistent to a significant degree 3 2 validation of overtopping discharges the overtopping discharge of the reservoir is a key parameter to evaluate the energy conversion capability of the mobrec the dimensionless overtopping discharges for the lr and ur are defined as q l and q u which can be used for the comparison between the experimental data and numerical predictions kobayashi and wurijanto 1989 the definition of q l and q u are written as follows 3 q l q l h g h q u q u h g h where g is the acceleration of gravity q l and q u are the time averaged overtopping discharges per meter for the lr and ur respectively their unit is m3 s m q l and q u can be simply calculated from the water volume in the reservoir and the filling time which is counted from the first wave s entry into the reservoir the detailed measuring and calculating method can be found in the previous studies liu et al 2017 liu et al for the comparison the incident wave height h is fixed at 0 05 m and the wave period t varies from 1 0 s 1 2 s 1 4 s the numerical and experimental values of q l against the length ratio λ l are shown in fig 5 where λ is the wave length the numerical model successfully predicts the decreasing tendency of q l with the increase in the length ratio furthermore the average error of the numerical results when compared to the experimental data is 3 8 the present numerical model has demonstrated its adequate capability of performance prediction of overtopping wec in the 2d cases 4 results and discussion 4 1 effects of the opening width of lr on the overtopping discharges of ur the test run series for various values of o l are listed in table 1 the device length l varies with the variation of o l the incident wave height varies between 0 04 m 0 06 m and 0 08 m and the wave period varies from 1 4 s 1 6 s 1 8 s 2 0 s therefore 12 series of incident wave conditions are employed in this section with a still water depth of d 0 4 m the lr is submerged and only the overtopping discharges of ur are recorded and analyzed effects of the opening width of the lr on the overtopping discharges of ur under various relative wave heights of the ur are presented in fig 6 three values of h r cu are used for comparison 0 8 1 2 and 1 6 the dimensionless overtopping discharges q u for various width ratios d o l are compared with the length ratio λ l which is used to demonstrate the effects of incident wave period for h r cu 0 8 in fig 6 a the value of q u for d o l 2 67 increases with the increase in the length ratio for the other two values of the width ratio the values of q u first increase and subsequently decrease in the domain of the length ratio in addition a larger width ratio exhibits a higher performance in the dimensionless overtopping discharges the average values of q u for d o l 8 0 and d o l 4 0 are 88 and 71 larger respectively than those for d o l 2 67 for h r cu 1 2 in fig 6 b the overtopping discharges increase and vary from 4 4 10 2 to 8 4 10 2 the variation of q u for various width ratios exhibits a tendency similar to those shown in fig 6 a the averaged values of q u for the highest value of d o l are 14 1 and 37 0 larger than those for the other two width ratios for h r cu 1 6 in fig 6 c the variation of overtopping discharges among three width ratios becomes less noticeable the values of q u also increase marginally with the increase in the length ratio and vary from 4 5 10 2 to 7 2 10 2 the average values of q u for d o l 8 0 are 6 5 and 15 3 larger than those for the other two width ratios the results indicate that a larger open width of the lr exerts more significant berm effects which causes more wave breaking and energy loss during the water climbing on the usw particularly for the smaller wave heights the largest width ratio exhibits the highest performance of overtopping wave water accumulation in the ur this advantage decreases as the relative wave height becomes adequately large 4 2 effects of the sloping angles on the overtopping discharges of ur the shape parameters of the mobrec hereby include the following d 0 4 m h l 0 35 m h g 0 and h u 0 1 m and thus r cu 0 05 m the incident wave conditions are same as those described in the previous section for the study of the lower sloping angle α the upper sloping angle β is fixed as 30 the test run series for various values of α are listed in table 2 effects of the lower sloping angle α on the dimensionless overtopping discharges of ur are presented in fig 7 for the smallest relative wave height in fig 7 a the values of q u for all the lower sloping angles exhibit a peak over the domain of length ratio which vary from 3 1 10 2 to 5 7 10 2 for h r cu 1 2 in fig 7 b the dimensionless overtopping discharges for the smaller lower sloping angles exhibits a similar tendency as that observed in fig 7 a for larger values of α apart from a jump point at α 40 the values of q u exhibit negligible variation over the domain of length ratio for h r cu 1 6 in fig 7 c the values of q u for each lower sloping angles increase gradually at various sub domains of length ratio q u only varies from 4 2 10 2 to 6 6 10 2 from the above results it can be concluded that a milder underwater slope exhibits negligible wave uplifting effects for the incident waves with larger heights for smaller wave heights the steeper underwater slope causes a decrease in q u for the larger wave length because of the energy loss during wave propagation the locations of the discharge curves indicate that the steeper underwater slope causes the overtopping that occurs at the domain of larger length ratios generally the lower sloping angle exhibits the highest overtopping performance at α 30 effects of the upper sloping angle β on the dimensionless overtopping discharges of ur are shown in fig 8 where the lower sloping angle α is fixed at 30 the test run series for various values of β are listed in table 3 for h r cu 0 8 in fig 8 a the dimensionless overtopping discharge varies from 3 0 10 2 to 5 7 10 2 in addition the value of β 30 causes a larger overtopping discharge particularly for the larger length ratios it indicates that a small upper sloping angle enlarges the wave climbing path of usw and the steeper upper slope causes more energy losses including the wave breakings for h r cu 1 2 in fig 8 b the values of q u for β 30 are larger than those for the other two angles in the lower length ratio domain the values of q u for β 40 exhibit negligible variation from that for β 30 which are both larger than that for β 20 for the largest relative wave height in fig 8 c the variations among the values of q u for three upper sloping angles are relatively small in fig 8 c q u varies from 4 8 10 2 to 6 6 10 2 the results indicate that the upper sloping angle exerts marginal effect on the overtopping discharges for the larger incident wave height 4 3 effects of the gap height on the overtopping discharges in this section the total height of the mobrec h t is fixed at 0 9 m both sloping angles are 30 the heights of two reservoirs sloping walls are set equal the height ratio is defined as γ h g h t and the test run series for various values of γ are listed in table 4 the incident wave condition is fixed as the wave height of h 0 08 m and wave period of t 1 4 s for the study of q u the water depth d is set at 0 75 m and thus the crest freeboard r cu is 0 15 m two opening widths of the lr are set as o l 0 1 m and o l 0 3 m effects of the height ratio on the dimensionless overtopping discharges of ur for two values of d o l are given in fig 9 for d o l 7 5 the value of q u decreases significantly from 10 5 10 2 to 0 7 10 2 as the height ratio increases for a smaller d o l the amplitudes of q u are relatively small and the variation of q u is also small these results indicate that the effects of the gap height on the overtopping discharges are evident only when the opening width of lr is small because the climbing path on the usw is extended significantly the lr is exposed as the water depth is set at 0 3 m therefore the crest freeboards of lr r cl with the variation of the height ratio γ are 0 15 m 0 1 m and 0 05 m effects of the height ratio on the dimensionless overtopping discharges q l are presented in fig 10 the values of q l for three width ratios all increase with the increase of the height ratio for γ 0 the overtopping discharges are substantially small because of the larger value of r cl furthermore the values of q l for two smaller width ratios are approximately equal to the variation of γ which are over 50 higher than that for d o l 6 0 as γ 0 222 5 conclusions and future works a 2d numerical wave tank was established based on the vof model by using the commercial cfd software ansys fluent 12 0 which was used to investigate the overtopping performance of the mobrec regular waves were employed in all numerical cases to demonstrate the wave overtopping process and discharge of the individual wave conditions more clearly which will provide more valuable information to the advanced design of mobrec in the future the numerical prediction of the overtopping process free surface elevation in the reservoir and the time averaged overtopping discharges are validated by the corresponding experimental tests it was found that a larger opening width of lr exerts more significant berm effects particularly for the smaller wave height conditions the sloping angles of α 30 and β 30 exhibited the highest performance of the dimensionless overtopping discharges the gap height of the device exerts significant effects only when the opening width of lr is adequately small the dimensionless overtopping discharges of the lower reservoir increase with the increase of the height ratio in future works the 3d numerical wave tank is intended to be established to study other shape parameters of the mobrec more detailed hydrodynamic information is intended to be provided including those on the 3d wave run up overtopping and breaking with energy loss analysis irregular wave conditions reflecting the local wave climate in north china will also be employed for the practical design of the mobrec acknowledgement the research is part of a project completely supported by the key basic

their individual motion behaviors on the device and their overtopping discharge performance which will provide valuable information to the further design of mobrec the regular waves are generated by the piston motion of the wave making plate which are achieved by employing the udf user defined function define cg motion to define the oscillating amplitude and period of the plate the wave absorption is realized by using the udf define source to incorporate the dissipation terms in the momentum equations the hybrid initialization method is used for the computation initialization which could conduct the pre iteration of governing equations and has a better convergence following the previous studies the grid size δx in the x horizontal direction is maintained less than 1 50 of the incident wave length furthermore the grid size δy in the y vertical direction around the free surface and over the lsw and usw are refined to be less than 1 500 of the incident wave length the time step is set to be 1 200 of the incident wave period which can guarantee the time step independency on the accuracy of the wave train other detailed validations of the nwt could be found in the previous studies liu et al 2011 2010 2016 3 numerical model validation although the nwt and its application in other type of wave energy converting technologies has been validated its capability for predicting the wave behaviors on overtopping devices and overtopping discharges into the reservoir should be verified prior to subsequent studies an experiment of the multi level overtopping device conducted under regular wave conditions in the flume of ocean university of china is utilized for the validation liu et al the experimental model has a primary geometry identical to that of the mobrec the corresponding parameters include h l 0 35 m h g 0 h u 0 1 m thus h t 0 45 m α 30 β 30 o l 0 1 m w lr 0 2 m l 1 08 m and d 0 3 m the model was made by the acryl plates and the water surface elevation was measured by the water depth gauges installed in the reservoirs 3 1 validation of overtopping process snapshot comparisons of the overtopping process in a wave cycle between the numerical prediction and experimental test are shown in fig 3 the incident wave height is h 0 05 m and the wave period is t 1 0 s at t t 4 the wave water hunches by the blocking effects of the sloping wall which can be observed both in the numerical and experimental tests at t t 2 in the experimental test the breaking can be observed at the water tongue when it arrives at the opening of the reservoir although it is challenging to obtain the details of wave breaking at the water tongue from the simulation results the profile of the water surface at this instant is adequately predicted at t 3t 4 the overtopped wave waters could be both found in two sub figures at t t the numerical free surface during the wave retreat is marginally higher than that in the experimental test the water level variation in the reservoir owing to the accumulation of the overtopping waves is also compared between the numerical prediction and experimental test of the above case as shown in fig 4 the counting time begins when the first wave makes to overtop into the reservoir the end time of wave making in the numerical simulation also follows the experimental test seventeen waves overtop into the reservoir it can be observed that the fluctuation of the numerical free surface is tougher than that in the experimental model at the initial stage it can be attributed to the fact that the presence of water level gauges in the experiment exerts a calming effect on the water body sloshing in the latter stage the ascension of the numerical surface is marginally slower than that in the experimental process after the wave making is shut down two calming processes are consistent to a significant degree 3 2 validation of overtopping discharges the overtopping discharge of the reservoir is a key parameter to evaluate the energy conversion capability of the mobrec the dimensionless overtopping discharges for the lr and ur are defined as q l and q u which can be used for the comparison between the experimental data and numerical predictions kobayashi and wurijanto 1989 the definition of q l and q u are written as follows 3 q l q l h g h q u q u h g h where g is the acceleration of gravity q l and q u are the time averaged overtopping discharges per meter for the lr and ur respectively their unit is m3 s m q l and q u can be simply calculated from the water volume in the reservoir and the filling time which is counted from the first wave s entry into the reservoir the detailed measuring and calculating method can be found in the previous studies liu et al 2017 liu et al for the comparison the incident wave height h is fixed at 0 05 m and the wave period t varies from 1 0 s 1 2 s 1 4 s the numerical and experimental values of q l against the length ratio λ l are shown in fig 5 where λ is the wave length the numerical model successfully predicts the decreasing tendency of q l with the increase in the length ratio furthermore the average error of the numerical results when compared to the experimental data is 3 8 the present numerical model has demonstrated its adequate capability of performance prediction of overtopping wec in the 2d cases 4 results and discussion 4 1 effects of the opening width of lr on the overtopping discharges of ur the test run series for various values of o l are listed in table 1 the device length l varies with the variation of o l the incident wave height varies between 0 04 m 0 06 m and 0 08 m and the wave period varies from 1 4 s 1 6 s 1 8 s 2 0 s therefore 12 series of incident wave conditions are employed in this section with a still water depth of d 0 4 m the lr is submerged and only the overtopping discharges of ur are recorded and analyzed effects of the opening width of the lr on the overtopping discharges of ur under various relative wave heights of the ur are presented in fig 6 three values of h r cu are used for comparison 0 8 1 2 and 1 6 the dimensionless overtopping discharges q u for various width ratios d o l are compared with the length ratio λ l which is used to demonstrate the effects of incident wave period for h r cu 0 8 in fig 6 a the value of q u for d o l 2 67 increases with the increase in the length ratio for the other two values of the width ratio the values of q u first increase and subsequently decrease in the domain of the length ratio in addition a larger width ratio exhibits a higher performance in the dimensionless overtopping discharges the average values of q u for d o l 8 0 and d o l 4 0 are 88 and 71 larger respectively than those for d o l 2 67 for h r cu 1 2 in fig 6 b the overtopping discharges increase and vary from 4 4 10 2 to 8 4 10 2 the variation of q u for various width ratios exhibits a tendency similar to those shown in fig 6 a the averaged values of q u for the highest value of d o l are 14 1 and 37 0 larger than those for the other two width ratios for h r cu 1 6 in fig 6 c the variation of overtopping discharges among three width ratios becomes less noticeable the values of q u also increase marginally with the increase in the length ratio and vary from 4 5 10 2 to 7 2 10 2 the average values of q u for d o l 8 0 are 6 5 and 15 3 larger than those for the other two width ratios the results indicate that a larger open width of the lr exerts more significant berm effects which causes more wave breaking and energy loss during the water climbing on the usw particularly for the smaller wave heights the largest width ratio exhibits the highest performance of overtopping wave water accumulation in the ur this advantage decreases as the relative wave height becomes adequately large 4 2 effects of the sloping angles on the overtopping discharges of ur the shape parameters of the mobrec hereby include the following d 0 4 m h l 0 35 m h g 0 and h u 0 1 m and thus r cu 0 05 m the incident wave conditions are same as those described in the previous section for the study of the lower sloping angle α the upper sloping angle β is fixed as 30 the test run series for various values of α are listed in table 2 effects of the lower sloping angle α on the dimensionless overtopping discharges of ur are presented in fig 7 for the smallest relative wave height in fig 7 a the values of q u for all the lower sloping angles exhibit a peak over the domain of length ratio which vary from 3 1 10 2 to 5 7 10 2 for h r cu 1 2 in fig 7 b the dimensionless overtopping discharges for the smaller lower sloping angles exhibits a similar tendency as that observed in fig 7 a for larger values of α apart from a jump point at α 40 the values of q u exhibit negligible variation over the domain of length ratio for h r cu 1 6 in fig 7 c the values of q u for each lower sloping angles increase gradually at various sub domains of length ratio q u only varies from 4 2 10 2 to 6 6 10 2 from the above results it can be concluded that a milder underwater slope exhibits negligible wave uplifting effects for the incident waves with larger heights for smaller wave heights the steeper underwater slope causes a decrease in q u for the larger wave length because of the energy loss during wave propagation the locations of the discharge curves indicate that the steeper underwater slope causes the overtopping that occurs at the domain of larger length ratios generally the lower sloping angle exhibits the highest overtopping performance at α 30 effects of the upper sloping angle β on the dimensionless overtopping discharges of ur are shown in fig 8 where the lower sloping angle α is fixed at 30 the test run series for various values of β are listed in table 3 for h r cu 0 8 in fig 8 a the dimensionless overtopping discharge varies from 3 0 10 2 to 5 7 10 2 in addition the value of β 30 causes a larger overtopping discharge particularly for the larger length ratios it indicates that a small upper sloping angle enlarges the wave climbing path of usw and the steeper upper slope causes more energy losses including the wave breakings for h r cu 1 2 in fig 8 b the values of q u for β 30 are larger than those for the other two angles in the lower length ratio domain the values of q u for β 40 exhibit negligible variation from that for β 30 which are both larger than that for β 20 for the largest relative wave height in fig 8 c the variations among the values of q u for three upper sloping angles are relatively small in fig 8 c q u varies from 4 8 10 2 to 6 6 10 2 the results indicate that the upper sloping angle exerts marginal effect on the overtopping discharges for the larger incident wave height 4 3 effects of the gap height on the overtopping discharges in this section the total height of the mobrec h t is fixed at 0 9 m both sloping angles are 30 the heights of two reservoirs sloping walls are set equal the height ratio is defined as γ h g h t and the test run series for various values of γ are listed in table 4 the incident wave condition is fixed as the wave height of h 0 08 m and wave period of t 1 4 s for the study of q u the water depth d is set at 0 75 m and thus the crest freeboard r cu is 0 15 m two opening widths of the lr are set as o l 0 1 m and o l 0 3 m effects of the height ratio on the dimensionless overtopping discharges of ur for two values of d o l are given in fig 9 for d o l 7 5 the value of q u decreases significantly from 10 5 10 2 to 0 7 10 2 as the height ratio increases for a smaller d o l the amplitudes of q u are relatively small and the variation of q u is also small these results indicate that the effects of the gap height on the overtopping discharges are evident only when the opening width of lr is small because the climbing path on the usw is extended significantly the lr is exposed as the water depth is set at 0 3 m therefore the crest freeboards of lr r cl with the variation of the height ratio γ are 0 15 m 0 1 m and 0 05 m effects of the height ratio on the dimensionless overtopping discharges q l are presented in fig 10 the values of q l for three width ratios all increase with the increase of the height ratio for γ 0 the overtopping discharges are substantially small because of the larger value of r cl furthermore the values of q l for two smaller width ratios are approximately equal to the variation of γ which are over 50 higher than that for d o l 6 0 as γ 0 222 5 conclusions and future works a 2d numerical wave tank was established based on the vof model by using the commercial cfd software ansys fluent 12 0 which was used to investigate the overtopping performance of the mobrec regular waves were employed in all numerical cases to demonstrate the wave overtopping process and discharge of the individual wave conditions more clearly which will provide more valuable information to the advanced design of mobrec in the future the numerical prediction of the overtopping process free surface elevation in the reservoir and the time averaged overtopping discharges are validated by the corresponding experimental tests it was found that a larger opening width of lr exerts more significant berm effects particularly for the smaller wave height conditions the sloping angles of α 30 and β 30 exhibited the highest performance of the dimensionless overtopping discharges the gap height of the device exerts significant effects only when the opening width of lr is adequately small the dimensionless overtopping discharges of the lower reservoir increase with the increase of the height ratio in future works the 3d numerical wave tank is intended to be established to study other shape parameters of the mobrec more detailed hydrodynamic information is intended to be provided including those on the 3d wave run up overtopping and breaking with energy loss analysis irregular wave conditions reflecting the local wave climate in north china will also be employed for the practical design of the mobrec acknowledgement the research is part of a project completely supported by the key basic

23626,this paper reports on numerical simulations conducted on an underwater vehicle for six degrees of freedom 6 dof free running manoeuvres using computational fluid dynamics cfd the cfd manoeuvring trials straight line and steady turning manoeuvres were conducted using a model scaled bb2 submarine with movable control planes and a body force propeller represented by an actuator disk incorporating predetermined propulsion properties the propulsion properties were obtained from captive self propulsion simulation adopting the actual bb2 propeller the free running simulations were validated against experimental data the results showed that the 6 dof cfd simulations are capable of predicting the bb2 manoeuvring characteristics with good agreement against the experimental data the 6 dof manoeuvring simulations carried out allow for the unsteady viscosity effects which is usually a limitation of the traditional coefficient based prediction method the simulations will enable accurate determination of the vehicle s manoeuvring characteristics which are essential for the control system design and its safe operating envelope keywords computational fluid dynamics underwater vehicles free running model 6 degrees of freedom manoeuvring simulation movable control planes 1 introduction underwater vehicles require control systems that can adjust the control planes of the vehicle in order to carry out course changes and maintain its intended course during a mission the control signals directed to the various control planes are influenced by the vehicle s manoeuvring characteristics thus an accurate determination of the manoeuvring characteristics is essential to ensure that the control system of the vehicle is adequately designed to maintain its desired trajectory for each manoeuvre during a mission or operation the manoeuvring characteristics can be examined using numerical techniques experimental programmes or a combination of both the former includes two approaches i e coefficient based or physics based methods the coefficient based method uses a mathematical model that implements motion equations gertler and hagen 1967 feldman 1979 incorporating hydrodynamic coefficients this method is usually adopted because of its rapid simulation time with predefined constant coefficients however it is limited in its capability to carry out accurate manoeuvring predictions owing to its inability to capture unsteady viscous effects specifically cross flow and vorticity bettle 2013 to overcome these limitations and increase accuracy in the determination of manoeuvring characteristics the physics based method is proposed in this study this involves a free running test of a vehicle moving in response to its control planes propeller and the environment see fig 1 in the past free running tests of underwater vehicles have often been carried out experimentally using physical models operated in controlled environments itard 1999 issac et al 2007 jun et al 2009 and overpelt et al 2015 however they have limitations due to cost and the need for specialised equipment and facilities with increasing capabilities in computational fluid dynamics cfd and high performance computing hpc cfd based free running tests are becoming more affordable and well suited to supplement experimental studies although validation may yet require experimental results chase 2012 conducted a 1 dof degrees of freedom free running cfd simulation of the fully appended suboff groves et al 1989 generic submarine hull with fixed control planes and a rotating propeller the cfd results were validated against experimental self propulsion test data with good agreement in terms of the propulsion properties i e thrust coefficient k t torque coefficient k q and propeller efficiency η at a vehicle speed of 1 75 m s however the work was limited to computing the vehicle s trajectory speeds and accelerations to 1dof due to the intensive computational cost involved with modelling a rotating propeller chase suggested replacing the rotating propeller with a body force propeller model that would significantly reduce the simulation time bettle 2013 developed a 6 dof submarine simulation that involved an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans solver coupled with the submarine equations of motion for the suboff generic submarine the hydrodynamic characteristics of the propeller and controls were represented by force vectors to reduce the computational cost of the model the capability of the bettle s model was evaluated for an emergency rising manoeuvre with the results compared against predictions from a coefficient based simulation the largest difference was found to be a 10 increase in pitch angle bettle attributed this discrepancy to the coefficient based model incorporating rotary hydrodynamic coefficients that were calculated using semi empirical methods as future work to verify the discrepancy bettle suggested the 6 dof urans simulations should include actual control planes and propeller and compared against free running experimental measurements if available coe 2013 developed a 6 dof cfd free running model for a general purpose auv gpauv the study involved urans simulations coupled with a 6 dof rigid body dynamics rbd model using the commercial cfd package star ccm the deflection of the control planes was realised by an overset grid technique in conjuction with a body force propeller the body force propeller involved an actuator disk which produces thrust based on the known propeller performance curves coe stated that the poor agreement in trajectories and velocities from the comparison of free running simulations against free running experimental measurements were not conclusive the poor agreement is mainly due to issues on the experimental trials involving unexplained static offset of rudders e g approximately four degrees offset during the zig zag manoeuvre another possible cause for the discrepancy was that the simulations ignored the d rings which were affixed to the hull to facilitate deployment and recovery of the vehicle coe suggested further work on additional free running experimental measurements for further validation of the cfd results for example performing a steady turning manoeuvre to provide additional insight into the sources of discrepancies between cfd and experimental results the aim of this study is to investigate cfd capabilities as a tool to conduct the 6 dof free running manoeuvring simulations of a fully appended underwater vehicle it extends upon the works by bettle 2013 and coe 2013 by adopting movable control planes and the actuator disk propeller in the 6 dof free running simulation using star ccm the 6 dof simulation is physics based and is able to describe the accelerations of the vehicle with respect to the forces and moments due to weight buoyancy and the hydrodynamic forces the actuator disk propeller is described using the propulsion characteristics obtained through the captive self propulsion test included in this study the credibility of the cfd free running simulation results was established through validation against experimental data provided by overpelt et al 2015 the latter experiments were conducted by marin at the seakeeping and manoeuvring basin smb in wageningen netherlands the basin filled with fresh water having a density of 1000 kg m3 the experimental data was given for full scale in salt water 1025 kg m3 which required scaling based on froude scaling laws with a model scale factor λ of 18 348 overpelt et al 2015 the aft control planes employed a x form configuration consisted of four control planes moving independently to control the horizontal and vertical motions of the vehicle the individual angle of the planes were commanded by an autopilot that used a proportional derivative pd controller with a coupled proportional and derivative control parameter for translations and rotations overpelt et al 2015 the cfd model and its methodology developed in this study can be used by underwater vehicle designers to carry out 6 dof manoeuvring simulations for various vehicle designs configurations and missions addressing the limitation of the coefficient based prediction in accounting for the non linear characteristics of the vehicle due to unsteady viscosity effects the 6 dof physics based simulation will enable the designers to accurately determine a vehicle s manoeuvring characteristics for control system design and its safe operational limits 2 methodology 2 1 investigation programme this study utilised the bb2 generic submarine geometry overpelt et al 2015 which represents a typical conventional ssk submarine the design was derived from hull form introduced by joubert 2006 and the bb2 hull has a full scale length of 70 2 m the bb2 submarine consists of a sail x configuration stern control planes and a hull with a casing on top this study employed the model scale bb2 geometry fig 2 based on froude scaling laws with a scale factor λ of 18 348 giving the model a length of 3 826 m the submarine motion is described through a 6 dof body coordinate frame of reference see fig 3 in which the origin o is located at the centre of gravity cg with the positive directions along the x y and z axes being forward starboard and vertically downwards respectively the motion variables are listed in table 1 the current cfd model ensures that the longitudinal centre of buoyancy lcb is placed at the same position as the longitudinal centre of gravity lcg and the vertical stability lever was set at 0 022 m with the cg below the centre of buoyancy cb this gives a vertical stability lever of 0 0057 l which replicated the physical model the details of the mass properties are presented in table 2 straight line and steady turning manoeuvres cfd free running tests were calculated at the same depth condition i e 2 5 m depth from the water surface in a 5 m deep test basin as the experimental fluid dynamics efd cases the straight line case involved three vehicle speeds 0 73 0 97 and 1 19 m s and the steady turning case involved two effective rudder angles 20 and 30 at a nominal speed of approximately 1 19 m s which is equivalent to a reynolds number re of 5 2 106 the depth and pitch were controlled by an autopilot to maintain the desired vehicle stability all cases adopted movable control planes in conjunction with a body force propeller using an actuator disk which mimicked the propeller propulsion properties obtained from a captive self propulsion test see section 2 3 1 note that sail planes were kept at zero degrees for all manoeuvres a summary of the simulation cases is given in table 3 validation was carried out against experimental measurements provided by overpelt et al 2015 the x stern configuration consisted of four control planes moving independently to maintain translational and rotational stability in 6 dof throughout the course of the manoeuvres the autopilot commanded effective rudder δ r and effective sternplane δ s angles with individual plane angles δ u p p o r t δ d o w n p o r t δ u p s t a r b o a r d and δ d o w n s t a r b o a r d calculated using equations 1 4 based on the right hand rule with the thumb pointing away from the body overpelt et al 2015 note that the maximum plane angle for each of the control planes was limited to 30 1 δ up port δ r δ s 2 δ up starboard δ r δ s 3 δ down starboard δ r δ s 4 δ down port δ r δ s thus the effective rudder and sternplane angles were be calculated as 5 δ r δ up port δ down port δ up starboard δ down starboard 4 6 δ s δ up port δ down port δ up starboard δ down starboard 4 the autopilot and feedback controller utilised a proportional derivative pd controller with associated proportional and differential control parameters for translations and rotations see table 4 as used in the experiment overpelt et al 2015 where e t e d e s i r e e c u r r e n t and d e t d t e t c u r r e n t e t p r e v i o u s t c u r r e n t t p r e v i o u s 2 2 numerical strategy 2 2 1 numerical settings the cfd simulations utilised urans with turbulence model using the elliptic blending reynolds stress model ebrsm coupled to 6 dof rbd kim et al 2015a the urans equations solved the flow field for prediction of the vehicle s hydrodynamics this was then applied to compute the vehicle s resulting motion using the rbd equations with linear and angular momentum solvers for translation and rotation of the vehicle defined as a rigid body with its mass properties as referred in table 2 all simulations in this study were performed under transient conditions to investigate the behaviour of the vehicle in the time domain the fresh water with the same density as measured during the experiments i e 1000 kg m3 was specified for the single phase fluid which was assumed to be incompressible and isothermic to minimise numerical diffusion a second order upwind scheme with a maximum of ten inner iteration loops for convergence per time step was employed in the simulations courant friedrichs lewy cfl numbers were maintained below 6 in the majority of the computational domain throughout the simulations 2 2 2 grid model the type and element size of the grid play an important role in the computation as these influence the convergence and accuracy of the simulated results this study used an unstructured hybrid polyhedral for its ability to represent the complex geometry without excessively dense grid and high time demand inflation layers consisting of polyhedral prisms were applied on the surface of the vehicle to capture its boundary layer the free running simulations are extremely sensitive to the grid resolution on the vehicle s geometry as inaccurate geometrical representation leads to errors in prediction of the vehicle s cb and forces and moments on the vehicle cd adapco 2015 thus it is important to ensure that grid resolution is sufficient to represent the geometry in this study the grid resolution error of the bb2 geometry was maintained at less than 0 02 2 3 free running simulation setup the free running simulation model involved the vehicle operating with movable control planes and a body force propeller the latter is described using the propeller performance characteristics i e k t k q and η that were obtained from the captive self propulsion simulation which was carried out using cfd and employing the propeller geometry used in the experiment overpelt et al 2015 2 3 1 captive self propulsion simulation model 2 3 1 1 model setup fig 4 a shows the grid for a captive self propulsion model with the local refinement on the aft control planes and the propeller tip leading and trailing edges and blade surface regions shown in fig 4 b and the actual experimental model propeller and the aft control planes shown in fig 4 c the grid size on the interface between the propeller and the surrounding fluid flow was prescribed to rotate one grid face per degree based on a maximum applied rotational speed employed during the experiments i e 266 rpm additional grid refinement was carried out on the far field region shown in fig 4 a as variation of the physical quantities in these regions would be comparatively high the total boundary layer thickness and its distribution was achieved through prescribing the first layer thickness reflected by the y value and were estimated based on the calculations presented previously by the authors kim et al 2015b the y values were less than 1 for the hull to adequately resolve the boundary layer and a minimum of 30 for the propeller to allow the first node from the adjacent hull surface to be placed in the log wall region for use with a wall function the boundary conditions applied were a velocity inlet forward of the vehicle with zero velocity pressure outlets at the sides around the vehicle pressure outlet at the boundary aft of the vehicle and no slip walls on the vehicle see fig 7 a 2 3 1 2 discretisation studies to confirm that the grid providing fluid prediction is independent of the grid discretisation resolution a grid dependence study was performed for the vehicle in the captive self propulsion condition the thrust and torque of the propeller and the force in the x direction on the hull were examined for a series of grid levels from coarse to very fine table 5 shows the percentage difference of each grid level compared to the finest grid at the maximum operating propeller revolution of 266 rpm and forward speed of 1 4 m s it is seen that at the fine grid level the predictions of thrust torque and x force were within 1 of the finest very fine grid investigated as a conservative measure the fine grid configuration was adopted for the captive self propulsion simulations the temporal discretisation was examined to ensure sufficient time resolution to capture the 3d transient flow fields around the propeller as well as the vehicle a time step dependence study was carried out at various time steps as shown in table 6 it also shows the percentage difference of the thrust torque and force x between the applied time step and the smallest time step 0 0005 s corresponding to 0 8 degrees of propeller rotation per time step for the propeller it is seen that at the 0 0015 s time step the thrust and torque predictions were within 1 of the smallest time step investigated for the hull a time step of 0 025 s or smaller resulted in the x force being predicted within 1 of the smallest time step as a conservative measure the time step of 0 0015 s was utilised for the self propulsion simulations 2 3 1 3 propeller performance characteristics the performance characteristics of the propeller were predicted from the captive self propulsion tests with a constant rotational speed of 266 rpm and varying freestream velocity at the inlet see fig 5 the advance coefficients j were computed based on the average velocities measured at a plane placed 0 136 m forward of the propeller origin see fig 7 the predicted performance properties were fed into the actuator disk employed in the free running simulations 2 3 2 6 dof free running simulation model the fine grid configuration shown in fig 6 was selected for the free running simulation model the separate grids for the background fluid domain and control planes were connected using the overset interface see fig 7 the additional grid refinement on the propeller wake region shown in fig 7 was prescribed for effective use of the actuator disk cd adapco 2015 the free running vehicle motion was applied to the complete grid domain including the vehicle and the background regions while keeping the fluid stationary this prevented degradation of the grid quality that may otherwise have occurred as a result of grid deformation to realise the vehicle s motion similarly the boundary conditions led to reduction in the effects due to the proximity of a vehicle to the fluid domain boundaries allowing a reduction in fluid domain size kim et al 2015a the boundary conditions applied were velocity inlet with zero velocity at the inlet pressure outlet at the sides and no slip wall on the vehicle see fig 7 the dynamic deflection of the control planes was realised using the overset gridding technique fig 7 shows the overset interface connecting the background and the overset regions containing the control planes the overset regions were imposed on the background region and rotated at a rate commanded by the autopilot the gap between the planes and the adjacent surface on the hull was around 1 mm in the physical model however the overset interface requires at least three layers in the gap cd adapco 2015 which requires a large number of grid cells with the 1 mm gap thus a 5 mm gap was chosen for the present simulation model resulting in resolution of the gap flow without excessive grid refinement it was assumed the error due to the altered gap flow is sufficiently small as the increased gap was still small compared to the control plane dimensions the actuator disk mimics the effects of a propeller by generating fluid acceleration based on the prescribed magnitude and distribution of fluid momentum sources the axial and circumferential momentum sources were computed based on the propeller performance properties k t and k q with respect to the advance coefficient j this was updated simultaneously with an observed inflow velocity at a plane placed forward of the disk origin by 10 of the disk diameter d as shown in fig 7 the distribution of the momentum sources was prescribed in accordance with the goldstein optimum method goldstein 1929 the method prescribes the distribution of the axial thrust swept volume of the disk and circumferential torque swept volume of the disk momentum components over the radial direction of the actuator disk for the actuator disk used the tangential velocities were neglected and hence the radial momentum component was zero kim et al 2015b the volume of the disk was determined to be equal to that of the propeller phillips et al 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 straight line manoeuvre the 6 dof free running simulations of a straight line manoeuvre was carried out to examine the propeller revolution speeds and thrust forces at the target vehicle s speeds of 0 73 0 97 and 1 19 m s which are equivalent to approximately 6 8 and 10 knots at full scale with the vertical control maintaining the depth and pitch angle the vehicle was initially kept at zero trim and depth at its fixed coordinate and moved in response to the thrust generated by the disk propeller until the thrust and vehicle resistance were in equilibrium the simulation results of the thrust and propeller rotational speed were then compared against experimental data it is noted that the experimental data employed for validation used stern and sail planes for vertical control while the cfd simulations used only stern planes for vertical control this was due to the limited availability of experimental data given that both the sail and stern planes are mainly used to maintain the vertical position for a straight line course the experimental data was still deemed to be acceptable for validating the cfd predictions proving the vertical position i e depth was well preserved by the planes fig 8 shows the cfd and experimental data of the propeller revolution speed and thrust force at the vehicle s set speeds the rotational speed and thrust predictions were in very good agreement with the experimental measurements with differences less than 2 3 2 steady turning manoeuvre the steady turning manoeuvre involved two effective rudder angles δ r 20 and 30 executed at a target speed of approximately 1 19 m s equivalent to 10 knots at full scale when the target speed was reached with a constant propeller rotation the effective rudder angles were prescribed the depth and pitch angle were maintained during the manoeuvre by the stern planes with sail planes kept at zero angle note that all turns were performed to the port side the x y trajectories for both turns are shown in fig 9 table 7 shows the percentage difference between cfd and efd for manoeuvring characteristics as per ittc 2002 presented in the non dimensional form based on vehicle length in both turns cfd predicted a higher transfer the perpendicular distance travelled by the cg from the position at start of the turn at 90 degrees of vehicle s original heading owing to the greater vehicle s thrust forces before reaching a steady turn as the prescribed thrust and torque in the disk propeller are based on a uniform fluid flow the over prediction of the transfer may be caused by the disk propeller being unable to accurately predict the loss of thrust force see fig 10 involving non symmetric flow on the propeller plane overall the maximum discrepancy was found to be 7 26 which still represents a good agreement between cfd and experiments fig 10 shows the time series of the linear velocities and thrust forces for both turns with the effective rudder angle executed at 0 s the velocities from both the cfd and experimental data followed the trends well with cfd slightly over predicting u by a maximum of 2 during the steady turning phase of 30 effective rudder turn see fig 10 b this is attributed to the relatively stronger vortices generated by control planes compared to those of the 20 effective rudder turn the stronger vortices caused the decrease in thrust force in the experiment whereas cfd predictions were limited to due to the absence of the propeller blades and thereby marginally over predicted u further free running simulations using a rotating propeller currently being carried out by the authors will address this discrepancy although the simulation will require significantly greater computational time stern et al 2013 the time histories of the depths z during the turns are shown in fig 11 the discrepancy may be attributed to the coupling nature between pitch angle and depth within the autopilot for example the slight over prediction of pitch angle by about one degree see fig 12 might cause a difference of the predicted depth by 0 05 m in addition it is hypothesised that the setting of the desired values for depth and pitch angle for the calculation of the effective stern plane angle see equation 8 in the autopilot may cause the discrepancy the desired values used in the experiment are unknown whereas those in cfd are set to zero i e original depth at start of the manoeuvre which resulted in a difference in the commanded control plane angles between cfd and experiment see fig 14 nevertheless it is seen in fig 11 that the vehicle s depth gradually decreased and eventually converged to a constant value for both cfd and experiment a time trace of roll ϕ and pitch θ angles is shown in fig 12 it is observed that the vehicle had a tendency to pitch bow up when in a steady turn this is likely attributed to the out of plane forces caused by the presence of the sail resulting in a generation of the downward force on the vehicle s stern region leong et al 2016 as previously discussed the discrepancy in pitch angle may be due to the difference in the effective stern plane angle due to the desired values for depth and pitch angle set in the autopilot another possible cause of the discrepancy might be a slight difference in cb between the cfd and physical models which might possibly be aggravated by the increase in pressure with depth in experimental testing the roll angle caused by a reaction to the propeller torque and side forces on the vehicle was predicted to less than a degree discrepancy the time series of the roll p pitch q and yaw r rates are shown in fig 13 the cfd predictions converge to a fairly constant value and agree well with experimental data the angles of each control plane for effective rudder angle of 20 and 30 turns are shown in fig 14 while the effective rudder angles in equation 5 were set to 20 and 30 the difference in the control plane angles between the cfd and experimental data were due to discrepancies in the calculated effective stern plane angles in equation 6 which was affected by predictions of pitch angle and depth although the cfd predictions in the control plane angles are slightly different from the experimental measurements the control planes are deemed to function correctly as the vehicle s pitch angle and depth were maintained constant during the steady turn shown in figs 11 and 12 4 conclusions this study investigated the capabilities of a cfd free running simulation model through the self propelled bb2 undergoing straight line and steady turning manoeuvres in comparison to experimental data the simulations implemented an actuator disk propeller which prescribed the momentum sources based on the propeller characteristics obtained from a cfd captive self propulsion test included in this study the simulations also incorporated the dynamic deflection of the control planes in which the angles were commanded by an autopilot the results showed that the full 6 dof cfd manoeuvring model is able to predict a vehicle s speed and manoeuvring characteristics i e advance transfer tactical diameter and turning radius that were in satisfactory agreement with experimental data with a maximum error of 7 26 overall this study shows that cfd is able to accurately simulate a free running test which can be a cost effective tool to complement and reduce the more expensive free running experimental work the developed 6 dof manoeuvring simulations will enable the designers to determine a vehicle s manoeuvring characteristics which is essential to design an adequate and accurate control system for the vehicle the capability of the present free running simulation is being extended to incorporate an actual propeller this will allow for replicating the actual rotating flow that is able to address the discrepancies encountered with an actuator disk propeller in addition further work on the

23626,this paper reports on numerical simulations conducted on an underwater vehicle for six degrees of freedom 6 dof free running manoeuvres using computational fluid dynamics cfd the cfd manoeuvring trials straight line and steady turning manoeuvres were conducted using a model scaled bb2 submarine with movable control planes and a body force propeller represented by an actuator disk incorporating predetermined propulsion properties the propulsion properties were obtained from captive self propulsion simulation adopting the actual bb2 propeller the free running simulations were validated against experimental data the results showed that the 6 dof cfd simulations are capable of predicting the bb2 manoeuvring characteristics with good agreement against the experimental data the 6 dof manoeuvring simulations carried out allow for the unsteady viscosity effects which is usually a limitation of the traditional coefficient based prediction method the simulations will enable accurate determination of the vehicle s manoeuvring characteristics which are essential for the control system design and its safe operating envelope keywords computational fluid dynamics underwater vehicles free running model 6 degrees of freedom manoeuvring simulation movable control planes 1 introduction underwater vehicles require control systems that can adjust the control planes of the vehicle in order to carry out course changes and maintain its intended course during a mission the control signals directed to the various control planes are influenced by the vehicle s manoeuvring characteristics thus an accurate determination of the manoeuvring characteristics is essential to ensure that the control system of the vehicle is adequately designed to maintain its desired trajectory for each manoeuvre during a mission or operation the manoeuvring characteristics can be examined using numerical techniques experimental programmes or a combination of both the former includes two approaches i e coefficient based or physics based methods the coefficient based method uses a mathematical model that implements motion equations gertler and hagen 1967 feldman 1979 incorporating hydrodynamic coefficients this method is usually adopted because of its rapid simulation time with predefined constant coefficients however it is limited in its capability to carry out accurate manoeuvring predictions owing to its inability to capture unsteady viscous effects specifically cross flow and vorticity bettle 2013 to overcome these limitations and increase accuracy in the determination of manoeuvring characteristics the physics based method is proposed in this study this involves a free running test of a vehicle moving in response to its control planes propeller and the environment see fig 1 in the past free running tests of underwater vehicles have often been carried out experimentally using physical models operated in controlled environments itard 1999 issac et al 2007 jun et al 2009 and overpelt et al 2015 however they have limitations due to cost and the need for specialised equipment and facilities with increasing capabilities in computational fluid dynamics cfd and high performance computing hpc cfd based free running tests are becoming more affordable and well suited to supplement experimental studies although validation may yet require experimental results chase 2012 conducted a 1 dof degrees of freedom free running cfd simulation of the fully appended suboff groves et al 1989 generic submarine hull with fixed control planes and a rotating propeller the cfd results were validated against experimental self propulsion test data with good agreement in terms of the propulsion properties i e thrust coefficient k t torque coefficient k q and propeller efficiency η at a vehicle speed of 1 75 m s however the work was limited to computing the vehicle s trajectory speeds and accelerations to 1dof due to the intensive computational cost involved with modelling a rotating propeller chase suggested replacing the rotating propeller with a body force propeller model that would significantly reduce the simulation time bettle 2013 developed a 6 dof submarine simulation that involved an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans solver coupled with the submarine equations of motion for the suboff generic submarine the hydrodynamic characteristics of the propeller and controls were represented by force vectors to reduce the computational cost of the model the capability of the bettle s model was evaluated for an emergency rising manoeuvre with the results compared against predictions from a coefficient based simulation the largest difference was found to be a 10 increase in pitch angle bettle attributed this discrepancy to the coefficient based model incorporating rotary hydrodynamic coefficients that were calculated using semi empirical methods as future work to verify the discrepancy bettle suggested the 6 dof urans simulations should include actual control planes and propeller and compared against free running experimental measurements if available coe 2013 developed a 6 dof cfd free running model for a general purpose auv gpauv the study involved urans simulations coupled with a 6 dof rigid body dynamics rbd model using the commercial cfd package star ccm the deflection of the control planes was realised by an overset grid technique in conjuction with a body force propeller the body force propeller involved an actuator disk which produces thrust based on the known propeller performance curves coe stated that the poor agreement in trajectories and velocities from the comparison of free running simulations against free running experimental measurements were not conclusive the poor agreement is mainly due to issues on the experimental trials involving unexplained static offset of rudders e g approximately four degrees offset during the zig zag manoeuvre another possible cause for the discrepancy was that the simulations ignored the d rings which were affixed to the hull to facilitate deployment and recovery of the vehicle coe suggested further work on additional free running experimental measurements for further validation of the cfd results for example performing a steady turning manoeuvre to provide additional insight into the sources of discrepancies between cfd and experimental results the aim of this study is to investigate cfd capabilities as a tool to conduct the 6 dof free running manoeuvring simulations of a fully appended underwater vehicle it extends upon the works by bettle 2013 and coe 2013 by adopting movable control planes and the actuator disk propeller in the 6 dof free running simulation using star ccm the 6 dof simulation is physics based and is able to describe the accelerations of the vehicle with respect to the forces and moments due to weight buoyancy and the hydrodynamic forces the actuator disk propeller is described using the propulsion characteristics obtained through the captive self propulsion test included in this study the credibility of the cfd free running simulation results was established through validation against experimental data provided by overpelt et al 2015 the latter experiments were conducted by marin at the seakeeping and manoeuvring basin smb in wageningen netherlands the basin filled with fresh water having a density of 1000 kg m3 the experimental data was given for full scale in salt water 1025 kg m3 which required scaling based on froude scaling laws with a model scale factor λ of 18 348 overpelt et al 2015 the aft control planes employed a x form configuration consisted of four control planes moving independently to control the horizontal and vertical motions of the vehicle the individual angle of the planes were commanded by an autopilot that used a proportional derivative pd controller with a coupled proportional and derivative control parameter for translations and rotations overpelt et al 2015 the cfd model and its methodology developed in this study can be used by underwater vehicle designers to carry out 6 dof manoeuvring simulations for various vehicle designs configurations and missions addressing the limitation of the coefficient based prediction in accounting for the non linear characteristics of the vehicle due to unsteady viscosity effects the 6 dof physics based simulation will enable the designers to accurately determine a vehicle s manoeuvring characteristics for control system design and its safe operational limits 2 methodology 2 1 investigation programme this study utilised the bb2 generic submarine geometry overpelt et al 2015 which represents a typical conventional ssk submarine the design was derived from hull form introduced by joubert 2006 and the bb2 hull has a full scale length of 70 2 m the bb2 submarine consists of a sail x configuration stern control planes and a hull with a casing on top this study employed the model scale bb2 geometry fig 2 based on froude scaling laws with a scale factor λ of 18 348 giving the model a length of 3 826 m the submarine motion is described through a 6 dof body coordinate frame of reference see fig 3 in which the origin o is located at the centre of gravity cg with the positive directions along the x y and z axes being forward starboard and vertically downwards respectively the motion variables are listed in table 1 the current cfd model ensures that the longitudinal centre of buoyancy lcb is placed at the same position as the longitudinal centre of gravity lcg and the vertical stability lever was set at 0 022 m with the cg below the centre of buoyancy cb this gives a vertical stability lever of 0 0057 l which replicated the physical model the details of the mass properties are presented in table 2 straight line and steady turning manoeuvres cfd free running tests were calculated at the same depth condition i e 2 5 m depth from the water surface in a 5 m deep test basin as the experimental fluid dynamics efd cases the straight line case involved three vehicle speeds 0 73 0 97 and 1 19 m s and the steady turning case involved two effective rudder angles 20 and 30 at a nominal speed of approximately 1 19 m s which is equivalent to a reynolds number re of 5 2 106 the depth and pitch were controlled by an autopilot to maintain the desired vehicle stability all cases adopted movable control planes in conjunction with a body force propeller using an actuator disk which mimicked the propeller propulsion properties obtained from a captive self propulsion test see section 2 3 1 note that sail planes were kept at zero degrees for all manoeuvres a summary of the simulation cases is given in table 3 validation was carried out against experimental measurements provided by overpelt et al 2015 the x stern configuration consisted of four control planes moving independently to maintain translational and rotational stability in 6 dof throughout the course of the manoeuvres the autopilot commanded effective rudder δ r and effective sternplane δ s angles with individual plane angles δ u p p o r t δ d o w n p o r t δ u p s t a r b o a r d and δ d o w n s t a r b o a r d calculated using equations 1 4 based on the right hand rule with the thumb pointing away from the body overpelt et al 2015 note that the maximum plane angle for each of the control planes was limited to 30 1 δ up port δ r δ s 2 δ up starboard δ r δ s 3 δ down starboard δ r δ s 4 δ down port δ r δ s thus the effective rudder and sternplane angles were be calculated as 5 δ r δ up port δ down port δ up starboard δ down starboard 4 6 δ s δ up port δ down port δ up starboard δ down starboard 4 the autopilot and feedback controller utilised a proportional derivative pd controller with associated proportional and differential control parameters for translations and rotations see table 4 as used in the experiment overpelt et al 2015 where e t e d e s i r e e c u r r e n t and d e t d t e t c u r r e n t e t p r e v i o u s t c u r r e n t t p r e v i o u s 2 2 numerical strategy 2 2 1 numerical settings the cfd simulations utilised urans with turbulence model using the elliptic blending reynolds stress model ebrsm coupled to 6 dof rbd kim et al 2015a the urans equations solved the flow field for prediction of the vehicle s hydrodynamics this was then applied to compute the vehicle s resulting motion using the rbd equations with linear and angular momentum solvers for translation and rotation of the vehicle defined as a rigid body with its mass properties as referred in table 2 all simulations in this study were performed under transient conditions to investigate the behaviour of the vehicle in the time domain the fresh water with the same density as measured during the experiments i e 1000 kg m3 was specified for the single phase fluid which was assumed to be incompressible and isothermic to minimise numerical diffusion a second order upwind scheme with a maximum of ten inner iteration loops for convergence per time step was employed in the simulations courant friedrichs lewy cfl numbers were maintained below 6 in the majority of the computational domain throughout the simulations 2 2 2 grid model the type and element size of the grid play an important role in the computation as these influence the convergence and accuracy of the simulated results this study used an unstructured hybrid polyhedral for its ability to represent the complex geometry without excessively dense grid and high time demand inflation layers consisting of polyhedral prisms were applied on the surface of the vehicle to capture its boundary layer the free running simulations are extremely sensitive to the grid resolution on the vehicle s geometry as inaccurate geometrical representation leads to errors in prediction of the vehicle s cb and forces and moments on the vehicle cd adapco 2015 thus it is important to ensure that grid resolution is sufficient to represent the geometry in this study the grid resolution error of the bb2 geometry was maintained at less than 0 02 2 3 free running simulation setup the free running simulation model involved the vehicle operating with movable control planes and a body force propeller the latter is described using the propeller performance characteristics i e k t k q and η that were obtained from the captive self propulsion simulation which was carried out using cfd and employing the propeller geometry used in the experiment overpelt et al 2015 2 3 1 captive self propulsion simulation model 2 3 1 1 model setup fig 4 a shows the grid for a captive self propulsion model with the local refinement on the aft control planes and the propeller tip leading and trailing edges and blade surface regions shown in fig 4 b and the actual experimental model propeller and the aft control planes shown in fig 4 c the grid size on the interface between the propeller and the surrounding fluid flow was prescribed to rotate one grid face per degree based on a maximum applied rotational speed employed during the experiments i e 266 rpm additional grid refinement was carried out on the far field region shown in fig 4 a as variation of the physical quantities in these regions would be comparatively high the total boundary layer thickness and its distribution was achieved through prescribing the first layer thickness reflected by the y value and were estimated based on the calculations presented previously by the authors kim et al 2015b the y values were less than 1 for the hull to adequately resolve the boundary layer and a minimum of 30 for the propeller to allow the first node from the adjacent hull surface to be placed in the log wall region for use with a wall function the boundary conditions applied were a velocity inlet forward of the vehicle with zero velocity pressure outlets at the sides around the vehicle pressure outlet at the boundary aft of the vehicle and no slip walls on the vehicle see fig 7 a 2 3 1 2 discretisation studies to confirm that the grid providing fluid prediction is independent of the grid discretisation resolution a grid dependence study was performed for the vehicle in the captive self propulsion condition the thrust and torque of the propeller and the force in the x direction on the hull were examined for a series of grid levels from coarse to very fine table 5 shows the percentage difference of each grid level compared to the finest grid at the maximum operating propeller revolution of 266 rpm and forward speed of 1 4 m s it is seen that at the fine grid level the predictions of thrust torque and x force were within 1 of the finest very fine grid investigated as a conservative measure the fine grid configuration was adopted for the captive self propulsion simulations the temporal discretisation was examined to ensure sufficient time resolution to capture the 3d transient flow fields around the propeller as well as the vehicle a time step dependence study was carried out at various time steps as shown in table 6 it also shows the percentage difference of the thrust torque and force x between the applied time step and the smallest time step 0 0005 s corresponding to 0 8 degrees of propeller rotation per time step for the propeller it is seen that at the 0 0015 s time step the thrust and torque predictions were within 1 of the smallest time step investigated for the hull a time step of 0 025 s or smaller resulted in the x force being predicted within 1 of the smallest time step as a conservative measure the time step of 0 0015 s was utilised for the self propulsion simulations 2 3 1 3 propeller performance characteristics the performance characteristics of the propeller were predicted from the captive self propulsion tests with a constant rotational speed of 266 rpm and varying freestream velocity at the inlet see fig 5 the advance coefficients j were computed based on the average velocities measured at a plane placed 0 136 m forward of the propeller origin see fig 7 the predicted performance properties were fed into the actuator disk employed in the free running simulations 2 3 2 6 dof free running simulation model the fine grid configuration shown in fig 6 was selected for the free running simulation model the separate grids for the background fluid domain and control planes were connected using the overset interface see fig 7 the additional grid refinement on the propeller wake region shown in fig 7 was prescribed for effective use of the actuator disk cd adapco 2015 the free running vehicle motion was applied to the complete grid domain including the vehicle and the background regions while keeping the fluid stationary this prevented degradation of the grid quality that may otherwise have occurred as a result of grid deformation to realise the vehicle s motion similarly the boundary conditions led to reduction in the effects due to the proximity of a vehicle to the fluid domain boundaries allowing a reduction in fluid domain size kim et al 2015a the boundary conditions applied were velocity inlet with zero velocity at the inlet pressure outlet at the sides and no slip wall on the vehicle see fig 7 the dynamic deflection of the control planes was realised using the overset gridding technique fig 7 shows the overset interface connecting the background and the overset regions containing the control planes the overset regions were imposed on the background region and rotated at a rate commanded by the autopilot the gap between the planes and the adjacent surface on the hull was around 1 mm in the physical model however the overset interface requires at least three layers in the gap cd adapco 2015 which requires a large number of grid cells with the 1 mm gap thus a 5 mm gap was chosen for the present simulation model resulting in resolution of the gap flow without excessive grid refinement it was assumed the error due to the altered gap flow is sufficiently small as the increased gap was still small compared to the control plane dimensions the actuator disk mimics the effects of a propeller by generating fluid acceleration based on the prescribed magnitude and distribution of fluid momentum sources the axial and circumferential momentum sources were computed based on the propeller performance properties k t and k q with respect to the advance coefficient j this was updated simultaneously with an observed inflow velocity at a plane placed forward of the disk origin by 10 of the disk diameter d as shown in fig 7 the distribution of the momentum sources was prescribed in accordance with the goldstein optimum method goldstein 1929 the method prescribes the distribution of the axial thrust swept volume of the disk and circumferential torque swept volume of the disk momentum components over the radial direction of the actuator disk for the actuator disk used the tangential velocities were neglected and hence the radial momentum component was zero kim et al 2015b the volume of the disk was determined to be equal to that of the propeller phillips et al 2008 3 results and discussion 3 1 straight line manoeuvre the 6 dof free running simulations of a straight line manoeuvre was carried out to examine the propeller revolution speeds and thrust forces at the target vehicle s speeds of 0 73 0 97 and 1 19 m s which are equivalent to approximately 6 8 and 10 knots at full scale with the vertical control maintaining the depth and pitch angle the vehicle was initially kept at zero trim and depth at its fixed coordinate and moved in response to the thrust generated by the disk propeller until the thrust and vehicle resistance were in equilibrium the simulation results of the thrust and propeller rotational speed were then compared against experimental data it is noted that the experimental data employed for validation used stern and sail planes for vertical control while the cfd simulations used only stern planes for vertical control this was due to the limited availability of experimental data given that both the sail and stern planes are mainly used to maintain the vertical position for a straight line course the experimental data was still deemed to be acceptable for validating the cfd predictions proving the vertical position i e depth was well preserved by the planes fig 8 shows the cfd and experimental data of the propeller revolution speed and thrust force at the vehicle s set speeds the rotational speed and thrust predictions were in very good agreement with the experimental measurements with differences less than 2 3 2 steady turning manoeuvre the steady turning manoeuvre involved two effective rudder angles δ r 20 and 30 executed at a target speed of approximately 1 19 m s equivalent to 10 knots at full scale when the target speed was reached with a constant propeller rotation the effective rudder angles were prescribed the depth and pitch angle were maintained during the manoeuvre by the stern planes with sail planes kept at zero angle note that all turns were performed to the port side the x y trajectories for both turns are shown in fig 9 table 7 shows the percentage difference between cfd and efd for manoeuvring characteristics as per ittc 2002 presented in the non dimensional form based on vehicle length in both turns cfd predicted a higher transfer the perpendicular distance travelled by the cg from the position at start of the turn at 90 degrees of vehicle s original heading owing to the greater vehicle s thrust forces before reaching a steady turn as the prescribed thrust and torque in the disk propeller are based on a uniform fluid flow the over prediction of the transfer may be caused by the disk propeller being unable to accurately predict the loss of thrust force see fig 10 involving non symmetric flow on the propeller plane overall the

23627,a series of nonlinear finite element analyses were carried out for varying levels of initial deflections welding residual stresses as well as the length and location of cracks to investigate their combined effects on the ultimate strength of intact and cracked steel plates the effects of plate slenderness are also considered based on numerical results it is found out that when the three factors are included in the plate together they will have combined effect on the ultimate strength of the plate rather than a simple superposition of their influences the meaningful phenomenon is revealed that cracks will change the effect of residual stress on the ultimate strength depending on the crack s location and length the crack s breaking effect on residual stress are discussed for three typical crack locations and different crack lengths in the paper the breaking effect will reduce the effect of residual stress where crack is located keywords ultimate strength combined effect initial deflection welding residual stresses crack damage uniaxial compression nonlinear finite element analysis 1 introduction marine structures are inevitable to suffer various kinds of imperfections and damages from fabrication and service as the basic components of ships and offshore structures steel plates are certain to obtain initial deflections and welding residual stresses when they are manufactured and assembled into stiffened plates furthermore crack and corrosion damages may appear in plates when marine structures are in service various imperfections and damages will have significant influences on the ultimate strength of plates so it is necessary to take their combined effect into consideration when making assessment on the ultimate strength of plates many efforts have been made in dealing with the effect of imperfections and damages on the ultimate strength of thin walled structures experiment study has been made by paik et al paik 2008 to investigate

without different locked crack lengths the force displacement relationships dissipated energies strength strain relationships resilience toughness and collapse modes have been presented and analyzed a large amount of numerical investigations have also been done by researchers paik et al paik et al 2005 paik 2009 2012 conducted nonlinear finite element analysis on the residual ultimate strength of steel plates with transverse and longitudinal cracks varying their length and locations under axial tension or compression in their studies initial deflection and welding residual stresses are taken into consideration as an average level they further studied the effect of the welding residual stresses on ultimate strength of high tensile steel plate to calculate its individual effect xu et al 2014 changed the orientation angle of cracks to examine its influence on the strength behavior of plates wang et al paik et al 2015 wang et al 2012 studied the ultimate shear strength of cracked

analysis on effects of welding distortions and residual stresses on the ultimate strength of long rectangular plates under uniaxial compression in the authors previous researches cui et al 2016 2017 the effects of various crack defects on the collapse behavior and ultimate strength have been studied steel plates and stiffened plates in the researches are under uniaxial compression the initial deflection amplitude is kept constant as an average level and the welding residual stresses are ignored other contributions about ultimate strength assessment of steel plates stiffened plates or box girders with imperfections and damages are reported in alinia et al 2007 margaritis and toulios 2012 bayatfar et al 2014 yao et al 1992 1998a paik et al 2004 rahbar ranji and zarookian 2014 abbas and khedmatirigo 2014 yao et al 1998b fujikubo et al 2005 guedes soares 1988 segen et al 2016 shi et al 2017 gannon et al 2012 ao and wang 2016 investigations on the strength behavior of thin walled structures with imperfection and damages have been adequate but most of them are focused on the individual influence of single kind of imperfections or damages while others are left out or kept as a constant researches about combined effect of imperfections and damages on the ultimate strength of structures are limited and not enough this paper aims at making an investigation on the combined effect of initial deflection welding residual stresses and crack damage on the strength behavior of steel plates under uniaxial compression 2 finite element models 2 1 geometric and material properties the geometrical dimensions of steel plates adopted in this paper are the same with the authors previous studies cui et al 2016 2017 the length and breadth of the plates are set as a b 2 550 850 mm three thicknesses 11 16 and 22 mm are adopted these sizes of the plates have been used in the report of ultimate strength committee of issc2012 issc committee ⅲ 1 2012 in previous studies it was concluded that the crack projected length to the transverse direction is a main parameter to predict the ultimate strength of cracked plates it is recognized that transverse crack is the most dangerous case for the strength behavior of plates when the crack length is constant the effect of oblique cracks on the ultimate strength of plates is equivalent to that of transverse cracks provided the projected lengths of oblique cracks have the same length with that of transverse cracks that fact is also verified when combined effect of imperfections and crack damages are both considered as shown in table 1 the level of the initial deflection and residual stress in table 1 are both average levels mentioned in section 2 3 and the projected lengths of oblique cracks here are all 0 2b θ is the inclined angle between oblique cracks and the transverse direction hence at the present paper only the transverse crack is considered for conservative ultimate strength assessment it is also found out by the authors cui et al 2016 that the transverse location of the transverse crack has significantly influence on the ultimate strength of cracked plate under uniaxial compression while the effect of longitudinal location is slight so three typical crack locations are discussed in present paper named as central crack one edge crack and double edge crack they are all set at the mid span in the longitudinal direction of the plates as shown in fig 1 a semi circle is adopted as the shape of the crack tip the length and breadth of the crack are expressed as 2c and w the effect of crack width has been discussed by the authors cui et al 2016 and from the conclusion the crack width w 3 mm is adopted to catch the membrane stress distribution precisely without affecting the ultimate strength of cracked plates it was assumed that the cracks are all through thickness an elastic perfectly plastic model is adopted for material properties the material is high tensile strength steel with its yield stress σ y 313 6 mpa young s modulus e 205800 mpa and poisson s ratio ν 0 3 2 2 boundary and loading conditions at the present study the boundary and loading conditions used in the authors previous studies cui et al 2016 are adopted i e exerting uniform displacement on the two opposite loading edges to apply longitudinal compression actions with the two nodes at the mid span of the longitudinal edge fixed in the x direction and the two nodes at the mid span of the transverse edges are fixed in the y direction to prevent rigid body movement the four edges of the plates are all simply supported coupled boundary condition is applied on the unloaded edges to ensure y displacements of its nodes are the same rigid zones are set at the loaded edges to guarantee the nodes can move together with the same value in the x direction the boundary and loading conditions are illustrated in fig 2 2 3 initial imperfections during welding in fabrication initial deformation and residual stress will take place in steel plates they are two of the most common initial imperfections in plates for the reason that initial imperfections have effects on the ultimate strength behavior of thin walled structures many investigations have been made to consider their influence yao et al 1992 1998a and paik et al 2004 have studied the effects of initial deflection on the buckling and collapse behavior of plates a double fourier series is widely adopted in their researches in present paper the lowest buckling mode is used to simulate the initial deflection shape it is in fact a simplest case of the double fourier series expressed as the following function 1 w a 0 sin m π x a sin π y b where a and b are the length and width of the plate m is an integer equal to a b it stands for the buckling half wave number in the longitudinal direction when a b is not an integer m is taken as the minimum integer satisfying the condition bellow 2 a b m m 1 a 0 is the amplitude of the initial deflection the average level a 0 0 1β 2 t is usually adopted in many literature but in real practice the magnitude of the initial deflection can t be the same value so three levels of a 0 i e slight level 0 025β 2 t average level 0 1β 2 t and severe level 0 3β 2 t are adopted to account for its effect besides a series of interval values are also studied among the three levels of a 0 to explore the detailed variation trend of ultimate strength as a 0 varies β b t σ y e is the plate slenderness ratio in present study a and b are kept constant so β is only related to the thickness of the plate t in the typical range of thin plates slenderness ratio β 1 5 3 5 a series of β is adopted as the thickness changes there are various kinds of welding residual stress distributions in steel plates an idealization of welding residual stress distribution is adopted for simplification where the tensile residual stress block is located in the heat affected zone and the compressive residual stress block exists in the middle of the plate element paik 2012 and this distribution shall develop in both longitudinal and transverse directions the tensile residual stresses value σ rt is assigned as the yield stress σ y the compressive residual stress σ rc is taken as 0 05σ y for slight level 0 15σ y for average level and 0 3σ y for severe level 2 4 adopted element and mesh convergence study shell181 in the finite element code ansys ansys 2007 is adopted for nonlinear finite element analysis both geometric and material nonlinearities are taken into account it is a common sense to set relatively coarse mesh away from the crack and refined mesh in the vicinity of the crack to catch the stress concentration behavior near the crack tip for efficiency a mapped mesh of a plate is shown in fig 2 the local refined mesh around the crack tip is also shown in the zoom part of fig 2 in order to find a balance between accuracy and computational time a mesh convergence study must be made a sensitivity study analysis of the number of elements n e near the crack tips has been made by xu et al 2014 he found that the ultimate strength values are almost unchanged with the increase of n e so n e is set to 16 for all the fe analyses dense mesh is generated near the crack tips and the mesh size is gradually increased away from the crack tips for the mesh away from the crack three levels of density are considered the three meshing densities of a central cracked plate are shown in table 2 where 2c b 0 5 n x and n y are the number of elements along longitudinal and transverse edges respectively n sum is the total number of elements the differences are made compared with the case middle mesh it can be seen from the result shown in table 2 that there is little difference between the three meshing strategies while refined mesh can show the stress distribution more precisely the middle mesh is adopted in present paper to make a compromise between accuracy and computational time 3 numerical results and discussions the ultimate strength reduction characteristics of a cracked plate with combined imperfections under uniaxial compression are investigated by ansys finite element fe analysis the nlfem analysis is done using newton raphson nr method in ansys software the numerical analyses of intact plates are also conducted here for the purpose of comparison the non dimensional ultimate strength σ u σ y non dimensional average stress σ σ y and non dimensional average strain ε ε y are adopted as main parameters to represent strength behaviors of plates the eigenvalue buckling analysis is done before the ultimate strength analysis to provide an initial deflection shape for the nonlinear post buckling analysis three types of buckling modes are extracted as shown in fig 3 the lowest buckling mode i e the first buckling mode is adopted as the deformation shape of initial deflection the strain energy of this buckling mode is lowest and easiest to reach the accuracy of newton raphson nr method solving procedure is verified by a comparison with the empirical faulkner formulation faulkner 1975 the average stress average strain curve for an intact plate is obtained using newton raphson nr method in fig 4 the ultimate strength calculated from faulkner formula eq 3 is also shown in fig 4 the difference of ultimate strength values by the two methods is recorded in table 3 it can be seen that the results from the two methods are very close so the fe results from newton raphson nr method are reasonable 3 σ u σ y 2 β 1 β 2 β 1 0 3 1 intact plates with initial deflections the double fourier function mentioned in subsection 2 3 is adopted as initial deflection shape for simplification a series of the magnitude value a 0 are listed in table 4 the ultimate strengths of plates with different a 0 are calculated and plotted in fig 5 a fig 5b shows the average stress average strain curves for the plates with a 0 of the slight level 0 025β 2 t average level 0 1β 2 t and severe level 0 3β 2 t fig 5a presents a relationship between non dimensional ultimate strength σ u σ y and initial deflection amplitude a 0 it is observed from fig 5a that the ultimate strength of plate decreases as a 0 increases but the decrease rate slow down for larger a 0 that means the decrease of ultimate strength tend to be moderate with the increase of a 0 fig 5b shows the average stress average strain curves for the plates with three typical initial deflection magnitudes it is seen from fig 5b that the initial deflection magnitude affects the trend of initial stiffness and post ultimate strength when a 0 increases from the slight level 0 025β 2 t to the severe level 0 3β 2 fig 6 shows the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of the plates at uls ultimate limit state the equivalent stress distributions of the plates are quite different but the collapse shapes with three levels of initial deflection are just the same 3 2 intact plates with welding residual stresses the level of welding residual stresses is determined by compressive residual stress magnitudes mentioned in subsection 2 3 the stress block widths are obtained by equilibrium condition between tensile and compressive residual stress blocks as 4 2 b t σ r c x σ r c x σ r t x b 2 a t σ r c y σ r c y σ r t y a where a t and b t are the stress tensile block widths in transverse and longitudinal directions respectively the subscript x and y under stress denote transverse and longitudinal directions the simplified distribution of welding residual stresses block is shown in fig 7 in both longitudinal and transverse directions with σ rcy b a σ rcx according to the existing research paik 2012 among others the effect of welding residual stress on the ultimate strength of plates has a relationship to the slenderness ratio β in this paper three β values i e β 1 51 t 22 mm β 2 07 t 16 mm and β 3 02 t 11 mm from the general β range of ship and offshore structure plates are adopted three levels of welding residual stresses as mentioned in subsection 2 3 are applied on each plate with different β values plates without residual stress are also included for comparison the average level of initial deflection 0 1β 2 t is employed here the average stress average strain curves and buckling modes as well as equivalent stress distributions of the plates at uls ultimate limit state are plotted in fig 8 from fig 8 it is easy to see that the welding residual stresses lead to a slight reduction of the initial stiffness and ultimate strength of plates and the negative effect on the ultimate strength value tend to become smaller as the value of β increases the effect of residual stress on ultimate strength reduction can be ignored when β is around 3 as the compressive ultimate strength is studied in present paper the external load will firstly make equilibrium with the tensile residual stress and then reach the ultimate limit state the compressive residual stress can be regarded as pre stress and make the ultimate limit state easier to reach so it s recognized that the tensile residual stress has positive effect on the compressive ultimate strength of plates while the compressive residual stress has negative one according to the results obtained here it is obvious that the effect of compressive residual stress is larger than that of the tensile residual stress it may be due to the reason that the affected area of the compressive residual stress is larger than that of the tensile residual stress it is also concluded from fig 9 that the welding residual stresses have effects on the stress distributions of the plates at uls ultimate limit state but the buckling modes are not affected by welding residual stresses fig 10 presents the average stress average strain curves and fig 11 shows buckling modes as well as equivalent stress distributions of the plates with residual stresses in both x and y directions at uls ultimate limit state the compressive residual stresses are set as σ rcx 0 15σ y and σ rcy b a σ rcx it can be seen that the residual stresses in y direction transverse direction have little effect on the ultimate strength of plates under longitudinal compression except in the case of very small β value as the longitudinal compression is the predominant load to be studied in present paper only the residual stress in x direction is taken into consideration 3 3 intact plates with initial deflections and welding residual stresses in order to check the combined effect of initial deflections and welding residual stresses on the ultimate strength of plates a series of plates with different levels of initial deflections and residual stresses are investigated the plates with β 1 51 t 22 mm which are sensitive to the effect of residual stresses are employed in this section the differences of the ultimate strength are listed in table 5 the ultimate strength of the plate with the average level of initial deflection 0 100β 2 t and without residual stresses is taken as the standard value for comparison the ultimate strength values in various cases are plotted in fig 12 it can be seen from table 5 and fig 12 that initial deflections and welding residual stresses have a combined effect on the ultimate strength of plates this combined effect on the ultimate strength of plate decreases as the level of the compressive residual stress increases until the initial deflection level a 0 reaches a certain high level after a 0 reaches the value about 0 300β 2 t the effect is reversed the ultimate strength of plates even has a slight increase along with the increase of residual stresses considering that the value of a 0 is below the severe level in most actual situations in ships and offshore structures welding residual stresses may still be considered to have negative effects on strength behaviors of intact plates even so the combined effect of the initial deflection and welding residual stresses cannot always be treated as a simple linear superposition result it is seen from the results shown in fig 12 that the negative effect of initial deflection magnitude on the ultimate strength of plates is more obvious when the two imperfections are both considered the effect of welding residual stresses becomes smaller and smaller as the value of a 0 increases so it is reasonable for many researchers to neglect welding residual stresses for simplicity when considering the ultimate strength of plates 3 4 cracked plates with initial deflections the effect on the collapse behavior of plates and stiffened plates with various crack damages has been investigated in the previous research work by the authors cui et al 2016 2017 but in the studies the initial deflection magnitude is kept constant and the effect of deflection level is not considered here three types of crack mentioned in subsection 2 1 are employed and three levels of initial deflection magnitude are considered to take the combined effect of crack damages and initial deflections into consideration the slenderness ratio β 3 02 t 11 mm of plate is adopted in this section fig 13 demonstrates the ultimate strength of three kinds of cracked plates with varying crack length as well as initial deflection level it is obvious that the double edge crack and one edge crack result in larger reductions of the ultimate strength of plates than that of the central crack the common characterization for different levels of initial deflections is that the curves of ultimate strength vs crack length are parallel when crack lengths vary below a certain length in the three kinds of cracked plates this phenomenon illustrates that the combined effect of the crack length and initial deflection level can be regarded as a linear superposition the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of the cracked plates at uls ultimate limit state are illustrated in fig 14 the deformation shapes are not changed for different crack types but the equivalent stress distribution is quite different as the location of the crack changes it is easy to see that the crack damage causes a stress concentration at crack tips 3 5 cracked plates with welding residual stresses in this section the crack length i e 2c b as shown in fig 1 is varied in the range of 0 1 0 5 the level of welding residual stresses is also changed to examine their combined effect on the plate ultimate strength the slenderness ratio β is set as 3 02 t 11 mm the amplitude of initial deflection a 0 0 1β 2 t is adopted for analysis in order to observe the effect of crack damage the crack length is firstly set as 2c b 0 5 it is evident from fig 15 that the existing of cracks causes evident reduction of the ultimate strength of plates compared to the result of intact plate shown in fig 8 furthermore cracks enhances the negative effect of welding residual stress on the initial stiffness and ultimate strength of plates it is known from subsection 3 2 and 3 4 that both of the welding residual stresses and cracks led to strength decrease of plates when they are considered individually fig 15a and b present their combined effect on the ultimate strength of one edge or double edge cracked plates but in fig 15c the situation is reversed in the case of central crack the ultimate strength increases as the compressive residual stress increases when the central crack length is 2c b 0 5 one reasonable explanation to this phenomenon may be that the crack has a breaking effect on the propagation of residual stress for the cases of double edge crack and one edge crack the breaking effect mainly happens in tensile residual stresses zones and only the compressive residual stress has the dominating influence on the strength behavior of plates this will led to a greater reduction of the ultimate strength but for central crack case the breaking effect mainly happens in compressive residual stress zone the tensile residual stresses may play a dominant role in the strength behavior that means the ultimate strength may increase as the increasing of the residual stress this will happen when the central crack length is long enough the negative effect of compressive residual stress is less than the positive one of the tensile residual stresses in this case to verify the explanation for the breaking effect of cracks a series of numerical studies are conducted for the cracked plates with various crack lengths the compressive residual stresses are kept as 0 30σ y the cracked plates without residual stress are also included for comparison the results are plotted in fig 16 from fig 16 the trends of curves of ultimate strength vs crack length agree well with the expectation previously in case of central cracked plates the cracks are located in compressive residual stress zone which will weaken the negative effect of the compressive residual stress it is well known that the tensile residual stress have a positive effect on the compressive ultimate strength of plates while the compressive residual stress has a negative one and in most cases the negative effect of compressive residual stress is larger than that of the tensile residual stress so the ultimate strength of cracked plates with residual stress will be less than that of cracked plates without residual stress but when the crack length reaches a certain value the negative effect of compressive residual stress will be equal to the positive effect of tensile residual stress this certain value just corresponds to the intersection point of the two curves in fig 16a the corresponding crack length is about 0 34b in this case after the crack length is longer than 0 34b the breaking effect of cracks causes the effect of the compressive residual stress smaller than that of tensile residual stress that means the ultimate strength of cracked plates with residual stress will be larger than that of cracked plates without residual stress in this situation this trend is reflected well in fig 16a in double edge cracked plates the cracks are located in tensile residual stress zones or extend to part of compressive residual stress zone because of the breaking effect in the tensile residual stress zone the effect of compressive residual stress on the ultimate strength will always be dominant that means the ultimate strength of cracked plates with residual stress will always be smaller than that of cracked plates without residual stress as shown in fig 16b in one edge cracked plates the situation is similar to that of double edge cracked plates as long as 2c b 0 5 but when the crack length reaches 0 5b the breaking effect applies on both half part of tensile residual stress zones and compressive residual stress zone that means the opposite effects are the same from tensile and compressive residual stresses which will led to the same ultimate strength value of plates with and without residual stress the abscissa of the intersection point is 2c b 0 5 for this case figs 17 19 show the equivalent stress distributions of cracked plates with and without welding residual stress at uls ultimate limit state as can be seen the cracks and welding residual stresses effect obviously on equivalent stress distributions of plates 4 conclusions the aim of present paper is to investigate the combined effect of imperfections and cracks on the ultimate strength characteristics of steel plates subjected to uniaxial compression by numerical analysis a series of elastic plastic large deflection analyses have been carried out with various initial deflection levels welding residual stress levels crack lengths and crack locations based on the nonlinear numerical results in present study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the ultimate strength of intact plate decreases as initial defection amplitude a 0 increases but the decrease rate slow down for larger a 0 the welding residual stresses lead to a slight reduction in the initial stiffness and ultimate strength of intact plate and the negative effect on the ultimate strength tend to become smaller as the value of β increases the residual stresses in transverse direction have little effect on the ultimate strength of intact plates under longitudinal compression except in the case of very small β value 2 the combined effect of the initial deflection and welding residual stresses on the ultimate strength of intact plates cannot be taken as a simple linear superposition result the initial deflection magnitude plays a dominant role in the negative effect on the ultimate strength of plates when the two imperfections are considered at the same time 3 the combined effect of the crack length and initial deflection level can be regarded as a linear superposition as long as the crack length is not too long when the crack length is excessive the effect of crack damage in the ultimate strength of plates takes the dominant position 4 the effect of crack length and welding residual stress is different on different type of cracked plates there is a breaking effect of crack on the residual stress the breaking effect will reduce the effect of residual stress where crack is located for central cracked plates the breaking effect will reduce the effect of compressive residual stress so the cracked plate with residual stress can have a higher ultimate strength than that without considering residual stress as long as the crack length is longer than a certain value for one edge cracked plates the phenomenon is similar as the central cracked plate if the crack length is longer enough but for double edge cracked plate the phenomenon will not happen because the break effect of cracks reduce the positive effect of tensile residual stress nevertheless all kinds of cracks have enhanced the effect of welding residual stress on the initial stiffness and ultimate strength of plates 5 the obtained results in this paper may not be directly generalized to other cases with different material properties or dimensions because of the reason of non linearity but the same analysis procedure can be applied to other cases in the analysis procedure conducted in present paper individual effect of each factor is firstly studied then the combined effect of multiple factors can be studied using control variate method furthermore the combination effect of initial imperfections on the ultimate strength of plates with other damages such as corrosions perforations dents etc need to be further studied

23627,a series of nonlinear finite element analyses were carried out for varying levels of initial deflections welding residual stresses as well as the length and location of cracks to investigate their combined effects on the ultimate strength of intact and cracked steel plates the effects of plate slenderness are also considered based on numerical results it is found out that when the three factors are included in the plate together they will have combined effect on the ultimate strength of the plate rather than a simple superposition of their influences the meaningful phenomenon is revealed that cracks will change the effect of residual stress on the ultimate strength depending on the crack s location and length the crack s breaking effect on residual stress are discussed for three typical crack locations and different crack lengths in the paper the breaking effect will reduce the effect of residual stress where crack is located keywords ultimate strength combined effect initial deflection welding residual stresses crack damage uniaxial compression nonlinear finite element analysis 1 introduction marine structures are inevitable to suffer various kinds of imperfections and damages from fabrication and service as the basic components of ships and offshore structures steel plates are certain to obtain initial deflections and welding residual stresses when they are manufactured and assembled into stiffened plates furthermore crack and corrosion damages may appear in plates when marine structures are in service various imperfections and damages will have significant influences on the ultimate strength of plates so it is necessary to take their combined effect into consideration when making assessment on the ultimate strength of plates many efforts have been made in dealing with the effect of imperfections and damages on the ultimate strength of thin walled structures experiment study has been made by paik et al paik 2008 to investigate

effect of initial deflection welding residual stresses and crack damage on the strength behavior of steel plates under uniaxial compression 2 finite element models 2 1 geometric and material properties the geometrical dimensions of steel plates adopted in this paper are the same with the authors previous studies cui et al 2016 2017 the length and breadth of the plates are set as a b 2 550

coarse mesh away from the crack and refined mesh in the vicinity of the crack to catch the stress concentration behavior near the crack tip for efficiency a mapped mesh of a plate is shown in fig 2 the local refined mesh around the crack tip is also shown in the zoom part of fig 2 in order to find a balance between accuracy and computational time a mesh convergence study must be made a sensitivity study analysis of the number of elements n e near the crack tips has been made by xu et al 2014 he found that the ultimate strength values are almost unchanged with the increase of n e so n e is set to 16 for all the fe analyses dense mesh is generated near the crack tips and the mesh size is gradually increased away from the crack tips for the mesh away from the crack three levels of density are considered the three meshing densities of a central cracked plate are shown in table 2 where 2c b 0 5 n x and n y are the number of elements along longitudinal and transverse edges respectively n sum is the total number of elements the differences are made compared with the case middle mesh it can be seen from the result shown in table 2 that there is little difference between the three meshing strategies while refined mesh can show the stress distribution more precisely the middle mesh is adopted in present paper to make a compromise between accuracy and computational time 3 numerical results and discussions the ultimate strength reduction characteristics of a cracked plate with combined imperfections under uniaxial compression are investigated by ansys finite element fe analysis the nlfem analysis is done using newton raphson nr method in ansys software the numerical analyses of intact plates are also conducted here for the purpose of comparison the non dimensional ultimate strength σ u σ y non dimensional average stress σ σ y and non dimensional average strain ε ε y are adopted as main parameters to represent strength behaviors of plates the eigenvalue buckling analysis is done before the ultimate strength analysis to provide an initial deflection shape for the nonlinear post buckling analysis three types of buckling modes are extracted as shown in fig 3 the lowest buckling mode i e the first buckling mode is adopted as the deformation shape of initial deflection the strain energy of this buckling mode is lowest and easiest to reach the accuracy of newton raphson nr method solving procedure is verified by a comparison with the empirical faulkner formulation faulkner 1975 the average stress average strain curve for an intact plate is obtained using newton raphson nr method in fig 4 the ultimate strength calculated from faulkner formula eq 3 is also shown in fig 4 the difference of ultimate strength values by the two methods is recorded in table 3 it can be seen that the results from the two methods are very close so the fe results from newton raphson nr method are reasonable 3 σ u σ y 2 β 1 β 2 β 1 0 3 1 intact plates with initial deflections the double fourier function mentioned in subsection 2 3 is adopted as initial deflection shape for simplification a series of the magnitude value a 0 are listed in table 4 the ultimate strengths of plates with different a 0 are calculated and plotted in fig 5 a fig 5b shows the average stress average strain curves for the plates with a 0 of the slight level 0 025β 2 t average level 0 1β 2 t and severe level 0 3β 2 t fig 5a presents a relationship between non dimensional ultimate strength σ u σ y and initial deflection amplitude a 0 it is observed from fig 5a that the ultimate strength of plate decreases as a 0 increases but the decrease rate slow down for larger a 0 that means the decrease of ultimate strength tend to be moderate with the increase of a 0 fig 5b shows the average stress average strain curves for the plates with three typical initial deflection magnitudes it is seen from fig 5b that the initial deflection magnitude affects the trend of initial stiffness and post ultimate strength when a 0 increases from the slight level 0 025β 2 t to the severe level 0 3β 2 fig 6 shows the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of the plates at uls ultimate limit state the equivalent stress distributions of the plates are quite different but the collapse shapes with three levels of initial deflection are just the same 3 2 intact plates with welding residual stresses the level of welding residual stresses is determined by compressive residual stress magnitudes mentioned in subsection 2 3 the stress block widths are obtained by equilibrium condition between tensile and compressive residual stress blocks as 4 2 b t σ r c x σ r c x σ r t x b 2 a t σ r c y σ r c y σ r t y a where a t and b t are the stress tensile block widths in transverse and longitudinal directions respectively the subscript x and y under stress denote transverse and longitudinal directions the simplified distribution of welding residual stresses block is shown in fig 7 in both longitudinal and transverse directions with σ rcy b a σ rcx according to the existing research paik 2012 among others the effect of welding residual stress on the ultimate strength of plates has a relationship to the slenderness ratio β in this paper three β values i e β 1 51 t 22 mm β 2 07 t 16 mm and β 3 02 t 11 mm from the general β range of ship and offshore structure plates are adopted three levels of welding residual stresses as mentioned in subsection 2 3 are applied on each plate with different β values plates without residual stress are also included for comparison the average level of initial deflection 0 1β 2 t is employed here the average stress average strain curves and buckling modes as well as equivalent stress distributions of the plates at uls ultimate limit state are plotted in fig 8 from fig 8 it is easy to see that the welding residual stresses lead to a slight reduction of the initial stiffness and ultimate strength of plates and the negative effect on the ultimate strength value tend to become smaller as the value of β increases the effect of residual stress on ultimate strength reduction can be ignored when β is around 3 as the compressive ultimate strength is studied in present paper the external load will firstly make equilibrium with the tensile residual stress and then reach the ultimate limit state the compressive residual stress can be regarded as pre stress and make the ultimate limit state easier to reach so it s recognized that the tensile residual stress has positive effect on the compressive ultimate strength of plates while the compressive residual stress has negative one according to the results obtained here it is obvious that the effect of compressive residual stress is larger than that of the tensile residual stress it may be due to the reason that the affected area of the compressive residual stress is larger than that of the tensile residual stress it is also concluded from fig 9 that the welding residual stresses have effects on the stress distributions of the plates at uls ultimate limit state but the buckling modes are not affected by welding residual stresses fig 10 presents the average stress average strain curves and fig 11 shows buckling modes as well as equivalent stress distributions of the plates with residual stresses in both x and y directions at uls ultimate limit state the compressive residual stresses are set as σ rcx 0 15σ y and σ rcy b a σ rcx it can be seen that the residual stresses in y direction transverse direction have little effect on the ultimate strength of plates under longitudinal compression except in the case of very small β value as the longitudinal compression is the predominant load to be studied in present paper only the residual stress in x direction is taken into consideration 3 3 intact plates with initial deflections and welding residual stresses in order to check the combined effect of initial deflections and welding residual stresses on the ultimate strength of plates a series of plates with different levels of initial deflections and residual stresses are investigated the plates with β 1 51 t 22 mm which are sensitive to the effect of residual stresses are employed in this section the differences of the ultimate strength are listed in table 5 the ultimate strength of the plate with the average level of initial deflection 0 100β 2 t and without residual stresses is taken as the standard value for comparison the ultimate strength values in various cases are plotted in fig 12 it can be seen from table 5 and fig 12 that initial deflections and welding residual stresses have a combined effect on the ultimate strength of plates this combined effect on the ultimate strength of plate decreases as the level of the compressive residual stress increases until the initial deflection level a 0 reaches a certain high level after a 0 reaches the value about 0 300β 2 t the effect is reversed the ultimate strength of plates even has a slight increase along with the increase of residual stresses considering that the value of a 0 is below the severe level in most actual situations in ships and offshore structures welding residual stresses may still be considered to have negative effects on strength behaviors of intact plates even so the combined effect of the initial deflection and welding residual stresses cannot always be treated as a simple linear superposition result it is seen from the results shown in fig 12 that the negative effect of initial deflection magnitude on the ultimate strength of plates is more obvious when the two imperfections are both considered the effect of welding residual stresses becomes smaller and smaller as the value of a 0 increases so it is reasonable for many researchers to neglect welding residual stresses for simplicity when considering the ultimate strength of plates 3 4 cracked plates with initial deflections the effect on the collapse behavior of plates and stiffened plates with various crack damages has been investigated in the previous research work by the authors cui et al 2016 2017 but in the studies the initial deflection magnitude is kept constant and the effect of deflection level is not considered here three types of crack mentioned in subsection 2 1 are employed and three levels of initial deflection magnitude are considered to take the combined effect of crack damages and initial deflections into consideration the slenderness ratio β 3 02 t 11 mm of plate is adopted in this section fig 13 demonstrates the ultimate strength of three kinds of cracked plates with varying crack length as well as initial deflection level it is obvious that the double edge crack and one edge crack result in larger reductions of the ultimate strength of plates than that of the central crack the common characterization for different levels of initial deflections is that the curves of ultimate strength vs crack length are parallel when crack lengths vary below a certain length in the three kinds of cracked plates this phenomenon illustrates that the combined effect of the crack length and initial deflection level can be regarded as a linear superposition the buckling modes and equivalent stress distributions of the cracked plates at uls ultimate limit state are illustrated in fig 14 the deformation shapes are not changed for different crack types but the equivalent stress distribution is quite different as the location of the crack changes it is easy to see that the crack damage causes a stress concentration at crack tips 3 5 cracked plates with welding residual stresses in this section the crack length i e 2c b as shown in fig 1 is varied in the range of 0 1 0 5 the level of welding residual stresses is also changed to examine their combined effect on the plate ultimate strength the slenderness ratio β is set as 3 02 t 11 mm the amplitude of initial deflection a 0 0 1β 2 t is adopted for analysis in order to observe the effect of crack damage the crack length is firstly set as 2c b 0 5 it is evident from fig 15 that the existing of cracks causes evident reduction of the ultimate strength of plates compared to the result of intact plate shown in fig 8 furthermore cracks enhances the negative effect of welding residual stress on the initial stiffness and ultimate strength of plates it is known from subsection 3 2 and 3 4 that both of the welding residual stresses and cracks led to strength decrease of plates when they are considered individually fig 15a and b present their combined effect on the ultimate strength of one edge or double edge cracked plates but in fig 15c the situation is reversed in the case of central crack the ultimate strength increases as the compressive residual stress increases when the central crack length is 2c b 0 5 one reasonable explanation to this phenomenon may be that the crack has a breaking effect on the propagation of residual stress for the cases of double edge crack and one edge crack the breaking effect mainly happens in tensile residual stresses zones and only the compressive residual stress has the dominating influence on the strength behavior of plates this will led to a greater reduction of the ultimate strength but for central crack case the breaking effect mainly happens in compressive residual stress zone the tensile residual stresses may play a dominant role in the strength behavior that means the ultimate strength may increase as the increasing of the residual stress this will happen when the central crack length is long enough the negative effect of compressive residual stress is less than the positive one of the tensile residual stresses in this case to verify the explanation for the breaking effect of cracks a series of numerical studies are conducted for the cracked plates with various crack lengths the compressive residual stresses are kept as 0 30σ y the cracked plates without residual stress are also included for comparison the results are plotted in fig 16 from fig 16 the trends of curves of ultimate strength vs crack length agree well with the expectation previously in case of central cracked plates the cracks are located in compressive residual stress zone which will weaken the negative effect of the compressive residual stress it is well known that the tensile residual stress have a positive effect on the compressive ultimate strength of plates while the compressive residual stress has a negative one and in most cases the negative effect of compressive residual stress is larger than that of the tensile residual stress so the ultimate strength of cracked plates with residual stress will be less than that of cracked plates without residual stress but when the crack length reaches a certain value the negative effect of compressive residual stress will be equal to the positive effect of tensile residual stress this certain value just corresponds to the intersection point of the two curves in fig 16a the corresponding crack length is about 0 34b in this case after the crack length is longer than 0 34b the breaking effect of cracks causes the effect of the compressive residual stress smaller than that of tensile residual stress that means the ultimate strength of cracked plates with residual stress will be larger than that of cracked plates without residual stress in this situation this trend is reflected well in fig 16a in double edge cracked plates the cracks are located in tensile residual stress zones or extend to part of compressive residual stress zone because of the breaking effect in the tensile residual stress zone the effect of compressive residual stress on the ultimate strength will always be dominant that means the ultimate strength of cracked plates with residual stress will always be smaller than that of cracked plates without residual stress as shown in fig 16b in one edge cracked plates the situation is similar to that of double edge cracked plates as long as 2c b 0 5 but when the crack length reaches 0 5b the breaking effect applies on both half part of tensile residual stress zones and compressive residual stress zone that means the opposite effects are the same from tensile and compressive residual stresses which will led to the same ultimate strength value of plates with and without residual stress the abscissa of the intersection point is 2c b 0 5 for this case figs 17 19 show the equivalent stress distributions of cracked plates with and without welding residual stress at uls ultimate limit state as can be seen the cracks and welding residual stresses effect obviously on equivalent stress distributions of plates 4 conclusions the aim of present paper is to investigate the combined effect of imperfections and cracks on the ultimate strength characteristics of steel plates subjected to uniaxial compression by numerical analysis a series of elastic plastic large deflection analyses have been carried out with various initial deflection levels welding residual stress levels crack lengths and crack locations based on the nonlinear numerical results in present study the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the ultimate strength of intact plate decreases as initial defection amplitude a 0 increases but the decrease rate slow down for larger a 0 the welding residual stresses lead to a slight reduction in the initial stiffness and ultimate strength of intact plate and the negative effect on the ultimate strength tend to become smaller as the value of β increases the residual stresses in transverse direction have little effect on the ultimate strength of intact plates under longitudinal compression except in the case of very small β value 2 the combined effect of the initial deflection and welding residual stresses on the ultimate strength of intact plates cannot be taken as a simple linear superposition result the initial deflection magnitude plays a dominant role in the negative effect on the ultimate strength of plates when the two imperfections are considered at the same time 3 the combined effect of the crack length and initial deflection level can be regarded as a linear superposition as long as the crack length is not too long when the crack length is excessive the effect of crack damage in the ultimate strength of plates takes the dominant position 4 the effect of crack length and welding residual stress is different on different type of cracked plates there is a breaking effect of crack on the residual stress the breaking effect will reduce the effect of residual stress where crack is located for central cracked plates the breaking effect will reduce the effect of compressive residual stress so the cracked plate with residual stress can have a higher ultimate strength than that without considering residual stress as long as the crack length is longer than a certain value for one edge cracked plates the phenomenon is similar as the central cracked plate if the crack length is longer enough but for double edge cracked plate the phenomenon will not happen because the break effect of cracks reduce the positive effect of tensile residual stress nevertheless all kinds of cracks have enhanced the effect of welding residual stress on the initial stiffness and ultimate strength of plates 5 the obtained results in this paper may not be directly generalized to other cases with different material properties or dimensions because of the reason of non linearity but the same analysis procedure can be applied to other cases in the analysis procedure conducted in present paper individual effect of each factor is firstly studied then the combined effect of multiple factors can be studied using control variate method furthermore the combination effect of initial imperfections on the ultimate strength of plates with other damages such as corrosions perforations dents etc need to be further studied

23628,ship routing process taking into account weather conditions is a constrained multi objective optimization problem and it should consider various optimization criteria and constraints formulation of a stability related dynamic route optimization constraint is presented in this paper one of the key objectives of a cross ocean sailing is finding a compromise between ship safety and economics of operation this compromise should be taken into account by the planning procedure and proper optimization algorithm in this research complex stability related phenomena are adopted as the basis for the constraint set formulation in weather routing thus the synchronous roll parametric resonance surf riding and broaching to are considered according to the imo msc 1 circ 1228 guidance however the dangerous resonance motion of the ship depends on her natural period of roll and a degree of tuning to the encounter wave period this natural period strictly depends on the gz curve shape and consequently on the amplitude of roll in order to properly model the natural period of roll a new method utilizing equivalent metacentric height is applied and incorporated into the route optimization sample calculations of the cross ocean routes are presented and the effect of the dynamic approach to the constraint set is demonstrated and discussed keywords weather routing multi objective constrained optimization ship synchronous rolling resonance frequency of rolling equivalent metacentric height natural period of ship roll 1 introduction decision support tools utilizing intelligent technologies experience rapid growth and find numerous application in maritime related fields nowadays one of the hottest paradigms in the maritime traffic management is e navigation strictly linked to such modern technologies this paradigm has been defined by the international maritime organization imo already in 2005 stating that imo 2005 e navigation is expected to provide digital information and infrastructure for the benefit of maritime safety security and protection of the marine environment reducing the administrative burden and increasing the efficiency of maritime trade and transport in practice it is going to be implemented as an integration of existing and new electronic telecommunication and computer based digital services supporting ship navigation processes common maritime data structure cmds lays beneath the core e navigation concept as its data model covers all aspects of the shipping and maritime domain however there are already proposals to extend cmds towards a universal marine information registry jonas and oltmann 2013 the main purpose of e navigation is to increase safety and efficiency of maritime transportation patraiko 2007 in 2014 imo has prepared e navigation strategy implementation plan sip imo 2014 the sip includes tasks defined for five prioritized solutions required for a successful e navigation implementation and deployment namely 1 improved harmonized and user friendly bridge design 2 means for standardized and automated reporting 3 improved reliability resilience and integrity of bridge equipment and navigation information 4 integration and presentation of available information in graphical displays received via communication equipment and 5 improved communication of vts service portfolio not limited to vts stations safety and security issues in e navigation are still challenging hahn et al 2016 due to utilization of quite old safety standards e g dcpa and limited means of data transmission off shore among others despite far reaching researches to overcome the challenges still there are some immediate actions that can be done to improve these factors as an example the task no s 4 1 5 in the sip addressing the solution 4 from the list above routing and filtering of information on board weather intended route etc obviously depicts that routing solutions taking into account weather information data predictions etc are considered by imo as e navigation tools benefiting in increasing safety and security of shipping similarly in e maritime an extension of e navigation targeting into commercial utilization of e navigation infrastructure also voyage weather optimization services are included as presented in vanem 2014 ship buoyancy and stability are two main features determining feasibility of any operation in a port or at seaway the buoyancy related problems are relatively simple since not the shape of the submerged hull but rather volume of displaced water needs to be sufficient to support the weight of the ship moreover the system is self regulating and natural draft adjustment is an inherent feature of the fluid floating body interaction obviously the fluctuation of the immersed volume due to waves excitation influences ship dynamics causing heave and other coupled motions this issue is however considered as a part of stability related problems while the strictly considered buoyancy does not create any serious question for a properly loaded intact ship in contrast to the buoyancy the ship stability is a more complex matter it should be considered at both stages the design and during the routine operation even though large amplitudes of ship roll are highly unlikely during cargo handling in a port krata et al 2013 krata 2015 dangerous excessive rolling may happen at seaway kobylinski and kastner 2003 thus the ship stability among others should be addressed by any e navigation solution conventional approach to ship stability is related to the imo stability standards based on the initial metacentric height and several parameters reflecting the shape of the gz curve during years of application of such standards a number of ships experienced some imperfections of the simplified conceptualization fully based on the static righting arm for instance a small lpg tanker capsized near calamata bay in the mediterranean sea in the sixties the capsize took only about 2 min and seven crew members lost their lives a committee of experts found out that a significant aspect of that capsize was the loss of stability especially on wave crest while the righting arm was greatly reduced compared to calm water one pérez rojas et al 2008 such a finding aimed at the importance of dynamic phenomena another example might be a small danish tanker m t edith terkol sailing in the baltic sea near swedish coast in ballast conditions in a stern quartering sea she suddenly capsized after unexpected experiencing of heavy rolling having gz curve complying with the imo standards the later consideration based on model tests and numerical simulations led to the conclusion that coupling between sway yaw and roll motion was the main reason of the disaster causing death of all the crew but two persons kure and bang 1975 one more disaster likely to be at least partly caused by parametrically excited roll motion is capsizing of jan heweliusz ferry pérez rojas et al 2008 however the most commonly known case of parametric rolling and cargo damage experienced by apl china in october 1998 a c11 class post panamax container ship was caught by a severe storm about 400 containers were lost overboard and further hundreds collapsed or crushed during these motions the noticed rolling was as much as 35 40 simultaneously with extreme pitching france et al 2003 in recent years the accident of the container ship svendborg maersk was related to heavy weather damage on 14th of february 2014 dmaib 2014 this case can be found as a trigger for serious interest of fleet operators in dynamic phenomena which are not covered by the intact ship stability criteria recently researches reveal also another dynamical threats related to possible ship instabilities this may occur during the roll transient stage response of a ship sailing in head or following seas the results are obtained on the basic of 4dof equation by means of the analysis of the transient stages with particular interest to the dynamic angle acanfora and cirillo 2017 also the realistic wave group excitation yield a wider instability region compared to regular groups the effects of height variation and period variation are noticed anastopoulos and spyrou 2016 generally there are numerous potentially dangerous dynamical phenomena prone to affect ship safety at sea among them the synchronous roll motion and parametric rolling which can significantly threaten ship s stability are the essential ones they are subjects for research deepening our understanding of both of them bulian 2005 hashimoto et al 2008 backalov et al 2016 however the majority of the mainstream papers deal with the parametric resonance as more challenging and more complex ship response the forward speed is taken into account or zero speed regular or irregular waves and numerous models of roll damping also the cfd technique is increasingly used backalov et al 2016 the common element of all such studies is that the resonance phenomena are strictly related to the nonlinear characteristics of ship roll motion therefore in any practical applications the determination of the natural period of ship s roll is essential one of the authors of this paper has just recently proposed a new reliable prediction method for the natural period of ship s roll reflecting synchronous rolling conditions and influencing parametric rolling wawrzynski and krata 2016b thus this paper aims at applying this prediction method to the ship routing tool including weather information in order to prove correctness of the approach and to present a method improving maritime safety fully complying with e navigation procedures the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the available weather routing approaches emphasizing its multi objective nature then the following section is focused on dynamic constraints in the routing process especially those related to ship motion section 4 elaborates on reliable ship synchronous rolling conditions in terms of equivalent metacentric height calculation gm eq the following section 5 deals with a model of ship speed and fuel consumption section 6 includes example scenarios of the multi objective weather routing tool utilizing gm eq proving usefulness of the proposed synchronous rolling prediction section 7 concludes the material presented 2 weather routing as a multi objective optimization process with dynamic constraints the bridge team activity called weather routing consists of strategic and operational planning and execution of a route usually long range ocean one with regard to various constraints these include combination of environmental limitation ship depending technical goals transportation chain requirements and proper cargo care despite quite simple definition it comprises of numerous relatively complex issues related to ship power supply and propulsion characteristics hull resistance in calm and rough sea ship motions including her rolling weather forecasts utilization algorithms complexity etc perera and guedes soares 2017 a routing method supporting these activities usually takes into account wind or wave forecasts and tries to estimate ship s speed and fuel consumption characteristic in such sea conditions in order to find an optimal or sub optimal passage this optimization problem includes static time independent optimization constraints such as landmasses and shallow waters to be avoided and dynamic ones time dependent i e regions of wind speed exceeding certain value these dynamic constraints make the optimization process difficult and often significantly time consuming however they are the essence without them the process would just be a static route planning one of the first approaches to routing with weather forecast in mind was the isochrone method proposed in james 1957 it was originally a manual procedure based on geometrically determined and recursively defined time fronts isochrones as a simple and straightforward tool it quickly gained extreme popularity developed through decades and moved to a computer application in early 80 s spaans 1986 isochrones or in modified form isopones are still utilized by a part of commercial weather routing software other approaches to the problem include methods based on optimal control theory bijlsma 2008 and dynamic programming in 2d de wit 1990 and 3d versions wei and zhou 2012 there are works utilizing graph approaches the dijkstra algorithm has been successfully applied to ship routing on western pacific montes 2005 indian ocean padhy et al 2008 mediterranean sea mannarini et al 2016 and baltic sea szłapczyński and życzkowski 2017 also direct diving rectangles sampling algorithm looking for the global optimum without utilization of the objective function s gradient has been applied to weather as presented in larsson et al 2015 however due to the fact that these methods might have limited constraint handling possibilities and are usually single objective a number of heuristic multi objective weather routing solutions has also been lately proposed among them the majority of approaches utilize evolutionary algorithms hinnenthal 2007 szlapczynska 2007 marie and courteille 2009 but there are also other heuristics like ant colony optimization tsou and cheng 2013 a review of most of the abovementioned single and multi objective weather routing methods has been presented in walther et al 2016 it is concluded there that selection the most proper weather routing method is strongly dependent of the requirements method s implementation and its final application the method of reliable synchronous roll prediction presented in this paper is applied to a weather routing algorithm with heuristic multi objective approach namely multi objective evolutionary weather routing algorithm mewra in its current version mewra is able to support fully customizable optimization criteria and constraints szlapczynska 2015 one of the mewra s constraint has been configured as msc 1 circ 1228 stability related dynamic constraint krata and szlapczynska 2011 and thus the algorithm is able to fully utilize the new rolling prediction approach proposed here optimization process in mewra comprises of two steps fig 1 the initial set of routes comprising of the great circle rhumb line isochrone route and their combinations is developed during the multi objective able to handle more than one criterion simultaneously evolution this process is supported by numerous operators helping the routes to achieve the assumed set of goals criteria and to fulfill all the requirements constraints the optimization utilizes the notion of pareto optimality a route is said to be pareto optimal non dominated if and only if it is better for at least one criterion than all the other routes and no worse for all the rest of criteria during the evolution a set of non dominated routes pareto optimal routes is collected and updated after each generation when the stopping criterion is fulfilled usually defined by a maximum number of generations the first mewra step is completed and pareto optimal set of routes is available since the set may be numerous it is often recommended to facilitate the user with selecting the most suitable route out of the set this task is performed by the second mewra step in which a multicriteria ranking method sorts the set according to user s preferences towards the optimization criteria this way the first route in the pareto optimal set is the most suitable for the user 3 dynamic constraints in route planning related to ship motion in rough sea the most obvious constraints to be applied in the course of ship route optimization are related to the need for steering clear of land rocks shallow water and other navigational obstructions marked on sea charts moreover also some other restricted areas shall be avoided such as the areas temporarily closed for navigation all the mentioned no go zones are static in short term time independent and they can be relatively easily set up as constraints in the route optimization process however complying with all the static restrictions is yet insufficient in terms of ensuring safety of navigation since during the voyage numerous adverse phenomena are related to seaway conditions and relevant ship response keeping out of shallow waters is simply not enough the ship must control e g her rolling motions and avoid capsizing thus the second group of constraints requires radically different approach than the static no go zones since it ought to comprise quite complex behavior of ship when sailing in rough sea the sea keeping characteristics of the ship are strictly related to her stability nowadays regrettably there is a small connection between route planning being a part of the navigation process and ship stability on the basis of our research we postulate that the process of navigation should be more closely linked to stability of an operated vessel ship stability seems to be one of the key points allowing for further development of optimization in sea navigation numerous works undertaken in xviii century constituted the foundations of the scientific approach towards ship stability and the first stability measures were introduced like the metacentric height the motivation to the invention was as often a disaster of a ship on 9 november 1664 lune carrying huge number of passengers sank two miles to shore in fact the actual cause of her drowning was structural failure but the common perception was that it had been due to poor stability and open gun ports ferreiro 2004 that fostered the serious interest in ship stability especially the metacentric height in following years the righting arm curve was introduced also inspired by a catastrophe well known as monarch s and captain s case later the notion of dynamical stability was worked out as well although those theoretical achievements were not fully applied in sea practice and no stability standards were elaborated kobylinski and kastner 2003 ferreiro 2004 a significant breakthrough in the field of ship stability standardization brought jaakko rahola s dissertation from 1939 it became later the foundation of the intact stability code widely described in the literature womack 2002 kobylinski and kastner 2003 however the gz curve based criteria resolution a 167 es iv and the weather criterion resolution a 562 14 were consolidated into a consistent document called the code on intact stability for all types of ships covered by imo instruments is code numbered the resolution a 749 18 just in 1993 umeda 2008 one could expect the commonly accepted stability standards are effective solution for stability related accidents unfortunately the decades of experience revealed numerous incidents ranging from minor up to catastrophic many of them resulted from dynamic phenomena taking place in rough sea which are not covered by the contemporary stability standards backalov et al 2016 some unfavorable combinations of wave parameters and ship velocity vector may lead to dangerous situations even for vessels complying with the is code kobylinski 2014 the incident from 1998 when post panamax container vessel apl china experienced extreme rolling which caused massive cargo loss opened the discussion and lead to some scientific works on parametric rolling france et al 2003 further investigation based on computer modeling was carried out using nonlinear time domain programs developed by two independent institutions marin and saic both utilized programs predicted rolling between 30 and 40 for the vessel in the head seas encountered pérez rojas et al 2008 since that time the c11 class container vessel is probably the most thoroughly examined hull shape in the world and new researches are still published acanfora et al 2017a 2017b since the c11 hull is known as vulnerable to parametric rolling the next serious cargo damage experienced by the large container vessel svendborg maersk was also assigned to complex dynamic response the 347 m long fully cellular container vessel was bound for far east destination encountering quite heavy weather off the english channel she suddenly and without warning rolled to extreme angles and a large number of cargo containers fell overboard dmaib 2014 according to the further damage report the main reason of the incident was parametric rolling however aside from the instructive and valuable description of this case which can be read in the report there is one more element drawing readers attention i e the reference to the textbook used for training the navigators in denmark frey et al 2002 according to this book bridge officers ought to avoid wave encounter period close to the natural period of the ship roll and half of this period dmaib 2014 which is reasonable according to the present knowledge the problem is that navigators are instructed to obtain the natural period of roll by use of stop watch in calm seas at each departure which is usually unfeasible or alternatively on the basis of imo recommended simplified formula referred later in this paper as formula 1 although the actual natural period of roll may strongly differ from the calculated one when formula 1 is applied therefore the conditions allowing for building up an excessive roll motion due to parametric or synchronous rolling may be significantly different than expected by navigators nowadays wawrzynski and krata 2016a 2016b however the worldwide records evidence only limited number of unambiguous and a few suspected cases of the parametric rolling experienced by large container vessels these ships normally have a large flare in the bow region causing time dependent variations of stability characteristics when sailing in the wave length comparable to the length of the vessel the metacentric height directly depends on the second moment of inertia of the waterplane while the shape and area of the waterplane fluctuates periodically huss 2014 in such a case auto parametrically excited motion may be aroused especially during following seas or head seas courses france et al 2003 the need for coincidence of numerous circumstances explains relatively rare occurrence of parametric rolling the ship hull has to be formed with a large flared region the wave length has to be similar to ship s length the roll dumping coefficient needs to be relatively small being not able to dissipate the provided energy of excitation and the seas have to be following of head directed moreover rather large ships may suffer parametric rolling because this phenomenon is related to high seas typical for strong wind and in such conditions the wave length reaches hundreds meters and the ship length needs to be similar on the other hand the parametric roll can be a more severe phenomenon alas practically possible acanfora et al 2017b according to the literature and mariners experience it may lead to excessive accelerations and inertial loads on ship structure and cargo causing even the breaking of the design working load of a container lashing system acanfora et al 2017a thus despite of the apparently low frequency of the parametric roll this phenomenon is considered in our study in the form of imo circ 1228 based restrictions of the ship speed and course configuration the synchronous rolling of ships unlike the parametric rolling is a part of a routine experience of almost all mariners and all types of ships any ship is vulnerable to synchronous rolling in case of quite close tuning of the exciting period and the natural one so this phenomenon is rather common anyway synchronous rolling rarely causes substantial losses because usually it lasts too short thanks to actions of officers of the watch being aware of the hazard they repress development of the excessive motion just by mistuning usually by change of the ship heading causing a change of wave aspect and as a consequence the encounter frequency alters such operation is a routine on board response to the synchronous rolling however it is only feasible on the spot it would be safer and more efficient to predict in advance ship synchronous rolling and to plan a route in a way enabling complete avoidance of such situations thus application of the dynamic constraints leading to synchronous rolling exclusion may be found as a proactive safety oriented approach one of the significant response of the marine society to the observed shortages of the is code requirements was publishing in 1995 the imo guidance msc circ 707 then far developed and issued in 2007 as imo msc 1 circ 1228 this revised guidance to the master for avoiding dangerous situations in adverse weather and sea conditions is intended to give some help to ship masters when sailing in stormy conditions the relatively up to date publication in comparison to rahola s findings contains a set of remarks and advices regarding the avoidance of following dangerous dynamical phenomena at sea like surf riding and broaching to reduction of intact stability when riding a wave crest amidships synchronous rolling parametric roll motions imo 2007 especially the latter two elements described in imo circ 1228 related to the resonance gain of roll motion play important role in ship route planning issues about two decades ago at the same time when the msc circ 707 was worked out under the pressure of wide criticism of the contemporary stability standards the attempts were started to work out more rational stability criteria covering some typical dynamical phenomena inflicting hazards to ship sailing in rough sea the second generation ship stability criteria were then and still are assumed to be a reply to such demand facing demands for the is code revision the imo started discussion at the slf45 in 2002 since the united states reported that a post panamax containership complying with the is code suffered massive cargo damage due to parametric rolling in head waves the use of model experiments and numerical simulation was proposed to establish the performance based criteria umeda 2008 the second generation regulations are based on the following scenarios of intact stability failures 1 dead ship condition i e ship without forward speed exposed to action of waves and wind 2 pure loss of stability 3 parametric roll 4 surf riding and broaching to 5 excessive accelerations umeda 2008 2013 kobylinski 2014 the results provided by the second generation ship stability criteria are of binary nature likewise the first generation criteria the ship either passes the criteria or not without specifying the safety margin for various loading conditions moreover the discussed criteria can be used only at the design stage of a ship and they are not relevant to ship operation szozda 2014 apart from the roll resonance there is also another element having great impact on ship s stability namely excessive acceleration when a ship has disproportionate gm the natural period of roll becomes very small so that excessive acceleration occurs and may result in injury of crew or cargo damage umeda 2013 the working group recommended use of operational limitation from the level 2 criterion however the final proposal including the level 3 is still open umeda 2013 one of the available methods for increasing ship safety due to operational limitations is the use of numerical tools to simulate ship response in a wide range of conditions in such case the polar diagrams of maximum acceptable significant wave height versus the seaway period and wave direction for different speeds and load cases are prepared backalov et al 2016 the problem of excessive acceleration needs to be emphasized since the approach to ocean route planning presented in this paper deals with avoidance of such acceleration as well expected implementation of the second generation stability criteria shall notably improve the known shortages of the present standards in terms of relevant modeling of the dynamical phenomena the result of ship stability assessment provides supportive information to naval architect at the design stage nowadays one of the assumption formulated at the beginning of work under the second generation ship stability standards was that the design criteria should be supplemented with operational criteria umeda 2008 this postulate is not executed yet thus second generation ship stability criteria cannot be directly applied on board and utilized by the route planning and its optimization processes today actually the most reasonable approach towards coupling of ship stability performance and weather routing optimization seems to be meeting the intact stability code requirements which are obligatory and additionally applying the msc 1 circ 1228 recommendations non obligatory as a dynamic set of route planning optimization constraints the term dynamic constraints refers to constraints which vary in short time typically according to wind force and direction wave parameters ship speed and course there are numerous software tools designed to help navigators to calculate the restricted ship courses according to the revised guidance to the master for avoiding dangerous situations in adverse weather and sea conditions benedict et al 2014 ami seaware octopus onboard the authors of this paper have prepared their own implementation of msc 1 circ 1228 restricted courses which has been used in the previous work dealing with weather routing optimization krata and szlapczynska 2011 results of a sample calculation are shown in fig 2 where the potentially dangerous zones are depictured for a ship 113 m in length over all 106 m between perpendiculars and 18 9 m wide the actual draft of the vessel corresponding with the assumed in this paper sample loading conditions applied in route optimization algorithm equals 7 29 m the software generating the restricted zones according to msc 1 circ 1228 was run for two different metacentric heights equal gm 1 0 60 m and gm 2 0 98 m the value of gm 2 was created by increasing the gm 1 by 64 which reflects the equivalent metacentric height resulting from the actual shape of the ship gz curve rationale for this modification is provided in the next section of the paper and fig 3 and in krata and wawrzynski 2017b according to the guidance msc 1 circ 1228 there are some restricted zones which should be understood as the ship speed and course configuration not recommended due to actual possibility of dangerous dynamic phenomena occurrence one of the zones reflects surf riding and broaching risk another one successive high wave attack which is really not that common and the most important zone shows the resonance prospect it has to be emphasized that the resonance possibility is strictly related to the ship stability characteristics which may be clearly seen in fig 2 presenting the results obtained for the same ship with the same displacement but for two different values of the metacentric height since the calculation presented in fig 2 is relatively straightforward and the general algorithm does not cause noteworthy problems one may ask whether there is a scientific issue worth mentioning and studying to point out clearly the core matter of this research we need to mention about the resonance mode of ship rolling this may occur due to nonlinearity of ship response in resonance conditions i e when the encounter wave frequency is similar to first or eventually second harmonic frequency of natural roll motion of a ship landrini 2006 the prevention against synchronous rolling consists in avoiding such combinations of ship speed and course which result in the encounter wave period t e nearly equal to the natural rolling period of a ship τ t e τ in order to prevent parametric rolling the encounter period should be neither close to the natural rolling period of a ship nor one to half of this period t e τ t e 0 5 τ imo 2007 bearing in mind the crucial role played by ship s natural period of roll we shall consider the factors governing this period the simple method for calculation of the rolling period τ is given in the intact stability code and it is recommended for on board use in absence of sufficient information however the lack of reliable sufficient information is almost permanent the formula based on the initial metacentric height of a ship is imo 2008 1 τ 2 c b g m with the value of c coefficient c 0 373 0 023 b d 0 043 l 100 where c is the coefficient describing ships transverse gyration radius gm denotes the initial metacentric height b denotes ship s breadth and l denotes ship s length at waterline d is mean ship s draft actually the radius of gyration equals c b where c is the dimensionless coefficient to be multiplied by ship s breadth given in meters for a particular ship the only variable values in formula 1 are the metacentric height gm and the draft d the latter depends on her weight and hull s geometry so it is determined and constant for the particular loading condition the initial metacentric height is also determined by the distance between the vertical center of gravity and the initial metacentric point elevation if so the metacentric height also seems to be constant although the initial metacentric height is valid for small angles of ship heel while the potentially dangerous amplitudes of roll are far larger than the range of small angles of heel this is the reason why the natural period of roll of any ship depends in fact on her amplitude of roll and it is not steady as may be erroneously and hastily found wawrzynski and krata 2016a actually the natural period of roll may vary significantly depending on the amplitude of roll due to large range of variation of the equivalent metacentric height governing this period krata and wawrzynski 2017a thus a more reliable method for ship natural period of roll estimation should be applied in the msc 1 circ 1228 based algorithm for restricted courses calculation and subsequently in the weather routing optimization algorithm 4 reliable modeling of ship resonance mode of rolling the comprehensive study on ship natural period of roll estimation was carried out by wawrzynski and krata 2016b the approach is based on the nonlinear roll equation with special attention put on nonlinearity of gz curve generally the linear roll equation can model the synchronous rolling for small amplitudes it is widely assumed that the approximation for large angles is also quite fine which is true in case of some shapes of gz curve anyway the accuracy drops significantly for strongly nonlinear gz curves so in such cases the nonlinear righting moment utilized in the roll equation produces more precise results on large amplitude responses parametric roll being a much more complex phenomenon cannot be modeled by 1dof linear equation at all the assumption lying behind the elaborated method for predicting the natural period of ship s roll is to maintain the balance between accuracy and simplicity of the formula in the final onboard application the method is actually based on the differential equation of ship 1dof motion nonetheless its application in practice does not require solving such equation it is demonstrated in wawrzynski and krata 2016b that period of roll can be practically obtained according to the formula 2 τ ϕ a 2 c b g m e q ϕ a where the value of c coefficient remains the same as given in formula 1 and gm eq ϕ a denotes the equivalent value of the transverse metacentric height of the ship for a specified amplitude of roll ϕ a numerical simulations performed for numerous ships in different loading conditions have indicated the following two essential factors influencing variations of the rolling period 1 the area under gz curve from an angle of heel equal to zero up to the rolling amplitude 2 the average inclination of the tangent line to the gz curve from zero up to the rolling amplitude the proposed formula is based on both observed features and it is the following wawrzynski and krata 2016a 3 g m e q ϕ a 0 ϕ a g z ϕ d ϕ ϕ a 2 g z ϕ a 2 ϕ a where gz ϕ is the righting arm at the angle of heel equals ϕ and ϕ a is the actual amplitude of roll as it can be clearly seen the equivalent value of the metacentric height depends on the shape of the gz curve and on the amplitude of roll wawrzynski and krata 2016a thus for the sample loading condition of the previously considered general cargo vessel this equivalent metacentric height is calculated for a wide range of amplitudes of roll the ninth order polynomial power series with only odd powers is applied to accurately approximate the actual gz curve the result of computation carried out according to formula 3 and the corresponding gz curve are shown in fig 3 the sample gz curve of the considered vessel is rather typical thus the research results presented in the sixth section would show some more general trends nevertheless the equivalent metacentric height which is used in the course of the natural period of ship roll calculation varies significantly the extreme variation of gm eq reaches 64 of the initial value so it must affect the natural period of ship roll significantly formula 2 influence of the noticed progressive stiffening of considered ship gz curve on the restricted zones location is presented earlier in fig 2 the noteworthy variation of the equivalent metacentric height of the considered vessel causing even doubling of the initial gm value is something to think about seriously the question is whether such a result is rather accidental one or maybe it is typical for many different types of cargo ships to assess this crucial matter a series of calculations was carried out aiming at the typical loading conditions of numerous cargo vessels six different ships were taken into account to cover a variety of ship purpose their different particulars and loading condition from ballast up to fully loaded ones the main particulars of considered ships are given in table 1 table 1 refers to ships taken into account in the course of the proposed method validation the natural period of roll was calculated according to formulae 2 and 3 and then to compare the results with the use of roll equation four different loading conditions of each ship were considered to cover the realistic range of draft fourth and fifth columns of table 1 and typical initial metacentric heights for each ship type sixth and seventh columns of table 1 the range of obtained variation of the equivalent metacentric height is shown in last two columns of table 1 the given values reflect minimum and maximum variation of gm obtained throughout all considered cases for every ship so these values are not assigned to the minimum or maximum draft the conducted validation allows for further use of the proposed method for predicting the natural period of ship s roll since it was assessed as reliable comparing to the results of simulations based on roll equation with regard to nonlinearity of gz curve the method performs similarly or sometimes more accurately than the one proposed earlier in contento et al 1996 but is much more versatile in terms of the righting arm curve approximation it allows any approximating formula or even a set of discrete values of the gz which is appreciable a more sophisticated approach to gz can be found in bulian 2005 the analytical formula describing the righting arm with regard to wave profile is developed and applied in 1 5dof motion equation such an approach is more realistic however the method expressed by formulae 2 and 3 seems to be sufficient in the light of recent results of 6dof simulations performed with the use of laidyn software the predominant period of synchronous roll of the c11 container vessel obtained for jonswap wave spectrum fairly converged to the value predicted with the use of formulae 2 and 3 acanfora et al 2017b especially that work may be found as a justification of the proposed formulae application since the results obtained with the use of well benchmarked laidyn code were directly compared to the natural roll frequency calculated according to formulae 2 and 3 despite the 1dof model of rolling and the regular wave system behind these formulae they are effective also for irregular wave system which is more closely to the real one in rough sea conditions than regular one thus bearing in mind the simplified nature of the applied formulae 2 and 3 we find this method as capable to contribute the acceptable accuracy of the natural roll period prediction for the purpose of practical application of the revised guidance to the master in irregular sea conditions if so both synchronous rolling and parametric resonance are covered by the proposed approach as truthful as the applied guidance allows since the proposed method has been found as reliable the assessment of its significance is required in order to set down whether its application produces a noteworthy difference in gm values and as a consequence in locations of stability related dangerous zones krata and wawrzynski 2017a 2017b a wide range of possible amplitudes of roll was taken into account the performed series of calculations have shown that the equivalent value of the metacentric height varies significantly according to the amplitude of roll this is typical for all considered vessels however the variation of the gm eq value comparing to the initial gm ranges from 10 up to even 169 see results in table 1 with the mean value equal to 58 which is significant in terms of synchronous roll prediction the described method for reliable modeling of ship natural period of roll and as a consequence of the resonance roll prediction enables the application of trustworthy set of dynamic constraints to the route planning algorithm in the two following sections results of route optimization performed with the use of this method are presented preceded by the ship model description 5 modeling of ship speed and fuel consumption the ship considered in this study for optimization purposes is a representative of japanese built series of double decker general dry cargo vessels of rather small size the main parameters are length overall loa 113 m length between perpendiculars lbp 106 m breadth b 18 9 m extreme draft summer 8 54 m winter 8 36 m deadweight 9595 t gross tonnage 6030 net tonnage 3602 she is equipped with two deck cranes capable to heave up to 50 tons the ship propulsion utilizes a two stroke main engine supplying power to a single screw propeller declared fuel consumption is 15 0 tons a day at a contract speed 12 5 kn plus light fuel diesel consumption reaching 1 0 ton a day in port idle and 2 0 tons a day in port when working no diesel at sea is consumed with shaft generator working however such general data are insufficiently precise for the purpose of performed optimization reliable modeling of ship speed and fuel consumption in various weather conditions is essential regardless the adopted route finding method considering difficulties and potential sources of inadequacies of the theoretical models the fuel consumption and particular speed value in any weather and sea conditions are calculated with the use of a mathematical model based on numerous reports from the real operation of the model vessel such an empirical model dedicated to the particular ship class with co operation of the ship operators has been built in order to achieve this task a questionnaire has been prepared and distributed among chiefs and captains of the available ships of the considered class further processing of data related to speed and fuel consumption has been mainly based on the collected questionnaires there are two main sets of variables governing ship speed and fuel consumption namely meteo marine conditions and ship construction with special attention to energetic efficiency thus the questionnaires have asked about wind speed and direction predominant wave height and direction wave length ship displacement and trim ship speed through the water shaft revolutions shaft generator status fuel consumption the number of collected reports equals 244 and they are the basis for mathematical model of speed the performed analysis shows that the main factors influencing the ship speed are wind speed and relative direction and wave height these elements are introduced to the model and the coefficients are fitted to obtain the least square errors the resultant model of the ship speed is shown in fig 4 left plot based on the reported ship speed gathered in the questionnaires fig 4 right plot according to the collected reports the engine load is maintained at about 90 level to obtain typical cruise speed without excessive forcing of machinery the brake specific fuel consumption remains almost in the minimum plateau region which allows for economical navigation fig 5 the reported shaft revolutions are 170 rev min in almost all cases and rarely 169 rev min which is assumed as the same setting of the main engine heavy conditions due to severe stormy weather would certainly impose the engine load reduction however such situation is not modeled since one of the crucial aims of the proposed weather routing is to avoid the stormy weather at all so slow steaming is disregarded at the present stage of algorithm development the performed analysis of the reports has revealed that the fuel consumption at the economical setting of main engine corresponding to 170 rev min does not practically depend on the weather conditions therefore we set the steady fuel consumption per hour however the distance run on every ton of fuel obviously depends on ship speed and automatically on meteo marine conditions such model of fuel consumption would be invalid for heavy conditions but it does not affect the presented study since stormy weather is avoided according to the assumed constraints of the optimization algorithm 6 impact of gm eq variation on optimal ship routing to demonstrate possible application of the dynamical stability related constraints in weather routing and to verify how introducing the reliable predictions of synchronous rolling would affect ship performance a simulation environment has been built based on mewra weather routing tool szlapczynska 2015 a comparison between gm initial and gm eq has been made for two routing scenarios in north atlantic ocean waters both scenarios assume voyages with the same origin and destination points from bahamas to gibraltar but during different seasons the scenarios have been simulated by mewra tool utilizing weather predictions for north atlantic ocean downloaded from navsim ltd weather server table 2 presents the ship model parameters and table 3 the basic evolutionary parameters utilized by mewra in these scenarios the weather forecasts taken into account in the course of the optimization process include wind parameters speed and direction while wave conditions are interpolated based on these wind predictions facing some difficulties in wave field forecast availability for the sake of algorithm presentation we decided to approximate wave parameters on the basis of wind forecast the fully developed wave system is considered which is a simplification and the wave direction is assumed to be wind alike in case of wave forecast accessibility the algorithm automatically switches into the forecast utilization the following subsections present mewra optimization suite two experiments scenario 1 2 for comparison between gm initial and gm eq and scenarios data post processing with results discussion 6 1 multiobjective evolutionary weather routing algorithm mewra mewra is a heuristic optimization algorithm customized for weather routing purposes supporting multiple criteria and constraints it has been integrated with naviweather enc class software naviweather 2017 by navsim ltd for the purpose of this research mewra includes the following optimization criteria cost criterion to be minimized benefit criteria to be maximized 1 passage time of a route cost criterion 2 total fuel consumption for a route cost criterion 3 safety of passage associated with a route benefit criterion safety is modeled by a dimensionless index with value in 0 0 1 0 range where 0 0 depicts absolutely unsafe route and 1 0 ideally safe one the index is based on averaged fractional safety index values computed separately for each segment between control points of the route moreover mewra s optimization constraint set includes the following elements static constraints are time independent while dynamic ones are time dependent 1 landmass and shoal waters encountered en route static constraint 2 wind speed exceeding 55 kn encountered en route dynamic constraint 3 stability related regions violating msc 1 circ 1228 encountered en route dynamic constraint with sub regions of a surf riding or broaching to b successive high wave attack c roll resonance in terms of both synchronous and parametric rolling since the predictions of rolling described in section 4 have direct influence on resonance regions constraint 3c implementation of formula 3 has been applied to mewra s imo1228 constraint thus mewra is now able to check the constraint in gm initial constant value of the gm equal to the initial gm through the whole routing process or gm eq mode gm value changing for each route s control point depending of current wave conditions since the gm eq based approach requires the estimation of expected amplitude of the ship roll the 1dof roll equation is adopted wawrzynski and krata 2016a 4 ϕ 2 μ ϕ g r x 2 g z ϕ ξ w c o s ω e t where μ is the damping coefficient g is the gravity acceleration r x is the gyration radius of a ship and added masses e g dragged water which is assumed to be constant for the sake of simplicity and calculated according to the imo recommended simplified formula 1 gz is the righting arm ξ w means the exciting moment coefficient and ω e denotes the frequency of the exciting moment due to waves the integration of equation 4 is performed with the use of runge kutta method initially prepared in matlab and then transferred to the main optimization algorithm the wave system applied in this study is regular so the solution of the roll equation is deterministic for every encounter wave characteristic the 1dof formula 4 is not capable to cover such complex modes of motion like parametric resonance surf riding broaching etc however it is not intended to be capable in this research the only expected functionality of this equation is to facilitate estimation of the amplitude of roll to utilize it in formula 3 enabling the equivalent metacentric height computation then the gm eq is further processed in the course of the route optimization as the key element of the dynamic constraints set 6 2 scenario 1 caribbean bahamas to europe gibraltar departure 27 09 2013 03 00 gmt the weather forecast for the first day of voyage was favorable fig 6 the downwind sailing with moderate wind speed let expect economical fuel consumption at a good speed however the following and quartering seas could potentially expose the ship to hazardous dynamic phenomena which needs to be assessed in the course of optimization process such conditions persisted till october the first when the wind direction gradually turned clockwise and the wind speed significantly dropped at the end of the voyage the beam relative wind direction was prevailing the potential synchronous rolling has to be assessed in mewra environment working in either gm inital or gm eq mode switched in the configuration pareto optimal routes have been sought for route bahamas gibraltar departure date 27th sept 2013 03 00 gmt figs 7 and 8 present pareto optimal sets obtained for gm inital and gm eq respectively best routes separately for each mode in figs 9 and 10 respectively have been selected by mewra out of the pareto sets based on the following criteria weights passage time 0 5 fuel consumption 0 2 safety of passage 0 3 a comparison of best routes parameters obtained for the scenario in gm initial and gm eq modes is presented in table 4 the results presented in table 4 reveal that the resulting best routes in gm initial and gm eq differ in their basic parameters time fuel and safety but only very slightly differences around 0 1 location of control points for both the best routes is also quite similar figs 9 and 10 as it is depicted by the number of pareto optimal routes the gm eq mode is in this case more restrictive which is also confirmed by the increasing number of route exclusions due to resonance eliminating the routes due to violation of imo1228 constraint as it may be noted the total number of imo1228 exclusions may be significantly greater than the total number of routes here 5000 this is due to the fact that a single route may be imo 1228 excluded as unfeasible for the imo 1228 constraint multiple times before it gets fixed made feasible when comparing mewra results obtained for gm initial and gm eq modes one should not focus on analysis of global route parameters such as passage time or fuel consumption but rather on verifying if applying gm eq so varying gm value during voyage depending of the weather conditions has impact on feasibility of the route defined by location in space and time of route s control points when compared with gm initial a constant gm value for the whole voyage one can easily imagine that a route either pareto optimal or not found in the gm initial mode could not be assumed feasible thus safe if a more reliable rolling prediction would be applied as in gm eq mode in order to perform such analysis a series of mewra route data for the same scenario and weather data is required this kind of result comparison for scenario 1 will be presented later in section 5 3 6 3 scenario 2 caribbean bahamas to europe gibraltar departure 25 02 2017 03 00 gmt according to the weather forecast the wind direction was generally adverse fig 11 although the great circle voyage requiring proceeding northward could allow the ship for wind and seas remaining closer to beam direction however from march the fourth till the sixth the deep low built up in the north atlantic with counter clockwise air mass circulation generated noteworthy wave field which could cause heavy rolling of the ship from march the seventh the wind speed dropped at the end of the voyage the ship could expect moderate to low wind speed and corresponding seas coming from port side beam in mewra environment working again in either gm inital or gm eq mode switched in the configuration pareto optimal routes have been sought for the same as in scenario 1 route bahamas gibraltar but different departure date now 25th feb 2017 03 00 gmt figs 12 and 13 present pareto optimal sets obtained in scenario 2 for gm inital and gm eq respectively best routes separately for each mode in figs 14 and 15 respectively have been selected by mewra out of the pareto sets based on the same weight configuration as in scenario 1 a comparison of best routes parameters obtained for the scenario in gm initial and gm eq modes is presented in table 5 as presented in table 5 the resulting best routes in gm initial and gm eq still differ in their basic parameters time fuel and safety and geographical locations figs 14 and 15 only in a subtle way as it is depicted by the number of pareto optimal routes and number of route exclusions due to resonance the gm initial mode is in this case more restrictive as presented in scenario 1 the total number of imo1228 exclusions may be significantly greater than the total number of routes here 5000 again as in scenario 1 a systematic series of tests is required to compare feasibility of the routes found in both modes the next section addresses this issue also for data from the scenario 2 6 4 data post processing and results discussion the main reason for data post processing was to perform a series of tests for routes either pareto optimal or not generated by mewra in order to compare their performance in terms of their feasibility for both modes gm initial and gm eq and both scenarios presented in the two previous sub sections thus for scenario 1 and 2 the mewra s logfiles has been parsed and all the ship routes created through the evolution have been post processed two scenarios and separate route sets for gm initial and gm eq mode for one mode 2 scenarios 50 generations 100 routes in generation 10 000 routes which gives 20 000 as total number of processed routes for both gm initial and gm eq modes for each route it has been noted whether it was originally feasible that is if all the assumed optimization constraints have been met for the route the original feasibility has been stated for given weather data predictions either sept 2013 or feb 2017 and given gm initial gm eq mode thus in post processing each route has been once more uploaded to mewra and verified two times to check if is feasible using gm initial and gm eq modes weather data predictions appropriate to given scenario have been used the idea is to compare if the original feasibility of each route equals to the post processed feasibility in all cases when the same gm initial gm eq mode has been utilized for the original and post processed feasibility the results have been equal in 100 of cases which confirms correctness of the approach table 6 presents the results obtained for mixed gm initial gm eq modes utilized in comparison of the original and post processed routes feasibility inequalities in feasibility for both scenarios have been presented in detail in table 7 introduction of the gm eq mode resulted in different feasibility assessment for some routes in the set in all the cases however percentage of the routes with different original and post processed feasibility table 6 vary from over 10 down to 0 7 as revealed by table 7 there is also no explicit pattern for gm initial to gm eq transition in some cases scenario 1 2 in gm eq gm initial the gm eq is stricter and does not allow for routes feasible in gm initial while in cases of scenario 1 2 in gm initial gm eq it is less restrictive than gm initial the number of routes varying upon the applied version of the metacentric height e g gm initial or gm eq is not massive according to the obtained results tables 6 and 7 this creates the question if the application of the proposed dynamic constraints based on the equivalent metacentric height is justified there are additional calculations needed in the tested approach and moreover the estimation of the amplitude of roll is required to address this problem we need to consider the characteristics of the gm variation which is earlier shown in fig 3 both the initial and the equivalent metacentric heights are almost equal for the small amplitudes of roll therefore the routes planned in the conditions exciting only gentle rolling are nearly the same the better the weather the smaller differences between routes can be noticed regardless the version of the metacentric height taken into account in the course of route optimization however for larger amplitudes of roll the value of the equivalent metacentric height significantly differs comparing to the initial one thus the cases with quite heavy weather reveal the variety of optimization results which is presented in tables 6 and 7 although it needs to be emphasized that the wind speed and the sea state are not the only variables influencing these differences in resultant routes the wave aspect the angle of wave attack plays a vital role as well since the synchronous roll or the parametric roll of the ship may occur in case of well tuning of the wave encounter frequency and the natural frequency of roll anyway without the wind and sea being strong enough the dangerous rolling cannot develop in the light of such explanation we state that the application of the dynamic constraints based on the equivalent metacentric height of the ship is justified despite the number of routes affected by the substitution of the gm initial by the gm eq these cases are crucial for safety of navigation since they reflect the heavier rolling of the ship and the largest risk for cargo damage or maybe even the ship capsizing potentially incorrect restrictions which could be taken into account due to the invalid application of the initial metacentric height for large amplitudes of roll instead of gmeq producing correct resonance prediction can mislead the crew exposing the ship to excessive motion and undue accelerations 7 summary and conclusions in ship weather routing the optimization goal is usually defined as finding a compromise between voyage economic costs and safety and security of the ship crew passengers and cargo ship stability issues including modeling of the rolling motion are obviously of significant importance when safety measures are evaluated this paper presents how application of the reliable modeling of ship synchronous rolling conditions influences when applied the weather routing process the equivalent metacentric height gm eq is utilized in the optimal route finding process and evaluated in comparison to the initial metacentric height gm initial in the routing process a dynamic optimization constraint checking routes compliance with msc 1 circ 1228 utilizes either gm eq or gm initial for further synchronous rolling predictions application of the gm initial approach for calculating the ship s natural period of roll may lead to dangerous situations of experiencing unexpected large amplitudes of roll due to synchronous or parametric rolling in case of prompt and effective action of an officer on watch this may at least force the ship to change its course which is economically inefficient such situation is especially likely to occur to ships with strongly nonlinear characteristics of gz curve i e in the range of possible rolling amplitudes quite common when the maximum of the gz curve is located at the relatively small angles of heel for instance about 30 generally two potential scenarios are possible when initial gm is used 1 the calculated natural period of roll diverges from the actual one erroneously leading the ship to avoid configurations of speed and course within a safe range which needlessly strains the operator s budget 2 and vice versa the ship falsely avoids configurations of speed and course within a safe range exposing herself to real danger due to the unexpected tuning of actual natural period of roll with the encountered period of wave the new method based on gm eq unlike the gm initial one enables credible foreseeing of the real value of the period of roll which allows for safe and economically efficient navigation as depicted by the research results the newly proposed approach utilizing varying value of gm eq instead of a constant value of gm initial to multi objective weather routing brings about significant changes to the resulting pareto optimal set of routes factor of the changes depends of the weather conditions especially wave height and direction however it is concluded that in some cases even more than 10 of considered routes may be differently evaluated by the multi objective optimization algorithm due to gm initial to gm eq exchange alone thus it is justified and recommended to promote further research on this very promising approach to develop in the future ship routing software aiming at more precise and reliable route recommendations acknowledgements a part of this research has been supported by navsim

23628,ship routing process taking into account weather conditions is a constrained multi objective optimization problem and it should consider various optimization criteria and constraints formulation of a stability related dynamic route optimization constraint is presented in this paper one of the key objectives of a cross ocean sailing is finding a compromise between ship safety and economics of operation this compromise should be taken into account by the planning procedure and proper optimization algorithm in this research complex stability related phenomena are adopted as the basis for the constraint set formulation in weather routing thus the synchronous roll parametric resonance surf riding and broaching to are considered according to the imo msc 1 circ 1228 guidance however the dangerous resonance motion of the ship depends on her natural period of roll and a degree of tuning to the encounter wave period this natural period strictly depends on the gz curve shape and consequently on the amplitude of roll in order to properly model the natural period of roll a new method utilizing equivalent metacentric height is applied and incorporated into the route optimization sample calculations of the cross ocean routes are presented and the effect of the dynamic approach to the constraint set is demonstrated and discussed keywords weather routing multi objective constrained optimization ship synchronous rolling resonance frequency of rolling equivalent metacentric height natural period of ship roll 1 introduction decision support tools utilizing intelligent technologies experience rapid growth and find numerous application in maritime related fields nowadays one of the hottest paradigms in the maritime traffic management is e navigation strictly linked to such modern technologies this paradigm has been defined by the international maritime organization imo already in 2005 stating that imo 2005 e navigation is expected to provide digital information and infrastructure for the benefit of maritime safety security and protection of the marine environment reducing the administrative burden and increasing the efficiency of maritime trade and transport in practice it is going to be implemented as an integration of existing and new electronic telecommunication and computer based digital services supporting ship navigation processes common maritime data structure cmds lays beneath the core e navigation concept as its data model covers all aspects of the shipping and maritime domain however there are already proposals to extend cmds towards a universal marine information registry jonas and oltmann 2013 the main purpose of e navigation is to increase safety and efficiency of maritime transportation patraiko 2007 in 2014 imo has prepared e navigation strategy implementation plan sip imo 2014 the sip includes tasks defined for five prioritized solutions required for a successful e navigation implementation and deployment namely 1 improved harmonized and user friendly bridge design 2 means for standardized and automated reporting 3 improved reliability resilience and integrity of bridge equipment and navigation information 4 integration and presentation of available information in graphical displays received via communication equipment and 5 improved communication of vts service portfolio not limited to vts stations safety and security issues in e navigation are still challenging hahn et al 2016 due to utilization of quite old safety standards e g dcpa and limited means of data transmission off shore among others despite far reaching researches to overcome the challenges still there are some immediate actions that can be done to improve these factors as an example the task no s 4 1 5 in the sip addressing the solution 4 from the list above routing and filtering of information on board weather intended route etc obviously depicts that routing solutions taking into account weather information data predictions etc are considered by imo as e navigation tools benefiting in increasing safety and security of shipping similarly in e maritime an extension of e navigation targeting into commercial utilization of e navigation infrastructure also voyage weather optimization services are included as presented in vanem 2014 ship buoyancy and stability are two main features determining feasibility of any operation in a port or at seaway the buoyancy related problems are relatively simple since not the shape of the submerged hull but rather volume of displaced water needs to be sufficient to support the weight of the ship moreover the system is self regulating and natural draft adjustment is an inherent feature of the fluid floating body interaction obviously the fluctuation of the immersed volume due to waves excitation influences ship dynamics causing heave and other coupled motions this issue is however considered as a part of stability related problems while the strictly considered buoyancy does not create any serious question for a properly loaded intact ship in contrast to the buoyancy the ship stability is a more complex matter it should be considered at both stages the design and during the routine operation even though large amplitudes of ship roll are highly unlikely during cargo handling in a port krata et al 2013 krata 2015 dangerous excessive rolling may happen at seaway kobylinski and kastner 2003 thus the ship stability among others should be addressed by any e navigation solution conventional approach to ship stability is related to the imo stability standards based on the initial metacentric height and several parameters reflecting the shape of the gz curve during years of application of such standards a number of ships experienced some imperfections of the simplified conceptualization fully based on the static righting arm for instance a small lpg tanker capsized near calamata bay in the mediterranean sea in the sixties the capsize took only about 2 min and seven crew members lost their lives a committee of experts found out that a significant aspect of that capsize was the loss of stability especially on wave crest while the righting arm was greatly reduced compared to calm water one pérez rojas et al 2008 such a finding aimed at the importance of dynamic phenomena another example might be a small danish tanker m t edith terkol sailing in the baltic sea near swedish coast in ballast conditions in a stern quartering sea she suddenly capsized after unexpected experiencing of heavy rolling having gz curve complying with the imo standards the later consideration based on model tests and numerical simulations led to the conclusion that coupling between sway yaw and roll motion was the main reason of the disaster causing death of all the crew but two persons kure and bang 1975 one more disaster likely to be at least partly caused by parametrically excited roll motion is capsizing of jan heweliusz ferry pérez rojas et al 2008 however the most commonly known case of parametric rolling and cargo damage experienced by apl china in october 1998 a c11 class post panamax container ship was caught by a severe storm about 400 containers were lost overboard and further hundreds collapsed or crushed during these motions the noticed rolling was as much as 35 40 simultaneously with extreme pitching france et al 2003 in recent years the accident of the container ship svendborg maersk was related to heavy weather damage on 14th of february 2014 dmaib 2014 this case can be found as a trigger for serious interest of fleet operators in dynamic phenomena which are not covered by the intact ship stability criteria recently researches reveal also another dynamical threats related to possible ship instabilities this may occur during the roll transient stage response of a ship sailing in head or following seas the results are obtained on the basic of 4dof equation by means of the analysis of the transient stages with particular interest to the dynamic angle acanfora and cirillo 2017 also the realistic wave group excitation yield a wider instability region compared to regular groups the effects of height variation and period variation are noticed anastopoulos and spyrou 2016 generally there are numerous potentially dangerous dynamical phenomena prone to affect ship safety at sea among them the synchronous roll motion and parametric rolling which can significantly threaten ship s stability are the essential ones they are subjects for research deepening our understanding of both of them bulian 2005 hashimoto et al 2008 backalov et al 2016 however the majority of the mainstream papers deal with the parametric resonance as more challenging and more complex ship response the forward speed is taken into account or zero speed regular or irregular waves and numerous models of roll damping also the cfd technique is increasingly used backalov et al 2016 the common element of all such studies is that the resonance phenomena are strictly related to the nonlinear characteristics of ship roll motion therefore in any practical applications the determination of the natural period of ship s roll is essential one of the authors of this paper has just recently proposed a new reliable prediction method for the natural period of ship s roll reflecting synchronous rolling conditions and influencing parametric rolling wawrzynski and krata 2016b thus this paper aims at applying this prediction method to the ship routing tool including weather information in order to prove correctness of the approach and to present a method improving maritime safety fully complying with e navigation procedures the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the available weather routing approaches emphasizing its multi objective nature then the following section is focused on dynamic constraints in the routing process especially those related to ship motion section 4 elaborates on reliable ship synchronous rolling conditions in terms of equivalent metacentric height calculation gm eq the following section 5 deals with a model of ship speed and fuel consumption section 6 includes example scenarios of the multi objective weather routing tool utilizing gm eq proving usefulness of the proposed synchronous rolling prediction section 7 concludes the material presented 2 weather routing as a multi objective optimization process with dynamic constraints the bridge team activity called weather routing consists of strategic and operational planning and execution of a route usually long range ocean one with regard to various constraints these include combination of environmental limitation ship depending technical goals transportation chain requirements and proper cargo care despite quite simple definition it comprises of numerous relatively complex issues related to ship power supply and propulsion characteristics hull resistance in calm and rough sea ship motions including her rolling weather forecasts utilization algorithms complexity etc perera and guedes soares 2017 a routing method supporting these activities usually takes into account wind or wave forecasts and tries to estimate ship s speed and fuel consumption characteristic in such sea conditions in order to find an optimal or sub optimal passage this optimization problem includes static time independent optimization constraints such as landmasses and shallow waters to be avoided and dynamic ones time dependent i e regions of wind speed exceeding certain value these dynamic constraints make the optimization process difficult and often significantly time consuming however they are the essence without them the process would just be a static route planning one of the first approaches to routing with weather forecast in mind was the isochrone method proposed in james 1957 it was originally a manual procedure based on geometrically determined and recursively defined time fronts isochrones as a simple and straightforward tool it quickly gained extreme popularity developed through decades and moved to a computer application in early 80 s spaans 1986 isochrones or in modified form isopones are still utilized by a part of commercial weather routing software other approaches to the problem include methods based on optimal control theory bijlsma 2008 and dynamic programming in 2d de wit 1990 and 3d versions wei and zhou 2012 there are works utilizing graph approaches the dijkstra algorithm has been successfully applied to ship routing on western pacific montes 2005 indian ocean padhy et al 2008 mediterranean sea mannarini et al 2016 and baltic sea szłapczyński and życzkowski 2017 also direct diving rectangles sampling algorithm looking for the global optimum without utilization of the objective function s gradient has been applied to weather as presented in larsson et al 2015 however due to the fact that these methods might have limited constraint handling possibilities and are usually single objective a number of heuristic multi objective weather routing solutions has also been lately proposed among them the majority of approaches utilize evolutionary algorithms hinnenthal 2007 szlapczynska 2007 marie and courteille 2009 but there are also other heuristics like ant colony optimization tsou and cheng 2013 a review of most of the abovementioned single and multi objective weather routing methods has been presented in walther et al 2016 it is concluded there that selection the most proper weather routing method is strongly dependent of the requirements method s implementation and its final application the method of reliable synchronous roll prediction presented in this paper is applied to a weather routing algorithm with heuristic multi objective approach namely multi objective evolutionary weather routing algorithm mewra in its current version mewra is able to support fully customizable optimization criteria and constraints szlapczynska 2015 one of the mewra s constraint has been configured as msc 1 circ 1228 stability related dynamic constraint krata and szlapczynska 2011 and thus the algorithm is able to fully utilize the new rolling prediction approach proposed here optimization process in mewra comprises of two steps fig 1 the initial set of routes comprising of the great circle rhumb line isochrone route and their combinations is developed during the multi objective able to handle more than one criterion simultaneously evolution this process is supported by numerous operators helping the routes to achieve the assumed set of goals criteria and to fulfill all the requirements constraints the optimization utilizes the notion of pareto optimality a route is said to be pareto optimal non dominated if and only if it is better for at least one criterion than all the other routes and no worse for all the rest of criteria during the evolution a set of non dominated routes pareto optimal routes is collected and updated after each generation when the stopping criterion is fulfilled usually defined by a maximum number of generations the first mewra step is completed and pareto optimal set of routes is available since the set may be numerous it is often recommended to facilitate the user with selecting the most suitable route out of the set this task is performed by the second mewra step in which a multicriteria ranking method sorts the set according to user s preferences towards the optimization criteria this way the first route in the pareto optimal set is the most suitable for the user 3 dynamic constraints in route planning related to ship motion in rough sea the most obvious constraints to be applied in the course of ship route optimization are related to the need for steering clear of land rocks shallow water and other navigational obstructions marked on sea charts moreover also some other restricted areas shall be avoided such as the areas temporarily closed for navigation all the mentioned no go zones are static in short term time independent and they can be relatively easily set up as constraints in the route optimization process however complying with all the static restrictions is yet insufficient in terms of ensuring safety of navigation since during the voyage numerous adverse phenomena are related to seaway conditions and relevant ship response keeping out of shallow waters is simply not enough the ship must control e g her rolling motions and avoid capsizing thus the second group of constraints requires radically different approach than the static no go zones since it ought to comprise quite complex behavior of ship when sailing in rough sea the sea keeping characteristics of the ship are strictly related to her stability nowadays regrettably there is a small connection between route planning being a part of the navigation process and ship stability on the basis of our research we postulate that the process of navigation should be more closely linked to stability of an operated vessel ship stability seems to be one of the key points allowing for further development of optimization in sea navigation numerous works undertaken in xviii century constituted the foundations of the scientific approach towards ship stability and the first stability measures were introduced like the metacentric height the motivation to the invention was as often a disaster of a ship on 9 november 1664 lune carrying huge number of passengers sank two miles to shore in fact the actual cause of her drowning was structural failure but the common perception was that it had been due to poor stability and open gun ports ferreiro 2004 that fostered the serious interest in ship stability especially the metacentric height in following years the righting arm curve was introduced also inspired by a catastrophe well known as monarch s and captain s case later the notion of dynamical stability was worked out as well although those theoretical achievements were not fully applied in sea practice and no stability standards were elaborated kobylinski and kastner 2003 ferreiro 2004 a significant breakthrough in the field of ship stability standardization brought jaakko rahola s dissertation from 1939 it became later the foundation of the intact stability code widely described in the literature womack 2002 kobylinski and kastner 2003 however the gz curve based criteria resolution a 167 es iv and the weather criterion resolution a 562 14 were consolidated into a consistent document called the code on intact stability for all types of ships covered by imo instruments is code numbered the resolution a 749 18 just in 1993 umeda 2008 one could expect the commonly accepted stability standards are effective solution for stability related accidents unfortunately the decades of experience revealed numerous incidents ranging from minor up to catastrophic many of them resulted from dynamic phenomena taking place in rough sea which are not covered by the contemporary stability standards backalov et al 2016 some unfavorable combinations of wave parameters and ship velocity vector may lead to dangerous situations even for vessels complying with the is code kobylinski 2014 the incident from 1998 when post panamax container vessel apl china experienced extreme rolling which caused massive cargo loss opened the discussion and lead to some scientific works on parametric rolling france et al 2003 further investigation based on computer modeling was carried out using nonlinear time domain programs developed by two independent institutions marin and saic both utilized programs predicted rolling between 30 and 40 for the vessel in the head seas encountered pérez rojas et al 2008 since that time the c11 class container vessel is probably the most thoroughly examined hull shape in the world and new researches are still published acanfora et al 2017a 2017b since the c11 hull is known as vulnerable to parametric rolling the next serious cargo damage experienced by the large container vessel svendborg maersk was also assigned to complex dynamic response the 347 m long fully cellular container vessel was bound for far east destination encountering quite heavy weather off the english channel she suddenly and without warning rolled to extreme angles and a large number of cargo containers fell overboard dmaib 2014 according to the further damage report the main reason of the incident was parametric rolling however aside from the instructive and valuable description of this case which can be read in the report there is one more element drawing readers attention i e the reference to the textbook used for training the navigators in denmark frey et al 2002 according to this book bridge officers ought to avoid wave encounter period close to the natural period of the ship roll and half of this period dmaib 2014 which is reasonable according to the present knowledge the problem is that navigators are instructed to obtain the natural period of roll by use of stop watch in calm seas at each departure which is usually unfeasible or alternatively on the basis of imo recommended simplified formula referred later in this paper as formula 1 although the actual natural period of roll may strongly differ from the calculated one when formula 1 is applied therefore the conditions allowing for building up an excessive roll motion due to parametric or synchronous rolling may be significantly different than expected by navigators nowadays wawrzynski and krata 2016a 2016b however the worldwide records evidence only limited number of unambiguous and a few suspected cases of the parametric rolling experienced by large container vessels these ships normally have a large flare in the bow region causing time dependent variations of stability characteristics when sailing in the wave length comparable to the length of the vessel the metacentric height directly depends on the second moment of inertia of the waterplane while the shape and area of the waterplane fluctuates periodically huss 2014 in such a case auto parametrically excited motion may be aroused especially during following seas or head seas courses france et al 2003 the need for coincidence of numerous circumstances explains relatively rare occurrence of parametric rolling the ship hull has to be formed with a large flared region the wave length has to be similar to ship s length the roll dumping coefficient needs to be relatively small being not able to dissipate the provided energy of excitation and the seas have to be following of head directed moreover rather large ships may suffer parametric rolling because this phenomenon is related to high seas typical for strong wind and in such conditions the wave length reaches hundreds meters and the ship length needs to be similar on the other hand the parametric roll can be a more severe phenomenon alas practically possible acanfora et al 2017b according to the literature and mariners experience it may lead to excessive accelerations and inertial loads on ship structure and cargo causing even the breaking of the design working load of a container lashing system acanfora et al 2017a thus despite of the apparently low frequency of the parametric roll this phenomenon is considered in our study in the form of imo circ 1228 based restrictions of the ship speed and course configuration the synchronous rolling of ships unlike the parametric rolling is a part of a routine experience of almost all mariners and all types of ships any ship is vulnerable to synchronous rolling in case of quite close tuning of the exciting period and the natural one so this phenomenon is rather common anyway synchronous rolling rarely causes substantial losses because usually it lasts too short thanks to actions of officers of the watch being aware of the hazard they repress development of the excessive motion just by mistuning usually by change of the ship heading causing a change of wave aspect and as a consequence the encounter frequency alters such operation is a routine on board response to the synchronous rolling however it is only feasible on the spot it would be safer and more efficient to predict in advance ship synchronous rolling and to plan a route in a way enabling complete avoidance of such situations thus application of the dynamic constraints leading to synchronous rolling exclusion may be found as a proactive safety oriented approach one of the significant response of the marine society to the observed shortages of the is code requirements was publishing in 1995 the imo guidance msc circ 707 then far developed and issued in 2007 as imo msc 1 circ 1228 this revised guidance to the master for avoiding dangerous situations in adverse weather and sea conditions is intended to give some help to ship masters when sailing in stormy conditions the relatively up to date publication in comparison to rahola s findings contains a set of remarks and advices regarding the avoidance of following dangerous dynamical phenomena at sea like surf riding and broaching to reduction of intact stability when riding a wave crest amidships synchronous rolling parametric roll motions imo 2007 especially the latter two elements described in imo circ 1228 related to the resonance gain of roll motion play important role in ship route planning issues about two decades ago at the same time when the msc circ 707 was worked out under the pressure of wide criticism of the contemporary stability standards the attempts were started to work out more rational stability criteria covering some typical dynamical phenomena inflicting hazards to ship sailing in rough sea the second generation ship stability criteria were then and still are assumed to be a reply to such demand facing demands for the is code revision the imo started discussion at the slf45 in 2002 since the united states reported that a post panamax containership complying with the is code suffered massive cargo damage due to parametric rolling in head waves the use of model experiments and numerical simulation was proposed to establish the performance based criteria umeda 2008 the second generation regulations are based on the following scenarios of intact stability failures 1 dead ship condition i e ship without forward speed exposed to action of waves and wind 2 pure loss of stability 3 parametric roll 4 surf riding and broaching to 5 excessive accelerations umeda 2008 2013 kobylinski 2014 the results provided by the second generation ship stability criteria are of binary nature likewise the first generation criteria the ship either passes the criteria or not without specifying the safety margin for various loading conditions moreover the discussed criteria can be used only at the design stage of a ship and they are not relevant to ship operation szozda 2014 apart from the roll resonance there is also another element having great impact on ship s stability namely excessive acceleration when a ship has disproportionate gm the natural period of roll becomes very small so that excessive acceleration occurs and may result in injury of crew or cargo damage umeda 2013 the working group recommended use of operational limitation from the level 2 criterion however the final proposal including the level 3 is still open umeda 2013 one of the available methods for increasing ship safety due to operational limitations is the use of numerical tools to simulate ship response in a wide range of conditions in such case the polar diagrams of maximum acceptable significant wave height versus the seaway period and wave direction for different speeds and load cases are prepared backalov et al 2016 the problem of excessive acceleration needs to be emphasized since the approach to ocean route planning presented in this paper deals with avoidance of such acceleration as well expected implementation of the second generation stability criteria shall notably improve the known shortages of the present standards in terms of relevant modeling of the dynamical phenomena the result of ship stability assessment provides supportive information to naval architect at the design stage nowadays one of the assumption formulated at the beginning of work under the second generation ship stability standards was that the design criteria should be supplemented with operational criteria umeda 2008 this postulate is not executed yet thus second generation ship stability criteria cannot be directly applied on board and utilized by the route planning and its optimization processes today actually the most reasonable approach towards coupling of ship stability performance and weather routing optimization seems to be meeting the intact stability code requirements which are obligatory and additionally applying the msc 1 circ 1228 recommendations non obligatory as a dynamic set of route planning optimization constraints the term dynamic constraints refers to constraints which vary in short time typically according to wind force and direction wave parameters ship speed and course there are numerous software tools designed to help navigators to calculate the restricted ship courses according to the revised guidance to the master for avoiding dangerous situations in adverse weather and sea conditions benedict et al 2014 ami seaware octopus onboard the authors of this paper have prepared their own implementation of msc 1 circ 1228 restricted courses which has been used in the previous work dealing with weather routing optimization krata and szlapczynska 2011 results of a sample calculation are shown in fig 2 where the potentially dangerous zones are depictured for a ship 113 m in length over all 106 m between perpendiculars and 18 9 m wide the actual draft of the vessel corresponding with the assumed in this paper sample loading conditions applied in route optimization algorithm equals 7 29 m the software generating the restricted zones according to msc 1 circ 1228 was run for two different metacentric heights equal gm 1 0 60 m and gm 2 0 98 m the value of gm 2 was created by increasing the gm 1 by 64 which reflects the equivalent metacentric height resulting from the actual shape of the ship gz curve rationale for this modification is provided in the next section of the paper and fig 3 and in krata and wawrzynski 2017b according to the guidance msc 1 circ 1228 there are some restricted zones which should be understood as the ship speed and course configuration not recommended due to actual possibility of dangerous dynamic phenomena occurrence one of the zones reflects surf riding and broaching risk another one successive high wave attack which is really not that common and the most important zone shows the resonance prospect it has to be emphasized that the resonance possibility is strictly related to the ship stability characteristics which may be clearly seen in fig 2 presenting the results obtained for the same ship with the same displacement but for two different values of the metacentric height since the calculation presented in fig 2 is relatively straightforward and the general algorithm does not cause noteworthy problems one may ask whether there is a scientific issue worth mentioning and studying to point out clearly the core matter of this research we need to mention about the resonance mode of ship rolling this may occur due to nonlinearity of ship response in resonance conditions i e when the encounter wave frequency is similar to first or eventually second harmonic frequency of natural roll motion of a ship landrini 2006 the prevention against synchronous rolling consists in avoiding such combinations of ship speed and course which result in the encounter wave period t e nearly equal to the natural rolling period of a ship τ t e τ in order to prevent parametric rolling the encounter period should be neither close to the natural rolling period of a ship nor one to half of this period t e τ t e 0 5 τ imo 2007 bearing in mind the crucial role played by ship s natural period of roll we shall consider the factors governing this period the simple method for calculation of the rolling period τ is given in the intact stability code and it is recommended for on board use in absence of sufficient information however the lack of reliable sufficient information is almost permanent the formula based on the initial metacentric height of a ship is imo 2008 1 τ 2 c b g m with the value of c coefficient c 0 373 0 023 b d 0 043 l 100 where c is the coefficient describing ships transverse gyration radius gm denotes the initial metacentric height b denotes ship s breadth and l denotes ship s length at waterline d is mean ship s draft actually the radius of gyration equals c b where c is the dimensionless coefficient to be multiplied by ship s breadth given in meters for a particular ship the only variable values in formula 1 are the metacentric height gm and the draft d the latter depends on her weight and hull s geometry so it is determined and constant for the particular loading condition the initial metacentric height is also determined by the distance between the vertical center of gravity and the initial metacentric point elevation if so the metacentric height also seems to be constant although the initial metacentric height is valid for small angles of ship heel while the potentially dangerous amplitudes of roll are far larger than the range of small angles of heel this is the reason why the natural period of roll of any ship depends in fact on her amplitude of roll and it is not steady as may be erroneously and hastily found wawrzynski and krata 2016a actually the natural period of roll may vary significantly depending on the amplitude of roll due to large range of variation of the equivalent metacentric height governing this period krata and wawrzynski 2017a thus a more reliable method for ship natural period of roll estimation should be applied in the msc 1 circ 1228 based algorithm for restricted courses calculation and subsequently in the weather routing optimization algorithm 4 reliable modeling of ship resonance mode of rolling the comprehensive study on ship natural period of roll estimation was carried out by wawrzynski and krata 2016b the approach is based on the nonlinear roll equation with special attention put on nonlinearity of gz curve generally the linear roll equation can model the synchronous rolling for small amplitudes it is widely assumed that the approximation for large angles is also quite fine which is true in case of some shapes of gz curve anyway the accuracy drops significantly for strongly nonlinear gz curves so in such cases the nonlinear righting moment utilized in the roll equation produces more precise results on large amplitude responses parametric roll being a much more complex phenomenon cannot be modeled by 1dof linear equation at all the assumption lying behind the elaborated method for predicting the natural period of ship s roll is to maintain the balance between accuracy and simplicity of the formula in the final onboard application the method is actually based on the differential equation of ship 1dof motion nonetheless its application in practice does not require solving such equation it is demonstrated in wawrzynski and krata 2016b that period of roll can be practically obtained according to the formula 2 τ ϕ a 2 c b g m e q ϕ a where the value of c coefficient remains the same as given in formula 1 and gm eq ϕ a denotes the equivalent value of the transverse metacentric height of the ship for a specified amplitude of roll ϕ a numerical simulations performed for numerous ships in different loading conditions have indicated the following two essential factors influencing variations of the rolling period 1 the area under gz curve from an angle of heel equal to zero up to the rolling amplitude 2 the average inclination of the tangent line to the gz curve from zero up to the rolling amplitude the proposed formula is based on both observed features and it is the following wawrzynski and krata 2016a 3 g m e q ϕ a 0 ϕ a g z ϕ d ϕ ϕ a 2 g z ϕ a 2 ϕ a where gz ϕ is the righting arm at the angle of heel equals ϕ and ϕ a is the actual amplitude of roll as it can be clearly seen the equivalent value of the metacentric height depends on the shape of the gz curve and on the amplitude of roll wawrzynski and krata 2016a thus for the sample loading condition of the previously considered general cargo vessel this equivalent metacentric height is calculated for a wide range of amplitudes of roll the ninth order polynomial power series with only odd powers is applied to accurately approximate the actual gz curve the result of computation carried out according to formula 3 and the corresponding gz curve are shown in fig 3 the sample gz curve of the considered vessel is rather typical thus the research results presented in the sixth section would show some more general trends nevertheless the equivalent metacentric height which is used in the course of the natural period of ship roll calculation varies significantly the extreme variation of gm eq reaches 64 of the initial value so it must affect the natural period of ship roll significantly formula 2 influence of the noticed progressive stiffening of considered ship gz curve on the restricted zones location is presented earlier in fig 2 the noteworthy variation of the equivalent metacentric height of the considered vessel causing even doubling of the initial gm value is something to think about seriously the question is whether such a result is rather accidental one or maybe it is typical for many different types of cargo ships to assess this crucial matter a series of calculations was carried out aiming at the typical loading conditions of numerous cargo vessels six different ships were taken into account to cover a variety of ship purpose their different particulars and loading condition from ballast up to fully loaded ones the main particulars of considered ships are given in table 1 table 1 refers to ships taken into account in the course of the proposed method validation the natural period of roll was calculated according to formulae 2 and 3 and then to compare the results with the use of roll equation four different loading conditions of each ship were considered to cover the realistic range of draft fourth and fifth columns of table 1 and typical initial metacentric heights for each ship type sixth and seventh columns of table 1 the range of obtained variation of the equivalent metacentric height is shown in last two columns of table 1 the given values reflect minimum and maximum variation of gm obtained throughout all considered cases for every ship so these values are not assigned to the minimum or maximum draft the conducted validation allows for further use of the proposed method for predicting the natural period of ship s roll since it was assessed as reliable comparing to the results of simulations based on roll equation with regard to nonlinearity of gz curve the method performs similarly or sometimes more accurately than the one proposed earlier in contento et al 1996 but is much more versatile in terms of the righting arm curve approximation it allows any approximating formula or even a set of discrete values of the gz which is appreciable a more sophisticated approach to gz can be found in bulian 2005 the analytical formula describing the righting arm with regard to wave profile is developed and applied in 1 5dof motion equation such an approach is more realistic however the method expressed by formulae 2 and 3 seems to be sufficient in the light of recent results of 6dof simulations performed with the use of laidyn software the predominant period of synchronous roll of the c11 container vessel obtained for jonswap wave spectrum fairly converged to the value predicted with the use of formulae 2 and 3 acanfora et al 2017b especially that work may be found as a justification of the proposed formulae application since the results obtained with the use of well benchmarked laidyn code were directly compared to the natural roll frequency calculated according to formulae 2 and 3 despite the 1dof model of rolling and the regular wave system behind these formulae they are effective also for irregular wave system which is more closely to the real one in rough sea conditions than regular one thus bearing in mind the simplified nature of the applied formulae 2 and 3 we find this method as capable to contribute the acceptable accuracy of the natural roll period prediction for the purpose of practical application of the revised guidance to the master in irregular sea conditions if so both synchronous rolling and parametric resonance are covered by the proposed approach as truthful as the applied guidance allows since the proposed method has been found as reliable the assessment of its significance is required in order to set down whether its application produces a noteworthy difference in gm values and as a consequence in locations of stability related dangerous zones krata and wawrzynski 2017a 2017b a wide range of possible amplitudes of roll was taken into account the performed series of calculations have shown that the equivalent value of the metacentric height varies significantly according to the amplitude of roll this is typical for all considered vessels however the variation of the gm eq value comparing to the initial gm ranges from 10 up to even 169 see results in table 1 with the mean value equal to 58 which is significant in terms of synchronous roll prediction the described method for reliable modeling of ship natural period of roll and as a consequence of the resonance roll prediction enables the application of trustworthy set of dynamic constraints to the route planning algorithm in the two following sections results of route optimization performed with the use of this method are presented preceded by the ship model description 5 modeling of ship speed and fuel consumption the ship considered in this study for optimization purposes is a representative of japanese built series of double decker general dry cargo vessels of rather small size the main parameters are length overall loa 113 m length between perpendiculars lbp 106 m breadth b 18 9 m extreme draft summer 8 54 m winter 8 36 m deadweight 9595 t gross tonnage 6030 net tonnage 3602 she is equipped with two deck cranes capable to heave up to 50 tons the ship propulsion utilizes a two stroke main engine supplying power to a single screw propeller declared fuel consumption is 15 0 tons a day at a contract speed 12 5 kn plus light fuel diesel consumption reaching 1 0 ton a day in port idle and 2 0 tons a day in port when working no diesel at sea is consumed with shaft generator working however such general data are insufficiently precise for the purpose of performed optimization reliable modeling of ship speed and fuel consumption in various weather conditions is essential regardless the adopted route finding method considering difficulties and potential sources of inadequacies of the theoretical models the fuel consumption and particular speed value in any weather and sea conditions are calculated with the use of a mathematical model based on numerous reports from the real operation of the model vessel such an empirical model dedicated to the particular ship class with co operation of the ship operators has been built in order to achieve this task a questionnaire has been prepared and distributed among chiefs and captains of the available ships of the considered class further processing of data related to speed and fuel consumption has been mainly based on the collected questionnaires there are two main sets of variables governing ship speed and fuel consumption namely meteo marine conditions and ship construction with special attention to energetic efficiency thus the questionnaires have asked about wind speed and direction predominant wave height and direction wave length ship displacement and trim ship speed through the water shaft revolutions shaft generator status fuel consumption the number of collected reports equals 244 and they are the basis for mathematical model of speed the performed analysis shows that the main factors influencing the ship speed are wind speed and relative direction and wave height these elements are introduced to the model and the coefficients are fitted to obtain the least square errors the resultant model of the ship speed is shown in fig 4 left plot based on the reported ship speed gathered in the questionnaires fig 4 right plot according to the collected reports the engine load is maintained at about 90 level to obtain typical cruise speed without excessive forcing of machinery the brake specific fuel consumption remains almost in the minimum plateau region which allows for economical navigation fig 5 the reported shaft revolutions are 170 rev min in almost all cases and rarely 169 rev min which is assumed as the same setting of the main engine heavy conditions due to severe stormy weather would certainly impose the engine load reduction however such situation is not modeled since one of the crucial aims of the proposed weather routing is to avoid the stormy weather at all so slow steaming is disregarded at the present stage of algorithm development the performed analysis of the reports has revealed that the fuel consumption at the economical setting of main engine corresponding to 170 rev min does not practically depend on the weather conditions therefore we set the steady fuel consumption per hour however the distance run on every ton of fuel obviously depends on ship speed and automatically on meteo marine conditions such model of fuel consumption would be invalid for heavy conditions but it does not affect the presented study since stormy weather is avoided according to the assumed constraints of the optimization algorithm 6 impact of gm eq variation on optimal ship routing to demonstrate possible application of the dynamical stability related constraints in weather routing and to verify how introducing the reliable predictions of synchronous rolling would affect ship performance a simulation environment has been built based on mewra weather routing tool szlapczynska 2015 a comparison between gm initial and gm eq has been made for two routing scenarios in north atlantic ocean waters both scenarios assume voyages with the same origin and destination points from bahamas to gibraltar but during different seasons the scenarios have been simulated by mewra tool utilizing weather predictions for north atlantic ocean downloaded from navsim ltd weather server table 2 presents the ship model parameters and table 3 the basic evolutionary parameters utilized by mewra in these scenarios the weather forecasts taken into account in the course of the optimization process include wind parameters speed and direction while wave conditions are interpolated based on these wind predictions facing some difficulties in wave field forecast availability for the sake of algorithm presentation we decided to approximate wave parameters on the basis of wind forecast the fully developed wave system is considered which is a simplification and the wave direction is assumed to be wind alike in case of wave forecast accessibility the algorithm automatically switches into the forecast utilization the following subsections present mewra optimization suite two experiments scenario 1 2 for comparison between gm initial and gm eq and scenarios data post processing with results discussion 6 1 multiobjective evolutionary weather routing algorithm mewra mewra is a heuristic optimization algorithm customized for weather routing purposes supporting multiple criteria and constraints it has been integrated with naviweather enc class software naviweather 2017 by navsim ltd for the purpose of this research mewra includes the following optimization criteria cost criterion to be minimized benefit criteria to be maximized 1 passage time of a route cost criterion 2 total fuel consumption for a route cost criterion 3 safety of passage associated with a route benefit criterion safety is modeled by a dimensionless index with value in 0 0 1 0 range where 0 0 depicts absolutely unsafe route and 1 0 ideally safe one the index is based on averaged fractional safety index values computed separately for each segment between control points of the route moreover mewra s optimization constraint set includes the following elements static constraints are time independent while dynamic ones are time dependent 1 landmass and shoal waters encountered en route static constraint 2 wind speed exceeding 55 kn encountered en route dynamic constraint 3 stability related regions violating msc 1 circ 1228 encountered en route dynamic constraint with sub regions of a surf riding or broaching to b successive high wave attack c roll resonance in terms of both synchronous and parametric rolling since the predictions of rolling described in section 4 have direct influence on resonance regions constraint 3c implementation of formula 3 has been applied to mewra s imo1228 constraint thus mewra is now able to check the constraint in gm initial constant value of the gm equal to the initial gm through the whole routing process or gm eq mode gm value changing for each route s control point depending of current wave conditions since the gm eq based approach requires the estimation of expected amplitude of the ship roll the 1dof roll equation is adopted wawrzynski and krata 2016a 4 ϕ 2 μ ϕ g r x 2 g z ϕ ξ w c o s ω e t where μ is the damping coefficient g is the gravity acceleration r x is the gyration radius of a ship and added masses e g dragged water which is assumed to be constant for the sake of simplicity and calculated according to the imo recommended simplified formula 1 gz is the righting arm ξ w means the exciting moment coefficient and ω e denotes the frequency of the exciting moment due to waves the integration of equation 4 is performed with the use of runge kutta method initially prepared in matlab and then transferred to the main optimization algorithm the wave system applied in this study is regular so the solution of the roll equation is deterministic for every encounter wave characteristic the 1dof formula 4 is not capable to cover such complex modes of motion like parametric resonance surf riding broaching etc however it is not intended to be capable in this research the only expected functionality of this equation is to facilitate estimation of the amplitude of roll to utilize it in formula 3 enabling the equivalent metacentric height computation then the gm eq is further processed in the course of the route optimization as the key element of the dynamic constraints set 6 2 scenario 1 caribbean bahamas to europe gibraltar departure 27 09 2013 03 00 gmt the weather forecast for the first day of voyage was favorable fig 6 the downwind sailing with moderate wind speed let expect economical fuel consumption at a good speed however the following and quartering seas could potentially expose the ship to hazardous dynamic phenomena which needs to be assessed in the course of optimization process such conditions persisted till october the first when the wind direction gradually turned clockwise and the wind speed significantly dropped at the end of the voyage the beam relative wind direction was prevailing the potential synchronous rolling has to be assessed in mewra environment working in either gm inital or gm eq mode switched in the configuration pareto optimal routes have been sought for route bahamas gibraltar departure date 27th sept 2013 03 00 gmt figs 7 and 8 present pareto optimal sets obtained for gm inital and gm eq respectively best routes separately for each mode in figs 9 and 10 respectively have been selected by mewra out of the pareto sets based on the following criteria weights passage time 0 5 fuel consumption 0 2 safety of passage 0 3 a comparison of best routes parameters obtained for the scenario in gm initial and gm eq modes is presented in table 4 the results presented in table 4 reveal that the resulting best routes in gm initial and gm eq differ in their basic parameters time fuel and safety but only very slightly differences around 0 1 location of control points for both the best routes is also quite similar figs 9 and 10 as it is depicted by the number of pareto optimal routes the gm eq mode is in this case more restrictive which is also confirmed by the increasing number of route exclusions due to resonance eliminating the routes due to violation of imo1228 constraint as it may be noted the total number of imo1228 exclusions may be significantly greater than the total number of routes here 5000 this is due to the fact that a single route may be imo 1228 excluded as unfeasible for the imo 1228 constraint multiple times before it gets fixed made feasible when comparing mewra results obtained for gm initial and gm eq modes one should not focus on analysis of global route parameters such as passage time or fuel consumption but rather on verifying if applying gm eq so varying gm value during voyage depending of the weather conditions has impact on feasibility of the route defined by location in space and time of route s control points when compared with gm initial a constant gm value for the whole voyage one can easily imagine that a route either pareto optimal or not found in the gm initial mode could not be assumed feasible thus safe if a more reliable rolling prediction would be applied as in gm eq mode in order to perform such analysis a series of mewra route data for the same scenario and weather data is required this kind of result comparison for scenario 1 will be presented later in section 5 3 6 3 scenario 2 caribbean bahamas to europe gibraltar departure 25 02 2017 03 00 gmt according to the weather forecast the wind direction was generally adverse fig 11 although the great circle voyage requiring proceeding northward could allow the ship for wind and seas remaining closer to beam direction however from march the fourth till the sixth the deep low built up in the north atlantic with counter clockwise air mass circulation generated noteworthy wave field which could cause heavy rolling of the ship from march the seventh the wind speed dropped at the end of the voyage the ship could expect moderate to low wind speed and corresponding seas coming from port side beam in mewra environment working again in either gm inital or gm eq mode switched in the configuration pareto optimal routes have been sought for the same as in scenario 1 route bahamas gibraltar but different departure date now 25th feb 2017 03 00 gmt figs 12 and 13 present pareto optimal sets obtained in scenario 2 for gm inital and gm eq respectively best routes separately for each mode in figs 14 and 15 respectively have been selected by mewra out of the pareto sets based on the same weight configuration as in scenario 1 a comparison of best routes parameters obtained for the scenario in gm initial and gm eq modes is presented in table 5 as presented in table 5 the resulting best routes in gm initial and gm eq still differ in their basic parameters time fuel and safety and geographical locations figs 14 and 15 only in a subtle way as it is depicted by the number of pareto optimal routes and number of route exclusions due to resonance the gm initial mode is in this case more restrictive as presented in scenario 1 the total number of imo1228 exclusions may be significantly greater than the total number of routes here 5000 again as in scenario 1 a systematic series of tests is required to compare feasibility of the routes found in both modes the next section addresses this issue also for data from the scenario 2 6 4 data post processing and results discussion the main reason for data post processing was to perform a series of tests for routes either pareto optimal or not generated by mewra in order to compare their performance in terms of their feasibility for both modes gm initial and gm eq and both scenarios presented in the two previous sub sections thus for scenario 1 and 2 the mewra s logfiles has been parsed and all the ship routes created through the evolution have been post processed two scenarios and separate route sets for gm initial and gm eq mode for one mode 2 scenarios 50 generations 100 routes in generation 10 000 routes which gives 20 000 as total number of processed routes for both gm initial and gm eq modes for each route it has been noted whether it was originally feasible that is if all the assumed optimization constraints have been met for the route the original feasibility has been stated for given weather data predictions either sept 2013 or feb 2017 and given gm initial gm eq mode thus in post processing each route has been once more uploaded to mewra and verified two times to check if is feasible using gm initial and gm eq modes weather data predictions appropriate to given scenario have been used the idea is to compare if the original feasibility of each route equals to the post processed feasibility in all cases when the same gm initial gm eq mode has been utilized for the original and post processed feasibility the results have been equal in 100 of cases which confirms correctness of the approach table 6 presents the results obtained for mixed gm initial gm eq modes utilized in comparison of the original and post processed routes feasibility inequalities in feasibility for both scenarios have been presented in detail in table 7 introduction of the gm eq mode resulted in different feasibility assessment for some routes in the set in all the cases however percentage of the routes with different original and post processed feasibility table 6 vary from over 10 down to 0 7 as revealed by table 7 there is also no explicit pattern for gm initial to gm eq transition in some cases scenario 1 2 in gm eq gm initial the gm eq is stricter and does not allow for routes feasible in gm initial while in cases of scenario 1 2 in gm initial gm eq it is less restrictive than gm initial the number of routes varying upon the applied version of the metacentric height e g gm initial or gm eq is not massive according to the obtained results tables 6 and 7 this creates the question if the application of the proposed dynamic constraints based on the equivalent metacentric height is justified there are additional calculations needed in the tested approach and moreover the estimation of the amplitude of roll is required to address this problem we need to consider the characteristics of the gm variation which is earlier shown in fig 3 both the initial and the equivalent metacentric heights are almost equal for the small amplitudes of roll therefore the routes planned in the conditions exciting only gentle rolling are nearly the same the better the weather the smaller differences between routes can be noticed regardless the version of the metacentric height taken into account in the course of route optimization however for larger amplitudes of roll the value of the equivalent metacentric height significantly differs comparing to the initial one thus the cases with quite heavy weather reveal the variety of optimization results which is presented in tables 6 and 7 although it needs to be emphasized that the wind speed and the sea state are not the only variables influencing these differences in resultant routes the wave aspect the angle of wave attack plays a vital role as well since the synchronous roll or the parametric roll of the ship may occur in case of well tuning of the wave encounter frequency and the natural frequency of roll anyway without the wind and sea being strong enough the dangerous rolling cannot develop in the light of such explanation we state that the application of the dynamic constraints based on the equivalent metacentric height of the ship is justified despite the number of routes affected by the substitution of the gm initial by the gm eq these cases are crucial for safety of navigation since they reflect the heavier rolling of the ship and the largest risk for cargo damage or maybe even the ship capsizing potentially incorrect restrictions which could be taken into account due to the invalid application of the initial metacentric height for large amplitudes of roll instead of gmeq producing correct resonance prediction can mislead the crew exposing the ship to excessive motion and undue accelerations 7 summary and conclusions in ship weather routing the optimization goal is usually defined as finding a compromise between voyage economic costs and safety and security of the ship crew passengers and cargo ship stability issues including modeling of the rolling motion are obviously of significant importance when safety measures are evaluated this paper presents how application of the reliable modeling of ship synchronous rolling conditions influences when applied the weather routing process the equivalent metacentric height gm eq is utilized in the optimal route finding process and evaluated in comparison to the initial metacentric height gm initial in the routing process a dynamic optimization constraint checking routes compliance with msc 1 circ 1228 utilizes either gm eq or gm initial for further synchronous rolling predictions application of the gm initial approach for calculating the ship s natural period of roll may lead to dangerous situations of experiencing unexpected large amplitudes of roll due to synchronous or parametric rolling in case of prompt and effective action of an officer on watch this may at least force the ship to change its course which is economically inefficient such situation is especially likely to occur to ships with strongly nonlinear characteristics of gz curve i e in the range of possible rolling amplitudes quite common when the maximum of the gz curve is located at the relatively small angles of heel for instance about 30 generally two potential scenarios are possible when initial gm is used 1 the calculated natural period of roll diverges from the actual one erroneously leading the ship to avoid configurations of speed and course within a safe range which needlessly strains the operator s budget 2 and vice versa the ship falsely avoids configurations of speed and course within a safe range exposing herself to real danger due to the unexpected tuning of actual natural period of roll with the encountered period of wave the new method based on gm eq unlike the gm initial one enables credible foreseeing of the real value of the period of roll which allows for safe and economically efficient navigation as depicted by the research results the newly proposed approach utilizing varying value of gm eq instead of a constant value of gm initial to multi objective weather routing brings about significant changes to the resulting pareto optimal set of routes factor of the changes depends of the weather conditions especially wave height and direction however it is concluded that in some cases even more than 10 of considered routes may be differently evaluated by the multi objective optimization algorithm due to gm initial to gm eq exchange alone thus it is justified and recommended to promote further research on this very promising approach to develop in the future ship routing software aiming at more precise and reliable route recommendations acknowledgements a part of this research has been supported by navsim

23629,a model is developed to investigate the dynamic behavior of a deepwater drilling platform riser system under emergency evacuation conditions in the model the riser in the ocean environment is modeled as a beam with coupled transverse and axial motions and its upper and lower ends are respectively connected to the platform and to the lower marine riser package with hard joints the fluid forces and the added mass and drag forces are modeled using a semi empirical morison equation so the equations of the model are nonlinear coupled and multibody the model is discretized in a finite element approach and solved using newmark s method its validity is verified using ansys using the model the influences of platform motion riser suspension length ocean load and platform evacuation speed on the dynamic behavior of the riser are determined and the results can provide theoretical support for the design and practical operation of hard suspension pipe strings keywords deepwater riser hard suspension emergency evacuation dynamic behavior nomenclature e is young s modulus a 0 is the cross sectional area i 0 is the area moment of inertia of the cross section around the neutral axis ρ is the material density c a is the added mass coefficient c d is the drag coefficient for an oscillating cylinder in still water ρ f is the density of the surrounding fluid a f is the cross section of the displaced volume v o is the volume of the deformed riser m l m r p is the mass of lower marine risers package ω is the angular frequency of the system u boat t is the heave displacement of the drilling platform 1 introduction in offshore oil development it is very important to have an appropriate and rapid evacuation strategy to avoid damage in the event of a typhoon in order to reduce the operation risks and the recovery time the riser usually disconnects from the wellhead and suspends from the drilling platform to be evacuated as shown in fig 1 in the disconnected condition the lower end of riser can be regarded as a free boundary for the rigid suspension mode shown in fig 2 the expansion joins of the riser are folded with the riser suspending from the diverter shell the tensioner no longer bears the weight of the riser therefore the rotation constraints of the pipe and the platform must be considered in emergency evacuation operations with the rigid suspension mode the top of the riser system is rigidly connected with the drilling platform or drilling ship trough a tensioner or a universal joint thus the motion of the drilling platform is transmitted directly to the riser system and thereby produces vibrations in extreme sea conditions these vibrations may cause the riser system to collide with the moon pool or to shear off as a result of loss of strength or buckling failure in addition since the lower marine risers package lmrp is connected to lower bottom of the suspension system in emergency condition the maximum dynamic top tension of the riser system is likely to exceed the design limit load of the lifting device leading to the falling accident of the riser system therefore the operation of the rigid suspension riser must comply with the basic design criteria such as those presented in table 1 early conventional riser designs were usually based on static analyses however with offshore operations taking place in ever increasing water depths and with the consequent increase in riser length the influence of dynamic factors on the riser has become more and more obvious wang 2014 the long and thin pipe strings are more prone to suffer from serious dynamic response problems under the action of waves and currents qi 2015 previous experimental and theoretical investigations chang et al 2009 zhou and liu 2016 liu et al 2013 mao et al 2016a 2016b gong et al 2014 gong and xu 2016 have shown that the dynamic response of the riser is affected by a number of factors including the top tension the mud density in the pipe the top and bottom rotational stiffnesses the offset of the drilling ship the presence of auxiliary pipelines and waves and current flows among many others a few studies morooka et al 2006 abdel raheem 2016 chatjigeorgiou and mavrakos 2010 elsayed et al 2016 wang et al 2014 reyes et al 2016 on the dynamics behavior of slender ocean pipes have been reported the nonlinear dynamic modeling method presented in these studies provided a meaningful reference for the evacuation dynamic analysis of deep water risers in spite of these the study on the hanging evacuation dynamic behavior of the ocean riser is still very limited sparks et al 1982 investigated the longitudinal resonant behavior of deepwater risers under disconnection condition a study by brekke et al 2004 found that heaving motion of the drilling platform will cause damage to the riser system induced by dynamic compression and excessive stress at the top and eventually increase the risk of collision between the riser system and the fairing or moon pool steddum 2003 analyzed the axial and lateral dynamic responses of a riser with additional mass and axial damping and proposed an improved design for connection and suspension components of the riser system an experimental study and a numerical simulation of a three dimensional suspension riser model were carried out by itoh et al 2006 ambrose et al 2001 examined the stress and load performances of soft and hard suspension riser systems under different environmental conditions and found that compared with the soft suspension mode a riser system with hard suspension is more sensitive to sea conditions and to the dry wet weight ratio the longitudinal vibrational response of a rigid suspension riser was analyzed by zhang and gao 2010 they found that the natural frequency and dynamic load of the riser changed with its weight to suppress the generation of resonances between the riser and ocean waves it is necessary to reduce the dynamic load dai and gao 2009 carried out a finite element analysis of a rigid suspension riser system and calculated the strength of the system under three different current conditions also using a finite element method wu et al 2014 investigated the dynamic behavior of a rigid suspension riser system under evacuation conditions taking account of the effects of platform motion waves and currents none of the above studies considered coupling between the longitudinal and transverse vibrations of the riser a flexible segment model and a rigid finite element method were respectively proposed by xu and wang 2012 and adamiec wójcik et al 2015 to analyze the dynamic behavior of risers coupled longitudinal and lateral vibrations of a simply supported beam were analyzed by xing and liang 2015 and hu and yang 2010 and coupled longitudinal and lateral vibrations of the tension leg of an offshore platform by han and benaroya 2000 their results show that the effects of coupling become more obvious with increasing slenderness ratio the ratio of the length to the cross sectional radius compared with a general beam or a tension leg a hard suspension pipe string has a greater slenderness ratio and its load environment is also more complex therefore the purpose of this paper is to establish a coupled dynamic model of a hard suspension riser on this basis the influences of platform motion evacuation speed ocean load and suspension length on the dynamic behavior of the riser are studied 2 nonlinear dynamics model 2 1 basic assumptions and mechanical model according to the characteristics of the deepwater hard suspension riser system the following assumptions are made in order to derive the dynamic governing equations of the system wang 2014 1 in the mechanical analysis of the riser it is assumed that the material is homogeneous and isotropic and that the elasticity remains linear during movement and deformation 2 since the translational and rotational velocities of the mud in the riser are very low the reaction force inertial force and centrifugal force of the mud are ignored 3 the influence of the joints on the bending rigidity of the riser is neglected 4 the effect of structural damping on the model of the riser is neglected 5 as the slenderness ratio is relatively large the riser is simplified as a flexible rod in the mechanical analysis 6 the directions of ocean currents and the deformation of the riser are assumed to lie in the same plane 7 the top of the riser and the platform are each rigidly fixed in the longitudinal and transverse directions while they are linked to each other by an elastic rotary connection as shown in fig 2 the relationship between the angular displacement θ and the bending moment m at the upper end of the riser is as follows 1 m k θ where k is the rotational stiffness of the elastic constraint at the upper end of the riser 8 the lower end of the riser is rigidly connected with the blowout preventer in each degree of freedom based on the above assumptions a mechanical model is established as shown in fig 2 2 2 coordinate displacement and strain assuming linear behavior the transverse and longitudinal motions are decoupled and can be described by the following simple linear partial differential equations xing and liang 2015 2a for londitudinal motion e a 0 2 u x t x 2 ρ a 0 2 u x t t 2 2b for transverse motion e i 0 4 υ

labeled by their location in the undeformed configuration x the reference and current configurations of the midplane are shown in fig 3 the dashed line is the reference configuration and the solid line is the current configuration according to kirchhoff s hypothesis we can write the displacements as 3 u 1 x y t u x t y υ x x t u 2 x t υ x t u 3 x t 0 where u and υ are the deflections of the midplane in the x and y directions respectively and y is the transverse distance from the midplane to the point of interest on the cross section in the reference frame assuming a symmetrical cross section u is also the average deflection of the beam element let us suppose that the deformation of the riser is a small strain with moderate rotation and use the assumed displacement field given in

dynamic analysis code based on the above model was written in fortran the validity of the model and the code were tested by analyzing the longitudinal transverse dynamic response of a hard suspension riser system fig 4 the basic parameters of the calculation model are shown in table 2 in the calculation the riser string was discretized uniformly by 50 longitudinal transverse coupling elements a uniform ocean flow with speed 1 2 m s was simulated and the heave and horizontal movement were considered fig 5 shows a comparison of the dynamic responses of the longitudinal and transverse waves based on the results obtained in this paper and a nonlinear transient response analysis using ansys the observation point is located at the lmrp fig 5 a shows that the lateral vertical coupling effect has a significant influences on the displacement of transverse vibration with the frequency of lateral vertical coupling vibration being larger whereas fig 5 b the coupling effect of lateral vertical coupling vibration is relatively small the amplitude and frequency of the longitudinal displacement from the two methods are consistent this shows that the model and the calculation code are valid which lays the foundation for analysis of the nonlinear longitudinal transverse coupling characteristics of a rigid suspension riser under emergency evacuation conditions 4 dynamic characteristic analysis 4 1 model parameter the dynamic response characteristics of a pipe string in a deepwater well in the south china sea are analyzed the design construction and ocean environmental parameters are shown in tables 3 and 4 in the analysis the suspension riser string is discretized uniformly by 50 longitudinal transverse coupling elements the directions of the ocean fluid flow and the platform evacuation are taken to lie along the positive direction of the y axis 4 2 modal analysis from the submatrix of the stiffness matrix of the nonlinear system k 2 k 3 and k 4 it can be seen that the stiffness matrix is time variant for a arbitrarily small time quantum the frequencies and modes are assumed not to change with time and their calculation equations are given as follow 16 k t φ ω 2 m φ eq 16 shows that the frequencies and modes in the nonlinear system in this paper are time variant using eq 16 the first six order frequencies and modes of the deepwater hard suspension riser shown in section 4 1 have been calculated and respectively shown in figs 6 and 7 fig 6 shows that the frequency of transverse vibration varies greatly with time and increases with the increase of order at the initial stage of the vibration the frequency of each order rises sharply then changes up and down at a certain value the main reason is that at the beginning of the evacuation the tension as well as the stiffness of the riser increases sharply due to the riser s flexes later the riser vibrates in a certain bending shape and the axial force and stiffness changes periodically a comparison between the coupling and uncoupling static frequency is also carried out in fig 6 which shows that frequencies taking into account the longitudinal transverse coupling are much larger than those that do not consider coupling ratio in fig 7 represents that the ratio of the displacement of each mass points at different times it is found in fig 7 that the first order vibration mode of the suspension system changes most the displacement of the lower end of the system is large under the vibration of each order in some vibration modes such as the third the fourth and the sixth order large vibration amplitude may occur along the whole length direction 4 3 effect of flow velocity the main parameters for the analysis of the influence of shear flow are shown in table 4 for suspension evacuation conditions the longitudinal transverse coupling dynamic response of the riser is analyzed considering the effects of ocean flow with return periods of 5 10 25 and 50 years fig 8 shows that the influence of ocean flow velocity on the longitudinal vibration of the bottom point of the pipe string is not significant in contrast to its clear influence on the transverse vibration the greater the ocean flow velocity the smaller is the transverse displacement of the bottom point fig 9 shows that with increasing ocean current velocity the maximum dynamic tension force the compressive force and the bending moment in the pipe string all decrease the main reason for this behavior is that in the present analysis the evacuation direction of the platform is taken as the direction of ocean fluid flow when the ocean current velocity is relatively low as it gradually increases the relative displacement between the pipe string and the ocean current is reduced and the flow resistance of the pipe string decreases therefore the transverse vibrational displacement and the internal force on the pipe string decrease accordingly 4 4 effect of evacuation speed fig 10 a shows that there is no obvious effect of platform evacuation velocity on the longitudinal vibrational frequency of the lowest end point with increasing evacuation speed the amplitude of longitudinal vibration increases slightly and the equilibrium position moves up fig 10 b shows that the higher the evacuation speed the greater is the transverse displacement of the lowest point when the evacuation speed is low the motion of the pipe string is controlled mainly by the ocean current so the displacement of the lower end point is positive when the evacuation speed is high the motion of the pipe string is controlled mainly by the evacuation speed so the displacement of the bottom point is negative fig 11 a shows that with increasing evacuation speed the tension in the upper part of the pipe string decreases while the tension near the bottom point first decreases and then increases fig 11 b and c shows that the maximum dynamic compressive force and dynamic bending moment of the pipe string gradually increase with increasing evacuation velocity the main reason for this is that the ocean current velocity decreases gradually with water depth therefore with increasing evacuation speed the relative velocity between the upper part of the pipe and the ocean current gradually decreases so the tension in the pipe string is reduced and the string becomes more prone to compression and bending 4 5 effect of platform motion the influence of platform motion on the dynamic behavior of the pipe string is investigated in this section fig 12 a shows that the longitudinal vibrational frequency of the lowest end of the pipe string is controlled by the frequency of longitudinal motion of the platform fig 12 b shows that the frequency of the heaving motion of the platform affects the transient process of transverse vibration but has no obvious effect on the steady state process fig 13 shows that with increasing frequency of heaving motion the maximum dynamic tension decreases while the maximum dynamic compressive force and the bending moment both increase the maximum dynamic tension occurs at the top of the pipe string while the maximum dynamic compressive force occurs in the upper and middle parts of the string the dynamic bending moment distribution in the pipe string is relatively uniform 4 6 effect of suspension length in this section the influence of the suspension length on the dynamic internal forces on the pipe string is investigated fig 14 a shows that in the steady state process it is the heaving motion of the platform rather than the suspension length that is the main factor controlling the frequency and amplitude of the longitudinal vibrations of the pipe string fig 14 b shows that the suspension length has a significant influence on the transverse vibration of the pipe string fig 15 a shows that the dynamic tension in the pipe string decreases with decreasing tube length fig 15 b shows that the dynamic compressive force first decreases and then increases with decreasing tube length fig 15 c shows that the maximum dynamic moment occurs in the upper part of the column while the dynamic bending moment decreases and then increases with decreasing suspension length taking these results together when the suspension length is in the range of 1100 1300 m the internal force in the pipe string can be controlled at a reasonable level 5 discussion and conclusion 1 a nonlinear longitudinal transverse dynamic coupling model has been developed for analyzing the dynamic behavior of a deepwater riser under a hard suspension mode the model can calculate the dynamic displacements axial internal force and moment responses of the suspension riser under emergency conditions such as typhoons thereby providing a theoretical basis for guiding operations in these conditions 2 the combined effects of longitudinal transverse coupling platform motion ocean flow velocity suspension length and evacuation speed have been taken into account in the construction of the model comparison between the results of the model calculations and results from ansys shows that the computational accuracy of the model can satisfy practical engineering requirements 3 some interesting phenomena have been found through analysis of the dynamic behavior of a riser in the south china sea under emergency conditions the longitudinal vibration of the pipe string is controlled mainly by the platform motion with other factors having no significant effects transverse vibration in contrast is influenced by various factors the maximum dynamic axial force decreases with increasing water depth and the maximum dynamic moment becomes more uniform to keep the internal force in the pipe string below its maximum acceptable value the evacuation velocity and suspension length must be controlled within certain ranges acknowledgment this work has been supported in part by open fund oge201701 01 of key laboratory of oil gas equipment ministry of education southwest

23629,a model is developed to investigate the dynamic behavior of a deepwater drilling platform riser system under emergency evacuation conditions in the model the riser in the ocean environment is modeled as a beam with coupled transverse and axial motions and its upper and lower ends are respectively connected to the platform and to the lower marine riser package with hard joints the fluid forces and the added mass and drag forces are modeled using a semi empirical morison equation so the equations of the model are nonlinear coupled and multibody the model is discretized in a finite element approach and solved using newmark s method its validity is verified using ansys using the model the influences of platform motion riser suspension length ocean load and platform evacuation speed on the dynamic behavior of the riser are determined and the results can provide theoretical support for the design and practical operation of hard suspension pipe strings keywords deepwater

of the drilling platform 1 introduction in offshore oil development it is very important to have an appropriate and rapid evacuation strategy to avoid damage in the event of a typhoon in order to reduce the operation risks and the recovery time the riser usually disconnects from the wellhead and suspends from the drilling platform to be evacuated as shown in fig 1 in the disconnected condition the lower end of riser can be regarded as a free boundary for the rigid suspension mode shown in fig 2 the expansion joins of the riser are folded with the riser suspending from the diverter shell the tensioner no longer bears the weight of the riser therefore the rotation constraints of the pipe and the platform must be considered in emergency evacuation operations with the rigid suspension mode the top of the riser system is rigidly connected with the drilling platform or drilling ship trough a tensioner or a universal joint thus the motion of the drilling platform is transmitted directly to the riser system and thereby produces vibrations in extreme sea conditions these vibrations may cause the riser system to collide with the moon pool or to shear off as a result of loss of strength or buckling failure in addition since the lower marine risers package lmrp is connected to lower bottom of the suspension system in emergency condition the maximum dynamic top tension of the riser system is likely to exceed the design limit load of the lifting device leading to the falling accident of the riser system therefore the operation of the rigid suspension riser must comply with the basic design criteria such as those presented in table 1 early conventional riser designs were usually based on static analyses however with offshore operations taking place in ever increasing water depths and with the consequent increase in riser length the influence of dynamic factors on the riser has become more and more obvious wang 2014 the long and thin pipe strings are more prone to suffer from serious dynamic response problems under the action of waves and currents qi 2015 previous experimental and theoretical investigations chang et al 2009 zhou and liu 2016 liu et al 2013 mao et al 2016a 2016b gong et al 2014 gong and xu 2016 have shown that the dynamic response of the riser is affected by a number of factors including the top tension the mud density in the pipe the top and bottom rotational stiffnesses the offset of the drilling ship the presence of auxiliary pipelines and waves and current flows among many others a few studies morooka et al 2006 abdel raheem 2016 chatjigeorgiou and mavrakos 2010 elsayed et al 2016 wang et al 2014 reyes et al 2016 on the dynamics behavior of slender ocean pipes have been reported the nonlinear dynamic modeling method presented in these studies provided a meaningful reference for the evacuation dynamic analysis of deep water risers in spite of these the study on the hanging evacuation dynamic behavior of the ocean riser is still very limited sparks et al 1982 investigated the longitudinal resonant behavior of deepwater risers under disconnection condition a study by brekke et al 2004 found that heaving motion of the drilling platform will cause damage to the riser system induced by dynamic compression and excessive stress at the top and eventually increase the risk of collision between the riser system and the fairing or moon pool steddum 2003 analyzed the axial and lateral dynamic responses of a riser with additional mass and axial damping and proposed an improved design for connection and suspension components of the riser system an experimental study and a numerical simulation of a three dimensional suspension riser model were carried out by itoh et al 2006 ambrose et al 2001 examined the stress and load performances of soft and hard suspension riser systems under different environmental conditions and found that compared with the soft suspension mode a riser system with hard suspension is more sensitive to sea conditions and to the dry wet weight ratio the longitudinal vibrational response of a rigid suspension riser was analyzed by zhang and gao 2010 they found that the natural frequency and dynamic load of the riser changed with its weight to suppress the generation of resonances between the riser and ocean waves it is necessary to reduce the dynamic load dai and gao 2009 carried out a finite element analysis of a rigid suspension riser system and calculated the strength of the system under three different current conditions also using a finite element method wu et al 2014 investigated the dynamic behavior of a rigid suspension riser system under evacuation conditions taking account of the effects of platform motion waves and currents none of the above studies considered coupling between the longitudinal and transverse vibrations of the riser a flexible segment model and a rigid finite element method were respectively proposed by xu and wang 2012 and adamiec wójcik et al 2015 to analyze the dynamic behavior of risers coupled longitudinal and lateral vibrations of a simply supported beam were analyzed by xing and liang 2015 and hu and yang 2010 and coupled longitudinal and lateral vibrations of the tension leg of an offshore platform by han and benaroya 2000 their results show that the effects of coupling become more obvious with increasing slenderness ratio the ratio of the length to the cross sectional radius compared with a general beam or a tension leg a hard suspension pipe string has a greater slenderness ratio and its load environment is also more complex therefore the purpose of this paper is to establish a coupled dynamic model of a hard suspension riser on this basis the influences of platform motion evacuation speed ocean load and suspension length on the dynamic behavior of the riser are studied 2 nonlinear dynamics model 2 1 basic assumptions and mechanical model according to the characteristics of the deepwater hard suspension riser system the following assumptions are made in order to derive the dynamic governing equations of the system wang 2014 1 in the mechanical analysis of the riser it is assumed that the material is homogeneous and isotropic and that the elasticity remains linear during movement and deformation 2 since the translational and rotational velocities of the mud in the riser are very low the reaction force inertial force and centrifugal force of the mud are ignored 3 the influence of the joints on the bending rigidity of the riser is neglected 4 the effect of structural damping on the model of the riser is neglected 5 as the slenderness ratio is relatively large the riser is simplified as a flexible rod in the mechanical analysis 6 the directions of ocean currents and the deformation of the riser are assumed to lie in the same plane 7 the top of the riser and the platform are each rigidly fixed in the longitudinal and transverse directions while they are linked to each other by an elastic rotary connection as shown in fig 2 the relationship between the angular displacement θ and the bending moment m at the upper end of the riser is as follows 1 m k θ where k is the rotational stiffness of the elastic constraint at the upper end of the riser 8 the lower end of the riser is rigidly connected with the blowout preventer in each degree of freedom based on the above assumptions a mechanical model is established as shown in fig 2 2 2 coordinate displacement and strain assuming linear behavior the transverse and longitudinal motions are decoupled and can be described by the following simple linear partial differential equations xing and liang 2015 2a for londitudinal motion e a 0 2 u x t x 2 ρ a 0 2 u x t t 2 2b for transverse motion e i 0 4 υ

labeled by their location in the undeformed configuration x the reference and current configurations of the midplane are shown in fig 3 the dashed line is the reference configuration and the solid line is the current configuration according to kirchhoff s hypothesis we can write the displacements as 3 u 1 x y t u x t y υ x x t u 2 x t υ x t u 3 x t 0 where u and υ are the deflections of the midplane in the x and y directions respectively and y is the transverse distance from the midplane to the point of interest on the cross section in the reference frame assuming a symmetrical cross section u is also the average deflection of the beam element let us suppose that the deformation of the riser is a small strain with moderate rotation and use the assumed displacement field given in equation 3 the green s strain can then be written as 4 ε x x u x y 2 υ x 2 1 2 υ x 2 ε y y ε x y ε x z ε y z ε z z 0 2 3 control equation and boundary conditions via hamilton s principle hamilton s

based on the results obtained in this paper and a nonlinear transient response analysis using ansys the observation point is located at the lmrp fig 5 a shows that the lateral vertical coupling effect has a significant influences on the displacement of transverse vibration with the frequency of lateral vertical coupling vibration being larger whereas fig 5 b the coupling effect of lateral vertical coupling vibration is relatively small the amplitude and frequency of the longitudinal displacement from the two methods are consistent this shows that the model and the calculation code are valid

ocean flow velocity the smaller is the transverse displacement of the bottom point fig 9 shows that with increasing ocean current velocity the maximum dynamic tension force the compressive force and the bending moment in the pipe string all decrease the main reason for this behavior is that in the present analysis the evacuation direction of the platform is taken as the direction of ocean fluid flow when the ocean current velocity is relatively low as it gradually increases the relative displacement between the pipe string and the ocean current is reduced and the flow resistance of the pipe

are odd functions of y the second and fifth terms disappear because of the symmetry of the cross section and y 2 becomes the area moment of inertia i o about the neutral axis the remaining terms are
