14200,treatment and the recovery of textile wastewater are important due to their high volume and toxicity although several studies have been conducted on the use of membrane bioreactors mbr for textile wastewater treatment they have mainly focused on synthetic wastewater or aerobic mbrs however anaerobic mbr anmbr offers potential advantages of high color removal with lower energy consumption in this context this study aims at investigating the performance of anmbr for the treatment of real textile wastewater in addition to treatability studies the membrane foulants were investigated in detail which may be used in the design and operation of real scale plants the permeate cod and color concentrations were decreased down to 70 mg l and 150 pt co respectively in the gpc analysis pollutants with molecular weights greater than 15 kda detected in the supernatant were removed by the dynamic cake layer developed on the membrane and only low molecular weight organics appeared in the permeate anmbr was operated successfully at a flux of 4 1 0 7 lmh with a cleaning cycle of once a week the impact of physical and chemical cleaning of the fouled membrane on the tmp elevation rate was also evaluated to determine the cleaning efficiency keywords anaerobic membrane bioreactor fouling characterization membrane fouling real textile wastewater water reuse 1 introduction wastewaters generated in textile industries have a complex and highly variable composition 1 characterized by high dye content salts suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand 2 in addition to dyes surfactants inhibitory compounds and chlorinated compounds aox textile effluents also contain several auxiliary chemicals 3 therefore textile wastewaters have serious environmental impacts e g aesthetic degradation and carcinogenic properties 4 the treatment of textile industry effluents especially color removal is a challenge due to difficult biodegradation of toxic pollutants hence several physical chemical and biological processes are applied to meet the discharge standards due to environmentally friendly nature and low cost biological treatment processes are generally preferred 5 6 under anaerobic conditions color removal may be more efficient compared to aerobic processes due to easy cleavage of azo dyes to aromatic amines via azo reductase activity 7 membrane bioreactors mbrs can be considered as the combination of membrane separation and conventional biological treatment in the past two decades the number of studies on mbrs has significantly increased all over the world to provide better effluent qualities to meet strict discharge standards and increasing demand for wastewater reuse it was reported in our previous studies that anaerobic mbr anmbr can be used to treat synthetic textile effluents 2 7 8 generally synthetic wastewater containing single textile dyestuff have been used in biodegradability studies in the literature 9 however textile effluents contain not only textile dyes but also several auxiliary chemicals and inhibitory compounds to the best of authors knowledge there are several studies involving anmbr 2 7 8 10 conducted with synthetic textile wastewater but there is still need for comprehensive studies on real textile effluent treatment the main drawback of the mbr process is fouling membrane fouling generally occurs as a result of primary fouling mechanisms including adhesion deposition mechanism 11 13 and filtration resistance caused by chemical potential mechanism 14 16 therefore this study aims at evaluating lab scale anmbr for the treatment of real textile effluents additionally a special emphasis has been given to the filtration performance and foulant characterization which may help to better understand the fouling phenomena in anmbrs 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactors and start up the lab scale anmbr was made of plexiglass having total and working volumes of 4 8 l dimensions of 8 15 40 cm and 3 5 l respectively fig 1 level sensors ph and oxidation reduction potential orp probes feeding sampling and permeate ports were located on the removable cover an online system was used to record the filtration pressure ph and orp flat sheet microfiltration membranes polyethersulfone with 0 45 μm nominal pore sizes were adapted into two modules with a total active area of 0 01 m2 for each module anaerobic atmosphere was recirculated at a velocity of 1 m3 m2 membrane area h to alleviate the excess accumulation of cake layer 7 by physically scouring the cake layer formed on the membrane intermittent filtration cycle 5 min suction followed by 1 min relaxation was applied to relax the cake layer on the membrane surface which helps to scour the cake an anaerobic digester sludge obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant located in istanbul was used as inoculum throughout the operation the flux was kept relatively constant at 4 1 0 7 l m2 h lmh and the hydraulic retention time hrt was kept at around 2 days 1 9 0 4 days in the anmbr sludge was only drawn from the reactor for analysis therefore sludge retention time srt was accepted as infinite 2 2 textile wastewater characteristics the tested wastewater was obtained from a wastewater treatment plant that receives 50 000 m3 day flow of textile effluents from a special industrial district zone containing a number of textile industries the treatment plant includes coarse and fine screens followed by aerated grit chambers equalization basins and a 5 stage bardenpho process the wastewater used in lab scale anmbr studies was withdrawn from the equalization basin wastewater characteristics are presented in table 1 the wastewater studied was characterized by its high color cod sulfate and chloride concentrations the total and soluble cod concentrations were 1000 110 mg l and 573 74 mg l respectively the wastewater was supplemented with glucose and soluble cod concentration was increased to 936 82 mg l between days 121 and 128 in order to determine the impact of increased soluble and readily biodegradable cod concentration on the removal performance although the average color concentration in the influent of wastewater treatment plant was around 1000 pt co the color concentration in the sampled wastewater during the study period averaged 511 146 pt co color was also measured as spectral absorption coefficient sac considering absorbance values at three different wavelengths of 436 nm 525 nm and 620 nm 17 sac values of the wastewater sampled during the study period averaged 15 6 3 3 11 0 2 9 and 8 6 2 0 1 m respectively the high variation of the textile wastewater characteristics is one of the main difficulties both in the design and operation of wastewater treatment plants additionally textile wastewater is generally characterized by high conductivity levels up to 9 ms cm high conductivity may effect treatment performance and increase the membrane fouling due to sludge deflocculation 2 during the study period conductivity averaged 5 ms cm the lab scale reactor was fed with real textile wastewater after its ph was adjusted to between 7 and 7 5 with sulfuric acid during the treatment studies wastewater was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c to avoid any degradation the feed flow to the mbr was controlled using level sensors 2 3 membrane cleaning the anmbr was operated at a constant flow and the filtrate was drawn by a vacuum pump trans membrane pressure tmp change was constantly monitored and instantly recorded by the computerized system membrane cleaning was applied when the tmp reached to 500 600 mbar all the ex situ cleanings were chemical except days 121 and 125 when physical cleaning was applied for comparison a two stage cleaning was performed in the first stage the membrane was physically cleaned with a sponge under tap water in the second stage physically cleaned membrane was soaked into naocl 500 mg l or 1 000 mg l and acidic solution in which ph was adjusted to 2 0 with h2so4 for 1 h respectively 8 four different membrane cleaning strategies were applied in lab scale operation table 2 to compare the tmp elevation rates 2 4 membrane fouling characterization in order to characterize the membrane foulants gel permeation chromatographic gpc analyses of organic matters attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir analyses of the permeate and gel cake layer developed on the membrane surface were carried out the detailed information for the analyses can be obtained from yurtsever et al 2 7 2 5 determination of fouling rate and resistances recorded tmp data was used to calculate the membrane fouling rate different cleaning strategies applied were compared based on the membrane fouling rate which was calculated according to eq 1 1 r f t m p m t m p 0 δ t where rf is fouling rate mbar min tmpm and tmp0 are maximum and minimum trans membrane pressures mbar in a 5 min operation cycle i e tmpm and tmp0 were obtained just before the end of permeation cycle and right after the start of new permeation cycle in respective order δt is filtration time min of fouling cycle following equation was used to calculate membrane filtration resistance 18 2 r t m p μ j where j is the flux as m3 m2 s tmp is the trans membrane pressure as pa μ is the permeate viscosity as pa s and r is the membrane filtration resistance as 1 m the filtration resistance in series model was used to calculate the total filtration resistance 19 intrinsic membrane resistances reversible and irreversible membrane resistances were calculated as described by yurtsever et al 2 2 6 analytical methods color as pt co cod alkalinity ss and vss were measured according to standard methods 20 color was also measured as sac at three different wavelengths of 436 525 and 620 nm as 1 m according to brik et al 21 samples obtained from influent effluent and mixed liquor of the mbrs were first filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate syringe filters before color and cod analyses ph was directly measured with a ph meter hanna instruments hi 2211 the centrifuged through centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min and then filtered through 0 45 μm samples obtained from mixed liquor and permeate were used for smp measurements as carbohydrate and protein according to dubois 22 and bradford 23 methods respectively the total smp concentrations were also expressed as total cod assuming stoichiometric conversion factors for typical protein c16h24o5n4 and carbohydrate c6h10o5 to cod as 1 5 and 1 2 respectively 24 extracellular polymeric substances eps were extracted from mixed liquor according to heat extraction procedure given in yurtsever et al 8 and measured as carbohydrate and protein 3 results and discussions 3 1 performance of anmbr the supernatant and permeate cod concentrations are presented in fig 2 after around 20 days of acclimation period permeate cod between days 21 and 120 averaged 153 59 mg l after supplementation of glucose between days 121 and 128 the permeate cod averaged 219 81 mg l hence supplementation of glucose to increase the soluble cod concentration to around 1000 mg l increased the permeate cod concentration slightly considering soluble and total feed cod concentrations the cod removal efficiencies throughout the study averaged 72 12 and 82 8 respectively due to a technical problem experienced between days 67 and 85 permeate cod concentration increased to around 300 mg l after solving the technical problem permeate cod decreased back to around 150 mg l throughout the bioreactor operation hrt and srt were kept at 2 0 h and infinite respectively in our previous study 2 cod removal efficiencies over 90 were obtained in anmbr treating glucose supplemented 1000 mg cod l synthetic textile wastewater at varying nacl concentration in the present study lower cod removal efficiencies were obtained which should be due to the use of real textile wastewater having a more complex structure and additionally containing non biodegradable organic compounds significantly higher cod concentrations in the supernatant in the bioreactor compared to the permeate were observed for all the measurements supernatant cod concentrations were measured between days 90 and 128 as illustrated in fig 2 during this period the permeate and supernatant cod averaged 178 53 mg l and 310 46 mg l respectively hence around 43 of cod removal was achieved during the filtration this shows that a part of cod was removed by the microorganisms in the cake layer developed on the membrane during the filtration which was supported by previous studies 2 7 25 kapdan and alparslan 9 reported maximum cod removal of 75 at 2 day hrt for real textile wastewater treatment in an anaerobic bioreactor which is close to the findings of the present work similarly şen and demirer 26 obtained approximately 80 cod removal at the organic loading rate of 1 kg cod m3 in an anaerobic fluidized bed bioreactor treating real textile wastewater in another study amaral et al 27 reported 34 43 cod removal in an uasb reactor receiving real textile wastewater they emphasized that high concentrations of sodium chloride present in the textile effluent may have adversely affected the cod removal performance although in the present study the chloride concentration and conductivity of the wastewater were also high table 1 relatively higher cod removal performance was achieved this should be due to the use of membrane bioreactor which may have some advantages over other bioreactor configurations i e keeping high molecular weight compounds and particular organic matter in the bioreactor due to cake layer developed on the membrane and membrane itself 2 which will also be discussed later the cod removal performance observed in the present study is generally lower compared to aerobic mbrs as expected generally over 90 cod removal efficiencies for aerobic mbrs were reported in the literature 28 however anmbr requires lower energy produces less sludge and gives better performance for color removal compared to its aerobic counterparts 8 the feed and permeate fig 2 color concentrations averaged 511 146 pt co and 221 39 pt co respectively throughout the study average and maximum color removal as pt co was 53 14 and 77 respectively between days 121 and 128 increasing soluble cod concentration to around 1000 mg l by glucose supplementation did not improve the color removal performance as the permeate color during this period averaged 235 14 pt co hence readily biodegradable cod did not limit the color removal performance and the remaining permeate color may be considered as non biodegradable color the turkish water pollution control regulation sets the color limit for discharging textile wastewater as 280 pt co for grab samples all the color measurements of the permeate were below the discharge limits in the bioreactor color concentration was quite high compared to permeate fig 2 which should be due to the removal of color by the cake layer developed on the membrane similar to cod as discussed before the supernatant color concentration as pt co was measured after day 67 in this period supernatant and permeate color concentrations averaged 488 79 pt co and 239 22 pt co respectively hence around 51 color removal was achieved during the filtration the removal performance of cod by cake filtration was 43 which is significantly lower compared to color removal it seems that the cake layer on the membrane was composed of highly active microorganisms and contributed to the performance obtained in the bioreactor color concentrations were also measured as sac at three different wavelengths in the feed and permeate fig 3 the feed sac values at 436 nm 525 nm and 620 nm averaged 15 6 3 3 11 0 2 9 and 8 6 2 0 1 m respectively the permeate values were 8 1 1 6 4 9 1 2 4 0 1 1 1 m in respective order the color removal performance for all three wavelengths averaged 51 3 5 the maximum color removal performance for three different wavelengths were between 74 and 77 hence similar results with pt co measurements were observed firmino et al 29 used an anaerobic bioreactor uasb to treat real textile wastewater and achieved color removal efficiency between 45 57 similarly şen and demirer 26 operated an anaerobic reactor fbr and found 59 color removal at a hrt of 24 h in real textile wastewater treatment in a sequential anaerobic aerobic systems tomei et al 30 obtained a 65 color removal efficiency in the anaerobic bioreactor and emphasized that aerobic bioreactor used after the anaerobic one had a decolorization efficiency of 30 34 the color removal performance in our study was similar to the previous studies although cod in the influent was relatively low which should be due to retention of all the biomass in the bioreactor and the cake layer developed on the membrane surface polishing the permeate significantly which are the important advantages offered by anmbr in the study the influent and effluent phs were generally between 7 0 and 7 5 data not shown sufficient alkalinity was present in the real wastewater and the influent and effluent alkalinities averaged 538 128 mg l and 648 138 mg l caco3 respectively data not shown orp values during the steady operation was around 430 mv however when the bioreactor cover was opened for membrane cleaning or during technical problems orp values increased due to exposure of bioreactor content to air throughout the operation orp values averaged 403 63 mv data not shown 3 1 1 variations of smp and eps smp and eps are complex organic compounds that are released during bacterial metabolism many researchers reported that smp and eps have significant effects on membrane biofouling 31 the total smp concentrations in the supernatant and permeate of the anmbr were presented in table 3 the total smp concentration in the supernatant averaged 49 19 mg cod l which decreased to 22 7 mg cod l in the permeate corresponding to around 54 smp rejection by the cake layer deposited on the membrane the rejection performance for the color and cod were 51 and 43 respectively hence smp rejection performance was much higher compared to cod and similar to color although cake filtration increases the permeate quality deposition of the rejected foulants on the membrane increases the membrane fouling in our previous study 8 in the anmbr fed with synthetic wastewater around 3 3 of the cod was converted to smp whereas in the present study this value was about 5 0 which may be due to use of real wastewater in the present study similarly aquino and stuckey 24 reported that the presence of toxic compounds increases the smp generation in anaerobic chemostats fed on glucose in their study chloroform addition increased the smp generation smp so from 2 to 8 in another study it was emphasized that this value may increase depending on the presence of toxic substances and operating conditions such as srt 32 considering the use of real wastewater and infinite srt in the present study the observed smp concentration is in good agreement with the literature in the supernatant and permeate protein content of total smp on cod basis averaged 21 6 and 25 8 respectively eps concentration did not change significantly throughout the study and averaged 27 6 8 mg g mlvss eps concentration depends on the wastewater characteristics and reactor operational conditions 33 moreau et al 34 noted that the eps concentration may fluctuate between 100 200 mg g mlvss in the treatment of high strength wastewater but in full scale activated sludge systems it may range between 10 and 30 mg g mlvss gao et al 35 reported eps concentration of 28 mg g mlss at temperature of 37 c in an anmbr also in our previous studies 2 7 eps concentrations in the anmbr averaged 32 8 mg g mlvss and 37 10 mg g mlvss respectively hence the observed eps concentrations are in line with the literature findings 3 2 membrane filtration performance the flux hrt and tmp values are shown in fig 4 the average flux was selected as 4 1 0 7 lmh considering the results of our previous study 2 depending on the wastewater characteristics and the membrane configurations the applicable flux in anmbrs shows great variation especially for the industrial wastewaters 36 in a study the impact of powdered activated carbon pac addition on the performance of anmbr treating textile effluent was investigated 37 they reported that pac addition significantly increased the applicable flux in an anmbr in the absence of pac higher head loss and reduction in permeate flow was observed when flux was equal or higher than 3 6 lmh 37 which is quite close to the average flux 4 1 lmh in the present study after 6 days from the start of operation the tmp exceed the threshold level of 700 mbar and the first chemical cleaning was applied after chemical cleaning while the tmp only increased to 50 mbar at the end of 2 weeks it increased to 600 mbar in the next 2 days average membrane fouling regime was once a week and the fouled membranes were regularly cleaned chemically with 500 mg l naocl table 2 period 1 2 increasing the naocl concentration from 500 mg l to 1000 mg l in the second period did not change the membrane fouling rate on day 78 membranes were changed with the new ones and naocl concentration in the cleaning solution was kept at 1000 mg l which resulted in more effective foulant removal this decreased the membrane fouling intervals and chemical cleaning was applied once in 9 10 days this should be due to accumulation of irrecoverable foulants on the membrane due to long operation period and the use of low concentration of naocl during the cleaning operations table 2 period 1 in our previous anmbr study conducted with synthetic wastewater it was sufficient to use 300 mg l naocl for membrane cleaning purposes 8 however in the present study the use of real wastewater required cleaning with higher naocl concentrations due to more severe fouling therefore the characteristics of the wastewater have significant influence on the membrane fouling which may in turn impact the chemical cleaning frequency and the chemical type and or dosage the real wastewater used in this study caused more serious pore blocking due to complex nature higher potential of inorganic scaling on the membrane and the presence of colloidal organics regular maintenance cleaning e g once or twice a week is required in full scale plants also to avoid the accumulation of irrecoverable foulants on the membrane 38 in the last stage of operation the membranes were only physically cleaned occasionally under tap water i e between 122 and 128 days and no chemical cleaning was applied consequently as discussed later the fouling rate increased sharply and the membranes were fouled within 4 days after first cleaning and within 2 days in the subsequent cycles the reason for the fouling in a shorter time after the second physical cleaning may be due to inefficient removal of foulant from membrane surface and the accumulation of irreversible and irrecoverable foulants on the membrane table 4 3 3 fouling rates and filtration resistances the fouling rate between each cleaning periods were calculated considering the tmp elevation fig 4 the fouling rates at different operational durations are given in table 4 in the first 45 day period of the study chemical cleaning was carried out with 500 mg l naocl solution in this stage the average fouling rate was obtained as 0 063 0 007 mbar min after that the naocl concentration was increased to 1 000 mg l in the following periods the fouling rate stayed high till the 78th day when fouled membranes were replaced with new membranes after installing virgin membranes the fouling rate decreased significantly to 0 035 mbar min on day 94 and averaged 0 043 0 008 mbar min during the remaining period this decrease in the membrane fouling rate caused a significant increase in the required frequency of membrane cleaning from once in 7 days to 10 days after day 121 when only physical cleaning was applied table 2 period 4 fouling rate increased to 0 087 mbar min during the operation of anmbr gas recirculation and the intermediate filtration were applied to remove the cake layer accumulated on the membrane surface the fouling that can be removed by physical scouring and intermittent filtration is defined as reversible fouling which was calculated considering the rate of tmp elevations during the 5 min filtration cycles the calculated reversible fouling rate did not show significant variation until day 121 and averaged 7 0 0 5 mbar min after day 121 only ex situ physical cleaning was applied and no chemical cleaning was used to remove the fouling the reversible fouling rate increased to 9 15 2 47 mbar min this should be due to only partial removal of foulants i e irreversible fouling could not be removed as a result local flux was much higher compared to those observed when chemical cleanings were applied hence fouling occurred in a short period of time the resistances of fouled chemically cleaned and new membranes were also determined in order to calculate irreversible fouling rirv which can be removed by chemical cleaning and irrecoverable fouling rirc i e type of fouling that cannot be removed even by chemical cleaning table 5 although the resistances in the first and second operational periods at which different concentrations of naocl were used for membrane cleaning table 2 were similar the resistance of chemically cleaned membrane in the second stage was relatively lower which should be due to use of higher naocl concentration during the membrane cleaning in the third period of the study both fouled membrane and chemically cleaned membrane resistances were lower compared to the first and second periods which should be due to use of new membrane in the third stage of the operation 3 4 characterization of membrane foulants 3 4 1 molecular weight distribution of soluble organics the gpc analyses were conducted on the supernatant permeate and cake layer samples as illustrated in fig 5 the first gpc measurements from supernatant and permeate were conducted on day 55 although the same peaks were observed in both supernatant and permeate samples the height of the peak that appeared at 16 15th min corresponding to the high molecular weight organic 15 kda was much higher in the supernatant sample this peak almost disappeared in the permeate sample and was probably retained by the membrane or cake layer during filtration similar results have been reported in other studies 39 40 additionally the peak that appeared at 17 8th min slightly decreased in the permeate sample in the gpc measurements three high signal peaks were observed at approximately 16th 17 8th and 18 9th min corresponding to molecular weights 15 kda 2 5 kda and 0 4 kda respectively in our previous study conducted with synthetic wastewater molecules with similar weights were encountered in gpc measurements and similarly an organic molecule that appeared at 16th min was retained by the cake layer 7 the molecular weight distribution of soluble organics in the cake layers of anmbr operated was also illustrated in fig 5 both quite high and low molecular weight compounds were detected with low signal in the cake layer sample but the peak heights belonging to high molecular weight compounds were quite low the peak was observed at 11th min corresponding to the very high molecular weights of around 1000 kda this peak shows that molecules with high molecular weight compounds formed in the reactor were rejected by the membrane or cake layer in the study of okamura et al 41 quite high molecular weight organics corresponding to the around 103 105 kda were observed in the gpc measurements of the gel layer samples taken from the membrane surface they reported that this could be polysaccharide also these soluble high molecular weight organic compounds may originate from high molecular weight smp and eps cell debris 7 although the rejection of high molecular weight organic compounds originating from smp and eps improves the removal efficiency the accumulation of these compounds on the membrane surface leads to membrane fouling as reported in many studies 31 the peak corresponding to 15 kda appeared at 16 15th min was detected in the supernatant and cake layer but not in permeate hence organic molecules with 15 kda molecular weight were retained by cake layer hence although microfiltration membranes were used it behaved as ultrafiltration thanks to the development of cake layer or dynamic membrane on the membrane surface molecular weight compounds as low as 0 6 kda and 0 4 kda were detected in the cake layer which may be due to conversion of high molecular compounds to lower ones by the microbial community in the cake layer 3 4 2 ft ir analyses ft ir analyses were carried out on the two samples obtained from the cake layer on days 94 and 111 fig 6 although similar peaks were detected the peak heights observed on day 111 were higher the peaks at 3280 1 cm may be due to oh stretching indicating the presence of hydroxyl functional group 42 two sharp peaks detected at 2923 1 cm and 2854 1 cm especially on day 111 were due to aliphatic methylene bands originating from aliphatic ch stretches 42 43 ft ir analyses illustrated presence of both carbohydrate and protein like compounds in the cake layer which should be mainly due to smp and eps 4 conclusions in the study a real textile industry wastewater was fed to a lab scale anmbr and its treatment and filtration performances were investigated cod and color concentrations were decreased to around 160 mg l and 221 pt co respectively anmbr was successfully operated at 4 1 0 7 lmh with weekly maintenance cleaning increasing the naocl concentration in the chemical cleaning resulted in better cleaning efficiency and removal of pore blocking foulants gpc analysis illustrated that the cake layer developed on the membrane retained high molecular organic compounds in the supernatant and polished the permeate the results illustrated that anmbr may be used for the treatment of textile industry effluents due to relatively higher cod and color removal efficiencies achieved although sustainable flux around 4 lmh was relatively lower compared to aerobic counterparts 10 20 lmh declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement tthis study was funded by the scientific and technological research council of

studies was withdrawn from the equalization basin wastewater characteristics are presented in table 1 the wastewater studied was characterized by its high color cod sulfate and chloride concentrations the total and soluble cod concentrations were 1000 110 mg l and 573 74 mg l respectively the wastewater was supplemented with glucose and soluble cod concentration was increased to 936 82 mg l between days 121 and 128 in order to determine the impact of increased soluble and readily biodegradable cod concentration on the removal performance although the average color concentration in the influent

fouling characterization in order to characterize the membrane foulants gel permeation chromatographic gpc analyses of organic matters attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir analyses of the permeate and gel cake layer developed on the membrane surface were carried out the detailed information for the analyses can be obtained from yurtsever et al 2 7 2 5 determination of fouling rate and resistances recorded tmp data was used to calculate the membrane fouling rate different cleaning strategies applied were compared based on the membrane fouling rate which was calculated according to eq 1 1 r f t m p m t m p 0 δ t where rf is fouling rate mbar min tmpm and tmp0 are maximum and minimum trans membrane pressures mbar in a 5 min operation cycle i e tmpm and tmp0 were obtained just before the end of permeation cycle and right after the start of new permeation cycle in respective order δt is filtration time min of fouling cycle following equation was used to calculate membrane filtration resistance 18 2 r t m p μ j where j is the flux as m3 m2 s tmp is the trans membrane pressure as pa μ is the permeate viscosity as pa s and r is the membrane filtration resistance as 1 m the filtration resistance in series model was used to calculate the total filtration resistance 19 intrinsic membrane resistances reversible and irreversible membrane resistances were calculated as described by yurtsever et al 2 2 6 analytical methods color as pt co cod alkalinity ss and vss were measured according to standard methods 20 color was also measured as sac at three different wavelengths of 436 525 and 620 nm as 1 m according to brik et al 21 samples obtained from influent effluent and mixed liquor of the mbrs were first filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate syringe filters before color and cod analyses ph was directly measured with a ph meter hanna instruments hi 2211 the centrifuged through centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min and then filtered through 0 45 μm samples obtained from mixed liquor and permeate were used for smp measurements as carbohydrate and protein according to dubois 22 and bradford 23 methods respectively the total smp concentrations were also expressed as total cod assuming stoichiometric conversion factors for typical protein c16h24o5n4 and carbohydrate c6h10o5 to cod as 1 5 and 1 2 respectively 24 extracellular polymeric substances eps were extracted from mixed liquor according to heat extraction procedure given in yurtsever et al 8 and measured as carbohydrate and protein 3 results and discussions 3 1 performance of anmbr the supernatant and permeate cod concentrations are presented in fig 2 after around 20 days of acclimation period permeate cod between days 21 and 120 averaged 153 59 mg l after supplementation of glucose between days 121 and 128 the permeate cod averaged 219 81 mg l hence supplementation of glucose to increase the soluble cod concentration to around 1000 mg l increased the permeate cod concentration slightly considering soluble and total feed cod concentrations the cod removal efficiencies throughout the study averaged 72 12 and 82 8 respectively due to a technical problem experienced between days 67 and 85 permeate cod concentration increased to around 300 mg l after solving the technical problem permeate cod decreased back to around 150 mg l throughout the bioreactor operation hrt and srt were kept at 2 0 h and infinite respectively in our previous study 2 cod removal efficiencies over 90 were obtained in anmbr treating glucose supplemented 1000 mg cod l synthetic textile wastewater at varying nacl concentration in the present study lower cod removal efficiencies were obtained which should be due to the use of real textile wastewater having a more complex structure and additionally containing non biodegradable organic compounds significantly higher cod concentrations in the supernatant in the bioreactor compared to the permeate were observed for all the measurements supernatant cod concentrations were measured between days 90 and 128 as illustrated in fig 2 during this period the permeate and supernatant cod averaged 178 53 mg l and 310 46 mg l respectively hence around 43 of cod removal was achieved during the filtration this shows that a part of cod was removed by the microorganisms in the cake layer developed on the membrane during the filtration which was supported by previous studies 2 7 25 kapdan and alparslan 9 reported maximum cod removal of 75 at 2 day hrt for real textile wastewater treatment in an anaerobic bioreactor which is close to the findings of the present work similarly şen and demirer 26 obtained approximately 80 cod removal at the organic loading rate of 1 kg cod m3 in an anaerobic fluidized bed bioreactor treating real textile wastewater in another study amaral et al 27 reported 34 43 cod removal in an uasb reactor receiving real textile wastewater they emphasized that high concentrations of sodium chloride present in the textile effluent may have adversely affected the cod removal performance although in the present study the chloride concentration and conductivity of the wastewater were also high table 1 relatively higher cod removal performance was achieved this should be due to the use of membrane bioreactor which may have some advantages over other bioreactor configurations i e keeping high molecular weight compounds and particular organic matter in the bioreactor due to cake layer developed on the membrane and membrane itself 2 which will also be discussed later the cod removal performance observed in the present study is generally lower compared to aerobic mbrs as expected generally over 90 cod removal efficiencies for aerobic mbrs were reported in the literature 28 however anmbr requires lower energy produces less sludge and gives better performance for color removal compared to its aerobic counterparts 8 the feed and permeate fig 2 color concentrations averaged 511 146 pt co and 221 39 pt co respectively throughout the study average and maximum color removal as pt co was 53 14 and 77 respectively between days 121 and 128 increasing soluble cod concentration to around 1000 mg l by glucose supplementation did not improve the color removal performance as the permeate color during this period averaged 235 14 pt co hence readily biodegradable cod did not limit the color removal performance and the remaining permeate color may be considered as non biodegradable color the turkish water pollution control regulation sets the color limit for discharging textile wastewater as 280 pt co for grab samples all the color measurements of the permeate were below the discharge limits in the bioreactor color concentration was quite high compared to permeate fig 2 which should be due to the removal of color by the cake layer developed on the membrane similar to cod as discussed before the supernatant color concentration as pt co was measured after day 67 in this period supernatant and permeate color concentrations averaged 488 79 pt co and 239 22 pt co respectively hence around 51 color removal was achieved during the filtration the removal performance of cod by cake filtration was 43 which is significantly lower compared to color removal it seems that the cake layer on the membrane was composed of highly active microorganisms and contributed to the performance obtained in the bioreactor color concentrations were also measured as sac at three different wavelengths in the feed and permeate fig 3 the feed sac values at 436 nm 525 nm and 620 nm averaged 15 6 3 3 11 0 2 9 and 8 6 2 0 1 m respectively the permeate values were 8 1 1 6 4 9 1 2 4 0 1 1 1 m in respective order the color removal performance for all three wavelengths averaged 51 3 5 the maximum color removal performance for three different wavelengths were between 74 and 77 hence similar results with pt co measurements were observed firmino et al 29 used an anaerobic bioreactor uasb to treat real textile wastewater and achieved color removal efficiency between 45 57 similarly şen and demirer 26 operated an anaerobic reactor fbr and found 59 color removal at a hrt of 24 h in real textile wastewater treatment in a sequential anaerobic aerobic systems tomei et al 30 obtained a 65 color removal efficiency in the anaerobic bioreactor and emphasized that aerobic bioreactor used after the anaerobic one had a decolorization efficiency of 30 34 the color removal performance in our study was similar to the previous studies although cod in the influent was relatively low which should be due to retention of all the biomass in the bioreactor and the cake layer developed on the membrane surface polishing the permeate significantly which are the important advantages offered by anmbr in the study the influent and effluent phs were generally between 7 0 and 7 5 data not shown sufficient alkalinity was present in the real wastewater and the influent and effluent alkalinities averaged 538 128 mg l and 648 138 mg l caco3 respectively data not shown orp values during the steady operation was around 430 mv however when the bioreactor cover was opened for membrane cleaning or during technical problems orp values increased due to exposure of bioreactor content to air throughout the operation orp values averaged 403 63 mv data not shown 3 1 1 variations of smp and eps smp and eps are complex organic compounds that are released during bacterial metabolism many researchers reported that smp and eps have significant effects on membrane biofouling 31 the total smp concentrations in the supernatant and permeate of the anmbr were presented in table 3 the total smp concentration in the supernatant averaged 49 19 mg cod l which decreased to 22 7 mg cod l in the permeate corresponding to around 54 smp rejection by the cake layer deposited on the membrane the rejection performance for the color and cod were 51 and 43 respectively hence smp rejection performance was much higher compared to cod and similar to color although cake filtration increases the permeate quality deposition of the rejected foulants on the membrane increases the membrane fouling in our previous study 8 in the anmbr fed with synthetic wastewater around 3 3 of the cod was converted to smp whereas in the present study this value was about 5 0 which may be due to use of real wastewater in the present study similarly aquino and stuckey 24 reported that the presence of toxic compounds increases the smp generation in anaerobic chemostats fed on glucose in their study chloroform addition increased the smp generation smp so from 2 to 8 in another study it was emphasized that this value may increase depending on the presence of toxic substances and operating conditions such as srt 32 considering the use of real wastewater and infinite srt in the present study the observed smp concentration is in good agreement with the literature in the supernatant and permeate protein content of total smp on cod basis averaged 21 6 and 25 8 respectively eps concentration did not change significantly throughout the study and averaged 27 6 8 mg g mlvss eps concentration depends on the wastewater characteristics and reactor operational conditions 33 moreau et al 34 noted that the eps concentration may fluctuate between 100 200 mg g mlvss in the treatment of high strength wastewater but in full scale activated sludge systems it may range between 10 and 30 mg g mlvss gao et al 35 reported eps concentration of 28 mg g mlss at temperature of 37 c in an anmbr also in our previous studies 2 7 eps concentrations in the anmbr averaged 32 8 mg g mlvss and 37 10 mg g mlvss respectively hence the observed eps concentrations are in line with the literature findings 3 2 membrane filtration performance the flux hrt and tmp values are shown in fig 4 the average flux was selected as 4 1 0 7 lmh considering the results of our previous study 2 depending on the wastewater characteristics and the membrane configurations the applicable flux in anmbrs shows great variation especially for the industrial wastewaters 36 in a study the impact of powdered activated carbon pac addition on the performance of anmbr treating textile effluent was investigated 37 they reported that pac addition significantly increased the applicable flux in an anmbr in the absence of pac higher head loss and reduction in permeate flow was observed when flux was equal or higher than 3 6 lmh 37 which is quite close to the average flux 4 1 lmh in the present study after 6 days from the start of operation the tmp exceed the threshold level of 700 mbar and the first chemical cleaning was applied after chemical cleaning while the tmp only increased to 50 mbar at the end of 2 weeks it increased to 600 mbar in the next 2 days average membrane fouling regime was once a week and the fouled membranes were regularly cleaned chemically with 500 mg l naocl table 2 period 1 2 increasing the naocl concentration from 500 mg l to 1000 mg l in the second period did not change the membrane fouling rate on day 78 membranes were changed with the new ones and naocl concentration in the cleaning solution was kept at 1000 mg l which resulted in more effective foulant removal this decreased the membrane fouling intervals and chemical cleaning was applied once in 9 10 days this should be due to accumulation of irrecoverable foulants on the membrane due to long operation period and the use of low concentration of naocl during the cleaning operations table 2 period 1 in our previous anmbr study conducted with synthetic wastewater it was sufficient to use 300 mg l naocl for membrane cleaning purposes 8 however in the present study the use of real wastewater required cleaning with higher naocl concentrations due to more severe fouling therefore the characteristics of the wastewater have significant influence on the membrane fouling which may in turn impact the chemical cleaning frequency and the chemical type and or dosage the real wastewater used in this study caused more serious pore blocking due to complex nature higher potential of inorganic scaling on the membrane and the presence of colloidal organics regular maintenance cleaning e g once or twice a week is required in full scale plants also to avoid the accumulation of irrecoverable foulants on the membrane 38 in the last stage of operation the membranes were only physically cleaned occasionally under tap water i e between 122 and 128 days and no chemical cleaning was applied consequently as discussed later the fouling rate increased sharply and the membranes were fouled within 4 days after first cleaning and within 2 days in the subsequent cycles the reason for the fouling in a shorter time after the second physical cleaning may be due to inefficient removal of foulant from membrane surface and the accumulation of irreversible and irrecoverable foulants on the membrane table 4 3 3 fouling rates and filtration resistances the fouling rate between each cleaning periods were calculated considering the tmp elevation fig 4 the fouling rates at different operational durations are given in table 4 in the first 45 day period of the study chemical cleaning was carried out with 500 mg l naocl solution in this stage the average fouling rate was obtained as 0 063 0 007 mbar min after that the naocl concentration was increased to 1 000 mg l in the following periods the fouling rate stayed high till the 78th day when fouled membranes were replaced with new membranes after installing virgin membranes the fouling rate decreased significantly to 0 035 mbar min on day 94 and averaged 0 043 0 008 mbar min during the remaining period this decrease in the membrane fouling rate caused a significant increase in the required frequency of membrane cleaning from once in 7 days to 10 days after day 121 when only physical cleaning was applied table 2 period 4 fouling rate increased to 0 087 mbar min during the operation of anmbr gas recirculation and the intermediate filtration were applied to remove the cake layer accumulated on the membrane surface the fouling that can be removed by physical scouring and intermittent filtration is defined as reversible fouling which was calculated considering the rate of tmp elevations during the 5 min filtration cycles the calculated reversible fouling rate did not show significant variation until day 121 and averaged 7 0 0 5 mbar min after day 121 only ex situ physical cleaning was applied and no chemical cleaning was used to remove the fouling the reversible fouling rate increased to 9 15 2 47 mbar min this should be due to only partial removal of foulants i e irreversible fouling could not be removed as a result local flux was much higher compared to those observed when chemical cleanings were applied hence fouling occurred in a short period of time the resistances of fouled chemically cleaned and new membranes were also determined in order to calculate irreversible fouling rirv which can be removed by chemical cleaning and irrecoverable fouling rirc i e type of fouling that cannot be removed even by chemical cleaning table 5 although the resistances in the first and second operational periods at which different concentrations of naocl were used for membrane cleaning table 2 were similar the resistance of chemically cleaned membrane in the second stage was relatively lower which should be due to use of higher naocl concentration during the membrane cleaning in the third period of the study both fouled membrane and chemically cleaned membrane resistances were lower compared to the first and second periods which should be due to use of new membrane in the third stage of the operation 3 4 characterization of membrane foulants 3 4 1 molecular weight distribution of soluble organics the gpc analyses were conducted on the supernatant permeate and cake layer samples as illustrated in fig 5 the first gpc measurements from supernatant and permeate were conducted on day 55 although the same peaks were observed in both supernatant and permeate samples the height of the peak that appeared at 16 15th min corresponding to the high molecular weight organic 15 kda was much higher in the supernatant sample this peak almost disappeared in the permeate sample and was probably retained by the membrane or cake layer during filtration similar results have been reported in other studies 39 40 additionally the peak that appeared at 17 8th min slightly decreased in the permeate sample in the gpc measurements three high signal peaks were observed at approximately 16th 17 8th and 18 9th min corresponding to molecular weights 15 kda 2 5 kda and 0 4 kda respectively in our previous study conducted with synthetic wastewater molecules with similar weights were encountered in gpc measurements and similarly an organic molecule that appeared at 16th min was retained by the cake layer 7 the molecular weight distribution of soluble organics in the cake layers of anmbr operated was also illustrated in fig 5 both quite high and low molecular weight compounds were detected with low signal in the cake layer sample but the peak heights belonging to high molecular weight compounds were quite low the peak was observed at 11th min corresponding to the very high molecular weights of around 1000 kda this peak shows that molecules with high molecular weight compounds formed in the reactor were rejected by the membrane or cake layer in the study of okamura et al 41 quite high molecular weight organics corresponding to the around 103 105 kda were observed in the gpc measurements of the gel layer samples taken from the membrane surface they reported that this could be polysaccharide also these soluble high molecular weight organic compounds may originate from high molecular weight smp and eps cell debris 7 although the rejection of high molecular weight organic compounds originating from smp and eps improves the removal efficiency the accumulation of these compounds on the membrane surface leads to membrane fouling as reported in many studies 31 the peak corresponding to 15 kda appeared at 16 15th min was detected in the supernatant and cake layer but not in permeate hence organic molecules with 15 kda molecular weight were retained by cake layer hence although microfiltration membranes were used it behaved as ultrafiltration thanks to the development of cake layer or dynamic membrane on the membrane surface molecular weight compounds as low as 0 6 kda and 0 4 kda were detected in the cake layer which may be due to conversion of high molecular compounds to lower ones by the microbial community in the cake layer 3 4 2 ft ir analyses ft ir analyses were carried out on the two samples obtained from the cake layer on days 94 and 111 fig 6 although similar peaks were detected the peak heights observed on day 111 were higher the peaks at 3280 1 cm may be due to oh stretching indicating the presence of hydroxyl functional group 42 two sharp peaks detected at 2923 1 cm and 2854 1 cm especially on day 111 were due to aliphatic methylene bands originating from aliphatic ch stretches 42 43 ft ir analyses illustrated presence of both carbohydrate and protein like compounds in the cake layer which should be mainly due to smp and eps 4 conclusions in the study a real textile industry wastewater was fed to a lab scale anmbr and its treatment and filtration performances were investigated cod and color concentrations were decreased to around 160 mg l and 221 pt co respectively anmbr was successfully operated at 4 1 0 7 lmh with weekly maintenance cleaning increasing the naocl concentration in the chemical cleaning resulted in better cleaning efficiency and removal of pore blocking foulants gpc analysis illustrated that the cake layer developed on the membrane retained high molecular organic compounds in the supernatant and polished the permeate the results illustrated that anmbr may be used for the treatment of textile industry effluents due to relatively higher cod and color removal efficiencies achieved although sustainable flux around 4 lmh was relatively lower compared to aerobic counterparts 10 20 lmh declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

14201,the present study aimed to investigate the effects of low cost plastic char synthesized from pyrolysis of waste polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyethylene pe for adsorbing arsenic as adsorption of as under kinetic and equilibrium conditions was evaluated against changing ph 4 8 contact time 0 40 min and a dose of char 0 5 1 5 g the uptake capability was found to be in the range of 10 7 99 4 amongst all the plastic chars used pe and pvc mixed char showed the highest removal of as that ranged from 71 6 99 4 least amount of sorption was shown by pe and pet chars which was found to be in range of 12 4 32 5 the optimum equilibrium time of 20 min with acidic medium ph 6 0 at 1 5 g was the best favored dose for 99 4 adsorption of as pseudo second order rate effectively fitted well with removal kinetics whereas langmuir isotherm models fitted more accurately to the obtained results the study concluded that plastic chars have a greater possibility to act as a promising sorbent for effective removal of as keywords pe pet pvc adsorption langmuir isotherm 1 introduction arsenic as is the twentieth most abundant element in the geosphere and fourteenth in seawater 1 its contamination in nature is turning out as one of the most serious issues in some places of the earth 2 3 it is a strong cancer causing agent prompting skin liver and various lung diseases 4 5 it has been well known to cause genotoxicity cytotoxicity skin sores and peripheral vascular sickness 6 various sources comprising of man made as well as natural sources are continuously increasing the mean measure of as which was earlier evaluated to be 1 8 mg kg 1 7 the removal of as from contaminated water sites is a challenge because of the varying arsenic speciation that depends directly on the solution ph 8 in water bodies arsenite and arsenate have been perceived as major lethal types of arsenic arsenite is 25 60 times more lethal than arsenate and has been accounted to be increasingly portable in the environment 9 the concentration of as is very low to be considered as a causative factor for health issues and thus its safe limit is exceptionally low in comparison to other lethal metals 10 μg l 1 as prescribed by the world health organization 10 it is quite important for developing some efficient arsenic removal techniques from the contaminated sites the major techniques for the remediation of as predominantly include chemical oxidation chemical coagulation precipitation adsorption ion exchange reverse osmosis and membrane separation 7 8 11 14 membrane separation technique has been found effective in the removal of as in the developed countries but not in the developing countries 15 this is mainly due to the increment in the unit cost almost 10 times which renders it to be unjustifiable for the smaller treatments 16 oxidation techniques demand high energy usage which is not at all cost effective and thus it is also not feasible coagulation along with filtration is although economic but was found to often display lower efficiencies 90 16 despite high as removal efficiencies shown by all these techniques they are not preferred for higher supply systems due to the high capital and maintenance cost 17 amongst all the available techniques adsorption has been considered as the most efficient strategy in the last few decades because of the involvement of low cost during the entire process along with its efficient design and wide range of adsorbent choice 4 18 19 carbon materials have been considered as an optimal solid adsorbent due to the low cost in spite of some disadvantages like hygroscopicity and pore blocking 20 22 because of the limitations of the available techniques it was opined to use plastic chars for concurrent adsorption of as plastics have turned out as a disastrous issue to be managed and removed from the environment amongst all the solid wastes being generated 23 the ever increasing demand for plastics has prompted an increase in waste accumulation each year 24 despite a massive part of plastic waste being recycled and energy recovery is done some of them would certainly be dumped into the landfills that cause the contamination of the groundwater and also releases ozone depleting constituents into the atmosphere 25 26 it is thus not a satisfactory technique for managing these wastes also the lack of free land for disposing plastic waste along with its co related negative impact calls for an alternative method for managing the plastic wastes 25 therefore an effective method for managing and diverting them from the landfills for use as effective sorption of as was opined in the present research the present work focused on the use of plastic char as a cost effective and carbonaceous material inferred by the moderate pyrolysis of plastic waste for as removal as is known to have lethal effects on the environment as well as on human health even if found in very low quantities also the increasing load of plastics throughout the globe is a matter of concern for all although numerous sorbents have already been used for the removal of as from the contaminated sites but the use of chars prepared from these waste plastics is a matter of new concern also this would actually be a win win situation as both the issues of plastic waste management as well as the adsorption of heavy metals using an already existing resource would be quite beneficial based on the results obtained from studying the prevailing mechanisms and sorption performance of the plastic char these can effectively be used on larger scales even for the removal of other heavy metals 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials plastic chars were prepared using waste polyethylene pe polyvinyl chloride pvc and polyethylene terephthalate pet as feedstock all the plastics were then washed using soap solution and distilled water further it was air dried and grinded with the help of a mechanical grinder and then oven dried to remove all the moisture present these moisture free plastic samples were undergone through pyrolysis for the preparation of plastic char 2 2 preparation of non modified plastic char after the preparation of feedstock the samples were changed over into plastic char by pyrolysis the pyrolysis was carried out in a laboratory scale set up that contained a sample holder furnace water condenser liquid collector a flow meter and gas collector outlet in each run 50 g of the sample was placed in the reaction chamber and pyrolysed by heating the furnace pyrolysis was done in n2 atmosphere at 450 550 and 650 with heating rate of 8 min the final temperature in all the cases was maintained for 10 min of residence time the plastic chars attained were then labeled based on the combination of feedstock used and their corresponding pyrolysis temperature as presented in table 1 the obtained plastic chars were finally sieved to obtain 0 5 1 0 mm sized plastic chars finally the obtained chars were oven dried at 100 for 180 min after which they were stored in a vacuum desiccator for further use as an adsorbent 2 3 plastic char characterization the prepared chars were then characterized for obtaining their thermal degradation properties proximate ultimate carbon c nitrogen n hydrogen h and sulphur s and surface properties thermo gravimetric analyses tga of the prepared chars was done using a thermo gravimetric analyzer model dtg 60 device 27 proximate analysis was done for defining the moisture content mc fixed carbon fc volatile matter vm and ash content ac the elemental compositions were analyzed using chns elemental analyzer x ray diffraction xrd study was done for surface analysis with the help of miniflex ii rigaku 28 the brunauer emmett teller surface areas were analyzed by quanta chrome autosorb analyzer 29 30 scanning electron microscope sem characterization of the biochar samples was performed by using tescan vega 3 2 4 arsenic as adsorption measurements the batch adsorption experiments of as using plastic char samples were performed to determine the influence of contact time ph a dose of adsorbent and temperature at which char has been pyrolyzed on sorption of as all the arsenic adsorption experiments were performed by spiking a known concentration of as stock solutions at all the stages the assessment of the sorption ability of the plastic chars was performed utilizing an arsenic stock solution of 1000 ppm three doses of char i e 0 5 g 1 0 g and 1 5 g were used and each sample was maintained at three ph conditions 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 hence a total of 90 samples have been utilized to define the capacity of uptake by the plastic char samples from the arsenic stock solution a working solution of 100 ppm was made for further analyses ultimately the ph of the working solution was checked and maintained at ph 4 0 then 0 5 g of the prepared plastic char was mixed with 20 ml of 100 ppm working as solution in a 50 ml centrifuge tubes at 37 0 5 the mixture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for half an hour and filtered using membrane type syringe driven filters of 0 45 μm the filtrate collected was then used for estimating the concentration of as present using icp oes the adsorption capacity of chars was determined based on the initial as concentrations the same process was repeated at a ph of 6 and 8 with char doses of 1 0 g and 1 5 g respectively for all arsenic sorption tests blank examinations without the sorbent were incorporated as trial controls which showed no loss of as in the analyses all the sorption experiments were implemented in sets of three and their average values were used 2 5 sorption kinetics the kinetics behind the uptake of as by chars was investigated by the lagergren ho mckay models the rate of as adsorption on the plastic char was calculated using pseudo first order eq 1 31 32 1 l o g q e q t l o g q e k 1 t 2 303 pseudo second order eq 2 is of the form 33 34 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt mg g 1 represents the as adsorbed on plastic chars at equilibrium and time t respectively whereas k1 and k2 represents the rate constants 2 6 adsorption isotherms the capacity of as uptake by the plastic chars was calculated with the langmuir and freundlich isotherms the linear form of langmuir isotherm is mentioned in eq 3 35 3 c e q e c e q m 1 k l q m where qe mg g 1 is the quantity of as adsorbed ce mg l 1 represents as concentration at equilibrium while qm represents the maximum sorption capacity mg g 1 and kl is the langmuir constant the freundlich isotherm involves log qe and log ce with log kfand n being the y intercept and slope obtained from the plots respectively as mentioned in eq 4 36 37 4 i n q e i n k f 1 n i n c e where qe is the quantity of as adsorbed and ce represents the as concentration at equilibrium kf mg g 1 l 1 mg 1 n 1 is associated to sorption capacity 3 results and discussion the raw plastic samples were analyzed for studying their degradation properties using tga also the prepared chars were characterized by their proximate ultimate bet analyzes finally the prevailing mechanisms and the sorption performance of the analyzed chars was carried out the results of all these have been mentioned and discussed in the following sections 3 1 raw plastic and plastic char 3 1 1 raw plastic and plastic char properties the onset temperature tonset maximum degradation temperature tm and final degradation temperature tf of the plastic waste at the optimal heating rate 10 min 1 are presented in table 2 pe started decreasing in mass at a temperature of about 434 the maximum degradation occurred at about 484 where the degradation was completed pet showed a similar trend with pe where the thermal decomposition occurred in a temperature range of 406 441 the maximum decomposition of pvc took place at 440 the thermal degradation of all the polymers finished between the temperature ranges of 470 to 520 proximate analysis of pe pet and pvc samples had the mc from 0 60 to 2 0 indicating that the samples were rich in carbon compounds and had the possibility of forming good quality char during pyrolysis the maximum amount of ac and fc in pe was 5 89 and 9 44 wt respectively the pyrolysis of pvc produced 91 5 vm which indicates the less formation of solid products like ac and fc the elemental analysis of the plastic samples showed very low nitrogen contents but high c content ranging from 23 1 90 3 wt pvc contained the least amount of fc i e 0 32 but the c was found to be the highest i e 90 3 which proves that the amount of char formed will be less but the quality will be better due to high c content the proximate and elemental analyses of plastic wastes are presented in table 3 the surface areas of plastic char ranged from 0 1 m2 g 1 to 58 9 m2 g 1 which varied with the pyrolysis conditions and feedstock type used generally it is seen that surface area increases with an increasing temperature which corroborated with the observations of sun et al 38 the intense increase in the surface area with the temperature at which pyrolysis has been performed was mainly affected by two phases first the long carbon chains disintegrated into lighter vapors at 450 39 also the transition from the plastic chains to char adds up to an amplified surface area with increasing pyrolysis temperature 40 raw plastic material being used also governs the surface area to a pronounced degree on relating the surface area of plastic chars produced p3 c showed the least surface area of 2 18 m2 g 1 while p2 c had a maximum surface area of 9 21 m2 g 1 and pore size equivalent to 3 13 101 å the plastic char prepared from varying combinations of plastics showed great variation in the surface areas which is mainly due to the variation in the chemical and physical composition of the plastics the chars formed by mixing pet and pe have been found to have the least surface area along with less pore size 3 37 101 å as well as pore volume 3 68 10 3 cc g 1 the obtained plastic char was rich in c 41 3 84 7 while n and h contents of 0 10 2 78 and 1 83 5 17 were relatively low this was persistent with the features of the chars earlier derived by fang et al 41 3 1 2 xrd and sem analysis of plastic char the xrd pattern of the plastic chars p1 c p2 c p3 c observed from the study showed sharp diffraction crystalline peaks in the case of p1 c the spectrum showed strong peaks at around 27 4 d 3 246 å 29 2 d 3 053 å 35 9 d 2 496 å 42 9 d 2 105 å and 47 4 d 1 916 å while p2 c at 23 4 d 3

and may be associated to its presence in the raw plastics as a coloring pigment in various plastic products 42 sem images of the prepared plastic chars p1 c p2 c and p3 c have been shown in fig 2 it can be clearly seen that p1c showed smooth surfaces with pores in irregular shapes these pores were found to be somewhat long tubular structures in case of p2 c and p3 c the surface is smooth enough but the spongy pores present are not well distributed and are lesser in number also they are smaller in size this observation reveals the char to be a mesoporous structure 36 a little blur image of p3 c char was produced due to the accumulation of charge on its surface similar blur images due to charge accumulation has also been observed earlier by 43 porosity of the chars are also dependent on the pyrolysis temperature the char samples prepared at 550 temperatures i e n3 b3 and s3 were found to have more pore volume in comparison to those that were prepared at the lowest temperatures this observation is with good agreement with the study performed by shaaban et al 44 3 2 sorption of arsenic 3 2 1 influence of feedstock material on adsorption capacity the sorption process is greatly influenced by the changing feedstock type this is because of the change in the physical and chemical properties of the plastic feedstock which furthermore impacts as uptake capacity of the char the largest adsorption of as was shown by p1 b i e the char prepared by mixing pe and pvc plastic waste which ranged from 71 6 to 99 4 the plastic chars prepared from mixing pe and pet exhibited the least sorption capacity the uptake capacities of the chars are predominantly affected by the small surface areas and pore size the pe and pvc based char have the maximum surface area which is responsible for the highest amount of sorption in p1 b also the plastic chars prepared from pvc and pet p2 a p2 b and p2 c plastics also showed adsorption ranging from 62 4 to 98 7 therefore chars prepared by using pe and pvc showed the best adsorption capacity 3 2 2 influence of pyrolysis temperature the temperature at which the char has been prepared greatly influences the adsorption capacity of the plastic chars the chars prepared at a higher temperature of 550 showed a high amount of adsorption of as in comparison to those prepared at low pyrolysis temperature of 450 in contrast to the chars prepared at 650 less as was sorbed by p1 a p2 a and p3 a at all the concentrations i e 0 5 g 1 g and 1 5 g the lesser ability of these plastic chars in adsorbing as agreed to the char showing less surface area at low pyrolysis temperatures thereby decreasing the sorption efficiencies 3 2 3 influence of dose of char on the sorption the dose of 0 5 1 5 g of the plastic char on as adsorption was studied and has been shown in fig 3 the uptake efficiency of as by pe and pvc based char increased rapidly from 71 6 to 99 4 62 4 99 6 for pvc and pet and 6 76 32 6 by pe and pet as the dose increased from 0 5 to 1 0 g further rise in dose showed no significant impact on the removal of as from the media therefore the dosage of 1 5 g was selected as the optimum dosage for the study similar results have been reported earlier where increasing the dose of nanoscale zero valent iron was supported onto activated carbon nzvi ac from 0 1 3 0 g l 1 and a subsequent rise in removal of arsenic both arsenate as well as arsenite from 68 to 100 was observed by zhu et al 8 3 2 4 influence of ph on the sorption of as the solution ph has a fundamental role to play during the sorption of as even with a slight change in solution ph and surface charge of the arsenic molecules the sorption capacity of the char changes the influence of ph on the adsorption of as onto the surface of the prepared plastic chars has been shown in fig 4 the uptake efficacy of as by pe and pvc pvc and pet or pe and pet greatly varied in the ph range studied which specified the role of solution ph on the adsorption process 45 in any feedstock based chars i e whether pe and pvc pet and pvc or pe and pet ph 6 was evaluated to be more appropriate for as removal these results are somewhat similar to that of ntim and mitra 46 for as adsorption on a multiwall carbon nanotube but differs slightly from the results of liu et al 47 who reported a ph of 8 to be the most effective for as v removal by fe3o4 loaded sawdust biochar the major issues prompting the adsorption are species of as present and the surface morphology of the chars the surface of char becomes positively charged at ph 6 acidic medium and thus favors as adsorption however at ph 7 the surface of char is negatively charged and thus as adsorption decreases because of enhanced electrostatic repulsion 46 3 3 influence of contact time the influence of contact time on the sorption of as on the waste plastic based chars is shown in fig 5 it has been perceived from the study that the rate of adsorption of as on all the plastic char irrespective of the feedstock type increases with time at initial stages after the equilibrium time is reached the adsorption tends to decrease gradually this is due to the availability of free sites during the initial stages the rate of adsorption decreased after a contact time of 15 min in the same way adsorption of as onto composite adsorbent also showed increased removal with an increase in time during the initial stages 0 40 min after which the rate of removal became low and finally an equilibrium stage was reached after 60 min 48 3 4 statistical analyses statistical analysis of as sorption experiment was performed using analysis of variance anova for obtaining more information regarding the efficiency of the set parameter dose of char for sorption experiment anova has been calculated for testing the hypothesis regarding the dependency of a dose of char applied and confirmation of sorption capacity of different plastic char for as the influence of independent variables dose of applied char on the dependent variables as sorption was analyzed in the study the statistically significant values were denoted by p values the p value of the hypothesis test h β1 0 was found to be 0 74 for all the doses applied the p value 0 05 indicates an existing relationship between the as adsorption capacity and ph 6 0 dose 0 5 g 1 0 g 1 5 g and contact time 30 min the value of f for a single way adopted was found to be 0 29 which is less than the f critical value of 3 40 this indicated that the null hypothesis is rejected and the dose of the char applied plays a significant effect on the as sorption 3 5 isotherm modeling the sorption parameters attained by applying isotherm models have been presented in table 4 adsorption potentials of pe and pvc based chars were much greater when compared to that of pe and pet based chars signifying a positive role of pvc plastics for improved sorption of as as shown in fig 6 it is clear that the adsorption capacity of these chars followed langmuir isotherm and the coefficient of determination r2 ranged from 0 993 to 1 00 the langmuir isotherm implied monolayer sorption of as occurred on the consistent surface of the plastic chars conversely using plastic char made from sawdust liu et al 47 reported freundlich isotherm model at ph 8 to best fit the data a comparison between plastic char used as sorbents presented that maximum sorption by pe and pvc was moderately higher than pvc and pet 6 57 10 5 mg g 1 and pe and pet 2 42 mg g 1 aspects like species of as present quantity of char used solution ph contact time surface accessibility of char are responsible for the percentage as removal even though they do not have very high surface areas but due to the presence of the high amount of oxygen in the chars they permit adsorption of as inside the char along with sorption on the pore surface 49 3 5 1 kinetics study fig 7 shows as removal efficiencies of p1 b and p2 b as a function of time after 5 min of contact over 33 2 of as was removed by p1 b in comparison to 2 25 by p3 c 99 4 of as were removed after 15 min of contact by p1 b relative to p1 b nearly thrice amount of as was removed when the contact time was increased to 15 min the kinetics of as adsorption using the pe and pet based chars was relatively slower and less when compared with pe and pvc based chars the sorption of as onto p1 b was quite rapid at the initial dose of 0 5 and 1 5 g of char 30 6 33 3 of as uptake took place within the first 5 min fig 5 which then increased from 91 7 to 99 4 in next 15 min table 5 presents pseudo second order rate constants for removal of as by p1 b the correlation coefficient 0 99 suggested that chemisorption is the rate determining step and the kinetics would be explained best by pseudo second order model 50 3 6 comparison of plastic char with other adsorbents for arsenic removal the outcomes of the current study were compared with prevailing data concerning sorption of as on different adsorbents table 6 it was observed in the present study that plastic char p1 b showed the best results for the sorption of as furthermore yao et al 48 prepared a compound of activated carbon with iron oxide and used it for as removal it reported low sorption capacity as compared to the present work zhang et al 51 prepared ce iv doped iron oxide and reported 16 mg g 1 of removal of as at a ph range 3 7 also asif and chen 52 reported removal of as by 90 7 using rise husk as adsorbent thus plastic chars showed acceptable performance in comparison to other adsorbents overall it has been discovered from the outcomes that plastics char is a promising choice for the removal of as 4 conclusion the chars prepared from pyrolysis of the waste plastic were examined for as removal by batch sorption experiments amongst all the prepared chars p1 b was found to be most efficient in as removal having the adsorption capacities in the range 6 76 99 4 under increasing dose with a ph of 6 0 and 25 min equilibrium time the acidic media favors adsorption by chars while the increasing ph automatically decreases the adsorption from the experimental data obtained under optimized conditions i e dose varying as 0 5 g initial as concentration of 100 mg l 1 ph 4 0 and contact time of 15 min the maximum uptake of as was found to be 99 4 for p1 b char all the tested plastic chars were found to show good removal the data obtained show that as sorption on the plastic chars depends not only on the dose of the char or the solution ph but also the feedstock plastic used plays a noteworthy role towards the sorption capacities of the chars although there might be some challenges that surely needs to be addressed while implementing the use of plastic char for as sorption from aqueous or soil media the positive performance of these chars can be seen from the present study which favorably suggests to use on a larger field scale plastic chars can thereby be considered as a novel and sustainable solution towards proficient removal of as and plastic waste management declaration of competing interest there is no conflict of interest 
14201,the present study aimed to investigate the effects of low cost plastic char synthesized from pyrolysis of waste polyvinyl chloride pvc polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyethylene pe for adsorbing arsenic as adsorption of as under kinetic and equilibrium conditions was evaluated against changing ph 4 8 contact time 0 40 min and a dose of char 0 5 1 5 g the uptake capability was found to be in the range of 10 7 99 4 amongst all the plastic chars used pe and pvc mixed char showed the highest removal of as that ranged from 71 6 99 4 least amount of sorption was shown by pe and pet chars which was found to be in range of 12 4 32 5 the optimum equilibrium time of 20 min with acidic medium ph 6 0 at 1 5 g was the best favored dose for 99 4 adsorption of as pseudo second order rate effectively fitted well with removal kinetics whereas langmuir isotherm models fitted more accurately to the obtained results the study concluded that plastic chars have a greater possibility to act as a promising sorbent for effective removal of as keywords pe pet pvc adsorption langmuir isotherm 1 introduction arsenic as is the twentieth most abundant element in the geosphere and fourteenth in seawater 1 its contamination in nature is turning out as one of the most serious issues in some places of the earth 2 3 it is a strong cancer causing agent prompting skin liver and various lung diseases 4 5 it has been well known to cause genotoxicity cytotoxicity skin sores and peripheral vascular sickness 6 various sources comprising of man made as well as natural sources are continuously increasing the mean measure of as which was earlier evaluated to be 1 8 mg kg 1 7 the removal of as from contaminated water sites is a challenge because of the varying arsenic speciation that depends directly on the solution ph 8 in water bodies arsenite and arsenate have been perceived as major lethal types of arsenic arsenite is 25 60 times more lethal than arsenate and has been accounted to be increasingly portable in the environment 9 the concentration of as is very low to be considered as a causative factor for health issues and thus its safe limit is exceptionally low in comparison to other lethal metals 10 μg l 1 as prescribed by the world health organization 10 it is quite important for developing some efficient arsenic removal techniques from the contaminated sites the major techniques for the remediation of as predominantly include chemical oxidation chemical coagulation precipitation adsorption ion exchange reverse osmosis and membrane separation 7 8 11 14 membrane separation technique has been found effective in the removal of as in the developed countries but not in the developing countries 15 this is mainly due to the increment in the unit cost almost 10 times which renders it to be unjustifiable for the smaller treatments 16 oxidation techniques demand high energy usage which is not at all cost effective and thus it is also not feasible coagulation along with filtration is although economic but was found to often display lower efficiencies 90 16 despite high as removal efficiencies shown by all these techniques they are not preferred for higher supply systems due to the high capital and maintenance cost 17 amongst all the available techniques adsorption has been considered as the most efficient strategy in the last few decades because of the involvement of low cost during the entire process along with its efficient design and wide range of adsorbent choice 4 18 19 carbon materials have been considered as an optimal solid adsorbent due to the low cost in spite of some disadvantages like hygroscopicity and pore blocking 20 22 because of the limitations of the available techniques it was opined to use plastic chars for concurrent adsorption of as plastics have turned out as a disastrous issue to be managed and removed from the environment amongst all the solid wastes being generated 23 the ever increasing demand for plastics has prompted an increase in waste accumulation each year 24 despite a massive part of plastic waste being recycled and energy recovery is done some of them would certainly be dumped into the landfills that cause the contamination of the groundwater and also releases ozone depleting constituents into the atmosphere 25 26 it is thus not a satisfactory technique for managing these wastes also the lack of free land for disposing plastic waste along with its co related negative impact calls for an alternative method for managing the plastic wastes 25 therefore an effective method for managing and diverting them from the landfills for use as effective sorption of as was opined in the present research the present work focused on the use of plastic char as a cost effective and carbonaceous material inferred by the moderate pyrolysis of plastic waste for as removal as is known to have lethal effects on the environment as well as on human health even if found in very low quantities also the increasing load of plastics throughout the globe is a matter of concern for all although numerous sorbents have already been used for the removal of as from the contaminated sites but the use of chars prepared from these waste plastics is a matter of new concern also this would actually be a win win situation as both the issues of plastic waste management as well as the adsorption of heavy metals using an already existing resource would be quite beneficial based on the results obtained from studying the prevailing mechanisms and sorption performance of the plastic char these can effectively be used on larger scales even for the removal of other heavy metals 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials plastic chars were prepared using waste polyethylene pe polyvinyl chloride pvc and polyethylene terephthalate pet as feedstock all the plastics were then washed using soap solution and distilled water further it was air dried and grinded with the help of a mechanical grinder and then oven dried to remove all the moisture present these moisture free plastic samples were undergone through pyrolysis for the preparation of plastic char 2 2 preparation of non modified plastic char after the preparation of feedstock the samples were changed over into plastic char by pyrolysis the pyrolysis was carried out in a laboratory scale set up that contained a sample holder furnace water condenser liquid collector a flow meter and gas collector outlet in each run 50 g of the sample was placed in the reaction chamber and pyrolysed by heating the furnace pyrolysis was done in n2 atmosphere at 450 550 and 650 with heating rate of 8 min the final temperature in all the cases was maintained for 10 min of residence time the plastic chars attained were then labeled based on the combination of feedstock used and their corresponding pyrolysis temperature as presented in table 1 the obtained plastic chars were finally sieved to obtain 0 5 1 0 mm sized plastic chars finally the obtained chars were oven dried at 100 for 180 min after which they were stored in a vacuum desiccator for further use as an adsorbent 2 3 plastic char characterization the prepared chars were then characterized for obtaining their thermal degradation properties proximate ultimate carbon c nitrogen n hydrogen h and sulphur s and surface properties thermo gravimetric analyses tga of the prepared chars was done using a thermo gravimetric analyzer model dtg 60 device 27 proximate analysis was done for defining the moisture content mc fixed carbon fc volatile matter vm and ash content ac the elemental compositions were analyzed using chns elemental analyzer x ray diffraction xrd study was done for surface analysis with the help of miniflex ii rigaku 28 the brunauer emmett teller surface areas were analyzed by quanta chrome autosorb analyzer 29 30 scanning electron microscope sem characterization of the biochar samples was performed by using tescan vega 3 2 4 arsenic as adsorption measurements the batch adsorption experiments of as using plastic char samples were performed to determine the influence of contact time ph a dose of adsorbent and temperature at which char has been pyrolyzed on sorption of as all the arsenic adsorption experiments were performed by spiking a known concentration of as stock solutions at all the stages the assessment of the sorption ability of the plastic chars was performed utilizing an arsenic stock solution of 1000 ppm three doses of char i e 0 5 g 1 0 g and 1 5 g were used and each sample was maintained at three ph conditions 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 hence a total of 90 samples have been utilized to define the capacity of uptake by the plastic char samples from the arsenic stock solution a working solution of 100 ppm was made for further analyses ultimately the ph of the working solution was checked and maintained at ph 4 0 then 0 5 g of the prepared plastic char was mixed with 20 ml of 100 ppm working as solution in a 50 ml centrifuge tubes at 37 0 5 the mixture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for half an hour and filtered using membrane type syringe driven filters of 0 45 μm the filtrate collected was then used for estimating the concentration of as present using icp oes the adsorption capacity of chars was determined based on the initial as concentrations the same process was repeated at a ph of 6 and 8 with char doses of 1 0 g and 1 5 g respectively for all arsenic sorption tests blank examinations without the sorbent were incorporated as trial controls which showed no loss of as in the analyses all the sorption experiments were implemented in sets of three and their average values were used 2 5 sorption kinetics the kinetics behind the uptake of as by chars was investigated by the lagergren ho mckay models the rate of as adsorption on the plastic char was calculated using pseudo first order eq 1 31 32 1 l o g q e q t l o g q e k 1 t 2 303 pseudo second order eq 2 is of the form 33 34 2 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where qe and qt mg g 1 represents the as adsorbed on plastic chars at equilibrium and time t respectively whereas k1 and k2 represents the rate constants 2 6 adsorption isotherms the capacity of as uptake by the plastic chars was calculated with the langmuir and freundlich isotherms the linear form of langmuir isotherm is mentioned in eq 3 35 3 c e q e c e q m 1 k l q m where qe mg g 1 is the quantity of as adsorbed ce mg l 1 represents as concentration at equilibrium while qm represents the maximum sorption capacity mg g 1 and kl is the langmuir constant the freundlich isotherm involves log qe and log ce with log kfand n being the y intercept and slope obtained from the plots respectively as mentioned in eq 4 36 37 4 i n q e i n k f 1 n i n c e where qe is the quantity of as adsorbed and ce represents the as concentration at equilibrium kf mg g 1 l 1 mg 1 n 1 is associated to sorption capacity 3 results and discussion the raw plastic samples were analyzed for studying their degradation properties using tga also the prepared chars were characterized by their proximate ultimate bet analyzes finally the prevailing mechanisms and the sorption performance of the analyzed chars was carried out the results of all these have been mentioned and discussed in the following sections 3 1 raw plastic and plastic char 3 1 1 raw plastic and plastic char properties the onset temperature tonset maximum degradation temperature tm and final degradation temperature tf of the plastic waste at the optimal heating rate 10 min 1 are presented in table 2 pe started decreasing in mass at a temperature of about 434 the maximum degradation occurred at about 484 where the degradation was completed pet showed a similar trend with pe where the thermal decomposition occurred in a temperature range of 406 441 the maximum decomposition of pvc took place at 440 the thermal degradation of all the polymers finished between the temperature ranges of 470 to 520 proximate analysis of pe pet and pvc samples had the mc from 0 60 to 2 0 indicating that the samples were rich in carbon compounds and had the possibility of forming good quality char during pyrolysis the maximum amount of ac and fc in pe was 5 89 and 9 44 wt respectively the pyrolysis of pvc produced 91 5 vm which indicates the less formation of solid products like ac and fc the elemental analysis of the plastic samples showed very low nitrogen contents but high c content ranging from 23 1 90 3 wt pvc contained the least amount of fc i e 0 32 but the c was found to be the highest i e 90 3 which proves that the amount of char formed will be less but the quality will be better due to high c content the proximate and elemental analyses of plastic wastes are presented in table 3 the surface areas of plastic char ranged from 0 1 m2 g 1 to 58 9 m2 g 1 which varied with the pyrolysis conditions and feedstock type used generally it is seen that surface area increases with an increasing temperature which corroborated with the observations of sun et al 38 the intense increase in the surface area with the temperature at which pyrolysis has been performed was mainly affected by two phases first the long carbon chains disintegrated into lighter vapors at 450 39 also the transition from the plastic chains to char adds up to an amplified surface area with increasing pyrolysis temperature 40 raw plastic material being used also governs the surface area to a pronounced degree on relating the surface area of plastic chars produced p3 c showed the least surface area of 2 18 m2 g 1 while p2 c had a maximum surface area of 9 21 m2 g 1 and pore size equivalent to 3 13 101 å the plastic char prepared from varying combinations of plastics showed great variation in the surface areas which is mainly due to the variation in the chemical and physical composition of the plastics the chars formed by mixing pet and pe have been found to have the least surface area along with less pore size 3 37 101 å as well as pore volume 3 68 10 3 cc g 1 the obtained plastic char was rich in c 41 3 84 7 while n and h contents of 0 10 2 78 and 1 83 5 17 were relatively low this was persistent with the features of the chars earlier derived by fang et al 41 3 1 2 xrd and sem analysis of plastic char the xrd pattern of the plastic chars p1 c p2 c p3 c observed from the study showed

793 å 29 7 d 3 00 å 33 37 d 2 682 å 36 2 d 2 474 å 39 6 d 2 272 å 43 3 d 2 084 å 47 7 1 901 å and 48 7 d 1 867 å and p3 c at 29 3 d 3 039 å as shown in fig 1 these peaks were identified as rutile tio2 and may be associated to its presence in the raw plastics as a coloring pigment in various plastic products 42 sem images of the prepared plastic chars p1 c p2 c and p3 c have been shown in fig 2 it can be clearly seen that p1c showed smooth surfaces with pores in irregular shapes these pores were found to be somewhat long tubular structures in case of p2 c and p3 c the surface is smooth enough but the spongy pores present are not well distributed and are lesser in number also they are smaller in size this observation reveals the char to be a mesoporous structure 36 a little blur image of p3 c char was produced due to the accumulation of charge on its surface similar blur images due to charge accumulation has also been observed earlier by 43 porosity of the chars are also dependent on the

dose of 0 5 and 1 5 g of char 30 6 33 3 of as uptake took place within the first 5 min fig 5 which then increased from 91 7 to 99 4 in next 15 min table 5 presents pseudo second order rate constants for removal of as by p1 b the correlation coefficient 0 99 suggested that chemisorption is the rate determining step and the kinetics would be explained best by pseudo second order model 50 3 6 comparison of plastic char with other adsorbents for arsenic removal the outcomes of the current study were compared with prevailing data concerning sorption of as on different adsorbents table 6 it was observed in the present study that plastic char p1 b showed the best results for the sorption of as furthermore yao et al 48 prepared a compound of activated carbon with iron oxide and used it for as removal it reported low sorption capacity as compared to the present work zhang et al 51 prepared ce iv doped iron oxide and reported 16 mg g 1 of removal of as at a ph range 3 7 also asif and chen 52 reported removal of as by 90 7 using rise husk as adsorbent thus plastic chars showed acceptable performance in comparison to other adsorbents overall it has been discovered from the outcomes that plastics char is a promising choice for the removal of as 4 conclusion the chars prepared from pyrolysis of the waste plastic were examined for as removal by batch sorption experiments amongst all the prepared chars p1 b was found to be most efficient in as removal having the adsorption capacities in the range 6 76 99 4 under increasing dose with a ph of 6 0 and 25 min equilibrium time the acidic media favors adsorption by chars while the increasing ph automatically decreases the adsorption from the experimental data obtained under optimized conditions i e dose varying as 0 5 g initial as concentration of 100 mg l 1 ph 4 0 and contact time of 15 min the maximum uptake of as was found to be 99 4 for p1 b char all the tested plastic chars were found to show good removal the data obtained show that as sorption on the plastic chars depends not only on the dose of the char or the solution ph but also the feedstock plastic used plays a noteworthy role towards the sorption capacities of the chars although there might be some challenges that surely needs to be addressed while implementing the use of plastic char for as sorption from aqueous or soil media the positive performance of these chars can be seen from the present study which favorably suggests to use on a larger field scale plastic chars can thereby be considered as a novel and sustainable solution towards proficient removal of as and plastic waste management declaration of competing interest there is no conflict of interest 
14202,numerous pilot and computational studies have investigated effects of inlet outlet baffles and geometry on the hydraulic performance of sedimentation ponds in water and wastewater treatment plants however no full scale study has addressed buoyancy effects caused by variations in the ambient temperature and the real time temperature of the fluid at the inlet this might significantly affect the hydraulic performance of sedimentation ponds for the first time we conduct representative simulations to study effects of variations in the temperature on the hydraulic performance of a plant scale rectangular pond it is shown that even a small difference between the temperature at the inlet and the bulk flow inside the pond could augment thermal stratification as a result of buoyancy forces the results reveal that buoyancy forces in a typical pond would decrease the hydraulic retention time and the effective volume we suggest that understanding the effect of temperature profiles on the hydraulic performance of ponds should be a prerequisite for improving the design and configuration keywords water treatment ponds buoyancy thermal driven flow simulation 1 introduction application of appropriate treatment processes is essential to meet strict environmental and public health standards and regulations on drinking water turbidity is a major water quality indicator to assess efficiency of treatment processes to diminish suspended particles gravitational settling is the primary physical separation mechanism for solid particles it drastically reduces chemical and biological loadings in the treated water 1 2 the hydraulic efficiency of a sedimentation pond is affected by the geometry and configuration of the pond as well as ambient parameters thermal stratification wind flow and inappropriate hydraulic design of sedimentation ponds could increase turbulence in the flow and deteriorate the settling efficiency 3 hence the hydraulic efficiency of sedimentation ponds has received considerable attention during the recent years as one third of the water treatment cost is consumed for separation processes 4 pilot and field scale study of sedimentation basins are expensive and time demanding on the other hand computational fluid dynamics cfd methods together with advances in computing facilities such as parallel processing infrastructures facilitate cost effective prediction of fluids flow patterns and hydraulics of sedimentation ponds 5 computational studies on the hydraulics of ponds have mostly concentrated on the

of modifying the layout e g by applying baffles and changing inlet outlet and geometry configurations to improve the hydraulic performance of ponds an example is the study by goula et al 2008 who simulated the effect of baffle implementation on the settling efficiency it was shown that appropriate application of baffles in a circular settling tank could increase the settling rate of fine particles 5 goodarzi et al 2018 conducted a number of simulations to address the effect of baffles on the hydraulics and settling efficiency of rectangular ponds in a windy climate 7 similar results and findings were reported in other studies 7 11 however neither of these computational studies addressed the effect of thermal stratification on the hydraulic performance of ponds the hydrodynamics of a pond is significantly affected by characteristics of the inlet and variations in the vertical density profile of the fluid a non uniform temperature profile as the major cause of stratification is subjected to considerable fluctuations due to e g changes in the ambient conditions 12 temporal and spatial extent of heterogeneity in the temperature is a function of the magnitude of mixing 13 14 experimental studies on thermally stratified flows have demonstrated a substantial reduction in the hydraulic performance of ponds 15 16 in a pilot study hendi et al 2018 investigated buoyancy driven flows caused by temperature difference between the bulk flow inside a pond and the inflow the results demonstrated that thermal driven flows increase the chance of short circuiting and deteriorate the hydraulic performance of the pond 17 in a computational study temperature profiles in a circular sedimentation tank were investigated it was shown that an infinitesimal thermal difference is sufficient to generate a density driven flow 18 computational and numerical studies on sedimentation ponds have rarely addressed the effect of temperature on the hydraulic efficiency of ponds for the

as the initial condition the simulation of the flow field continues until the steady state condition is met which takes a simulation time around 3 5 times of nominal hydraulic retention time we then perform a tracer study to investigate the hydrodynamics of the pond including the retention times and dead zones 27 dynamic flow method is applied in which the continuity rans equations and scalar

with three different resolutions consist of 1 041k 690k and 1 250k hexahedron grid cells the velocity profiles in the sedimentation pond introduced in alighardashi et al 2019 19 were simulated the same configuration is also used to conduct the simulations in this paper the pond is a 3 m wide 35 m long and 3 m deep with a horizontal flow rate equal to 0 03245 m s more details can be found in the original study the results fig 4 show a slight different in the water velocity profile for the different meshes applied nevertheless all the three meshes produced acceptable results compared to the results in the original study the first mesh comprising 1 041k grid cells were then used to simulate the four cases of this study second we resembled the study in lui et al 2009 31 this is a lab scale experiment with a two dimensional laser doppler velocimetry to measure water flow field and mean velocity in a pond with 2 5 m length and 0 075 m height case 3 in the original study the result of our openfoam simulation versus the original measurements is depicted in fig 5 and show good agreement 4 results the output from the model are text based files including temporal and spatial values of calculated velocities pressures temperatures and concentrations we processed and visualized the output files by using the open source post processor paraview 32 below we provide the visualized data and discuss the results of the simulations 4 1 effect of temperature variations on hrtr for all the cases introduced in section 2 2 the water flow was simulated in the transient mode for at least 3 5 times of hydraulic retention time of the pond until the velocities and pressures reached a steady state even for the cases with a time dependent temperature at the inlet cases 2 4 the final simulations start from this steady state as the initial condition a passive scalar was then injected at the inlet time 8 a m the total injection duration was 10 s and the concentration of the tracer in the injected volume was equal to 1 unit mass m3 the width wise averaged concentration of the tracer was continuously calculated at the outlet residence time distributions rtd plots of four cases are shown in fig 6 detailed analysis of the data in fig 6 shows that the short circuiting problem is more augmented for cases 2 4 compared to case 1 as also seen in table 3 see also eq 13 this is mainly due to the greater thermal stratification caused by the inlet condition and augmented by the varying wall temperatures in these cases fig 6 shows that the highest maximum of concentration at the outlet is observed for case 2 this highlights a more pronounced stratification or a more significant short circuiting effect as a result of a greater difference in the temperature profile see also table 2 the wider extent of the concentration profile in case 1 also represents a longer hrt in comparison to the other cases as also reported in table 3 hydraulic characteristics of all the simulation cases are listed in table 3 more visible effects on the hrt is observed for case 2 despite the variations of the inlet temperature for this case were less than the counterpart values for cases 3 and 4 case 2 experienced a steeper temperature profile on the walls which seems to be the dominant factor in reducing hrt indeed the simultaneous interaction between the temperature profile on the walls and the temporal changes of the temperature at the inlet caused 16 reduction in hrt for case 2 compared to the results in 18 where no temperature differences existed short circuiting is also more augmented in case 2 the minimum value for e in table 3 due to the greater thermal stratification 4 2 velocity and temperature profiles the simulations highlighted the effect of variations in the temperature on the formation of thermal stratification in the pond fig 7 depicts the depth wise temperature profiles at different locations of the pond for all the cases it is observed that the difference between the ambient and inflow temperature causes a thermal stratification in the pond there is a clear decreasing trend in the vertical differences of the temperature along the pond close to the inlet the depth wise temperature difference is about 2 5 degrees celsius and it depletes to 1 near the outlet this implied that thermal stratification is more pronounced at entrance of the pond due to the differences between the temperature of the flow at the inlet and the bulk flow in case 2 4 thermal stratification is more significant and vertical temperature gradients are greater than case 1 fig 7 an increase in the temperature difference caused more buoyancy effects and disturbed the flow pattern figs 8 and 9 show the magnitude of the velocity vectors for all the cases clearly visualizing a preferential horizontal flow at the surface this is in a good agreement with the experimental study in hendi et al 2018 17 figs 10 and 11 also depict the flow streamlines for all the cases it is seen that the effect of thermal stratification results in a considerable portion of the pond to behave as a dead zones the figures also show the preferential upwards pattern of the flow filed across the pond 5 conclusions the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of ambient and inlet temperature variations on the hydraulic performance of a typical rectangular pond the findings suggested that considering temporal and spatial variations in the temperature profiles of the flow and the boundaries might have considerable effects on understanding the hydraulic performance the simulations here showed that including the inlet and ambient temperature profiles would reduce around 16 of the hydraulic retention time the buoyancy forces also led to the deterioration of the other indicators such as short circuiting as a complementary work to the existing literature the study showed that in addition to the inlet outlet baffles and wind effects temperature variations should also be considered in optimal design and operation of water and wastewater treatment ponds the computational approach and the resources used here shows that the representative simulations for such designs are affordable proper design would lead to a potential decrease to the consumption of chemicals such as coagulants hence less sludge formation and improve

results presented are the average of the three trials statistical analysis was performed using the graph pad prism 7 software at 5 significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of moringa oleifera seeds protein fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of extracted protein was performed to identify the different functional groups on mop surface from ftir spectrum shown in fig 1 it is seen a broad absorption band at 3404 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of oh in alcohol the peaks at 2912 cm 1 and 2850 cm 1 are attributed to the c h aliphatic vibration 29 the absorption peaks observed at 1643 cm 1 and 1532 cm 1 are assigned to the co vibration in amide i and amide ii respectively which confirms the structure of protein in the m oleifera seeds 30 the peaks at 1139 cm 1 760 cm 1 are characteristics to the absorption of α glycosidic and the stretching vibration of coc which are the typical bands of polysaccharide 31 32 the morphology of mop was observed by scanning electron microscopy the images obtained for two magnifications 500x and 2000x are shown in fig 2 it is observed that mop exhibited a heterogeneous morphology characterized by a rougher surface with blocks of irregular shapes and several pores of varying sizes the presence of these pores may facilitate the removal of wastewater pollutants by adsorption the total protein content mop was quantified by the biuret method and was 2932 5 17 67 mg l 1 the molecular size of protein was determined by electrophoresis sds page the sds page results displayed in fig 3 revealed two strong bands around 25 kda and 37 kda which suggesting that mop was composed by dimeric protein with mean molecular weight of 31 5 kda the results were in the best agreement with the earlier reported on m oleifera the molecular weights of coagulating protein were 26 5 kda and 30 kda 31 33 3 2 quality of water samples the characteristics of water samples used in this study are displayed in table 1 the results show that the high value of hw samples temperature of 29 8 c is mainly due to the ambient temperature of the study area which could favor the microbial development the ph of samples was slightly basic suggesting the development of algae 34 the samples are slightly turbid and moderately mineralized the small amount of dissolved oxygen 0 27 mg l 1 and the high levels of cod 238 mg l 1 bod5 132 21 mg l 1 and uv254 0 282 show that the samples were seriously polluted by pathogenic bacteria and also suggest that the bacteria used the dissolved oxygen for organic matters degradation bacteria such as e coli p aeruginosa s aureus salmonella spp and v cholerae from hw samples had very higher values than the values defined in the standard 35 in addition the bacteria used the dissolved oxygen for the nitrification of no3 ion to no2 ion which justified the low concentration of no3 ion finally based on the results it clearly appeared that the hw samples were polluted by pathogenic bacteria and must be treated before their disposal in environment thus in this work turbidity cod uv254 e coli p aeruginosa and v cholerae were chosen as parameters to investigate the potential of extracted mop and prepared mop pacl coagulant through the coagulation process 3 3 effects of moringa oleifera seeds protein on turbidity cod and uv254 removal efficiency jar tests with mop were conducted using synthetic water and hospital wastewater samples the results obtained for the removal of turbidity cod and uv254 were showed in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4a that the plots turbidity removal against coagulant dose have the same tend regardless the ph and the samples nature the removal efficiency of turbidity from sw samples increased from 37 26 to 82 28 with increasing of the coagulant dosage from 50 mg l 1 to 400 mg l 1 at ph 6 while at ph 8 the turbidity uptake rises from 30 07 to 48 14 at the same mop dose the jar test experiments performed with hw samples showed an increase in turbidity removal rate from19 99 to 64 at natural ph of 7 37 when the mop dose enhanced from 20 mg l 1 to 400 mg l 1 the results also revealed that the turbidity removal rate at ph 6 was higher than at ph 7 37 and ph 8 furthermore it has been reported that the isoelectric point of coagulating protein of m oleifera seeds was between 10 and 11 15 so at ph 10 the nitrogen atom from dimeric protein of mop would accept a proton from water samples and the mop surface became positively charged when mop is introduced into the water samples electrostatic attraction occurred between the negative load of pollutant particles from the samples and the positive load of dimeric protein from mop surface which leads to the aggregation of the pollutant molecules and their flocculation and sedimentation thereby the removal of turbidity from water samples by mop would take place by charge neutralization however given the pores observed on the mop morphology the possibly mechanisms whereby the pollutants from water samples have been removed by mop are dominated by adsorption and charge neutralization 15 36 from the results shown in fig 4b the removal percentage of cod from sw samples increased from 18 18 to 45 45 at ph 6 and from 18 18 to 36 25 at ph 8 with rising of mop dosage from 50 mg l 1 to 350 mg l 1 when the experiments were carried out with hw samples the cod removal efficiency enhanced from 11 53 to 38 36 with increasing in mop dosage from 20 mg l 1 to 320 mg l 1 furthermore the removal efficiency of uv254 increased from 16 91 to 36 27 at ph 6 and from 11 94 to 33 13 at ph 8 while it is seen a low uptake of uv254 from hw samples fig 4c which suggesting that hw samples contain the large amount of aromatic organic matter 3 4 effects of mop pacl on cod turbidity and uv254 removal efficiency the results of turbidity removal with mop pacl coagulant are shown in fig 5 the results highlighted that the turbidity removal efficiency increased with increasing in the coagulant dosage and the al mop ratio it is also showed that the turbidity uptake of 88 10 95 05 and 97 31 from sw samples were reached at ph 6 with al dose in mop pacl coagulant of 4 27 mg l 1 and using al mop ratios of 0 135 0 27 and 0 54 respectively fig 5a however when the assays were conducted using sw samples at ph 8 fig 5b and hw samples fig 5c it was observed a slight decrease compared to the obtained results at 6 ph the maximum of removed turbidity 90 45 and 73 80 were occurred at al dosage of 21 6 mg l 1 using sw samples at ph 8 and 10 80 mg l 1 with hw samples at al mop ratio of 0 27 the results also revealed that the mop pacl coagulant were really improved the turbidity removing with low al mop ratio of 0 27 from the results shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the rate of cod removed increased with increasing of the al dosage at ph 6 the maximum cod removed 59 52 from hs samples was achieved at al dose of 4 32 mg l 1 in mop pacl coagulant with al mop ratio of 0 54 fig 6a however the cod removal efficiency of 58 62 from sw samples at ph 8 and 50 from hw samples were reached using al mop ratio of 0 27 with al dosages of 21 70 mg l 1 and 10 80 mg l 1 respectively it appeared from the results that the rate of cod removed using mop pacl coagulant was better than the level with mop used as single coagulant the results displayed in fig 7 show a rising in the uv254 removal efficiency with increase in the al mop ratios thus at ph 6 70 07 and 78 91 of uv254 were removed using mop pacl coagulant with al mop ratios of 0 135 and 0 27 at al dosage of 4 32 mg l 1 fig 7a when the assays were carried out using sw samples at ph 8 fig 7b the uv254 removal of 57 99 with al mop ratio of 0 135 and 74 30 with 0 27 ratio were obtained using al doses of 10 69 mg l 1 and 16 20 mg l 1 respectively while 52 68 of uv254 was removed from hw samples using 0 27 ratio at al dose of 10 80 mg l 1 the results highlighted that the coating of pacl in mop leads to improvement of effectiveness in the pollutants removing from contaminated water 3 5 antibacterial activity the antibacterial efficiency of mop and mop pacl coagulants were tested against bacteria such as e coli v cholerae and p aeruginosa strains the results shown in fig 8 a revealed that the removal percentage of bacteria increase with increasing in the mop dosage so it was also observed a rising in removal efficiency from 11 42 to 75 71 against e coli 18 91 to 76 81 against v cholerae and 33 33 to 88 33 against p aeruginosa strains when increasing of the mop dosage from 20 mg l 1 to 400 mg l 1 the results obtained in this study were compared to the literature values for the removal efficiency in bacteria caused by m oleifera seeds morgan et al 37 reported 87 against e coli removed at 600 mg l 1 while 97 40 against salmonella and shigella was observed by vunain et al 22 the efficiency bacteria removed by mop may be explained on the one hand by coagulation process which can remove the microorganisms associated with turbidity from water samples through the flocculation and sedimentation processes on the other hand the m oleifera coagulating protein can destroy the inner and outer membranes of bacteria cells by the antioxidant compound 4 α l rhamnosyloxy benzyl isothiocyanate molecules 38 the results of assays performed with the mop pacl composite coagulant revealed that the antibacterial efficacy of composite coagulant increases with increasing of al mop ratio and al dosage from each composite coagulant from the results shown in fig 8b it is observed that the removal rate enhanced from 31 77 to 66 35 against e coli 53 22 to 76 29 against v cholerae and 22 22 to 77 78 against p aeruginosa strains with al mop ratio of 0 135 at al dosage in mop pacl rising from 1 78 mg l 1 to 7 128 mg l 1 the al mop ratios of 0 27 and 0 54 were effectively improved the rate of bacteria removed with 81 5 to 95 75 against e coli 93 6à to 98 41 against v cholerae and 62 06 to 86 21 against p aeruginosa strains with 0 27 ratio at al dose rising from 2 70 mg l 1 to 10 8 mg l 1 fig 8c moreover 0 54 ratio caused removal rate of 75 11 to 79 55 against e coli 93 33 to 98 66 against v cholerae and 65 to 100 against p aeruginosa strains at al dosage in mop pacl increased from 3 62 mg l 1 to 14 47 mg l 1 fig 8d the results also revealed that the al mop ratio of 0 135 showed the same removal efficiency as mop but the best antibacterial potential was occurred with al mop ratio of 0 27 finally the antibacterial activities of mop and mop pacl were also compared against antibiotic resistant bacteria strains such as p aeruginosa and e coli strains isolated from hs wastewater samples the results displayed in fig 9 and table 2 exhibited the antibacterial properties of tested coagulants marked by an inhibition zone with mean diameter of 16 mm against p aeruginosa and 15 mm against e coli strains with mop 17 mm against p aeruginosa and 16 mm against e coli strains with al mop ratio of 0 135 20 mm against p aeruginosa and 16 mm against e coli strains with al mop ratio of 0 27 and 16 mm against p aeruginosa and 17 mm against e coli strains with al mop ratio of 0 54 these results also confirmed that al mop ratio of 0 27 presents the best antibacterial effectiveness however the antibacterial potential of mop was in best agreement with inhibition zone of 28 75 mm against e coli strain and 29 75 mm against p aeruginosa strain reported by virk et al 39 with extract concentration of 100 mg ml 1 which was higher than the extract concentration of 10 mg ml 1 used in the present study furthermore the inhibition zone obtained with mop pacl was also in accordance with 15 mm reported by katata seru et al 24 for antibacterial effect of mop ferric chloride composite coagulant against e coli strain the results also highlighted that mop and mop pacl coagulants used in this study presented the antibacterial property as amikacin and ciprofloxacin antibiotics against antibiotic resistant bacteria strains 4 conclusions wastewater samples from the departmental hospital center of atakora in benin were collected characterized and then treated using m oleifera seeds protein mop as single coagulant and then as based composite coagulant at polyaluminum chloride pacl the results revealed a removal efficiency of 64 turbidity 16 54 uv254 38 36 cod 75 71 against e coli 76 82 against v cholerae and 88 83 against p aeruginosa strains using mop when mop was used as coagulating aid to pacl the removal rates of 73 80 turbidity 50 cod 52 68 uv254 95 75 against e coli 98 40 against v cholerae and 86 21 against p aeruginosa strains were obtained using al mop ratio of 0 27 the antibacterial tests investigated revealed that 0 27 ratio had a best antibacterial potential with inhibition zone of 20 mm against p aeruginosa and 16 mm against e coli strains results from this study also shown that mop pacl composite coagulant well improved the treated water quality in addition 0 27 ratio appeared as the best suitable for the achievement in eliminating of the pollutants characterizing our wastewater samples due to its less aluminum and more mop amount content so the resulting sludge from its use would present high biodegradability index than those with higher ratios declaration of competing interest we know of no conflicts of interest associated with this

composite coagulant were investigated against p aeruginosa and e coli strains isolated from hs samples according to the standard kirby bauer disc diffusion method reported by katata seru et al 24 the bacteria strains were suspended in 1 ml of nacl 0 9 and then swabbed on the muller hinton agar mha plates using sterile cotton swab the sterile wattman filter paper discs at mean diameter of 6 mm were

of inhibition zone was measured the standard antibiotics such as oxytetracycline metronidazole erythromycin ampicillin cotrimaxazole amikacin and ciprofloxacin were used as control 2 6 jar test procedures the jar test experiments were carried out on a fc6s six paddle stirrer flocculator velp scientifica italy 1 l of water sample was stirring rapidly at 200 rpm for 1 min then a certain amount of mop or mop pacl coagulant was pipetted into water sample then the mixture continued to stirred rapidly at 200 rpm further 3 min and then the speed of the mixer was reduced to 45 rpm for another 30

where ni and nf are the initial and the final value measured of the parameter before and after the coagulation flocculation process 2 7 statistical analysis each trial was replicated three times the results presented are the average of the three trials statistical analysis was performed using the graph pad prism 7 software at 5 significance 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of moringa oleifera seeds protein fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of extracted protein was performed to identify the different functional groups on mop surface from ftir spectrum shown in fig 1 it is seen a broad absorption band at 3404 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of oh in alcohol the peaks at 2912 cm 1 and 2850 cm 1 are attributed to the c h aliphatic vibration 29 the absorption peaks observed at 1643 cm 1 and 1532 cm 1 are assigned to the co vibration in amide i and amide ii respectively which confirms the structure of protein in the m oleifera seeds 30 the peaks at 1139 cm 1 760 cm 1 are characteristics to the absorption of α glycosidic and the stretching vibration of coc which are the typical bands of polysaccharide 31 32 the morphology of mop was observed by scanning electron microscopy the images obtained for two magnifications 500x and 2000x are shown in fig 2 it is observed that mop exhibited a heterogeneous morphology characterized by a rougher surface with blocks of irregular shapes and several pores of varying sizes the presence of these pores may facilitate the removal of wastewater pollutants by adsorption the total protein content mop was quantified by the biuret method and was 2932 5 17 67 mg l 1 the molecular size of protein was determined by electrophoresis sds page the sds page results displayed in fig 3 revealed two strong bands around 25 kda and 37 kda which suggesting that mop was composed by dimeric protein with mean molecular weight of 31 5 kda the results were in the best agreement with the earlier reported on m oleifera the molecular weights of coagulating protein were 26 5 kda and 30 kda 31 33 3 2 quality of water samples the characteristics of water samples used in this study are displayed in table 1 the results show that the high value of hw samples temperature of 29 8 c is mainly due to the ambient temperature of the study area which could favor the microbial development the ph of samples was slightly basic suggesting the development of algae 34 the samples are slightly turbid and moderately mineralized the small amount of dissolved oxygen 0 27 mg l 1 and the high levels of cod 238 mg l 1 bod5 132 21 mg l 1 and uv254 0 282 show that the samples were seriously polluted by pathogenic bacteria and also suggest that the bacteria used the dissolved oxygen for organic matters degradation bacteria such as e coli p aeruginosa s aureus salmonella spp and v cholerae from hw samples had very higher values than the values defined in the standard 35 in addition the bacteria used the dissolved oxygen for the nitrification of no3 ion to no2 ion which justified the low concentration of no3 ion finally based on the results it clearly appeared that the hw samples were polluted by pathogenic bacteria and must be treated before their disposal in environment thus in this work turbidity cod uv254 e coli p aeruginosa and v cholerae were chosen as parameters to investigate the potential of extracted mop and prepared mop pacl coagulant through the coagulation process 3 3 effects of moringa oleifera seeds protein on turbidity cod and uv254 removal efficiency jar tests with mop were conducted using synthetic water and hospital wastewater samples the results obtained for the removal of turbidity cod and uv254 were showed in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4a that the plots turbidity removal against coagulant dose have the same tend regardless the ph and the samples nature the removal efficiency of turbidity from sw samples increased from 37 26 to 82 28 with increasing of the coagulant dosage from 50 mg l 1 to 400 mg l 1 at ph 6 while at ph 8 the turbidity uptake rises from 30 07 to 48 14 at the same mop dose the jar test experiments performed with hw samples showed an increase in turbidity removal rate from19 99 to 64 at natural ph of 7 37 when the mop dose enhanced from 20 mg l 1 to 400 mg l 1 the results also revealed that the turbidity removal rate at ph 6 was higher than at ph 7 37 and ph 8 furthermore it has been reported that the isoelectric point of coagulating protein of m oleifera seeds was between 10 and 11 15 so at ph 10 the nitrogen atom from dimeric protein of mop would accept a proton from water samples and the mop surface became positively charged when mop is introduced into the water samples electrostatic attraction occurred between the negative load of pollutant particles from the samples and the positive load of dimeric protein from mop surface which leads to the aggregation of the pollutant molecules and their flocculation and sedimentation thereby the removal of turbidity from water samples by mop would take place by charge neutralization however given the pores observed on the mop morphology the possibly mechanisms whereby the pollutants from water samples have been removed by mop are dominated by adsorption and charge neutralization 15 36 from the results shown in fig 4b the removal percentage of cod from sw samples increased from 18 18 to 45 45 at ph 6 and from 18 18 to 36 25 at ph 8 with rising of mop dosage from 50 mg l 1 to 350 mg l 1 when the experiments were carried out with hw samples the cod removal efficiency enhanced from 11 53 to 38 36 with increasing in mop dosage from 20 mg l 1 to 320 mg l 1 furthermore the removal efficiency of uv254 increased from 16 91 to 36 27 at ph 6 and from 11 94 to 33 13 at ph 8 while it is seen a low uptake of uv254 from hw samples fig 4c which suggesting that hw samples contain the large amount of aromatic organic matter 3 4 effects of mop pacl on cod turbidity and uv254 removal efficiency the results of turbidity removal with mop pacl coagulant are shown in fig 5 the results highlighted that the turbidity removal efficiency increased with increasing in the coagulant dosage and the al mop ratio it is also showed that the turbidity uptake of 88 10 95 05 and 97 31 from sw samples were reached at ph 6 with al dose in mop pacl coagulant of 4 27 mg l 1 and using al mop ratios of 0 135 0 27 and 0 54 respectively fig 5a however when the assays were conducted using sw samples at ph 8 fig 5b and hw samples fig 5c it was observed a slight decrease compared to the obtained results at 6 ph the maximum of removed turbidity 90 45 and 73 80 were occurred at al dosage of 21 6 mg l 1 using sw samples at ph 8 and 10 80 mg l 1 with hw samples at al mop ratio of 0 27 the results also revealed that the mop pacl coagulant were really improved the turbidity removing with low al mop ratio of 0 27 from the results shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the rate of cod removed increased with increasing of the al dosage at ph 6 the maximum cod removed 59 52 from hs samples was achieved at al dose of 4 32 mg l 1 in mop pacl coagulant with al mop ratio of 0 54 fig 6a however the cod removal efficiency of 58 62 from sw samples at ph 8 and 50 from hw samples were reached using al mop ratio of 0 27 with al dosages of 21 70 mg l 1 and 10 80 mg l 1 respectively it appeared from the results that the rate of cod removed using mop pacl coagulant was better than the level with mop used as single coagulant the results displayed in fig 7 show a rising in the uv254 removal efficiency with increase in the al mop ratios thus at ph 6 70 07 and 78 91 of uv254 were removed using mop pacl coagulant with al mop ratios of 0 135 and 0 27 at al dosage of 4 32 mg l 1 fig 7a when the assays were carried out using sw samples at ph 8 fig 7b the uv254 removal of 57 99 with al mop ratio of 0 135 and 74 30 with 0 27 ratio were obtained using al doses of 10 69 mg l 1 and 16 20 mg l 1 respectively while 52 68 of uv254 was removed from hw samples using 0 27 ratio at al dose of 10 80 mg l 1 the results highlighted that the coating of pacl in mop leads to improvement of effectiveness in the pollutants removing from contaminated water 3 5 antibacterial activity the antibacterial efficiency of mop and mop pacl coagulants were tested against bacteria such as e coli v cholerae and p aeruginosa strains the results shown in fig 8 a revealed that the removal percentage of bacteria increase with increasing in the mop dosage so it was also observed a rising in removal efficiency from 11 42 to 75 71 against e coli 18 91 to 76 81 against v cholerae and 33 33 to 88 33 against p aeruginosa strains when increasing of the mop dosage from 20 mg l 1 to 400 mg l 1 the results obtained in this study were compared to the literature values for the removal efficiency in bacteria caused by m oleifera seeds morgan et al 37 reported 87 against e coli removed at 600 mg l 1 while 97 40 against salmonella and shigella was observed by vunain et al 22 the efficiency bacteria removed by mop may be explained on the one hand by coagulation process which can remove the microorganisms associated with turbidity from water samples through the flocculation and sedimentation processes on the other hand the m oleifera coagulating protein can destroy the inner and outer membranes of bacteria cells by the antioxidant compound 4 α l rhamnosyloxy benzyl isothiocyanate molecules 38 the results of assays performed with the mop pacl composite coagulant revealed that the antibacterial efficacy of composite coagulant increases with increasing of al mop ratio and al dosage from each composite coagulant from the results shown in fig 8b it is observed that the removal rate enhanced from 31 77 to 66 35 against e coli 53 22 to 76 29 against v cholerae and 22 22 to 77 78 against p aeruginosa strains with al mop ratio of 0 135 at al dosage in mop pacl rising from 1 78 mg l 1 to 7 128 mg l 1 the al mop ratios of 0 27 and 0 54 were effectively improved the rate of bacteria removed with 81 5 to 95 75 against e coli 93 6à to 98 41 against v cholerae and 62 06 to 86 21 against p aeruginosa strains with 0 27 ratio at al dose rising from 2 70 mg l 1 to 10 8 mg l 1 fig 8c moreover 0 54 ratio caused removal rate of 75 11 to 79 55 against e coli 93 33 to 98 66 against v cholerae and 65 to 100 against p aeruginosa strains at al dosage in mop pacl increased from 3 62 mg l 1 to 14 47 mg l 1 fig 8d the results also revealed that the al mop ratio of 0 135 showed the same removal efficiency as mop but the best antibacterial potential was occurred with al mop ratio of 0 27 finally the antibacterial activities of mop and mop pacl were also compared against antibiotic resistant bacteria strains such as p aeruginosa and e coli strains isolated from hs wastewater samples the results displayed in fig 9 and table 2 exhibited the antibacterial properties of tested coagulants marked by an inhibition zone with mean diameter of 16 mm against p aeruginosa and 15 mm against e coli strains with mop 17 mm against p aeruginosa and 16 mm against e coli strains with al mop ratio of 0 135 20 mm against p aeruginosa and 16 mm against e coli strains with al mop ratio of 0 27 and 16 mm against p aeruginosa and 17 mm against e coli strains with al mop ratio of 0 54 these results also confirmed that al mop ratio of 0 27 presents the best antibacterial effectiveness however the antibacterial potential of mop was in best agreement with inhibition zone of 28 75 mm against e coli strain and 29 75 mm against p aeruginosa strain reported by virk et al 39 with extract concentration of 100 mg ml 1 which was higher than the extract concentration of 10 mg ml 1 used in the present study furthermore the inhibition zone obtained with mop pacl was also in accordance with 15 mm reported by katata seru et al 24 for antibacterial effect of mop ferric chloride composite coagulant against e coli strain the results also highlighted that mop and mop pacl coagulants used in this study presented the antibacterial property as amikacin and ciprofloxacin antibiotics against antibiotic resistant bacteria strains 4 conclusions wastewater samples from the departmental hospital center of atakora in benin were collected characterized and then treated using m oleifera seeds protein mop as single coagulant and then as based composite coagulant at polyaluminum chloride pacl the results revealed a removal efficiency of 64 turbidity 16 54 uv254 38 36 cod 75 71 against e coli 76 82 against v cholerae and 88 83 against p aeruginosa strains using mop when mop was used as coagulating aid to pacl the removal rates of 73 80 turbidity 50 cod 52 68 uv254 95 75 against e coli 98 40 against v cholerae and 86 21 against p aeruginosa strains were obtained using al mop ratio of 0 27 the antibacterial tests investigated revealed that 0 27 ratio had a best antibacterial potential with inhibition zone of 20 mm against p aeruginosa and 16 mm against e coli strains results from this study also shown that mop pacl composite coagulant well improved the treated water quality in addition 0 27 ratio appeared as the best suitable for the achievement in eliminating of the pollutants characterizing our wastewater samples due to its less aluminum and more mop amount content so the resulting sludge from its use would present high biodegradability index than those with higher ratios declaration of competing interest we know of no conflicts of interest associated with this

14204,the responses of microbial community structures and bacterial interactions of anammox process to hydrodynamic wash was investigated based on the operation of three identical anammox reactors with the same nitrogen loading rate we found that though the three reactors achieved comparable nitrogen removal performance during the whole operation period the average specific anammox activities saas increased with decreasing hydraulic retention time hrt resulting in saas of 64 69 73 99 and 119 12 mg n g vss d at hrt of 4 2 and 1 h respectively the bacterial diversity was observed to increase with decreasing hrt moreover significant p 0 001 differences in microbial compositions were found among the three reactors demonstrating that the hydrodynamic wash played an important role in determining the microbial community structure of anammox process taxonomic analysis revealed that the anammox like bacteria in the reactors subjected to weaker hydrodynamic wash were consistently dominated by ca jettenia whereas a population shift from ca jettenia to ca brocadia was observed in the reactor with a strong hydrodynamic wash additionally network analysis showed that hydrodynamic wash greatly altered the species species interactions and the ecological roles of individual otus and key microbial populations overall the results obtained in this study highlight the importance of hydrodynamic wash in determining the bacterial activity community structure and species interactions of anammox process keywords anammox hydrodynamic wash microbial community bacterial interactions 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox has been documented as a very promising option for nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment 1 3 it offers several advantages over the conventional nitrification denitrification technologies such as higher nitrogen removal rate lower operational cost and smaller footprint 4 over the past decade anammox based processes have been extensively implemented in the treatment of ammonium rich wastewaters such as industrial wastewater and the sidestream of municipal wastewater treatment plants 5 in recent years the application of anammox based processes has been extended to mainstream wastewater treatment plants 6 9 to aid in achieving an energy neutral operation though anammox is a promising nitrogen removal process anammox bacteria show a high sensitivity to the changing environmental conditions such as temperature salinity substrate concentration organic matters 5 10 etc crucially these environmental variables could interact with each other in a number of ways 11 leading to fluctuation of nitrogen removal performance during long term operation apart from the environmental variables manipulable operational parameters can also play significant roles in affecting the anammox based processes in practice due to the long doubling time of anammox bacteria the anammox reactors are operated at relatively long solids retention time srt in order to increase the biomass concentration in the system an efficient alternative strategy to improve anammox biomass retention is the use of biofilm and granular systems 12 in biofilm and granular systems the formation of compact aggregates increases the settling velocity of the anammox biomass and improves the biomass retention hydrodynamic conditions play significant roles in affecting the biofilm formation and sludge granulation indeed more compact and dense biofilm and granular can be formed under relatively high hydrodynamic stress 2 furthermore hydrodynamic wash has significant influence on biomass characteristic mass transfer activity and metabolic behaviors of anammox consortia 2 13 15 therefore from an engineering point of view hydrodynamic condition can be manipulated as an efficient operational parameter to enhance the reactor performance previous studies suggested that the variation in hrt can result in differences in srt biomass decay yield and the accumulation of metabolic products and consequently influence the activity of anammox bacteria and reactor performance 2 15 16 for instance zhang et al 17 demonstrated that an extended hrt resulted in accumulated soluble microbial products which weakened the activity and tolerance ability of anammox bacteria more recently by using lc ms based metabolomic analysis guo et al 18 reported that the anammox metabolic activity gradually increased with decreasing hrt from 36 h to 1 h however guo et al 19 reported that the activity of anammox bacteria was sensitive to the hydraulic shocks with the specific anammox activity saa decreased significantly as the hrt decreased in comparison chen et al 20 reported that the performance of the anammox reactor was not significantly affected by transient hydraulic shock overall the reported results differed or were even contradictory because of different operational conditions particularly for the nitrogen loading rates nlrs which greatly impact the reactor performances therefore it is necessary to maintain the same nlrs when exploring the impacts of hydrodynamic wash on the performance of anammox based processes more importantly although numerous attempts have been conducted to explore the effects of operating conditions on anammox processes and community structure the detailed clues at bacterial interactions were not well revealed for instance shu et al 21 demonstrated that abundant and rare sub communities present divergent co occurrence patterns in anammox reactor moreover by employing metabolic network analysis lawson et al 22 found considerable interactions between anammox and heterotrophic bacteria such studies in fact can largely improve our understanding on the microbial processes of anammox reactors however more information about bacterial interaction of anammox processes is yet to be fully understood the purpose of this study was therefore to assess the long term effects of hydrodynamic wash on the bacterial activity community structure and species species interactions of an anammox based process based on the operation of three identical well controlled reactors the nitrogen concentrations were regularly monitored extracellular polymeric substances eps heme c and specific anammox activity saa were also measured during the entire operation moreover the microbial community structures in three reactors were analyzed by high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene based on these results the response of the anammox bacteria community to different hydrodynamic conditions was statistically analyzed 2 methods and materials 2 1 long term operation of the anammox reactors three lab scale hybrid reactors biofilm and granular system with a working volume of 1 l height 20 cm diameter 8 cm were operated in parallel for the treatment of synthetic nitrogen containing wastewater the non woven fabrics 1 1 cm were used as bio carriers in the reactors with a filling ratio of about 31 microbial inoculum 500 ml with an initial vss of 6800 mg l in each reactor was taken from a non woven biofilm reactor in our lab which had a nitrogen removal rates nrrs of approximately 1 6 g n l d sequencing analysis showed that the inoculated biomass was dominated by the genus ca jettenia with a relative abundance of up to 17 98 followed by ca kuenenia 1 15 and ca brocadia 1 11 reactor w reactor m and reactor s represents the reactors operated under weak moderate and strong hydrodynamic wash with hydraulic retention times hrts of 4 2 and 1 h respectively table s1 the three reactors reactor w reactor m and reactor s were continuously fed from the bottom of the reactors with an inorganic nitrogen medium containing nh4 n 100 50 and 25 mg n l 1 and no2 n 120 60 and 30 mg n l 1 at three different total nitrogen tn concentrations of 220 110 and 55 mg n l 1 respectively which yielded the same nlr of 1 32 g n l d for all three reactors in addition the feeding wastewater was dosed with nahco3 kh2po4 and a trace element solution to maintain a stable ph of about 7 5 and to provide nutrients for bacterial growth details of the wastewater compositions can be found in table s2 to eliminate the impact of dissolved oxygen do in wastewater on anammox process the influent wastewater was sparged with nitrogen gas before feeding into the reactors the temperature in the reactor bulk was kept at 33 1 c throughout the operation period no sludge was deliberately removed from the reactors except for biomass sampling for the analysis of specific anammox activity saa heme c eps and the microbial community 2 2 measurement of saa a series of batch tests were conducted to measure the anammox activity during long term reactor operation a certain amount of biomass was sampled from the reactor and then washed with phosphate buffer solution pbs 10 mm ph 7 5 three times to remove residue nitrogen species the washed biomass was then transferred to serum bottles with an effective volume of 100 ml the biomass concentrations were controlled at approximately 1000 mg l nh4 2so4 50 mg n l 1 and nano2 60 mg n l 1 were added into the serum bottles to yield a final total nitrogen of 110 mg l the bottles were aerated with 95 ar 5 co2 gas to remove do in the mixed liquor the ph of the mixed liquor was also controlled at 7 5 by adding nahco3 the bottles were then hermetically sealed and placed in a thermostatic shaker at 33 1 c and 150 rpm the nh4 n and no2 n concentrations were analyzed at regular intervals and the saa was calculated using the equation saa sc vss where sc represents the maximum substrate consumption rate and is expressed as mg n g vss d 2 3 determination of heme c the anammox biomass sampled from reactors was washed with pbs buffer 10 mm ph 7 5 and then centrifuged 3000 g 4 c 5 min then the anammox pellets 1 g were re suspended using 25 ml of pbs buffer followed by sonication ultrasonic processor cpx 750 usa 800 w 4 c 30 min the sonicated biomass was centrifuged 15 000 g 4 c 15 min to separate the cell masses the supernatant was used for c type heme quantification the heme c content was quantified using the methods depicted by berry and trumpower 23 and is expressed as μmol g vss 1 the levels of heme c μmol g vss 1 in triplicate samples were analyzed and averaged 2 4 extraction and quantification of eps eps was extracted from anammox samples using the heat extraction method 24 the pellets of centrifuged anammox biomass 3500 g 4 c 10 min were washed with nacl solution 0 1 m and then re suspended with nacl solution 0 1 m the re suspended solutions were heated in a water bath for 30 min at 60 c subsequently the treated solutions were centrifuged 12 000 g 4 c 15 min to obtain eps the eps in supernatants was collected with 0 20 μm membranes polysaccharides and proteins in the eps were quantified according to the methods of dubois 25 and lowry 26 using glucose and bovine serum albumin as the standards respectively 2 5 dna extraction pcr amplification and data processing biomass samples from the three reactors were collected on days 10 70 130 and 200 triplicate samples were collected from one reactor at each sampling time point each sample was a mixture of biomass biofilm and granules collected from different parts bottom middle and top of a given reactor the collected samples were immediately fixed by mixing them with 100 ethanol at a 1 1 vol ratio and then stored at 20 c for subsequent dna extraction the genomic dna was extracted using powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca as described in the manufacturer s instructions dna quality was determined using a nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies inc wilmington de the v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using the primers 515 f and 806r 27 the 5 terminus of the forward primer contained a 12 bp barcode for multiplex sequencing three pcr amplifications were carried out for each sample using 50 μl reaction mixtures the triplicate amplicons were pooled and purified using a qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen chatsworth ca usa sequencing libraries were generated using nebnext ultra dna library prep kit for illumina new england biolabs usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the libraries were sequenced using the illumina hiseq 2500 platform and 250 bp paired end reads were generated at magigene guangzhou china the paired end raw reads were first filtered using trimmomatic the obtained clean reads were then merged using flash followed by quality control using mothur 28 sequences were denoised using the pre cluster in mothur platform 29 the chimera sequences were detected and removed using the uchime 30 the resulting sequences 45 391 85 578 per sample were randomly extracted from each sample to the minimum sequencing depth of 45 391 for normalization then the sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at the 97 sequence similarity level 31 the most abundant sequence in each otu was chosen as the representative sequence of that otu and these representative sequences were taxonomically assigned using the ribosomal database project rdp classifier at the 80 threshold 32 2 6 network construction to elucidate the bacterial interactions in the three anammox reactors in response to hydraulic condition we constructed and analyzed three groups of phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens using the online mena pipeline http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena which employs random matrix theory rmt for threshold identification 33 firstly a pearson correlation matrix was obtained by determining pairwise pearson correlations based on the standardized relative abundance dataset and then the correlation matrix was converted into a similarity matrix secondly an appropriate threshold value st for defining the structure of the network was identified using rmt based network analysis approach subsequently an adjacency matrix encoded the connection strength between each pair of nodes was obtained by retaining all the otus whose abundance similarity values were greater than the determined threshold in addition the matrices were permutated 100 times to generate random networks and statistical z test was then conducted to evaluate the differences between the indexes of experimental network and random networks the network graphs were visualized using gephi 0 9 2 software various network topological indexes including number of nodes number of edges average degree avg k average cluster coefficient avg cc centralization

network can be inferred based on two parameters 1 within module connectivity zi and 2 connectivity among modules pi accordingly all the nodes taxa were assigned to the following four roles according to olesen et al 34 peripherals zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 connectors zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 module hubs zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 and network hubs zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 2 7 physicochemical analysis the ph and do were monitored using a ph meter inolab 7310 wtw germany and a do meter cellox 3310i wtw germany respectively according to standard methods 35 ammonium and nitrite were determined using the phenate method and colorimetric method respectively while nitrate and total nitrogen were measured spectrophotometrically volatile suspended solids vss was determined by weighing method 2 8 statistical analysis statistical differences in the water quality and the sludge properties between the three reactors were analyzed by two tailed independent sample t test spss16 0 chicago il usa if the resulting p value was lower than 0 05 the differences were considered statistically significant the microbial diversity indexes including chao 1 observed species simpson and shannon were calculated using qiime v1 9 1

startup period of 80 days the three reactors achieved stable nitrogen removal performance as shown in figure s1 the average tn concentrations in the effluent of reactor w reactor m and reactor s were determined to be 25 96 8 50 15 00 4 03 and 10 04 2 95 mg l see table 1 respectively overall during the experimental period the average tn removal efficiencies of reactor w reactor m and reactor s were 88 32 3 70 86 26 4 21 and 82 32 5 25 respectively corresponding to the average nitrogen removal rates nrrs of 1 18 0 07 1 15 0 15 and 1 13 0 13 g n l d p 0 05 these results imply that the three reactors possessed comparable nitrogen removal capabilities throughout the whole operating period at an identical nlr of 1 32 g n l d in terms of the process stoichiometry the nitrite to ammonium conversion ratios rnitrite ammonium were 1 26 0 13 1 26 0 24 and 1 28 0 21 for reactor w reactor m and reactor s respectively table 1 comparable to previously reported stoichiometric ratios for anammox process 36 37 in regard to the nitrate production to ammonium conversion ratios rnitrate ammonium the values increased from 0 15 to 0 22 as the hydrodynamic conditions become stronger with the hrt decreasing from 4 h to 1 h these results are consistent with ma et al who reported that rnitrate ammonium showed an increasing tendency as the hrt decreased from 3 h to 1 5 h 38 the rnitrate ammonium lower than theoretical values of 0 26 is suggestive of the occurrence of denitrification in the reactors 39 thus our results that the rnitrate ammonium in the order of reactor w reactor m reactor s likely imply the higher denitrification potentials in reactor w than in reactor m and reactor s 3 2 characteristics of anammox biomass during the entire operation period denser anammox biofilm was observed in reactor s hrt 1 h than in reactor m hrt 2 h and reactor w hrt 4 h figure s2 moreover red anammox granules were formed at the bottom of the reactors as a result of the detachment of biomass from carriers interestingly the granules in reactor w were much smaller than those in reactor m and reactor s in addition we found that the eps amounts decreased with the enhancing hydrodynamic conditions despite the fact that comparable nitrogen removal capabilities were achieved in the three reactors specifically the total amounts of eps in reactor w reactor m and reactor s were determined to be 56 11 4 94 33 68 5 21 and 24 12 3 82 mg g vss respectively figure s3 moreover the proteins increased rapidly as compared to polysaccharides leading to a higher protein to polysaccharides ratio pn ps in reactor w the heme c is an important component of the anammox cell and can reflect the activity of anammox bacteria 40 as shown in fig 1 a significantly p 0 05 higher heme c contents were observed in reactor s and reactor m than in reactor w given 1 58 0 33 1 45 0 32 and 0 99 0 18 μmol g vss on average for reactor s reactor m and reactor w respectively the saa was determined to further clarify the response of anammox activity to different hydrodynamic conditions in line with heme c contents the saa increased from 64 69 1 00 119 12 9 64 mg n g vss d as the hydrodynamic conditions became stronger fig 1b further corroborating a higher anammox activity at stronger hydrodynamic conditions these results were supported by a previous study in which the saa increased with increasing upflow velocity under a constant nlr of 5 6 kg n m3 d in an upflow anammox based process 38 also of note is that the above results provide a reasonable explanation for the lower biomass concentrations but comparable nitrogen removal performance of reactor s as compared with reactor m and reactor w i e biomass concentrations were determined to be 7203 8488 and 8652 mg vss l in reactor s reactor m and reactor w at the end of experiment respectively 3 3 microbial community evolution and composition segregation at different hydrodynamic conditions biomass samples were harvested from reactor w reactor m and reactor s on days 10 70 130 and 200 for microbial community analysis alpha diversity indexes were used to compare the biodiversity in different reactors as shown in fig 2 microbial diversity showed significant differences among reactors the microbial richness as measured by chao 1 and observed species indexes was found to be highest in reactor s followed by reactor m and reactor w in that order in line with the patterns of richness indexes higher evenness indexes including shannon and simpson were observed in reactor s and reactor m than in reactor w these results suggest that a stronger hydrodynamic condition resulted in a higher microbial diversity in addition the nmds ordination was used to investigate the dissimilarity of microbial community compositions among reactor w reactor m and reactor s as visualized in fig 3 the microbial communities of the 36 samples from the three reactors could be clearly clustered into three different groups suggesting the presence of distinct community compositions in the three reactors the differences were further confirmed as statistically significant by multi response permutation procedures mrpp p 0 001 a 0 2654 taxonomic analysis revealed that the most abundant representatives were planctomycetes proteobacteria chlorobi and chloroflexi phyla in all samples fig 4 specifically the sequences related to anammox like planctomycetes made up on average 36 48 32 15 and 42 71 of the total 16s rrna gene derived from the samples collected from reactor w reactor m and reactor s respectively the abundance of planctomycetes increased progressively with the operational time regardless of the hydrodynamic conditions the average relative abundances of other dominant phyla in reactor w reactor m and reactor s were respectively 19 19 16 04 and 15 25 for proteobacteria 16 48 19 75 and 12 82 for chlorobi and 18 17 14 93 and 11 25 for chloroflexi these four dominant phyla constituted 82 03 90 32 of the total community in the present study signifying their important roles in anammox cultures other minor phyla average relative abundance 10 included oc31 armatimonadetes acidobacteria armatimonadetes and od1 note that the relative abundance of phylum oc31 was significantly p 0 001 higher in reactor s 6 32 and reactor m 7 35 than that in reactor w 0 09 while the abundance of phylum od1 was significantly p 0 001 higher in reactor w 2 78 than that in reactor m 0 49 and reactor s 0 79 fig 4 additionally heterotrophic rhodocyclaceae and comamonadaceae members of which are capable of heterotrophic denitrification 41 were also detected in three reactors rhodocyclaceae and comamonadaceae were both much more abundant in reactor w 12 07 and 0 49 and reactor m 8 90 and 0 61 than in reactor s 6 77 and 0 92 figure s4a this result indicates the high degree of denitrification process in reactor w as compared with that in reactor m and reactor s and consequently resulted in the lower nitrate production in reactor w than in reactor m and reactor s as mentioned above table 1 3 4 dynamics of the anammox populations the genera ca brocadia ca kuenenia and ca jettenia were detected in all samples in the present study notably genus ca kuenenia only accounted for a very small proportion of the microbial community throughout the operation period regardless of hydrodynamic conditions with the average relative abundances of 0 01 0 01 and 0 02 for reactor w reactor m and reactor s respectively fig 5 and table s3 the relative abundance of genus ca jettenia decreased with the increasing hydrodynamic wash given the average relative abundance of 27 54 22 71 and 12 46 for reactor w reactor m and reactor s respectively fig 5 and table s3 the opposite trend for relative abundance of ca brocadia was observed i e the genus ca brocadia was found to be most abundant in reactor s 19 89 followed by reactor m 2 50 and reactor w 0 53 moreover it was found that the relative abundance of ca jettenia remained relatively stable in reactor m and reactor s but increased gradually in reactor w with extended operation in comparison the relative abundance of ca brocadia which remained relatively stable in reactor w increased continuously in reactor m and reactor s throughout the operation period fig 5 more importantly in contrast to ca jettenia being the predominant anammox genus in reactor w and reactor m consistently throughout the operation period a population shift from ca jettenia to ca brocadia occurred in reactor s specifically after 70 days operation at a strong hydrodynamic wash with the increasing population from 5 20 on day 10 to 14 17 on day 70 ca brocadia outcompeted ca jettenia and became the dominant genus in reactor s 3 5 bacterial associations of the three anammox communities to discern the bacterial interactions of the anammox microbial communities rmt based networks were constructed based on correlation relationships fig 6 the global network topology followed a scale free degree distribution with r2 being 0 79 0 80 and 0 78 for reactor w reactor m and reactor s microbial community respectively meaning that most nodes otus in networks had few links while only a few hub nodes had numerous links moreover similar to those in other ecosystems 42 43 the modularity average path lengths avg gd and average clustering coefficient avg cc of the empirical networks were greater than their corresponding random networks table 2 indicating the small world and modular characteristics of network 44 the resulting bacterial networks consisted of 76 nodes linked by 173 edges 41 04 positive and 58 96 negative 106 nodes linked by 166 edges 43 98 positive and 56 02 negative and 106 nodes linked by 324 edges 50 31 positive and 49 69 negative for reactor w reactor m and reactor s microbial community respectively table 2 table s4 s5 and s6 in addition it is striking that all interactions without exception in networks with different hydrodynamic wash between nodes belonging to planctomycetes and nodes belonging to chloroflexi were negative table s4 s5 and s6 this suggested that there are strong negative correlations between planctomycetes and chloroflexi moreover we found that most of the taxa that positively correlated with anammox related bacteria were affiliated with phylum planctomycetes and proteobacteria which might benefited the anammox community or assisted with anammox community shift based on the above constructed networks we examined whether otus in anammox communities with different hydrodynamic wash exhibited unique topological features and compared the network topological features of the three anammox communities as shown in table 2 the modularity was highest in reactor m community followed by reactor w and reactor s community the betweenness centrality bc is indicative of the relative importance of control potential that an otu exerts on the interactions of other otus in its own network 45 in this study significantly higher bc value were observed for otus in reactor m community than those in reactor w p 0 01 and reactor s community p 0 001 figure s5a the average degree avg k and clustering coefficient avg cc followed an opposite trend with significant differences p 0 01 were observed across the three networks figure s5b and c moreover the smaller average geodesic distance gd value in reactor s suggested stronger interactions between species the analysis of modular topological features is important to identify key populations based on the nodes topological roles in their own network the topological roles of nodes can be defined by two parameters within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi according to the threshold values of zi and pi 34 the roles of nodes were classified into four categories peripherals connectors module hubs and network hubs the topological roles of nodes in the three networks were illustrated in z p plot fig 7 majority of the nodes in three networks 84 21 for reactor w 98 11 for reactor m and 96 23 for reactor s were categorized as peripherals specialists that have only a few links and most of their links were inside their own modules apparent differences in the specialists composition were found among the three reactors for instance 4 5 and 9 specialists nodes belonging to anammox otus were found in reactor w reactor m and reactor s respectively among the found anammox related specialists 1 out of 5 2 out of 5 and 4 out of 9 specialists fall within genus ca brocadia in reactor w reactor m and reactor s respectively moreover a total of 18 nodes 12 for reactor w 2 for reactor m and 4 for reactor s were categorized as connectors or module hubs generalists that are highly connected to several modules or highly connected to many nodes in their own modules note that no node was categorized as network hub supergeneralists in the three networks it has been suggested that the microorganisms acting as generalists roles are of high importance to maintain the stability and functions of ecosystems 46 it is interesting to note that the nodes identified as generalists in the three networks were different from each other fig 7 indicating that different keystone species maintained the stability and functions of reactors operated under different hydrodynamic wash conditions moreover for the shared otus a total of 38 otus were shared by the three networks no significant p 0 05 relationships were found for the zi value among the three networks taken together these results suggested that hydrodynamic wash greatly altered the network structure and the topological roles of individual otu and key microbial populations 4 discussion 4 1 influence of hydrodynamic conditions on anammox process in this study different hydrodynamic conditions resulted in distinct anammox biomass characteristics i e larger anammox granules in reactor s were observed than those in reactor m and reactor w this was likely due to the stronger hydrodynamic shear force induced by the higher liquid upflow velocity in reactor s two and four times higher than that in reactor m and reactor w respectively which can aid in the formation of bigger granules in upflow anammox reactors 13 14 moreover our results showed that the eps contents decreased with the increasing degree of hydrodynamic wash the fact that different hydrodynamic wash and or upflow velocities in this study resulted in different washout rates of dissolved organic carbon derived from anammox reaction 47 therefore it could be expected that the eps content was lowest in reactor s followed by reactor m and reactor w in that order on the other hand distinct microbial compositions which were responsible for eps production and degradation 48 likely contributed to the different eps contents in the three reactors it was suggested that the eps can be an important carbon source for denitrification in anammox based processes 49 thus the higher eps contents likely led to higher degree of denitrification in reactor w and reactor m compared with that in reactor s which was in agreement with the result of process stoichiometry i e lower rnitrate ammonium in reactor w and reactor m than in reactor s more importantly it has been demonstrated that the presence of organic matter would negatively influence the anammox activity 50 51 thus the higher eps contents likely cause a higher degree of inhibition of anammox bacterial activity in reactor w as compared with those in reactor m and reactor s additionally the increasing liquid upflow velocity could enhanced the external mass transfer which is beneficial for the bacterial activity 52 similarly guo et al 18 recently reported that the anammox metabolic activity characterized by heme c content and transcription level of hzsa gene was gradually increased with decreasing hrt from 36 h to 1 h additionally it is known that as the srt increases the fraction of active biomass decreases 53 thus a longer srt as a result of less biomass washout at lower upflow velocity would lead to a higher fraction of dormancy or inactive cells and consequently resulted in lower anammox bacterial activity in reactor w 4 2 influence of hydrodynamic wash on microbial community of anammox process nmds analysis showed significant p 0 001 differences in the community structure among reactors operated under different hydrodynamic wash suggesting that the hydrodynamic wash exerted a substantial influence on the anammox community composition indeed the hydrodynamic wash influence srt significantly 54 55 in this study stronger hydrodynamic stresses or washout in reactor s resulted in shorter srts as compared with those in reactor m and reactor w more severe biomass washout in reactor s averaged at 0 55 mg l as compared with those in reactor m 0 22 mg l and reactor w 0 08 mg l were observed during a 20 days observations from day 180 to day 200 besides it has been demonstrated that genus ca brocadia has a higher growth rate than ca jettenia 4 therefore genus ca brocadia could out compete ca jettenia in reactor s after long term operation under strong hydrodynamic wash the coexistence of microorganisms belonging to heterotrophic chloroflexi has commonly found in anammox reactors fed with cod free synthetic wastewater 56 57 previous study has indicated that heterotrophic chloroflexi preferentially utilized cellular compounds released from the dead biomass and metabolites of autotrophic bacteria 58 59 in this study the higher abundance of chloroflexi in reactor w operated under weak hydrodynamic wash may be related to a longer srt which resulted in a higher degree of biomass decay moreover the lower washout rate also led to a higher degree of accumulation of metabolic wastes in reactor w which promoted the growth of chloroflexi additionally on the basis of the commensalistic relationship between chloroflexi and planctomycetes chloroflexi cross feed on compounds that are produced by planctomycetes the shift in the abundance of chloroflexi was expected to be positively correlated with that of planctomycetes however actual results in this study suggest otherwise without exception the abundance of planctomycetes increased continuously with extended operation in the three reactors while chloroflexi showed the opposite trend this result was supported by network analysis which showed that all interactions between nodes belonging to planctomycetes and nodes belonging to chloroflexi were negative connan et al 60 also observed a similar result with the shift in the abundance of chloroflexi being independent of the shift in the abundance of planctomycetes in their time series data set these findings therefore highlight the need to evaluate accurately the ecophysiological role s of coexisting chloroflexi in anammox cultures additionally our results showed that hydrodynamic wash greatly altered the network structure and the ecological roles of individual otu and key microbial populations specifically clear differences in the specialists composition especially anammox related specialists were found among the three reactors suggesting that the hydrodynamic wash play a key role in impacting the topological roles of anammox related otus importantly we found that among the 18 generalists detected in three networks only one anammox related otu was assigned suggesting that keystone otus are not always necessary to be anammox bacteria in anammox enriched culture moreover the lower modularity which reflect habitat heterogeneity in network of reactor s indicated a lower degree of niche differentiation in reactor s 61 it has been demonstrated that significant niche differentiation could inhibit the bacterial interactions between species 62 therefore the lower degree of niche differentiation likely resulted in stronger interactions between species in reactor s as indicated by smaller gd value moreover it has been demonstrated that the nutrient input can largely stimulate the bacterial interactions 42 44 thus another potential explanation for the stronger interactions between species in reactor s is the enhanced external mass transfer induced by stronger hydrodynamic stresses or washout nonetheless it should be noted that use of correlation based approaches for inferring biotic interactions may produce unreliable results since the obtained data take the form of relative abundances of taxa rather than their absolute abundances 63 moreover environmental heterogeneity complex nonlinear dynamics indirect associations and compositionality of sequencing data all hinder the usefulness of the correlation metrics when inferring direct species species associations 64 thus infallible methodologies should be developed to address these challenges in the future 4 3 implications and research needs hydrodynamic conditions have significant influence on biomass characteristic mass transfer exopolysaccharide production and metabolic genetic behaviors of anammox microbial consortia 2 13 14 in this study we found that operating an anammox reactor under stronger hydrodynamic wash i e shorter hrt can actually improve the activity of anammox bacteria this provides a useful avenue for robust operation of anammox processes on one hand a shorter hrt can result in a higher nlr on the other hand a shorter hrt represents a less reactor volume i e a smaller footprint meanwhile a shorter hrt has a positive impact on the production of anammox bacterial communication signals 65 and enhances the external mass transfer 52 66 which are beneficial for the nitrogen removal performance 67 additionally on the basis of our findings a promising strategy for accelerating the start up of mainstream anammox reactor could be expected that is when seeding sidestream anammox sludge by shortening the hrt to maintain a constant nlr as the inocula mainstream anammox process could be rapidly started up in such a scenario the anammox bacterial activity in mainstream anammox reactor can be largely improved which require much less seeding sludge moreover a population shift from ca jettenia to ca brocadia was observed in reactor s which was likely attributed to the decreased srt and different growth rates of ca jettenia and ca brocadia nonetheless there may be other factors affecting the competition among anammox bacteria such as cell tolerance to various compounds accumulation of metabolites and interactions between anammox species and other bacteria in this study for instance sulfur oxidizing bacteria were highly abundant in the three reactors figure s4b their presences can affect the ecological niche of anammox bacteria by altering anammox activities 68 or directly altering the competition among anammox species 69 moreover the production of eps and heme can also be affected by the dominant anammox species for instance in the current study it was found that as hrt decreased eps content increased while heme content decreased nonetheless due to the limited information on the niche differentiation of anammox species and other community members it is difficult to infer conclusively their competition or their roles in eps and heme production 70 these issues await future investigations in summary we found that heme c content and saas gradually increased as the hrt decrease indicating that shortening hrt could largely improve the activity of anammox bacteria the results of 16s rrna gene sequencing revealed that significant p 0 001 differences in microbial compositions were found among the reactors operated under different hrt moreover it was strikingly to found that anammox like bacteria in the reactors operated at hrt of 2 and 4h were consistently dominated by ca jettenia whereas a population shift from ca jettenia to ca brocadia was observed in the reactor operated at hrt of 1 h additionally network analysis showed that hrt greatly altered the bacterial interactions of anammox process and the ecological roles of individual otu and key microbial populations overall this study provided new insights into bacterial activities microbial structures and associations of anammox processes responding to varying hrt declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

14204,the responses of microbial community structures and bacterial interactions of anammox process to hydrodynamic wash was investigated based on the operation of three identical anammox reactors with the same nitrogen loading rate we found that though the three reactors achieved comparable nitrogen removal performance during the whole operation period the average specific anammox activities saas increased with decreasing hydraulic retention time hrt resulting in saas of 64 69 73 99 and 119 12 mg n g vss d at hrt of 4 2 and 1 h respectively the bacterial diversity was observed to increase with decreasing hrt moreover significant p 0 001 differences in microbial compositions were found among the three reactors demonstrating that the hydrodynamic wash played an important role in determining the microbial community structure of anammox process taxonomic analysis revealed that the anammox like bacteria in the reactors subjected to weaker hydrodynamic wash were consistently dominated by ca jettenia whereas a population shift from ca jettenia to ca brocadia was observed in the reactor with a strong hydrodynamic wash additionally network analysis showed that hydrodynamic wash greatly altered the species species interactions and the ecological roles of individual otus and key microbial populations overall the results obtained in this study highlight the importance of hydrodynamic wash in determining the bacterial activity community structure and species interactions of anammox process keywords anammox hydrodynamic wash microbial community bacterial interactions 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox has been documented as a very promising option for nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment 1 3 it offers several advantages over the conventional nitrification denitrification technologies such as higher nitrogen removal rate lower operational cost and smaller footprint 4 over the past decade anammox based processes have been extensively implemented in the treatment of ammonium rich wastewaters such as industrial wastewater and the sidestream of municipal wastewater treatment plants 5 in recent years the application of anammox based processes has been extended to mainstream wastewater treatment plants 6 9 to aid in achieving an energy neutral operation though anammox is a promising nitrogen removal process anammox bacteria show a high sensitivity to the changing environmental conditions such as temperature salinity substrate concentration organic matters 5 10 etc crucially these environmental variables could interact with each other in a number of ways 11 leading to fluctuation of nitrogen removal performance during long term operation apart from the environmental variables manipulable operational parameters can also play significant roles in affecting the anammox based processes in practice due to the long doubling time of anammox bacteria the anammox reactors are operated at relatively long solids retention time srt in order to increase the biomass concentration in the system an efficient alternative strategy to improve anammox biomass retention is the use of biofilm and granular systems 12 in biofilm and granular systems the formation of compact aggregates increases the settling velocity of the anammox biomass and improves the biomass retention hydrodynamic conditions play significant roles in affecting the biofilm formation and sludge granulation indeed more compact and dense biofilm and granular can be formed under relatively high hydrodynamic stress 2 furthermore hydrodynamic wash has significant influence on biomass characteristic mass transfer activity and metabolic behaviors of anammox consortia 2 13 15 therefore from an engineering point of view hydrodynamic condition can be manipulated as an efficient operational parameter to enhance the reactor performance previous studies suggested that the variation in hrt can result in differences in srt biomass decay yield and the accumulation of metabolic products and consequently influence the activity of anammox bacteria and reactor performance 2 15 16 for instance zhang et al 17 demonstrated that an extended hrt resulted in accumulated soluble microbial products which weakened the activity and tolerance ability of anammox bacteria more recently by using lc ms based metabolomic analysis guo et al 18 reported that the anammox metabolic activity gradually increased with decreasing hrt from 36 h to 1 h however guo et al 19 reported that the activity of anammox bacteria was sensitive to the hydraulic shocks with the specific anammox activity saa decreased significantly as the hrt decreased in comparison chen et al 20 reported that the performance of the anammox reactor was not significantly affected by transient hydraulic shock overall the reported results differed or were even contradictory because of different operational conditions particularly for the nitrogen loading rates nlrs which greatly impact the reactor performances therefore it is necessary to maintain the same nlrs when exploring the impacts of hydrodynamic wash on the performance of anammox based processes more importantly although numerous attempts have been conducted to explore the effects of operating conditions on anammox processes and community structure the detailed clues at bacterial interactions were not well revealed for instance shu et al 21 demonstrated that abundant and rare sub communities present divergent co occurrence patterns in anammox reactor moreover by employing metabolic network analysis lawson et al 22 found considerable interactions between anammox and heterotrophic bacteria such studies in fact can largely improve our understanding on the microbial processes of anammox reactors however more information about bacterial interaction of anammox processes is yet to be fully understood the purpose of this study was therefore to assess the long term effects of hydrodynamic wash on the bacterial activity community structure and species species interactions of an anammox based process based on the operation of three identical well controlled reactors the nitrogen concentrations were regularly monitored extracellular polymeric substances eps heme c and specific anammox activity saa were also measured during the entire operation moreover the microbial community structures in three reactors were analyzed by high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene based on these results the response of the anammox bacteria community to different hydrodynamic conditions was statistically analyzed 2 methods and materials 2 1 long term operation of the anammox reactors three lab scale hybrid reactors biofilm and granular system with a working volume of 1 l height 20 cm diameter 8 cm were operated in parallel for the treatment of synthetic nitrogen containing wastewater the non woven fabrics 1 1 cm were used as bio carriers in the reactors with a filling ratio of about 31 microbial inoculum 500 ml with an initial vss of 6800 mg l in each reactor was taken from a non woven biofilm reactor in our lab which had a nitrogen removal rates nrrs of approximately 1 6 g n l d sequencing analysis showed that the inoculated biomass was dominated by the genus ca jettenia with a relative abundance of up to 17 98 followed by ca kuenenia 1 15 and ca brocadia 1 11 reactor w reactor m and reactor s represents the reactors operated under weak moderate and strong hydrodynamic wash with hydraulic retention times hrts of 4 2 and 1 h respectively table s1 the three reactors reactor w reactor m and reactor s were continuously fed from the bottom of the reactors with an inorganic nitrogen medium containing nh4 n 100 50 and 25 mg n l 1 and no2 n 120 60 and 30 mg n l 1 at three different total nitrogen tn concentrations of 220 110 and 55 mg n l 1 respectively which yielded the same nlr of 1 32 g n l d for all three reactors in addition the feeding wastewater was dosed with nahco3 kh2po4 and a trace element solution to maintain a stable ph of about 7 5 and to provide nutrients for bacterial growth details of the wastewater compositions can be found in table s2 to eliminate the impact of dissolved oxygen do in wastewater on anammox process the influent wastewater was sparged with nitrogen gas before feeding into the reactors the temperature in the reactor bulk was kept at 33 1 c throughout the operation period no sludge was deliberately removed from the reactors except for biomass sampling for the analysis of specific anammox activity saa heme c eps and the microbial community 2 2 measurement of saa a series of batch tests were conducted to measure the anammox activity during long term reactor operation a certain amount of biomass was sampled from the reactor and then washed with phosphate buffer solution pbs 10 mm ph 7 5 three times to remove residue nitrogen species the washed biomass was then transferred to serum bottles with an effective volume of 100 ml the biomass concentrations were controlled at approximately 1000 mg l nh4 2so4 50 mg n l 1 and nano2 60 mg n l 1 were added into the serum bottles to yield a final total nitrogen of 110 mg l the bottles were aerated with 95 ar 5 co2 gas to remove do in the mixed liquor the ph of the mixed liquor was also controlled at 7 5 by adding nahco3 the bottles were then hermetically sealed and placed in a thermostatic shaker at 33 1 c and 150 rpm the nh4 n and no2 n concentrations were analyzed at regular intervals and the saa was calculated using the equation saa sc vss where sc represents the maximum substrate consumption rate and is expressed as mg n g vss d 2 3 determination of heme c the anammox biomass sampled from reactors was washed with pbs buffer 10 mm ph 7 5 and then centrifuged 3000 g 4 c 5 min then the anammox pellets 1 g were re suspended using 25 ml of pbs buffer followed by sonication ultrasonic processor cpx 750 usa 800 w 4 c 30 min the sonicated biomass was centrifuged 15 000 g 4 c 15 min to separate the cell masses the supernatant was used for c type heme quantification the heme c content was quantified using the methods depicted by berry and trumpower 23 and is expressed as μmol g vss 1 the levels of heme c μmol g vss 1 in triplicate samples were analyzed and averaged 2 4 extraction and quantification of eps eps was extracted from anammox samples using the heat extraction method 24 the pellets of centrifuged anammox biomass 3500 g 4 c 10 min were washed with nacl solution 0 1 m and then re suspended with nacl solution 0 1 m the re suspended solutions were heated in a water bath for 30 min at 60 c subsequently the treated solutions were centrifuged 12 000 g 4 c 15 min to obtain eps the eps in supernatants was collected with 0 20 μm membranes polysaccharides and proteins in the eps were quantified according to the methods of dubois 25 and lowry 26 using glucose and bovine serum albumin as the standards respectively 2 5 dna extraction pcr amplification and data processing biomass samples from the three reactors were collected on days 10 70 130 and 200 triplicate samples were collected from one reactor at each sampling time point each sample was a mixture of biomass biofilm and granules collected from different parts bottom middle and top of a given reactor the collected samples were immediately fixed by mixing them with 100 ethanol at a 1 1 vol ratio and then stored at 20 c for subsequent dna extraction the genomic dna was extracted using powersoil dna isolation kit mobio laboratories carlsbad ca as described in the manufacturer s instructions dna quality was determined using a nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies inc wilmington de the v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified using the primers 515 f and 806r 27 the 5 terminus of the forward primer contained a 12 bp barcode for multiplex sequencing three pcr amplifications were carried out for each sample using 50 μl reaction mixtures the triplicate amplicons were pooled and purified using a qiaquick gel extraction kit qiagen chatsworth ca usa sequencing libraries were generated using nebnext ultra dna library prep kit for illumina new england biolabs usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the libraries were sequenced using the illumina hiseq 2500 platform and 250 bp paired end reads were generated at magigene guangzhou china the paired end raw reads were first filtered using trimmomatic the obtained clean reads were then merged using flash followed by quality control using mothur 28 sequences were denoised using the pre cluster in mothur platform 29 the chimera sequences were detected and removed using the uchime 30 the resulting sequences 45 391 85 578 per sample were randomly extracted from each sample to the minimum sequencing depth of 45 391 for normalization then the sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at the 97 sequence similarity level 31 the most abundant sequence in each otu was chosen as the representative sequence of that otu and these representative sequences were taxonomically assigned using the ribosomal database project rdp classifier at the 80 threshold 32 2 6 network construction to elucidate the bacterial interactions in the three anammox reactors in response to hydraulic condition we constructed and analyzed three groups of phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens using the online mena pipeline http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena which employs random matrix theory rmt for threshold identification 33 firstly a pearson correlation matrix was obtained by determining pairwise pearson correlations based on the standardized relative abundance dataset and then the correlation matrix was converted into a similarity matrix secondly an appropriate threshold value st for defining the structure of the network was identified using rmt based network analysis approach subsequently an adjacency matrix encoded the connection strength between each pair of nodes was obtained by retaining all the otus whose abundance similarity values were greater than the determined threshold in addition the matrices were permutated 100 times to generate random networks and statistical z test was then conducted to evaluate the differences between the indexes of experimental network and random networks the network graphs were visualized using gephi 0 9 2 software various network topological indexes including number of nodes number of edges average degree avg k average cluster coefficient avg cc centralization of betweenness cb and modularity were determined based on the adjacency matrix detailed definitions of the network topological indexes are shown in table s2 the topological roles of nodes otus in the network can be inferred based on two parameters 1 within module connectivity zi and 2 connectivity among modules pi accordingly all the nodes taxa were assigned to the following four roles according to olesen et al 34 peripherals zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 connectors zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 module hubs zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 and network hubs zi 2 5 and pi 0 62 2 7 physicochemical analysis the ph and do were monitored using a ph meter inolab 7310 wtw germany and a do meter cellox 3310i wtw germany respectively according to standard methods 35 ammonium and nitrite were determined using the phenate method and colorimetric method respectively while nitrate and total nitrogen were measured spectrophotometrically volatile suspended solids vss was determined by weighing method 2 8 statistical analysis statistical differences in the water quality and the sludge properties between the three reactors were analyzed by two tailed independent sample t test spss16 0 chicago il usa if the resulting p value was lower than 0 05 the differences were considered statistically significant the microbial diversity indexes including chao 1 observed species simpson and shannon were calculated using qiime v1 9 1 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds of unweighted unifrac distance matrices was used to estimate the differences in microbial community structure between samples multi response permutation procedure mrpp 999 permutations was used to verify the statistical significance of microbial community difference between reactor w reactor m and reactor s 3 results 3 1 nitrogen removal after a startup period of 80 days the three reactors achieved stable nitrogen removal performance as shown in figure s1 the average tn concentrations in the effluent of reactor w reactor m and reactor s were determined to be 25 96 8 50 15 00 4 03 and 10 04 2 95 mg l see table 1 respectively overall during the experimental period the average tn removal efficiencies of reactor w reactor m and reactor s were 88 32 3 70 86 26 4 21 and 82 32 5 25 respectively corresponding to the average nitrogen removal rates nrrs of 1 18 0 07 1 15 0 15 and 1 13 0 13 g n l d p 0 05 these results imply that the three reactors possessed comparable nitrogen removal capabilities throughout the whole operating period at an identical nlr of 1 32 g n l d in terms of the process stoichiometry the nitrite to ammonium conversion ratios rnitrite ammonium were 1 26 0 13 1 26 0 24 and 1 28 0 21 for reactor w reactor m and reactor s respectively table 1 comparable to previously reported stoichiometric ratios for anammox process 36 37 in regard to the nitrate production to ammonium conversion ratios rnitrate ammonium the values increased from 0 15 to 0 22 as the hydrodynamic conditions become stronger with the hrt decreasing from 4 h to 1 h these results are consistent with ma et al who reported that rnitrate ammonium showed an increasing tendency as the hrt decreased from 3 h to 1 5 h 38 the rnitrate ammonium lower than theoretical values of 0 26 is suggestive of the occurrence of denitrification in the reactors 39 thus our results that the rnitrate ammonium in the order of reactor w reactor m reactor s likely imply the higher denitrification potentials in reactor w than in reactor m and reactor s 3 2 characteristics of anammox biomass during the entire operation period denser anammox biofilm was observed in reactor s hrt 1 h than in reactor m hrt 2 h and reactor w hrt 4 h figure s2 moreover red anammox granules were formed at the bottom of the reactors as a result of the detachment of biomass from carriers interestingly the granules in reactor w were much smaller than those in reactor m and reactor s in addition we found that the eps amounts decreased with the enhancing hydrodynamic conditions despite the fact that comparable nitrogen removal capabilities were achieved in the three reactors specifically the total amounts of eps in reactor w reactor m and reactor s were determined to be 56 11 4 94 33 68 5 21 and 24 12 3 82 mg g vss respectively figure s3 moreover the proteins increased rapidly as compared to polysaccharides leading to a higher protein to polysaccharides ratio pn ps in reactor w the heme c is an important component of the anammox cell and can reflect the activity of anammox bacteria 40 as shown in fig 1 a significantly p 0 05 higher heme c contents were observed in reactor s and reactor m than in reactor w given 1 58 0 33 1 45 0 32 and 0 99 0 18 μmol g vss on average for reactor s reactor m and reactor w respectively the saa was determined to further clarify the response of anammox activity to different hydrodynamic conditions in line with heme c contents the saa increased from 64 69 1 00 119 12 9 64 mg n g vss d as the hydrodynamic conditions became stronger fig 1b further corroborating a higher anammox activity at stronger hydrodynamic conditions these results were supported by a previous study in which the saa increased with increasing upflow velocity under a constant nlr of 5 6 kg n m3 d in an upflow anammox based process 38 also of note is that the above results provide a reasonable explanation for the lower biomass concentrations but comparable nitrogen removal performance of reactor s as compared with reactor m and reactor w i e biomass concentrations were determined to be 7203 8488 and 8652 mg vss l in reactor s reactor m and reactor w at the end of experiment respectively 3 3 microbial community evolution and composition segregation at different hydrodynamic conditions biomass samples were harvested from reactor w reactor m and reactor s on days 10 70 130 and 200 for microbial community analysis alpha diversity indexes were used to compare the biodiversity in different reactors as shown in fig 2 microbial diversity showed significant differences among reactors the microbial richness as measured by chao 1 and observed species indexes was found to be highest in reactor s followed by reactor m and reactor w in that order in line with the patterns of richness indexes higher evenness indexes including shannon and simpson were observed in reactor s and reactor m than in reactor w these results suggest that a stronger hydrodynamic condition resulted in a higher microbial diversity in addition the nmds ordination was used to investigate the dissimilarity of microbial community compositions among reactor w reactor m and reactor s as visualized in fig 3 the microbial communities of the 36 samples from the three reactors could be clearly clustered into three different groups suggesting the presence of distinct community compositions in the three reactors the differences were further confirmed as statistically significant by multi response permutation procedures mrpp p 0 001 a 0 2654 taxonomic analysis revealed that the most abundant representatives were planctomycetes proteobacteria chlorobi and chloroflexi phyla in all samples fig 4 specifically the sequences related to anammox like planctomycetes made up on average 36 48 32 15 and 42 71 of the total 16s rrna gene derived from the samples collected from reactor w reactor m and reactor s respectively the abundance of planctomycetes increased progressively with the operational time regardless of the hydrodynamic conditions the average relative abundances of other dominant phyla in reactor w reactor m and reactor s were respectively 19 19 16 04 and 15 25 for proteobacteria 16 48 19 75 and 12 82 for chlorobi and 18 17 14 93 and 11 25 for chloroflexi these four dominant phyla constituted 82 03 90 32 of the total community in the present study signifying their important roles in anammox cultures other minor phyla average relative abundance 10 included oc31 armatimonadetes acidobacteria armatimonadetes and od1 note that the relative abundance of phylum oc31 was significantly p 0 001 higher in reactor s 6 32 and reactor m 7 35 than that in reactor w 0 09 while the abundance of phylum od1 was significantly p 0 001 higher in reactor w 2 78 than that in reactor m 0 49 and reactor s 0 79 fig 4 additionally heterotrophic rhodocyclaceae and comamonadaceae members of which are capable of heterotrophic denitrification 41 were also detected in three reactors rhodocyclaceae and comamonadaceae were both much more abundant in reactor w 12 07 and 0 49 and reactor m 8 90 and 0 61 than in reactor s 6 77 and 0 92 figure s4a this result indicates the high degree of denitrification process in reactor w as compared with that in reactor m and reactor s and consequently resulted in the lower nitrate production in reactor w than in reactor m and reactor s as mentioned above table 1 3 4 dynamics of the anammox populations the genera ca brocadia ca kuenenia and ca jettenia were detected in all samples in the present study notably genus ca kuenenia only accounted for a very small proportion of the microbial community throughout the operation period regardless of hydrodynamic conditions with the average relative abundances of 0 01 0 01 and 0 02 for reactor w reactor m and reactor s respectively fig 5 and table s3 the relative abundance of genus ca jettenia decreased with the increasing hydrodynamic wash given the average relative abundance of 27 54 22 71 and 12 46 for reactor w reactor m and reactor s respectively fig 5 and table s3 the opposite trend for relative abundance of ca brocadia was observed i e the genus ca brocadia was found to be most abundant in reactor s 19 89 followed by reactor m 2 50 and reactor w 0 53 moreover it was found that the relative abundance of ca jettenia remained relatively stable in reactor m and reactor s but increased gradually in reactor w with extended operation in comparison the relative abundance of ca brocadia which remained relatively stable in reactor w increased continuously in reactor m and reactor s throughout the operation period fig 5 more importantly in contrast to ca jettenia being the predominant anammox genus in reactor w and reactor m consistently throughout the operation period a population shift from ca jettenia to ca brocadia occurred in reactor s specifically after 70 days operation at a strong hydrodynamic wash with the increasing population from 5 20 on day 10 to 14 17 on day 70 ca brocadia outcompeted ca jettenia and became the dominant genus in reactor s 3 5 bacterial associations of the three anammox communities to discern the bacterial interactions of the anammox microbial communities rmt based networks were constructed based on correlation relationships fig 6 the global network topology followed a scale free degree distribution with r2 being 0 79 0 80 and 0 78 for reactor w reactor m and reactor s microbial community respectively meaning that most nodes otus in networks had few links while only a few hub nodes had numerous links moreover similar to those in other ecosystems 42 43 the modularity average path lengths avg gd and average clustering coefficient avg cc of the empirical networks were greater than their corresponding random networks table 2 indicating the small world and modular characteristics of network 44 the resulting bacterial networks consisted of 76 nodes linked by 173 edges 41 04 positive and 58 96 negative 106 nodes linked by 166 edges 43 98 positive and 56 02 negative and 106 nodes linked by 324 edges 50 31 positive and 49 69 negative for reactor w reactor m and reactor s microbial community respectively table 2 table s4 s5 and s6 in addition it is striking that all interactions without exception in networks with different hydrodynamic wash between nodes belonging to planctomycetes and nodes belonging to chloroflexi were negative table s4 s5 and s6 this suggested that there are strong negative correlations between planctomycetes and chloroflexi moreover we found that most of the taxa that positively correlated with anammox related bacteria were affiliated with phylum planctomycetes and proteobacteria which might benefited the anammox community or assisted with anammox community shift based on the above constructed networks we examined whether otus in anammox communities with different hydrodynamic wash exhibited unique topological features and compared the network topological features of the three anammox communities as shown in table 2 the modularity was highest in reactor m community followed by reactor w and reactor s community the betweenness centrality bc is indicative of the relative importance of control potential that an otu exerts on the interactions of other otus in its own network 45 in this study significantly higher bc value were observed for otus in reactor m community than those in reactor w p 0 01 and reactor s community p 0 001 figure s5a the average degree avg k and clustering coefficient avg cc followed an opposite trend with significant differences p 0 01 were observed across the three networks figure s5b and c moreover the smaller average geodesic distance gd value in reactor s suggested stronger interactions between species the analysis of modular topological features is important to identify key populations based on the nodes topological roles in their own network the topological roles of nodes can be defined by two parameters within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity pi according to the threshold values of zi and pi 34 the roles of nodes were classified into four categories peripherals connectors module hubs and network hubs the topological roles of nodes in the three networks were illustrated in z p plot fig 7 majority of the nodes in three networks 84 21 for reactor w 98 11 for reactor m and 96 23 for reactor s were categorized as peripherals specialists that have only a few links and most of their links were inside their own modules apparent differences in the specialists composition were found among the three reactors for instance 4 5 and 9 specialists nodes belonging to anammox otus were found in reactor w reactor m and reactor s respectively among the found anammox related specialists 1 out of 5 2 out of 5 and 4 out of 9 specialists fall within genus ca brocadia in reactor w reactor m and reactor s respectively moreover a total of 18 nodes 12 for reactor w 2 for reactor m and 4 for reactor s were categorized as connectors or module hubs generalists that are highly connected to several modules or highly connected to many nodes in their own modules note that no node was categorized as network hub supergeneralists in the three networks it has been suggested that the microorganisms acting as generalists roles are of high importance to maintain the stability and functions of ecosystems 46 it is interesting to note that the nodes identified as generalists in the three networks were different from each other fig 7 indicating that different keystone species maintained the stability and functions of reactors operated under different hydrodynamic wash conditions moreover for the shared otus a total of 38 otus were shared by the three networks no significant p 0 05 relationships were found for the zi value among the three networks taken together these results suggested that hydrodynamic wash greatly altered the network structure and the topological roles of individual otu and key microbial populations 4 discussion 4 1 influence of hydrodynamic conditions on anammox process in this study different hydrodynamic conditions resulted in distinct anammox biomass characteristics i e larger anammox granules in reactor s were observed than those in reactor m and reactor w this was likely due to the stronger hydrodynamic shear force induced by the higher liquid upflow velocity in reactor s two and four times higher than that in reactor m and reactor w respectively which can aid in the formation of bigger granules in upflow anammox reactors 13 14 moreover our results showed that the eps contents decreased with the increasing degree of hydrodynamic wash the fact that different hydrodynamic wash and or upflow velocities in this study resulted in different washout rates of dissolved organic carbon derived from anammox reaction 47 therefore it could be expected that the eps content was lowest in reactor s followed by reactor m and reactor w in that order on the other hand distinct microbial compositions which were responsible for eps production and degradation 48 likely contributed to the different eps contents in the three reactors it was suggested that the eps can be an important carbon source for denitrification in anammox based processes 49 thus the higher eps contents likely led to higher degree of denitrification in reactor w and reactor m compared with that in reactor s which was in agreement with the result of process stoichiometry i e lower rnitrate ammonium in reactor w and reactor m than in reactor s more importantly it has been demonstrated that the presence of organic matter would negatively influence the anammox activity 50 51 thus the higher eps contents likely cause a higher degree of inhibition of anammox bacterial activity in reactor w as compared with those in reactor m and reactor s additionally the increasing liquid upflow velocity could enhanced the external mass transfer which is beneficial for the bacterial activity 52 similarly guo et al 18 recently reported that the anammox metabolic activity characterized by heme c content and transcription level of hzsa gene was gradually increased with decreasing hrt from 36 h to 1 h additionally it is known that as the srt increases the fraction of active biomass decreases 53 thus a longer srt as a result of less biomass washout at lower upflow velocity would lead to a higher fraction of dormancy or inactive cells and consequently resulted in lower anammox bacterial activity in reactor w 4 2 influence of hydrodynamic wash on microbial community of anammox process nmds analysis showed significant p 0 001 differences in the community structure among reactors operated under different hydrodynamic wash suggesting that the hydrodynamic wash exerted a substantial influence on the anammox community composition indeed the hydrodynamic wash influence srt significantly 54 55 in this study stronger hydrodynamic stresses or washout in reactor s resulted in shorter srts as compared with those in reactor m and reactor w more severe biomass washout in reactor s averaged at 0 55 mg l as compared with those in reactor m 0 22 mg l and reactor w 0 08 mg l were observed during a 20 days observations from day 180 to day 200 besides it has been demonstrated that genus ca brocadia has a higher growth rate than ca jettenia 4 therefore genus ca brocadia could out compete ca jettenia in reactor s after long term operation under strong hydrodynamic wash the coexistence of microorganisms belonging to heterotrophic chloroflexi has commonly found in anammox reactors fed with cod free synthetic wastewater 56 57 previous study has indicated that heterotrophic chloroflexi preferentially utilized cellular compounds released from the dead biomass and metabolites of autotrophic bacteria 58 59 in this study the higher abundance of chloroflexi in reactor w operated under weak hydrodynamic wash may be related to a longer srt which resulted in a higher degree of biomass decay moreover the lower washout rate also led to a higher degree of accumulation of metabolic wastes in reactor w which promoted the growth of chloroflexi additionally on the basis of the commensalistic relationship between chloroflexi and planctomycetes chloroflexi cross feed on compounds that are produced by planctomycetes the shift in the abundance of chloroflexi was expected to be positively correlated with that of planctomycetes however actual results in this study suggest otherwise without exception the abundance of planctomycetes increased continuously with extended operation in the three reactors while chloroflexi showed the opposite trend this result was supported by network analysis which showed that all interactions between nodes belonging to planctomycetes and nodes belonging to chloroflexi were negative connan et al 60 also observed a similar result with the shift in the abundance of chloroflexi being independent of the shift in the abundance of planctomycetes in their time series data set these findings therefore highlight the need to evaluate accurately the ecophysiological role s of coexisting chloroflexi in anammox cultures additionally our results showed that hydrodynamic wash greatly altered the network structure and the ecological roles of individual otu and key microbial populations specifically clear differences in the specialists composition especially anammox related specialists were found among the three reactors suggesting that the hydrodynamic wash play a key role in impacting the topological roles of anammox related otus importantly we found that among the 18 generalists detected in three networks only one anammox related otu was assigned suggesting that keystone otus are not always necessary to be anammox bacteria in anammox enriched culture moreover the lower modularity which reflect habitat heterogeneity in network of reactor s indicated a lower degree of niche differentiation in reactor s 61 it has been demonstrated that significant niche differentiation could inhibit the bacterial interactions between species 62 therefore the lower degree of niche differentiation likely resulted in stronger interactions between species in reactor s as indicated by smaller gd value moreover it has been demonstrated that the nutrient input can largely stimulate the bacterial interactions 42 44 thus another potential explanation for the stronger interactions between species in reactor s is the enhanced external mass transfer induced by stronger hydrodynamic stresses or washout nonetheless it should be noted that use of correlation based approaches for inferring biotic interactions may produce unreliable results since the obtained data take the form of relative abundances of taxa rather than their absolute abundances 63 moreover environmental heterogeneity complex nonlinear dynamics indirect associations and compositionality of sequencing data all hinder the usefulness of the correlation metrics when inferring direct species species associations 64 thus infallible methodologies should be developed to address these challenges in the future 4 3 implications and research needs hydrodynamic conditions have significant influence on biomass characteristic mass transfer exopolysaccharide production and metabolic genetic behaviors of anammox microbial consortia 2 13 14 in this study we found that operating an anammox reactor under stronger hydrodynamic wash i e shorter hrt can actually improve the activity of anammox bacteria this provides a useful avenue for robust operation of anammox processes on one hand a shorter hrt can result in a higher nlr on the other hand a shorter hrt represents a less reactor volume i e a smaller footprint meanwhile a shorter hrt has a positive impact on the production of anammox bacterial communication signals 65 and enhances the external mass transfer 52 66 which are beneficial for the nitrogen removal performance 67 additionally on the basis of our findings a promising strategy for accelerating the start up of mainstream anammox reactor could be expected that is when seeding sidestream anammox sludge by shortening the hrt to maintain a constant nlr as the inocula mainstream anammox process could be rapidly started up in such a scenario the anammox bacterial activity in mainstream anammox reactor can be largely improved which require much less seeding sludge moreover a population shift from ca jettenia to ca brocadia was observed in reactor s which was likely attributed to the decreased srt and different growth rates of ca jettenia and ca brocadia nonetheless there may be other factors affecting the competition among anammox bacteria such as cell tolerance to various compounds accumulation of metabolites and interactions between anammox species and other bacteria in this study for instance sulfur oxidizing bacteria were highly abundant in the three reactors figure s4b their presences can affect the ecological niche of anammox bacteria by altering anammox activities 68 or directly altering the competition among anammox species 69 moreover the production of eps and heme can also be affected by the dominant anammox species for instance in the current study it was found that as hrt decreased eps content increased while heme content decreased nonetheless due to the limited information on the niche differentiation of anammox species and other community members it is difficult to infer conclusively their competition or their roles in eps and heme production 70 these issues await future investigations in summary we found that heme c content and saas gradually increased as the hrt decrease indicating that shortening hrt could largely improve the activity of anammox bacteria the results of 16s rrna gene sequencing revealed that significant p 0 001 differences in microbial compositions were found among the reactors operated under different hrt moreover it was strikingly to found that anammox like bacteria in the reactors operated at hrt of 2 and 4h were consistently dominated by ca jettenia whereas a population shift from ca jettenia to ca brocadia was observed in the reactor operated at hrt of 1 h additionally network analysis showed that hrt greatly altered the bacterial interactions of anammox process and the ecological roles of individual otu and key microbial populations overall this study provided new insights into bacterial activities microbial structures and associations of anammox processes responding to varying hrt declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
