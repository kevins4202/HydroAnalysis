the major risks can be detected by satellite remote sensing technologies in this study it is aimed to show spatial characteristics of oil spills as well as its dynamics in the time domain of the bay results from a three year period of the study show that as a main environmental problem oil pollution has a relatively high percentage of spatial distribution in the bay it is therefore concluded that regular monitoring of the intense oil pollution in the bay is required with an agile and low cost method of satellite monitoring to intervene in good time and to minimize its impacts the study

marine pollution as a result of excessive and careless intervention in nature by humankind is one important problem of the world oil pollution is one of the major environmental problems in the seas to which maritime activities have an important contribution colak isiacik 2015 and reference therein even though all ship types are potential sources for oil pollution due to their daily operations such as fuel consumption using several types of petroleum derivatives in addition to cleaning processes and casualties oil tankers in particular may generate more oily waste during their lifetime colak

million tons per day liu and wirtz 2009 jean paul rodrigue 2017 intense shipping activities carrying 90 of food and manufactured goods throughout the world have an important impact on the marine environments it is recognized worldwide that a large amount of oil is discharged yearly into the marine environment due to vessel operations and accidents as well as through land based sources shcherbak et al 2008 these discharges pose a serious threat to marine ecosystem as they contaminate marine habitats in the water column and on the surface of the bottom texture as well as coastal habitats in shores and beaches and can persist for several months or even years kostianoy and lavrova 2013 the impact of oil spills on marine organisms can be physiological such as toxicity and

an average life span of 25 30 years in global shipping activities raise the question of the utilization of such huge amounts of resources garmer et al 2015 these end of life vessels are sent for recycling based on their scrap value which usually depends on the price of steel and the freight rate in the related markets ship recycling activities also lead to many problems such as the discharge

the demands o of the dense industrial zone in çandarlı bay oil spill detections were conducted using the sar images of sentinel 1 between january 2015 and december 2017 in order to reach this goal analyses were performed both on an annually 2015 2017 and monthly 2017 basis by merging daily products to evaluate intra annual and inter annual changes in oil spill events results from the analysis are expected to exhibit the impact of intense industrial and maritime zones on the marine ecosystem it is therefore highly recommended that a sustainable environmental management plan be developed by decision makers along with urgent recovery implementation strategies for all regions subject to the extreme pressures of oil pollution 2 study area çandarlı bay is situated in the middle eastern coast of the aegean sea in turkey fig 1 the ecosystem of the bay is negatively impacted by intense industrial and maritime activities as well as being within close proximity to the third most populated city of turkey izmir characteristics of the ecosystem in the bay and its adjacent terrestrial area can be concluded as follows çandarlı bay is located in the transition zone between the black sea water from dardanelles and the mediterranean sea water thus the bay is an important area for trawling in the aegean sea where important commercial species such as red mullet fishery is well developed taşı et al 2011 however knowledge on the ichthyofauna of the bay is limited there are 60 known fish species 11 of them are chondrichthyans while 49 of them belong to teleost özaydın et al 2014 islands in the bay along the coast of foça still host habitats of critically endangered monk seal which is an important species according to the red list given by the international union for conservation of nature iucn this area has been designated as a specially protected area spa since 1990 in order to protect this species and its habitat local conservation efforts including research the promotion of public awareness and marine protection have been carried out in this spa since its establishment üçüncüoğlu et al 2006 the terrestrial area of çandarlı region includes forests semi natural areas agricultural areas olive plantations small urban areas coastal wetlands and water bodies olive trees play an important role in the economy of the region traditionally local people have depended on olive trees for oil olives and other minor products agriculture is a traditional and primary practice for local people in the study area çandarlı is dominated by typical mediterranean flora kesgin and nurlu 2009 besides the existence of these natural values the region is known as the most intense industrial coastal region in the aegean basin one of the biggest rivers of the basin bakırçay river carries industrial waste rich water with limited treatment into the bay csb 2015 these industrial wastes cause a serious negative pressure on the marine ecosystem in the bay çandarlı bay which includes semi closed subsections called aliağa and nemrut bays is a region of immense importance with very dense ship traffic due to provision distributions in accordance with regional requirements as an example heavy marine traffic recorded in 2017 is illustrated in fig 2 piers and port facilities at the nemrut bay are owned by industrial companies located in this area including tupras the second largest oil refinery of turkey petkim a petrochemistry plant 17 industrial facilities related to petkim and other industrial facilities such as ship recycling paper fertilizer iron steel rolling plants liquefied petroleum gas fuel storage and marketing electric power plant cement and concrete and textile however among these industrial facilities tupras petkim and steel mills are the most eminent terminals in the area are visited by liquefied gas tankers chemical tankers oil tankers and general cargo ships deniz et al 2010 a limited number of studies provide information concerning pollution in the studied area despite the extensive industrial activities neşer et al 2012 gives a detailed figure on oil pollution in the region s ship recycling zone in this study it is suggested that aliağa sediments were likely to be contaminated by acutely toxic pah compounds these results raise alarm about the risk posed for the water quality and the ecology of the area güven et al 2008 also provided information on pollution caused by the facilities of refinery and petrochemistry recently tankers visiting the zone for recycling purposes have noticeably increased from 9 in 2016 gemi̇sander 2016 14 in 2017 gemi̇sander 2017 until the end of october and in 2018 it rose to 21 as of the end of november gemi̇sander 2018 the number of ships 5000 dwt or higher tonnage that are subject to marpol agreements annex 1 regulation 13 f imo 2018 with an emphasis on imo phase out single wall tankers between 2005 and 2010 according to their tonnage and fittings are low and between 20 and 30 years old most of these oil tankers coming for recycling are 50 60 years old which are single hull and consequently easily damageable therefore this fact poses another risk to oil pollution 3 material and methods sar is an effective tool to monitor the marine environment and is particularly useful for detecting oil spillages on the water surface simply because the data can be retrieved independently from atmospheric conditions and changes in apparent optical properties of light however wind speed is one of the important variables limiting the performance of oil spill detection wind speed range for detection is reported from 2 m s topouzelis 2008 to 14 m s litovchenko et al 1999 with an optimal speed of 5 6 m s brekke and solberg 2005 oil slick signatures on sar images of the sea surface are often classified into three types natural look alikes and man made oil spills sentinel 1 a and or b sar images can be obtained from esa s sentinels scientific data hub with free access esa 2018a sentinel 1 is the radar sensor developed by the european space agency the main objective of its mission is to provide continuity of c band synthetic aperture radar sar mapping of the earth the sentinel 1 sar instrument has four image modes that can be used in various applications interferometric wide swath mode the most suitable option for oil spill detection has a swath width greater than 240 km 5 m 20 m single look resolution more technical and operational details were reported by eoportal 2019 the most important limitation in the detection of oil spill by sar images is to distinguish between dark patches detected from oil slicks and natural phenomenon solberg et al 2007 the similarity of these dark patches is known to be due to meteorological and or oceanographic conditions as the impacts of these conditions are not continuous over time they are not expected to have a permanent problem uncertainty for a certain area an approach that includes spatial analysis in different temporal groups may overcome such uncertainties a study by esen et al 2012 reported wind characteristics of the region and concluded that the wind magnitude and direction show differences over a one year period the reoccurrence of dark patches in different time periods under various natural conditions provides important insight into the sources of an oil spill however the evaluation on the properties of the oils are not in the scope of this study thus the characteristics of the index on backscattering intensity were only presented in the case of providing information for further studies aimed at detected patches an area that covers çandarlı bay was chosen for the analysis in this study fig 1 the range of wind speeds was reported by esen et al 2012 between 0 and 12 m s with intra annual variations in direction and magnitude for the region therefore it is assumed that the wind properties of the study area prevent any spatial bias in the studied period the remotely sensed data from level 1 ground range detected grd sar images are used in this study to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation of oil spills in the area a total of 210 images from the sar instrument of sentinel 1 collected between 2015 and 2017 were studied and these were specified as the acquisition mode of iw in the product type of grd a series of processes were applied to retrieve daily products of oil spill detection from the images by means of the sentinel application platform snap which is an open source common architecture for esa toolboxes esa 2018b after retrieving daily products for oil spill detection they were put into the binning process in the area binning algorithm of snap was used to calculate monthly and annual products these composite products contained values of average and sum in each time frame with 0 2 km 0 3 km spatial resolution time frames were annual between 2015 and 2017 for evaluation of inter annual variation and monthly in 2017 to evaluate intra annual variation the diagram for processing each step of the study is presented in fig 3 products of each time frame were used in the spatial evaluation of the intensity of detected oil spill throughout the study area to evaluate the temporal variation data sets from each time frame were calculated for an average of all pixels belonging to the area to obtain parameters parameters of average standard deviation mode and median were given to describe the general characteristics of the study area additionally reoccurrence rate which is annual and or monthly frequency of oil spill detection at the same location and percentage of the spatial coverages were calculated 4 results and discussion a total of 210 sampling days were obtained by using satellite images between 2015 and 2017 most of the sampling days 56 of 2017 were for the intra annual evaluation of oil spill detection while the remaining were 22 and 21 of 2015 and 2016 respectively sampling days in 2017 were distributed homogeneously for each month between 7 and 8 table 1 regarding the evaluation of 129 807 pixels 0 2 km 0 3 km resolution for each pixel of the study area the total coverage of the oil spill distributions were 16 4 16 8 and 24 2 in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively the intra annual range of percentage distribution detected oil spill in 2017 dispersed from 7 6 july to 10 5 september and the inter annual average was 8 88 sd 0 85 the constantly detected oil spill in the same location existed in the area during the time period of the study the area with constant oil spill was 4 4 of the total in 2015 and 4 9 in 2016 as it had a coverage percentage with 7 2 in 2017 the intra annual range of constantly detected oil spill in 2017 was 3 2 april to 4 1 september a description of the data set is presented in table 1 the average spatial reoccurrence rates of the oil spill event was 0 15 0 17 in 2015 0 14 0 17 in 2016 and 0 11 0 17 in 2017 an intra annual analysis showed that the reoccurrence rate ranged between 0 22 0 13 in july and 0 31 0 21 in june 0 23 in november in 2017 table 1 changes in the reoccurrence rate showed a sinusoidal pattern throughout the year though the changes were significantly different from each other the most dramatic change was seen between june and july p 0 05 fig 4 the average intensity of oil spill detection was very consistent with a value of 0 83 0 21 in 2015 0 22 in 2016 and 2017 throughout the three year period of the study similar consistency was also observed among the months of 2017 descriptive statistics on temporal changes in the index value of the oil spill was presented in table 1 from the analysis the results are listed below 1 an important issue related to using sar technology refers to the possible look alike problem for detection of oil spills due to natural conditions as explained above even though these false classifications for oil spills appear to be a major problem brekke and solberg 2005 ajadi et al 2018 the limited uncertainty of this problem liu et al 2010 is to encourage the use of this technology for detecting oil anomalies especially in large areas fingas and brown 2014 since previous studies from the aegean sea indicated that çandarlı bay had an inter annual variation of winds and waves soukissian 2005 esen et al 2012 the inter annual pattern within an acceptable range for algorithms provides an advantage to evaluate bias uncertainty by look alikes an analysis of this study showed a temporal consistency for the constant percentages of oil slick table 1 and the cumulative percentage showed a logarithmic increase by increasing sampling days fig 5 any major deviation from these parameters might help to detect any extraordinary oil spill event in the region these results confirm that spatial analysis on multiple uses of the sar products with different time groups is an effective approach to monitor and understand the impact of constant oil spill in a large area 2 even though spatial analysis showed oil spill detection over the entire bay constant detections were concentrated around an intense industrial region especially the ship recycling and refinery zones additionally at the defined anchoring zones of these facilities oil spill intensities independent of each sampling year fig 6 were seen among the industrial facilities in the region the ship recycling zone showed a narrow spatial constant impact based on the analysis in contrast the widest constant impacts were detected in the region of the facility of refinery and petrochemistry it is possible that the reason for this difference stems from the amount of leakage from the ships while the source of pollution in the recycling area is mostly from the fuel and sludge tanks lubrication oil from the machinery parts the cleaning operations and accidental leakage from the ships etc any problem in the loading unloading process might be a reason for leakage into the sea as oil contamination into coastal water by the recycling activities is not direct and may change depending on physical forces such as wave effect development and capacity building in these facilities petkim 2018 and an increasing amount and tonnage of ship recycling gemi̇sander 2016 2017 and 2018 make the area more sensitive for systematic monitoring and urgent intervention plans 3 a temporal analysis showed that a very high percentage of oil spill detection is the constant for çandarlı bay throughout the sampling period the number of sampling days for each year is the reason for differences in spatial coverage of the detected oil spill additionally the normalized percentage of distribution illustrates that the relationship between the percentage of the distribution and the number of sampling days is not linear based on the three year data set of the study the inferential approach indicates that annual distribution of detected oil spill is approximately 20 of the bay area for the case of all year sampling fig 5 eronat 2018 applied the same approach in the coastal zone of eastern cyprus where there are no heavy industrial activities the comparison also indicated that the percentage of the annual oil spill distribution in çandarlı bay is approximately three times higher than the coastal zone in eastern cyprus 4 intra annual variations indicated changes among months fig 2 however these changes dispersed around a constant residual value over the period of 2017 intra annual variations also reflect the continuous operation and marine traffic in the bay distinctively july showed a slightly less area coverage for the detection of constant oil spill in the area this might be due to the changing amount of shipping subject to the impact of a wind regime in that period it would not therefore be appropriate to reach a certain assessment yet as the intra annual maritime statistics of the bay are not fully available for 2017 on the other hand the detection of constant residual impact will also make it possible to measure the recovery impact of any further action or management plans the composite products obtained by spatial analysis indicate the annual impact of oil spills dispersed all over the bay additionally the total coastline of the bay has been under the impact of oil pollution throughout the years there are also spatial intensifications to the coastal zone where the heavy industrial zone is located and its adjacent waters including anchorage areas are subject to the impacts of oil pollution fig 6 5 conclusions maritime activities including shipping and ship recycling industry based sources of oil pollution and discharge of industrial waste have been considered as serious environmental problems in çandarlı bay among these problems oil pollution is of particular importance and is causing greater levels of concern with the passing of each day the dimensions of the oil pollution in çandarlı bay are shown in this study using sar images one of the major advantages of this type of monitoring is to be able to determine the oil spill parameters such as location linear size and spill areas spatial and temporal information i e oil spill distributions at the sea and its propagations allows the users and decision makers to evaluate the major causes and sources of oil spills and to take appropriate measures in a timely manner the main findings and ideas resulting from this study can be summarized as follows 1 satellite monitoring is an efficient tool for the gathering visualization and analysis of information on oil spills in the marine environment making the use of this approach core to the for seen oil spill monitoring system 2 with this tool the problems tasks of the analysis the modelling and forecasting of natural processes influencing the drift and spreading of the oil spills can also be done successfully 3 satellite monitoring can qualitatively and quantitatively characterize not only the spatial and temporal distribution of oil spills but also the environmental conditions of the sea basins as a whole 4 imagery monitoring that provides tools and information for the authorities combating pollution is considered to be a very useful tool for environmental managers and other stakeholders in order to support the decision making process applying the achievements of satellite technologies to the monitoring of oil spills in the marine environment will not only allow spill distribution to be obtained but will also track the environmental consequences and lead to preventive measures being undertaken 5 taking into account the modern tendencies for oil transportation in the region there is an urgent need to create a monitoring system based on satellite imagery the integration of all types of information systems and resources on the bay level within a single monitoring system is also foreseen

subject to marpol agreements annex 1 regulation 13 f imo 2018 with an emphasis on imo phase out single wall tankers between 2005 and 2010 according to their tonnage and fittings are low and between 20 and 30 years old most of these oil tankers coming for recycling are 50 60 years old which are single hull and consequently easily damageable therefore this fact poses another risk to oil pollution 3 material and methods sar is an effective tool to monitor the marine environment and is particularly useful for detecting oil spillages on the water surface simply because the data can be retrieved independently from atmospheric conditions and changes in apparent optical properties of light however wind speed is one of the important variables limiting the performance of oil spill detection wind speed range for detection is reported from 2 m s topouzelis 2008 to 14 m s litovchenko et al 1999 with an optimal speed of 5 6 m s brekke and solberg 2005 oil slick signatures on sar images of the sea surface are often classified into three types natural look alikes and man made oil spills sentinel 1 a and or b sar images can be obtained from esa s sentinels scientific data hub with free access esa 2018a sentinel 1 is the radar sensor developed by the european space agency the main objective of its mission is to provide continuity of c band synthetic aperture radar sar mapping of the earth the sentinel 1 sar instrument has four image modes that can be used in various applications interferometric wide swath mode the most suitable option for oil spill detection has a swath width greater than 240 km 5 m 20 m single look resolution more technical and operational details were reported by eoportal 2019 the most important limitation in the detection of oil spill by sar images is to distinguish between dark patches detected from oil slicks and natural phenomenon solberg et al 2007 the similarity of these dark patches is known to be due to meteorological and or oceanographic conditions as the impacts of these conditions are not continuous over time they are not expected to have a permanent problem uncertainty for a certain area an approach that includes spatial analysis in different temporal groups may overcome such uncertainties a study by esen et al 2012 reported wind characteristics of the region and concluded that the wind magnitude and direction show differences over a one year period the reoccurrence of dark patches in different time periods under various natural conditions provides important insight into the sources of an oil spill however the evaluation on the properties of the oils are not in the scope of this study thus the characteristics of the index on backscattering intensity were only presented in the case of providing information for further studies aimed at detected patches an area that covers çandarlı bay was chosen for the analysis in this study fig 1 the range of wind speeds was reported by esen et al 2012 between 0 and 12 m s with intra annual variations in direction and magnitude for the region therefore it is assumed that the wind properties of the study area prevent any spatial bias in the studied period the remotely sensed data from level 1 ground range detected grd sar images are used in this study to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation of oil spills in the area a total of 210 images from the sar instrument of sentinel 1 collected between 2015 and 2017 were studied and these were specified as the acquisition mode of iw in the product type of grd a series of processes were applied to retrieve daily products of oil spill detection from the images by means of the sentinel application platform snap which is an open source common architecture for esa toolboxes esa 2018b after retrieving daily products for oil spill detection they were put into the binning process in the area binning algorithm of snap was used to calculate monthly and annual products these composite products contained values of average and sum in each time frame with 0 2 km 0 3 km spatial resolution time frames were annual between 2015 and 2017 for evaluation of inter annual variation and monthly in 2017 to evaluate intra annual variation the diagram for processing each step of the study is presented in fig 3 products of each time frame were used in the spatial evaluation of the intensity of detected oil spill throughout the study area to evaluate the temporal variation data sets from each time frame were calculated for an average of all pixels belonging to the area to obtain parameters parameters of average standard deviation mode and median were given to describe the general characteristics of the study area additionally reoccurrence rate which is annual and or monthly frequency of oil spill detection at the same location and percentage of the spatial coverages were calculated 4 results and discussion a total of 210 sampling days were obtained by using satellite images between 2015 and 2017 most of the sampling days 56 of 2017 were for the intra annual evaluation of oil spill detection while the remaining were 22 and 21 of 2015 and 2016 respectively sampling days in 2017 were distributed homogeneously for each month between 7 and 8 table 1 regarding the evaluation of 129 807 pixels 0 2 km 0 3 km resolution for each pixel of the study area the total coverage of the oil spill distributions were 16 4 16 8 and 24 2 in 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively the intra annual range of percentage distribution detected oil spill in 2017 dispersed from 7 6 july to 10 5 september and the inter annual average was 8 88 sd 0 85 the constantly detected oil spill in the same location existed in the area during the time period of the study the area with constant oil spill was 4 4 of the total in 2015 and 4 9 in 2016 as it had a coverage percentage with 7 2 in 2017 the intra annual range of constantly detected oil spill in 2017 was 3 2 april to 4 1 september a description of the data set is presented in table 1 the average spatial reoccurrence rates of the oil spill event was 0 15 0 17 in 2015 0 14 0 17 in 2016 and 0 11 0 17 in 2017 an intra annual analysis showed that the reoccurrence rate ranged between 0 22 0 13 in july and 0 31 0 21 in june 0 23 in november in 2017 table 1 changes in the reoccurrence rate showed a sinusoidal pattern throughout the year though the changes were significantly different from each other the most dramatic change was seen between june and july p 0 05 fig 4 the average intensity of oil spill detection was very consistent with a value of 0 83 0 21 in 2015 0 22 in 2016 and 2017 throughout the three year period of the study similar consistency was also observed among the months of 2017 descriptive statistics on temporal changes in the index value of the oil spill was presented in table 1 from the analysis the results are listed below 1 an important issue related to using sar technology refers to the possible look alike problem for detection of oil spills due to natural conditions as explained above even though these false classifications for oil spills appear to be a major problem brekke and solberg 2005 ajadi et al 2018 the limited uncertainty of this problem liu et al 2010 is to encourage the use of this technology for detecting oil anomalies especially in large areas fingas and brown 2014 since previous studies from the aegean sea indicated that çandarlı bay had an inter annual variation of winds and waves soukissian 2005 esen et al 2012 the inter annual pattern within an acceptable range for algorithms provides an advantage to evaluate bias uncertainty by look alikes an analysis of this study showed a temporal consistency for the constant percentages of oil slick table 1 and the cumulative percentage showed a logarithmic increase by increasing sampling days fig 5 any major deviation from these parameters might help to detect any extraordinary oil spill event in the region these results confirm that spatial analysis on multiple uses of the sar products with different time groups is an effective approach to monitor and understand the impact of constant oil spill in a large area 2 even though spatial analysis showed oil spill detection over the entire bay constant detections were concentrated around an intense industrial region especially the ship recycling and refinery zones additionally at the defined anchoring zones of these facilities oil spill intensities independent of each sampling year fig 6 were seen among the industrial facilities in the region the ship recycling zone showed a narrow spatial constant impact based on the analysis in contrast the widest constant impacts were detected in the region of the facility of refinery and petrochemistry it is possible that the reason for this difference stems from the amount of leakage from the ships while the source of pollution in the recycling area is mostly from the fuel and sludge tanks lubrication oil from the machinery parts the cleaning operations and accidental leakage from the ships etc any problem in the loading unloading process might be a reason for leakage into the sea as oil contamination into coastal water by the recycling activities is not direct and may change depending on physical forces such as wave effect development and capacity building in these facilities petkim 2018 and an increasing amount and tonnage of ship recycling gemi̇sander 2016 2017 and 2018 make the area more sensitive for systematic monitoring and urgent intervention plans 3 a temporal analysis showed that a very high percentage of oil spill detection is the constant for çandarlı bay throughout the sampling period the number of sampling days for each year is the reason for differences in spatial coverage of the detected oil spill additionally the normalized percentage of distribution illustrates that the relationship between the percentage of the distribution and the number of sampling days is not linear based on the three year data set of the study the inferential approach indicates that annual distribution of detected oil spill is approximately 20 of the bay area for the case of all year sampling fig 5 eronat 2018 applied the same approach in the coastal zone of eastern cyprus where there are no heavy industrial activities the comparison also indicated that the percentage of the annual oil spill distribution in çandarlı bay is approximately three times higher than the coastal zone in eastern cyprus 4 intra annual variations indicated changes among months fig 2 however these changes dispersed around a constant residual value over the period of 2017 intra annual variations also reflect the continuous operation and marine traffic in the bay distinctively july showed a slightly less area coverage for the detection of constant oil spill in the area this might be due to the changing amount of shipping subject to the impact of a wind regime in that period it would not therefore be appropriate to reach a certain assessment yet as the intra annual maritime statistics of the bay are not fully available for 2017 on the other hand the detection of constant residual impact will also make it possible to measure the recovery impact of any further action or management plans the composite products obtained by spatial analysis indicate the annual impact of oil spills dispersed all over the bay additionally the total coastline of the bay has been under the impact of oil pollution throughout the years there are also spatial intensifications to the coastal zone where the heavy industrial zone is located and its adjacent waters including anchorage areas are subject to the impacts of oil pollution fig 6 5 conclusions maritime activities including shipping and ship recycling industry based sources of oil pollution and discharge of industrial waste have been considered as serious environmental problems in çandarlı bay among these problems oil pollution is of particular importance and is causing greater levels of concern with the passing of each day the dimensions of the oil pollution in çandarlı bay are shown in this study using sar images one of the major advantages of this type of monitoring is to be able to determine the oil spill parameters such as location linear size and spill areas spatial and temporal information i e oil spill distributions at the sea and its propagations allows the users and decision makers to evaluate the major causes and sources of oil spills and to take appropriate measures in a timely manner the main findings and ideas resulting from this study can be summarized as follows 1 satellite monitoring is an efficient tool for the gathering visualization and analysis of information on oil spills in the marine environment making the use of this approach core to the for seen oil spill monitoring system 2 with this tool the problems tasks of the analysis the modelling and forecasting of natural processes influencing the drift and spreading of the oil spills can also be done successfully 3 satellite monitoring can qualitatively and quantitatively characterize not only the spatial and temporal distribution of oil spills but also the environmental conditions of the sea basins as a whole 4 imagery monitoring that provides tools and information for the authorities combating pollution is considered to be a very useful tool for environmental managers and other stakeholders in order to support the decision making process applying the achievements of satellite technologies to the monitoring of oil spills in the marine environment will not only allow spill distribution to be obtained but will also track the environmental consequences and lead to preventive measures being undertaken 5 taking into account the modern tendencies for oil transportation in the region there is an urgent need to create a monitoring system based on satellite imagery the integration of all types of information systems and resources on the bay level within a single monitoring system is also foreseen 
22601,in the maritime literature collision diameter is the distance between the ship centers for physical contact the collision diameter as described in the literature neglects the drifting of the ship from its course external forces such as the cross wind and or cross current may cause drifting of the ship which can be observed as a differentiation between course over ground cog and heading hdg in this study a detailed discussion of maritime encounters based on molecular collision theory and the lacking points at the existing approaches are discussed calculations are modified to obtain a more realistic collision diameter the novelty of the developed collision diameter is the usage of hdg and cog in the collision diameter equation which accounts for the drifting due to external forces the developed collision diameter is applied to the strait of istanbul where fluctuating water currents are continuously affecting the ships during their navigation the results are compared with the classical collision diameter approach the variation in the collision diameter values compared to the standard approach reaches up to 71 maximum improvement is observed in the crossing collisions whereas the head on and take over collisions are also affected due to relative drifting of the ships keywords collision diameter maritime risk maritime accident probability maritime traffic automatic identification system strait of istanbul 1 introduction quantifying the maritime collision probability is an important step towards mitigating the overall collision risk of the waterway gracat friis hansen and simonsen 2002 iwrap friis hansen 2008 samson degré et al 2003 are few of the tools dedicated to the quantification of for accident risk all of these tools that are reviewed in detail by pedersen 2010 depend on the pioneering quantification models developed by fujii and shiobara 1971 and macduff 1974 their models use equation 1 1 p coll p g p caus where p c o l l is the probability of

calculating the encounter probability in addition to these two approaches montewka et al 2010 used minimum distance to collision mdtc for calculating the distance between the vessels is not enough to perform efficient anti collision maneuvers and quantifying the vessel collision probability collision diameter approach which is the main focus of this study considers the physical contact of the ships and is based on molecular collision theory in the original theory the number of molecular collisions in a specific volume is given as the product of collision cross section density and the relative velocity of the molecules the theory depends on three assumptions all particles have linear trajectories through the observed space all particles have spherical shapes only two particles are involved in one collision when molecular collision theory is adapted to the maritime accident probability calculations the assumptions are modified as all ship paths are straight lines through the observed area all ships have rectangular shapes only two ships are involved in the collision in the scope of this paper a new collision diameter is developed based on the modification discussion outcomes the proposed formula accounts for the drifting of ships due to the cross current and cross wind and calculates the physically correct collision diameter the remaining part of the paper is structured as the following in section 2 the problem definition and evolution of the collision diameter concept in the literature are given the proposed collision diameter methodology is discussed in section 3 section 4 discusses the results including a comparison of the proposed collision diameter with the classical collision diameter by applying both to the strait of istanbul in the conclusion section findings are summarized and critically discussed along with the contributions achieved 2 problem definition 2 1 collision diameter foundations of a large number of geometric collision models in the literature are based on the molecular collision theory the theory states that if two randomly moving particle centers are within a certain distance there will be a collision this specific distance is called the collision diameter knowing the collision condition the number of collisions can be calculated via collision diameter trajectory density and the velocity of the particles as the theory is adopted to maritime accidents some modifications are applied ships are assumed to be navigating blindly similar to the random motion of molecules the control and or ability of the captain technical problems and the environmental effects are considered in the causation probability part the actual collision probability can be calculated as a product of encounter and causation probabilities in this study the focus will be on the encounter probability of the vessels the pioneering study of fujii and shiobara 1971 use the molecular collision theory for calculating the number of collisions in japanese waters in their study ship densities are found from radar images or from traffic volumes whereas ship velocities are rough estimations for three types of collisions head on take over and crossing collision diameter is calculated the number of accidents for the observed time is formulated pedersen 1995 improved the fujii and shiobara 1971 approach by introducing a general formula for the collision diameter according to the study the collision diameter is a function of ship dimensions loa and beam velocities and meeting angles of the encountering ships the collision diameter is discussed with trigonometric functions and drawings by friis hansen 2008 at his detailed study for iwrap explained with trigonometric functions and drawings the collision diameter can be defined as the maximum possible length of the projection of ship dimensions on to a line which is perpendicular to relative velocity of the ships at the contact condition when these studies and other studies that are using the same approach are researched and compared with the collision diameter definition the parameter that is used for the projection of the ship dimensions is used wrongly this problem can result from two reasons the problem during the adaptation of the molecular collision theory to maritime collisions the insufficient data in molecular collision theory all particles are assumed spheres that means that the particle is symmetrical from every angle heading and travel direction of the particle can also be called as course over ground are always the same however ships are more rectangular rather than spherical the ship has a bow and the heading of the ship points forward in the direction of the bow but the ship s travel direction which is represented as the course over ground is not always the same as the bow direction in the presence of a drifting motion course over ground cog deviates from its heading hdg this deviation varies the projection angle of the ship onto the collision diameter line as a result the collision diameter varies with the drifting motion with the introduction of automatic identification system ais the information available to the maritime traffic has increased databases are used to analyze and understand navigational patterns along the waterways aarsæther and moan 2009 altan and otay 2017 breithaupt et al 2017 shu et al 2017 wu et al 2017 xiao et al 2015 zhanghao et al 2010 these databases contain static and dynamic information regarding the navigation of the vessels dynamic data contains the hdg and cog values of the ships during their voyage as the dynamic datasets are further investigated the drifting motion of the ships are frequently observed gao et al 2017 shu et al 2017 in ship motions around the world considering these two facts described above this paper attempts to account for the drifting motion of the ships on collision diameter to the best of author s knowledge silveira et al 2014 is the only study which uses a collision diameter similar that is described in this study in silveira et al 2014 study the ship dimensions have been projected on the collision diameter line and the number of collision probabilities have been calculated however in their study the calculation reasoning and details are not discussed the main added values of present study can be listed as the reasoning of the collision diameter the calculation step descriptions the comparison of the collision diameter results in a real waterway where drifting of ships is clearly observed 2 2 strait of istanbul as a test case strait of istanbul soi is one of the most complicated waterways of the world in terms of navigation there are three major reasons for its complication first the transit traffic has to navigate through a local traffic which is eight times denser than the transit traffic altan and otay 2017 the transit traffic and local traffic routes intersect within a crossing manner during the navigation the second reason is the continuous maneuvering of the ships these maneuvers can reach up to 80 at certain parts of the soi besides these maneuvers have to be executed in a narrow waterway where the average width is 0 8 nm in addition the ships have to deal with strong currents in the soi which is the third reason for its complication the main cause of the surface currents in the soi is the elevation difference between water levels in the black sea and the marmara sea however which makes the surface current more complex is the lower layer current due to salinity difference between the marmara sea and the black sea özsoy et al 1996 due to the complexity of the flow regime the surface currents are continuously changing these surface currents can cause drifting motions especially between rumeli kavağı and üsküdar where the maneuvers and cross currents intensify the transit traffic in the soi is regulated by the vessel traffic system vts with a traffic separation scheme tss as given in fig 1 the transit ships are obligated to use the right hand side of the waterway the local ships ferries scheduled and unscheduled passenger ships have to keep clear from the transit traffic and they should spend minimum time inside the transit traffic zone the speed limit for the ships is 10 knots and unless it is necessary ships should strictly observe the speed limit if there is a ship inside the soi with a loa bigger than 200 m vts operators may switch to unidirectional traffic instead of bidirectional traffic when unidirectional traffic is used transit ships are allowed to use both lanes of the tss in addition to these rules it is recommended to use pilot services but officially it is not enforced 3 methodology in this section a new collision diameter is developed with the following the steps definition of the collision diameter discussion of the variables and missing aspects development of the proposed collision diameter application of the proposed collision diameter 3 1 the definition of collision diameter according to pedersen 1995 the collision diameter can be calculated as in equation 2 2 d ij l i v j l j v i v ij sin θ b j 1 sin θ v i v ij 2 1 2 b i 1 sin θ v j v ij 2 1 2 where d i j is the collision diameter of the ships navigating at ith and jth waterway l is the length of the ship b is the width of the ship v i is the velocity of the ith ship v j is the velocity of the jth ship v i j is the relative velocity of the ith and jth ships θ is the angle between the velocity vectors in equation 2 length width and velocity of the ships are direct inputs meeting angle and relative velocity of the ships are calculated from cog also the meeting angle of the ships determines the meeting type take over meeting θ 0 10 crossing meeting 10 θ 170 head on meeting θ 180 10 if the ships are on take over or head on meeting the meeting angle θ in equation 2 is assumed as 0 or 180 respectively and the collision diameter is equal to the sum of the widths of the two ships for crossing meetings equation 2 can be applied with the given θ value the trigonometric representation of the collision diameter is given by detailed drawing of friis hansen 2008 in fig 2 as shown in the figure d ij is the projection of the ship dimensions onto collision diameter line and the velocities v i v j and the relative velocity v i j of the ships create a triangle by using the law of sines the relation between the velocity vectors can be written as 3 sin θ v ij sin β v j sin α v i considering fig 2 and equation 3 the angles θ β α can be re written with the application of pythagorean trigonometric identity as 4 θ co g i co g j 5 β arcsin v j sin θ v ij 6 α arcsin v i sin θ v ij first term on the right hand side of equation 2 can be re written with the help of equations 4 6 as 7 l i v j l j v i v ij sin θ l i sin β l j sin α the equivalent of equation 7 as presented in fig 2 is 8 l i sin β l j sin α d 1 d 3 d 5 the second and the third terms on the right hand side of equation 2 can be re written using equations 4 6 as 9 b i 1 sin θ v j v ij 2 1 2 b i cos β 10 b j 1 sin θ v i v ij 2 1 2 b j cos α the equivalent sum of equations 9 and 10 is represented in fig 2 as 11 b j cos α b i cos β d 2 d 4 from equations 8 and 11 the collision diameter d i j can be re written as in equation 12 which is an alternative form of pedersen s original formula of equation 2 12 d ij l i sin α l j sin β b i cos β b j cos α equation 12 will be later developed for drifting angles in section 3 3 this form is preferred over equation 2 because it is clearer in its term of geometric projections 3 2 discussion of the variables according to the collision diameter definition given in section 2 1 the overall calculation methodology of the pedersen s 1995 collision diameter calculation can be schematized as in fig 3 fig 3 indicates alignment of collision diameter and vector projection of the ship dimensions as the two important parameters collision diameter alignment is perpendicular to relative velocity of the ships since the relative velocity is calculated according to velocity and cog of the ships collision diameter alignment also depends on these two parameters the length of the collision diameter is the vector projection of the ship dimension on to the collision diameter alignment since the ship by itself is assumed as the vector that will be projected on the collision diameter line ship s bow stern alignment is the direction of the projected vector in equation 2 the alignment and the length of the collision diameter is calculated with the cog velocity relative velocity and the dimensions of the ships velocity and cog are derived from the resultant of the time rate of change of the position vector the change of the position vector depends not only on the ship s trust but also on the external forces such as the wind and the water current thus a ship does not always travel in the direction of the bow and the cog and the hdg of the ship deviates from each other this deviation is not considered in equation 2 when alignment of the collision diameter and the projection of the ship dimensions are further discussed a problem is observed in pedersen s 1995 collision diameter calculation according to fig 3 pedersen s 1995 collision diameter uses cog value for projecting the ship dimensions however in the physically correct form hdg value must be used for projecting ship dimensions based on the discussion fig 3 can be corrected as in fig 4 the main difference between figs 3 and 4 is the usage of hdg instead of cog for the projection angle in the next section the needed steps and the modification for handling the cog and hdg difference is executed 3 3 the proposed collision diameter according to discussion given in section 3 2 cog should be used for determining the collision diameter line alignment and the difference between hdg and cog should be taken into account while projecting the ship dimensions the physical contact case for drifting ships is shown fig 5 the main difference between figs 2 and 5 is that cog and hdg of the ships are different due to the drifting motion and the ship dimensions are projected using the hdg of the ships for ith and jth ships the difference between hdg and cog is shown with δ i and δ j respectively and they can be calculated as 13 δ i hd g i co g i 14 δ j hd g j co g j the deviations δ i and δ j are shown on the projection of the ship sizes on to the collision diameter line to account for drifting the β and α values in equation 12 should be modified for the new d i j these adjustments are calculated according to the approach side of the subject ship if the subject ship is approaching from port a positive δ i value increases the β angle and a positive δ j decreases the α angle therefore the β and the α angles should be modified as given in equations 15 and 16 15 β y β δ i 16 α y α δ j if the subject ship is approaching from starboard a positive δ i value decreases β angle and a positive δ j increases the α angle therefore the β and the α angles should be modified as given in equations 17 and 18 17 β y β δ i 18 α y α δ j finally the modified collision diameter which also accounts for the drifting of the ships is given in equation 19 19 d ij y l i sin α y l j sin β y b i cos β y b j cos α y the novelty of the proposed collision diameter lies in the usage of hdg and cog in the same equation which combines these parameters to account for the external forces according to the proposed collision diameter as the difference between hdgi and or hdgj and the relative velocity direction decreases the projection of the ship dimension decreases as a result the collision diameter decreases 3 4 application for the encounter probability for finding the encounter probability of a waterway the methodology altan and otay 2018 is used the advantage of this model it can evaluate the encounter probability spatially for dynamic ship motion rather than using static pre determined routes therefore it can represent the difference of collision diameters without being restricted by the routes for the spatial approach the waterway has to be divided into sectors which are further divided into cells as represented in fig 6 a and b respectively fig 6 a represents 13 sectors whereas fig 6 b represents 484 cell centers that are used in the soi in fig 6 b extra cells outside the boundaries are observed these cells are placed for the local traffic eastbound and westbound between the boundaries of the sectors and the coast the local traffic is extrapolated from the traffic data that is collected at sector boundaries east and west the required maritime traffic data is determined using long term ais data for the analysis 1 5 billion ais messages in nmea format are parsed and stored in mssql the messages are analyzed via in house developed queries further details of the analysis and the navigational characteristics of the soi can be found in altan and otay 2017 the encounter probability formula applied at each cell is given in equation 20 as discussed in detail in altan and otay 2018 20 p e s i j ik s jk s ρ i ik s s ρ j jk s s v ij s d ij s δ l ik s δ l jk s t where s represents the sector i j the boundaries n s e w of the sector i n s e w j i w i k j k the cell inside the sector according to the entrance d i j collision diameter δ l travel distance t considered time in equation 20 i and j represent the boundaries and the travel direction of the ships therefore the head on over taking and crossing collisions are calculated by summing over i and j table 1 shows the traffic and the matrix of the encounter types equation 20 gives the encounter probability of each cell resulting with values between 0 and 1 since the variation of parameters among the cells makes equation 20 inherently probabilistic an extra probability function is not necessary 4 results and discussion in this section the encounter probability results with the proposed collision diameter is given for the soi the results are compared to the original collision diameter approach first the deviations in the collision diameters are presented in fig 7 the effect of the proposed collision diameter to the encounter probabilities are discussed separately for each sector fig 7 shows the deviations of the collision diameters along the strait of istanbul according to the encounter type of the ships in fig 7 the variations take higher values in the central sectors which contain most of the maneuver points during these maneuvers the effect of cross current increases the highest increase and decrease are observed in the n e encounter in sector 9 and in the s s encounter in sector 6 respectively although s s encounter is normally expected as a take over due to the maneuvering of ships in sector 6 it is observed as a crossing encounter the new collision diameter shows a large decrease 57 0 due to the deviation between the hdg and the cog of the ships table 2 displays the maximum and minimum variations between the collision diameters which are represented in fig 7 in addition to the maximum and minimum changes average and absolute average changes are given according to the encounter types according to table 2 the maximum changes are observed twice in sector 7 and the minimum changes are observed twice in sector 8 and 12 since the cross current cross wind and the maneuver of the ships are responsible for the difference between cog and hdg maximum improvement is observed in these sectors the fact that changes in the collision diameter are more significant in consecutive sectors 7 and 8 support the improvement by the proposed collision diameter if the collision diameter changes are averaged for the soi the maximum increase is observed in n e collision type and the maximum decrease is observed in n n collision type also for the absolute average variation n n collision type shows the maximum change and it is followed by n e collision table 3 shows the variation of the encounter probability with collision diameter the encounter probabilities include all of the types that are given in table 1 the results per sector are normalized in order to eliminate the effect of sector size values are ordered according to the variation in the encounter probabilities positive and negative signs represent the increase and decrease at the encounter probability with the usage of proposed collision diameter respectively the highest increase is observed in sector 12 and the highest decrease is observed in sector 8 the interesting outcome of table 3 is that 10 out of 13 sectors indicate a change of less than 1 the reason for this nearly insignificant change in the encounter probabilities in these sectors is that the drifting of the ships can change the collision diameter in both ways if there is an increase in one encounter type in the same sector it is compensated with a decrease in the opposite encounter type since the traffic density is nearly equal in northbound southbound and eastbound westbound directions the change of the encounter probability in these sectors is nearly zero therefore such a variation in the collision diameters is an indication of the drifting effect 5 conclusion in this study a novel collision diameter is presented the missing parts of the classical collision diameter are discussed and needed improvements are explained the application of the proposed collision diameter is executed for the strait of istanbul the main contribution of the proposed collision diameter is the ability to take into account the drifting of the ships and calculating the actual collision diameter the modifications are achieved by using the difference between the cog and the hdg of the ships the new collision diameters can increase up to 71 and decrease down to 57 although maximum deviation in the collision diameter change is observed in crossing collisions deviations in head on and take over encounters are also significant since nearly each increase in one type of encounter probability is compensated with the opposite direction s encounter probability decrease the overall encounter probability change in the soi can be insignificant nevertheless this does not mean that the contribution of the proposed collision diameter is insignificant on the contrary the encounter probabilities of some collision types have displayed a drastic change since the encounter probability in a given sector is the sum of all encounter types the increases in the collision diameters are compensated with the decreases in the opposite direction encounters knowing this outcome when drifting is observed special care should be given to the encounter probabilities and their types the traffic scheme can be re adjusted for the less encounter probability directions thus the safety of the waterway can be increased as a future study the proposed collision diameter can be applied to ship motion data which is clustered with respect to the navigational conditions also the evasive maneuver can be modelled with the bayesian network and the collision probability of the area can be calculated 
22601,in the maritime literature collision diameter is the distance between the ship centers for physical contact the collision diameter as described in the literature neglects the drifting of the ship from its course external forces such as the cross wind and or cross current may cause drifting of the ship which can be observed as a differentiation between course over ground cog and heading hdg in this study a detailed discussion of maritime encounters based on molecular collision theory and the lacking points at the existing approaches are discussed calculations are modified to obtain a more realistic collision diameter the novelty of the developed collision diameter is the usage of hdg and cog in the collision diameter equation which accounts for the drifting due to external forces the developed collision diameter is applied to the strait of istanbul where fluctuating water currents are continuously affecting the ships during their navigation the results are compared with the classical collision diameter approach the variation in the collision diameter values compared to the standard approach reaches up to 71 maximum improvement is observed in the crossing collisions whereas the head on and take over collisions are also affected due to relative drifting of the ships keywords collision diameter maritime risk maritime accident probability maritime traffic automatic identification system strait of istanbul 1 introduction quantifying the maritime collision probability is an important step towards mitigating the overall collision risk of the waterway gracat friis hansen and simonsen 2002 iwrap friis hansen 2008 samson degré et al 2003 are few of the tools dedicated to the quantification of for accident risk all of these tools that are reviewed in detail by pedersen 2010 depend on the pioneering quantification models developed by fujii and shiobara 1971 and macduff 1974 their models use equation 1 1 p coll p g p caus where p c o l l is the probability of

calculating the encounter probability in addition to these two approaches montewka et al 2010 used minimum distance to collision mdtc for calculating the distance between the vessels is not enough to perform efficient anti collision maneuvers and quantifying the vessel collision probability collision diameter approach which is the main focus of this study considers the physical contact of the ships and is based on molecular collision theory in the original theory the number of molecular collisions in a specific volume is given as the product of collision cross section density and the relative velocity of the molecules the theory depends on three assumptions all particles have linear trajectories through the observed space all particles have spherical shapes only two particles are involved in one collision when molecular collision theory is adapted to the maritime accident probability calculations the assumptions are modified as all ship paths are straight lines through the observed area all ships have rectangular shapes only two ships are involved in the collision in the scope of this paper a new collision diameter is developed based on the modification discussion outcomes the proposed formula accounts for the drifting of ships due to the cross current and cross wind and calculates the physically correct collision diameter the remaining part of the paper is structured as the following in section 2 the problem definition and evolution of the collision diameter concept in the literature are given the proposed collision diameter methodology is discussed in section 3 section 4 discusses the results including a comparison of the proposed collision diameter with the classical collision diameter by applying both to the strait of istanbul in the conclusion section findings are summarized and critically discussed along with the contributions achieved 2 problem definition 2 1 collision diameter foundations of a large number of geometric collision models in the literature are based on the molecular collision theory the theory states that if two randomly moving particle centers are within a certain distance there will be a collision this specific distance is called the collision diameter knowing the collision condition the number of collisions can be calculated via collision diameter trajectory density and the velocity of the particles as the theory is adopted to maritime accidents some modifications are applied ships are assumed to be navigating blindly similar to the random motion of molecules the control and or ability of the captain technical problems and the environmental effects are considered in the causation probability part the actual collision probability can be calculated as a product of encounter and causation probabilities in this study the focus will be on the encounter probability of the vessels the pioneering study of fujii and shiobara 1971 use the molecular collision theory for calculating the number of collisions in japanese waters in their study ship densities are found from radar images or from traffic volumes whereas ship velocities are rough estimations for three types of collisions head on take over and crossing collision diameter is calculated the number of accidents for the observed time is formulated pedersen 1995 improved the fujii and shiobara 1971 approach by introducing a general formula for the collision diameter according to the study the collision diameter is a function of ship dimensions loa and beam velocities and meeting angles of the encountering ships the collision diameter is discussed with trigonometric functions and drawings by friis hansen 2008 at his detailed study for iwrap explained with trigonometric functions and drawings the collision diameter can be defined as the maximum possible length of the projection of ship dimensions on to a line which is perpendicular to relative velocity of the ships at the contact condition when these studies and other studies that are using the same approach are researched and compared with the collision diameter definition the parameter that is used for the projection of the ship dimensions is used wrongly this problem can result from two reasons the problem during the adaptation of the molecular collision theory to maritime collisions the insufficient data in molecular collision theory all particles are assumed spheres that means that the particle is symmetrical from every angle heading and travel direction of the particle can also be called as course over ground are always the same however ships are more rectangular rather than spherical the ship has a bow and the heading of the ship points forward in the direction of the bow but the ship s travel direction which is represented as the course over ground is not always the same as the bow direction in the presence of a drifting motion course over ground cog deviates from its heading hdg this deviation varies the projection angle of the ship onto the collision diameter line as a result the collision diameter varies with the drifting motion with the introduction of automatic identification system ais the information available to the maritime traffic has increased databases are used to analyze and understand navigational patterns along the waterways aarsæther and moan 2009 altan and otay 2017 breithaupt et al 2017 shu et al 2017 wu et al 2017 xiao et al 2015 zhanghao et al 2010 these databases contain static and dynamic information regarding the navigation of the vessels dynamic data contains the hdg and cog values of the ships during their voyage as the dynamic datasets are further investigated the drifting motion of the ships are frequently observed gao et al 2017 shu et al 2017 in ship motions around the world considering these two facts described above this paper attempts to account for the drifting motion of the ships on collision diameter to the best of author s knowledge silveira et al 2014 is the only study which uses a collision diameter similar that is described in this study in silveira et al 2014 study the ship dimensions have been projected on the collision diameter line and the number of collision probabilities have been calculated however in their study the calculation reasoning and details are not discussed the main added values of present study can be listed as the reasoning of the collision diameter the calculation step descriptions the comparison of the collision diameter results in a real waterway where drifting of ships is clearly observed 2 2 strait of istanbul as a test case strait of istanbul soi is one of the most complicated waterways of the world in terms of navigation there are three major reasons for its complication first the transit traffic has to navigate through a local traffic which is eight times denser than the transit traffic altan and otay 2017 the transit traffic and local traffic routes intersect within a crossing manner during the navigation the second reason is the continuous maneuvering of the ships these maneuvers can reach up to 80 at certain parts of the soi besides these maneuvers have to be executed in a narrow waterway where the average width is 0 8 nm in addition the ships have to deal with strong currents in the soi which is the third reason for its complication the main cause of the surface currents in the soi is the elevation difference between water levels in the black sea and the marmara sea however which makes the surface current more complex is the lower layer current due to salinity difference between the marmara sea and the black sea özsoy et al 1996 due to the complexity of the flow regime the surface currents are continuously changing these surface currents can cause drifting motions especially between rumeli kavağı and üsküdar where the maneuvers and cross currents intensify the transit traffic in the soi is regulated by the vessel traffic system vts with a traffic separation scheme tss as given in fig 1 the transit ships are obligated to use the right hand side of the waterway the local ships ferries scheduled and unscheduled passenger ships have to keep clear from the transit traffic and they should spend minimum time inside the transit traffic zone the speed limit for the ships is 10 knots and unless it is necessary ships should strictly observe the speed limit if there is a ship inside the soi with a loa bigger than 200 m vts operators may switch to unidirectional traffic instead of bidirectional traffic when unidirectional traffic is used transit ships are allowed to use both lanes of the tss in addition to these rules it is recommended to use pilot services but officially it is not enforced 3 methodology in this section a new collision diameter is developed with the following the steps definition of the collision diameter discussion of the variables and missing aspects development of the proposed collision diameter application of the proposed collision diameter 3 1 the definition of collision diameter according to pedersen 1995 the collision diameter can be calculated as in equation 2 2 d ij l i v j l j v i v ij sin θ b j 1 sin θ v i v ij 2 1 2 b i 1 sin θ v j v ij 2 1 2 where d i j is the collision diameter of the ships navigating at ith and jth waterway l is the length of the ship b is the width of the ship v i is the velocity of the ith ship v j is the velocity of the jth ship v i j is the relative velocity of the ith and jth ships θ is the angle between the velocity vectors in equation 2 length width and velocity of the ships are direct inputs meeting angle and relative velocity of the ships are calculated from cog also the meeting angle of the ships determines the meeting type take over meeting θ 0 10 crossing meeting 10 θ 170 head on meeting θ 180 10 if the ships are on take over or head on meeting the meeting angle θ in equation 2 is assumed as 0 or 180 respectively and the collision diameter is equal to the sum of the widths of the two ships for crossing meetings equation 2 can be applied with the given θ value the trigonometric representation of the collision diameter is given by detailed drawing of friis hansen 2008 in fig 2 as shown in the figure d ij is the projection of the ship dimensions onto collision diameter line and the velocities v i v j and the relative velocity v i j of the ships create a triangle by using the law of sines the relation between the velocity vectors can be written as 3 sin θ v ij sin β v j sin α v i considering fig 2 and equation 3 the angles θ β α can be re written with the application of pythagorean trigonometric identity as 4 θ co g i co g j 5 β arcsin v j sin θ v ij 6 α arcsin v i sin θ v ij first term on the right hand side of equation 2 can be re written with the help of equations 4 6 as 7 l i v j l j v i v ij sin θ l i sin β l j sin α the equivalent of equation 7 as presented in fig 2 is 8 l i sin β l j sin α d 1 d 3 d 5 the second and the third terms on the right hand side of equation 2 can be re written using equations 4 6 as 9 b i 1 sin θ v j v ij 2 1 2 b i cos β 10 b j 1 sin θ v i v ij 2 1 2 b j cos α the equivalent sum of equations 9 and 10 is represented in fig 2 as 11 b j cos α b i cos β d 2 d 4 from equations 8 and 11 the collision diameter d i j can be re written as in equation 12 which is an alternative form of pedersen s original formula of equation 2 12 d ij l i sin α l j sin β b i cos β b j cos α equation 12 will be later developed for drifting angles in section 3 3 this form is preferred over equation 2 because it is clearer in its term of geometric projections 3 2 discussion of the variables according to the collision diameter definition given in section 2 1 the overall calculation methodology of the pedersen s 1995 collision diameter calculation can be schematized as in fig 3 fig 3 indicates alignment of collision diameter and vector projection of the ship dimensions as the two important parameters collision diameter alignment is perpendicular to relative velocity of the ships since the relative velocity is calculated according to velocity and cog of the ships collision diameter alignment also depends on these two parameters the length of the collision diameter is the vector projection of the ship dimension on to the collision diameter alignment since the ship by itself is assumed as the vector that will be projected on the collision diameter line ship s bow stern alignment is the direction of the projected vector in equation 2 the alignment and the length of the collision diameter is calculated with the cog velocity relative velocity and the dimensions of the ships velocity and cog are derived from the resultant of the time rate of change of the position vector the change of the position vector depends not only on the ship s trust but also on the external forces such as the wind and the water current thus a ship does not always travel in the direction of the bow and the cog and the hdg of the ship deviates from each other this deviation is not considered in equation 2 when alignment of the collision diameter and the projection of the ship dimensions are further discussed a problem is observed in pedersen s 1995 collision diameter calculation according to fig 3 pedersen s 1995 collision diameter uses cog value for projecting the ship dimensions however in the physically correct form hdg value must be used for projecting ship dimensions based on the discussion fig 3 can be corrected as in fig 4 the main difference between figs 3 and 4 is the usage of hdg instead of cog for the projection angle in the next section the needed steps and the modification for handling the cog and hdg difference is executed 3 3 the proposed collision diameter according to discussion given in section 3 2 cog should be used for determining the collision diameter line alignment and the difference between hdg and cog should be taken into account while projecting the ship dimensions the physical contact case for drifting ships is shown fig 5 the main difference between figs 2 and 5 is that cog and hdg of the ships are different due to the drifting motion and the ship dimensions are projected using the hdg of the ships for ith and jth ships the difference between hdg and cog is shown with δ i and δ j respectively and they can be calculated as 13 δ i hd g i co g i 14 δ j hd g j co g j the deviations δ i and δ j are shown on the projection of the ship sizes on to the collision diameter line to account for drifting the β and α values in equation 12 should be modified for the new d i j these adjustments are calculated according to the approach side of the subject ship if the subject ship is approaching from port a positive δ i value increases the β angle and a positive δ j decreases the α angle therefore the β and the α angles should be modified as given in equations 15 and 16 15 β y β δ i 16 α y α δ j if the subject ship is approaching from starboard a positive δ i value decreases β angle and a positive δ j increases the α angle therefore the β and the α angles should be modified as given in equations 17 and 18 17 β y β δ i 18 α y α δ j finally the modified collision diameter which also accounts for the drifting of the ships is given in equation 19 19 d ij y l i sin α y l j sin β y b i cos β y b j cos α y the novelty of the proposed collision diameter lies in the usage of hdg and cog in the same equation which combines these parameters to account for the external forces according to the proposed collision diameter as the difference between hdgi and or hdgj and the relative velocity direction decreases the projection of the ship dimension decreases as a result the collision diameter decreases 3 4 application for the encounter probability for finding the encounter probability of a waterway the methodology altan and otay 2018 is used the advantage of this model it can evaluate the encounter probability spatially for dynamic ship motion rather than using static pre determined routes therefore it can represent the difference of collision diameters without being restricted by the routes for the spatial approach the waterway has to be divided into sectors which are further divided into cells as represented in fig 6 a and b respectively fig 6 a represents 13 sectors whereas fig 6 b represents 484 cell centers that are used in the soi in fig 6 b extra cells outside the boundaries are observed these cells are placed for the local traffic eastbound and westbound between the boundaries of the sectors and the coast the local traffic is extrapolated from the traffic data that is collected at sector boundaries east and west the required maritime traffic data is determined using long term ais data for the analysis 1 5 billion ais messages in nmea format are parsed and stored in mssql the messages are analyzed via in house developed queries further details of the analysis and the navigational characteristics of the soi can be found in altan and otay 2017 the encounter probability formula applied at each cell is given in equation 20 as discussed in detail in altan and otay 2018 20 p e s i j ik s jk s ρ i ik s s ρ j jk s s v ij s d ij s δ l ik s δ l jk s t where s represents the sector i j the boundaries n s e w of the sector i n s e w j i w i k j k the cell inside the sector according to the entrance d i j collision diameter δ l travel distance t considered time in equation 20 i and j represent the boundaries and the travel direction of the ships therefore the head on over taking and crossing collisions are calculated by summing over i and j table 1 shows the traffic and the matrix of the encounter types equation 20 gives the encounter probability of each cell resulting with values between 0 and 1 since the variation of parameters among the cells makes equation 20 inherently probabilistic an extra probability function is not necessary 4 results and discussion in this section the encounter probability results with the proposed collision diameter is given for the soi the results are compared to the original collision diameter approach first the deviations in the collision diameters are presented in fig 7 the effect of the proposed collision diameter to the encounter probabilities are discussed separately for each sector fig 7 shows the deviations of the collision diameters along the strait of istanbul according to the encounter type of the ships in fig 7 the variations take higher values in the central sectors which contain most of the maneuver points during these maneuvers the effect of cross current increases the highest increase and decrease are observed in the n e encounter in sector 9 and in the s s encounter in sector 6 respectively although s s encounter is normally expected as a take over due to the maneuvering of ships in sector 6 it is observed as a crossing encounter the new collision diameter shows a large decrease 57 0 due to the deviation between the hdg and the cog of the ships table 2 displays the maximum and minimum variations between the collision diameters which are represented in fig 7 in addition to the maximum and minimum changes average and absolute average changes are given according to the encounter types according to table 2 the maximum changes are observed twice in sector 7 and the minimum changes are observed twice in sector 8 and 12 since the cross current cross wind and the maneuver of the ships are responsible for the difference between cog and hdg maximum improvement is observed in these sectors the fact that changes in the collision diameter are more significant in consecutive sectors 7 and 8 support the improvement by the proposed collision diameter if the collision diameter changes are averaged for the soi the maximum increase is observed in n e collision type and the maximum decrease is observed in n n collision type also for the absolute average variation n n collision type shows the maximum change and it is followed by n e collision table 3 shows the variation of the encounter probability with collision diameter the encounter probabilities include all of the types that are given in table 1 the results per sector are normalized in order to eliminate the effect of sector size values are ordered according to the variation in the encounter probabilities positive and negative signs represent the increase and decrease at the encounter probability with the usage of proposed collision diameter respectively the highest increase is observed in sector 12 and the highest decrease is observed in sector 8 the interesting outcome of table 3 is that 10 out of 13 sectors indicate a change of less than 1 the reason for this nearly insignificant change in the encounter probabilities in these sectors is that the drifting of the ships can change the collision diameter in both ways if there is an increase in one encounter type in the same sector it is compensated with a decrease in the opposite encounter type since the traffic density is nearly equal in northbound southbound and eastbound westbound directions the change of the encounter probability in these sectors is nearly zero therefore such a variation in the collision diameters is an indication of the drifting effect 5 conclusion in this study a novel collision diameter is presented the missing parts of the classical collision diameter are discussed and needed improvements are explained the application of the proposed collision diameter is executed for the strait of istanbul the main contribution of the proposed collision diameter is the ability to take into account the drifting of the ships and calculating the actual collision diameter the modifications are achieved by using the difference between the cog and the hdg of the ships the new collision diameters can increase up to 71 and decrease down to 57 although maximum deviation in the collision diameter change is observed in crossing collisions deviations in head on and take over encounters are also significant since nearly each increase in one type of encounter probability is compensated with the opposite direction s encounter probability decrease the overall encounter probability change in the soi can be insignificant nevertheless this does not mean that the contribution of the proposed collision diameter is insignificant on the contrary the encounter probabilities of some collision types have displayed a drastic change since the encounter probability in a given sector is the sum of all encounter types the increases in the collision diameters are compensated with the decreases in the opposite direction encounters knowing this outcome when drifting is observed special care should be given to the encounter probabilities and their types the traffic scheme can be re adjusted for the less encounter probability directions thus the safety of the waterway can be increased as a future study the proposed collision diameter can be applied to ship motion data which is clustered with respect to the navigational conditions also the evasive maneuver can be modelled with the bayesian network and the collision probability of the area can be calculated 
22602,a well tested mathematical model is used to bring out important counter intuitive results on the aspect of reducing tsunami impact forces on on shore buildings using sea dikes the mathematical model is based on numerical solution of the general reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with sst k ω model for turbulence closure tsunami waves are allowed to propagate on a 1 in 40 sloped beach and over top a sea dike before impacting on buildings the combined effect of various parameters such as position of the dike and shape and size of the dike has been studied for sloping beaches a sea dike placed far from the building may increase the tsunami impact force if its size is not appropriate it is found that a sea dike positioned close to the building offers best protection only if the height of the wave is small if the wave height is large there is an optimal distance at which the dike should be located for minimizing the tsunami impact force placing a second sea dike in addition to an existing sea dike may not reduce the tsunami impact force if the location and size of the sea dikes are not appropriate keywords tsunami wave impact sea dikes sea dike position rans model vof 1 introduction tsunamis the giant waves induced by tectonic action cause displacement of huge volumes of water from offshore to inland they cause serious damage to the life and coastal property at different levels depending on their characteristics namely wave amplitude and run up inundation velocity and inundation flow depth yalciner et al 2011 damages to the building can be classified as i withstood no damages except windows ii partially damaged columns withstood but walls broken and iii fully damaged both columns and pillars broken matsutomi et al 2006 coastal settlement in the v zone asce 2010 and buildings at lower elevation less than wave height of 100 year return period are highly vulnerable to risk and demand a suitable protection scheme to lessen the level of damage rong 2012 coastal defense measures such as seawalls and coastal plantations are some of the widely used strategies adapted in the recent decades for protection from tsunamis the overtopping and damages which occurred on two lines of 10 m sea walls in taro coast in miyagi prefectures during 2011 japan tsunami yalciner et al 2011 indicate the importance of optimal design of seawalls for reducing the impact of tsunami waves as the tsunami wave propagates mechanisms by which it dissipates its wave energy are i attenuation of wave height ii shoaling on a sloped beach iii impinging on a structure such as a seawall iv reflection due to structures v overtopping and v further inland inundation many researchers studied different aspects of seawalls and suggested modifications vertical seawalls have been investigated for their reflection efficiency by kirkgöz and mamak 2004 besley et al 2005 anand and sundar 2010a b cho et al 2017 and ning et al 2017 inclined sea walls which can dissipate much of wave energy through shoaling have been studied by müller and whittaker 1993 and eslami and eslami 2018 effectiveness of alterations in the seaward frontal shape of the seawall has been studied by murakami et al 1996 anand and sundar 2010a b sundar and anand 2010 de chowdhury et al 2017 impervious sea walls troch et al 2002 hsiao and lin 2010 del jesus et al 2012 pervious seawalls mallayachari and sundar 1994 koraim et al 2014 yueh et al 2016 and serrated or slotted type sea walls ahmed and schlenkhoff 2014 nassar et al 2018 have also been studied in detail alteration in the seawall by inclusion of recurves to control the overtopping of waves was studied by pearson et al 2004 schoonees 2014 and ravindar et al 2017 some studies even focused on the efficacy of a smaller seawall oshnack et al 2009 and of finite length thomas and cox 2012 effect of position of seawall was studied by nurhasanah et al 2014 the inherent shoaling property of the curved seawall attracted wide field usage in recent decades hsiao and lin 2010 experimentally and numerically investigated the impinging and overtopping effects of trapezoidal seawall located on a 1 in 40 sloped beach however they considered only a solitary wave and the focus was not on how a seawall can reduce the tsunami wave impact on structures run up studies on curved seawalls with various types of waves namely regular cnoidal and random waves inferred that galveston seawall gs increase the wave run up by 55 percent and 45 percent for random and cnoidal waves respectively as compared to the vertical wall scenario anand and sundar 2010a anand and sundar 2010b studied the interaction of random waves experimentally with the curved seawalls and found that flaring shaped seawall fss can dissipate more pressures than vertical wall by 35 percent anand et al 2011 conducted a detailed hydrodynamic study on the effect of crest of seawall on regular waves with four different frontal curvature shapes and inferred that fss type seawall and circular cum parabolic seawall cps are effective in bringing down the crest elevation owing to their recurve nature however the galveston seawall is not effective in terms of reflecting the wave back towards sea and hence increases the run up considerably these conclusions have been verified by de chowdhury et al 2017 for the case of regular monochromatic waves using ansys fluent and sph models all of the above studies pertain to the effect of curved front of the seawall on the run up but not on the impact on buildings located on the downstream of the seawall also they considered different types of waves regular cnoidal random solitary but not tsunami wave van de lindt et al 2009 experimentally studied the tsunami wave load deformation of a model residential building it was inferred that the orientation of the building with the wave attack has significant effect on the impact force and also the response of the building may not induce the same force internally on the structure nouri et al 2010 explored experimentally the hydrodynamic interaction of tsunami waves with square and circular free standing structures and found that for a 1 m impoundment depth the maximum pressure location on the structure is 40 percent of the bore height herein the effect of sloped beach was not studied chinnarasri et al 2013 experimentally studied the interaction of tsunami bore with square rectangular and octagonal building models and with varying degrees of opening in the building it was found that the octagonal shaped buildings reduce the force acting on them by 20 percent as compared to that of a square shaped building a reduction in wave force of 10 30 percent and 40 60 percent is achieved for a building opening of 25 and 50 percent respectively interaction of tsunami waves of various strengths with one storey and two storey onshore building models on penang island was investigated experimentally by moon et al 2014 and pressure force relationship was established meyyappan et al 2015 studied experimentally the design of a tsunami resistant composite structure and found that irrespective of the orientation of the building the maximum impact force acts on the floor level of the building in all the above studies the effect of a coastal structure such as a sea dike on impact force reduction has not been studied recently nurhasanah et al 2014 conducted laboratory experiments to study how the impact on a building can be mitigated by positioning a seawall at different locations the laboratory experiments considered a vertical wall located in front of a building on a flat surface and found that closer the wall to the building greater the protection they also found that force reduction on building is a function of the ratio between seawall height and the building height rahman et al 2014 conducted similar laboratory studies for differentiating the effects of continuous and intermittent seawalls they inferred that the seawall height position and type of seawall influence the reduction of force on the building both the studies neglected the effect of sloping beach and their studies are not representative of actual coast condition foster et al 2017 developed an empirical equation for estimating the inundation velocities of tsunami wave interacting with rectangular structures it was found experimentally that for longer periods the unsteady tsunami wave can be approximated as a gradually varied flow in this study the structures were located close to the sea and the effect of foreshore was not considered also the above experiments used dam break wave which does not represent the tsunami wave conditions completely particularly when the reservoir size is finite in a seminal study crespo et al 2007 conducted numerical simulations using 3d smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph model to demonstrate how a dike can mitigate the force on downstream structures in terms of the dike height and the distance between the dike and the structure they carried out experiments with a rectangular dike in a numerical flume with horizontal base also the distance between the point where the wave got generated and location of the dike was constant these do not depict the realistic field situations pertaining to sea dikes on sloping beaches recently yang et al 2018 studied the mitigation of tsunami force on the rear house by a front house they employed the ansys fluent finite volume code to perform 3d numerical simulations there is no over topping of the rectangular shaped front house also numerical simulations were carried out in a numerical flume with a horizontal base the literature review has revealed that although several studies have been carried out in the past on protection of on shore structures from tsunami wave impact using sea dikes the combined effect of various parameters such as position of the dike and shape and size of the dike has not been studied in detail either experimentally or numerically especially for sloping beaches also to the authors knowledge the efficacy of cascading of dikes on a sloped beach on the tsunami impact on the on shore buildings has not been explored in this study a well tested mathematical model is used to bring out important counter intuitive results on the aspect of reducing tsunami impact forces on on shore buildings using sea dikes the propagation impinging and overtopping of tsunami bore with constant wave height and wave velocity over a trapezoidal sea dike on a 1 in 40 sloped beach is studied the study primarily focuses on the application of sea dike for protecting onshore structures from extreme wave conditions such as tsunamis the study brings out the combined effect of sea dike height and the position on the tsunami impact force for different wave conditions the study also considers the effect of cascading of sea dikes or sea dikes in tandem as a cost effective substitute for one single large sea dike a total of 26 numerical simulations are performed using a commercially available computational fluid dynamics cfd solver following sections discuss the validation of the code details of numerical simulations and the results obtained in the numerical simulations results presented in this paper are expected to aid in the optimal design of tsunami protection structures 2 materials and methods in this study the cfd solver fluent is used for performing numerical simulations the cfd solver was first validated using the physical model experimental data for the case of dam break flows available in the literature ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 the solver was then used for performing the numerical simulations for protection of onshore buildings by the sea dike these cases for validation of the cfd solver are chosen because although the wave created by the dam break is not the same as a tsunami wave there are many common features such as a moving shock front on a still water propagation of a wave with infinite wave length and interaction of wave with a trapezoidal obstacle this is especially true in the initial stages of dam break wave movement 2 1 mathematical model it has been well established that rans equations with appropriate turbulence closure models are well suited for solving complex free surface flow problems and have been used in the past for simulating tsunami flows crespo et al 2007 yang et al 2018 two dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations eq 1 and 2 are numerically solved in the cfd solver fluent 1 ρ t x i

which are modeled using the shear stress transport k ω sst k ω turbulence closure model although many turbulence models are available for the closure of rans equations sst k ω is preferred for its blending effect of both k ε which is efficient in far field prediction of transport quantities and k ω model for its prediction in the near wall since the present problem demands the predictions of water depth at the building and the interaction of tsunami wave in the vicinity of the dike sst k ω would be an appropriate turbulence closure model the upper bound of eddy viscosity is limited by forcing the turbulent shear stress to be bounded by a constant times turbulent kinetic energy this prevents the unrealistic built up of turbulence in the stagnation region the eddy viscosity at the free stream is zero ideally however the present solver takes a minimum value the eddy viscosity at the walls is taken to be zero the above can be achieved through the absolute vorticity and the blending functions hence it is able to calculate transport of principal shear stresses and accurately calculate the flow during adverse pressure gradient sst k ω predicts the free surface flows fairly well in the regions of separation of flow particularly as the wave overtops the dike equations 3 and 4 are the transport equation for turbulent quantities such as turbulent kinetic energy k and

available software package is employed to solve this 2d problem this package uses a finite volume method to solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes shear stress transport sst k ω model by menter 1994 is employed for the turbulence closure a number of rigorous simulations have been made with the other existing turbulence models such as k ε k ω with its variants for the test cases considered for validation of fluent it was found that numerical results obtained using sst k ω model matched better with the free surface deformation in the experiments as compared to those obtained using other turbulence closure models this is especially true for wave interaction with obstacles among the various options available to track the interface in a multiphase flow problem volume of fluid vof by hirt and nichols 1981 was used for tracking the free surface deformation of the air water interface zhan et al 2016 have successfully used the vof method for flows with air entrainment such as those occurring on stepped spillways equation 19 is the continuity of volume fraction of water and air the interface is traced using a piece wise linear approach where the interface within each cell is assumed to have a linear slope for the calculation of advection of fluid through the cell face in equation 19 when α 0 the cell is empty while when α 1 the cell is full of water α 0 5 indicates that the cell has the air water interface free surface at the upstream and downstream are calculated from the pressure inlet and pressure outlet condition respectively the free surface level and flow velocities are specified as input for the pressure inlet and pressure outlet boundary conditions an open channel feature in the fluent code is enabled for this purpose the numerical simulation results presented in this paper are expected to represent real physical phenomena as we have solved the complete set of reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with appropriate turbulent closure model and vof technique for surface tracking the effect of air entrainment on the free surface evolution and impact force and the phenomenon of shoaling come out as part of the solution several earlier studies have successfully used rans equations with turbulent closure models for simulating tsunami waves crespo et al 2007 yang et al 2018 2 2 model validation a typical dam break flow is chosen to validate the fluent code the experimental work of ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 on the initial stages of dam break flow is numerically simulated using the fluent solver ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 used a 9 m long horizontal channel with a rectangular cross section 0 30 m wide and 0 34 m high the impoundment extended from 0 m to 4 65 m from the channel entrance the initial water depth in the reservoir was 0 25 m an instantaneously removable gate at 4 65 m was lifted to create the dam break wave three different scenarios of downstream water depth i dry bed ii depth 0 025 m and iii depth 0 1 m were considered free surface profiles during initial stages of dam break were reported for each of these cases for the numerical simulations a two dimensional domain 0 3 m 9 m is constructed wherein 4 65 m 0 25 m represents the reservoir behind the dam as shown in fig 1 the left and right boundaries are specified as wall boundary conditions with no flow the top boundary is specified as symmetric with zero normal flow across the boundary the bottom boundary condition is solid boundary with no slip the numerically simulated free surface elevations of the dam break wave are compared with the experimental data for the cases of i dry downstream bed ii wet downstream bed with depth 0 1 and iii wet downstream bed with depth 0 4 in figs 2 4 respectively it can be observed from figs 2 4 that the numerically simulated evolution of water surface profile of the dam break wave matches satisfactorily with the measured data it is especially so for distance travelled by the wave and the strength of the wave front in case of wet bed conditions the fluent code was also validated using the experimental data for dam break flows in the presence of an obstacle ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 these experiments were also conducted in the same facility as used by ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 earlier except that a trapezoidal shaped obstacle was placed in the downstream channel the numerically simulated free surface elevations of the dam break wave impacting on a trapezoidal obstacle are compared with the experimental data in fig 5 it can be observed from fig 5 that the numerically simulated evolution of water surface profile of the dam break wave matches satisfactorily with the measured data it is especially so for the increased flow depth due to presence of obstacle the validation of the numerical model has been carried out using only the temporally varying water surface i e wave profile data the direct validation using pressure data was not carried out although that is of prime interest in the present work however it may be noted that the pressure is related to water surface level if the evolution of water surface level is determined satisfactorily it is expected that the simulation of other flow parameters would also be satisfactory the temporal evolution of water surface level has been simulated well even when an obstacle is present and even after the impact fig 5 this indicates that the impact forces on the obstacle have been simulated satisfactorily these results indicate that the fluent solver can be employed for conducting numerical simulations to study the movement of tsunami wave and its impact on structures 3 numerical simulations 3 1 cases studied in this work the cfd model is used for studying the effectiveness of a sea dike on reducing the impact of a tsunami induced wave on on shore buildings the two dimensional model is used for studying the effect of an infinitely long sea dike running parallel to a long row of closely spaced buildings on the coast such as those found in some coastal cities eg pondicherry india in these numerical simulations the tsunami wave is generated as a constant bore of height h on a still water depth d it propagates over a 1 in 40 sloped beach before it impacts on a building as shown in fig 6 four different cases for sea dike positions are considered as shown in fig 6 at a distance of l 1 4 m 3 m 2 m and 1 m from the building the case of no sea dike is also considered the effects of sea dike height h d 0 1 m 0 15 m and 0 20 m and seaward slope of the dike 1 3 1 2 1 1 on the impact on the downstream building are examined in this study the effect of positioning two shorter sea dikes in tandem on the impact on the building is also analyzed as a possible substitute for a taller sea dike the impact corresponding to three different wave conditions as described in table 1 is studied the flow is simulated for 18 s for all the cases the interest is to consider the wave phenomenon such as inundation of tsunami wave before impinging the sea dike impinging and overtopping of the dike further overland inundation before impacting the building and back propagation of wave after reflection from the building the simulation time of 18 s is chosen such that all these above phenomenon are captured within this time beyond this period the effect is only due to submergence and not impact the impact forces on the building are analyzed for various scenarios description of numerical simulations is summarized in table 2 3 2 numerical domain the overall length and height of the numerical domain are 16 3 m and 0 6 m respectively fig 7 the total length of the beach is subdivided as flat beach 0 7 m and sloped beach 7 15 m the height of the building is 0 3 m the shape of the sea dike is trapezoidal the slope of the seaward face of the sea dike is 1 in 3 and that facing landward is 1 in 1 for a sea dike height of 0 1 m the sea bed and the beach are assumed to be impermeable and smooth a uniform rectangular mesh size of 0 01 m is chosen throughout the domain with 11 2 298 elements the grid is chosen based on grid independence tests the geometry of the problem is chosen so as to represent near realistic condition for a 1 50 scale the height of the building is 15 m while the horizontal length of the sloped beach is 400 m 3 3 wave generation tsunami waves in both experimental and numerical studies have been generated by different means in the past some researchers generated tsunami wave as a sudden displacement of water by dropping a heavy object in a water tank thusyanthan and madabhusi 2008 thusyanthan and martinez 2008 in some studies ramsden 1996 hsiao and lin 2010 jiang et al 2017 tsunami wave was assumed as a single wave solitary wave generated through a single forward stroke of piston paddle wave maker although a dam break wave may not exactly simulate actual tsunami conditions they have been successfully used by researchers in their recent studies on tsunami inundations and impact on the structures both experimentally nouri et al 2010 chinnarasri et al 2013 nurhasanah et al 2014 rahman et al 2014 meyyappan et al 2015 and numerically crespo et al 2007 del jesus et al 2012 yang et al 2018 because dam break waves have several hydrodynamic similarities chanson et al 2003 chanson 2005 2006 with tsunami waves the main drawback of the dam break wave to simulate a tsunami wave arises due to the finite size of the reservoir behind the dam the reflected rarefaction wave from the finite size reservoir makes it difficult to preserve the sharp wave front and also reduces the wave height as the wave propagates downstream this drawback of dam break wave is overcome in the present work by imposing a shock wave condition at the upstream boundary as discussed in the following section 3 4 initial and boundary conditions tsunami wave propagates inland like a moving wall hence a wave of constant wave height h and wave velocity v w is generated by appropriate specification of initial and boundary conditions in the numerical simulations in the present method the initial and sea side boundary conditions are set to ensure that shape of the wave front and wave velocity are preserved the simulated wave propagation has important tsunami wave features such as sharp front long wave length and preservation of the wave height as it propagates on the horizontal sea bed as shown in fig 7 the left and right most boundaries are taken as pressure inlet and pressure outlet boundary where the pressure head is assigned in terms of water depth this is achieved by enabling the open channel flow condition in the vof model of fluent the celerity of a wave for a given wave height is found by the equations for a shock as given below chaudhry 2008 20 v 1 v 2 2 g y 1 y 2 2 y 1 y 2 y 1 2 y 2 2 21 v w v 2 y 2 v 1 y 1 y 2 y 1 where v 1 flow velocity ahead of the shock v 2 flow velocity behind the shock y 1 flow depth ahead

the wave height the flow velocity v 2 can be determined using eq 20 this value of v 2 is specified as the velocity corresponding to the wave height assigned to the left boundary as the flow is considered from left to right the downstream velocity at the outlet boundary is assigned as zero as the flow does not reach this point during the simulation period the top and bottom the flat seabed the sloped beach the trapezoidal sea dike the building inland boundaries are considered as impermeable walls with no slip condition throughout the simulation the flow equations are solved under atmospheric pressure as operating condition three different wave conditions w c 1 w c 2 and w c 3 as given in table 1 wave strength used in the numerical simulations are considered the still water depth is 0 1 m for all the three wave conditions fig 7 at time t 0 s the still water extends between x 2 m to x 11 m in the domain volume fraction of water is equal to 1 0 for all the cells between x 0 to x 2 m and y 0 to y 0 25 m or 0 20 or 0 15 m for w c 3 w c 2 w c 1 respectively in these cells flow velocity is 1 24 m s 1 05 m s and 0 86 m s corresponding to w c 3 w c 2 and w c 1 respectively volume fraction of water is equal to 1 0 for all the cells between x 2 m to x 11 m and y 0 to y 0 1 m fig 7 flow velocity in these cells is equal to zero the volume fraction of water and flow velocity in all the other cells are equal to zero at time t 0 s 3 5 wave propagation the propagation of the numerically simulated tsunami wave is shown in fig 8for the case of w c 3 and the sea dike located at 3 m distance from the building it can be seen from fig 8 a and fig 8b that the numerically simulated water depth at x 3 m and x 6 m is constant at 0 25 m once the wave has arrived at these locations and gone past however there is an increase in wave height at 9 m fig 8c due to shoaling it can be observed that various wave phenomenon such as offshore wave propagation fig 8a and b the shoaling of wave on the sloped beach fig 8c its breaking on the slope fig 8d impinging and overtopping of wave on the sea dike fig 8e inland inundation by tsunami wave fig 8f and its impact on the downstream building fig 8g are satisfactorily simulated in the numerical simulations 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of location of sea dike on the wave impact on the building the position of sea dike may have a significant influence on the impact force on the downstream building due to tsunami wave numerical simulations are carried out to evaluate this effect and the results for temporal variation in the impact force on the building for low medium and high strength wave conditions are shown in figs 9 11 respectively it can be observed from fig 9 that in the case of low strength wave w c 1 the sea dike reduces the impact force on the building significantly in comparison to the case of no sea dike irrespective of its position the best protection is provided when the sea dike is close to the building the maximum impact force reduced from 83 n for the case of no sea dike to 15 n for the case of sea dike located at 1 0 m ahead of the building however results are significantly different for the case of high strength wave w c 3 fig 11 for high wave strength sea dike positioned far away from the building increases the potential head immediately upstream of the sea dike and enables the inundated wave to move downstream with higher velocities hence for cases with relatively higher wave magnitudes such as w c 3 and w c 2 the presence of sea dike far away from building enables the wave to reach the building faster than that for the case of no sea dike figs 10 and 11 it can also be observed from fig 11 for high strength wave that the maximum impact force irrespective of its position is marginally more than that for the case of no sea dike however over a long period of time sea dike located at 3 m ahead of the building reduces the impact forces more than the other cases including the case of no sea dike the effect of sea dike location on the time of arrival of the wave at the building is very clear also from fig 10 for the case of medium strength wave it can be observed from fig 9 through 11 that the protection offered by the sea dike depends not only on the strength of the wave but also on the location of the sea dike closer the sea dike to the building higher is the available crest free board r c for the inundated volume of water to be accumulated ahead of the sea dike as shown in fig 6 4 2 effect of sea dike height it is obvious from the discussion in section 4 1 that a sea dike with a height of 0 1 m is not able to reduce the maximum initial impact force on the building irrespective of where it is located in the case of high strength wave therefore the effect of sea dike height on the wave impact force on the building is studied by conducting numerical simulations for three sea dike heights 0 1 m 0 15 m and 0 2 m for the specified position of the sea dike 3 m from the building the height of the dike is varied without any change on the gradient in which the wave ascends and descends the sea dike as shown in fig 12 a wave of high strength w c 3 is considered in these numerical simulations and the impact on the building is analyzed results obtained from numerical simulations for the force on the downstream building are shown in fig 13 it can be clearly observed from fig 13 that the height of sea dike has significant effect on the magnitude of initial impact force the maximum impact force reduced from a value of approximately 410 n to 280 n also there is a substantial reduction in the impact force in the long term from a value of 300 n to 200 n numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the effect of positioning of the high sea dike h d 0 2 m on the wave impact force due to a high strength wave w c 3 for the cases where the effect of position of sea dike on wave impact run no 4 through run no 23 is analyzed the sea dike is assumed to have a fixed base width but the vertical height of the dike is varied in these runs the seaward and leeward slopes of the dike vary accordingly however for the cases where the effect of height of the sea dike on wave impact is analyzed run no 24 and run no 25 the base width of the dike is varied so as to have a fixed slope on the seaward and leeward face of the dike these results are presented in fig 14 it can be clearly observed from fig 14 that a sea dike located at 2 m distance results in the least impact force over a period of time although maximum impact force is equal to 215 n it lasts only for a short duration and reduces to an average value of 150 n the maximum impact force reaches up to 340 n when the sea dike is located at 4 0 m from the building and it also lasts longer as compared to the case when the dike is located at 2 0 m sea dike located close to the building 1 m from the building reduces the initial impact force significantly but gradually increases the impact force over a period of time to 350 n it can be observed from these results that the effect of sea dike on reduction of impact force on downstream building is highly non linear depending on i the height of sea dike ii wave strength and iii the location of sea dike this non linearity comes into the effect because of multiple reasons i there is dissipation of wave as it travels on the sloping dry beach before it reaches the dike ii dissipation of the wave as it impacts the sea dike and overtops it and iii dissipation of the wave as it moves in the region between the sea dike and building before it impacts on the building the dissipation of wave due to first reason obviously depends on the wave strength slope of the beach and the distance it has to travel before it reaches the sea dike i e the location of the sea dike the dissipation of the wave due to sea dike depends on i the wave strength just before it impacts on the sea dike i e the original wave strength and location of the sea dike and ii shape and size of the dike the dissipation of the wave due to last reason depends on i wave strength after the overtopping of the sea dike i e the original wave strength location of the sea dike size of the sea dike and shape of the sea dike and ii slope of the beach and distance between the sea dike and the building i e location the present numerical simulations have shown that for a specified design wave there is an optimal combination of sea dike height and sea dike location to significantly reduce the wave impact force on the downstream building 4 3 effect of seaward slope of the sea dike as the dissipation of wave energy is achieved by shoaling of waves on the inclined portion of the sea dike anand and sundar 2010a b numerical simulations are carried out with different slopes in these simulations the seaward slope of the sea dike is varied from 1in 1 to 1in 3 while the landward slope 1 in 1 remains unchanged the sea dike is located at 3 m distance from the building and its height is 0 15 m in the numerical simulations a wave of high strength w c 3 is considered it can be clearly observed from the numerical results fig 15 that the sea dike with a mild slope 1 in 3 reduces the wave impact significantly the maximum impact force reduces from 400 n for the case of 1 1 slope to 340 n for the case of 1 3 slope the long term average impact force reduces from 300 n to 225 n 5 discussion the non dimensional relation between the position of sea dike on the coast l 1 l and the maximum impact force on the downstream building f m a x ρ g h 2 for given wave conditions and dike height h d h can be deduced from the results of numerical simulations table 3 the non dimensional plots are presented in figs 16 and 17 here l 1 is the position of sea dike from the building h is the wave height h d is the height of the dike and f m a x is the maximum impact force on the building it is inferred from fig 16 that the wave impact is lower for low wave strength w c 1 and higher for relatively higher wave strengths w c 2 and w c 3 as can be expected for low wave strengths the sea dike should be located as close to the building as possible while the location had relatively no effect on the maximum impact force when the wave strength is strong the relation between the impact force on the building and the position of dike for a high strength wave w c 3 is compared across different dike heights fig 17 it is observed from fig 17 that taller dikes offer better mitigation compared to the shorter ones irrespective of their position l 1 l as can be expected for shorter dikes h d h 0 666 the location does not affect the maximum impact force significantly however for taller dikes the best location is given by l 1 l 0 5 it may be noted that construction of a tall dike for mitigation of tsunami impact forces on onshore buildings may spoil the beach aesthetics therefore the feasibility of reducing the impact forces using two shorter dikes was evaluated as an alternative cost effective and aesthetic solution two dikes in tandem arrangement are expected to better mitigate the impact force on the building because of change in hydrodynamics due to cascading effect numerical simulations with two sea dikes positioned in tandem are carried out for two cases i two short dikes h d 0 1 m and ii two tall dikes h d 0 2 m these simulations are carried out for impact force on the building due to a high strength wave w c 3 and the results are presented in fig 18 it can be observed from fig 18 that two dikes each of 0 1 m height positioned at 2 m and 4 m from the building result in significantly higher impact force 400 n than when a single dike of 0 2 m height is positioned at 2 m 200 n the crest free board r c is small when a sea dike of height 0 1 m is placed at 4 0 m distance from the building therefore there is no significant reduction in the impact force in addition to that caused by a sea dike of height 0 1 m located at l 1 2 m interestingly two dikes each 0 2 m height positioned at 2 m and 4 m from the building resulted in early arrival of the tsunami wave at the building although there is an overall reduction in the impact forces fig 18 the reduction in maximum impact force is negligible these simulations again indicate that appropriate positioning of sea dikes is crucial for reducing the impact forces on onshore buildings 6 summary and conclusions mitigation of tsunami impact forces on onshore buildings using sea dikes is investigated numerically first the 2d rans models in ansys fluent are validated successfully using the well established experimental results available in literature these numerical models are then employed to simulate the propagation of a tsunami wave on a sloped beach its impingement and run up over along trapezoidal shaped sea dike further inland propagation and its impact on a row of closely spaced buildings numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the effects of i position of sea dike on the beach ii the height of sea dike and iii the seaward slope of the dike on the wave impact force on the onshore buildings it is found from the study that maximum impact force on the onshore building is least when the dike is located close to the building when the ratio of wave height to dike height is low location of the dike does not affect the impact force on the building if the ratio of wave height to dike height is large however there exists an optimal position for dike which offers best mitigation for tsunamis of higher magnitude the tsunami impact force also depends on the seaward slope of the dike milder seaward slope offers best mitigation against tsunami impact force but result in extra cost also two dikes located in tandem in coastal space change the time evolution of impact forces on buildings due to change in hydrodynamics however the reduction in the maximum impact force is negligible acknowledgement authors thank department of

22602,a well tested mathematical model is used to bring out important counter intuitive results on the aspect of reducing tsunami impact forces on on shore buildings using sea dikes the mathematical model is based on numerical solution of the general reynolds averaged navier stokes equations with sst k ω model for turbulence closure tsunami waves are allowed to propagate on a 1 in 40 sloped beach and over top a sea dike before impacting on buildings the combined effect of various parameters such as position of the dike and shape and size of the dike has been studied for sloping beaches a sea dike placed far from the building may increase the tsunami impact force if its size is not appropriate it is found that a sea dike positioned close to the building offers best protection only if the height of the wave is small if the wave height is large there is an optimal distance at which the dike should be located for minimizing the tsunami impact force placing a second sea dike in addition to an existing sea dike may not reduce the tsunami impact force if the location and size of the sea dikes are not appropriate keywords tsunami wave impact sea dikes sea dike position rans model vof 1 introduction tsunamis the giant waves induced by tectonic action cause displacement of huge volumes of water from offshore to inland they cause serious damage to the life and coastal property at different levels depending on their characteristics namely wave amplitude and run up inundation velocity and inundation flow depth yalciner et al 2011 damages to the building can be classified as i withstood no damages except windows ii partially damaged columns withstood but walls broken and iii fully damaged both columns and pillars broken matsutomi et al 2006 coastal settlement in the v zone asce 2010 and buildings at lower elevation less than wave height of 100 year return period are highly vulnerable to risk and demand a suitable protection scheme to lessen the level of damage rong 2012 coastal defense measures such as seawalls and coastal plantations are some of the widely used strategies adapted in the recent decades for protection from tsunamis the overtopping and damages which occurred on two lines of 10 m sea walls in taro coast in miyagi prefectures during 2011 japan tsunami yalciner et al 2011 indicate the importance of optimal design of seawalls for reducing the impact of tsunami waves as the tsunami wave propagates mechanisms by which it dissipates its wave energy are i attenuation of wave height ii shoaling on a sloped beach iii impinging on a structure such as a

investigated for their reflection efficiency by kirkgöz and mamak 2004 besley et al 2005 anand and sundar 2010a b cho et al 2017 and ning et al 2017 inclined sea walls which can dissipate much of wave energy through shoaling have been studied by müller and whittaker 1993 and eslami and eslami 2018 effectiveness of alterations in the seaward frontal shape of the seawall has been studied by murakami

sundar 1994 koraim et al 2014 yueh et al 2016 and serrated or slotted type sea walls ahmed and schlenkhoff 2014 nassar et al 2018 have also been studied in detail alteration in the seawall by inclusion of recurves to control the overtopping of waves was studied by pearson et al 2004 schoonees 2014 and ravindar et al 2017 some studies even focused on the efficacy of a smaller seawall oshnack et al 2009 and of finite length thomas and cox 2012 effect of position of seawall was studied by nurhasanah et al 2014 the inherent shoaling property of the curved seawall attracted wide field usage in recent decades hsiao and lin 2010 experimentally and numerically investigated the impinging and overtopping effects of trapezoidal seawall located on a 1 in 40 sloped beach however they considered only a solitary wave and the focus was not on how a seawall can reduce the tsunami wave impact on structures run up studies on curved seawalls with various types of waves namely regular cnoidal and random waves inferred that galveston seawall gs increase the wave run up by 55 percent and 45 percent for random and cnoidal waves respectively as compared to the vertical wall scenario anand and sundar 2010a anand and sundar 2010b studied the interaction of random waves experimentally with the curved seawalls and found that flaring shaped seawall fss can dissipate more pressures than vertical wall by 35 percent anand et al 2011 conducted a detailed hydrodynamic study on the effect of crest of seawall on regular waves with four different frontal curvature shapes and inferred that fss type seawall and circular cum parabolic seawall cps are effective in bringing down the crest elevation owing to their recurve nature however the galveston seawall is not effective in terms of reflecting the wave back towards sea and hence increases the run up considerably these conclusions have been verified by de chowdhury et al 2017 for the case of regular monochromatic waves using ansys fluent and sph models all of the above studies pertain to the effect of curved front of the seawall on the run up but not on the impact on buildings located on the downstream of the seawall also they considered different types of waves regular cnoidal random solitary but not tsunami wave van de lindt et al 2009 experimentally studied the tsunami wave load deformation of a model residential building it was inferred that the orientation of the building with the wave attack has significant effect on the impact force and also the response of the building may not induce the same force internally on the structure nouri et al 2010 explored experimentally the hydrodynamic interaction of tsunami waves with square and circular free standing structures and found that for a 1 m impoundment depth the maximum pressure location on the structure is 40 percent of the bore height herein the effect of sloped beach was not studied chinnarasri et al 2013 experimentally studied the interaction of tsunami bore with square rectangular and octagonal building models and with varying degrees of opening in the building it was found that the octagonal shaped buildings reduce the force acting on them by 20 percent as compared to that of a square shaped building a reduction in wave force of 10 30 percent and 40 60 percent is achieved for a building opening of 25 and 50 percent respectively interaction of tsunami waves of various strengths with one storey and two storey onshore building models on penang island was investigated experimentally by moon et al 2014 and pressure force relationship was established meyyappan et al 2015 studied experimentally the design of a tsunami resistant composite structure and found that irrespective of the orientation of the building the maximum impact force acts on the floor level of the building in all the above studies the effect of a coastal structure such as a sea dike on impact force reduction has not been studied recently nurhasanah et al 2014 conducted laboratory experiments to study how the impact on a building can be mitigated by positioning a seawall at different locations the laboratory experiments considered a vertical wall located in front of a building on a flat surface and found that closer the wall to the building greater the protection they also found that force reduction on building is a function of the ratio between seawall height and the building height rahman et al 2014 conducted similar laboratory studies for differentiating the effects of continuous and intermittent seawalls they inferred that the seawall height position and type of seawall influence the reduction of force on the building both the studies neglected the effect of sloping beach and their studies are not representative of actual coast condition foster et al 2017 developed an empirical equation for estimating the inundation velocities of tsunami wave interacting with rectangular structures it was found experimentally that for longer periods the unsteady tsunami wave can be approximated as a gradually varied flow in this study the structures were located close to the sea and the effect of foreshore was not considered also the above experiments used dam break wave which does not represent the tsunami wave conditions completely particularly when the reservoir size is finite in a seminal study crespo et al 2007 conducted numerical simulations using 3d smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph model to demonstrate how a dike can mitigate the force on downstream structures in terms of the dike height and the distance between the dike and the structure they carried out experiments with a rectangular dike in a numerical flume with horizontal base also the distance between the point where the wave got generated and location of the dike was constant these do not depict the realistic field situations pertaining to sea dikes on sloping beaches recently yang et al 2018 studied the mitigation of tsunami force on the rear house by a front house they employed the ansys fluent finite volume code to perform 3d numerical simulations there is no over topping of the rectangular shaped front house also numerical simulations were carried out in a numerical flume with a horizontal base the literature review has revealed that although several studies have been carried out in the past on protection of on shore structures from tsunami wave impact using sea dikes the combined effect of various parameters such as position of the dike and shape and size of the dike has not been studied in detail either experimentally or numerically especially for sloping beaches also to the authors knowledge the efficacy of cascading of dikes on a sloped beach on the tsunami impact on the on shore buildings has not been explored in this study a well tested mathematical model is used to bring out important counter intuitive results on the aspect of reducing tsunami impact forces on on shore buildings using sea dikes the propagation impinging and overtopping of tsunami bore with constant wave height and wave velocity over a trapezoidal sea dike on a 1 in 40 sloped beach is studied the study primarily focuses on the application of sea dike for protecting onshore structures from extreme wave conditions such as tsunamis the study brings out the combined effect of sea dike height and the position on the tsunami impact force for different wave conditions the study also considers the effect of cascading of sea dikes or sea dikes in tandem as a cost effective substitute for one single large sea dike a total of 26 numerical simulations are performed using a commercially available computational fluid dynamics cfd solver following sections discuss the validation of the code details of numerical simulations and the results obtained in the numerical simulations results presented in this paper are expected to aid in the optimal design of tsunami protection structures 2 materials and methods in this study the cfd solver fluent is used for performing numerical simulations the cfd solver was first validated using the physical model experimental data for the case of dam break flows available in the literature ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 the solver was then used for performing the numerical simulations for protection of onshore buildings by the sea dike these cases for validation of the cfd solver are chosen because although the wave created by the dam break is not the same as a tsunami wave there are many common features such as a moving shock front on a still water propagation of a wave with infinite wave length and interaction of wave with a trapezoidal obstacle this is especially true in the initial stages of dam break wave movement 2 1 mathematical model it has been well established that rans equations with appropriate turbulence closure models are well suited for solving complex free surface flow problems and have been used in the past for simulating tsunami flows crespo et al 2007 yang et al 2018 two dimensional reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations eq 1 and 2 are numerically solved in the cfd solver fluent 1 ρ t x i

which are modeled using the shear stress transport k ω sst k ω turbulence closure model although many turbulence models are available for the closure of rans equations sst k ω is preferred for its blending effect of both k ε which is efficient in far field prediction of transport quantities and k ω model for its prediction in the near wall since the present problem demands the predictions of water depth at the building and the interaction of tsunami wave in the vicinity of the dike sst k ω would be an appropriate turbulence closure model the upper bound of eddy viscosity is limited by forcing the turbulent shear stress to be bounded by a constant times turbulent kinetic energy this prevents the unrealistic built up of turbulence in the stagnation region the eddy viscosity at the free stream is zero ideally however the present solver takes a minimum value the eddy viscosity at the walls is taken to be zero the above can be achieved through the absolute vorticity and the blending functions hence it is able to calculate transport of principal shear stresses and accurately calculate the flow during adverse pressure gradient sst k ω predicts the free surface flows fairly well in the regions of separation of flow particularly as the wave overtops the dike equations 3 and 4 are the transport equation for turbulent quantities such as turbulent kinetic energy k and

available software package is employed to solve this 2d problem this package uses a finite volume method to solve the reynolds averaged navier stokes shear stress transport sst k ω model by menter 1994 is employed for the turbulence closure a number of rigorous simulations have been made with the other existing turbulence models such as k ε k ω with its variants for the test cases considered for validation of fluent it was found that numerical results obtained using sst k ω model matched better with the free surface deformation in the experiments as compared to those obtained using other turbulence closure models this is especially true for wave interaction with obstacles among the various options available to track the interface in a multiphase flow problem volume of fluid vof by hirt and nichols 1981 was used for tracking the free surface deformation of the air water interface zhan et al 2016 have successfully used the vof method for flows with air entrainment such as those occurring on stepped spillways equation 19 is the continuity of volume fraction of water and air the interface is traced using a piece wise linear approach where the interface within each cell is assumed to have a linear slope for the calculation of advection of fluid through the cell face in equation 19 when α 0 the cell is empty while when α 1 the cell is full of water α 0 5 indicates that the cell has the air water interface free surface at the upstream and downstream are calculated from the pressure inlet and pressure outlet condition respectively the free surface level and flow velocities are specified as input for the pressure inlet and pressure outlet boundary conditions an open channel feature in the fluent code is enabled for this purpose the numerical simulation results presented in this paper are expected to represent real physical phenomena as we have solved the complete set of reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with appropriate turbulent closure model and vof technique for surface tracking the effect of air entrainment on the free surface evolution and impact force and the phenomenon of shoaling come out as part of the solution several earlier studies have successfully used rans equations with turbulent closure models for simulating tsunami waves crespo et al 2007 yang et al 2018 2 2 model validation a typical dam break flow is chosen to validate the fluent code the experimental work of ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 on the initial stages of dam break flow is numerically simulated using the fluent solver ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 used a 9 m long horizontal channel with a rectangular cross section 0 30 m wide and 0 34 m high the impoundment extended from 0 m to 4 65 m from the channel entrance the initial water depth in the reservoir was 0 25 m an instantaneously removable gate at 4 65 m was lifted to create the dam break wave three different scenarios of downstream water depth i dry bed ii depth 0 025 m and iii depth 0 1 m were considered free surface profiles during initial stages of dam break were reported for each of these cases for the numerical simulations a two dimensional domain 0 3 m 9 m is constructed wherein 4 65 m 0 25 m represents the reservoir behind the dam as shown in fig 1 the left and right boundaries are specified as wall boundary conditions with no flow the top boundary is specified as symmetric with zero normal flow across the boundary the bottom boundary condition is solid boundary with no slip the numerically simulated free surface elevations of the dam break wave are compared with the experimental data for the cases of i dry downstream bed ii wet downstream bed with depth 0 1 and iii wet downstream bed with depth 0 4 in figs 2 4 respectively it can be observed from figs 2 4 that the numerically simulated evolution of water surface profile of the dam break wave matches satisfactorily with the measured data it is especially so for distance travelled by the wave and the strength of the wave front in case of wet bed conditions the fluent code was also validated using the experimental data for dam break flows in the presence of an obstacle ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 these experiments were also conducted in the same facility as used by ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 earlier except that a trapezoidal shaped obstacle was placed in the downstream channel the numerically simulated free surface elevations of the dam break wave impacting on a trapezoidal obstacle are compared with the experimental data in fig 5 it can be observed from fig 5 that the numerically simulated evolution of water surface profile of the dam break wave matches satisfactorily with the measured data it is especially so for the increased flow depth due to presence of obstacle the validation of the numerical model has been carried out using only the temporally varying water surface i e wave profile data the direct validation using pressure data was not carried out although that is of prime interest in the present work however it may be noted that the pressure is related to water surface level if the evolution of water surface level is determined satisfactorily it is expected that the simulation of other flow parameters would also be satisfactory the temporal evolution of water surface level has been simulated well even when an obstacle is present and even after the impact fig 5 this indicates that the impact forces on the obstacle have been simulated satisfactorily these results indicate that the fluent solver can be employed for conducting numerical simulations to study the movement of tsunami wave and its impact on structures 3 numerical simulations 3 1 cases studied in this work the cfd model is used for studying the effectiveness of a sea dike on reducing the impact of a tsunami induced wave on on shore buildings the two dimensional model is used for studying the effect of an infinitely long sea dike running parallel to a long row of closely spaced buildings on the coast such as those found in some coastal cities eg pondicherry india in these numerical simulations the tsunami wave is generated as a constant bore of height h on a still water depth d it propagates over a 1 in 40 sloped beach before it impacts on a building as shown in fig 6 four different cases for sea dike positions are considered as shown in fig 6 at a distance of l 1 4 m 3 m 2 m and 1 m from the building the case of no sea dike is also considered the effects of sea dike height h d 0 1 m 0 15 m and 0 20 m and seaward slope of the dike 1 3 1 2 1 1 on the impact on the downstream building are examined in this study the effect of positioning two shorter sea dikes in tandem on the impact on the building is also analyzed as a possible substitute for a taller sea dike the impact corresponding to three different wave conditions as described in table 1 is studied the flow is simulated for 18 s for all the cases the interest is to consider the wave phenomenon such as inundation of tsunami wave before impinging the sea dike impinging and overtopping of the dike further overland inundation before impacting the building and back propagation of wave after reflection from the building the simulation time of 18 s is chosen such that all these above phenomenon are captured within this time beyond this period the effect is only due to submergence and not impact the impact forces on the building are analyzed for various scenarios description of numerical simulations is summarized in table 2 3 2 numerical domain the overall length and height of the numerical domain are 16 3 m and 0 6 m respectively fig 7 the total length of the beach is subdivided as flat beach 0 7 m and sloped beach 7 15 m the height of the building is 0 3 m the shape of the sea dike is trapezoidal the slope of the seaward face of the sea dike is 1 in 3 and that facing landward is 1 in 1 for a sea dike height of 0 1 m the sea bed and the beach are assumed to be impermeable and smooth a uniform rectangular mesh size of 0 01 m is chosen throughout the domain with 11 2 298 elements the grid is chosen based on grid independence tests the geometry of the problem is chosen so as to represent near realistic condition for a 1 50 scale the height of the building is 15 m while the horizontal length of the sloped beach is 400 m 3 3 wave generation tsunami waves in both experimental and numerical studies have been generated by different means in the past some researchers generated tsunami wave as a sudden displacement of water by dropping a heavy object in a water tank thusyanthan and madabhusi 2008 thusyanthan and martinez 2008 in some studies ramsden 1996 hsiao and lin 2010 jiang et al 2017 tsunami wave was assumed as a single wave solitary wave generated through a single forward stroke of piston paddle wave maker although a dam break wave may not exactly simulate actual tsunami conditions they have been successfully used by researchers in their recent studies on tsunami inundations and impact on the structures both experimentally nouri et al 2010 chinnarasri et al 2013 nurhasanah et al 2014 rahman et al 2014 meyyappan et al 2015 and numerically crespo et al 2007 del jesus et al 2012 yang et al 2018 because dam break waves have several hydrodynamic similarities chanson et al 2003 chanson 2005 2006 with tsunami waves the main drawback of the dam break wave to simulate a tsunami wave arises due to the finite size of the reservoir behind the dam the reflected rarefaction wave from the finite size reservoir makes it difficult to preserve the sharp wave front and also reduces the wave height as the wave propagates downstream this drawback of dam break wave is overcome in the present work by imposing a shock wave condition at the upstream boundary as discussed in the following section 3 4 initial and boundary conditions tsunami wave propagates inland like a moving wall hence a wave of constant wave height h and wave velocity v w is generated by appropriate specification of initial and boundary conditions in the numerical simulations in the present method the initial and sea side boundary conditions are set to ensure that shape of the wave front and wave velocity are preserved the simulated wave propagation has important tsunami wave features such as sharp front long wave length and preservation of the wave height as it propagates on the horizontal sea bed as shown in fig 7 the left and right most boundaries are taken as pressure inlet and pressure outlet boundary where the pressure head is assigned in terms of water depth this is achieved by enabling the open channel flow condition in the vof model of fluent the celerity of a wave for a given wave height is found by the equations for a shock as given below chaudhry 2008 20 v 1 v 2 2 g y 1 y 2 2 y 1 y 2 y 1 2 y 2 2 21 v w v 2 y 2 v 1 y 1 y 2 y 1 where v 1 flow velocity ahead of the shock v 2 flow velocity behind the shock y 1 flow depth ahead of the shock y 2 flow depth behind the shock v w propagation speed of the shock and g acceleration due to gravity in all the simulations y 1 0 1 m and v 1 0 0 m s for a specified value of y 2 y 1 i e the wave height the flow velocity v 2 can be determined using eq 20 this value of v 2 is specified as the velocity corresponding to the wave height assigned to the left boundary as the flow is considered from left to right the downstream velocity at the outlet boundary is assigned as zero as the flow does not reach this point during the simulation period the top and bottom the flat seabed the sloped beach the trapezoidal sea dike the building inland boundaries are considered as impermeable walls with no slip condition throughout the simulation the flow equations are solved under atmospheric pressure as operating condition three different wave conditions w c 1 w c 2 and w c 3 as given in table 1 wave strength used in the numerical simulations are considered the still water depth is 0 1 m for all the three wave conditions fig 7 at time t 0 s the still water extends between x 2 m to x 11 m in the domain volume fraction of water is equal to 1 0 for all the cells between x 0 to x 2 m and y 0 to y 0 25 m or 0 20 or 0 15 m for w c 3 w c 2 w c 1 respectively in these cells flow velocity is 1 24 m s 1 05 m s and 0 86 m s corresponding to w c 3 w c 2 and w c 1 respectively volume fraction of water is equal to 1 0 for all the cells between x 2 m to x 11 m and y 0 to y 0 1 m fig 7 flow velocity in these cells is equal to zero the volume fraction of water and flow velocity in all the other cells are equal to zero at time t 0 s 3 5 wave propagation the propagation of the numerically simulated tsunami wave is shown in fig 8for the case of w c 3 and the sea dike located at 3 m distance from the building it can be seen from fig 8 a and fig 8b that the numerically simulated water depth at x 3 m and x 6 m is constant at 0 25 m once the wave has arrived at these locations and gone past however there is an increase in wave height at 9 m fig 8c due to shoaling it can be observed that various wave phenomenon such as offshore wave propagation fig 8a and b the shoaling of wave on the sloped beach fig 8c its breaking on the slope fig 8d impinging and overtopping of wave on the sea dike fig 8e inland inundation by tsunami wave fig 8f and its impact on the downstream building fig 8g are satisfactorily simulated in the numerical simulations 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of location of sea dike on the wave impact on the building the position of sea dike may have a significant influence on the impact force on the downstream building due to tsunami wave numerical simulations are carried out to evaluate this effect and the results for temporal variation in the impact force on the building for low medium and high strength wave conditions are shown in figs 9 11 respectively it can be observed from fig 9 that in the case of low strength wave w c 1 the sea dike reduces the impact force on the building significantly in comparison to the case of no sea dike irrespective of its position the best protection is provided when the sea dike is close to the building the maximum impact force reduced from 83 n for the case of no sea dike to 15 n for the case of sea dike located at 1 0 m ahead of the building however results are significantly different for the case of high strength wave w c 3 fig 11 for high wave strength sea dike positioned far away from the building increases the potential head immediately upstream of the sea dike and enables the inundated wave to move downstream with higher velocities hence for cases with relatively higher wave magnitudes such as w c 3 and w c 2 the presence of sea dike far away from building enables the wave to reach the building faster than that for the case of no sea dike figs 10 and 11 it can also be observed from fig 11 for high strength wave that the maximum impact force irrespective of its position is marginally more than that for the case of no sea dike however over a long period of time sea dike located at 3 m ahead of the building reduces the impact forces more than the other cases including the case of no sea dike the effect of sea dike location on the time of arrival of the wave at the building is very clear also from fig 10 for the case of medium strength wave it can be observed from fig 9 through 11 that the protection offered by the sea dike depends not only on the strength of the wave but also on the location of the sea dike closer the sea dike to the building higher is the available crest free board r c for the inundated volume of water to be accumulated ahead of the sea dike as shown in fig 6 4 2 effect of sea dike height it is obvious from the discussion in section 4 1 that a sea dike with a height of 0 1 m is not able to reduce the maximum initial impact force on the building irrespective of where it is located in the case of high strength wave therefore the effect of sea dike height on the wave impact force on the building is studied by conducting numerical simulations for three sea dike heights 0 1 m 0 15 m and 0 2 m for the specified position of the sea dike 3 m from the building the height of the dike is varied without any change on the gradient in which the wave ascends and descends the sea dike as shown in fig 12 a wave of high strength w c 3 is considered in these numerical simulations and the impact on the building is analyzed results obtained from numerical simulations for the force on the downstream building are shown in fig 13 it can be clearly observed from fig 13 that the height of sea dike has significant effect on the magnitude of initial impact force the maximum impact force reduced from a value of approximately 410 n to 280 n also there is a substantial reduction in the impact force in the long term from a value of 300 n to 200 n numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the effect of positioning of the high sea dike h d 0 2 m on the wave impact force due to a high strength wave w c 3 for the cases where the effect of position of sea dike on wave impact run no 4 through run no 23 is analyzed the sea dike is assumed to have a fixed base width but the vertical height of the dike is varied in these runs the seaward and leeward slopes of the dike vary accordingly however for the cases where the effect of height of the sea dike on wave impact is analyzed run no 24 and run no 25 the base width of the dike is varied so as to have a fixed slope on the seaward and leeward face of the dike these results are presented in fig 14 it can be clearly observed from fig 14 that a sea dike located at 2 m distance results in the least impact force over a period of time although maximum impact force is equal to 215 n it lasts only for a short duration and reduces to an average value of 150 n the maximum impact force reaches up to 340 n when the sea dike is located at 4 0 m from the building and it also lasts longer as compared to the case when the dike is located at 2 0 m sea dike located close to the building 1 m from the building reduces the initial impact force significantly but gradually increases the impact force over a period of time to 350 n it can be observed from these results that the effect of sea dike on reduction of impact force on downstream building is highly non linear depending on i the height of sea dike ii wave strength and iii the location of sea dike this non linearity comes into the effect because of multiple reasons i there is dissipation of wave as it travels on the sloping dry beach before it reaches the dike ii dissipation of the wave as it impacts the sea dike and overtops it and iii dissipation of the wave as it moves in the region between the sea dike and building before it impacts on the building the dissipation of wave due to first reason obviously depends on the wave strength slope of the beach and the distance it has to travel before it reaches the sea dike i e the location of the sea dike the dissipation of the wave due to sea dike depends on i the wave strength just before it impacts on the sea dike i e the original wave strength and location of the sea dike and ii shape and size of the dike the dissipation of the wave due to last reason depends on i wave strength after the overtopping of the sea dike i e the original wave strength location of the sea dike size of the sea dike and shape of the sea dike and ii slope of the beach and distance between the sea dike and the building i e location the present numerical simulations have shown that for a specified design wave there is an optimal combination of sea dike height and sea dike location to significantly reduce the wave impact force on the downstream building 4 3 effect of seaward slope of the sea dike as the dissipation of wave energy is achieved by shoaling of waves on the inclined portion of the sea dike anand and sundar 2010a b numerical simulations are carried out with different slopes in these simulations the seaward slope of the sea dike is varied from 1in 1 to 1in 3 while the landward slope 1 in 1 remains unchanged the sea dike is located at 3 m distance from the building and its height is 0 15 m in the numerical simulations a wave of high strength w c 3 is considered it can be clearly observed from the numerical results fig 15 that the sea dike with a mild slope 1 in 3 reduces the wave impact significantly the maximum impact force reduces from 400 n for the case of 1 1 slope to 340 n for the case of 1 3 slope the long term average impact force reduces from 300 n to 225 n 5 discussion the non dimensional relation between the position of sea dike on the coast l 1 l and the maximum impact force on the downstream building f m a x ρ g h 2 for given wave conditions and dike height h d h can be deduced from the results of numerical simulations table 3 the non dimensional plots are presented in figs 16 and 17 here l 1 is the position of sea dike from the building h is the wave height h d is the height of the dike and f m a x is the maximum impact force on the building it is inferred from fig 16 that the wave impact is lower for low wave strength w c 1 and higher for relatively higher wave strengths w c 2 and w c 3 as can be expected for low wave strengths the sea dike should be located as close to the building as possible while the location had relatively no effect on the maximum impact force when the wave strength is strong the relation between the impact force on the building and the position of dike for a high strength wave w c 3 is compared across different dike heights fig 17 it is observed from fig 17 that taller dikes offer better mitigation compared to the shorter ones irrespective of their position l 1 l as can be expected for shorter dikes h d h 0 666 the location does not affect the maximum impact force significantly however for taller dikes the best location is given by l 1 l 0 5 it may be noted that construction of a tall dike for mitigation of tsunami impact forces on onshore buildings may spoil the beach aesthetics therefore the feasibility of reducing the impact forces using two shorter dikes was evaluated as an alternative cost effective and aesthetic solution two dikes in tandem arrangement are expected to better mitigate the impact force on the building because of change in hydrodynamics due to cascading effect numerical simulations with two sea dikes positioned in tandem are carried out for two cases i two short dikes h d 0 1 m and ii two tall dikes h d 0 2 m these simulations are carried out for impact force on the building due to a high strength wave w c 3 and the results are presented in fig 18 it can be observed from fig 18 that two dikes each of 0 1 m height positioned at 2 m and 4 m from the building result in significantly higher impact force 400 n than when a single dike of 0 2 m height is positioned at 2 m 200 n the crest free board r c is small when a sea dike of height 0 1 m is placed at 4 0 m distance from the building therefore there is no significant reduction in the impact force in addition to that caused by a sea dike of height 0 1 m located at l 1 2 m interestingly two dikes each 0 2 m height positioned at 2 m and 4 m from the building resulted in early arrival of the tsunami wave at the building although there is an overall reduction in the impact forces fig 18 the reduction in maximum impact force is negligible these simulations again indicate that appropriate positioning of sea dikes is crucial for reducing the impact forces on onshore buildings 6 summary and conclusions mitigation of tsunami impact forces on onshore buildings using sea dikes is investigated numerically first the 2d rans models in ansys fluent are validated successfully using the well established experimental results available in literature these numerical models are then employed to simulate the propagation of a tsunami wave on a sloped beach its impingement and run up over along trapezoidal shaped sea dike further inland propagation and its impact on a row of closely spaced buildings numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the effects of i position of sea dike on the beach ii the height of sea dike and iii the seaward slope of the dike on the wave impact force on the onshore buildings it is found from the study that maximum impact force on the onshore building is least when the dike is located close to the building when the ratio of wave height to dike height is low location of the dike does not affect the impact force on the building if the ratio of wave height to dike height is large however there exists an optimal position for dike which offers best mitigation for tsunamis of higher magnitude the tsunami impact force also depends on the seaward slope of the dike milder seaward slope offers best mitigation against tsunami impact force but result in extra cost also two dikes located in tandem in coastal space change the time evolution of impact forces on buildings due to change in hydrodynamics however the reduction in the maximum impact force is negligible acknowledgement authors thank department of

22603,ocean crossing ship structures are continuously suffering from wave loads when sailing at sea the wave loads cause large variation of structural stresses leading to fatigue accumulation in ship structures for the fatigue life prediction of ship structures it is important to obtain both the long term distribution and the time history of wave induced loads an essential step is to get reliable wave statistics and accurate description of the stochastic nature of sea state along a ship s sailing routes during her service time generally the wave statistics are provided by the classification societies as a joint probability of significant wave height and mean wave period also known as wave scatter diagram in addition different statistical wave models have been developed to describe wave environments along arbitrary shipping routes based on different data sources e g hindcast data satellite measurements buoys etc in this paper two statistical wave models based on hindcast data and satellite wave measurements are briefly introduced and compared with the wave measurements carried out by onboard radar both of the wave models are then used to generate the wave environments along given shipping routes the effectiveness of the wave models is demonstrated by comparing the stochastic nature and the statistical characteristics of simulated sea state histories with those of the source oceanographic data finally an application of the wave model to the fatigue assessment is presented keywords significant wave height mean wave period spatio temporal wave model storm model wave statistics ship fatigue design 1 introduction with the vast development of shipbuilding technology and global shipping activities the size of constructed ships has been increased dramatically during the past decade in particular for container ships among various kinds of structural problem nowadays fatigue damage to the hull structure is one of the most serious problems to be challenged furthermore the complexities on the modern ship and the increasing demands for greater reliability efficiency and economy require a scientific powerful and versatile method for their structural design ships and marine structure encounter an infinite variety of wave loading conditions the wave loading applied on ships can cause continuously varying structural stresses which will result in fatigue damage accumulation in ship structures ship fatigue analysis often include large uncertainties fricke et al 2002 which may be caused by e g material properties treatment of redistribution of residual stresses the corrosion weld defects and wave load computations etc in particular large uncertainties are associated with the difference of the provided from actual wave environments encountered by a ship olsen et al 2005 mao 2010 mao et al 2013 etc these uncertainties may lead to fatigue cracks initiated much earlier than expected jordan and knight 1980 storhaug et al 2007 generally the wave statistics are provided by the classification society guidelines as a joint probability distribution of significant wave height and mean wave period also known as the wave scatter diagram the wave scatters reflect the long term distribution of waves encountered by all ships sailing at these specific areas therefore the actual wave environment encountered by individual ships may be not consistent with that provided by the classification societies guidelines that are unlikely to consider operational conditions for individual ships mao et al 2010 2012 in addition the wave scatters provided by different classification societies might differ even for the same ship fatigue design olsen et al 2005 in order to provide more realistic wave information for ship design and operation various sensors have been launched to collect wave data e g buoy data onboard observations satellite measurements and reanalysis data etc furthermore various statistical wave models have been developed to model wave environments along arbitrary shipping routes these wave models can be used to generate wave conditions encountered along a ship s actual sailing routes then that generated wave information can be taken as input for ship fatigue design and extreme loading predictions etc in this paper two statistical wave models one is based on wave scatter data extracted from reanalysis dataset along ship routes de gracia et al 2017 and the other is based on the spatio temporal correlation of wave from reanalysis and satellite measurements are briefly introduced in mao 2014 their capabilities to describe the statistical properties of wave conditions encountered by a specific ship are validated using the full scale measurement data which was collected in a 2800teu containership when sailing in the north atlantic during 2008 mao 2010 the stochastic nature and the statistical characteristics of sea states generated from the two wave models are compared with sea information extracted from oceanographic reanalysis database data actual onboard measurement and that provided by classification society guidelines for ship fatigue assessment furthermore a simplified ship structural detail is selected to demonstrate the application of these two models for actual fatigue assessment of ship structures based on the sea environments and stress histories generated by the two models both the conventional high cycle fatigue life prediction and crack propagation method are demonstrated and compared with the results obtained from measured stress in the same containership the following part of the paper is organized as follows to make the completeness of the paper section 2 briefly presents the basic information of the two statistical models the case study vessel and her collected wave information are presented in section 3 section 4 presents the comparison of long term wave statistics obtained from various sources as well as the pros and cons of these two wave models then section 5 presents the application studies for fatigue assessments of a simplified ship structural detail finally the conclusion is given in section 6 2 two wave generation models and ship stress generation for the initial design of marine structures e g ships offshore platforms offshore wind turbines etc it is essential to get accurate long term sea environmental data for their trade areas one conventional way is to use the so called wave scatter diagram provided by classification guidelines the scatter diagram can describe average wave statistics for all ships sailing in the specific region but it may differ from that encountered by individual ships in particular today s ships are equipped with various modern navigation systems such as weather routing voyage optimization systems etc which can help ships to sail in specific sea environments according to the ship s trade objectives mao et al 2012 mao 2014 it means that the actual encountered sea conditions can differ significantly from that provided by design guidelines leading to large uncertainties in ship design e g fatigue life and extreme loading predictions hence it is needed to develop models to describe the long term wave environments encountered by ships during their service life in this section two different statistical wave models developed at the authors research groups are briefly presented 2 1 the storm wave model the first generation storm model 1g storm model was proposed by tomita et al 1995 to emulate real random significant wave height time histories and examine fatigue crack growth behavior under random loading based on collected wave data of ships that sailed on the pacific ocean the model presumes that the wave oceanography phenomena is possible to divide mainly into two conditions calm sea and storm conditions as in fig 1 furthermore sailing in calm sea condition the encountered sea state history can be modeled as a time independent random process and in the storm condition the significant wave height increase over time and reaches a maximum value at one point only before decreasing gradually thus encountered significant wave height in a storm condition is a time dependent process these two conditions appear alternately in random order as in fig 1 kawabe 2002 proposed a modified version of the 1g storm model this model considered the correlation between significant wave height h s and mean wave periods t z by using the joint probability of h s and t z both of tomita and kawabe model is derived from a single wave scatter diagram by using a trial and error manner further the 3g storm model that apply automatic storm configuration consider the fluctuation of storm duration on the short sea history and generate equivalent sea state history from the data with various observation period was presented in prasetyo et al 2012 recently a more advanced storm model called 4g storm model has been developed de gracia et al 2017 for the realistic modeling of encountered wave conditions the 4g storm model considers the occurrence probability distribution of the wave direction to evaluate a ship s stress response it means that the change of relative heading angle during the sailing period can be simulated let hs avg be the h s for the whole ship life average hs ext is the maximum h s that occurs once in the whole ship s lifetime and hs max i is the maximum h s in i th storm class s i thus the storm is classified based on hs max i and its range between hs ext to hs avg first the generation of h s time history needs a storm profile configuration details can be found in prasetyo 2013 the storm profile is the sea state information consisting of the significant wave height sequence and the occurrence probability of storms with various maximum wave heights the storm profile is configured based on assumptions such as the ship s target design life is 25 years the duration of the storm is varied with 3 998 days average and 1 822 days deviation and is composed by the probability density of the storm p storm and calm sea p calm the probability density of the h s in a calm sea p calm h s the probability density of the i th storm class s i p storm i and the h s profile for each storm class n h s i the long term distribution of h s is assumed to follow the weibull distribution and joint probability distribution of the significant wave height h s and mean wave period t z is refitted by obeying the conditional of the lognormal distribution of t z given h s kawabe 2002 thus the parameters of the weibull distribution shape and scale parameters are identified from wave measurement along the ship routes the h s profile in a storm n h s i is determined based on the assumption that this profile is distributed by the following the tail of the weibull distribution the h s history in position p and at time t h s p t is modeled by using the storm profile configuration as described above the position p and the time t are related to the existing wave data point herein called point and season for the chosen point and season random h s is generated as follows decide between the calm and storm sea condition by random number selection considering the occurrence probability of storm seas and calm seas p calm and p storm for a calm sea condition a random sequence of h s is generated by obeying p calm h s for a storm sea condition decide the storm class by random number selection the variation of the duration of the storm d var is chosen so it fits the single normal distribution for the storm class s i generate a crescendo decrescendo sequence of h s according to eq 1 1 n h s d v a r i n h s i d v a r 3 5 once h s is determined the mean period t z is determined by random number selection using the conditional probability of t z given h s proposed in wan and shinkai 1995 as presented in eq 2 2 p t z h s exp ln t z μ 2 2 σ 2 α t z h s α t z h s 1 2 π t z σ μ e ln t z h s σ 2 var ln t z h s where p t z h s is the conditional probability density for t z given h s the joint probability distribution p h s t z is calculated by the following eq 3 3 p hs tz p hs p tz hs a sequence of the storm and calm sea conditions are generated by sampling with replacement fig 2 shows an example of a time history of significant wave height with variable storm duration generated by storm model simulation 2 2 the statistical spatio temporal wave model the variation of significant wave height h s is often described as the long term distribution of h s at some location or region the long term distribution can be interpreted as variability of h s at a randomly taken time during a year it is often fitted with a weibull distribution limiting time span to a specific time window such as january month will affect the h s distribution because the variability of h s depends on seasons by shrinking the time span to a single moment t and the geographical region to a location x y the distribution of h s t x y can be obtained this is the meaning of spatio temporal wave model distribution for significant wave height h s in this subsection according to the study in baxevani et al 2005 for a time period limited to a couple of weeks and regions of about 4 in diameter the significant wave height h s is log normal distributed i e ln h s t x y is normal distributed with mean m t x y and variance σ 2 x y at a fixed position denoted by p the temporal variability of the mean m p t is modeled by means of annual cycle 4 m p t β 0 β 1 cos ϕ t β 2 sin ϕ t ϕ 2 π 365 2 here the time t is measured in days and the parameters β 0 β 1 β 2 depend on geographical location p furthermore from a local perspective i e in a neighborhood of location p the spatial correlation between the logarithms of h s at q with the distance x y to p i e x y q p unit km could be sufficiently accurately described by 5 ρ p x y exp x 2 y 2 2 l p 2 where l p units km is regarded as the correlation length depends on the geographical location of the center p of the small region and with the month the random surface ln h s x y has a 2 dimensional spectrum 6 s p ω 1 ω 2 σ p 2 l p 2 2 π e l p 2 ω 1 2 ω 2 2 2 the local spatial field in a neighborhood of the geographical location p can be approximated by 7 ln h s x y δ ω s p ω i ω j r i j cos x ω i y ω j e i j where δ ω ω i 1 ω i r ij e ij are independent rayleigh and uniformly distributed variables respectively note that the model of β 0 β 1 β 2 l p and σ p 2 was fitted to the satellite topex poseidon data and that the geographical distance x y are in equivalent degrees so that degree in both longitude and latitude stands for the same distance when measured in kilometers see baxevani et al 2005 for north atlantic finally spatial models for the variability of the significant wave height on the world oceans can be accessed in baxevani et al 2008 an example of the median value is presented in fig 3 the parameters β σ 2 and the correlation lengths l has been estimated at 1861 different 4 4 degrees regions 2 2 1 local h s dynamics the variability of significant wave height in time and space has been studied in baxevani et al 2008 where a local spatio temporal ln h s t x y was proposed in this spatio temporal model a moving storm of median velocity v x v y is used to model drift of ln h s t x y the velocity was first introduced in longuet higgins 1957 more precisely in this spatio temporal model the dynamics of h s is built up of two processes the first one assumes that the local spatial h s field drifts with the median velocity v x v y the second process is a random change of h s during the drift following analysis of h s variability observed in buoys a first order auto regressive model was used to model the memory of the wave field leading to the following spatio temporal correlation function 8 ρ t x y exp x v x t 2 y v y t 2 2 l 2 exp λ t an illustration of the estimated v x v y is presented in fig 4 this type of spatial temporal correlation has been originally used in cox and isham 1988 and gupta and waymire 1987 for modeling rainfall the velocity field v x v y were estimated using ecmwf era5 reanalysis data and λ was estimated using time series of h s from buoy measurements it is done by fitting the temporal correlation 9 ρ t 0 0 exp t 2 2 t 2 exp λ t t l v to observed auto correlation in measured time series by buoys here v v x 2 v y 2 by combining the eqs 8 and 9 the correlation can be written in a more compact form as 10 ρ t x y exp t x y σ t x y t 2 exp λ t the matrix σ and constant λ also depend on season while for a period of month the time dependence can be neglected however in the scale of a ship s sailing voyage the dependence of the correlation function on a ship location p cannot be neglected consequently a global model for h s expressing the spatial variability of local models is needed 2 2 2 global model of h s in order to model the global variation of h s the local spatio temporal fields are further generalized to the global non homogeneous and non stationary fields this involved the evaluation of a flow defined by the velocity fields see baxevani et al 2008 such a model can be used in the time scale of a day but it is not convenient for load analysis for ocean crossing voyages that may take more than a week therefore the correlation eq 10 needs to be simplified following podgorski and rychlik 2014 the simplified model was used to approximate the local correlation of eq 9 as 11 ρ p t 0 0 exp t 2 2 τ 2 τ π λ t 2 λ 2 t 4 t 2 the parameter τ depends on the location p and season it is chosen in such a way that correlation given in eq 11 has the same correlation length as the one given in eq 9 using eq 11 instead of eq 9 the local spatio temporal correlation ρ in eq 8 in a neighborhood of the location p can be written as 12 ρ p t x y exp t x y p t x y t 2 where σ p is a positive definite matrix with elements depending on l v x v y and τ for the correlation structure of eq 12 the local spatio temporal field can be simulated as follows let introduce kernel f given by 13 f p q 2 π 3 4 σ p 1 4 e x p q σ p q t q t x y where σ is the determinant of σ the local gaussian model with the correlation function of eq 12 can be simulated by smoothing the gaussian white noise with kernel f p see lindgren 2012 for details on gaussian processes and fields more precisely an approximation of x t x y ln h s t x y is obtained by using a grid t k x i y j with discretization steps dx dy dt respectively subsequently 14 x t x y i j k f p t t k x x i y y i z i j k d x d y d t where z i j k are independent gaussian variables with a zero mean and variance of one now the global gaussian model is obtained by allowing the kernel to vary in terms of locations it is assumed that the kernel f p changes slowly with p x y using eq 14 the gaussian non homogenous field x p can be defined as 15 x t x y i j k f x y t t k x x i y y i z i j k d x d y d t then for any temporal and geographical locations p t p x p y p and q t q x q y q the covariance function of ln h s x t x y between p and q is 16 r p q 2 3 σ p 1 2 σ q 1 2 σ p 1 σ q 1 e z σ p 1 σ q 1 z t where z q p t q t p x q x p y q y p and σ is the determinant of σ consequently for any collections of locations p i i 1 n ln h s p i is a vector of gaussian variables with means m p i variances σ p i 2 and correlations ρ p i q i as in eq 4 and eq 16 2 2 3 simulation of encountered h s for a ship moving with velocity v ship the correlation between logarithms of encountered h s after time t is given by eq 8 with x y replaced by t v ship which simplifies to eq 9 with t l v shio v note that it is a local correlation it can be used for ship sailing with a speed of about 18 knots for about 12 h in order to derive explicit formulas for global correlations one first employs approximation given in eq 11 now the parameter τ is estimated by 17 τ λt v 2 λ 2 t v 4 t v 2 t v l v s h i p v the velocities v v x v y are shown as an example in fig 4 in general τ depends on routes season and position of vessel and speed computed from the route which is a function of time t the covariance between logarithms of encountered significant wave heights at time t s of eq 16 can be simplified to 18 r t s σ t σ s 2 τ t τ s τ t 2 τ s 2 e t s 2 τ t 2 τ s 2 the mean and variance of ln h s i e m t σ 2 t has been estimated using satellite measured h s however it can also be estimated from the era5 dataset let h s t denote the significant wave height observed at discretized waypoints t along a ship s route composed of n sea state waypoints with t t 1 t 2 t n then m t denotes the mean vector of the logarithms of h s t then the covariance matrix between sea states along the route can be estimated by eq 18 and is denoted by r t t finally the samples of h s t can be simulated by h s t exp m t r t t z where z is a vector of independent standard normal random variables while r t t is a matrix a such that r t t a t a 2 3 analysis of wave load and corresponding structural stress after getting the wave environments a ship s structural stresses in a specific sea state can be estimated by combining the wave spectrum and transfer function of stresses at various regular wave conditions e g fricke et al 2002 a sea state is often described by the significant wave height h s and mean wave period t z the sea surface of each sea state is composed of a range of regular waves that can be characterized by the wave spectrum s ω h s t z the wave spectrum also regarded as a short term description of the sea state are described by different classical spectrum models for maritime applications in this study the pierson moskowitz wave spectrum also known as the issc ittc spectrum is used as follows 19 s ω h s t z 4 π 3 h s 2 t z 4 ω 5 exp 1 π ω t z 2 π 4 when a ship is operated in the sea state denoted by s ω h s t z with a forward speed u and heading angle θ the wave loadings applied in ships e g vertical bending horizontal bending etc can be estimated in frequency domain as the transfer function h ω u θ assuming a linear hydrodynamic load for a specific ship structural detail the transfer function of its global stresses is often computed by adding responses caused by three major wave load components as in eq 20 20 h σ ω u θ a 1 h v ω u θ a 2 h h ω u θ a 3 h t ω u θ where a 1 a 2 and a 3 are the structural stress caused by a unit amplitude vertical bending horizontal bending and torsion respectively they can be computed by the beam theory or fe analysis as in mao et al 2015 h v h h and h t denote the transfer function raos for vertical horizontal bending moments and torsional moments respectively the raos of the above wave loading components can be estimated by a linear potential theory in the frequency domain e g lewis 1989 li et al 2014 subsequently the structural stress response spectrum s σ at the sea state s ω h s t z can be calculated as follows 21 s σ ω e u θ h s t z h σ ω e u θ 2 s ω e h s t z where the encountered wave frequency ω e and the encountered wave spectrum s ω e which depend on the ship s sailing speed u and heading angle θ should be used to get the response spectrum finally for the traditional high cycle fatigue assessment of ship structures the spectral moments of the stress response spectrum could be easily computed seen e g lewis 1989 mao et al 2015 here the sequential effects of stresses from varying sea environments for crack propagation analysis will be investigated to generate time series of stresses at a stationary sea state its stress response spectrum s σ ω is discretized into n intervals along its frequency as ω i i 1 2 n while dω ω i 1 ω i then stress signals with unit mpa can be simulated by superposition of n sinusoidal equations as follows 22 σ t i 1 n ζ i sin ω i t ε i where ζ i is the stress amplitude at the i th frequency interval ω j as ζ i 2 s σ ω i d ω and ε j is a phase random variable uniformly distributed in 0 2π 3 a case study ship with collected encountered wave and stress data a 2800teu containership equipped with a hull monitoring system is used to check the reliability of our two wave models during the measurement campaign during 2008 the ship was sailing in the north atlantic the full scale measurement data contains ship speeds waypoints wave spectrum measured by onboard radar and strain signal etc the measured campaign during 2008 includes 30 voyages as in fig 5 while a large amount of data is missing in 3 of the voyages hence only 27 voyages with rather complete data information are used for the following analysis it should be noted that the ship was equipped with a weather routing system to guide the ship s navigation in order to avoid harsh environments in the following analysis wave statistics encountered by this ship are compared with those obtained from the two statistical models reanalysis data and classification guidelines in addition the measured stress signals are used to calibrate and validate the parameters models chosen to estimate the stress response according to subsection 2 3 3 1 comparison of wave statistics the prediction of ship structural stress relies on the reliable description of long term wave statistics encountered during a ship s lifetime for ship design the wave statistics are often given as either a wave scatter diagram or probability distribution function e g weibull or lognormal that are collected over many years this section presents the comparison of the wave statistics encountered by the case study 2800teu containership first a typical time signal of significant wave height h s recorded by the ship is plotted against h s extracted from european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf dee and uppala 2008 and the japan weather association jwa reanalysis data in fig 6 it is shown that the variation of onboard measured h s can be well reflected by the ecmwf reanalysis data while the jwa data shows a large discrepancy of h s in comparison with the measured h s furthermore the measured h s are constantly larger than that from the ecmwf reanalysis dataset especially in the harsh sea environment where there are a lot of missing h s measurements this is due to the working capabilities of the wave radar sensors in high sea conditions with large ship motions as reported in mao et al 2010 the wave sensors overestimate h s around 15 30 in comparison with satellite measurements it was also confirmed by the ship s captain therefore the ecmwf reanalysis era5 dataset is used as the comparison reference secondly the probabilities of h s extracted from ecmwf and jwa for the recorded waypoints are fitted to weibull distributions to consider the long term probability h s extracted from ecmwf for the same locations of the recorded waypoints but during the year 2000 2015 the probability density function pdf of these fitted weibull probabilities are compared with that from dnvgl guidelines dnvgl 2014 for ships sailing in the north atlantic in fig 7 it is confirmed that the onboard wave radar sensors overestimate h s encountered by the ships giving a more considerably large number of higher waves waves larger than 5 m if the hindcast h s from ecmwf is taken as the reference the pdfs of h s from various sources differ significantly from each other it should be noted that even though weibull distribution is well recognized to well describe the probability of h s the right plot of fig 7 indicates some discrepancy of the actual h s probabilities from weibull distributions to quantify the difference the first three moments of the random variable h s collected from various sources are given in table 1 it shows that the moments of true h s from three hindcast sources are quite similar since the third moment of h s is approximately proportional to a ship s fatigue damage accumulation to use h s distribution by class guidelines may overestimate 100 of the ship s damage 3 2 calibration and validation of stress estimation in this paper the wave loading and induced structural stresses in ships are estimated following the procedure in section 2 3 the structural details of the 2800teu containership midsection are presented in fig 8 where the location attached with a strain sensor is shown as the red mark to validate and calibrate the procedure for stress simulation the measured stress signal at the marked location is taken as the reference since a ship s fatigue damage caused by a stress signal is often proportional to the standard deviation of stresses to the power 3 the standard deviations of measured stresses are firstly presented in fig 9 left plot for various sea states during the first 6 voyages of the measurement campaign different voyages can be easily distinguished through the variation of the stress standard deviation the ship was encountered at least one storm per voyage and the overall stress response in westbound voyages is larger than that in eastbound voyages then the third voyage voyage080218 is chosen for further investigation based on the h s extracted from the ecmwf hindcast data for the voyage the stress signals in this voyage are estimated using the presented procedure in section 2 3 the standard deviations of both the measured and estimated stress signals for each sea states are computed and presented in the right plot of fig 9 as well as the original time series of stresses the estimation procedures can give a well estimation of stress standard deviations there is a little variation of stress standard deviations in the late stage of the voyage it may be caused by the vibration of ship structures the simulated time series of stresses can well capture the trend of measured stress signals the difference may be caused by the simplification of the estimation procedure such as linear airy short term waves strip theory and beam theory for line ship response etc furthermore time series of stress signals are generated by the two wave models for the voyage080218 fig 10 presents a magnified view of the generated stress signals in comparison with the measured stresses when the ship is encountering high sea states in this voyage it is shown that the characteristic of stress variations in the two generated stress signals agrees well with that of the measured stresses therefore the stress generation method presented in section 2 3 is used to simulate stress signals based on the two wave models the applications of simulated stress signals for fatigue assessment are discussed to examine the impact uncertainty of fatigue life prediction due to various environmental inputs 4 validation of h s simulation from the two wave models when a ship is sailing at sea it is subjected to various load patterns with numerous magnitudes which cause deformation of its structure as well as stresses in the following the capabilities of two statistical wave load models to emulate the random nature of the waves are presented 4 1 sea state simulations by the two models first the natural variability of the wave environment is simulated by the spatio temporal and the storm wave model the yearly variability is presented in fig 11 where the significant wave height h s along the measurement routes are simulated by the spatio temporal model and the storm wave model respectively three years of simulated waves along the measured routes are compared with that of the observed waves extracted from the ecmwf hindcast data i e the h s along measured ship routes are simulated 3 times by the two models the observed time history of waves clearly show that the h s increases over time and reach a maximum value at one point then decrease gradually this tendency is successfully expressed by the spatio temporal model and the storm wave model simulated waves furthermore there is a clear separation zone to distinguish summer voyages with lower h s this phenomenon can be also seen from fig 11 upper plot and the storm profile i e h s variation in a storm is also well captured by the bottom plot of fig 11 in addition fig 12 presents the time series of h s for a typical ship voyage simulated by the spatio temporal model while fig 13 presents a typical storm condition reproduced by the storm model simulation even though the two statistical models cannot give the same time series of h s as the observed the statistical variability can be well captured by the two models 4 2 moments of h s by the two wave models in order to further examine the statistical quantities of h s simulated from the two wave models the first three moments of h s are estimated and listed in table 2 in table 2 the significant wave height signals are coming from three different sources i e extracted from ecmwf era5 hindcast dataset for the same location as the measured routes but with a varying year from 2000 to 2015 simulated 100 times of h s along the measured ship routes from the storm model and the spatio temporal model the yearly moments of h s are estimated for individual years the mean and standard deviation of these moments are calculated and listed in table 2 it shows that the variation of yearly h s is very small i e the standard deviation of e h s is very small for wave from all three sources the difference of the first three moments between the era5 and the spatio temporal model is less than 1 in general the wave statistics estimated from both the spatio temporal model and the storm model agree perfectly well with the era5 extracted h s since the third moment of h s is proportional to a ship s fatigue damage as reported in mao et al 2010 these two wave models could be used for easy fatigue assessment 4 3 other capabilities of two wave models since the statistical spatio temporal model is established to provide good correlation structure of h s among a series of waypoints location and time this model could be used to simulate h s for a fixed location along with arbitrary ship routes in addition to model the variability and statistics of h s along a specific ship route in particular this spatio temporal wave model could predict interpolate h s of several waypoints conditionally on the given wave information surrounding the waypoints along the same ship route one such an example is demonstrated in fig 14 which presents two westbound voyages with a few missing h s measurements these missing points often happen in the harsh sea environment based on the spatio temporal model the interpolated h s is also presented together with the observed h s it seems that the basic wave variation is well described by the interpolated h s through the spatio temporal wave model in the storm model simulation the wave scatter diagram is assembled from the ecmwf hindcast data for the measured routes waypoints chosen as the source wave data then the joint probability distribution of h s and t z and the long term probability distribution of h s is determined in each simulation 64 sequences are generated randomly by following each route furthermore the storm wave load sequence is assembled so that 1 a modification to the storm profile configuration so the variation of the storm duration can be considered and 2 examines the realistic modeling of the encountering wave condition of ocean going ships considering the occurrence probability distribution of the wave direction 5 application of the two wave models for ship fatigue assessment the two wave models can be used in ship safety analysis such as ship fatigue assessment prediction of extreme wave conditions etc in this study the structural detail of the same 2800teu containership as in fig 8 is used to demonstrate the application for ship fatigue assessment first the ship s operational wave environments and corresponding stress signals are generated according to the method introduced in section 2 then the high cycle fatigue damage is estimated for those generated stresses finally the structural detail is simplified and an initial crack length is assumed to be 22 mm the crack propagations under these generated stress signals are estimated by the fastran ii which is also validated by the experimental data using the simplified structural details in order to validate the capabilities of the two models the damages and crack propagations are compared with those estimated from the measured stress signals 5 1 high cycle fatigue damage assessment for the generated and measured stress signals σ t t 0 t the rainflow counting method is used to get all the stress cycles with their ranges denoted by s i i 1 2 n then the accumulated fatigue damage d t during the time period 0 t is estimated by the palmgren miner rule 23 d t i 1 n s c f s i k α where the parameters of the one slope s n curve are chosen as α 1 0e12 67 and k 3 while the structural stress concentration factor scf is set to 1 27 according to dnv gl 2015 for the chosen structural detail its nominal structural stress signals during 2008 were measured by a hull monitoring system mao et al 2012 referred as the measured stress here in addition the encountered wave conditions are also extracted from the ecmwf hindcast era5 dataset based on the ship s sailing courses in 2008 in order to study the variation of encountered wave conditions in the same sailing area the wave conditions are obtained for the measured ship routes but in different years i e from 2001 to 2015 furthermore the wave conditions are simulated 50 times by the statistical spatio temporal model and the storm model respectively assuming the ship was sailing in the same heading angles and speeds as the measured routes the corresponding structural stress signals are estimated by the proposed approach in section 2 finally the accumulated high cycle fatigue damages during one sailing year caused by the obtained stress signals are estimated by eq 23 fig 15 presents both the mean and 95 confidence interval of the fatigue damages for simulated stresses caused under various wave conditions the fatigue damages estimated from the extracted era wave for the same ship routes agree well with the measured fatigue damages some discrepancies are founded in the first three winter voyages in general the proposed method to simulate a ship s structural stress response in section 2 is accurate to validate the applications of the two statistical wave models for the ship fatigue assessment if the ship is assumed to be sailing in the same routes for other 15 years i e wave conditions from era5 dataset there are large variations of fatigue damage during these years the fatigue damages estimated from the measured stresses are relatively lower in comparison with other years this is because that the ship was assisted by a weather routing system to avoid harsh weather environment during her sailing in open sea mao et al 2012 but the weather routing service in the first voyage during 2008 was not efficient as also indicated in fig 5 left plot in the first voyage the ship was sailing in a very southward course but still encountered three big storms this fact is also reflected in fig 15 showing that the measured fatigue damages during the first 300 sea states are rather higher than those estimated by other approaches it should be noted that the fatigue damage accumulations during the winter seasons first 1200 sea states are much higher than the rest of the year furthermore the mean and standard deviation of accumulated fatigue damages during 1 year that are estimated from different generated stress signals are presented in table 3 it indicates that both the spatio temporal wave model and the storm model can describe well the wave variation encountered by ships as extracted from the 15 years of hindcast wave information the spatio temporal model can well capture the wave variation among various ship routes in different sailing months the storm model gives conservative predictions of expected damage with wider confidence intervals this can be partially explained by fact that this model does not relay on precise knowledge of the routes and the way storms are distributed along the ship route the storm model can be very useful at design stage when ship routes are uncertain the spatio temporal model could be used to predict the accumulated damage for given routes e g help to plan a ship s navigation paths in the future these two models will be combined to provide wave information for ship design but considering a ship s practical navigations during her service time 5 2 crack propagation analysis the two statistical wave models can be used to simulate ship stress signals and model the overall variation of stresses during a ship s service time as demonstrated in the above subsection furthermore they can be also used to model the sequential variation of stress signals that are important for e g crack propagation analysis of ship structures in the following the capability to model sequential effect to crack propagation by the two wave models are investigated using the same stress signals presented in fig 15 the structural details are simplified into a well known experimental specimen as in fig 16 the linear elastic fracture mechanics is employed to estimate the crack propagation here in this study in order to consider the crack closure phenomena the crack propagation curve i e the paris law paris and erdogan 1963 is modified according to newman 1992 as follows 24 d a d n c δ k e f f m 1 δ k e f f t h δ k e f f 1 δ k max η 2 when δ k e f f δ k e f f t h 0 otherwise δ k e f f k m a x k o p e n where the material parameters are obtained from the japanese ship research report sr219 with c 2 60e 11 m 2 75 η 590 m p a m 1 2 and the effective threshold stress intensity factor range δk eff th 2 00 m p a m 1 2 in the analysis the critical step is to get the maximum stress intensity factor k max and the opening stress intensity factor k open of stress cycles that depends on the structural and crack details as well as the given stress cycle in this study those values are estimated by fastran ii newman 1992 in order to validate the crack propagation analysis by the fastran code the experimental tests of the same specimen as in fig 16 under a sequence of clustered loading and varying the mean stress level every 10 clustered loadings as fig 17 left plot are employed the observed crack propagation is compared with that estimated by the fastran code is presented in fig 17 right plot it shows that even under the same stress signals the crack propagation behaves different in the experimental results due to stress sequential effect to the structural crack growth the results of crack growth from fastran analysis agree well with the experimental results therefore fastran is used for the following fatigue crack propagation analysis by means of the fastran analysis the crack propagations of the structural details under the same stress signals as in fig 15 are presented in fig 18 the total crack growth during 1 year under those stresses is also listed in table 3 it confirmed the benefits of using a weather routing service to avoid encountering harsh sea environments the crack propagation due to measured stress is almost the lowest among all crack growth results the mistakes of weather routing in the first ship route also have very big impact leading to significant crack propagation during this voyage and the crack growth rate during this voyage is much higher than those estimated using other years wave conditions the seasonal impact to crack propagation is even more obvious than the high cycle fatigue accumulation i e the observed crack growth is almost stopped in the summer voyages the stress signals generated from the storm model make a slightly faster crack growth propagation than those from the spatio temporal model and era5 during the 1 year sailing the right plot of fig 18 shows the mean and 95 confidence interval of crack propagation as errorbars during this one year s sailing in general both the spatio temporal wave model and the storm model are capable to reproduce the stochastic nature of wave environments along arbitrary ship routes and can be used to estimate the crack propagation with acceptable agreement 6 conclusions conventional fatigue design of ship structures strongly depends on the reliable description of long term wave environments encountered by the ship in this study two statistical wave models are briefly presented and their applications to generate stress signals for ship fatigue assessment are demonstrated the full scale measurements of a 2800teu containership including stress signals ship routes encountered wave conditions sailing speed and heading angles etc are used to investigate their capabilities of modelling wave environments encountered by ships through the comparison of the long term distribution of h s obtained from various approaches it is concluded that the actual wave environments encountered by the ship differ significantly from the wave scatter diagram provided by class guidelines for ship fatigue design the difference can easily lead to 100 overestimation of fatigue damage from class guidelines furthermore today s onboard wave radar sensor can provide rough approximation of a ship s encountered sea conditions but the measured significant wave height may contain large errors in comparison with the hindcast wave data in particular at harsh sea environments however the two statistical wave models can well describe the wave statistics of the ship s encountered sea environments in addition the spatio temporal wave model can describe the wave correlation in both space and time it can be used to simulate wave environments along arbitrary ship routes and interpolate missing wave measurement for chosen ship routes both wave models can be used to estimate the stress signals of ship structural details and subsequently analyze the fatigue damage accumulation along specific ship voyages the statistical scatter of the analyzed fatigue damage based on the two wave models can also reflect the actual fatigue damage scatter that estimated from the 15 years of hindcast wave data moreover the stress sequential effects on a ship s crack propagation due to the temporal variation of encountered sea states and the corresponding stress response can also be modelled by the two wave models their capability is validated by the crack propagation analysis using the measured stress signals the study shows that the two wave models have the potential to be applicable and useful for enhanced and more realistic fatigue life prediction of ship structures

22603,ocean crossing ship structures are continuously suffering from wave loads when sailing at sea the wave loads cause large variation of structural stresses leading to fatigue accumulation in ship structures for the fatigue life prediction of ship structures it is important to obtain both the long term distribution and the time history of wave induced loads an essential step is to get reliable wave statistics and accurate description of the stochastic nature of sea state along a ship s sailing routes during her service time generally the wave statistics are provided by the classification societies as a joint probability of significant wave height and mean wave period also known as wave scatter diagram in addition different statistical wave models have been developed to describe wave environments along arbitrary shipping routes based on different data sources e g hindcast data satellite measurements buoys etc in this paper two statistical wave models based on hindcast data and satellite wave measurements are briefly introduced and compared with the wave measurements carried out by onboard radar both of the wave models are then used to generate the wave environments along given shipping routes the effectiveness of the wave models is demonstrated by comparing the stochastic nature and the statistical characteristics of simulated sea state histories with those of the source oceanographic data finally an application of the wave model to the fatigue assessment is presented keywords significant wave height mean wave period spatio temporal wave model storm model wave statistics ship fatigue design 1 introduction with the vast development of shipbuilding technology and global shipping activities the size of constructed ships has been increased dramatically during the past decade in particular for container ships among various kinds of structural problem nowadays fatigue damage to the hull structure is one of the most serious problems to be challenged furthermore the complexities on the modern ship and the increasing demands for greater reliability efficiency and economy require a scientific powerful and versatile method for their structural design ships and marine structure encounter an infinite variety of wave loading conditions the wave loading applied on ships can cause continuously varying structural stresses which will result in fatigue damage accumulation in ship structures ship fatigue analysis often include large uncertainties fricke et al 2002 which may be caused by e g material properties treatment of redistribution of residual stresses the corrosion weld defects and wave load computations etc in particular large uncertainties are associated with the difference of the provided from actual wave environments encountered by a ship olsen et al 2005 mao 2010 mao et al 2013 etc these uncertainties may lead to fatigue cracks initiated much earlier than expected jordan and knight 1980 storhaug et al 2007 generally the wave statistics are provided by the classification society guidelines as a joint probability distribution of significant wave height and mean wave period also known as the wave scatter diagram the wave scatters reflect the long term distribution of waves encountered by all ships sailing at these specific areas therefore the actual wave environment encountered by individual ships may be not consistent with that provided by the classification societies guidelines that are unlikely to consider operational conditions for individual ships mao et al 2010 2012 in addition the wave scatters provided by different classification societies might differ even for the same ship fatigue design olsen et al 2005 in order to provide more realistic wave information for ship design and operation various sensors have been launched to collect wave data e g buoy data onboard observations satellite measurements and reanalysis data etc furthermore various statistical wave models have been developed to model wave environments along arbitrary shipping routes these wave models can be used to generate wave conditions encountered along a ship s actual sailing routes then that generated wave information can be taken as input for ship fatigue design and extreme loading predictions etc in this paper two statistical wave models one is based on wave scatter data extracted from reanalysis dataset along ship routes de gracia et al 2017 and the other is based on the spatio temporal correlation of wave from reanalysis and satellite measurements are briefly introduced in mao 2014 their capabilities to describe the statistical properties of wave conditions encountered by a specific ship are validated using the full scale measurement data which was collected in a 2800teu containership when sailing in the north atlantic during 2008 mao 2010 the stochastic nature and the statistical characteristics of sea states generated from the two wave models are compared with sea information extracted from oceanographic reanalysis database data actual onboard measurement and that provided by classification society guidelines for ship fatigue assessment furthermore a simplified ship structural detail is selected to demonstrate the application of these two models for actual fatigue assessment of ship structures based on the sea environments and stress histories generated by the two models both the conventional high cycle fatigue life prediction and crack propagation method are demonstrated and compared with the results obtained from measured stress in the same containership the following part of the paper is organized as follows to make the completeness of the paper section 2 briefly presents the basic information of the two statistical models the case study vessel and her collected wave information are presented in section 3 section 4 presents the comparison of long term wave statistics obtained from various sources as well as the pros and cons of these two wave models then section 5 presents the application studies for fatigue assessments of a simplified ship structural detail finally the conclusion is given in section 6 2 two wave generation models and ship stress generation for the initial design of marine structures e g ships offshore platforms offshore wind turbines etc it is essential to get accurate long term sea environmental data for their trade areas one conventional way is to use the so called wave scatter diagram provided by classification guidelines the scatter diagram can describe average wave statistics for all ships sailing in the specific region but it may differ from that encountered by individual ships in particular today s ships are equipped with various modern navigation systems such as weather routing voyage optimization systems etc which can help ships to sail in specific sea environments according to the ship s trade objectives mao et al 2012 mao 2014 it means that the actual encountered sea conditions can differ significantly from that provided by design guidelines leading to large uncertainties in ship design e g fatigue life and extreme loading predictions hence it is needed to develop models to describe the long term wave environments encountered by ships during their service life in this section two different statistical wave models developed at the authors research groups are briefly presented 2 1 the storm wave model the first generation storm model 1g storm model was proposed by tomita et al 1995 to emulate real random significant wave height time histories and examine fatigue crack growth behavior under random loading based on collected wave data of ships that sailed on the pacific ocean the model presumes that the wave oceanography phenomena is possible to divide mainly into two conditions calm sea and storm conditions as in fig 1 furthermore sailing in calm sea condition the encountered sea state history can be modeled as a time independent random process and in the storm condition the significant wave height increase over time and reaches a maximum value at one point only before decreasing gradually thus encountered significant wave height in a storm condition is a time dependent process these two conditions appear alternately in random order as in fig 1 kawabe 2002 proposed a modified version of the 1g storm model this model considered the correlation between significant wave height h s and mean wave periods t z by using the joint probability of h s and t z both of tomita and kawabe model is derived from a single wave scatter diagram by using a trial and error manner further the 3g storm model that apply automatic storm configuration consider the fluctuation of storm duration on the short sea history and generate equivalent sea state history from the data with various observation period was presented in prasetyo et al 2012 recently a more advanced storm model called 4g storm model has been developed de gracia et al 2017 for the realistic modeling of encountered wave conditions the 4g storm model considers the occurrence probability distribution of the wave direction to evaluate a ship s stress response it means that the change of relative heading angle during the sailing period can be simulated let hs avg be the h s for the whole ship life average hs ext is the maximum h s that occurs once in the whole ship s lifetime and hs max i is the maximum h s in i th storm class s i thus the storm is classified based on hs max i and its range between hs ext to hs avg first the generation of h s time history needs a storm profile configuration details can be found in prasetyo 2013 the storm profile is the sea state information consisting of the significant wave height sequence and the occurrence probability of storms with various maximum wave heights the storm profile is configured based on assumptions such as the ship s target design life is 25 years the duration of the storm is varied with 3 998 days average and 1 822 days deviation and is composed by the probability density of the storm p storm and calm sea p calm the probability density of the h s in a calm sea p calm h s the probability density of the i th storm class s i p storm i and the h s profile for each storm class n h s i the long term distribution of h s is assumed to follow the weibull distribution and joint probability distribution of the significant wave height h s and mean wave period t z is refitted by obeying the conditional of the lognormal distribution of t z given h s kawabe 2002 thus the parameters of the weibull distribution shape and scale parameters are identified from wave measurement along the ship routes the h s profile in a storm n h s i is determined based on the assumption that this profile is distributed by the following the tail of the weibull distribution the h s history in position p and at time t h s p t is modeled by using the storm profile configuration as described above the position p and the time t are related to the existing wave data point herein called point and season for the chosen point and season random h s is generated as follows decide between the calm and storm sea condition by random number selection considering the occurrence probability of storm seas and calm seas p calm and p storm for a calm sea condition a random sequence of h s is generated by obeying p calm h s for a storm sea condition decide the storm class by random number selection the variation of the duration of the storm d var is chosen so it fits the single normal distribution for the storm class s i generate a crescendo decrescendo sequence of h s according to eq 1 1 n h s d v a r i n h s i d v a r 3 5 once h s is determined the mean period t z is determined by random number selection using the conditional probability of t z given h s proposed in wan and shinkai 1995 as presented in eq 2 2 p t z h s exp ln t z μ 2 2 σ 2 α t z h s α t z h s 1 2 π t z σ μ e ln t z h s σ 2 var ln t z h s where p t z h s is the conditional probability density for t z given h s the joint probability distribution p h s t z is calculated by the following eq 3 3 p hs tz p hs p tz hs a sequence of the storm and calm sea conditions are generated by sampling with replacement fig 2 shows an example of a time history of significant wave height with variable storm duration generated by storm model simulation 2 2 the statistical spatio temporal wave model the variation of significant wave height h s is often described as the long term distribution of h s at some location or region the long term distribution can be interpreted as variability of h s at a randomly taken time during a year it is often fitted with a weibull distribution limiting time span to a specific time window such as january month will affect the h s distribution because the variability of h s depends on seasons by shrinking the time span to a single moment t and the geographical region to a location x y the distribution of h s t x y can be obtained this is the meaning of spatio temporal wave model distribution for significant wave height h s in this subsection according to the study in baxevani et al 2005 for a time period limited to a couple of weeks and regions of about 4 in diameter the significant wave height h s is log normal distributed i e ln h s t x y is normal distributed with mean m t x y and variance σ 2 x y at a fixed position denoted by p the temporal variability of the mean m p t is modeled by means of annual cycle 4 m p t β 0 β 1 cos ϕ t β 2 sin ϕ t ϕ 2 π 365 2 here the time t is measured in days and the parameters β 0 β 1 β 2 depend on geographical location p furthermore from a local perspective i e in a neighborhood of location p the spatial correlation between the logarithms of h s at q with the distance x y to p i e x y q p unit km could be sufficiently accurately described by 5 ρ p x y exp x 2 y 2 2 l p 2 where l p units km is regarded as the correlation length depends on the geographical location of the center p of the small region and with the month the random surface ln h s x y has a 2 dimensional spectrum 6 s p ω 1 ω 2 σ p 2 l p 2 2 π e l p 2 ω 1 2 ω 2 2 2 the local spatial field in a neighborhood of the geographical location p can be approximated by 7 ln h s x y δ ω s p ω i ω j r i j cos x ω i y ω j e i j where δ ω ω i 1 ω i r ij e ij are independent rayleigh and uniformly distributed variables respectively note that the model of β 0 β 1 β 2 l p and σ p 2 was fitted to the satellite topex poseidon data and that the geographical distance x y are in equivalent degrees so that degree in both longitude and latitude stands for the same distance when measured in kilometers see baxevani et al 2005 for north atlantic finally spatial models for the variability of the significant wave height on the world oceans can be accessed in baxevani et al 2008 an example of the median value is presented in fig 3 the parameters β σ 2 and the correlation lengths l has been estimated at 1861 different 4 4 degrees regions 2 2 1 local h s dynamics the variability of significant wave height in time and space has been studied in baxevani et al 2008 where a local spatio temporal ln h s t x y was proposed in this spatio temporal model a moving storm of median velocity v x v y is used to model drift of ln h s t x y the velocity was first introduced in longuet higgins 1957 more precisely in this spatio temporal model the dynamics of h s is built up of two processes the first one assumes that the local spatial h s field drifts with the median velocity v x v y the second process is a random change of h s during the drift following analysis of h s variability observed in buoys a first order auto regressive model was used to model the memory of the wave field leading to the following spatio temporal correlation function 8 ρ t x y exp x v x t 2 y v y t 2 2 l 2 exp λ t an illustration of the estimated v x v y is presented in fig 4 this type of spatial temporal correlation has been originally used in cox and isham 1988 and gupta and waymire 1987 for modeling rainfall the velocity field v x v y were estimated using ecmwf era5 reanalysis data and λ was estimated using time series of h s from buoy measurements it is done by fitting the temporal correlation 9 ρ t 0 0 exp t 2 2 t 2 exp λ t t l v to observed auto correlation in measured time series by buoys here v v x 2 v y 2 by combining the eqs 8 and 9 the correlation can be written in a more compact form as 10 ρ t x y exp t x y σ t x y t 2 exp λ t the matrix σ and constant λ also depend on season while for a period of month the time dependence can be neglected however in the scale of a ship s sailing voyage the dependence of the correlation function on a ship location p cannot be neglected consequently a global model for h s expressing the spatial variability of local models is needed 2 2 2 global model of h s in order to model the global variation of h s the local spatio temporal fields are further generalized to the global non homogeneous and non stationary fields this involved the evaluation of a flow defined by the velocity fields see baxevani et al 2008 such a model can be used in the time scale of a day but it is not convenient for load analysis for ocean crossing voyages that may take more than a week therefore the correlation eq 10 needs to be simplified following podgorski and rychlik 2014 the simplified model was used to approximate the local correlation of eq 9 as 11 ρ p t 0 0 exp t 2 2 τ 2 τ π λ t 2 λ 2 t 4 t 2 the parameter τ depends on the location p and season it is chosen in such a way that correlation given in eq 11 has the same correlation length as the one given in eq 9 using eq 11 instead of eq 9 the local spatio temporal correlation ρ in eq 8 in a neighborhood of the location p can be written as 12 ρ p t x y exp t x y p t x y t 2 where σ p is a positive definite matrix with elements depending on l v x v y and τ for the correlation structure of eq 12 the local spatio temporal field can be simulated as follows let introduce kernel f given by 13 f p q 2 π 3 4 σ p 1 4 e x p q σ p q t q t x y where σ is the determinant of σ the local gaussian model with the correlation function of eq 12 can be simulated by smoothing the gaussian white noise with kernel f p see lindgren 2012 for details on gaussian processes and fields more precisely an approximation of x t x y ln h s t x y is obtained by using a grid t k x i y j with discretization steps dx dy dt respectively subsequently 14 x t x y i j k f p t t k x x i y y i z i j k d x d y d t where z i j k are independent gaussian variables with a zero mean and variance of one now the global gaussian model is obtained by allowing the kernel to vary in terms of locations it is assumed that the kernel f p changes slowly with p x y using eq 14 the gaussian non homogenous field x p can be defined as 15 x t x y i j k f x y t t k x x i y y i z i j k d x d y d t then for any temporal and geographical locations p t p x p y p and q t q x q y q the covariance function of ln h s x t x y between p and q is 16 r p q 2 3 σ p 1 2 σ q 1 2 σ p 1 σ q 1 e z σ p 1 σ q 1 z t where z q p t q t p x q x p y q y p and σ is the determinant of σ consequently for any collections of locations p i i 1 n ln h s p i is a vector of gaussian variables with means m p i variances σ p i 2 and correlations ρ p i q i as in eq 4 and eq 16 2 2 3 simulation of encountered h s for a ship moving with velocity v ship the correlation between logarithms of encountered h s after time t is given by eq 8 with x y replaced by t v ship which simplifies to eq 9 with t l v shio v note that it is a local correlation it can be used for ship sailing with a speed of about 18 knots for about 12 h in order to derive explicit formulas for global correlations one first employs approximation given in eq 11 now the parameter τ is estimated by 17 τ λt v 2 λ 2 t v 4 t v 2 t v l v s h i p v the velocities v v x v y are shown as an example in fig 4 in general τ depends on routes season and position of vessel and speed computed from the route which is a function of time t the covariance between logarithms of encountered significant wave heights at time t s of eq 16 can be simplified to 18 r t s σ t σ s 2 τ t τ s τ t 2 τ s 2 e t s 2 τ t 2 τ s 2 the mean and variance of ln h s i e m t σ 2 t has been estimated using satellite measured h s however it can also be estimated from the era5 dataset let h s t denote the significant wave height observed at discretized waypoints t along a ship s route composed of n sea state waypoints with t t 1 t 2 t n then m t denotes the mean vector of the logarithms of h s t then the covariance matrix between sea states along the route can be estimated by eq 18 and is denoted by r t t finally the samples of h s t can be simulated by h s t exp m t r t t z where z is a vector of independent standard normal random variables while r t t is a matrix a such that r t t a t a 2 3 analysis of wave load and corresponding structural stress after getting the wave environments a ship s structural stresses in a specific sea state can be estimated by combining the wave spectrum and transfer function of stresses at various regular wave conditions e g fricke et al 2002 a sea state is often described by the significant wave height h s and mean wave period t z the sea surface of each sea state is composed of a range of regular waves that can be characterized by the wave spectrum s ω h s t z the wave spectrum also regarded as a short term description of the sea state are described by different classical spectrum models for maritime applications in this study the pierson moskowitz wave spectrum also known as the issc ittc spectrum is used as follows 19 s ω h s t z 4 π 3 h s 2 t z 4 ω 5 exp 1 π ω t z 2 π 4 when a ship is operated in the sea state denoted by s ω h s t z with a forward speed u and heading angle θ the wave loadings applied in ships e g vertical bending horizontal bending etc can be estimated in frequency domain as the transfer function h ω u θ assuming a linear hydrodynamic load for a specific ship structural detail the transfer function of its global stresses is often computed by adding responses caused by three major wave load components as in eq 20 20 h σ ω u θ a 1 h v ω u θ a 2 h h ω u θ a 3 h t ω u θ where a 1 a 2 and a 3 are the structural stress caused by a unit amplitude vertical bending horizontal bending and torsion respectively they can be computed by the beam theory or fe analysis as in mao et al 2015 h v h h and h t denote the transfer function raos for vertical horizontal bending moments and torsional moments respectively the raos of the above wave loading components can be estimated by a linear potential theory in the frequency domain e g lewis 1989 li et al 2014 subsequently the structural stress response spectrum s σ at the sea state s ω h s t z can be calculated as follows 21 s σ ω e u θ h s t z h σ ω e u θ 2 s ω e h s t z where the encountered wave frequency ω e and the encountered wave spectrum s ω e which depend on the ship s sailing speed u and heading angle θ should be used to get the response spectrum finally for the traditional high cycle fatigue assessment of ship structures the spectral moments of the stress response spectrum could be easily computed seen e g lewis 1989 mao et al 2015 here the sequential effects of stresses from varying sea environments for crack propagation analysis will be investigated to generate time series of stresses at a stationary sea state its stress response spectrum s σ ω is discretized into n intervals along its frequency as ω i i 1 2 n while dω ω i 1 ω i then stress signals with unit mpa can be simulated by superposition of n sinusoidal equations as follows 22 σ t i 1 n ζ i sin ω i t ε i where ζ i is the stress amplitude at the i th frequency interval ω j as ζ i 2 s σ ω i d ω and ε j is a phase random variable uniformly distributed in 0 2π 3 a case study ship with collected encountered wave and stress data a 2800teu containership equipped with a hull monitoring system is used to check the reliability of our two wave models during the measurement campaign during 2008 the ship was sailing in the north atlantic the full scale measurement data contains ship speeds waypoints wave spectrum measured by onboard radar and strain signal etc the measured campaign during 2008 includes 30 voyages as in fig 5 while a large amount of data is missing in 3 of the voyages hence only 27 voyages with rather complete data information are used for the following analysis it should be noted that the ship was equipped with a weather routing system to guide the ship s navigation in order to avoid harsh environments in the following analysis wave statistics encountered by this ship are compared with those obtained from the two statistical models reanalysis data and classification guidelines in addition the measured stress signals are used to calibrate and validate the parameters models chosen to estimate the stress response according to subsection 2 3 3 1 comparison of wave statistics the prediction of ship structural stress relies on the reliable description of long term wave statistics encountered during a ship s lifetime for ship design the wave statistics are often given as either a wave scatter diagram or probability distribution function e g weibull or lognormal that are collected over many years this section presents the comparison of the wave statistics encountered by the case study 2800teu containership first a typical time signal of significant wave height h s recorded by the ship is plotted against h s extracted from european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf dee and uppala 2008 and the japan weather association jwa reanalysis data in fig 6 it is shown that the variation of onboard measured h s can be well reflected by the ecmwf reanalysis data while the jwa data shows a large discrepancy of h s in comparison with the measured h s furthermore the measured h s are constantly larger than that from the ecmwf reanalysis dataset especially in the harsh sea environment where there are a lot of missing h s measurements this is due to the working capabilities of the wave radar sensors in high sea conditions with large ship motions as reported in mao et al 2010 the wave sensors overestimate h s around 15 30 in comparison with satellite measurements it was also confirmed by the ship s captain therefore the ecmwf reanalysis era5 dataset is used as the comparison reference secondly the probabilities of h s extracted from ecmwf and jwa for the recorded waypoints are fitted to weibull distributions to consider the long term probability h s extracted from ecmwf for the same locations of the recorded waypoints but during the year 2000 2015 the probability density function pdf of these fitted weibull probabilities are compared with that from dnvgl guidelines dnvgl 2014 for ships sailing in the north atlantic in fig 7 it is confirmed that the onboard wave radar sensors overestimate h s encountered by the ships giving a more considerably large number of higher waves waves larger than 5 m if the hindcast h s from ecmwf is taken as the reference the pdfs of h s from various sources differ significantly from each other it should be noted that even though weibull distribution is well recognized to well describe the probability of h s the right plot of fig 7 indicates some discrepancy of the actual h s probabilities from weibull distributions to quantify the difference the first three moments of the random variable h s collected from various sources are given in table 1 it shows that the moments of true h s from three hindcast sources are quite similar since the third moment of h s is approximately proportional to a ship s fatigue damage accumulation to use h s distribution by class guidelines may overestimate 100 of the ship s damage 3 2 calibration and validation of stress estimation in this paper the wave loading and induced structural stresses in ships are estimated following the procedure in section 2 3 the structural details of the 2800teu containership midsection are presented in fig 8 where the location attached with a strain sensor is shown as the red mark to validate and calibrate the procedure for stress simulation the measured stress signal at the marked location is taken as the reference since a ship s fatigue damage caused by a stress signal is often proportional to the standard deviation of stresses to the power 3 the standard deviations of measured stresses are firstly presented in fig 9 left plot for various sea states during the first 6 voyages of the measurement campaign different voyages can be easily distinguished through the variation of the stress standard deviation the ship was encountered at least one storm per voyage and the overall stress response in westbound voyages is larger than that in eastbound voyages then the third voyage voyage080218 is chosen for further investigation based on the h s extracted from the ecmwf hindcast data for the voyage the stress signals in this voyage are estimated using the presented procedure in section 2 3 the standard deviations of both the measured and estimated stress signals for each sea states are computed and presented in the right plot of fig 9 as well as the original time series of stresses the estimation procedures can give a well estimation of stress standard deviations there is a little variation of stress standard deviations in the late stage of the voyage it may be caused by the vibration of ship structures the simulated time series of stresses can well capture the trend of measured stress signals the difference may be caused by the simplification of the estimation procedure such as linear airy short term waves strip theory and beam theory for line ship response etc furthermore time series of stress signals are generated by the two wave models for the voyage080218 fig 10 presents a magnified view of the generated stress signals in comparison with the measured stresses when the ship is encountering high sea states in this voyage it is shown that the characteristic of stress variations in the two generated stress signals agrees well with that of the measured stresses therefore the stress generation method presented in section 2 3 is used to simulate stress signals based on the two wave models the applications of simulated stress signals for fatigue assessment are discussed to examine the impact uncertainty of fatigue life prediction due to various environmental inputs 4 validation of h s simulation from the two wave models when a ship is sailing at sea it is subjected to various load patterns with numerous magnitudes which cause deformation of its structure as well as stresses in the following the capabilities of two statistical wave load models to emulate the random nature of the waves are presented 4 1 sea state simulations by the two models first the natural variability of the wave environment is simulated by the spatio temporal and the storm wave model the yearly variability is presented in fig 11 where the significant wave height h s along the measurement routes are simulated by the spatio temporal model and the storm wave model respectively three years of simulated waves along the measured routes are compared with that of the observed waves extracted from the ecmwf hindcast data i e the h s along measured ship routes are simulated 3 times by the two models the observed time history of waves clearly show that the h s increases over time and reach a maximum value at one point then decrease gradually this tendency is successfully expressed by the spatio temporal model and the storm wave model simulated waves furthermore there is a clear separation zone to distinguish summer voyages with lower h s this phenomenon can be also seen from fig 11 upper plot and the storm profile i e h s variation in a storm is also well captured by the bottom plot of fig 11 in addition fig 12 presents the time series of h s for a typical ship voyage simulated by the spatio temporal model while fig 13 presents a typical storm condition reproduced by the storm model simulation even though the two statistical models cannot give the same time series of h s as the observed the statistical variability can be well captured by the two models 4 2 moments of h s by the two wave models in order to further examine the statistical quantities of h s simulated from the two wave models the first three moments of h s are estimated and listed in table 2 in table 2 the significant wave height signals are coming from three different sources i e extracted from ecmwf era5 hindcast dataset for the same location as the measured routes but with a varying year from 2000 to 2015 simulated 100 times of h s along the measured ship routes from the storm model and the spatio temporal model the yearly moments of h s are estimated for individual years the mean and standard deviation of these moments are calculated and listed in table 2 it shows that the variation of yearly h s is very small i e the standard deviation of e h s is very small for wave from all three sources the difference of the first three moments between the era5 and the spatio temporal model is less than 1 in general the wave statistics estimated from both the spatio temporal model and the storm model agree perfectly well with the era5 extracted h s since the third moment of h s is proportional to a ship s fatigue damage as reported in mao et al 2010 these two wave models could be used for easy fatigue assessment 4 3 other capabilities of two wave models since the statistical spatio temporal model is established to provide good correlation structure of h s among a series of waypoints location and time this model could be used to simulate h s for a fixed location along with arbitrary ship routes in addition to model the variability and statistics of h s along a specific ship route in particular this spatio temporal wave model could predict interpolate h s of several waypoints conditionally on the given wave information surrounding the waypoints along the same ship route one such an example is demonstrated in fig 14 which presents two westbound voyages with a few missing h s measurements these missing points often happen in the harsh sea environment based on the spatio temporal model the interpolated h s is also presented together with the observed h s it seems that the basic wave variation is well described by the interpolated h s through the spatio temporal wave model in the storm model simulation the wave scatter diagram is assembled from the ecmwf hindcast data for the measured routes waypoints chosen as the source wave data then the joint probability distribution of h s and t z and the long term probability distribution of h s is determined in each simulation 64 sequences are generated randomly by following each route furthermore the storm wave load sequence is assembled so that 1 a modification to the storm profile configuration so the variation of the storm duration can be considered and 2 examines the realistic modeling of the encountering wave condition of ocean going ships considering the occurrence probability distribution of the wave direction 5 application of the two wave models for ship fatigue assessment the two wave models can be used in ship safety analysis such as ship fatigue assessment prediction of extreme wave conditions etc in this study the structural detail of the same 2800teu containership as in fig 8 is used to demonstrate the application for ship fatigue assessment first the ship s operational wave environments and corresponding stress signals are generated according to the method introduced in section 2 then the high cycle fatigue damage is estimated for those generated stresses finally the structural detail is simplified and an initial crack length is assumed to be 22 mm the crack propagations under these generated stress signals are estimated by the fastran ii which is also validated by the experimental data using the simplified structural details in order to validate the capabilities of the two models the damages and crack propagations are compared with those estimated from the measured stress signals 5 1 high cycle fatigue damage assessment for the generated and measured stress signals σ t t 0 t the rainflow counting method is used to get all the stress cycles with their ranges denoted by s i i 1 2 n then the accumulated fatigue damage d t during the time period 0 t is estimated by the palmgren miner rule 23 d t i 1 n s c f s i k α where the parameters of the one slope s n curve are chosen as α 1 0e12 67 and k 3 while the structural stress concentration factor scf is set to 1 27 according to dnv gl 2015 for the chosen structural detail its nominal structural stress signals during 2008 were measured by a hull monitoring system mao et al 2012 referred as the measured stress here in addition the encountered wave conditions are also extracted from the ecmwf hindcast era5 dataset based on the ship s sailing courses in 2008 in order to study the variation of encountered wave conditions in the same sailing area the wave conditions are obtained for the measured ship routes but in different years i e from 2001 to 2015 furthermore the wave conditions are simulated 50 times by the statistical spatio temporal model and the storm model respectively assuming the ship was sailing in the same heading angles and speeds as the measured routes the corresponding structural stress signals are estimated by the proposed approach in section 2 finally the accumulated high cycle fatigue damages during one sailing year caused by the obtained stress signals are estimated by eq 23 fig 15 presents both the mean and 95 confidence interval of the fatigue damages for simulated stresses caused under various wave conditions the fatigue damages estimated from the extracted era wave for the same ship routes agree well with the measured fatigue damages some discrepancies are founded in the first three winter voyages in general the proposed method to simulate a ship s structural stress response in section 2 is accurate to validate the applications of the two statistical wave models for the ship fatigue assessment if the ship is assumed to be sailing in the same routes for other 15 years i e wave conditions from era5 dataset there are large variations of fatigue damage during these years the fatigue damages estimated from the measured stresses are relatively lower in comparison with other years this is because that the ship was assisted by a weather routing system to avoid harsh weather environment during her sailing in open sea mao et al 2012 but the weather routing service in the first voyage during 2008 was not efficient as also indicated in fig 5 left plot in the first voyage the ship was sailing in a very southward course but still encountered three big storms this fact is also reflected in fig 15 showing that the measured fatigue damages during the first 300 sea states are rather higher than those estimated by other approaches it should be noted that the fatigue damage accumulations during the winter seasons first 1200 sea states are much higher than the rest of the year furthermore the mean and standard deviation of accumulated fatigue damages during 1 year that are estimated from different generated stress signals are presented in table 3 it indicates that both the spatio temporal wave model and the storm model can describe well the wave variation encountered by ships as extracted from the 15 years of hindcast wave information the spatio temporal model can well capture the wave variation among various ship routes in different sailing months the storm model gives conservative predictions of expected damage with wider confidence intervals this can be partially explained by fact that this model does not relay on precise knowledge of the routes and the way storms are distributed along the ship route the storm model can be very useful at design stage when ship routes are uncertain the spatio temporal model could be used to predict the accumulated damage for given routes e g help to plan a ship s navigation paths in the future these two models will be combined to provide wave information for ship design but considering a ship s practical navigations during her service time 5 2 crack propagation analysis the two statistical wave models can be used to simulate ship stress signals and model the overall variation of stresses during a ship s service time as demonstrated in the above subsection furthermore they can be also used to model the sequential variation of stress signals that are important for e g crack propagation analysis of ship structures in the following the capability to model sequential effect to crack propagation by the two wave models are investigated using the same stress signals presented in fig 15 the structural details are simplified into a well known experimental specimen as in fig 16 the linear elastic fracture mechanics is employed to estimate the crack propagation here in this study in order to consider the crack closure phenomena the crack propagation curve i e the paris law paris and erdogan 1963 is modified according to newman 1992 as follows 24 d a d n c δ k e f f m 1 δ k e f f t h δ k e f f 1 δ k max η 2 when δ k e f f δ k e f f t h 0 otherwise δ k e f f k m a x k o p e n where the material parameters are obtained from the japanese ship research report sr219 with c 2 60e 11 m 2 75 η 590 m p a m 1 2 and the effective threshold stress intensity factor range δk eff th 2 00 m p a m 1 2 in the analysis the critical step is to get the maximum stress intensity factor k max and the opening stress intensity factor k open of stress cycles that depends on the structural and crack details as well as the given stress cycle in this study those values are estimated by fastran ii newman 1992 in order to validate the crack propagation analysis by the fastran code the experimental tests of the same specimen as in fig 16 under a sequence of clustered loading and varying the mean stress level every 10 clustered loadings as fig 17 left plot are employed the observed crack propagation is compared with that estimated by the fastran code is presented in fig 17 right plot it shows that even under the same stress signals the crack propagation behaves different in the experimental results due to stress sequential effect to the structural crack growth the results of crack growth from fastran analysis agree well with the experimental results therefore fastran is used for the following fatigue crack propagation analysis by means of the fastran analysis the crack propagations of the structural details under the same stress signals as in fig 15 are presented in fig 18 the total crack growth during 1 year under those stresses is also listed in table 3 it confirmed the benefits of using a weather routing service to avoid encountering harsh sea environments the crack propagation due to measured stress is almost the lowest among all crack growth results the mistakes of weather routing in the first ship route also have very big impact leading to significant crack propagation during this voyage and the crack growth rate during this voyage is much higher than those estimated using other years wave conditions the seasonal impact to crack propagation is even more obvious than the high cycle fatigue accumulation i e the observed crack growth is almost stopped in the summer voyages the stress signals generated from the storm model make a slightly faster crack growth propagation than those from the spatio temporal model and era5 during the 1 year sailing the right plot of fig 18 shows the mean and 95 confidence interval of crack propagation as errorbars during this one year s sailing in general both the spatio temporal wave model and the storm model are capable to reproduce the stochastic nature of wave environments along arbitrary ship routes and can be used to estimate the crack propagation with acceptable agreement 6 conclusions conventional fatigue design of ship structures strongly depends on the reliable description of long term wave environments encountered by the ship in this study two statistical wave models are briefly presented and their applications to generate stress signals for ship fatigue assessment are demonstrated the full scale measurements of a 2800teu containership including stress signals ship routes encountered wave conditions sailing speed and heading angles etc are used to investigate their capabilities of modelling wave environments encountered by ships through the comparison of the long term distribution of h s obtained from various approaches it is concluded that the actual wave environments encountered by the ship differ significantly from the wave scatter diagram provided by class guidelines for ship fatigue design the difference can easily lead to 100 overestimation of fatigue damage from class guidelines furthermore today s onboard wave radar sensor can provide rough approximation of a ship s encountered sea conditions but the measured significant wave height may contain large errors in comparison with the hindcast wave data in particular at harsh sea environments however the two statistical wave models can well describe the wave statistics of the ship s encountered sea environments in addition the spatio temporal wave model can describe the wave correlation in both space and time it can be used to simulate wave environments along arbitrary ship routes and interpolate missing wave measurement for chosen ship routes both wave models can be used to estimate the stress signals of ship structural details and subsequently analyze the fatigue damage accumulation along specific ship voyages the statistical scatter of the analyzed fatigue damage based on the two wave models can also reflect the actual fatigue damage scatter that estimated from the 15 years of hindcast wave data moreover the stress sequential effects on a ship s crack propagation due to the temporal variation of encountered sea states and the corresponding stress response can also be modelled by the two wave models their capability is validated by the crack propagation analysis using the measured stress signals the study shows that the two wave models have the potential to be applicable and useful for enhanced and more realistic fatigue life prediction of ship structures

22604,this paper presents a dual buoyancy driven mechanism for petrel x a full ocean depth glider to adjust its buoyancy and pitch angle simultaneously the proposed dynamic model is derived from the newton euler formulation by integrating the influences of environmental parameters and change in displaced volume of the glider the adaptive buoyancy adjustment and the subsequent motion performances are investigated the adaptive buoyancy adjustment is realized by adopting the passive buoyancy compensation to maintain neutral buoyancy and using the dual buoyancy driven mechanism to adjust the buoyancy actively the coefficient of deep contraction is defined to describe the ability of maintaining neutral buoyancy and determine the optimal quantity of the passive buoyancy compensators with the proposed approach the net buoyancy variation in the full ocean depth decreases by 70 8 the motion is simulated based on the dynamic model the simulation data are analyzed with the neural network trained by the bayesian regularization backpropagation algorithm to guide the parameter settings for the sea trials in april 2018 the petrel x glider was deployed in the mariana trench which dived down to 8213 m the agreement between the simulation and experimental results confirms the feasibility of the proposed methods keywords underwater glider dual buoyancy driven mechanism adaptive buoyancy adjustment neutral buoyancy dynamic model 1 introduction the global oceans are classified into five depth zones sublittoral 300 m upper bathyal 300 800 m lower bathyal 800 3500 m abyssal 3500 6500 m and hadal 6500 m according to the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco 2009 the deep ocean in this paper refers to the abyssal and hadal zones the abyssal and hadal zones translate to 65 4 and 0 21 of the total area of the global ocean watling et al 2013 although the hadal zone takes up a small percentage of the total area it accounts for 41 of the full ocean depth compared with the plenty of data collected in sublittoral and bathyal ocean zones limited data have been collected in the deep ocean jamieson 2015 jamieson 2018 thought that compact affordable and innovative platforms needed to be developed to realize chronical and extensive observations in the hadal zone underwater gliders are easy to use and cost effective mobile platforms that follow sawtooth paths to monitor the physical chemical biological and geological parameters of seawater wang and yang 2018 they have received increasing attention and shown their significance for cost saving long term and large scale observations of the sublittoral and upper bathyal zones liblik et al 2016 nowadays several deep sea gliders have been developed such as the deepglider osse and eriksen 2007 the ultradeep explorer glider bridges 2016 and the petrel 4000 glider their maximum working depths are 6000 m 5000 m and 4000 m respectively these gliders cannot dive to the hadal zone and fully explore the abyssal areas there are three main challenges faced by these gliders in improving their working depths firstly an accurate quantitative method is further needed for adjusting the buoyancy of the glider to adapt the buoyancy changes from the surface to the hadal zone secondly these gliders generally adjust the pitch angle of the glider by moving the internal batteries which results in limited adjustment range in the hadal zone thirdly at present their pressure housings fail to resist the hydrostatic pressure of seawater beyond their maximum working depths an innovative underwater glider petrel x is developed to provide the oceanographic community a compact platform to realize abyssal and hadal observations to deal with the challenges above this study adopts three measures for the petrel x glider firstly the passive buoyancy compensators are proposed and analyzed quantificationally to adaptively adjust the buoyancy of the glider and offset the influence of the density change from surface to the hadal zone further the dual buoyancy driven mechanisms is developed to adjust the buoyancy and pitch attitude of the glider simultaneously which enhances the adjustment ability of the glider finally we adopt glass spheres as the pressure housings due to their immense strength to weight ratio low cost high transparency and wide applications in the deep ocean pausch et al 2009 bhatta and leonard 2008 discussed the longitudinal dynamic model of an underwater glider hussain et al 2011 described the modeling and analysis of the net buoyancy depth and pitch angle adjustment for an underwater glider abraham and yi 2015 developed the flight dynamics of the slocum glider to study the predictive control all of these models neglect the impacts of the seawater in the glider fairing on the motion and they cannot compute the net buoyancy variation of the entire glider accurately additionally they are not suitable for analyzing the motion of the full ocean depth glider with the new method of attitude adjustment tang et al 2018 developed a method to optimize the structures of the cylinder pressure hulls of the glider for passive buoyancy compensation this method can only be applied to the cylinder pressure hulls made of metal which is not suitable for the glider working in the hadal zone where the metal cylinder pressure hulls would be too heavy phillips et al 2012 discussed the possibility of adding the compensation liquid to make the underwater vehicle maintain neutral buoyancy their method fails to determine the optimal quantity of the compensation liquid and quantificationally analyze the volume variation of the compensation liquid caused by depth changes to our knowledge there is little published research on the evaluation criterion to estimate the ability of an underwater vehicle for maintaining neutral buoyancy besides most previous studies neglect the influences of the temperature changes of seawater and other parts of the underwater vehicle on the net buoyancy variation of the entire vehicle with the depth change 2 dynamic model for the glider the structure and the main specifications of the glider are presented in fig 1 and table 1 respectively three reference frames are defined to describe the motion of the glider based on fossen s definitions fossen 2011 as shown in fig 2 firstly the inertial frame n o n x n y n z n is defined relative to the earth s reference ellipsoid the starting point of the glider motion is chosen as the origin o n the x n axis points north the y n axis points upward normal to the earth s surface the z n axis points east secondly the body frame b o b x b y b z b is defined as a moving frame fixed on the glider the origin o b is chosen as the projection of the buoyancy center of the glider onto its longitudinal axis when it is neutrally buoyant and level with the horizontal plane on the sea surface the x b axis is defined along the longitudinal axis directing from aft to fore the y b axis is normal to the horizontal wings of the glider directing from bottom to top the z b axis directs to starboard lastly the flow frame f o f x f y f z f is founded by rotating the body frame to make the x f axis parallel to the velocity of the glider when the body frame is rotated relative to the z b axis by the angle α atk the y b axis is rotated to a new position which is defined as the y f axis the z f axis is defined as x f y f the relation between the coordinates of the vector in the inertial frame and the body frame is given by the transformation of coordinates v c b r bn v c n the coordinate transformation matrix has the form of 1 r bn c θ c ψ s θ c θ s ψ s θ c ψ c φ s ψ s φ c θ c φ s θ s ψ c φ c ψ s φ s θ c ψ s φ s ψ c φ c θ s φ s θ s ψ s φ c ψ c φ where s sin and c cos similarly the relation between the coordinates of the vector in the flow frame and the body frame is given by the transformation of coordinates v c b r bf v c f the coordinate transformation matrix has the form of 2 r bf c α atk c β sld s α atk c α atk s β sld c β sld s α atk c α atk s α atk s β sld s β sld 0 c β sld the system of interest is determined by a boundary surface and its contents the outside surface of the glider fairing is chosen as the boundary surface of the system seawater can enter or leave the system through the boundary the contents inside the boundary consist of the glider components and seawater inside the glider fairing the selection of the system under study avoids the description of the forces acting on the glider which are exerted by the seawater inside the boundary as the depth increases the water volumes displaced by the glider components decrease which leads to the increase of the seawater volume inside the boundary besides the density of seawater increases with the depth thus the mass of the seawater inside the boundary increases with the depth this makes the mass of the system variable and a function of depth considering that the motion analysis here mainly concerns gliding and steering performances two hypotheses are made to simplify the dynamic model and analyze the motion more efficiently firstly the velocity of the glider relative to the seawater is slow the change rate of the displaced volume of the glider is small and the change rate of the seawater density is also small thus the complex additional forces and moments exerted by these are neglected secondly the positions of the gravity center and buoyancy center of the glider are variable relative to the body frame during drawing in and draining out oil but these stages are relatively short compared with the whole motion process of the glider this paper mainly focuses on the average performances of the whole motion process thus these complex stages are neglected when studying the gliding and steering performances of the glider therefore the positions of the gravity center and buoyancy center of the glider are considered to be approximately fixed in the body frame and the complex additional forces and moments exerted by the movement of the hydraulic oil between the external bladders and the internal reservoirs are neglected based on the hypotheses above the form of the motion equations of the system is similar to the ones described by fossen 2011 however the mass coordinates of the gravity center and the inertia matrix of the system in the equations are functions of depth the motion equations are derived by using the newton euler formulation and vectorial mechanics mentioned in fossen s study fossen 2011 the kinematic equations of motion are derived from the transformation of coordinates and the euler kinematic equations they are written as 3 x n u cos θ cos ψ v sin ψ sin φ sin θ cos ψ cos φ w sin ψ cos φ sin θ cos ψ sin φ y

equations of motion are derived from the euler s first and second axioms the vectorial form is written as 4 m d v ob d t ω v ob ε r g ω ω r g g b f t f viscous f inertia i b ε ω i b ω m r g d v ob d t

simulate the motion of the system the mechanical parameters of the system and the forces and moments acting on the system are described the mass and inertia matrix of the entire system are written as 6 m m glider m sea m glider ρ sea g v v glider i b i glider b i sea b i glider b ρ sea g i v b i glider v b where i v b is the moment of inertia of the equivalent system that involves only seawater with the same displaced volume and i glider v b is the moment of inertia of the equivalent glider that involves only seawater with the same displaced volume the mechanical parameters of the glider the seawater inside the fairing and the entire system when the glider is in the initial state on the sea surface are listed in table 2 three kinds of forces and moments act on the system the conservative forces and moments the hydrodynamic forces and moments and the propeller thrust and moment as shown in fig 2 the conservative forces and moments acting on the glider include gravity buoyancy and their moments relative to origin o b of the body frame they are analyzed in section 3 the hydrodynamic forces the propeller thrust and their moments relative to origin o b of the body frame are analyzed in section 4 3 net buoyancy analysis and adaptive buoyancy adjustment the net buoyancy acting on the system the resultant force of gravity and buoyancy is discussed in this section the net buoyancy of the glider provides the propulsion which is affected significantly by the environmental parameters the buoyancy of the glider depends on the density of the surrounding seawater and the displaced volume of the glider which is further affected by the pressure and temperature of seawater 3 1 description of the environmental parameters the hydrostatic pressure of seawater increases with the depth theoretically it is 102 95 mpa 103 52 mpa at the depth of 10 000 m from the equator to the polar region based on the conversion eq 7 the relation between the hydrostatic pressure and the depth is described by saunders 1981 as 7 p sea 1 5 92 10 3 5 25 10 3 sin 2 φ lat 1 5 92 10 3 5 25 10 3 sin 2 φ lat 2 8 84 10 6 h 4 42 10 6 where φ lat is the latitude according to the full ocean depth ctd data available from japan oceanographic data center taira et al 2005 the temperature and density of seawater at different depths are studied the dataset was observed by the ctd cast deployed at 11 22 78 n and 142 34 95 e on december first 1992 it can be downloaded from the serial station data of japan oceanographic data center 1992 the temperature of seawater decreases with the increasing depth in the sublittoral and bathyal zones and then increases slightly in the abyssal and hadal zones in the full ocean depth the relation between the temperature and depth is fitted as 8 t sea 18 62 exp h 7 318

increases with depth significantly in the deep ocean in the full ocean depth the relation between the density and depth is fitted as 9 ρ sea 1106 exp h 2 575 10 4 8 768 10 4 2 3 533 exp h 662 7 2099 2

maintain neutral buoyancy which measures the relative volume change of a fluid or solid in response to the depth change based on the definition of the compressibility and the volume expansion coefficient yunus and cimbala 2006 the coefficient of deep contraction is expressed as 10 ε dep 1 v d v d h d p 0 p h β pre d p sea t 0 t h α tem d t sea d h β pre d p sea d h α tem d t sea d h where p 0 and t 0 are the pressure and temperature of seawater on the surface and p h and t h are the pressure and temperature of seawater at the depth h to analyze the variation of the net buoyancy the petrel x glider is divided into several parts whose total number is n then the net buoyancy of the glider at the depth h is given by 11 n b glider h ρ sea g v glider m glider g g ρ sea 0 i 1 n v i 0 exp 0 h ε dep sea ε dep i d x 1 where ρ sea 0 is the density of seawater on the surface v i 0 the displaced volume of the ith part of the glider on the surface ε dep i and ε dep sea the coefficients of deep contraction of the ith part of the glider and seawater respectively then the variation range of the net buoyancy of the glider within the whole range of the full ocean depth is used to describe the ability of the glider to maintain neutral buoyancy to illustrate the influence of the passive buoyancy compensators the net buoyancy of the glider not equipped with the compensators is analyzed first based on elastic mechanics analysis of the sphere pressure housing its compressibility under external pressure is written as 12 β pre sph 1 v sph v sph p sea 3 c 1 p sea where c 1 e sph k 3 1 1 2 μ sph k 3 0 5 1 μ sph and k d o d i e sph and μ sph are the elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of the material of the sphere pressure housing d o and d i are external and internal diameters of the sphere pressure housing respectively according to the dimensions of internal components the external diameters of corresponding glass sphere pressure housings are chosen as 432 mm and 187 mm by substituting the parameters into eq 12 the compressibility of these two kinds of glass sphere pressure housings is written as β pre sph 1 3 15984 p sea and β pre sph 2 3 25055 p sea respectively based on similar elastic mechanics analysis the deformation and displaced volume of the sphere pressure housing are computed the volume expansion coefficient of the sphere pressure housing is written as 13 α tem sph 1 v sph v sph t sea 3 γ sph 1 γ sph δ t sea where γ sph is the linear expansion coefficient of the material of the sphere pressure housing and δ t sea the seawater temperature difference between the surface and the depth h for the glass sphere pressure housings the coefficients of volume expansion are written as α tem sph 1 α tem sph 2 9 9 3 3 t sea 1 0 10 6 based on the bulk modulus data of hydraulic oil from castrol limited 2010 the compressibility of hydraulic oil in the external bladders and the pressure balanced junction box is fitted as β pre ho 0 1039 p sea 169 5 since the compressibility and volume expansion coefficient of solids vary little as the pressure and temperature change they are hypothesized to be approximately constant the thermophysical properties of the materials ashby 2017 carvill 1993 castrol limited 2010 kutz 2015 oberg et al 2016 are shown in table 3 the coefficient of deep contraction and the net buoyancy of the glider not equipped with the compensators are computed and shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively 3 3 optimization of passive buoyancy compensators when the glider is not equipped with the passive buoyancy compensators its net buoyancy varies from 125 5 n to 83 7 n as the depth increases from 0 m to 10 000 m and the variation range is 41 8 n which is shown in fig 4 the reason for this variation is that the coefficient of deep contraction of the glider not equipped with the compensators is smaller than that of seawater as shown in fig 3 to reduce the variation range of the buoyancy the glider is equipped with the passive buoyancy compensators consisting of several bladders filled with the liquid whose coefficient of deep contraction is larger than that of seawater some liquids have larger coefficients of deep contraction than that of seawater such as pentane hexane decane mineral oil paraffin and silicon oil among these pentane and hexane are flammable decane is harmful the phase of the paraffin may change with temperature and mineral oil has a larger density and smaller compressibility than silicon oil phillips et al 2012 therefore silicon oil is selected as the passive buoyancy compensation liquid for the petrel x glider besides silicon oil provides extra net buoyancy for the glider this liquid does not absorb water so its buoyancy maintains constant on the sea surface for a long time which makes it an ideal buoyancy material in comparison the water absorption of syntactic foams makes the net buoyancy decrease in long term underwater applications the density of silicon oil at different pressures was measured by an oscillating u tube system produced by anton parr the relation between its density and the pressure is fitted as 14 ρ c 0 003661 p sea 2 1 184 p sea 781 2 because the compressibility of silicon oil changes little when the temperature varies from 0 c to 30 c it is hypothesized to be a function of the pressure but independent of the temperature the compressibility of silicon oil is given by 15 β pre c 1 ρ c d ρ c d p sea 2 p sea 323 4 p sea 2 323 4 p sea 213400 the volume expansion coefficient of silicon oil changes little as the temperature varies from 0 c to 30 c and the pressure varies from 0 mpa to 103 mpa which is therefore hypothesized to be approximately constant the density of silicon oil at 2 c and 25 c was measured its volume expansion coefficient is given by 16 α tem c ln 758 368 781 053 2 25 1 281 10 3 c 1 the coefficient of deep contraction of compensators is computed and shown in fig 3 the net buoyancy of the glider equipped with compensators is computed and shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 3 the coefficient of deep contraction of the glider not equipped with the compensators is smaller than that of seawater while that of compensators is larger this makes the coefficient of deep contraction of the glider equipped with the compensators closer to that of seawater which keeps the glider near neutrally buoyant the total volume of the passive compensation liquid is optimized to get the minimum variation range of the net buoyancy and the optimal volume is 48 6 l with this volume the net buoyancy of the glider equipped with the compensators varies from 12 2 n to 0 n so the minimum variation range is 12 2 n as shown in fig 4 this contributes to a 70 8 decrease of the variation range of the net buoyancy from 0 m to 10 000 m which makes the glider maintain near neutral buoyancy and the buoyancy driven mechanism can conserve considerable energy to enlarge the endurance of the glider 4 hydrodynamic analysis the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the glider include viscous ones and inertial ones viscous hydrodynamic forces and moments relative to origin o f of the flow frame are described by their relations with the corresponding kinematic variables based on bhatta s expressions bhatta 2006 and the hydrodynamic analysis of the petrel x glider these forces and moments are written in the flow frame as 17 d f 0

turning down in the vertical plane and 30 m 570 m turning left in the horizontal plane or turning up in the vertical plane the mesh generating method and the model set up of the cfd analysis here are similar to those of the static ones the added momentum sources are integrated into the cfd solver through user defined functions udfs in the rotary cases based on the method proposed by hu and lin 2008 the simulation data are used to fit the hydrodynamic coefficients related to the corresponding velocity variables based on eq 17 the fitted coefficients are listed in table 6 the coordinates of the viscous hydrodynamic forces and moments in the body frame are computed from the ones in the flow frame according to eq 2 the coordinate transformation matrix they are written as 18 x b d f cos β

moments relative to origin o b are expressed in the body frame shown in eq 19 based on fossen s expressions fossen 2011 the inertial hydrodynamic coefficients also called the added mass are computed by the strip theory and panel method the main body and wings are treated as equivalent ellipsoid and panels to compute their added mass then the added mass of the entire glider is determined according to the superposition principle the computational results are listed in table 6 19 g 1 g 2 g 3 g 4 g 5 g 6 λ 11 0 0 0 0 0 0 λ 22 0 0 0 λ 26 0 0 λ 33 λ 34 λ 35 0 0 0 λ 43 λ 44 λ 45 0 0 0 λ 53 λ 54 λ 55

dual buoyancy driven mechanism adjusts the pitch angle and the net buoyancy of the glider at the same time at the beginning of a profile or when encountering the ocean currents the dual propeller propulsive mechanism adjusts the heading of the glider to a target direction the simulator for calculating the motion variables with the given target parameters is established by solving the motion equations of the system with the runge kutta numerical method dormand and prince 1980 shampine and reichelt 1997 the gliding performances in the vertical plane and the steering performances in the horizontal plane are predicted by the simulator and verified by the sea experiments the main variables for controlling the motion of the glider are the target depth the speeds of the two propellers and the driven volumes of oil in fore external bladder for diving aft external bladder for diving fore external bladder for climbing and aft external bladder for climbing the volume range of the oil in each external bladder is 1 l 6 l and the maximum driven volume in each external bladder is 5 l when the glider is on the surface where the density of seawater is 1022 kg m3 the driven volume of oil in each external bladder is set as 3 5 l and when the glider is entirely underwater some ballast weights are allocated at the proper locations to keep the glider neutrally buoyant on the sea surface and level with the horizontal plane when the fore and aft external bladders hold 3 45 l and 5 15 l oil respectively the satellite antenna and the top of the glider emerge out of seawater to communicate with the satellite according to the density computed from the data collected by the onboard ctd the driven volumes of oil in the fore and aft external bladders are adjusted automatically once in each profile when the glider is on the surface this function is designed to keep the antenna high enough to adapt the density variation of seawater on the surface 5 1 gliding performances with the given target depth and driven volume of oil in each external bladder motion variables such as the angle of attack glide angle pitch angle vertical velocity glide velocity duration and voyage of the glider within a single profile are computed by using the simulator the ranges of the average pitch angle and the average glide velocity are computed by using the genetic algorithm goldberg et al 1989 the ranges of the average pitch angles for diving and climbing are 60 0 0 and 0 61 6 respectively the ranges of the average glide velocities for diving and climbing are 0 m s 0 86 m s and 0 m s 1 01 m s respectively within a profile the relation between the average diving pitch angle average diving vertical velocity target depth and driven volume of oil in each external bladder is fitted by the two layer feed forward neural network with 200 sigmoid symmetric hidden neurons and linear output neurons trained by the bayesian regularization backpropagation algorithm foresee and hagan 1997 the diving function v bd 1 v bd 2 t f d d tar θ d tar v ver d tar t is a solver for the desired driven volumes of oil for diving with the target variables similarly the climbing function v bu 1 v bu 2 t f u d tar θ u tar v ver u tar t is a solver for the desired driven volumes of oil for climbing the relative errors of the fittings are less than 0 07 substituting the target inputs into the diving and climbing functions gives the setting values of the driven volume of oil in each external bladder when the target depth is 8000 m diving pitch angle 23 diving vertical velocity 0 25 m s climbing pitch angle 23 and climbing vertical velocity 0 25 m s corresponding driven volumes of oil in fore external bladder for diving aft external bladder for diving fore external bladder for climbing and aft external bladder for climbing are 1 977 l 1 898 l 4 854 l and 5 948 l respectively the time step for the simulation is set as 1 second and the simulation results are shown in fig 7 as mentioned in section 2 the beginning stage and the stage near the maximum depth are relatively short in the whole profile here we mainly focus on the average pitch angle and average vertical velocity of the whole profile thus these complex and short stages are neglected during the simulation to simplify the dynamic model and reduce the computing burden in april 2018 the petrel x glider was launched in the mariana trench see fig 6 the deepest depth that the glider dived to was 8213 m which is the deepest working depth that an underwater glider has ever reached in the sea trial to our knowledge during the sea trial the gliding performances of the glider were tested the time step for recording data during the test was set as 5 seconds to save the memory capacity of the controller for the deepest profile the setting values of the driven volumes of oil were the same as those for the simulation above the test data of the depth pitch angle and vertical velocity are shown in fig 7 together with the simulation results the actual average pitch angles for diving and climbing were 21 4 and 21 0 respectively the actual average vertical velocities for diving and climbing were 0 275 m s and 0 252 m s respectively the test results of the sea trials indicate that the actual gliding performances basically match the simulation which demonstrates the feasibility of the adaptive buoyancy adjustment method the pitch adjustment method through the dual buoyancy driven mechanism the dynamic model and the simulator the pump module is the kernel of the hydraulic drive unit its energy consumption accounts for a large proportion of the total energy consumption of the glider its performances were tested with different outlet pressures and pump speeds the pump volumetric efficiency mechanical efficiency and total efficiency with different outlet pressures and pump speeds are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the total efficiency of the pump increases with the outlet pressure when the latter is lower than 50 mpa then it stays almost constant between 45 and 50 when the outlet pressure is larger than 50 mpa it can be concluded that the working efficiency of the pump in deep waters is generally higher than that in shallow waters under the torque constraint of the motor for the pump the maximum pump speed is set as 1114 rpm at high pressure the relation between the input power of the pump and outlet pressure is fitted as 21 p pi 147 8 exp p sea 132 1 96 57 2 the relation between the flow rate of the pump and outlet pressure is fitted as 22 q p 50 13 0 002526 p sea 0 9943 the input power and working hours of the pump solenoid valves control boards sensors and antennas are computed then the energy consumption of the glider within a single profile is computed with the driven volumes of oil and the target depth the corresponding available profiles duration and voyage are computed with the capacity limitation of the battery pack when the target depth is 10 000 m and the absolute value of the average vertical velocity is larger than 0 05 m s the longest voyage is computed by using the genetic algorithm goldberg et al 1989 the optimal driven volumes of oil in the fore external bladder for diving aft external bladder for diving fore external bladder for climbing and aft external bladder for climbing are 2 618 l 2 796 l 4 127 l and 3 808 l respectively the longest voyage is 1749 km and the corresponding duration is 82 days 5 2 steering performances due to the difficulty in accurate underwater positioning the glider is set to sail on the sea surface to evaluate its steering performances with accurate gps positioning through using the simulator motion variables such as the linear velocity yaw angular velocity and turning radius of the glider are computed with the given propeller speed with the same speed of the two propellers the glider sails along a straight line the relation between the propulsion velocity and propeller speed is fitted as v t 0 0264 n p when the propeller speed is 2500 rpm the maximum propulsion velocity of the glider is 1 1 m s when the propeller speed is 500 rpm 2500 rpm the relations between the turning radius and angular rate of the glider with propeller speed are fitted as r g 1 69 n p 21 9 and q g 1 80 10 4 n p 2 0 0162 n p 0 142 respectively the minimum turning radius is 36 m and the maximum turning angular rate is 0 51 s the steering performances were simulated when the speed of the right propeller is 1500 rpm and the time step for the simulation is set as 1 second as shown in fig 9 the steering performances were tested during the sea trial in coastal waters of qingdao in march 2018 the speed of the right propeller was the same as the simulation and the time step for recording data during the test was set as 8 seconds to give the antenna enough time for successful gps positioning the actual turning radius was 70 m close to the simulated one of 64 m the average actual turning angular rate was 0 49 s close to the simulated one of 0 43 s the agreement between the simulation and test result proves the feasibility of the dynamic model and the simulator 6 conclusions this paper has described the dynamic modeling and motion analysis for a dual buoyancy driven full ocean depth glider by considering the environmental parameters and corresponding displaced volume change of the entire glider the analysis of the adaptive buoyancy adjustment was conducted and the net buoyancy variation decreased by up to 70 8 through using the passive buoyancy compensators the presented method to make the glider maintain neutral buoyancy can reduce the energy consumption of the dual buoyancy driven mechanism and extend the working depth and endurance the consistency of the simulation and sea trials validates the effectiveness of the adaptive buoyancy adjustment method and the derived dynamic model the proposed methods and model can also be applied to other deep sea underwater vehicles although the maximum test depth of 8213 m in the mariana trench has not yet reached the design depth we believe that the petrel x glider will achieve this design goal with more sea trial opportunities further studies need to be carried out to improve the method of energy consumption management to extend the duration and voyage of the glider several motion patterns can be realized by the petrel x glider such as gliding along a sawtooth path to survey a transection or a grid hovering as a virtual mooring for station keeping and moving toward a region for tracking an oceanographic feature automatically in the future the petrel x glider will be integrated with more oceanographic instruments additionally a fleet of petrel x gliders can survey different regions simultaneously to monitor large areas faster and the collected data can be used to build a spatiotemporal database of the deep ocean with high spatial and temporal resolution acknowledgments the authors are grateful for the support from national key

22604,this paper presents a dual buoyancy driven mechanism for petrel x a full ocean depth glider to adjust its buoyancy and pitch angle simultaneously the proposed dynamic model is derived from the newton euler formulation by integrating the influences of environmental parameters and change in displaced volume of the glider the adaptive buoyancy adjustment and the subsequent motion performances are investigated the adaptive buoyancy adjustment is realized by adopting the passive buoyancy compensation to maintain neutral buoyancy and using the dual buoyancy driven mechanism to adjust the buoyancy actively the coefficient of deep contraction is defined to describe the ability of maintaining neutral buoyancy and determine the optimal quantity of the passive buoyancy compensators with the proposed approach the net buoyancy variation in the full ocean depth decreases by 70 8 the motion is simulated based on the dynamic model the simulation data are analyzed with the neural network trained by the bayesian regularization backpropagation algorithm to guide the parameter settings for the sea trials in april 2018 the petrel x glider was deployed in the mariana trench which dived down to 8213 m the agreement between the simulation and experimental results confirms the feasibility of the proposed methods keywords underwater glider dual buoyancy driven mechanism adaptive buoyancy adjustment neutral buoyancy dynamic model 1 introduction the global oceans are classified into five depth zones sublittoral 300 m upper bathyal 300 800 m lower bathyal 800 3500 m abyssal 3500 6500 m and hadal 6500 m according to the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco 2009 the deep ocean in this paper refers to the abyssal and hadal zones the abyssal and hadal zones translate to 65 4 and 0 21 of the total area of the global ocean watling et al 2013 although the hadal zone takes up a small percentage of the total area it accounts for 41 of the full ocean depth compared with the plenty of data collected in sublittoral and bathyal ocean zones limited data have been collected in the deep ocean jamieson 2015 jamieson 2018 thought that compact affordable and innovative platforms needed to be developed to realize chronical and extensive observations in the hadal zone underwater gliders are easy to use and cost effective mobile platforms that follow sawtooth paths to monitor the physical chemical biological and geological parameters of seawater wang and yang 2018 they have received increasing attention and shown their significance for cost saving long term and large scale observations of the sublittoral and upper bathyal zones liblik et al 2016 nowadays several deep sea gliders have been developed such as the deepglider osse and eriksen 2007 the ultradeep explorer glider bridges 2016 and the petrel 4000 glider their maximum working depths are 6000 m 5000 m and 4000 m respectively these gliders cannot dive to the hadal zone and fully explore the abyssal areas there are three main challenges faced by these gliders in improving their working depths firstly an accurate quantitative method is further needed for adjusting the buoyancy of the glider to adapt the buoyancy changes from the surface to the hadal zone secondly these gliders generally adjust the pitch angle of the glider by moving the internal batteries which results in limited adjustment range in the hadal zone thirdly at present their pressure housings fail to resist the hydrostatic pressure of seawater beyond their maximum working depths an innovative underwater glider petrel x is developed to provide the oceanographic community a compact platform to realize abyssal and hadal observations to deal with the challenges above this study adopts three measures for the petrel x glider firstly the passive buoyancy compensators are proposed and analyzed quantificationally to adaptively adjust the buoyancy of the glider and offset the influence of the density change from surface to the hadal zone further the dual buoyancy driven mechanisms is developed to adjust the buoyancy and pitch attitude of the glider simultaneously which enhances the adjustment ability of the glider finally we adopt glass spheres as the pressure housings due to their immense strength to weight ratio low cost high transparency and wide applications in the deep ocean pausch et al 2009 bhatta and leonard 2008 discussed the longitudinal dynamic model of an underwater glider hussain et al 2011 described the modeling and analysis of the net buoyancy depth and pitch angle adjustment for an underwater glider abraham and yi 2015 developed the flight dynamics of the slocum glider to study the predictive control all of these models neglect the impacts of the seawater in the glider fairing on the motion and they cannot compute the net buoyancy variation of the entire glider accurately additionally they are not suitable for analyzing the motion of the full ocean depth glider with the new method of attitude adjustment tang et al 2018 developed a method to optimize the structures of the cylinder pressure hulls of the glider for passive buoyancy compensation this method can only be applied to the cylinder pressure hulls made of metal which is not suitable for the glider working in the hadal zone where the metal cylinder pressure hulls would be too heavy phillips et al 2012 discussed the possibility of adding the compensation liquid to make the underwater vehicle maintain neutral buoyancy their method fails to determine the optimal quantity of the compensation liquid and quantificationally analyze the volume variation of the compensation liquid caused by depth changes to our knowledge there is little published research on the evaluation criterion to estimate the ability of an underwater vehicle for maintaining neutral buoyancy besides most previous studies neglect the influences of the temperature changes of seawater and other parts of the underwater vehicle on the net buoyancy variation of the entire vehicle with the depth change 2 dynamic model for the glider the structure and the main specifications of the glider are presented in fig 1 and table 1 respectively three reference frames are defined to describe the motion of the glider based on fossen s definitions fossen 2011 as shown in fig 2 firstly the inertial frame n o n x n y n z n is defined relative to the earth s reference ellipsoid the starting point of the glider motion is chosen as the origin o n the x n axis points north the y n axis points upward normal to the earth s surface the z n axis points east secondly the body frame b o b x b y b z b is defined as a moving frame fixed on the glider the origin o b is chosen as the projection of the buoyancy center of the glider onto its longitudinal axis when it is neutrally buoyant and level with the horizontal plane on the sea surface the x b axis is defined along the longitudinal axis directing from aft to fore the y b axis is normal to the horizontal wings of the glider directing from bottom to top the z b axis directs to starboard lastly the flow frame f o f x f y f z f is founded by rotating the body frame to make the x f axis parallel to the velocity of the glider when the body frame is rotated relative to the z b axis by the angle α atk the y b axis is rotated to a new position which is defined as the y f axis the z f axis is defined as x f y f the relation between the coordinates of the vector in the inertial frame and the body frame is given by the transformation of coordinates v c b r bn

contents the outside surface of the glider fairing is chosen as the boundary surface of the system seawater can enter or leave the system through the boundary the contents inside the boundary consist of the glider components and seawater inside the glider fairing the selection of the system under study avoids the description of the forces acting on the glider which are exerted by the seawater inside the boundary as the depth increases the water volumes displaced by the glider components decrease which leads to the increase of the seawater volume inside the boundary besides the density of seawater increases with the depth thus the mass of the seawater inside the boundary increases with the depth this makes the mass of the system variable and a function of depth considering that the motion analysis here mainly concerns gliding and steering performances two hypotheses are made to simplify the dynamic model and analyze the motion more efficiently firstly the velocity of the glider relative to the seawater is slow the change rate of the displaced volume of the glider is small and the change rate of the seawater density is also small thus the complex additional forces and moments exerted by these are neglected secondly the positions of the gravity center and buoyancy center of the glider are variable relative to the body frame during drawing in and draining out oil but these stages are relatively short compared with the whole motion process of the glider this paper mainly focuses on the average performances of the whole motion process thus these complex stages are neglected when studying the gliding and steering performances of the glider therefore the positions of the gravity center and buoyancy center of the glider are considered to be approximately fixed in the body frame and the complex additional forces and moments exerted by the movement of the hydraulic oil between the external bladders and the internal reservoirs are neglected based on the hypotheses above the form of the motion equations of the system is similar to the ones described by fossen 2011 however the mass coordinates of the gravity center and the inertia matrix of the system in the equations are functions of depth the motion equations are derived by using the newton euler formulation and vectorial mechanics mentioned in fossen s study fossen 2011 the kinematic equations of motion are derived from the transformation of coordinates and the euler kinematic equations they are written as 3 x n u cos θ cos ψ v sin ψ sin φ sin θ cos ψ cos φ w sin ψ cos φ sin θ cos ψ sin φ y

simulate the motion of the system the mechanical parameters of the system and the forces and moments acting on the system are described the mass and inertia matrix of the entire system are written as 6 m m glider m sea m glider ρ sea g v v glider i b i glider b i sea b i glider b ρ sea g i v b i glider v b where i v b is the moment of inertia of the equivalent system that involves only seawater with the same displaced volume and i glider v b is the moment of inertia of the equivalent glider that involves only seawater with the same displaced volume the mechanical parameters of the glider the seawater inside the fairing and the entire system when the glider is in the initial state on the sea surface are listed in table 2 three kinds of forces and moments act on the system the conservative forces and moments the hydrodynamic forces and moments and the propeller thrust and moment as shown in fig 2 the conservative forces and moments acting on the glider include gravity buoyancy and their moments relative to origin o b of the body frame they are analyzed in section 3 the hydrodynamic forces the propeller thrust and their moments relative to origin o b of the body frame are analyzed in section 4 3 net buoyancy analysis and adaptive buoyancy adjustment the net buoyancy acting on the system the resultant force of gravity and buoyancy is discussed in this section the net buoyancy of the glider provides the propulsion which is affected significantly by the environmental parameters the buoyancy of the glider depends on the density of the surrounding seawater and the displaced volume of the glider which is further affected by the pressure and temperature of seawater 3 1 description of the environmental parameters the hydrostatic pressure of seawater increases with the depth theoretically it is 102 95 mpa 103 52 mpa at the depth of 10 000 m from the equator to the polar region based on the conversion eq 7 the relation between the hydrostatic pressure and the depth is described by saunders 1981 as 7 p sea 1 5 92 10 3 5 25 10 3 sin 2 φ lat 1 5 92 10 3 5 25 10 3 sin 2 φ lat 2 8 84 10 6 h 4 42 10 6 where φ lat is the latitude according to the full ocean depth ctd data available from japan oceanographic data center taira et al 2005 the temperature and density of seawater at different depths are studied the dataset was observed by the ctd cast deployed at 11 22 78 n and 142 34 95 e on december first 1992 it can be downloaded from the serial station data of japan oceanographic data center 1992 the temperature of seawater decreases with the increasing depth in the sublittoral and bathyal zones and then increases slightly in the abyssal and hadal zones in the full ocean depth the relation between the temperature and depth is fitted as 8 t sea 18 62 exp h 7 318 156 2 2 8 049 10 12 exp h 4 536 10 4 8680 2 6 448 10 5 exp h 3 337 10 5 9 126 10 4 2 the density of seawater is calculated according to the method described by fofonoff and millard jr 1983 it increases with depth significantly in the deep ocean in the full ocean depth the relation between the density and depth is fitted as 9 ρ sea 1106 exp h 2 575 10 4 8 768 10 4 2 3 533 exp h 662 7 2099 2

maintain neutral buoyancy which measures the relative volume change of a fluid or solid in response to the depth change based on the definition of the compressibility and the volume expansion coefficient yunus and cimbala 2006 the coefficient of deep contraction is expressed as 10 ε dep 1 v d v d h d p 0 p h β pre d p sea t 0 t h α tem d t sea d h β pre d p sea d h α tem d t sea d h where p 0 and t 0 are the pressure and temperature of seawater on the surface and p h and t h are the pressure and temperature of seawater at the depth h to analyze the variation of the net buoyancy the petrel x glider is divided into several parts whose total number is n then the net buoyancy of the glider at the depth h is given by 11 n b glider h ρ sea g v glider m glider g g ρ sea 0 i 1 n v i 0 exp 0 h ε dep sea ε dep i d x 1 where ρ sea 0 is the density of seawater on the surface v i 0 the displaced volume of the ith part of the glider on the surface ε dep i and ε dep sea the coefficients of deep contraction of the ith part of the glider and seawater respectively then the variation range of the net buoyancy of the glider within the whole range of the full ocean depth is used to describe the ability of the glider to maintain neutral buoyancy to illustrate the influence of the passive buoyancy compensators the net buoyancy of the glider not equipped with the compensators is analyzed first based on elastic mechanics analysis of the sphere pressure housing its compressibility under external pressure is written as 12 β pre sph 1 v sph v sph p sea 3 c 1 p sea where c 1 e sph k 3 1 1 2 μ sph k 3 0 5 1 μ sph and k d o d i e sph and μ sph are the elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of the material of the sphere pressure housing d o and d i are external and internal diameters of the sphere pressure housing respectively according to the dimensions of internal components the external diameters of corresponding glass sphere pressure housings are chosen as 432 mm and 187 mm by substituting the parameters into eq 12 the compressibility of these two kinds of glass sphere pressure housings is written as β pre sph 1 3 15984 p sea and β pre sph 2 3 25055 p sea respectively based on similar elastic mechanics analysis the deformation and displaced volume of the sphere pressure housing are computed the volume expansion coefficient of the sphere pressure housing is written as 13 α tem sph 1 v sph v sph t sea 3 γ sph 1 γ sph δ t sea where γ sph is the linear expansion coefficient of the material of the sphere pressure housing and δ t sea the seawater temperature difference between the surface and the depth h for the glass sphere pressure housings the coefficients of volume expansion are written as α tem sph 1 α tem sph 2 9 9 3 3 t sea 1 0 10 6 based on the bulk modulus data of hydraulic oil from castrol limited 2010 the compressibility of hydraulic oil in the external bladders and the pressure balanced junction box is fitted as β pre ho 0 1039 p sea 169 5 since the compressibility and volume expansion coefficient of solids vary little as the pressure and temperature change they are hypothesized to be approximately constant the thermophysical properties of the materials ashby 2017 carvill 1993 castrol limited 2010 kutz 2015 oberg et al 2016 are shown in table 3 the coefficient of deep contraction and the net buoyancy of the glider not equipped with the compensators are computed and shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively 3 3 optimization of passive buoyancy compensators when the glider is not equipped with the passive buoyancy compensators its net buoyancy varies from 125 5 n to 83 7 n as the depth increases from 0 m to 10 000 m and the variation range is 41 8 n which is shown in fig 4 the reason for this variation is that the coefficient of deep contraction of the glider not equipped with the compensators is smaller than that of seawater as shown in fig 3 to reduce the variation range of the buoyancy the glider is equipped with the passive buoyancy compensators consisting of several bladders filled with the liquid whose coefficient of deep contraction is larger than that of seawater some liquids have larger coefficients of deep contraction than that of seawater such as pentane hexane decane mineral oil paraffin and silicon oil among these pentane and hexane are flammable decane is harmful the phase of the paraffin may change with temperature and mineral oil has a larger density and smaller compressibility than silicon oil phillips et al 2012 therefore silicon oil is selected as the passive buoyancy compensation liquid for the petrel x glider besides silicon oil provides extra net buoyancy for the glider this liquid does not absorb water so its buoyancy maintains constant on the sea surface for a long time which makes it an ideal buoyancy material in comparison the water absorption of syntactic foams makes the net buoyancy decrease in long term underwater applications the density of silicon oil at different pressures was measured by an oscillating u tube system produced by anton parr the relation between its density and the pressure is fitted as 14 ρ c 0 003661 p sea 2 1 184 p sea 781 2 because the compressibility of silicon oil changes little when the temperature varies from 0 c to 30 c it is hypothesized to be a function of the pressure but independent of the temperature the compressibility of silicon oil is given by 15 β pre c 1 ρ c d ρ c d p sea 2 p sea 323 4 p sea 2 323 4 p sea 213400 the volume expansion coefficient of silicon oil changes little as the temperature varies from 0 c to 30 c and the pressure varies from 0 mpa to 103 mpa which is therefore hypothesized to be approximately constant the density of silicon oil at 2 c and 25 c was measured its volume expansion coefficient is given by 16 α tem c ln 758 368 781 053 2 25 1 281 10 3 c 1 the coefficient of deep contraction of compensators is computed and shown in fig 3 the net buoyancy of the glider equipped with compensators is computed and shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 3 the coefficient of deep contraction of the glider not equipped with the compensators is smaller than that of seawater while that of compensators is larger this makes the coefficient of deep contraction of the glider equipped with the compensators closer to that of seawater which keeps the glider near neutrally buoyant the total volume of the passive compensation liquid is optimized to get the minimum variation range of the net buoyancy and the optimal volume is 48 6 l with this volume the net buoyancy of the glider equipped with the compensators varies from 12 2 n to 0 n so the minimum variation range is 12 2 n as shown in fig 4 this contributes to a 70 8 decrease of the variation range of the net buoyancy from 0 m to 10 000 m which makes the glider maintain near neutral buoyancy and the buoyancy driven mechanism can conserve considerable energy to enlarge the endurance of the glider 4 hydrodynamic analysis the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the glider include viscous ones and inertial ones viscous hydrodynamic forces and moments relative to origin o f of the flow frame are described by their relations with the corresponding kinematic variables based on bhatta s expressions bhatta 2006 and the hydrodynamic analysis of the petrel x glider these forces and moments are written in the flow frame as 17 d f 0

boundary layer and the tetrahedral volume mesh describes the other parts the size of the global mesh is set as 512 mm the sizes of the surface mesh of the glider are set as 4 mm 64 mm the cfd analysis is conducted by the anasys fluent its model set up is listed in table 5 a ring shaped computation domain is adopted to calculate the rotary force and moment derivatives as shown in fig 5 its boundary conditions are shown in table 4 the linear velocity is set as 0 5 m s the attack and slide angles are set as 15 15 the turning radiuses are set as 570 m 30m turning right in the horizontal plane or turning down in the vertical plane and 30 m 570 m turning left in the horizontal plane or turning up in the vertical plane the mesh generating method and the model set up of the cfd analysis here are similar to those of the static ones the added momentum sources are integrated into the cfd solver through user defined functions udfs in the rotary cases based on the method proposed by hu and lin 2008 the simulation data are used to fit the hydrodynamic coefficients related to the corresponding velocity variables based on eq 17 the fitted coefficients are listed in table 6 the coordinates of the viscous hydrodynamic forces and moments in the body frame are computed from the ones in the flow frame according to eq 2 the coordinate transformation matrix they are written as 18 x b d f cos β

moments relative to origin o b are expressed in the body frame shown in eq 19 based on fossen s expressions fossen 2011 the inertial hydrodynamic coefficients also called the added mass are computed by the strip theory and panel method the main body and wings are treated as equivalent ellipsoid and panels to compute their added mass then the added mass of the entire glider is determined according to the superposition principle the computational results are listed in table 6 19 g 1 g 2 g 3 g 4 g 5 g 6 λ 11 0 0 0 0 0 0 λ 22 0 0 0 λ 26 0 0 λ 33 λ 34 λ 35 0 0 0 λ 43 λ 44 λ 45 0 0 0 λ 53 λ 54 λ 55

dual buoyancy driven mechanism adjusts the pitch angle and the net buoyancy of the glider at the same time at the beginning of a profile or when encountering the ocean currents the dual propeller propulsive mechanism adjusts the heading of the glider to a target direction the simulator for calculating the motion variables with the given target parameters is established by solving the motion equations of the system with the runge kutta numerical method dormand and prince 1980 shampine and reichelt 1997 the gliding performances in the vertical plane and the steering performances in the horizontal plane are predicted by the simulator and verified by the sea experiments the main variables for controlling the motion of the glider are the target depth the speeds of the two propellers and the driven volumes of oil in fore external bladder for diving aft external bladder for diving fore external bladder for climbing and aft external bladder for climbing the volume range of the oil in each external bladder is 1 l 6 l and the maximum driven volume in each external bladder is 5 l when the glider is on the surface where the density of seawater is 1022 kg m3 the driven volume of oil in each external bladder is set as 3 5 l and when the glider is entirely underwater some ballast weights are allocated at the proper locations to keep the glider neutrally buoyant on the sea surface and level with the horizontal plane when the fore and aft external bladders hold 3 45 l and 5 15 l oil respectively the satellite antenna and the top of the glider emerge out of seawater to communicate with the satellite according to the density computed from the data collected by the onboard ctd the driven volumes of oil in the fore and aft external bladders are adjusted automatically once in each profile when the glider is on the surface this function is designed to keep the antenna high enough to adapt the density variation of seawater on the surface 5 1 gliding performances with the given target depth and driven volume of oil in each external bladder motion variables such as the angle of attack glide angle pitch angle vertical velocity glide velocity duration and voyage of the glider within a single profile are computed by using the simulator the ranges of the average pitch angle and the average glide velocity are computed by using the genetic algorithm goldberg et al 1989 the ranges of the average pitch angles for diving and climbing are 60 0 0 and 0 61 6 respectively the ranges of the average glide velocities for diving and climbing are 0 m s 0 86 m s and 0 m s 1 01 m s respectively within a profile the relation between the average diving pitch angle average diving vertical velocity target depth and driven volume of oil in each external bladder is fitted by the two layer feed forward neural network with 200 sigmoid symmetric hidden neurons and linear output neurons trained by the bayesian regularization backpropagation algorithm foresee and hagan 1997 the diving function v bd 1 v bd 2 t f d d tar θ d tar v ver d tar t is a solver for the desired driven volumes of oil for diving with the target variables similarly the climbing function v bu 1 v bu 2 t f u d tar θ u tar v ver u tar t is a solver for the desired driven volumes of oil for climbing the relative errors of the fittings are less than 0 07 substituting the target inputs into the diving and climbing functions gives the setting values of the driven volume of oil in each external bladder when the target depth is 8000 m diving pitch angle 23 diving vertical velocity 0 25 m s climbing pitch angle 23 and climbing vertical velocity 0 25 m s corresponding driven volumes of oil in fore external bladder for diving aft external bladder for diving fore external bladder for climbing and aft external bladder for climbing are 1 977 l 1 898 l 4 854 l and 5 948 l respectively the time step for the simulation is set as 1 second and the simulation results are shown in fig 7 as mentioned in section 2 the beginning stage and the stage near the maximum depth are relatively short in the whole profile here we mainly focus on the average pitch angle and average vertical velocity of the whole profile thus these complex and short stages are neglected during the simulation to simplify the dynamic model and reduce the computing burden in april 2018 the petrel x glider was launched in the mariana trench see fig 6 the deepest depth that the glider dived to was 8213 m which is the deepest working depth that an underwater glider has ever reached in the sea trial to our knowledge during the sea trial the gliding performances of the glider were tested the time step for recording data during the test was set as 5 seconds to save the memory capacity of the controller for the deepest profile the setting values of the driven volumes of oil were the same as those for the simulation above the test data of the depth pitch angle and vertical velocity are shown in fig 7 together with the simulation results the actual average pitch angles for diving and climbing were 21 4 and 21 0 respectively the actual average vertical velocities for diving and climbing were 0 275 m s and 0 252 m s respectively the test results of the sea trials indicate that the actual gliding performances basically match the simulation which demonstrates the feasibility of the adaptive buoyancy adjustment method the pitch adjustment method through the dual buoyancy driven mechanism the dynamic model and the simulator the pump module is the kernel of the hydraulic drive unit its energy consumption accounts for a large proportion of the total energy consumption of the glider its performances were tested with different outlet pressures and pump speeds the pump volumetric efficiency mechanical efficiency and total efficiency with different outlet pressures and pump speeds are shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the total efficiency of the pump increases with the outlet pressure when the latter is lower than 50 mpa then it stays almost constant between 45 and 50 when the outlet pressure is larger than 50 mpa it can be concluded that the working efficiency of the pump in deep waters is generally higher than that in shallow waters under the torque constraint of the motor for the pump the maximum pump speed is set as 1114 rpm at high pressure the relation between the input power of the pump and outlet pressure is fitted as 21 p pi 147 8 exp p sea 132 1 96 57 2 the relation between the flow rate of the pump and outlet pressure is fitted as 22 q p 50 13 0 002526 p sea 0 9943 the input power and working hours of the pump solenoid valves control boards sensors and antennas are computed then the energy consumption of the glider within a single profile is computed with the driven volumes of oil and the target depth the corresponding available profiles duration and voyage are computed with the capacity limitation of the battery pack when the target depth is 10 000 m and the absolute value of the average vertical velocity is larger than 0 05 m s the longest voyage is computed by using the genetic algorithm goldberg et al 1989 the optimal driven volumes of oil in the fore external bladder for diving aft external bladder for diving fore external bladder for climbing and aft external bladder for climbing are 2 618 l 2 796 l 4 127 l and 3 808 l respectively the longest voyage is 1749 km and the corresponding duration is 82 days 5 2 steering performances due to the difficulty in accurate underwater positioning the glider is set to sail on the sea surface to evaluate its steering performances with accurate gps positioning through using the simulator motion variables such as the linear velocity yaw angular velocity and turning radius of the glider are computed with the given propeller speed with the same speed of the two propellers the glider sails along a straight line the relation between the propulsion velocity and propeller speed is fitted as v t 0 0264 n p when the propeller speed is 2500 rpm the maximum propulsion velocity of the glider is 1 1 m s when the propeller speed is 500 rpm 2500 rpm the relations between the turning radius and angular rate of the glider with propeller speed are fitted as r g 1 69 n p 21 9 and q g 1 80 10 4 n p 2 0 0162 n p 0 142 respectively the minimum turning radius is 36 m and the maximum turning angular rate is 0 51 s the steering performances were simulated when the speed of the right propeller is 1500 rpm and the time step for the simulation is set as 1 second as shown in fig 9 the steering performances were tested during the sea trial in coastal waters of qingdao in march 2018 the speed of the right propeller was the same as the simulation and the time step for recording data during the test was set as 8 seconds to give the antenna enough time for successful gps positioning the actual turning radius was 70 m close to the simulated one of 64 m the average actual turning angular rate was 0 49 s close to the simulated one of 0 43 s the agreement between the simulation and test result proves the feasibility of the dynamic model and the simulator 6 conclusions this paper has described the dynamic modeling and motion analysis for a dual buoyancy driven full ocean depth glider by considering the environmental parameters and corresponding displaced volume change of the entire glider the analysis of the adaptive buoyancy adjustment was conducted and the net buoyancy variation decreased by up to 70 8 through using the passive buoyancy compensators the presented method to make the glider maintain neutral buoyancy can reduce the energy consumption of the dual buoyancy driven mechanism and extend the working depth and endurance the consistency of the simulation and sea trials validates the effectiveness of the adaptive buoyancy adjustment method and the derived dynamic model the proposed methods and model can also be applied to other deep sea underwater vehicles although the maximum test depth of 8213 m in the mariana trench has not yet reached the design depth we believe that the petrel x glider will achieve this design goal with more sea trial opportunities further studies need to be carried out to improve the method of energy consumption management to extend the duration and voyage of the glider several motion patterns can be realized by the petrel x glider such as gliding along a sawtooth path to survey a transection or a grid hovering as a virtual mooring for station keeping and moving toward a region for tracking an oceanographic feature automatically in the future the petrel x glider will be integrated with more oceanographic instruments additionally a fleet of petrel x gliders can survey different regions simultaneously to monitor large areas faster and the collected data can be used to build a spatiotemporal database of the deep ocean with high spatial and temporal resolution acknowledgments the authors are grateful for the support from national key
