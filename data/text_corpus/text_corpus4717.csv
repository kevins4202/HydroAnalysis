23585,a semi active control algorithm using mr dampers is developed for reduction of responses of offshore jacket platforms induced by earthquake ground motions and the responses are obtained for both nonlinear and linearized drag forces the mr dampers are placed at different levels of the jacket structure and the coupled structure damper system is modelled in simulink decentralized sliding mode controllers are designed to drive the response trajectories into the sliding surfaces and the command voltage to the mr dampers are generated with the help of clipped optimal control algorithm the results of the numerical simulations show that the designed semi active sliding mode controller is effective in reducing the structural vibrations caused by earthquake ground motions as a result of linearization of the drag force the effectiveness of the controllers is reduced and responses obtained are conservative in nature i e the increase in controlled responses are more when linearized drag force is considered the control system is found to be stable and robust however the positions and the number of mr dampers have quite significant impact on the performance of the controller keywords decentralized sliding mode control clipped optimal control magnetorheological damper offshore jacket platform earthquake nonlinear linearization 1 introduction the offshore jacket structures dawson 1983 especially the oil and gas production platforms play a very important role in the present day world economy being slender and flexible structures these offshore steel jacket platforms are usually vulnerable to various dynamic excitations such as earthquakes wind waves ice loads ship impact etc to prevent any structural damage the vibration of the offshore platforms under dynamic external loads should be controlled to a desired level studies on vibration control of offshore jacket platforms using passive methods soong and dargush 1997 li et al 2002 soong and spencer 2002 karkoub et al 2011 chandrasekaran et al 2013 sethuraman and venugopal 2013 moharrami and tootkaboni 2014 ha and cheong 2016 active control techniques soong 1990 chen et al 2008 preumont and seto 2008 stewart and lackner 2011 olunloyo and osheku 2012 zhang and li 2015 and semi active control systems gurpinar et al 1980 wang 2002 fisco and adeli 2011 sarrafan et al 2012 wang li 2012 caterino 2015 coudurier et al 2015 have been reported in literature located in hostile ocean environments the offshore jacket platforms are exposed to external disturbances ahmad and ahmad 1992 such as winds and earthquakes along with self excited nonlinear wave forces eventually these external disturbances lead to large oscillations of the system thus affecting the operation and comfort of crew on the offshore platforms and at the same time the external disturbances inevitably affect required control cost adversely among these a strong earthquake ground motion can have a disastrous effect and can cause severe damage to these types of structures approximately 100 offshore platforms have been installed in seismically active regions of the world s oceans therefore it is absolutely necessary to design and develop controllers specifically for the reduction of responses of the jacket platforms caused by earthquake ground excitations gurpinar et al 1980 in context of the above observation however it may be noted that most of the control schemes reported in literature have done more work on wave excitation wang 2002 ma et al 2009 sarrafan et al 2011 2012 zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 ahmadi and nourisola 2016 and the number of studies where seismic excitations were considered is confined among these researches also most have used passive control devices kawano et al 1992 jinping 2006 jin et al 2007 elshafey et al 2009 golafshani and gholizad 2009 monir and nomani 2011 komachi et al 2011 tabeshpour and komachi 2012 mousavi et al 2012 jafarabad et al 2014 lotfollahi yaghin et al 2016 wu et al 2016 passive control devices have an inherent limitation in the sense that their control effectiveness for offshore platforms subjected to an earthquake excitation is less because of the complexity of the excitation their use is also confined due to large installation and maintenance cost studies have also been carried out on the application of active control techniques for seismic vibration mitigation li et al 2005 kim 2009 khaja and kumar 2015 the limitation of the active control systems are the non availability of precious deck space for housing the control system and high requirement of power and maintenance a semi active control system however overcomes these shortcomings a semi active control system has higher reliability better control effect and smaller external energy requirement they are also less vulnerable to power failure which becomes a major drawback in active controllers limited work however has been done on vibration control of offshore jacket platforms subjected to earthquake excitation using semi active controllers yu et al 2010 developed new semi active control strategy to adjust the voltage current of mr dampers to track the optimal desired damping force by the lqr method wang and li 2012 proposed an intelligent control technique based on lqg method for seismic protection of offshore structures studies were done by taghikhany et al 2013 on the effect of h2 lqg algorithm in sirri jacket seismic vibration control under kobe earthquake babaei et al 2016 worked on semi active tmd using lqg algorithm for the suppressing seismic induced vibration of nosrat jacket platform existing in persian gulf it is nonetheless difficult to develop the mathematical model of the structure controller system accurately in case of real structures due to the parameter uncertainties involved in the process this problem is even more critical for semiactive control of offshore jacket platforms using mr dampers as it involves the non linear dynamics of the mr dampers and also the interaction between water and structure these problems however need to be tackled in order to design and develop controllers which will effectively perform in such complex systems the design of the controller becomes even more challenging when the external loads considered are earthquake excitations as against the wave loads because the uncertainties and randomness associated with the former are much more when compared with those associated with the latter it may be noted that a semi active control algorithm which can accommodate uncertainty and imprecision in a more effective way than all the other semi active algorithms mentioned so far due to its inherent robustness and ability to cope with the parameter uncertainties and imprecision is the sliding mode control algorithm from the above discussion it can be inferred that the sliding mode control technique is the most suitable control methodology for the problem considered in the present study however to the best of the authors knowledge there is no result reported in the published literature on sliding mode control for vibration control of offshore platforms subjected to earthquake excitations in order to simplify the analysis procedure in case of offshore structures it is a general practice to linearize the non linear expression of the drag force and replace it with an equivalent linearized term in order to have a proper understanding of the behaviour of the jacket platform it is necessary to study the effect of this linearization on the structure in addition to this a semi active controller is designed and the values of different design parameters are determined based on the response feedback of the structure hence it is evident that the linearization of the drag force has an effect on the performance of a semiactive controller when the actual external excitation or the actual water structure interaction phenomenon is non linear in nature its linearization may result in an erroneous design of the controller which may eventually lead to its poor performance in terms of response reduction no study to investigate the effect of this linearization on the responses of jacket platforms and also on the performance of controllers however is reported in literature unlike the onshore structures in case of offshore structures like jacket platforms which are built in hostile sea environment the optimum number and placement of dampers is a crucial aspect as there is a trade off between controller effectiveness and issues related to cost and difficulties involved in the installation operation and maintenance of the dampers no work is reported in literature in this regard and hence a detailed parametric study on the optimum number and placement of dampers is carried out in the present paper lei et al 2012 states decentralized control strategy is more suitable for structural control of large scale structural systems as it increases in the feasibility of control implementation and decreases the risk on the failure of the control system compared with the conventional centralized control approach it is also reported in literature that the complexities inherent to large scale modern civil structures pose many challenges in the design of feedback structural control systems for dynamic response mitigation key issues in such large scale structural control systems include reduced system reliability increasing communication requirements and longer latencies in the feedback loop to effectively address these issues decentralized control strategies provide promising solutions that allow control systems to operate at high nodal counts wang et al 2009 these problems become even more aggravated in case of a large structure like offshore jacket platform where operation maintenance and repair becomes more difficult due to the hostile sea environment the control systems reported in literature for attenuation of seismic responses of jacket platforms are based on the conventional centralized approach in order to overcome the above mentioned inherent drawbacks of the centralized controllers a decentralized control system is developed in the present study in view of the above discussion it may be summarized that the objectives of the study are to develop a semi active control system for seismic vibration mitigation of offshore jacket platforms which is robust against uncertainties and imprecision and is also based on the decentralized approach to investigate the effect of drag force linearization on the structural behaviour and controller performance and to carry out a parametric study on the optimum number and placement of dampers the semi active control algorithm considered is the sliding mode algorithm using mr dampers installed at different positions and the command voltages supplied to these dampers are regulated through the clipped optimal algorithm a jacket platform available in literature is taken for numerical simulation and it is subjected to real earthquake ground motion 2 formulation 2 1 dynamic model of offshore jacket platform the jacket platform is modelled in simulink considering water structure interaction the equation of motion for an offshore jacket platform subjected to seismic excitations can be written as chakrabarti 1987 1 m x t c x t k x t h u t η x g f 2 where f k d x 1 x g x 1 x g 3 m ms ma ma ρ ci 1 b kd ρ cda where m a m s c k are the added mass the jacket platform mass damping and stiffness matrices respectively ρ c i c d a and b are the sea water density inertia coefficient drag coefficient area and volume matrices the dot operator denotes element wise multiplication between two vectors u t is an r vector consisting of r control forces and ɳ is an n vector denoting the influence of the earthquake excitation h is a n r matrix denoting the location of r controllers in this case the effect of the water structure interaction can be considered as a series of added masses and absolute velocity dependent nonlinear dashpots as shown in fig 3 2 2 modelling of mr damper the design of mr damper is done using bouc wen model dyke et al 1998 zahrai and salehi 2014 the mr damper model consists of a viscous damper tied with original bouc wen model in series and a spring which works in parallel with the whole system force produced by the mr damper in the bouc wen model is described as follows 4 f αz c0 ẋ ẏ k0 x y k1 x x0 c1ẏ k1 x x0 where z is an evolutionary variable that accounts for the history dependence of the response the evolutionary variables z and y are governed by 5 z γ x y z z n 1 β x y z n a x y 6 y 1 c 0 c 1 α z c 0 x k 0 x y where k 1 stiffness of the accumulator c 0 viscous damping at large velocities c 1 viscous damping for force roll off at low velocities k

adjusting the parameters of the model one can control the shape of the hysteresis loops for the yielding element γ β and a are the parameters that control the shape of the hysteresis loops in bouc wen yielding element α and n are other parameters that refer to the internal state z and determine its coupling with the force f and its evolution the relationship between mr dampers input current and input voltage using these coefficients is defined in eqns 7 9 7 α α u αa αbu 8 c1 c1 u c1a c1bu 9 c0 c0 u c0a c0bu where u is given as the output of a first order filter obtained by 10 u η u v where v is the commanded voltage sent to the current driver eqn 10 is necessary to model the dynamics involved in reaching rheological equilibrium and in driving the electromagnet in the mr damper 2 3 sliding mode control algorithm sliding mode control is a control method paul et al 2009 yang et al 2002 yang et al 1994 zhang et al 2012 sarbjeet and datta 2000 which alters the dynamics of a system by application of discontinuous control signal that forces the system to slide along a cross section of the system s normal behaviour the main objective of sliding mode controllers is to design controllers to drive the response trajectory onto the sliding surface or switching surface while at the same time maintaining stable motion on the sliding surface in the design of the sliding surface the external excitation is neglected but is taken into account later in the actual controller design the design of sliding surface consists of two steps at first a sliding surface is designed using an lqr algorithm the purpose of constructing the sliding surface or switching surface is to restrict the system to the switching surface thus producing a desired behaviour of the system the sliding surface s is given by yang et al 1994 11 s pz 0 for simplicity let s s1 s2 sr be an r dimensional sliding surface with r sliding variables r is the number of controllers installed where p r x 2n matrix to be determined such that the motion on the sliding surface is stable for designing this sliding surface the equation of motion for offshore jacket platform 1 is converted into a state space equation 12a z t az t bu t e t where z t a 2n state vector a a 2n x 2n system matrix b a 2n x r matrix and e t a 2n excitation vector respectively given by 12b z t x t x t e t 0 m 1 η x 0 t b 0 m 1 h a 0 i m 1 k m 1 c the design of the sliding surface s pz 0 consists of obtaining the sliding matrix p through the minimization of the performance index j o z t qz dt constrained by the linear form of state space equation in the expression of the cost function q is a positive semi definite weighing matrix for this at first a transformation matrix is obtained 12c d i 2 n r b 1 b 2 1 0 i r d 1 i 2 n r b 1 b 2 1 0 i r b b 1 b 2 where i2n r and ir are 2n r x 2n r and rxr identity matrices respectively and b1 and b2 are 2n r xr and rxr sub matrices obtained from the partition of the b matrix r is the number of controllers installed finally the original sliding surface s pz 0 is obtained as 12d p p d p 1 i r d 12e here p 1 0 5 t 22 1 a 12 p ˆ 2 t 21 p ˆ is obtained by solving the given ricatti matrix 12f a ˆ p ˆ p ˆ a ˆ 0 5 p ˆ a 12 t 22 1 a 12 p ˆ 2 t 11 t 12 t 22 1 t 12 12g a ˆ a 11 a 12 t 22 1 t 21 12h a 11 n r x n r a 12 n r x r are obtained by partitioning of a matrix a a 11 a 12 a 21 a 22 here a dad 1 for the existence of a sliding mode on the switching surface the state velocity vectors should be directed towards the surface i e the system must be stable on the switching surface therefore there must be a lyapunov function v in the neighbourhood of the switching surface the purpose of the controller design is to drive the response trajectory onto the sliding surface s 0 the lyapunov function v 0 5sts is considered the sufficient condition for the sliding mode to be stable is given by v s t s 0 using the state equation of motion we obtain 13a v λ u g i 1 r λ i u i g i i 1 r v i where λ and g r vectors with the ith elements λ i and gi respectively and ui ui t is the ith control force where λ s p b 13b g p b 1 p a z e using the control law proposed by researchers jin et al 2007 u g δ λt in which δ is sliding margin matrix and taking it as manual input we obtain the expression for the control force regulated by both the structural response and the earthquake excitation design and implementation of centralized controllers for large structures like this generally involve taking into consideration the huge cost the complexity of dynamic models and the high number of variables therefore to overcome such problems a decentralized controller has been proposed in this controller the control system is decomposed into a number of interconnected subsystems for each one a local sub controller is designed independently using only local subsystem s state information the obtained decentralized controllers are also reliable in the sense that when some local controllers are out of order the rest of the system can still be in operation 2 4 clipped optimal control algorithm clipped optimal control method is one of the most effective algorithms for semi active control using mr damper the force generated by the mr damper cannot be directly controlled depending on the local response of the structural system only the control voltage v can be directly controlled to increase or decrease the force produced by the device the force generated in the mr damper depends on the local responses of the structural system a clipped optimal algorithm is incorporated so that the mr damper is commanded to generate approximately the desired optimal control force fc this algorithm works on the principle that if the magnitude of desired optimal force is larger than the force f produced by the damper and the two forces have the same sign then to match the force f produced by the damper to the optimal force fc the voltage applied to the current driver is increased to the maximum level otherwise the command voltage is set to zero the given algorithm can be concisely stated as 14 v vmax h fc f f where vmax is the voltage to the current driver associated with saturation of the magnetic field in the mr damper and h is the heaviside step function the schematic diagram fig 1 explains the entire simulation of the sliding mode control algorithm incorporated with mr damper in the offshore jacket platform 3 numerical simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the sliding mode control algorithm in reducing the vibrations induced by earthquake ground motion a steel jacket platform is taken from literature mousavi et al 2012 the platform considered is a four leg platform with the same properties in both directions and all the elements are assumed to remain elastic under the earthquake excitation the density of water is 1000 kg m3 density of steel is 7800 kg m3 the drag and inertia coefficients are 0 7 and 2 respectively and the deck mass of the platform is 1000 ton the platform is modelled as a five degree of freedom system fig 2 a schematic diagram showing the effect of drag forces is shown in fig 3 a more detailed discussion on this is provided in sec 4 6 a schematic diagram of offshore jacket platform explaining the position and number of mr dampers has been given in fig 4 detailed dimension of offshore jacket structure are given in table 1 the stiffness of various floors of the jacket platform obtained from literature mousavi et al 2012 are k1 1 109 n m k2 0 444 109 n m k3 0 375 109 n m k4 0 286 109 n m k5 0 067 109 n m the above mentioned stiffness values are used to find a 5dof stiffness matrix 15 k k 1 k 2 k 2 0 0 0 k 2 k 2 k 3 k 3 0 0 0 k 3 k 3 k 4 k 4 0 0 0 k 4 k 4 k 5 k 5 0 0 0 k 5 k 5 10 9 n m 1

157 154 151 137 1087 1000 kg 294 289 282 202 0 m2 and 258 253 248 177 0 m3 respectively stiffness and mass proportional damping matrices are considered according to the rayleigh a value of 2 is considered as the damping ratio of first two modes mousavi et al 2012 according to these matrices the frequencies of the platform are obtained as shown in table 2 the frequencies are obtained for all the five modes and for two conditions namely in air without water and in water the mass participation factors of first two modes are 81 3 and 14 9 respectively the jacket platform is modelled in simulink matlab taking in consideration the water structure interaction the structure is subjected to the san fernando 1971 earthquake ground excitation and time history analyses are carried out the effectiveness of the sliding mode controller is studied by comparing the uncontrolled and controlled responses of the platform the nonlinear equation of motion of the jacket platform subjected to earthquake excitation eqn 1 is quite often converted into a linear one for simplification this is achieved by linearizing the non linear term in the expression of the drag force the effect of this linearization in terms of the response of the structure and the performance of the controller has been studied the linearization kim 2009 procedure is as mentioned below the non linear drag force is given as eqn 2 f k d x 1 x g x 1 x g the above equation is linearized in the following way 16 x 1 x g 8 π σ r r where σ r r denotes the standard deviation of structural velocity relative to water particles using the linearization the equation of an offshore structure can be rewritten as 17a m x t c 0 x t k x t g x g η x g h u t where 17b c 0 c ka 17c g ka 1 17d ka 8 π σ r r k d as is evident in eqn 17b one component of the drag force arising due to water structure interaction acts like absolute velocity dependent nonlinear dashpots fig 3 thus reducing the structural response the other part gets added to the external seismic excitation apart from the analysis of the structure with the linearized drag force the behaviour of the jacket platform is also investigated without the drag force the criterion used for linearization of the drag force eqn 17d is the mean square error criterion which requires the mean square of error to be the least the mr dampers are installed at the different levels of the offshore jacket platform the parameters of the 20 ton mr damper used is presented in table 3 the operation of each damper is governed by designed sliding mode algorithm and a sliding surface is generated for each damper for full state feedback the lqr method is used for the design of the sliding surface with a diagonal weighting matrix q as follows 18 q diag 10 100 100 100 100000 1 1 1 1 1 the performance index j is minimized by solving the riccati equation 4 results discussions 4 1 effect of number and position of mr dampers to show the performance of the smc a steel jacket platform having five degree of freedom is taken from literature mousavi et al 2012 as shown in fig 2 all elements of this structure are assumed to remain elastic under the action of the earthquake ground motion considered in case of offshore jacket platforms due to fluid structure interaction multiplicative or self excited forces are generated self excited nonlinear hydrodynamic forces are induced due to the flexibility of such structures and their large deformations cause a highly nonlinear response zribi et al 2004 self excited vibrations are disturbances belonging to a fundamentally different class as compared to the free or forced vibrations in a self excited vibration the excitation force that sustains the motion is created or controlled by the motion itself when the motion stops the excitation force disappears since self excited force is associated with the structural velocity and ground motion velocity terms a self excited vibration can be defined as a vibration in which the effective damping of the system is altered and as a result there is a change in the response of the structure a self excited force therefore may or may not increase or decrease the response of a structure significantly depending on structural properties and loading conditions the structure which is modelled using the state space form is subjected to ground motion excitation and hydrodynamic forces including the self excited forces a simulink model of the hydrodynamic force which includes the self excited force is shown in fig 5 in which the dot product of the summation of structural velocity and ground excitation velocity and the absolute value of the summation is taken the output of this simulink subsystem is the hydrodynamic force f which includes the self excited forces as given in eqn 2 two cases considering and ignoring these self excited forces are compared in fig 6 it is observed from the figure that for the structural properties and loading conditions considered in the present study there is very little or negligible effect of the self excited force on the response of the structure in order to investigate the effect of the number of mr dampers and their different arrangements on the performance of the controller the following cases have been considered fig 7 i three mr dampers placed in the bottom three storeys ii three mr dampers positioned in the top three storeys iii three mr dampers placed in the alternate storeys iv two mr dampers installed in the fourth and fifth storeys v a single mr damper installed in the fifth storey vi two mr dampers placed in the top storey in the level of the highest mass vii three mr dampers of lower capacity 1000 kn 800 kn and 600 kn placed in the alternate storeys the fifth floor and first floor displacement controls for these five cases under the san fernando earthquake excitation are compared in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively in case i with varying dampers lowest capacity damper being at the bottom the response reduction at fifth and first floor are 32 3 and 28 4 respectively in cases ii and iii where the mr dampers are installed at the base floors the responses at the first floor are reduced by 43 4 and 79 4 respectively similarly for these two cases the displacement at the fifth floor gets controlled by 16 9 and 35 7 respectively for case iv the response control gets restricted to 14 4 and 20 on fifth and first floor respectively cases v and vi show similar response reduction at the first floors of about 31 7 and 31 5 respectively the status remains similar for the response control at the fifth floor being 29 63 for case v and29 4 for case vi the response reduction for case vi is 43 29 which is the maximum reduction at fifth floor however it reduces to 13 2 in the first floor compared to the bottom level where the jacket platform is fixed to the ocean base the flexibilities of the upper floors are more but the floors masses are comparable consequently the percentage reductions of responses are observed to be more for the higher floors the topmost or the fifth floor however is fixed to the rigid deck and the deck mass is much greater than the mass of the other floors hence due to its greater mass and lesser flexibility the response reduction in the topmost floor is comparatively lesser it is observed that the reduction of responses depends on the placement and the number of mr dampers from fig 8 and fig 9 positioning of the mr dampers in the alternate storeys could have been concluded to be the best option based upon the percentage control of the storey responses positioning the mr dampers near the base of the jacket structure located at the ocean bed also results in greater reduction of responses but unlike an onshore structure from the point of view of installation operation maintenance and cost these positions are not very much practically feasible options for offshore structures which are located in hostile sea environment it is observed that when two dampers are placed in the top storey case vi the percentage reduction increases in that storey but it reduces in the first storey thus there is a local improvement when more number of dampers are placed together in the levels with higher mass but a deterioration is observed in the overall or global sense also when lower capacity dampers are used in the lower storeys case vii not much change in the results is observed in fact there is a decrease in the percentage reduction in this case compared to the case where dampers of same capacity are placed in alternate levels case iii the percentage control for cases iii and iv in the fifth storey differs by about 6 this difference is comparatively very less when cost and difficulties of placement of dampers in the bottom storeys are considered therefore comparing the results obtained for all the different combinations mentioned above and taking into consideration the cost and difficulties of placement of dampers in the bottom storeys near the sea bed the placement of mr dampers in the top two stories of the jacket structure can be considered to be an optimum solution all the results discussed henceforth are obtained by placing the mr dampers in the top two stories of the jacket platform 4 2 performance evaluation of controller the performance of the controller in terms of the effectiveness in reduction of seismic responses is studied for both passive and semi active cases the time histories for the fifth floor displacements for the uncontrolled passive and semi active cases when subjected to the san fernando earthquake are shown in fig 10 the figure shows that the mr dampers are able to reduce the responses in every case but they are able to reduce the response most significantly when they operate in the semi active mode the percentage reductions of responses for the passive and semi active cases are 6 7 and 26 9 for displacement and 4 0 and 23 8 for velocity thus the semi active control algorithm enhances the performance of the controller over the passive case by 20 2 19 8 and 14 4 respectively for three response quantities compared to the bottom level where the jacket platform is fixed to the ocean base the flexibilities of the upper floors are more but the floors masses are comparable consequently the percentage reductions of responses are observed to be more for the higher floors the topmost or the fifth floor however is fixed to the rigid deck and the deck mass is much greater than the mass of the other floors hence due to its greater mass and lesser flexibility the response reduction in the topmost floor is comparatively lesser table 4 shows the uncontrolled and controlled response quantities of the jacket platform under four different earthquake ground motions the maximum values of the displacement responses r m s displacement responses and velocity responses of the fifth floor of the structure are compared the results show that both the passive controllers as well as the semi active controllers are able to reduce the magnitude of all the responses considered for the study however as compared to the passive case the semi active controller shows better performance in terms of reduction of responses the effect of the controller in the reduction of rms displacement of an offshore jacket platform subjected to san fernando earthquake excitation has been shown in fig 11 the absolute maximum displacements and velocities and root mean square rms displacements values of controlled and uncontrolled displacement and their percentage reduction are provided in table 5 from the table one can see that the sliding mode control scheme can effectively reduce the responses of the offshore structure under the different earthquake ground motion considered the reduction in response quantities by the semi active controller is more in case of the displacements ranging from 30 to 75 the rms displacement control values are in the ranges of 15 65 the control of velocity for various floors ranges between 25 and 60 compared to the bottom level where the jacket platform is fixed to the ocean base the flexibilities of the upper floors are more but the floors masses are comparable consequently the percentage reductions of responses are observed to be more for the higher floors the topmost or the fifth floor however is fixed to the rigid deck and the deck mass is much greater than the mass of the other floors hence due to its greater mass and lesser flexibility the response reduction in the topmost floor is again comparatively lesser with respect to the middle floors 4 3 mr dampers the maximum control force to be applied by the mr dampers placed in fifth and the fourth floors for complete control of the responses are 1 43 104 kn and 3 9 104kn respectively however the responses are reduced to certain extent with the help of the mr dampers a comparison has been shown explaining the effect of voltage of mr damper showing time histories mr damper control force and the corresponding displacement respectively figs 12 and 13 the time history of the command voltage applied to the mr damper at the fifth floor regulated by the clipped optimal algorithm is depicted in fig 14 a maximum of 10 v is applied to the 20 ton mr damper with a maximum force capacity of 1000 kn generally the mass of the mr dampers are not included in the mass matrix in the studies on vibration control of structures and in the present study also these masses are not taken the number of mr dampers used in the present study for different cases are one two and three which consist of a negligible proportion of the total structural mass if the added mass is taken into consideration it is even lesser the effect of the mr damper mass on the structural behaviour even though negligible may still be a little more when they are placed away from the deck where the structural mass is mainly concentrated but in summary it can be stated that even though the mr damper masses do add up to the actual mass of the structure they may be neglected irrespective of their placement positions for all practical purposes without any sort of compromise on the results obtained and hence on the conclusions derived the figure shows that the algorithm operates in an on off mode with the voltage switching between 0 v and 10 v the time history of the control force generated by the fifth storey damper is shown in fig 15 the maximum movement of the damper is 12 63 cm figs 16 and 17 show the response plots of fifth and fourth storey mr dampers it can be observed that the imposed cycles trace a suitable path and dissipate noticeable amount of energy induced by the earthquake ground motion and significantly reduce the share of structural elements in energy absorption the mr dampers have been modelled based on the bouc wen relationship and therefore it is seen that the force velocity curves follow the pattern predicted by the bouc wen model exhibiting a typical non linear hysteretic rheological behaviour the areas enclosed by the force displacement plots indicate that the mr dampers are able to effectively dissipate the energy induced to the structure by the earthquake excitations since the displacement excursions are more in the fifth storey damper maximum being in the range of 20 cm compared to that in fourth storey maximum being in the range of 7 cm the control force produced by the mr damper is also more in fifth storey a maximum force of 745 8 kn occurs at 8 37s in the mr damper located at fifth storey whereas minimum force of 836 16 kn occurs at 8 19 s in this damper for the fourth storey maximum force of 369 15 kn occurs at 8 03 s and a minimum force of 404 60 kn takes place at 8 22 s 4 4 stability the variations of the sliding surfaces s t for the fifth and fourth floor controllers are illustrated in fig 18 a and fig 18 b it can be seen that the sliding functions s t are not equal to 0 but the average values of the sliding functions s t tend to zero theoretically even though the sliding function should be zero i e s t 0 however due to the external disturbances seismic excitation there always exist deviations in the sliding function from the sliding surface and the sliding mode controller effectively reduces these deviations by driving the trajectory towards the sliding surface in fig 19 a and fig 19 b the phase planes for the top two stories of the jacket structure controlled by the smc are shown if we look at the resultant motion on the sliding surface or the phase plane trajectory plots it is observed that each of the trajectories slides towards its respective sliding surface at s 0 or the equilibrium point and hence it can be concluded that the closed loop system is stable during the reaching phase however period the system response is sensitive to seismic excitations 4 5 effect of sliding margin in the design of the sliding mode controller an assumed value of the sliding margin is taken however in order to investigate the sensitivity of this constant a parametric study is carried out by varying its value the result of this parametric variation is depicted in fig 20 the figure indicates that the performance of controller in terms of the response reduction of the structure does not vary with any change in the value of the sliding margin over a significantly large range thus it may be concluded that the controller is practically insensitive to this parameter which depends on the choice of the individual designer and therefore can be considered to be robust 4 6 effect of linearization of drag force in order to simplify the analysis procedure it is a general practice to linearize a non linear system and replace it with an equivalent linearized one in the time domain analysis procedures the nonlinear dynamic systems are usually solved using iterative methods and the solutions may take longer time to complete due to convergence problems linearization is done especially when frequency domain analyses and stochastic analyses of structures are carried out in order to have a proper understanding of the behaviour of the jacket platform it is necessary to study the effect of this linearization on the structure in addition to this a semi active controller is designed and the values of different design parameters are determined based on the response feedback of the structure hence it is evident that the linearization of the drag force has an effect on the performance of a semiactive controller when the actual external excitation or the actual water structure interaction phenomenon is non linear in nature its linearization may result in an erroneous design of the controller which may eventually lead to its poor performance in terms of response reduction a comparative study has been done showing the difference in the structural responses and controller performance when the structure is subjected to non linear and linearized drag forces the effect of the drag force is shown with the help of a virtual diagram fig 3 where the drag force is idealized as dampers installed at various storey levels of the offshore jacket platform the role of the drag force in an offshore jacket structure is same as that of a damper in any structure so the removal of drag force would have same effect as that of the removal of damper from the structure it is evident from fig 21 that there is an increase in response when the structure is analysed without the drag force and also when the drag force is linearized as compared to that with nonlinear drag force the removal of drag force has the same impact on the structure as that of removal of dampers from the structure thus increasing the response of the structure the figures show that out of the two cases the increase in response is more for the linearized case a comparison of tables 4 and 6 can well explain the effect of linearization of drag forces on the responses of an offshore jacket platform when subjected to various earthquakes the responses of the jacket structure after the linearization of the drag force are found to much higher for the earthquake ground accelerations as compared to that of non linear drag force the response quantities shown in tables 5 and 7 are compared and it can be concluded that both the controlled and uncontrolled absolute maximum values of all these response quantities namely displacement velocity and rms displacement at each storey level increase when the structure is analysed using linearized drag force however in most of the cases this increase due to linearization is more for the controlled responses of the jacket platform the average increases for the above mentioned response quantities are around 600 300 25 and 650 respectively for the uncontrolled responses and 800 400 30 and 900 respectively for controlled responses therefore the linearization technique gives conservative results i e the increase in controlled responses is more when linearized drag force is considered the overestimation shown is maximum for displacement and velocity as a result of this when the performance of the controller for the two cases tables 5 and 7 considering nonlinear drag and considering linearized drag are compared the results indicate decrease in effectiveness of controllers in terms of percentage control in the linearized case for almost all the responses the performance of the controller shows maximum deterioration for displacement and velocity even almost 100 decreases in some cases this is because of the increase in controlled displacement and velocity values as mentioned before due to drag force linearization is more than the corresponding increase in case of the uncontrolled values when the control forces developed are compared the time history plot as given in fig 22 shows that maximum values of the control forces in the two cases one with non linear drag and the other without any drag force are comparable there is however an increase of about 100 in the control force developed when the drag force is linearized the system with non linear drag force showed better response control as compared to system with linearized drag force the above mentioned decrease in controller effectiveness may be attributed to the fact that both uncontrolled and controlled responses increase due to linearization of drag forces but the increase in the controlled responses is more than the increase in the uncontrolled responses 5 conclusions a decentralized sliding mode control algorithm using mr dampers is developed to mitigate the seismically induced vibrations in an offshore jacket platform numerical results indicate that the number of mr dampers and their placements have significant effect on the performance of the controller in terms of the percentage reduction of responses the sliding mode controller effectively reduces the deviations in the sliding function values by driving the trajectory towards the sliding surface and it can be inferred that system is stable the hysteric cycles indicate that the energy induced by the earthquake ground motion is effectively dissipated and hence the share of structural elements in energy absorption is reduced the performance of controller does not show any sensitivity to any variation in the sliding margin which depends on the choice of the individual designer and the controller can therefore be considered to be robust the effect of linearization of the drag force is investigated by comparing the performance of the controller for two cases with nonlinear drag and with linearized drag force the results indicate that evaluation of the controller effectiveness is conservative when drag forces are linearized since a decrease in percentage reduction is observed for almost all the responses this is predominant for displacement and velocity the above mentioned decrease in controller effectiveness may be attributed to the fact that both uncontrolled and controlled responses increase due to linearization of drag forces but the increase in the controlled responses is more than the increase in the uncontrolled responses in view of the above it may further be noted that the linearization technique gives conservative estimates of the structural responses 
23585,a semi active control algorithm using mr dampers is developed for reduction of responses of offshore jacket platforms induced by earthquake ground motions and the responses are obtained for both nonlinear and linearized drag forces the mr dampers are placed at different levels of the jacket structure and the coupled structure damper system is modelled in simulink decentralized sliding mode controllers are designed to drive the response trajectories into the sliding surfaces and the command voltage to the mr dampers are generated with the help of clipped optimal control algorithm the results of the numerical simulations show that the designed semi active sliding mode controller is effective in reducing the structural vibrations caused by earthquake ground motions as a result of linearization of the drag force the effectiveness of the controllers is reduced and responses obtained are conservative in nature i e the increase in controlled responses are more when linearized drag force is considered the control system is found to be stable and robust however the positions and the number of mr dampers have quite significant impact on the performance of the controller keywords decentralized sliding mode control clipped optimal control magnetorheological damper offshore jacket platform earthquake nonlinear linearization 1 introduction the offshore jacket structures dawson 1983 especially the oil and gas production platforms play a very important role in the present day world economy being slender and flexible structures these offshore steel jacket platforms are usually vulnerable to various dynamic excitations such as earthquakes wind waves ice loads ship impact etc to prevent any structural damage the vibration of the offshore platforms under dynamic external loads should be controlled to a desired level studies on vibration control of offshore jacket platforms using passive methods soong and dargush 1997 li et al 2002 soong and spencer 2002 karkoub et al 2011 chandrasekaran et al 2013 sethuraman and venugopal 2013 moharrami and tootkaboni 2014 ha and cheong 2016 active control techniques soong 1990 chen et al 2008 preumont and seto 2008 stewart and lackner 2011 olunloyo and osheku 2012 zhang and li 2015 and semi active control systems gurpinar et al 1980 wang 2002 fisco and adeli 2011 sarrafan et al 2012 wang li 2012 caterino 2015 coudurier et al 2015 have been reported in literature located in hostile ocean environments the offshore jacket platforms are exposed to external disturbances ahmad and ahmad 1992 such as winds and earthquakes along with self excited nonlinear wave forces eventually these external disturbances lead to large oscillations of the system thus affecting the operation and comfort of crew on the offshore platforms and at the same time the external disturbances inevitably affect required control cost adversely among these a strong earthquake ground motion can have a disastrous effect and can cause severe damage to these types of structures approximately 100 offshore platforms have been installed in seismically active regions of the world s oceans therefore it is absolutely necessary to design and develop controllers specifically for the reduction of responses of the jacket platforms caused by earthquake ground excitations gurpinar et al 1980 in context of the above observation however it may be noted that most of the control schemes reported in literature have done more work on wave excitation wang 2002 ma et al 2009 sarrafan et al 2011 2012 zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 ahmadi and nourisola 2016 and the number of studies where seismic excitations were considered is confined among these researches also most have used passive control devices kawano et al 1992 jinping 2006 jin et al 2007 elshafey et al 2009 golafshani and gholizad 2009 monir and nomani 2011 komachi et al 2011 tabeshpour and komachi 2012 mousavi et al 2012 jafarabad et al 2014 lotfollahi yaghin et al 2016 wu et al 2016 passive control devices have an inherent limitation in the sense that their control effectiveness for offshore platforms subjected to an earthquake excitation is less because of the complexity of the excitation their use is also confined due to large installation and maintenance cost studies have also been carried out on the application of active control techniques for seismic vibration mitigation li et al 2005 kim 2009 khaja and kumar 2015 the limitation of the active control systems are the non availability of precious deck space for housing the control system and high requirement of power and maintenance a semi active control system however overcomes these shortcomings a semi active control system has higher reliability better control effect and smaller external energy requirement they are also less vulnerable to power failure which becomes a major drawback in active controllers limited work however has been done on vibration control of offshore jacket platforms subjected to earthquake excitation using semi active controllers yu et al 2010 developed new semi active control strategy to adjust the voltage current of mr dampers to track the optimal desired damping force by the lqr method wang and li 2012 proposed an intelligent control technique based on lqg method for seismic protection of offshore structures studies were done by taghikhany et al 2013 on the effect of h2 lqg algorithm in sirri jacket seismic vibration control under kobe earthquake babaei et al 2016 worked on semi active tmd using lqg algorithm for the suppressing seismic induced vibration of nosrat jacket platform existing in persian gulf it is nonetheless difficult to develop the mathematical model of the structure controller system accurately in case of real structures due to the parameter uncertainties involved in the process this problem is even more critical for semiactive control of offshore jacket platforms using mr dampers as it involves the non linear dynamics of the mr dampers and also the interaction between water and structure these problems however need to be tackled in order to design and develop controllers which will effectively perform in such complex systems the design of the controller becomes even more challenging when the external loads considered are earthquake excitations as against the wave loads because the uncertainties and randomness associated with the former are much more when compared with those associated with the latter it may be noted that a semi active control algorithm which can accommodate uncertainty and imprecision in a more effective way than all the other semi active algorithms mentioned so far due to its inherent robustness and ability to cope with the parameter uncertainties and imprecision is the sliding mode control algorithm from the above discussion it can be inferred that the sliding mode control technique is the most suitable control methodology for the problem considered in the present study however to the best of the authors knowledge there is no result reported in the published literature on sliding mode control for vibration control of offshore platforms subjected to earthquake excitations in order to simplify the analysis procedure in case of offshore structures it is a general practice to linearize the non linear expression of the drag force and replace it with an equivalent linearized term in order to have a proper understanding of the behaviour of the jacket platform it is necessary to study the effect of this linearization on the structure in addition to this a semi active controller is designed and the values of different design parameters are determined based on the response feedback of the structure hence it is evident that the linearization of the drag force has an effect on the performance of a semiactive controller when the actual external excitation or the actual water structure interaction phenomenon is non linear in nature its linearization may result in an erroneous design of the controller which may eventually lead to its poor performance in terms of response reduction no study to investigate the effect of this linearization on the responses of jacket platforms and also on the performance of controllers however is reported in literature unlike the onshore structures in case of offshore structures like jacket platforms which are built in hostile sea environment the optimum number and placement of dampers is a crucial aspect as there is a trade off between controller effectiveness and issues related to cost and difficulties involved in the installation operation and maintenance of the dampers no work is reported in literature in this regard and hence a detailed parametric study on the optimum number and placement of dampers is carried out in the present paper lei et al 2012 states decentralized control strategy is more suitable for structural control of large scale structural systems as it increases in the feasibility of control implementation and decreases the risk on the failure of the control system compared with the conventional centralized control approach it is also reported in literature that the complexities inherent to large scale modern civil structures pose many challenges in the design of feedback structural control systems for dynamic response mitigation key issues in such large scale structural control systems include reduced system reliability increasing communication requirements and longer latencies in the feedback loop to effectively address these issues decentralized control strategies provide promising solutions that allow control systems to operate at high nodal counts wang et al 2009 these problems become even more aggravated in case of a large structure like offshore jacket platform where operation maintenance and repair becomes more difficult due to the hostile sea environment the control systems reported in literature for attenuation of seismic responses of jacket platforms are based on the conventional centralized approach in order to overcome the above mentioned inherent drawbacks of the centralized controllers a decentralized control system is developed in the present study in view of the above discussion it may be summarized that the objectives of the study are to develop a semi active control system for seismic vibration mitigation of offshore jacket platforms which is robust against uncertainties and imprecision and is also based on the decentralized approach to investigate the effect of drag force linearization on the structural behaviour and controller performance and to carry out a parametric study on the optimum number and placement of dampers the semi active control algorithm considered is the sliding mode algorithm using mr dampers installed at different positions and the command voltages supplied to these dampers are regulated through the clipped optimal algorithm a jacket platform available in literature is taken for numerical simulation and it is subjected to real earthquake ground motion 2 formulation 2 1 dynamic model of offshore jacket platform the jacket platform is modelled in simulink considering water structure interaction the equation of motion for an offshore jacket platform subjected to seismic excitations can be written as chakrabarti 1987 1 m x t c x t k x t h u t η x g f 2 where f k d x 1 x g x 1 x g 3 m ms ma ma ρ ci

area and volume matrices the dot operator denotes element wise multiplication between two vectors u t is an r vector consisting of r control forces and ɳ is an n vector denoting the influence of the earthquake excitation h is a n r matrix denoting the location of r controllers in this case the effect of the water structure interaction can be considered as a series of added masses and absolute velocity dependent nonlinear dashpots as shown in fig 3 2 2 modelling of mr damper the design of mr damper is done using bouc wen model dyke et al 1998 zahrai and salehi 2014 the mr damper model consists of a viscous damper tied with original bouc wen model in series and a spring which works in parallel with the whole system force produced by the mr damper in the bouc wen model is described as follows 4 f αz c0 ẋ ẏ k0 x y k1 x x0 c1ẏ k1 x x0 where z is an evolutionary variable that accounts for the history dependence of the response the evolutionary variables z and y are governed by 5 z

yielding element α and n are other parameters that refer to the internal state z and determine its coupling with the force f and its evolution the relationship between mr dampers input current and input voltage using these coefficients is defined in eqns 7 9 7 α α u αa αbu 8 c1 c1 u c1a c1bu 9 c0 c0 u c0a c0bu where u is given as the output of a first order filter obtained by 10 u η u v where v is the commanded voltage sent to the current driver eqn 10 is necessary to model the dynamics involved in reaching rheological equilibrium and in driving the electromagnet in the mr damper 2 3 sliding mode control algorithm sliding mode control is a control method paul et al 2009 yang et al 2002 yang et al 1994 zhang et al 2012 sarbjeet and datta 2000 which alters the dynamics of a system by application of discontinuous control signal that forces the system to slide along a cross section of the system s normal behaviour the main objective of sliding mode controllers is to design controllers to drive the response trajectory onto the sliding surface or switching surface while at the same time maintaining stable motion on the sliding surface in the design of the sliding surface the external excitation is neglected but is taken into account later in the actual controller design the design of sliding surface consists of two steps at first a sliding surface is designed using an lqr algorithm the purpose of constructing the sliding surface or switching surface is to restrict the system to the switching surface thus producing a desired behaviour of the system the sliding surface s is given by yang et al 1994 11 s pz 0 for simplicity let s s1 s2 sr be an r dimensional sliding surface with r sliding variables r is the number of controllers installed where p r x 2n matrix to be determined such that the motion on the sliding surface is stable for designing this sliding surface the equation of motion for offshore jacket platform 1 is converted into a state space equation 12a z t az t bu t e t where z t a 2n state vector a a 2n x 2n system matrix b a 2n x r matrix and e t a 2n excitation vector respectively given by 12b z t x t x t e t 0 m 1 η x 0 t b 0 m 1 h

state space equation in the expression of the cost function q is a positive semi definite weighing matrix for this at first a transformation matrix is obtained 12c d i 2 n r b 1 b 2 1 0 i r d 1 i 2 n

the number of controllers installed finally the original sliding surface s pz 0 is obtained as 12d p p d p 1 i r d 12e here p 1 0 5 t 22 1 a 12 p ˆ 2 t 21 p ˆ is obtained by solving the given ricatti

a 22 here a dad 1 for the existence of a sliding mode on the switching surface the state velocity vectors should be directed towards the surface i e the system must be stable on the switching surface therefore there must be a lyapunov function v in the neighbourhood of the switching surface the purpose of the controller design is to drive the response trajectory onto the sliding surface s 0 the lyapunov function v 0 5sts is considered the sufficient condition for the sliding mode to be stable is given by v s t s 0 using the state equation of motion we obtain 13a v λ u g i 1 r λ i u i g i i 1 r v i where λ and g r vectors with the ith elements λ i and gi respectively and ui ui t is the ith control force where λ s p b 13b g p b 1 p a z e using the control law proposed by researchers jin et al 2007 u g δ λt in which δ is sliding margin matrix and taking it as manual input we obtain the expression for the control force regulated by both the structural response and the earthquake excitation design and implementation of centralized controllers for large structures like this generally involve taking into consideration the huge cost the complexity of dynamic models and the high number of variables therefore to overcome such problems a decentralized controller has been proposed in this controller the control system is decomposed into a number of interconnected subsystems for each one a local sub controller is designed independently using only local subsystem s state information the obtained decentralized controllers are also reliable in the sense that when some local controllers are out of order the rest of the system can still be in operation 2 4 clipped optimal control algorithm clipped optimal control method is one of the most effective algorithms for semi active control using mr damper the force generated by the mr damper cannot be directly controlled depending on the local response of the structural system only the control voltage v can be directly controlled to increase or decrease the force produced by the device the force generated in the mr damper depends on the local responses of the structural system a clipped optimal algorithm is incorporated so that the mr damper is commanded to generate approximately the desired optimal control force fc this algorithm works on the principle that if the magnitude of desired optimal force is larger than the force f produced by the damper and the two forces have the same sign then to match the force f produced by the damper to the optimal force fc the voltage applied to the current driver is increased to the maximum level otherwise the command voltage is set to zero the given algorithm can be concisely stated as 14 v vmax h fc f f where vmax is the voltage to the current driver associated with saturation of the magnetic field in the mr damper and h is the heaviside step function the schematic diagram fig 1 explains the entire simulation of the sliding mode control algorithm incorporated with mr damper in the offshore jacket platform 3 numerical simulation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the sliding mode control algorithm in reducing the vibrations induced by earthquake ground motion a steel jacket platform is taken from literature mousavi et al 2012 the platform considered is a four leg platform with the same properties in both directions and all the elements are assumed to remain elastic under the earthquake excitation the density of water is 1000 kg m3 density of steel is 7800 kg m3 the drag and inertia coefficients are 0 7 and 2 respectively and the deck mass of the platform is 1000 ton the platform is modelled as a five degree of freedom system fig 2 a schematic diagram showing the effect of drag forces is shown in fig 3 a more detailed discussion on this is provided in sec 4 6 a schematic diagram of offshore jacket platform explaining the position and number of mr dampers has been given in fig 4 detailed dimension of offshore jacket structure are given in table 1 the stiffness of various floors of the jacket platform obtained from literature mousavi et al 2012 are k1 1 109 n m k2 0 444 109 n m k3 0 375 109 n m k4 0 286 109 n m k5

157 154 151 137 1087 1000 kg 294 289 282 202 0 m2 and 258 253 248 177 0 m3 respectively stiffness and mass proportional damping matrices are considered according to the rayleigh a value of 2 is considered as the damping ratio of first two modes mousavi et al 2012 according to these matrices the frequencies of the platform are obtained as shown in table 2 the frequencies are obtained for all the five modes and for two conditions namely in air without water and in water the mass participation factors of first two modes are 81 3 and 14 9 respectively the jacket platform is modelled in simulink matlab taking in consideration the water structure interaction the structure is subjected to the san fernando 1971 earthquake ground excitation and time history analyses are carried out the effectiveness of the sliding mode controller is studied by comparing the uncontrolled and controlled responses of the platform the nonlinear equation of motion of the jacket platform subjected to earthquake excitation eqn 1 is quite often converted into a linear one for simplification this is achieved by linearizing the non linear term in the expression of the drag force the effect of this linearization in terms of the response of the structure and the performance of the controller has been studied the linearization kim 2009 procedure is as mentioned below the non linear drag force is given as eqn 2 f k d x 1 x g x 1 x g the above equation is linearized in the following way 16 x 1 x g 8 π σ r r where σ r r denotes the standard deviation of structural velocity relative to water particles using the linearization the equation of an offshore structure can be rewritten as 17a m x t c 0 x t k x t g x g η x g h u t where 17b c 0 c ka 17c g ka 1 17d ka 8 π σ r r k d as is evident in eqn 17b one component of the drag force arising due to water structure interaction acts like absolute velocity dependent nonlinear dashpots fig 3 thus reducing the structural response the other part gets added to the external seismic excitation apart from the analysis of the structure with the linearized drag force the behaviour of the jacket platform is also investigated without the drag force the criterion used for linearization of the drag force eqn 17d is the mean square error criterion which requires the mean square of error to be the least the mr dampers are installed at the different levels of the offshore jacket platform the parameters of the 20 ton mr damper used is presented in table 3 the operation of each damper is governed by designed sliding mode algorithm and a sliding surface is generated for each damper for full state feedback the lqr method is used for the design of the sliding surface with a diagonal weighting matrix q as follows 18 q diag 10 100 100 100 100000 1 1 1 1 1 the performance index j is minimized by solving the riccati equation 4 results discussions 4 1 effect of number and position of mr dampers to show the performance of the smc a steel jacket platform having five degree of freedom is taken from literature mousavi et al 2012 as shown in fig 2 all elements of this structure are assumed to remain elastic under the action of the earthquake ground motion considered in case of offshore jacket platforms due to fluid structure interaction multiplicative or self excited forces are generated self excited nonlinear hydrodynamic forces are induced due to the flexibility of such structures and their large deformations cause a highly nonlinear response zribi et al 2004 self excited vibrations are disturbances belonging to a fundamentally different class as compared to the free or forced vibrations in a self excited vibration the excitation force that sustains the motion is created or controlled by the motion itself when the motion stops the excitation force disappears since self excited force is associated with the structural velocity and ground motion velocity terms a self excited vibration can be defined as a vibration in which the effective damping of the system is altered and as a result there is a change in the response of the structure a self excited force therefore may or may not increase or decrease the response of a structure significantly depending on structural properties and loading conditions the structure which is modelled using the state space form is subjected to ground motion excitation and hydrodynamic forces including the self excited forces a simulink model of the hydrodynamic force which includes the self excited force is shown in fig 5 in which the dot product of the summation of structural velocity and ground excitation velocity and the absolute value of the summation is taken the output of this simulink subsystem is the hydrodynamic force f which includes the self excited forces as given in eqn 2 two cases considering and ignoring these self excited forces are compared in fig 6 it is observed from the figure that for the structural properties and loading conditions considered in the present study there is very little or negligible effect of the self excited force on the response of the structure in order to investigate the effect of the number of mr dampers and their different arrangements on the performance of the controller the following cases have been considered fig 7 i three mr dampers placed in the bottom three storeys ii three mr dampers positioned in the top three storeys iii three mr dampers placed in the alternate storeys iv two mr dampers installed in the fourth and fifth storeys v a single mr damper installed in the fifth storey vi two mr dampers placed in the top storey in the level of the highest mass vii three mr dampers of lower capacity 1000 kn 800 kn and 600 kn placed in the alternate storeys the fifth floor and first floor displacement controls for these five cases under the san fernando earthquake excitation are compared in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively in case i with varying dampers lowest capacity damper being at the bottom the response reduction at fifth and first floor are 32 3 and 28 4 respectively in cases ii and iii where the mr dampers are installed at the base floors the responses at the first floor are reduced by 43 4 and 79 4 respectively similarly for these two cases the displacement at the fifth floor gets controlled by 16 9 and 35 7 respectively for case iv the response control gets restricted to 14 4 and 20 on fifth and first floor respectively cases v and vi show similar response reduction at the first floors of about 31 7 and 31 5 respectively the status remains similar for the response control at the fifth floor being 29 63 for case v and29 4 for case vi the response reduction for case vi is 43 29 which is the maximum reduction at fifth floor however it reduces to 13 2 in the first floor compared to the bottom level where the jacket platform is fixed to the ocean base the flexibilities of the upper floors are more but the floors masses are comparable consequently the percentage reductions of responses are observed to be more for the higher floors the topmost or the fifth floor however is fixed to the rigid deck and the deck mass is much greater than the mass of the other floors hence due to its greater mass and lesser flexibility the response reduction in the topmost floor is comparatively lesser it is observed that the reduction of responses depends on the placement and the number of mr dampers from fig 8 and fig 9 positioning of the mr dampers in the alternate storeys could have been concluded to be the best option based upon the percentage control of the storey responses positioning the mr dampers near the base of the jacket structure located at the ocean bed also results in greater reduction of responses but unlike an onshore structure from the point of view of installation operation maintenance and cost these positions are not very much practically feasible options for offshore structures which are located in hostile sea environment it is observed that when two dampers are placed in the top storey case vi the percentage reduction increases in that storey but it reduces in the first storey thus there is a local improvement when more number of dampers are placed together in the levels with higher mass but a deterioration is observed in the overall or global sense also when lower capacity dampers are used in the lower storeys case vii not much change in the results is observed in fact there is a decrease in the percentage reduction in this case compared to the case where dampers of same capacity are placed in alternate levels case iii the percentage control for cases iii and iv in the fifth storey differs by about 6 this difference is comparatively very less when cost and difficulties of placement of dampers in the bottom storeys are considered therefore comparing the results obtained for all the different combinations mentioned above and taking into consideration the cost and difficulties of placement of dampers in the bottom storeys near the sea bed the placement of mr dampers in the top two stories of the jacket structure can be considered to be an optimum solution all the results discussed henceforth are obtained by placing the mr dampers in the top two stories of the jacket platform 4 2 performance evaluation of controller the performance of the controller in terms of the effectiveness in reduction of seismic responses is studied for both passive and semi active cases the time histories for the fifth floor displacements for the uncontrolled passive and semi active cases when subjected to the san fernando earthquake are shown in fig 10 the figure shows that the mr dampers are able to reduce the responses in every case but they are able to reduce the response most significantly when they operate in the semi active mode the percentage reductions of responses for the passive and semi active cases are 6 7 and 26 9 for displacement and 4 0 and 23 8 for velocity thus the semi active control algorithm enhances the performance of the controller over the passive case by 20 2 19 8 and 14 4 respectively for three response quantities compared to the bottom level where the jacket platform is fixed to the ocean base the flexibilities of the upper floors are more but the floors masses are comparable consequently the percentage reductions of responses are observed to be more for the higher floors the topmost or the fifth floor however is fixed to the rigid deck and the deck mass is much greater than the mass of the other floors hence due to its greater mass and lesser flexibility the response reduction in the topmost floor is comparatively lesser table 4 shows the uncontrolled and controlled response quantities of the jacket platform under four different earthquake ground motions the maximum values of the displacement responses r m s displacement responses and velocity responses of the fifth floor of the structure are compared the results show that both the passive controllers as well as the semi active controllers are able to reduce the magnitude of all the responses considered for the study however as compared to the passive case the semi active controller shows better performance in terms of reduction of responses the effect of the controller in the reduction of rms displacement of an offshore jacket platform subjected to san fernando earthquake excitation has been shown in fig 11 the absolute maximum displacements and velocities and root mean square rms displacements values of controlled and uncontrolled displacement and their percentage reduction are provided in table 5 from the table one can see that the sliding mode control scheme can effectively reduce the responses of the offshore structure under the different earthquake ground motion considered the reduction in response quantities by the semi active controller is more in case of the displacements ranging from 30 to 75 the rms displacement control values are in the ranges of 15 65 the control of velocity for various floors ranges between 25 and 60 compared to the bottom level where the jacket platform is fixed to the ocean base the flexibilities of the upper floors are more but the floors masses are comparable consequently the percentage reductions of responses are observed to be more for the higher floors the topmost or the fifth floor however is fixed to the rigid deck and the deck mass is much greater than the mass of the other floors hence due to its greater mass and lesser flexibility the response reduction in the topmost floor is again comparatively lesser with respect to the middle floors 4 3 mr dampers the maximum control force to be applied by the mr dampers placed in fifth and the fourth floors for complete control of the responses are 1 43 104 kn and 3 9 104kn respectively however the responses are reduced to certain extent with the help of the mr dampers a comparison has been shown explaining the effect of voltage of mr damper showing time histories mr damper control force and the corresponding displacement respectively figs 12 and 13 the time history of the command voltage applied to the mr damper at the fifth floor regulated by the clipped optimal algorithm is depicted in fig 14 a maximum of 10 v is applied to the 20 ton mr damper with a maximum force capacity of 1000 kn generally the mass of the mr dampers are not included in the mass matrix in the studies on vibration control of structures and in the present study also these masses are not taken the number of mr dampers used in the present study for different cases are one two and three which consist of a negligible proportion of the total structural mass if the added mass is taken into consideration it is even lesser the effect of the mr damper mass on the structural behaviour even though negligible may still be a little more when they are placed away from the deck where the structural mass is mainly concentrated but in summary it can be stated that even though the mr damper masses do add up to the actual mass of the structure they may be neglected irrespective of their placement positions for all practical purposes without any sort of compromise on the results obtained and hence on the conclusions derived the figure shows that the algorithm operates in an on off mode with the voltage switching between 0 v and 10 v the time history of the control force generated by the fifth storey damper is shown in fig 15 the maximum movement of the damper is 12 63 cm figs 16 and 17 show the response plots of fifth and fourth storey mr dampers it can be observed that the imposed cycles trace a suitable path and dissipate noticeable amount of energy induced by the earthquake ground motion and significantly reduce the share of structural elements in energy absorption the mr dampers have been modelled based on the bouc wen relationship and therefore it is seen that the force velocity curves follow the pattern predicted by the bouc wen model exhibiting a typical non linear hysteretic rheological behaviour the areas enclosed by the force displacement plots indicate that the mr dampers are able to effectively dissipate the energy induced to the structure by the earthquake excitations since the displacement excursions are more in the fifth storey damper maximum being in the range of 20 cm compared to that in fourth storey maximum being in the range of 7 cm the control force produced by the mr damper is also more in fifth storey a maximum force of 745 8 kn occurs at 8 37s in the mr damper located at fifth storey whereas minimum force of 836 16 kn occurs at 8 19 s in this damper for the fourth storey maximum force of 369 15 kn occurs at 8 03 s and a minimum force of 404 60 kn takes place at 8 22 s 4 4 stability the variations of the sliding surfaces s t for the fifth and fourth floor controllers are illustrated in fig 18 a and fig 18 b it can be seen that the sliding functions s t are not equal to 0 but the average values of the sliding functions s t tend to zero theoretically even though the sliding function should be zero i e s t 0 however due to the external disturbances seismic excitation there always exist deviations in the sliding function from the sliding surface and the sliding mode controller effectively reduces these deviations by driving the trajectory towards the sliding surface in fig 19 a and fig 19 b the phase planes for the top two stories of the jacket structure controlled by the smc are shown if we look at the resultant motion on the sliding surface or the phase plane trajectory plots it is observed that each of the trajectories slides towards its respective sliding surface at s 0 or the equilibrium point and hence it can be concluded that the closed loop system is stable during the reaching phase however period the system response is sensitive to seismic excitations 4 5 effect of sliding margin in the design of the sliding mode controller an assumed value of the sliding margin is taken however in order to investigate the sensitivity of this constant a parametric study is carried out by varying its value the result of this parametric variation is depicted in fig 20 the figure indicates that the performance of controller in terms of the response reduction of the structure does not vary with any change in the value of the sliding margin over a significantly large range thus it may be concluded that the controller is practically insensitive to this parameter which depends on the choice of the individual designer and therefore can be considered to be robust 4 6 effect of linearization of drag force in order to simplify the analysis procedure it is a general practice to linearize a non linear system and replace it with an equivalent linearized one in the time domain analysis procedures the nonlinear dynamic systems are usually solved using iterative methods and the solutions may take longer time to complete due to convergence problems linearization is done especially when frequency domain analyses and stochastic analyses of structures are carried out in order to have a proper understanding of the behaviour of the jacket platform it is necessary to study the effect of this linearization on the structure in addition to this a semi active controller is designed and the values of different design parameters are determined based on the response feedback of the structure hence it is evident that the linearization of the drag force has an effect on the performance of a semiactive controller when the actual external excitation or the actual water structure interaction phenomenon is non linear in nature its linearization may result in an erroneous design of the controller which may eventually lead to its poor performance in terms of response reduction a comparative study has been done showing the difference in the structural responses and controller performance when the structure is subjected to non linear and linearized drag forces the effect of the drag force is shown with the help of a virtual diagram fig 3 where the drag force is idealized as dampers installed at various storey levels of the offshore jacket platform the role of the drag force in an offshore jacket structure is same as that of a damper in any structure so the removal of drag force would have same effect as that of the removal of damper from the structure it is evident from fig 21 that there is an increase in response when the structure is analysed without the drag force and also when the drag force is linearized as compared to that with nonlinear drag force the removal of drag force has the same impact on the structure as that of removal of dampers from the structure thus increasing the response of the structure the figures show that out of the two cases the increase in response is more for the linearized case a comparison of tables 4 and 6 can well explain the effect of linearization of drag forces on the responses of an offshore jacket platform when subjected to various earthquakes the responses of the jacket structure after the linearization of the drag force are found to much higher for the earthquake ground accelerations as compared to that of non linear drag force the response quantities shown in tables 5 and 7 are compared and it can be concluded that both the controlled and uncontrolled absolute maximum values of all these response quantities namely displacement velocity and rms displacement at each storey level increase when the structure is analysed using linearized drag force however in most of the cases this increase due to linearization is more for the controlled responses of the jacket platform the average increases for the above mentioned response quantities are around 600 300 25 and 650 respectively for the uncontrolled responses and 800 400 30 and 900 respectively for controlled responses therefore the linearization technique gives conservative results i e the increase in controlled responses is more when linearized drag force is considered the overestimation shown is maximum for displacement and velocity as a result of this when the performance of the controller for the two cases tables 5 and 7 considering nonlinear drag and considering linearized drag are compared the results indicate decrease in effectiveness of controllers in terms of percentage control in the linearized case for almost all the responses the performance of the controller shows maximum deterioration for displacement and velocity even almost 100 decreases in some cases this is because of the increase in controlled displacement and velocity values as mentioned before due to drag force linearization is more than the corresponding increase in case of the uncontrolled values when the control forces developed are compared the time history plot as given in fig 22 shows that maximum values of the control forces in the two cases one with non linear drag and the other without any drag force are comparable there is however an increase of about 100 in the control force developed when the drag force is linearized the system with non linear drag force showed better response control as compared to system with linearized drag force the above mentioned decrease in controller effectiveness may be attributed to the fact that both uncontrolled and controlled responses increase due to linearization of drag forces but the increase in the controlled responses is more than the increase in the uncontrolled responses 5 conclusions a decentralized sliding mode control algorithm using mr dampers is developed to mitigate the seismically induced vibrations in an offshore jacket platform numerical results indicate that the number of mr dampers and their placements have significant effect on the performance of the controller in terms of the percentage reduction of responses the sliding mode controller effectively reduces the deviations in the sliding function values by driving the trajectory towards the sliding surface and it can be inferred that system is stable the hysteric cycles indicate that the energy induced by the earthquake ground motion is effectively dissipated and hence the share of structural elements in energy absorption is reduced the performance of controller does not show any sensitivity to any variation in the sliding margin which depends on the choice of the individual designer and the controller can therefore be considered to be robust the effect of linearization of the drag force is investigated by comparing the performance of the controller for two cases with nonlinear drag and with linearized drag force the results indicate that evaluation of the controller effectiveness is conservative when drag forces are linearized since a decrease in percentage reduction is observed for almost all the responses this is predominant for displacement and velocity the above mentioned decrease in controller effectiveness may be attributed to the fact that both uncontrolled and controlled responses increase due to linearization of drag forces but the increase in the controlled responses is more than the increase in the uncontrolled responses in view of the above it may further be noted that the linearization technique gives conservative estimates of the structural responses 
23586,site specific wave data can be used to improve the realism of tank test conditions and resulting outputs if this data is recorded in the presence of a current then the combined conditions must be re created to ensure wave power wavelength and steepness are correctly represented in a tank in this paper we explore the impacts of currents on the wave field and demonstrate a simple effective methodology for re creating combined wave current scenarios regular waves a parametric unidirectional spectrum and a complex site specific directional sea state were re created with current velocities representing 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 m s full scale waves were generated at a number of angles relative to the current providing observations of both collinear and non collinear wave current interactions wave amplitudes transformed by the current were measured and corrected linearly ensuring desired frequency and wavenumber spectra in the presence of current were obtained this empirical method proved effective after a single iteration frequency spectra were within 3 of desired and wave heights normally within 1 the generation measurement correction procedure presented enables effective re creation of complex wave current scenarios this capability will increase the realism of tank testing and help de risk devices prior to deployment at sea keywords wave current interactions site specific wave conditions directional wave spectra directional spectrum measurement tank testing 1 introduction tank testing of physical scale models is an essential element in the development of marine renewable technologies and techniques undertaking this testing in laboratories provides a controlled repeatable and low risk environment where technological concepts and operational techniques may be developed ingram et al 2011 a five stage structured development plan for wave energy systems was outlined by holmes and nielsen 2010 which can be related to the widely used technology readiness level trl concept developed initially by nasa mankins 1995 using scaled sea conditions based on open sea measurements at wave energy sites when tank testing renewable energy devices particularly at mid and later stage trl levels can improve understanding of device performance prior to deployment at sea the aim of this work is to explore the impacts of currents on the wave field and to demonstrate an effective approach to include currents in scale model testing thus representing the combined conditions appropriately a site specific directional sea state is used to illustrate this methodology derived from the billia croo wave test site at the european marine energy centre emec experiments were carried out in the circular wave basin of the flowave ocean energy research facility enabling both waves and current to be generated in all directions currents change the physical form of waves as discussed by peregrine 1976 and others although the wave period remains constant waves become steeper when they encounter an opposing current a combination of both the wave height increasing and wavelength decreasing wave breaking will occur as the steepness approaches a critical limit and faster currents prevent upstream wave propagation completely i e wave blocking with a following current the converse occurs and waves become less steep for waves at an angle to the current there is also refraction of the wave direction to consider several experimental studies have been published on the influence of currents on waves early studies including thomas 1981 kemp and simons 1982 1983 used hydraulic flumes to investigate collinear wave current interaction for regular waves the main focus was the influence of waves and bed roughness on the current profile although modification of the waves by the current was also included this experimental work on regular waves was extended to consider uni directional spectra with collinear currents by hedges et al 1985 and chakrabarti and johnson 1995 adding more complexity nwogu 1993 and guedes soares et al 2000 looked at the influence of currents on directional spectra both studies were carried out in wave basins with a single bank of wavemakers with nozzles in front to generate current so considered spectra with a predominantly following current mean wave directions of 0 15 30 and 45 relative to the current were tested by nwogu 1993 although any modification of the frequency spectra were not reported as far as the authors are aware the research presented below is the first comprehensive study of oblique wave current interaction measured site wave data may be used to produce scaled sea states that capture spectral complexity and directional features not effectively represented by standard parametric spectra and spreading functions as discussed in draycott et al 2015 this site data typically gathered by a wave buoy may have been measured in the presence of current this current is not typically reproduced in the test tank and therefore wave power and steepness of the sea states will be misrepresented this has potentially large implications on the assumed resource and on the validity of observed device response as discussed in section 2 the rest of the paper is organised into four sections in section 2 we explore the impact of a current on the wave field including implications for power and steepness if this current is omitted during testing the experimental methodology is given in section 3 with results in section 4 some discussion of these findings is then presented in section 5 2 the effect of current on the wave field currents transform the wave field including wave height and length as mentioned in section1 this alters the form of the frequency and wavenumber spectra along with the power available the impact of tides on wave power resource has been investigated using a numerical model by hashemi et al 2014 this work showed the impact of tides on wave power resource could exceed 10 at sites with currents of around 1 5 m s other papers such as saruwatari et al 2013 suggest this effect may be as large as 60 in 3 m s currents however current induced wavelength and group velocity changes appear to have been ignored this leads to an over estimation as described in section 2 3 analogous to the described wave buoy scenario wave buoys including the datawell waverider buoys deployed by emec typically measure heave pitch and roll the resulting frequency spectra are calculated from the heave motions earle 1996 whilst the directionality is inferred through cross correlation of the three signals if a current is present at the site the sea surface elevations and hence calculated frequency spectrum will therefore be altered but without knowing the corresponding change in wavelength if it is assumed there was no current wavenumber spectra calculated for the recorded frequency spectra will be incorrect as will steepness and power this has potentially large implications for the assumed resource available along with the form of the waves as explored below additionally if a spectrum is replicated in a test environment without current this would fail to capture the true nature of the site conditions 2 1 calculation of available power and steepness for waves in the absence of current the wavenumber for each frequency can be obtained from the dispersion relation eq 1 with corresponding wavenumber spectrum s k and group velocities c g calculated from eq 2 and the measured frequency spectrum s f 1 ω g k tanh k h 2 s k s f c g f 2 π c g f 1 2 ω k 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where ω is the angular frequency k the wavenumber and h water depth the total power in a wave spectrum p is calculated from eq 3 integrating component wave power 3 p p f δ f where p f ρ g s f c g f significant steepness s p is calculated from the wavelength associated with the peak of the wavenumber spectrum l p and eq 4 this version of peak wavelength has been used rather than the wavelength associated with the peak frequency for two reasons firstly the wavelength associated with the peak of the wavenumber spectrum does not always equal that obtained from f p as discussed in plant 2009 the peak energy lies at the wavelength associated with the wavenumber peak so using this value provides a more representative figure for the true steepness of a sea state secondly this definition allows for a consistent comparison of steepness between cases with and without current h m 0 is the significant wave height 4 s p h m 0 l p 2 2 transformation of wave spectra in the presence of current in the presence of current wavelength is no longer related to frequency through the standard dispersion relation eq 1 a modified relation eq 5 is used instead jonsson 1990 in the following equations α is the angle between wave and current propagation directions and subscripts 1 and 0 refer to regions with and without current respectively importantly the wavenumber in the presence of a current k 1 will differ from k 0 5 ω k 1 u cos α g k 1 tanh k 1 h using a linear assumption the amplitudes of each frequency component a f are given by 6 a f 2 s f δ f the current modified component wave amplitudes can be calculated assuming conservation of a quantity termed wave action jonsson 1990 defined as 7 x e c g r u cos α ω r 0 where e is the wave energy and x the direction of wave propagation the subscript r denotes variables relative to the current i e assuming a frame of reference moving at the same velocity as the current the relative angular velocities ω r and group velocities c g r can be expressed as 8 ω r g k 1 tanh k 1 h 9 c g r 1 2 ω r k 1 1 2 k 1 h sinh 2 k 1 h equating wave action between regions with a steady current u and with no current eq 7 can be rearranged to relate the wave heights smith 1997 giving component amplitudes as 10 a 1 a 0 c g 0 c g r 1 u cos α 1 1 u cos α c g r 1 the transformed frequency spectrum can be reconstructed using eq 6 taking a 1 f to get s 1 f this results in the same transformation as that formulated in chakrabarti and johnson 1995 the wavenumber spectra power available and wave steepness in the presence of a current can be calculated via eqs 2 4 using the relevant terms with current as appropriate 2 3 power and steepness assumed if wavelength and group velocity change omitted calculating power and steepness for waves in the presence of a current using the method in section 2 1 will give incorrect results if the wavenumber transformation described in section 2 2 is not also included this situation could arise when using measurements from a wave buoy where there is no knowledge of the current and thus the wavelength change the measured transformed spectrum s 1 f has associated wavenumbers k 1 f with the assumption of no current wavenumbers k 0 f are calculated using eq 1 rather than using eq 5 to get k 1 f this assumption leads to incorrect calculation of group velocities and wavenumber spectra hence the power and steepness will also be incorrect to demonstrate the effect of current on both the transformed and assumed spectra a pierson moskowitz pm spectrum with h m 0 of 5 m and t p of 8 s is used to show the effect over a wide range of frequencies this has been analysed with both opposing and following current velocities of 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 m s the significant wave height is found to increase 27 6 with 1 m s opposing current and decrease 17 2 for 1 m s following current the transformation of frequency and wavenumber spectra are shown in fig 1 along with the wavenumber spectrum that would be assumed without the knowledge of the current present in opposing flow waves increase in steepness and thus spectral magnitude increases with associated reduction in wavelength shown as a shift to higher wavenumbers the opposite is true of the following current conditions for the assumed case with no current there is no shift in wavenumber and hence the steepness change will be under estimated in addition the group velocity is unaltered which causes an over estimation of the change in power this is shown in fig 2 where the maximum discrepancy is the 1 m s opposing case under estimating steepness by 18 6 and over estimating power by 26 9 this demonstrates the importance of measuring currents at a site in order to obtain a realistic resource assessment and site characterisation when tank testing with realistic site conditions the associated current should be included so that conditions mimic the site and results inferred from the testing are representative the correct wavenumber for each frequency component cannot be attained without the current but are implicitly correct if the current and scaled depth are accurately reproduced it is important the frequency spectrum is correct in order to obtain the desired wavenumber spectra power and steepness at flowave this requires a correction procedure as a result of the current transformation so input amplitudes must be altered this process is detailed in section 3 4 3 and demonstrated for a range of combined wave current conditions in section 4 3 experimental method 3 1 the flowave ocean energy research facility the experimental measurements presented here were made at the flowave ocean energy research facility located at the university of edinburgh the facility is comprised of a circular 25 m diameter combined wave and current test basin encircled by 168 active absorbing force feedback wavemakers the water depth in the test area is 2 0 m a re circulating flow system is created using 28 impeller units mounted in the plenum chamber beneath the floor robinson et al 2015 these enable a predominantly straight flow to be achieved in any direction across the central test area noble et al 2015 these unique design features remove any inherent limitation on both wave and current direction enabling the re creation of complex directional sea states in combination with current the modification of waves by a current is of particular relevance at the flowave facility where the waves are generated in a region of still water around the circumference of the tank and then interact with the current which is injected through the floor robinson et al 2015 in order to produce the desired wave height in the central test area of the tank with the presence of a current a correction factor must be applied to the wave generated in still water as discussed in section 3 4 3 3 2 site characterisation and sea state choice the european marine energy centre emec is an open water test facility for wave and tidal energy devices with both full scale and nursery sites based in orkney uk over the last 12 years emec has gained vast experience in both device installation and resource measurement at these sites directional wave data from the full scale grid connected wave test site at billia croo have been made available albeit without corresponding data on currents this emec dataset contains multiple years of half hourly directional sea states from january 2010 to january 2014 rather than choosing an individual spectrum for this case study outputs from draycott et al 2014 2015 have been used the aim of this previous work was to produce a small subset of statistically representative spectra from the same dataset whilst retaining the sea state complexity and directionality the use of clustering algorithms was of particular interest as they enable the consideration of the whole spectral form in the classification in draycott et al 2015 40 representative spectra were created from two years of data january 2010 to january 2012 around 35 000 sea states using a variety of methods a method was chosen which maximised intra group similarity and inter group distinctness utilising a combined binning clustering approach one of the resulting sea states was chosen as an example for reproduction representing approximately 0 14 of the dataset this was chosen as it represents an interesting case of a multi modal sea state with reasonable directional spreading the sea state has a significant wave height h m 0 of 3 53 m a peak period t p of 20 s and mean power p of 87 6 kw m wave crest the frequency and directional spectra along with the weighted directional spreading function dsf are shown in fig 3 the water depth at the wave buoy location is 52 m relating to intermediate water depth for the majority of wave components present with no tidal records available for the site the atlas of uk marine renewable energy abp mer 2012 has been used to obtain the peak tidal velocity at the billia croo site which is expected to be between 0 25 and 0 5 m s 0 5 1 0 knots 3 3 test plan wave current scenarios the wave current correction procedure was applied for wave conditions of increasing complexity tests were conducted with regular waves a long crested parametric jonswap spectrum and the non parametric directional sea state derived from the emec data to facilitate comparison the height and period of the parametric waves were chosen to roughly match the peak of the recorded sea state see table 1 test lengths were specified as a power of 2 s to facilitate frequency domain analysis with longer tests used to capture the detail of the directional spectra the three different sea states regular parametric and non parametric were tested at various relative angles to the current direction with three current velocities the chosen sea states must be scaled before re creation in the tank froude scaling was used to ensure the correct ratio between inertial and gravitational forces which are dominant in free surface waves when choosing a scale one must consider the ratio of tank to site depth along with the wave generation limits of the tank the flowave facility has a test water depth of 2 m and is optimised for wave generation at around 2 s period which corresponds to scales around 1 20 to 1 40 for wave climates typically of interest to renewable energy for waves in intermediate depth water spectra need to be scaled by the depth ratio between tank and site if this is not done although the energy distribution across frequency and direction will be correct the resulting wavenumber spectra will not this results in a frequency dependent wavelength discrepancy as there are no wave generation limits at the desired scale the depth ratio of 1 26 can be used without issue as well as scaling the wave spectra the tidal current must also be scaled using the same relationship at 1 26 froude scale the site estimates correspond to between 0 05 and 0 1 m s in the tank an additional velocity of 0 2 m s was also used to demonstrate the method effectiveness in faster currents where the wave current interaction is greater previous published work on wave current interactions has largely focussed on collinear cases waves either propagating in the same direction as the current or directly opposing it the capability of flowave permits the testing of non collinear cases with the waves at an arbitrary angle to the current direction waves were generated at relative angles to the current of 0 following π 4 π 2 perpendicular 3 π 4 and π opposing for the regular wave tests an additional four intermediate angles were also measured a range of angles were tested to demonstrate the applicability of the method however when considering a real site these would be chosen based on the wave fetch and tide directions 3 4 test method the sea states defined in table 1 were initially validated in the tank without the presence of a current confirming that they have been correctly generated prior to observing and analysing the transformation with current current velocities were set based on a depth averaged calibration from measurements taken in the centre of the tank it is noted that there is some spatial variation with reduced velocity towards the outside of the basin due to the method of producing current in the circular tank noble et al 2015 the potential implications of this are explored in section 5 2 velocity measurement using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv ensured that the current had reached an equilibrium prior to wave generation 3 4 1 directional sea state generation deterministic waves are generated at flowave providing a very high degree of repeatability ingram et al 2014 to generate a directional spectrum using this deterministic approach the single summation rather than double summation method is used depicted in fig 4 this avoids a phenomenon called phase locking miles and funke 1989 whereby waves with the same frequency but different directions interact and cause spatial patterns resulting in a non ergodic wave field to avoid this the initial frequency increments δ f can be split up further to create sub frequency increments δ f δ f n θ as shown in pascal 2012 these new frequency increments still within the original frequency bins now have a unique wave propagation direction associated with each of them the single summation approach used also aids in both the sea state measurement and the implementation of correction factors when analysing results in the frequency domain each measured component amplitude can be identified and operated on individually but only if the fast fourier transform fft bins match the generation frequencies this is key to the correction method and means that the appropriate correction factors can be identified and applied for each of the sub frequencies essentially this allows different correction factors to be applied for the various relative current angles which is vital for correcting directional seas with current the directional sea states presented here have a repeat time t of 2048 s defining the sub frequency increments δ f to be 1 2048 hz in order to achieved the desired frequency increments the scaled spectrum was interpolated to create 64 frequency bins between 0 and 1 hz and 32 directional bins from 0 π covering the region with significant energy content in the directional spectrum n f 64 n θ 32 re defining the directional spectrum for use in the single summation method gives the required frequency increments of 11 δ f δ f n θ 1 n f n θ 1 t 1 2048 h z 3 4 2 directional wave measurement surface elevations are measured at flowave using multiplexed two wire resistance type wave gauges providing point measurements at a sample frequency of 128 hz in order to calculate component wave directions and infer directional spectra these wave gauges are deployed in a carefully designed array draycott et al 2016 shown in fig 5 a the array has been chosen to encompass desirable spacings for the analysis and is based on optimising the co array uniformity over the angle and magnitude range of interest this co array is shown in fig 5b providing favourable separations for the calculation of directional spectra a phase time path difference ptpd approach fernandes et al 2000 esteva 1976 has been used to calculate component angles and directional spectra this method uses the measured phase differences and known separations between gauges to infer the wave direction at each frequency and provides a single wave angle per frequency through triangulation draycott et al 2016 has shown this method to be a highly effective approach for measuring directional spectra when combined with single summation wave generation for measuring directional wave characteristics in currents this approach has also found to be much more effective as discussed in section 5 3 and as such has been applied here in addition to reducing directional spectrum reconstruction error the ptpd outputs provide individual component wave angles opening up the possibility of effectively assessing wave refraction in current 3 4 3 correction procedure to produce waves of a specified height in combination with a current an amplitude based correction factor needs to be applied to the wavemaker input for a directional spectrum it is necessary to determine this factor for every frequency and direction component as a result of using a single summation method see section 3 4 1 the amplitude of each wave component with unique frequency and direction a i f i θ i can be corrected these correction factor are assumed linear taken as the inverse of the change in component amplitude as a result of the interaction with the current field discussed in section 2 2 and are calculated empirically the input wave spectrum is generated in the tank with current measured and the resulting component amplitudes compared with those desired eq 12 the correction based on observed discrepancy between the desired and measured directional spectra was multiplicatively applied to the input spectrum and the process repeated as necessary in an iterative manner until the measured spectrum was acceptably correct defined in this case as a mean spectral error ε 5 eq 13 12 c f e m

a function of relative angle and current velocity can be seen in fig 6 a as expected the observed transformation increases with larger current velocities and for a given current a larger relative angle corresponds to an increase in wave height this change has been compared to wave current interaction theories both linear smith 1997 and non linear second order baddour and song 1990 zaman and baddour 2011 the observed transformation is larger than predicted by either as can be seen in fig 7 this highlights that applying theoretical correction factors in this context is not particularly effective another interesting observation is the reduction in wave height with increasing current velocity when waves and current are perpendicular which is discussed further in section 5 1 from preliminary results of other regular wave cases noble 2017 this under prediction of wave transformation by theory appears to be consistent for all wave frequency steepness combinations tested the effect of wave steepness also appears to be fairly insignificant in terms of relative wave height change whilst frequency dominates both measured transformations and deviations from theory the error in wave height following empirical correction is shown in fig 6b with fig 6c showing the apparent angular change for all velocities and relative angles the resulting measured wave heights were within 0 7 of the desired the measured angular change is also relatively small yet displays no obvious pattern with respect to relative angle and current velocity the presence of a current reduces measurement accuracy through increased reflections gauge vibrations bending etc making it difficult to isolate small refraction effects from this increased error it is however evident that any refraction effects are very small at these velocities and so have not been corrected for any of the sea states this along with other practical considerations is discussed further in section 5 interestingly there is an apparent angular offset when there is no current present these calculated angles are a function of the measured phase differences and assumed gauge positions in addition to small physical position errors of individual gauges or the array reflections can significantly alter the measured phase differences and resulting apparent angles these reflections which exist with and without current present are likely the dominant cause of this apparent angular error 4 2 uni directional parametric spectrum the observed transformation of the parametric spectra is shown in fig 8 along with the deviation in energy density compared to the desired before and after correction clearly the same trend is seen as with the regular waves with larger transformations in the presence of larger currents and larger wave heights with increasing angle analysing this change in energy density it can be inferred that although the majority of the change is a result of wave current interaction there is also significant variation due to reflections particularly affecting the higher frequencies the magnitude of these variations are a function of the reduced absorption effectiveness in the presence of larger currents the reason for this spiky variation at higher frequencies is due to incident and reflected wave components at a given frequency being in or out of phase at the gauge array location regardless of the source of the frequency dependent variation the corrected deviation shows that the spectrum has been effectively corrected using a linear approach in a single iteration all wave current angle scenarios were corrected to give a final weighted error of less than 3 4 3 non parametric directional spectrum similar to the parametric outputs found in fig 8 the frequency spectrum transformation and correction for the non parametric emec derived sea state are shown in fig 9 again only a single iteration was required to achieve these results despite this sea state having significant directional spreading associated similar magnitude of transformation is observed to the parametric case along with analogous influence of reflections the corrected frequency spectra are also all within 3 of the desired demonstrating that the linear correction procedure applied to the sub frequency angular components is just as effective fig 10 shows the final corrected sea states output frequency spectra along with weighted dsf are shown for the three velocities and five relative angles the final directional spectrum output using the ptpd approach is shown for the base 0 1 m s case noting that the 0 05 m s and 0 2 m s results appear very similar the final sea states re iterate that the frequency spectra have been effectively corrected for all velocity angle combinations and in general so have the directional spectra and mean dsf directional errors are larger with increasing current velocity which is clear when assessing the weighted dsf errors with zero current the weighted dsf error was 6 95 whereas in 0 05 0 1 and 0 2 m s current the mean errors over all angles are 13 3 14 3 and 18 5 respectively although this is a significant increase it is felt that the majority of this is not refraction induced and instead is a product of increased measurement error combined with the way the error is calculated this is discussed further in section 5 3 5 discussion 5 1 observed change in wave height and spectra although the main aim of this work is to demonstrate the effective re creation of directional spectra with current one of the interesting outcomes is the observation of non collinear wave current interactions all results show larger wave transformation in the presence of higher current velocities and an increase in wave amplitude with increasing relative angle as would be expected the magnitude of the regular wave transformation however was much larger than expected as shown in fig 7 the change in wave height regular or significant with respect to the current condition was observed to be comparable for each of the sea states this is shown in fig 11 and is largely a result of all sea states having similar frequency and steepness values it may be expected that the directional sea state would have a smaller range in measured wave heights due to different wave components propagating at different relative angles however this proved not to be the case which is clear when assessing the observed wave height for the emec sea state in 0 2 m s current at a relative angle of π the cause of this is unknown but may be a consequence of reflections causing a net constructive effect over the wave gauge array area these reflections are dependent on frequency flow velocity and relative angle as expected from the similar wave height transformations the spectra also display a larger transformation than predicted by linear theory section 2 these discrepancies may be a result of tank specific wave generation issues in the presence of a current discussed further in section 5 2 so caution must be used before assuming that these results are representative of pure wave current interaction interestingly however the same effect has been observed by nwogu 1993 chakrabarti and johnson 1995 guedes soares et al 2000 although this does not resolve the cause of the difference it does suggest that at least in part these larger transformations may be a pure wave current interaction effect interestingly wave height was found to decrease in all cases where the mean wave angle was perpendicular to the current with a greater reduction at higher velocities with the current running water passes through the turning vanes and wave energy may be lost via the current return path under the floor this is analogous to having a finite crest length in open water with the perpendicular current causing wave crests to stretch out along their length thus reducing wave height the theories considered assume plane waves with infinitely long crests so predict no change in wave height with a perpendicular current 5 2 assessment of correction procedure the amplitude correction procedure applied has proven to be effective for all sea states providing frequency spectrum errors of less than 3 in all cases consequently the resulting wave heights were found to be very close to the desired for the regular uni directional parametric and non parametric emec sea states the mean wave height discrepancy over all velocity angle combinations were found to be 0 27 0 42 and 0 91 respectively maximum errors of 0 67 1 11 and 1 38 the correction factor although assumed linear includes a number of different factors of which the proportional influence remains unknown namely 1 superposition of wave and current fields 2 energy transfer between wave and current fields 3 increased reflections with larger currents which is relative to the array location 4 spatial variation of current in the tank and 5 paddle response to presence of current the favourable results show that although current effects on the wave field at flowave are inherently complex and non linear the variation in relative wave deformation as a result of a modest change in input wave amplitude can effectively be approximated as a linear process this is a useful output from this work although limits to the validity of this will need to be identified through additional testing with steeper waves and higher current velocities the wave current interaction theories do not include all of these factors which may account for the discrepancies in fig 7 the linear theory only accounts for the first while the non linear theory also partially accounts for the second factors 3 5 are facility specific and thus cannot be dealt with by general theories 5 3 measurement of wave directionality 5 3 1 measurement of component wave angles in current component angles are measured using the ptpd approach as implemented by draycott et al 2016 each gauge triad provides an estimate of wave angle for each of the frequency components based on the measured phase differences from an fft a circular kernel density estimate 250 bins is then applied to the 56 individual triad estimates in an aim to identify the true incident angle for each component this approach has been shown to provide very good estimates of incident wave angle without the presence of current typically identifying the correct angle within π 90 noting the directional bin widths are π 32 this usually provides good resulting spectral estimates in the presence of currents estimates of wave angle are not so accurate this is partly due to additional measurement uncertainty from a number of sources run up on gauges turbulence and vortex induced vibration viv the presence of the current also causes inconsistent bending to occur in the gauges meaning the assumed gauge positions are somewhat inaccurate and importantly wire separations can be variable additionally reflection levels are higher in the presence of currents which also alter the perceived phases particularly when the reflections are not opposing the incident components the cumulative effect of this is increased uncertainty in the angular estimates fig 12 shows the ptpd angle calculation outputs for the uni directional parametric spectrum noting that it is much easier to observe and analyse than the non parametric directional sea state it is clear that the overall sea state direction is generally identified well with directional bin size of π 32 a measured deviation of just π 64 from the desired angle would result in the energy being attributed to a different directional bin for that frequency component this happens relatively frequently in the presence of current as can be seen in fig 12 causing apparently large errors to arise through a measurement discrepancy of less than three degrees this results in the dsf and e f θ in fig 9 showing significant deviation even though the underlying errors themselves are quite minimal to get an error metric not related to bin size a net weighted angular error has been defined in eq 14 with the observed outputs for both the parametric and non parametric emec sea shown in fig 13 14 θ e r r o r θ o b s i θ 0 i a i a i as refraction levels are expected to be in the order of a few degrees isolating what is refraction and what is simply increased measurement error has proved difficult any significant refraction should however manifest itself as a negative weighted angular change in fig 13 for all non collinear cases as there is no clear indication that this is the case it is assumed that the refraction levels in these tests are low enough that they do not need to be corrected if this work was to be extended to tests with larger currents it may be that the refraction cannot be ignored requiring improvements to the measurement system this may take the form of stiffer wave gauges or an alternative measurement system to reduce vibration and deflection in the presence of current this would allow the implementation of an iterative procedure to correct for the observed refraction 5 3 2 relative performance of ptpd approach in the presence of a current the increased measurement errors mean that the ptpd outputs have some uncertainty associated although it has been inferred that the actual discrepancy is likely to be small this still means that the true directional spectrum generated remains unknown this uncertainty however is still significantly smaller than if typical directional spectrum reconstruction methods were used this is demonstrated in fig 14 where the dsf outputs for the base 0 1 m s cases are shown for the ptpd extended maximum likelihood method emlm and extended maximum entropy method emep approaches in fig 14 it appears that other than the emep reconstruction at 3 π 4 the emep and emlm approaches fail to effectively characterise the dsfs having a non zero magnitude for all angles this is clearly not the case and is likely due to the limitations of these curve fitting methods trying to fit to small reflections along with additional reconstruction errors as there is only significant energy within a range of π 4 and the array is in the tank centre meaning component reflections are opposing incident there should only be a very small dsf component 1 4 size of incident peak corresponding to 10 20 reflection opposing the incident rather than the observed constant energy content the poor performance of the emep and emlm approaches in these instances mean that the resulting reconstructions would clearly not be suitable to use as a basis for subsequent directional correction despite the ptpd approach reducing errors significantly identification of refraction effects with these low velocities and wave gauges available is still error prone it is thought however that using this approach with stiffer gauges will prove effective at measuring dsfs accurately in current with the additional advantage that component angles have been calculated and can now inform a correction procedure 5 4 application and implications for physical testing the results of this work demonstrate that site specific directional spectra can be re created with current at flowave it also highlights the importance of including any currents present when aiming to re create site conditions and the value in obtaining measurements of current velocity when carrying out resource assessment or carrying out full scale testing when re creating site conditions for tank testing including measured or representative currents can help explore the envelope of expected responses this will in turn provide more insightful and realistic device and mooring loads including both those incurred through the presence of the current directly as well as those resulting from the influence of the current on the wave field if combined conditions are specified then the input spectrum will need to be corrected so that the desired spectrum is obtained at the device location thus appropriately representing the power available with the current included the correct wavenumber spectrum will also be obtained ensuring that wave amplitudes along with wavelength steepness and celerity match those at the site due to the significant effect current can have on the perceived power and assumed wavelengths it is clearly advantageous to measure current velocities when carrying out resource assessment this is also the case when carrying out full scale testing as it enables true context to be placed on the results for example if characterising a wec performance by h m 0 and t e a device sensitive to wavelength and steepness will respond very differently in the presence of current despite having comparable h m 0 t e values in addition to the available power being misinterpreted the level of sea state complexity generally increases as a concept advances through technology readiness levels trls ingram et al 2011 early stage testing is typically limited to regular waves of varying frequency and height before advancing to standard parametric spectra both long and short crested the ability to produce combined wave current sea states especially with non parametric spectra will usually apply more to devices at advanced trls where a particular deployment site has been identified as such this ability to produce site specific combined sea states has the potential to extend and complement established development paths 6 conclusions a site specific non parametric directional spectrum has been obtained from emec and re created at 1 26 scale at the flowave ocean energy research facility with current velocities of 0 05 0 1 and 0 2 m s representing 0 5 1 and 2 knots full scale the studies conducted on complex directional wave fields in combination with currents within the flowave ocean energy research facility resulted in the following main findings the transformation of waves by current has been shown to have a significant impact on both the true wave power and steepness and on that which may be assumed without knowledge of the current field if the current present at the site is not included in tank testing incorrect power and wavenumber spectra will be generated and test results will not be representative of real site conditions an empirical correction procedure has been used to correct this sea state along with equivalent regular waves and uni directional parametric spectrum in the presence of currents from multiple relative angles the linear correction procedure applied proved effective after a single iteration providing corrected frequency spectra all within 3 of the desired and wave heights normally within 1 refraction effects were found to be minimal at the velocities tested although angle estimates prove to be error prone in current the ptpd approach provides much improved outputs over either the emlm or emep methods in this process non collinear wave current interactions were observed for each of the wave cases the measured wave transformation was larger than expected from theory which may partially be facility specific effects resulting from the method of generating currents and absorbing waves at flowave acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the energy technologies institute and rcuk energy programme for funding this research

23586,site specific wave data can be used to improve the realism of tank test conditions and resulting outputs if this data is recorded in the presence of a current then the combined conditions must be re created to ensure wave power wavelength and steepness are correctly represented in a tank in this paper we explore the impacts of currents on the wave field and demonstrate a simple effective methodology for re creating combined wave current scenarios regular waves a parametric unidirectional spectrum and a complex site specific directional sea state were re created with current velocities representing 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 m s full scale waves were generated at a number of angles relative to the current providing observations of both collinear and non collinear wave current interactions wave amplitudes transformed by the current were measured and corrected linearly ensuring desired frequency and wavenumber spectra in the presence of current were obtained this empirical method proved effective after a single iteration frequency spectra were within 3 of desired and wave heights normally within 1 the generation measurement correction procedure presented enables effective re creation of complex wave current scenarios this capability will increase the realism of tank testing and help de risk devices prior to deployment at sea keywords wave current interactions site specific wave conditions directional wave spectra directional spectrum measurement tank testing 1 introduction tank testing of physical scale models is an essential element in the development of marine renewable technologies and techniques undertaking this testing in laboratories provides a controlled repeatable and low risk environment where technological concepts and operational techniques may be developed ingram et al 2011 a five stage structured development plan for wave energy systems was outlined by holmes and nielsen 2010 which can be related to the widely used technology readiness level trl concept developed initially by nasa mankins 1995 using scaled sea conditions based on open sea measurements at wave energy sites when tank testing renewable energy devices particularly at mid and later stage trl levels can improve understanding of device performance prior to deployment at sea the aim of this work is to explore the impacts of currents on the wave field and to demonstrate an effective approach to include currents in scale model testing thus representing the combined conditions appropriately a site specific directional sea state is used to illustrate this methodology derived from the billia croo wave test site at the european marine energy centre emec experiments were carried out in the circular wave basin of the flowave ocean energy research facility enabling both waves and current to be generated in all directions currents change the physical form of waves as discussed by peregrine 1976 and others although the wave period remains constant waves become steeper when they encounter an opposing current a combination of both the wave height increasing and wavelength decreasing wave breaking will occur as the steepness approaches a critical limit and faster currents prevent upstream wave propagation completely i e wave blocking with a following current the converse occurs and waves become less steep for waves at an angle to the current there is also refraction of the wave direction to consider several experimental studies have been published on the influence of currents on waves early studies including thomas 1981 kemp and simons 1982 1983 used hydraulic flumes to investigate collinear wave current interaction for regular waves the main focus was the influence of waves and bed roughness on the current profile although modification of the waves by the current was also included this experimental work on regular waves was extended to consider uni directional spectra with collinear currents by hedges et al 1985 and chakrabarti and johnson 1995 adding more complexity nwogu 1993 and guedes soares et al 2000 looked at the influence of currents on directional spectra both studies were carried out in wave basins with a single bank of wavemakers with nozzles in front to generate current so considered spectra with a predominantly following current mean wave directions of 0 15 30 and 45 relative to the current were tested by nwogu 1993 although any modification of the frequency spectra were not reported as far as the authors are aware the research presented below is the first comprehensive study of oblique wave current interaction measured site wave data may be used to produce scaled sea states that capture spectral complexity and directional features not effectively represented by standard parametric spectra and spreading functions as discussed in draycott et al 2015 this site data typically gathered by a wave buoy may have been measured in the presence of current this current is not typically reproduced in the test tank and therefore wave power and steepness of the sea states will be misrepresented this has potentially large implications on the assumed resource and on the validity of observed device response as discussed in section 2 the rest of the paper is organised into four sections in section 2 we explore the impact of a current on the wave field including implications for power and steepness if this current is omitted during testing the experimental methodology is given in section 3 with results in section 4 some discussion of these findings is then presented in section 5 2 the effect of current on the wave field currents transform the wave field including wave height and length as mentioned in section1 this alters the form of the frequency and wavenumber spectra along with the power available the impact of tides on wave power resource has been investigated using a numerical model by hashemi et al 2014 this work showed the impact of tides on wave power resource could exceed 10 at sites with currents of around 1 5 m s other papers such as saruwatari et al 2013 suggest this effect may be as large as 60 in 3 m s currents however current induced wavelength and group velocity changes appear to have been ignored this leads to an over estimation as described in section 2 3 analogous to the described wave buoy scenario wave buoys including the datawell waverider buoys deployed by emec typically measure heave pitch and roll the resulting frequency spectra are calculated from the heave motions earle 1996 whilst the directionality is inferred through cross correlation of the three signals if a current is present at the site the sea surface elevations and hence calculated frequency spectrum will therefore be altered but without knowing the corresponding change in wavelength if it is assumed there was no current wavenumber spectra calculated for the recorded frequency spectra will be incorrect as will steepness and power this has potentially large implications for the assumed resource available along with the form of the waves as explored below additionally if a spectrum is replicated in a test environment without current this would fail to capture the true nature of the site conditions 2 1 calculation of available power and steepness for waves in the absence of current the wavenumber for each frequency can be obtained from the dispersion relation eq 1 with corresponding wavenumber spectrum s k and group velocities c g calculated from eq 2 and the measured frequency spectrum s f 1 ω g k tanh k h 2 s k s f c g f 2 π c g f 1 2 ω k 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where ω is the angular frequency k the wavenumber and h water depth the total power in a wave spectrum p is calculated from eq 3 integrating component wave power 3 p p f δ f where p f ρ g s f c g f significant steepness s p is calculated from the wavelength associated with the peak of the wavenumber spectrum l p and eq 4 this version of peak wavelength has been used rather than the wavelength associated with the peak frequency for two reasons firstly the wavelength associated with the peak of the wavenumber spectrum does not always equal that obtained from f p as discussed in plant 2009 the peak energy lies at the wavelength associated with the wavenumber peak so using this value provides a more representative figure for the true steepness of a sea state secondly this definition allows for a consistent comparison of steepness between cases with and without current h m 0 is the significant wave height 4 s p h m 0 l p 2 2 transformation of wave spectra in the presence of current in the presence of current wavelength is no longer related to frequency through the standard dispersion relation eq 1 a modified relation eq 5 is used instead jonsson 1990 in the following equations α is the angle between wave and current propagation directions and subscripts 1 and 0 refer to regions with and without current respectively importantly the wavenumber in the presence of a current k 1 will differ from k 0 5 ω k 1 u cos α g k 1 tanh k 1 h using a linear assumption the amplitudes of each frequency component a f are given by 6 a f 2 s f δ f the current modified component wave amplitudes can be calculated assuming conservation of a quantity termed wave action jonsson 1990 defined as 7 x e c g r u cos α ω r 0 where e is the wave energy and x the direction of wave propagation the subscript r denotes variables relative to the current i e assuming a frame of reference moving at the same velocity as the current the relative angular velocities ω r and group velocities c g r can be expressed as 8 ω r g k 1 tanh k 1 h 9 c g r 1 2 ω r k 1 1 2 k 1 h sinh 2 k 1 h equating wave action between regions with a steady current u and with no current eq 7 can be rearranged to relate the wave heights smith 1997 giving component amplitudes as 10 a 1 a 0 c g 0 c g r 1 u cos α 1 1 u cos α c g r 1 the transformed frequency spectrum can be reconstructed using eq 6 taking a 1 f to get s 1 f this results in the same transformation as that formulated in chakrabarti and johnson 1995 the wavenumber spectra power available and wave steepness in the presence of a current can be calculated via eqs 2 4 using the relevant terms with current as appropriate 2 3 power and steepness assumed if wavelength and group velocity change omitted calculating power and steepness for waves in the presence of a current using the method in section 2 1 will give incorrect results if the wavenumber transformation described in section 2 2 is not also included this situation could arise when using measurements from a wave buoy where there is no knowledge of the current and thus the wavelength change the measured transformed spectrum s 1 f has associated wavenumbers k 1 f with the assumption of no current wavenumbers k 0 f are calculated using eq 1 rather than using eq 5 to get k 1 f this assumption leads to incorrect calculation of group velocities and wavenumber spectra hence the power and steepness will also be incorrect to demonstrate the effect of current on both the transformed and assumed spectra a pierson moskowitz pm spectrum with h m 0 of 5 m and t p of 8 s is used to show the effect over a wide range of frequencies this has been analysed with both opposing and following current velocities of 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 m s the significant wave height is found to increase 27 6 with 1 m s opposing current and decrease 17 2 for 1 m s following current the transformation of frequency and wavenumber spectra are shown in fig 1 along with the wavenumber spectrum that would be assumed without the knowledge of the current present in opposing flow waves increase in steepness and thus spectral magnitude increases with associated reduction in wavelength shown as a shift to higher wavenumbers the opposite is true of the following current conditions for the assumed case with no current there is no shift in wavenumber and hence the steepness change will be under estimated in addition the group velocity is unaltered which causes an over estimation of the change in power this is shown in fig 2 where the maximum discrepancy is the 1 m s opposing case under estimating steepness by 18 6 and over estimating power by 26 9 this demonstrates the importance of measuring currents at a site in order to obtain a realistic resource assessment and site characterisation when tank testing with realistic site conditions the associated current should be included so that conditions mimic the site and results inferred from the testing are representative the correct wavenumber for each frequency component cannot be attained without the current but are implicitly correct if the current and scaled depth are accurately reproduced it is important the frequency spectrum is correct in order to obtain the desired wavenumber spectra power and steepness at flowave this requires a correction procedure as a result of the current transformation so input amplitudes must be altered this process is detailed in section 3 4 3 and demonstrated for a range of combined wave current conditions in section 4 3 experimental method 3 1 the flowave ocean energy research facility the experimental measurements presented here were made at the flowave ocean energy research facility located at the university of edinburgh the facility is comprised of a circular 25 m diameter combined wave and current test basin encircled by 168 active absorbing force feedback wavemakers the water depth in the test area is 2 0 m a re circulating flow system is created using 28 impeller units mounted in the plenum chamber beneath the floor robinson et al 2015 these enable a predominantly straight flow to be achieved in any direction across the central test area noble et al 2015 these unique design features remove any inherent limitation on both wave and current direction enabling the re creation of complex directional sea states in combination with current the modification of waves by a current is of particular relevance at the flowave facility where the waves are generated in a region of still water around the circumference of the tank and then interact with the current which is injected through the floor robinson et al 2015 in order to produce the desired wave height in the central test area of the tank with the presence of a current a correction factor must be applied to the wave generated in still water as discussed in section 3 4 3 3 2 site characterisation and sea state choice the european marine energy centre emec is an open water test facility for wave and tidal energy devices with both full scale and nursery sites based in orkney uk over the last 12 years emec has gained vast experience in both device installation and resource measurement at these sites directional wave data from the full scale grid connected wave test site at billia croo have been made available albeit without corresponding data on currents this emec dataset contains multiple years of half hourly directional sea states from january 2010 to january 2014 rather than choosing an individual spectrum for this case study outputs from draycott et al 2014 2015 have been used the aim of this previous work was to produce a small subset of statistically representative spectra from the same dataset whilst retaining the sea state complexity and directionality the use of clustering algorithms was of particular interest as they enable the consideration of the whole spectral form in the classification in draycott et al 2015 40 representative spectra were created from two years of data january 2010 to january 2012 around 35 000 sea states using a variety of methods a method was chosen which maximised intra group similarity and inter group distinctness utilising a combined binning clustering approach one of the resulting sea states was chosen as an example for reproduction representing approximately 0 14 of the dataset this was chosen as it represents an interesting case of a multi modal sea state with reasonable directional spreading the sea state has a significant wave height h m 0 of 3 53 m a peak period t p of 20 s and mean power p of 87 6 kw m wave crest the frequency and directional spectra along with the weighted directional spreading function dsf are shown in fig 3 the water depth at the wave buoy location is 52 m relating to intermediate water depth for the majority of wave components present with no tidal records available for the site the atlas of uk marine renewable energy abp mer 2012 has been used to obtain the peak tidal velocity at the billia croo site which is expected to be between 0 25 and 0 5 m s 0 5 1 0 knots 3 3 test plan wave current scenarios the wave current correction procedure was applied for wave conditions of increasing complexity tests were conducted with regular waves a long crested parametric jonswap spectrum and the non parametric directional sea state derived from the emec data to facilitate comparison the height and period of the parametric waves were chosen to roughly match the peak of the recorded sea state see table 1 test lengths were specified as a power of 2 s to facilitate frequency domain analysis with longer tests used to capture the detail of the directional spectra the three different sea states regular parametric and non parametric were tested at various relative angles to the current direction with three current velocities the chosen sea states must be scaled before re creation in the tank froude scaling was used to ensure the correct ratio between inertial and gravitational forces which are dominant in free surface waves when choosing a scale one must consider the ratio of tank to site depth along with the wave generation limits of the tank the flowave facility has a test water depth of 2 m and is optimised for wave generation at around 2 s period which corresponds to scales around 1 20 to 1 40 for wave climates typically of interest to renewable energy for waves in intermediate depth water spectra need to be scaled by the depth ratio between tank and site if this is not done although the energy distribution across frequency and direction will be correct the resulting wavenumber spectra will not this results in a frequency dependent wavelength discrepancy as there are no wave generation limits at the desired scale the depth ratio of 1 26 can be used without issue as well as scaling the wave spectra the tidal current must also be scaled using the same relationship at 1 26 froude scale the site estimates correspond to between 0 05 and 0 1 m s in the tank an additional velocity of 0 2 m s was also used to demonstrate the method effectiveness in faster currents where the wave current interaction is greater previous published work on wave current interactions has largely focussed on collinear cases waves either propagating in the same direction as the current or directly opposing it the capability of flowave permits the testing of non collinear cases with the waves at an arbitrary angle to the current direction waves were generated at relative angles to the current of 0 following π 4 π 2 perpendicular 3 π 4 and π opposing for the regular wave tests an additional four intermediate angles were also measured a range of angles were tested to demonstrate the applicability of the method however when considering a real site these would be chosen based on the wave fetch and tide directions 3 4 test method the sea states defined in table 1 were initially validated in the tank without the presence of a current confirming that they have been correctly generated prior to observing and analysing the transformation with current current velocities were set based on a depth averaged calibration from measurements taken in the centre of the tank it is noted that there is some spatial variation with reduced velocity towards the outside of the basin due to the method of producing current in the circular tank noble et al 2015 the potential implications of this are explored in section 5 2 velocity measurement using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv ensured that the current had reached an equilibrium prior to wave generation 3 4 1 directional sea state generation deterministic waves are generated at flowave providing a very high degree of repeatability ingram et al 2014 to generate a directional spectrum using this deterministic approach the single summation rather than double summation method is used depicted in fig 4 this avoids a phenomenon called phase locking miles and funke 1989 whereby waves with the same frequency but different directions interact and cause spatial patterns resulting in a non ergodic wave field to avoid this the initial frequency increments δ f can be split up further to create sub frequency increments δ f δ f n θ as shown in pascal 2012 these new frequency increments still within the original frequency bins now have a unique wave propagation direction associated with each of them the single summation approach used also aids in both the sea state measurement and the implementation of correction factors when analysing results in the frequency domain each measured component amplitude can be identified and operated on individually but only if the fast fourier transform fft bins match the generation frequencies this is key to the correction method and means that the appropriate correction factors can be identified and applied for each of the sub frequencies essentially this allows different correction factors to be applied for the various relative current angles which is vital for correcting directional seas with current the directional sea states presented here have a repeat time t of 2048 s defining the sub frequency increments δ f to be 1 2048 hz in order to achieved the desired frequency increments the scaled spectrum was interpolated to create 64 frequency bins between 0 and 1 hz and 32 directional bins from 0 π covering the region with significant energy content in the directional spectrum n f 64 n θ 32 re defining the directional spectrum for use in the single summation method gives the required frequency increments of 11 δ f δ f n θ 1 n f n θ 1 t 1 2048 h z 3 4 2 directional wave measurement surface elevations are measured at flowave using multiplexed two wire resistance type wave gauges providing point measurements at a sample frequency of 128 hz in order to calculate component wave directions and infer directional spectra these wave gauges are deployed in a carefully designed array draycott et al 2016 shown in fig 5 a the array has been chosen to encompass desirable spacings for the analysis and is based on optimising the co array uniformity over the angle and magnitude range of interest this co array is shown in fig 5b providing favourable separations for the calculation of directional spectra a phase time path difference ptpd approach fernandes et al 2000 esteva 1976 has been used to calculate component angles and directional spectra this method uses the measured phase differences and known separations between gauges to infer the wave direction at each frequency and provides a single wave angle per frequency through triangulation draycott et al 2016 has shown this method to be a highly effective approach for measuring directional spectra when combined with single summation wave generation for measuring directional wave characteristics in currents this approach has also found to be much more effective as discussed in section 5 3 and as such has been applied here in addition to reducing directional spectrum reconstruction error the ptpd outputs provide individual component wave angles opening up the possibility of effectively assessing wave refraction in current 3 4 3 correction procedure to produce waves of a specified height in combination with a current an amplitude based correction factor needs to be applied to the wavemaker input for a directional spectrum it is necessary to determine this factor for every frequency and direction component as a result of using a single summation method see section 3 4 1 the amplitude of each wave component with unique frequency and direction a i f i θ i can be corrected these correction factor are assumed linear taken as the inverse of the change in component amplitude as a result of the interaction with the current field discussed in section 2 2 and are calculated empirically the input wave spectrum is generated in the tank with current measured and the resulting component amplitudes compared with those desired eq 12 the correction based on observed discrepancy between the desired and measured directional spectra was multiplicatively applied to the input spectrum and the process repeated as necessary in an iterative manner until the measured spectrum was acceptably correct defined in this case as a mean spectral error ε 5 eq 13 12 c f e m p i r f i θ i a i d e s i r e d a i m e a s u r e d 13 ε i 1 n f s m e a s u r e d f i s d e s i r e d f i i 1 n f s d e s i r e d f i 4 results 4 1 regular waves the observed change in wave height as a function of relative angle and current velocity can be seen in fig 6 a as expected the observed transformation increases with larger current velocities and for a given current a larger relative angle corresponds to an increase in wave height this change has been compared to wave current interaction theories both linear smith 1997 and non linear second order baddour and song 1990 zaman and baddour 2011 the observed transformation is larger than predicted by either as can be seen in fig 7 this highlights that applying theoretical correction factors in this context is not particularly effective another interesting observation is the reduction in wave height with increasing current velocity when waves and current are perpendicular which is discussed further in section 5 1 from preliminary results of other regular wave cases noble 2017 this under prediction of wave transformation by theory appears to be consistent for all wave frequency steepness combinations tested the effect of wave steepness also appears to be fairly insignificant in terms of relative wave height change whilst frequency dominates both measured transformations and deviations from theory the error in wave height following empirical correction is shown in fig 6b with fig 6c showing the apparent angular change for all velocities and relative angles the resulting measured wave heights were within 0 7 of the desired the measured angular change is also relatively small yet displays no obvious pattern with respect to relative angle and current velocity the presence of a current reduces measurement accuracy through increased reflections gauge vibrations bending etc making it difficult to isolate small refraction effects from this increased error it is however evident that any refraction effects are very small at these velocities and so have not been corrected for any of the sea states this along with other practical considerations is discussed further in section 5 interestingly there is an apparent angular offset when there is no current present these calculated angles are a function of the measured phase differences and assumed gauge positions in addition to small physical position errors of individual gauges or the array reflections can significantly alter the measured phase differences and resulting apparent angles these reflections which exist with and without current present are likely the dominant cause of this apparent angular error 4 2 uni directional parametric spectrum the observed transformation of the parametric spectra is shown in fig 8 along with the deviation in energy density compared to the desired before and after correction clearly the same trend is seen as with the regular waves with larger transformations in the presence of larger currents and larger wave heights with increasing angle analysing this change in energy density it can be inferred that although the majority of the change is a result of wave current interaction there is also significant variation due to reflections particularly affecting the higher frequencies the magnitude of these variations are a function of the reduced absorption effectiveness in the presence of larger currents the reason for this spiky variation at higher frequencies is due to incident and reflected wave components at a given frequency being in or out of phase at the gauge array location regardless of the source of the frequency dependent variation the corrected deviation shows that the spectrum has been effectively corrected using a linear approach in a single iteration all wave current angle scenarios were corrected to give a final weighted error of less than 3 4 3 non parametric directional spectrum similar to the parametric outputs found in fig 8 the frequency spectrum transformation and correction for the non parametric emec derived sea state are shown in fig 9 again only a single iteration was required to achieve these results despite this sea state having significant directional spreading associated similar magnitude of transformation is observed to the parametric case along with analogous influence of reflections the corrected frequency spectra are also all within 3 of the desired demonstrating that the linear correction procedure applied to the sub frequency angular components is just as effective fig 10 shows the final corrected sea states output frequency spectra along with weighted dsf are shown for the three velocities and five relative angles the final directional spectrum output using the ptpd approach is shown for the base 0 1 m s case noting that the 0 05 m s and 0 2 m s results appear very similar the final sea states re iterate that the frequency spectra have been effectively corrected for all velocity angle combinations and in general so have the directional spectra and mean dsf directional errors are larger with increasing current velocity which is clear when assessing the weighted dsf errors with zero current the weighted dsf error was 6 95 whereas in 0 05 0 1 and 0 2 m s current the mean errors over all angles are 13 3 14 3 and 18 5 respectively although this is a significant increase it is felt that the majority of this is not refraction induced and instead is a product of increased measurement error combined with the way the error is calculated this is discussed further in section 5 3 5 discussion 5 1 observed change in wave height and spectra although the main aim of this work is to demonstrate the effective re creation of directional spectra with current one of the interesting outcomes is the observation of non collinear wave current interactions all results show larger wave transformation in the presence of higher current velocities and an increase in wave amplitude with increasing relative angle as would be expected the magnitude of the regular wave transformation however was much larger than expected as shown in fig 7 the change in wave height regular or significant with respect to the current condition was observed to be comparable for each of the sea states this is shown in fig 11 and is largely a result of all sea states having similar frequency and steepness values it may be expected that the directional sea state would have a smaller range in measured wave heights due to different wave components propagating at different relative angles however this proved not to be the case which is clear when assessing the observed wave height for the emec sea state in 0 2 m s current at a relative angle of π the cause of this is unknown but may be a consequence of reflections causing a net constructive effect over the wave gauge array area these reflections are dependent on frequency flow velocity and relative angle as expected from the similar wave height transformations the spectra also display a larger transformation than predicted by linear theory section 2 these discrepancies may be a result of tank specific wave generation issues in the presence of a current discussed further in section 5 2 so caution must be used before assuming that these results are representative of pure wave current interaction interestingly however the same effect has been observed by nwogu 1993 chakrabarti and johnson 1995 guedes soares et al 2000 although this does not resolve the cause of the difference it does suggest that at least in part these larger transformations may be a pure wave current interaction effect interestingly wave height was found to decrease in all cases where the mean wave angle was perpendicular to the current with a greater reduction at higher velocities with the current running water passes through the turning vanes and wave energy may be lost via the current return path under the floor this is analogous to having a finite crest length in open water with the perpendicular current causing wave crests to stretch out along their length thus reducing wave height the theories considered assume plane waves with infinitely long crests so predict no change in wave height with a perpendicular current 5 2 assessment of correction procedure the amplitude correction procedure applied has proven to be effective for all sea states providing frequency spectrum errors of less than 3 in all cases consequently the resulting wave heights were found to be very close to the desired for the regular uni directional parametric and non parametric emec sea states the mean wave height discrepancy over all velocity angle combinations were found to be 0 27 0 42 and 0 91 respectively maximum errors of 0 67 1 11 and 1 38 the correction factor although assumed linear includes a number of different factors of which the proportional influence remains unknown namely 1 superposition of wave and current fields 2 energy transfer between wave and current fields 3 increased reflections with larger currents which is relative to the array location 4 spatial variation of current in the tank and 5 paddle response to presence of current the favourable results show that although current effects on the wave field at flowave are inherently complex and non linear the variation in relative wave deformation as a result of a modest change in input wave amplitude can effectively be approximated as a linear process this is a useful output from this work although limits to the validity of this will need to be identified through additional testing with steeper waves and higher current velocities the wave current interaction theories do not include all of these factors which may account for the discrepancies in fig 7 the linear theory only accounts for the first while the non linear theory also partially accounts for the second factors 3 5 are facility specific and thus cannot be dealt with by general theories 5 3 measurement of wave directionality 5 3 1 measurement of component wave angles in current component angles are measured using the ptpd approach as implemented by draycott et al 2016 each gauge triad provides an estimate of wave angle for each of the frequency components based on the measured phase differences from an fft a circular kernel density estimate 250 bins is then applied to the 56 individual triad estimates in an aim to identify the true incident angle for each component this approach has been shown to provide very good estimates of incident wave angle without the presence of current typically identifying the correct angle within π 90 noting the directional bin widths are π 32 this usually provides good resulting spectral estimates in the presence of currents estimates of wave angle are not so accurate this is partly due to additional measurement uncertainty from a number of sources run up on gauges turbulence and vortex induced vibration viv the presence of the current also causes inconsistent bending to occur in the gauges meaning the assumed gauge positions are somewhat inaccurate and importantly wire separations can be variable additionally reflection levels are higher in the presence of currents which also alter the perceived phases particularly when the reflections are not opposing the incident components the cumulative effect of this is increased uncertainty in the angular estimates fig 12 shows the ptpd angle calculation outputs for the uni directional parametric spectrum noting that it is much easier to observe and analyse than the non parametric directional sea state it is clear that the overall sea state direction is generally identified well with directional bin size of π 32 a measured deviation of just π 64 from the desired angle would result in the energy being attributed to a different directional bin for that frequency component this happens relatively frequently in the presence of current as can be seen in fig 12 causing apparently large errors to arise through a measurement discrepancy of less than three degrees this results in the dsf and e f θ in fig 9 showing significant deviation even though the underlying errors themselves are quite minimal to get an error metric not related to bin size a net weighted angular error has been defined in eq 14 with the observed outputs for both the parametric and non parametric emec sea shown in fig 13 14 θ e r r o r θ o b s i θ 0 i a i a i as refraction levels are expected to be in the order of a few degrees isolating what is refraction and what is simply increased measurement error has proved difficult any significant refraction should however manifest itself as a negative weighted angular change in fig 13 for all non collinear cases as there is no clear indication that this is the case it is assumed that the refraction levels in these tests are low enough that they do not need to be corrected if this work was to be extended to tests with larger currents it may be that the refraction cannot be ignored requiring improvements to the measurement system this may take the form of stiffer wave gauges or an alternative measurement system to reduce vibration and deflection in the presence of current this would allow the implementation of an iterative procedure to correct for the observed refraction 5 3 2 relative performance of ptpd approach in the presence of a current the increased measurement errors mean that the ptpd outputs have some uncertainty associated although it has been inferred that the actual discrepancy is likely to be small this still means that the true directional spectrum generated remains unknown this uncertainty however is still significantly smaller than if typical directional spectrum reconstruction methods were used this is demonstrated in fig 14 where the dsf outputs for the base 0 1 m s cases are shown for the ptpd extended maximum likelihood method emlm and extended maximum entropy method emep approaches in fig 14 it appears that other than the emep reconstruction at 3 π 4 the emep and emlm approaches fail to effectively characterise the dsfs having a non zero magnitude for all angles this is clearly not the case and is likely due to the limitations of these curve fitting methods trying to fit to small reflections along with additional reconstruction errors as there is only significant energy within a range of π 4 and the array is in the tank centre meaning component reflections are opposing incident there should only be a very small dsf component 1 4 size of incident peak corresponding to 10 20 reflection opposing the incident rather than the observed constant energy content the poor performance of the emep and emlm approaches in these instances mean that the resulting reconstructions would clearly not be suitable to use as a basis for subsequent directional correction despite the ptpd approach reducing errors significantly identification of refraction effects with these low velocities and wave gauges available is still error prone it is thought however that using this approach with stiffer gauges will prove effective at measuring dsfs accurately in current with the additional advantage that component angles have been calculated and can now inform a correction procedure 5 4 application and implications for physical testing the results of this work demonstrate that site specific directional spectra can be re created with current at flowave it also highlights the importance of including any currents present when aiming to re create site conditions and the value in obtaining measurements of current velocity when carrying out resource assessment or carrying out full scale testing when re creating site conditions for tank testing including measured or representative currents can help explore the envelope of expected responses this will in turn provide more insightful and realistic device and mooring loads including both those incurred through the presence of the current directly as well as those resulting from the influence of the current on the wave field if combined conditions are specified then the input spectrum will need to be corrected so that the desired spectrum is obtained at the device location thus appropriately representing the power available with the current included the correct wavenumber spectrum will also be obtained ensuring that wave amplitudes along with wavelength steepness and celerity match those at the site due to the significant effect current can have on the perceived power and assumed wavelengths it is clearly advantageous to measure current velocities when carrying out resource assessment this is also the case when carrying out full scale testing as it enables true context to be placed on the results for example if characterising a wec performance by h m 0 and t e a device sensitive to wavelength and steepness will respond very differently in the presence of current despite having comparable h m 0 t e values in addition to the available power being misinterpreted the level of sea state complexity generally increases as a concept advances through technology readiness levels trls ingram et al 2011 early stage testing is typically limited to regular waves of varying frequency and height before advancing to standard parametric spectra both long and short crested the ability to produce combined wave current sea states especially with non parametric spectra will usually apply more to devices at advanced trls where a particular deployment site has been identified as such this ability to produce site specific combined sea states has the potential to extend and complement established development paths 6 conclusions a site specific non parametric directional spectrum has been obtained from emec and re created at 1 26 scale at the flowave ocean energy research facility with current velocities of 0 05 0 1 and 0 2 m s representing 0 5 1 and 2 knots full scale the studies conducted on complex directional wave fields in combination with currents within the flowave ocean energy research facility resulted in the following main findings the transformation of waves by current has been shown to have a significant impact on both the true wave power and steepness and on that which may be assumed without knowledge of the current field if the current present at the site is not included in tank testing incorrect power and wavenumber spectra will be generated and test results will not be representative of real site conditions an empirical correction procedure has been used to correct this sea state along with equivalent regular waves and uni directional parametric spectrum in the presence of currents from multiple relative angles the linear correction procedure applied proved effective after a single iteration providing corrected frequency spectra all within 3 of the desired and wave heights normally within 1 refraction effects were found to be minimal at the velocities tested although angle estimates prove to be error prone in current the ptpd approach provides much improved outputs over either the emlm or emep methods in this process non collinear wave current interactions were observed for each of the wave cases the measured wave transformation was larger than expected from theory which may partially be facility specific effects resulting from

23587,as more and more liquid carriers with huge size are manufactured to support the transportation demand of natural resources risks such as local deformation or even damage of cargo containment systems resulting from sloshing phenomenon subsequently increase and it s necessary to take the elasticity of tank walls into account in the researches of sloshing phenomenon in present paper we numerically studied the interaction between liquid sloshing flow and elastic bulkheads of liquid carrier by fully lagrangian particle method mlparticle sjtu solver which is an in house solver developed based on the moving particle semi implicit mps method coupled with the finite element method fem the mlparticle sjtu solver is extended to numerical analysis of elastic structural response due to the impact loads of sloshing flows to validate the feasibility of the mps fem coupled solver in dealing with fluid structure interaction fsi problems a benchmark of dam breaking flow interacting with elastic lateral wall is studied firstly and results show good agreement with published data then the sloshing phenomenon in an elastic tank is numerically investigated by varying the young s modulus of tank walls interesting characteristics regarding evolutions of free surface variation of impact pressures dynamic responses of the structures in both time and frequency domains are presented keywords moving particle semi implicit mps method finite element method fem fluid structure interaction fsi sloshing roll motion mlparticle sjtu solver 1 introduction sloshing in partially filled tanks is a phenomenon that can be observed frequently during liquid bulk cargo carriers operating on rough sea the high non linear behavior of sloshing involving violent fluid motion and high impact pressure could potentially cause large deformation on the walls of tanks loss control of stability or maneuverability of the ship particularly when the excitation associated with the motion of ship is close to the natural sloshing frequency the phenomenon hence is of great importance in assessing structural strength for designers of liquid cargo carriers in the past several decades this well known phenomenon has been carefully studied and published in many literatures contributions are mainly focused on the evaluation of the extreme impact pressure the coupling mechanism between ship motions and internal sloshing flows zhao et al 2014 mitra et al 2012 techniques to minimize the sloshing liu and lin 2009 in rigid tanks with model scale actually the tank is usually elastic particularly for the engineering applications with full scale or the tests with large scale for instance the large size bulkheads of the membrane type tanks are typically elastic structures in liquefied natural gas lng carriers the deformations of tank walls and ceilings induced by the impact loads should not be negligible since they are strictly associated with the state of free surface the level and duration of impact pressure and finally affect the safety assessment of structure in view of this it s necessary to take the influence of the structural responses into account in the researches of sloshing phenomenon until now several numerical approaches including the simplified approaches and the fully coupled approaches have been developed for this fluid structure interaction problem two of the typically simplified approaches are so called the spatial simplified approach and the temporal simplified approach for the fsi analysis for the spatial simplified approach the 3 d simulations of sloshing in a rigid tank will be conducted firstly and an overview of the sloshing phenomenon such as the impact positions and preliminary values of pressure can be obtained then the 2 d slice which covers the impact location is selected for the fsi analysis with refined grids this approach has been successfully applied for the assessment of structural safety of cargo containment system ccs against sloshing impact loads by ito et al 2008 in the work of lee et al 2015 a similar treatment called global local analysis approach is proposed to evaluate the sloshing resistance performance of a huge size lng carrier s insulation system for the temporal simplified approaches the long duration sloshing impact pressure is usually idealized by mathematical equations for instance graczyk et al 2007 and wang and kim 2007 simplified the sloshing induced pressures by triangular or trapezoidal function and then the idealized loads were applied in the calculation of structural response of the mark iii containment system for lng kim 2015 decomposed the long duration sloshing impact signal into the slowly varied and the rapidly varied component by using the wavelet transform technique the structural dynamic response was calculated by fem software under the rapidly varied component of impact load signal approximated by convoluting the wavelet response function and wavelet transform coefficient though it is economical for this fsi problem reliability of the simplified approach is subject to be verified since accuracy of the fsi analysis is strictly linked to the selections of impact locations and the expressions of impact loads in comparison with the simplified approaches accurate pressure time history can be calculated and miscalculation of the impact location could also be avoided based on the fully coupled approaches hence the fully coupled approaches are supposed to be more realistic to the practical phenomenon and thus draw much more attentions of researchers for example idelsohn et al 2008 applied the particle finite element method pfem for the simulation of the interaction between an elastic structure and free surface flows in a sloshing tank fossa et al 2012 investigated the possible effects of a deformable structure on the sloshing phenomenon with the help of adina software which is based on the finite element method fem for both fluid and structural analysis liao and hu 2013 developed a coupling finite difference method fdm and the finite element method fem for simulating the interaction between liquid sloshing flow in a rolling tank and a thin elastic plate paik and carrica 2014 developed a coupling nonlinear finite element fem solver and urans des overset solver the fsi problems of rolling tanks partially filled with fluid interacting with an elastic bar clamped to bottom or top are numerically simulated jia et al 2015 employed the fully coupled approach based on the software ansys for solving floating lng tank sloshing problem in fluid domain for fluid pressure and velocity and in structure domain for dynamic stresses dynamic deformation and dynamic reaction forces until now it can be noticed that relatively more numerical researches are carried out by grid based methods however applications of these grid based methods are restricted by the challenges e g inefficient process of grids generation for complex shape of structure requirement of dynamic mesh technologies for moving boundary or large structural deformation simulation of free surface with large deformation or breaking etc in view of these points the lagrangian meshless methods which are a new generation computational methods for the analysis of fluid physics are in good performance for these challenges in nearly few years kinds of meshless methods are proposed for free surface flow one representative meshless particle method is the moving particle semi implicit mps method which is originally proposed by koshizuka and oka 1996 for incompressible flow by integrating with the fem the mps method exhibits good performance in fsi problem according to the numerical benchmark test of dam break flow interacting with flexible structure mitsume et al 2014 sun et al 2015 however the application of the mps fem coupled method for the interaction between violent sloshing flow and elastic tank is rarely reported in present paper we aim to develop a mps fem coupled method for the fsi problem of liquid sloshing in a partially filled elastic tank a fully lagrangian fsi solver is implemented by extending our in house mps solver mlparticle sjtu with fem method for structure analysis theories of mps and fem method together with the coupling strategy would be presented firstly then the performance of fluid model for violent sloshing flow is verified by the comparison between present numerical result and corresponding experimental data as a verification of the capability of the mps fem coupled solver for fsi problem the numerical benchmark of dam break flow impacting onto an elastic lateral wall is simulated and compared with previous published simulation results then the tentative application of present solver for the simulation of sloshing in the elastic tank is conducted influence of the structural elasticity on the impact pressures deformations of structure and evolutions of free surface of sloshing flow are qualitatively analyzed 2 numerical methods in present study the mps fem coupled method is proposed to address the fsi problems herein formulas of mps method for fluid domain analysis and fem for structural domain analysis are briefly introduced then the coupling strategy between fluid solver and structural solver together with the treatments of data transformation on the fluid structure interface is present 2 1 fluid solver based on mps method 2 1 1 governing equations governing equations for incompressible viscous fluid in lagrangian system are 1 v 0 2 d v d t 1 ρ p ν 2 v g where v

incompressibility the incompressible condition of mps method is represented by keeping the particle number density constant in each time step there are two stages first temporal velocity of particles is calculated based on viscous and gravitational forces and particles are moved according to the temporal velocity second pressure is implicitly calculated by solving a poisson equation and the velocity and position of particles are updated according to the obtained pressure the pressure poisson equation ppe in present mps solver is defined as 8 2 p n 1 i 1 γ ρ δ t v i γ ρ δ t 2 n i n 0 n 0 where γ is a blending parameter with a value between 0 and 1 the range of 0 01 γ 0 05 is better according to numerical experiments conducted by lee et al 2011 in this paper γ 0 01 is adopted for all simulations 2 1 5 free surface particle detection method for the mps method pressure of the fluid domain is closely affected by the accuracy of free surface detection in present solver we employ a free surface detection method by zhang et al 2014 and defined as 9 f i dim n 0 j i 1 r i r j r i r j w r i j where the vector function f represents the asymmetry of arrangements of neighbor particles particle satisfying 10 f i 0 9 f 0 is considered as free surface particle where f 0 is the initial value of f for surface particle 2 2 structure solver based on fem in present paper extension of the solver mlparticle sjtu is conducted based on the implicit fem method for the analysis of structural physics according to the fem theory the spatially discretized structural dynamic equation which governs the motion of structural elements can be expressed as 11 m y c y k y f t 12 c α 1 m α 2 k where m c k are the structural mass matrix the rayleigh damping matrix the stiffness matrix respectively vector f is the external force acting on structure and varies with computational time vector y represents the nodal displacement of structure coefficients α 1 and α 2 correspond to natural frequencies and damping ratios of structure to solve the structural dynamic equation another two groups of functions should be supplemented to form the equation system closely here taylor s expansions of velocity and displacement developed by newmark 1959 are employed 13 y t δ t y t 1 γ y t δ t γ y t δ t δ t 0 γ 1 14 y t δ t y t y t δ t 1 2 β 2 y t δ t 2 β y t δ t δ t 2 0 β 1 where β and

implemented in the fsi solver since it can take the advantages of code modularity and flexible to enhance the computational accuracy and efficiency for the development of a partitioned based fsi solver the appropriateness and preciseness of its fluid structure coupling system is one of the crucial issues hwang et al 2014 concepts of present coupling system is shown as fig 1 the main distinguishing feature of this strategy corresponds to the different sizes of time steps of fluid and structure analysis according to the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition the fluid time step size δt f is commonly set as a much small value correspondingly a much larger structural time step size δt s can be utilized in present strategy to improve the calculation efficiency since the newmark β method which is employed for structure analysis is an implicit approach here δt s is k multiples of δt f where k is an integer in each cycle of fsi simulation the fluid analysis is performed based on the mps solver from the time step t n 1 to t n k firstly mean pressures of particles on the fluid structure interface are calculated as 21 p n k 1 k i 1 k p n i where p n i is pressure of the fluid particle on wall boundary at the instant t n i δ t f for the structure analysis external force is calculated based on the average pressure p n 1 acting on the structure surface and the fem solver is applied at the time step t n k after structure analysis position and velocity of structure particles are updated and considered as new boundary conditions for the calculation of fluid physical variables at next time step remarkably position of particles should be updated within the time steps t n 1 and t n k 1 based on velocity of particles calculated at the time step t n to avoid the instability of fluid field produced by the large displacements of structure particles within δt s 2 4 data transformation on the fluid structure interface in present paper two dimension fsi problems are considered and the tank walls will be dispersed to beam elements for the analysis of structural physics as a result special treatments need to be implied for data transformation on the fluid structure interface including the application of external force onto the beam nodes and the deformation of structural particle model corresponding to the displacements of beam elements here a particle group scheme hwang et al 2016 is considered structural particles located within the same section are grouped for the force transformation concepts of the numerical considerations are shown as fig 2 herein the vector f gi l and f gi r represent the force acting on left and right boundary particle of the structural group i respectively as mentioned previously the pressure of boundary particle is calculated by mps method initially then force acting on the structural boundary particle within the structural group is calculated by the integration of average pressure acting on the interface after this the resultant of forces of particles within the same group are applied onto structural fem node as the external load for the structural physics analysis for the deformation of structural particle model particles within a group move as one body based on the nodal linear velocities ui and vi which represent the velocities of beam nodes then the final position of structure particles can be updated according to the rotation of group around the center of the section based on the angular velocity ωi concepts of the numerical considerations for the deformation of structural particle model are shown as fig 3 3 validation test of the mps fem coupled solver as mentioned previously the bulkheads of partially filled tank may experience nonlinear impact pressures while the liquid container operating on waves in our previously published works capability of the mps solver mlparticle sjtu for violent free surface flows tang and wan 2015 tang et al 2016a b zhang et al 2016 zhang and wan 2017 including the sloshing flow in a rigid tank zhang et al 2014 has been studied herein feasibility of present solver for fsi problems should be primarily validated before numerically investigating the deformations of tank walls due to the impact loads of sloshing flow in present section a numerical benchmark is carried out the violent dam breaking flow impacting onto an elastic wall which shares the features with sloshing flow acting onto elastic tank is simulated based on the mps fem coupled method the benchmark is proposed by sun et al 2015 and sketch of the test is shown as fig 4 an elastic wall is mounted at right of the tank and corresponding numerical parameters for both structure and fluid analysis are presented in table 1 fig 5 shows the deflection at the top end of the elastic wall versus calculation time due to the impact pressure of dam break water the wall begins to deform in the positive direction of x at t 0 24 s and comes to the maximum at t 0 65 s then the deflection rebounds back with large displacement until t 0 9705 s additionally approximatively harmonic vibration of the elastic wall can be observed after t 3 0 s and presents a frequency closed to the first order of natural angular frequency of the wall ω 10 5235 both trend and amplitude of the deflection curve calculated by present mps fem coupled method agree very well with results published by sun et al 2015 fig 6 shows the comparisons of pressure contours free surface profiles and deformation of beam at four typical time instants smooth pressure field can be obtained by present solver both profiles of free surface and deformation of beam are quite similar with the referred results so our coupled mps fem method is dependable for fsi problems with violent free surface 4 simulation of sloshing flow in elastic tank as is well known the sloshing phenomenon in a rigid tank has been a topic of intensive study for more than four decades some prominent works about this problem have been carried out for instance faltinsen and timokha 2009 introduced kinds of approaches for this nonlinear problem systematically involving the experimental researches the theoretical and numerical methods however precious few literatures focus on the interaction between the sloshing flow and elastic tank walls which is a non negligible factor in the practical application by taking the elasticity of tank wall into consideration various characteristics corresponding to the structural response may be exhibited in present paper we focus on the coupling effects resulting from the lateral impact loads in a liquid tank with low filling ratio evolutions of free surface variation of impact pressures dynamic properties of the structure will be investigated in both time and frequency domain 4 1 numerical conditions according to the experimental results by souto iglesias et al 2015 violent sloshing flow with impact loads could be observed in a liquid tank with low filling ratio to investigate the structural response corresponding to the impact loads the similar numerical conditions are conducted in present paper schematic sketch of the tank is shown in fig 7 length l and height h of the rectangular tank model are 0 9 m 0 508 m respectively the tank is partially filled with water with the depth h 0 093 m corresponding natural period t n of the tank is 1 9191 s calculated according to the following formula 22 t n 2 π π g l tanh π h l a pressure sensor point s1 is fixed on the lateral tank wall at the reference depth h while the displacement register point s2 is at the center of the wall the rectangular tank is forced to roll harmonically around the center of the bottom wall the roll motion of the tank is governed by 23 θ α θ 0 sin 2 π t t where θ 0 is the amplitude of the roll motion and selected as 4 t is the rotation period and set as 1 6312 s 0 85t n in the initial stage the roll motion is buffered by the coefficient α in eq 23 which is defined as 24 α 0 5 1 t a n h 2 π t t π t t 1 0 t t in present simulations the model is dispersed by particles with an initial spacing size l 0 of 0 002 m and the total number of particles is 25 567 for the fluid analysis time step size is set as 0 0002 s which satisfy the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition 25 δ t f c l 0 v max where the upper bound of courant number c is considered as 0 2 according to koshizuka and oka 1996 v max is the maximum velocity of particle detailed parameters for fluid and structural analysis are presented in table 2 to investigate the influence of inherent material properties of the elastic tank on the sloshing flow and structural response elasticity of both lateral tank walls with different stiffness by varying the young s modulus e is taken into account and corresponding cases are shown in table 3 for the structural analysis rayleigh s damping has been added to the structure with a factor of α 1 0 0128 for the mass proportional contribution to the damping and α 2 5 01e 7 for the stiffness proportional contribution in addition the sloshing in a rigid tank case a in table 3 is also simulated to show the difference in comparison with results regarding elastic tank and the stiffness of rigid tank is assumed for an infinitely large value 4 2 simulation results 4 2 1 free surface evolutions fig 8 shows the deformations of tank walls and evolutions of free surface corresponding to the effects of structural elasticity the sloshing behaviors are qualitative compared between case b f h i with the young s modulus varying based on the geometric proportion in the range e 10 80 gpa in present numerical work elasticity of both right and left lateral tank walls have been taken into account nevertheless only the sloshing behaviors at near right wall of the tank are discussed here since the similar characteristics of responses regarding the two lateral walls could be observed as responses of tank walls are predominantly caused by the liquid impact loads processes of the impact events are depicted by simulation snapshots from 11 08 s to 11 64 s with an interval time step 0 08 s generally the whole process of impact event consists of four states the overturning of wave crest impacting of wave onto the lateral wall jet and run up of the wave along the wall drop of the liquid obvious differences between the four cases can be observed during these states first the impact event of case b takes place at the instant t 11 16 s while it happens later for the cases with smaller young s modulus particularly for the case i with an impact instant t 11 24 s then for the case b and f up shooting jets can be observed and run along the lateral wall up to the ceiling of tank as shown in fig 8 b5 f5 correspondingly the maximum heights of jets which run along the distinctly deformed wall are much lower for the case h and i as shown in fig 8 h5 i5 it s mainly due to that more kinetic energy of fluid particles in horizontal direction is converted to elastic potential energy of tank wall compared with the cases with larger young s modulus during the state of liquid drop fluid particles of case h and i are intensely bounced off from the lateral wall compared with that of case b and f since more elastic potential energy of tank wall is converted back to the kinetic energy of fluid particles in horizontal direction 4 2 2 displacement responses of lateral wall fig 9 shows the time histories of displacements d of measuring point s2 which mounted on left wall of the elastic tank the displacements and time have been made dimensionless with the height of lateral tank wall h and excitation period t respectively it can be noticed that the tank wall oscillates with the similar characters except the amplitudes for all the cases distinguished by the young s modulus the large oscillation amplitudes resulting from the peak values of impact pressure will present with a large period approximating to the excitation period of sloshing besides the oscillations with small amplitudes and small period due to structural elastic restoring force are also observed fig 10 shows the trends of oscillation amplitudes versus young s modulus of the lateral wall the large oscillation amplitudes within the dimensionless time 2 10 are presented statistically for each case then the trend curve which represents the relationship between oscillation amplitude and structural stiffness are created by mean values of the statistical data it can be noticed that the lateral wall oscillates with a larger amplitude as the reduction of structural stiffness fig 11 shows the envelope of nodal displacements of the left tank wall since the similar characters of the envelopes presence in all the 8 cases only the envelope regarding to the case with the young s modulus of 10 gpa is provided here both the displacements and node positions y in y direction have been made dimensionless with the height of tank h as shown in this figure the 1st order mode shape of the lateral tank wall is prominent in the fsi event the left wall of the tank vibrates with the much larger amplitudes in the negative x direction while with the smaller amplitudes in the positive direction 4 2 3 impact pressures on the lateral wall as shown in fig 12 the pressure time histories corresponding to rigid tank and elastic tank with the young s modulus 10 80 gpa are measured at the point s1 during the first 10 cycles herein the pressure and time have been made dimensionless with the hydrostatic pressure at the reference water depth h and excitation period respectively for the pressure in a rigid tank as shown as fig 12 a the well known character of the impact events church roof shape is observed though the maximum pressure at each cycle calculated by mps is slightly greater than the experimental data the trend of numerical pressure variation is in agreement with the experimental result the difference between the two results is similar to numerical result from souto iglesias et al 2015 with an explanation that a single phase simulation was conducted while the presence of air can affect the peak values and smooth the pressure curve for the pressures of elastic tank as shown in fig 12 b i the maximum pressures are smaller than that in a rigid tank and patterns of impact pressures are different in comparison with the classic church roof shape details of the differences can be revealed by the closer view of the pressure time signals in fig 13 the shapes of the pressure time histories immediately after the peaks regarding the elastic tanks present much larger amplitude oscillations particularly for the tanks with smaller stiffness it can be explained that the violent transverse motions of fluid particles are incited by the vibrations of lateral tank walls as noticeable in fig 8 in fig 14 the dimensionless duration time δt and start instant t impact of impact events are plotted versus structural stiffness the duration time of impact event is illustrated in previous fig 13 and can be defined by the difference between the end t end and start instants in each impact cycle an interesting phenomenon can be noticed in fig 14 that the duration time of impact events increase as the decrease of structural stiffness besides the start instants of impact events in elastic tanks lag in comparison with that of rigid tank it can be observed from the evolutions of free surface in previous fig 8 4 2 4 discussion of frequency responses during the analysis of variations of pressure and structural response in frequency domain two essential frequencies should be kept in mind including the 1st order dry frequency of lateral tank wall f nd and the wetted frequency f nw in this study the dry frequency f nd and the wetted frequency f nw can be obtained by the software msc nastran according to the previous mentioned time histories of structural displacements in fig 9 the tank wall vibrates with large oscillation amplitudes during the impact event and with small amplitudes during the sloshing wave progressing to the other side of the tank in the study of lugni et al 2014 the behavior of the wall within one sloshing period can be characterized as the quasi static regime the hydroelastic regime and the free vibration regime as the notation regime 1 regime 2 and regime 3 demonstrated in the fig 15 during the quasi static stage the elastic wall deforms as the front of sloshing wave approaches and impacts onto it the duration of this stage can be recorded as δt and the inverse of this characteristic time scale f s is added in table 4 by transforming the signals of the structural displacement histories corresponding to the last two regimes using the fourier method two response frequencies f h and f f can be obtained here f h and f f represent the frequencies regarding the hydroelastic regime and the free vibration regime respectively for all the cases with different young s modulus the typical response frequencies are summarized in table 4 the error of the frequency of free vibration regime f f relative to the dry frequency f nd is represented by err err f f f nd f nd it can be noticed that the two frequencies are in good agreement by contrast the frequencies f h are much smaller than the dry frequency f nd for all the eight cases according to the experimental study of hydroelastic slamming response of an elastic tank by lugni et al 2014 the response frequency f h may be effected by the added mass of water acting on the tank wall to confirm the conjecture the wetted frequencies regarding varying water heights on the lateral wall are calculated based on the software msc nastran as shown in fig 16 for all the cases with different young s modulus the wetted natural frequencies f nw decrease as the rising of the water on the lateral wall the equivalent heights h w regarding the frequencies f h are in the range 0 2 0 3 m which are the dominant wetted heights on the tank wall during the impact events and can be observed from the fig 8 5 conclusions in this paper a fully lagrangian fsi solver is primarily implemented based on the mps fem coupled method feasibility of the present solver for fsi problems with free surface is validated by the benchmark test of dam break flow impacting onto an elastic tank wall and good agreements between the present numerical results and the published data are achieved then the interaction between the violent sloshing flow and a liquid tank with elastic lateral walls is simulated by varying the young s modulus the influences of the structural elasticity on the sloshing phenomenon are investigated according to the evolutions of free surfaces it can be observed that the impact events of the sloshing in a tank with small young s modulus happen later than those in a more rigid tank and the phenomenon of fluid particles bouncing off from the tank s lateral walls is obvious according to the pressure histories measured on the lateral walls fluctuations of the pressure signals which are induced by the vibrations of the elastic walls are observed besides the structural responses are also presented the response frequencies f f regarding the free vibration regime are in agreement with the dry natural frequencies f nd by contrast the wetted frequencies f h are much smaller than the dry frequency f nd for all the eight cases since the effects of the added mass of water acting on the tank wall in sum as a preliminary study the mps fem coupled is a good choice for the investigation of sloshing involving fluid structure interaction however there are still some key issues of this fsi problem to be solved for instance the cavity will be entrapped during the sloshing wave impacting onto the lateral wall and may effects the characterization of the hydrodynamic loads to obtain the more accurate impact pressures the presented fsi solver is planned to be improved with the two phase model acknowledgement this work is

23587,as more and more liquid carriers with huge size are manufactured to support the transportation demand of natural resources risks such as local deformation or even damage of cargo containment systems resulting from sloshing phenomenon subsequently increase and it s necessary to take the elasticity of tank walls into account in the researches of sloshing phenomenon in present paper we numerically studied the interaction between liquid sloshing flow and elastic bulkheads of liquid carrier by fully lagrangian particle method mlparticle sjtu solver which is an in house solver developed based on the moving particle semi implicit mps method coupled with the finite element method fem the mlparticle sjtu solver is extended to numerical analysis of elastic structural response due to the impact loads of sloshing flows to validate the feasibility of the mps fem coupled solver in dealing with fluid structure interaction fsi problems a benchmark of dam breaking flow interacting with elastic lateral wall is studied firstly and results show good agreement with published data then the sloshing phenomenon in an elastic tank is numerically investigated by varying the young s modulus of tank walls interesting characteristics regarding evolutions of free surface variation of impact pressures dynamic responses of the structures in both time and frequency domains are presented keywords moving particle semi implicit mps method finite element method fem fluid structure interaction fsi sloshing roll motion mlparticle sjtu solver 1 introduction sloshing in partially filled tanks is a phenomenon that can be observed frequently during liquid bulk cargo carriers operating on rough sea the high non linear behavior of sloshing involving violent fluid motion and high impact pressure could potentially cause large deformation on the walls of tanks loss control of stability or maneuverability of the ship particularly when the excitation associated with the motion of ship is close to the natural sloshing frequency the phenomenon hence is of great importance in assessing structural strength for designers of liquid cargo carriers in the past several decades this well known phenomenon has been carefully studied and published in many literatures contributions are mainly focused on the evaluation of the extreme impact pressure the coupling mechanism between ship motions and internal sloshing flows zhao et al 2014 mitra et al 2012 techniques to minimize the sloshing liu and lin 2009 in rigid tanks with model scale actually the tank is usually elastic particularly for the engineering applications with full scale or the tests with large scale for instance the large size bulkheads of the membrane type tanks are typically elastic structures in liquefied natural gas lng carriers the deformations of tank walls and ceilings induced by the impact loads should not be negligible since they are strictly associated with the state of free surface the level and duration of impact pressure and finally affect the safety assessment of structure in view of this it s necessary to take the influence of the structural responses into account in the researches of sloshing phenomenon until now several numerical approaches including the simplified approaches and the fully coupled approaches have been developed for this fluid structure interaction problem two of the typically simplified approaches are so called the spatial simplified approach and the temporal simplified approach for the fsi analysis for the spatial simplified approach the 3 d simulations of sloshing in a rigid tank will be conducted firstly and an overview of the sloshing phenomenon such as the impact positions and preliminary values of pressure can be obtained then the 2 d slice which covers the impact location is selected for the fsi analysis with refined grids this approach has been successfully applied for the assessment of structural safety of cargo containment system ccs against sloshing impact loads by ito et al 2008 in the work of lee et al 2015 a similar treatment called global local analysis approach is proposed to evaluate the sloshing resistance performance of a huge size lng carrier s insulation system for the temporal simplified approaches the long duration sloshing impact pressure is usually idealized by mathematical equations for instance graczyk et al 2007 and wang and kim 2007 simplified the sloshing induced pressures by triangular or trapezoidal function and then the idealized loads were applied in the calculation of structural response of the mark iii containment system for lng kim 2015 decomposed the long duration sloshing impact signal into the slowly varied and the rapidly varied component by using the wavelet transform technique the structural dynamic response was calculated by fem software under the rapidly varied component of impact load signal approximated by convoluting the wavelet response function and wavelet transform coefficient though it is economical for this fsi problem reliability of the simplified approach is subject to be verified since accuracy of the fsi analysis is strictly linked to the selections of impact locations and the expressions of impact loads in comparison with the simplified approaches accurate pressure time history can be calculated and miscalculation of the impact location could also be avoided based on the fully coupled approaches hence the fully coupled approaches are supposed to be more realistic to the practical phenomenon and thus draw much more attentions of researchers for example idelsohn et al 2008 applied the particle finite element method pfem for the simulation of the interaction between an elastic structure and free surface flows in a sloshing tank fossa et al 2012 investigated the possible effects of a deformable structure on the sloshing phenomenon with the help of adina software which is based on the finite element method fem for both fluid and structural analysis liao and hu 2013 developed a coupling finite difference method fdm and the finite element method fem for simulating the interaction between liquid sloshing flow in a rolling tank and a thin elastic plate paik and carrica 2014 developed a coupling nonlinear finite element fem solver and urans des overset solver the fsi problems of rolling tanks partially filled with fluid interacting with an elastic bar clamped to bottom or top are numerically simulated jia et al 2015 employed the fully coupled approach based on the software ansys for solving floating lng tank sloshing problem in fluid domain for fluid pressure and velocity and in structure domain for dynamic stresses dynamic deformation and dynamic reaction forces until now it can be noticed that relatively more numerical researches are carried out by grid based methods however applications of these grid based methods are restricted by the challenges e g inefficient process of grids generation for complex shape of structure requirement of dynamic mesh technologies for moving boundary or large structural deformation simulation of free surface with large deformation or breaking etc in view of these points the lagrangian meshless methods which are a new generation computational methods for the analysis of fluid physics are in good performance for these challenges in nearly few years kinds of meshless methods are proposed for free surface flow one representative meshless particle method is the moving particle semi implicit mps method which is originally proposed by koshizuka and oka 1996 for incompressible flow by integrating with the fem the mps method exhibits good performance in fsi problem according to the numerical benchmark test of dam break flow interacting with flexible structure mitsume et al 2014 sun et al 2015 however the application of the mps fem coupled method for the interaction between violent sloshing flow and elastic tank is rarely reported in present paper we aim to develop a mps fem coupled method for the fsi problem of liquid sloshing in a partially filled elastic tank a fully lagrangian fsi solver is implemented by extending our in house mps solver mlparticle sjtu with fem method for structure analysis theories of mps and fem method together with the coupling strategy would be presented firstly then the performance of fluid model for violent sloshing flow is verified by the comparison between present numerical result and corresponding experimental data as a verification of the capability of the mps fem coupled solver for fsi problem the numerical benchmark of dam break flow impacting onto an elastic lateral wall is simulated and compared with previous published simulation results then the tentative application of present solver for the simulation of sloshing in the elastic tank is conducted influence of the structural elasticity on the impact pressures deformations of structure and evolutions of free surface of sloshing flow are qualitatively analyzed 2 numerical methods in present study the mps fem coupled method is proposed to address the fsi problems herein formulas of mps method for fluid domain analysis and fem for structural domain analysis are briefly introduced then the coupling strategy between fluid solver and structural solver together with the treatments of data transformation on the fluid structure interface is present 2 1 fluid solver based on mps method 2 1 1 governing equations governing equations for incompressible viscous fluid in lagrangian system are 1 v 0 2 d v d t 1 ρ p ν 2 v g where v t ρ p ν and g represent the velocity vector time water density pressure kinematic viscosity and the gravity acceleration vector respectively 2 1 2 kernel function in particle method governing equations should be expressed by the particle interaction models based on the kernel function here the kernel function presented by zhang et al 2014 is employed 3 w r r e 0 85 r 0 15 r e 1 0 r r e 0 r

incompressibility the incompressible condition of mps method is represented by keeping the particle number density constant in each time step there are two stages first temporal velocity of particles is calculated based on viscous and gravitational forces and particles are moved according to the temporal velocity second pressure is implicitly calculated by solving a poisson equation and the velocity and position of particles are updated according to the obtained pressure the pressure poisson equation ppe in present mps solver is defined as 8 2 p n 1 i 1 γ ρ δ t v i γ ρ δ t 2 n i n 0 n 0 where γ is a blending parameter with a value between 0 and 1 the range of 0 01 γ 0 05 is better according to numerical experiments conducted by lee et al 2011 in this paper γ 0 01 is adopted for all simulations 2 1 5 free surface particle detection method for the mps method pressure of the fluid domain is closely affected by the accuracy of free surface detection in present solver we employ a free surface detection method by zhang et al 2014 and defined as 9 f i dim n 0 j i 1 r i r j r i r j w r i j where the vector function f represents the asymmetry of arrangements of neighbor particles particle satisfying 10 f i 0 9 f 0 is considered as free surface particle where f 0 is the initial value of f for surface particle 2 2 structure solver based on fem in present paper extension of the solver mlparticle sjtu is conducted based on the implicit fem method for the analysis of structural physics according to the fem theory the spatially discretized structural dynamic equation which governs the motion of structural elements can be expressed as 11 m y c y k y f t 12 c α 1 m α 2 k where m c k are the structural mass matrix the rayleigh damping matrix the stiffness matrix respectively vector f is the external force acting on structure and varies with computational time vector y represents the nodal displacement of structure coefficients α 1 and α 2 correspond to natural frequencies and damping ratios of structure to solve the structural dynamic equation another two groups of functions should be supplemented to form the equation system closely here taylor s expansions of velocity and displacement developed by newmark 1959 are employed 13 y t δ t y t 1 γ y t δ t γ y t δ t δ t 0 γ 1 14 y t δ t y t y t δ t 1 2 β 2 y t δ t 2 β y t δ t δ t 2 0 β 1 where β and γ are selected as β 0 25 γ 0 5 for all simulations in present paper from eq 11 14 the displacement of structure at t t δt can be solved by the following formula implicitly hsiao et al 1999 15 k y t δ

where k and f are so called effective stiffness matrix and effective force vector respectively finally the accelerations and velocities corresponding to the next time step are updated as follows 19 y

implemented in the fsi solver since it can take the advantages of code modularity and flexible to enhance the computational accuracy and efficiency for the development of a partitioned based fsi solver the appropriateness and preciseness of its fluid structure coupling system is one of the crucial issues hwang et al 2014 concepts of present coupling system is shown as fig 1 the main distinguishing feature of this strategy corresponds to the different sizes of time steps of fluid and structure analysis according to the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition the fluid time step size δt f is commonly set as a much small value correspondingly a much larger structural time step size δt s can be utilized in present strategy to improve the calculation efficiency since the newmark β method which is employed for structure analysis is an implicit approach here δt s is k multiples of δt f where k is an integer in each cycle of fsi simulation the fluid analysis is performed based on the mps solver from the time step t n 1 to t n k firstly mean pressures of particles on the fluid structure interface are calculated as 21 p n k 1 k i 1 k p n i where p n i is pressure of the fluid particle on wall boundary at the instant t n i δ t f for the structure analysis external force is calculated based on the average pressure p n 1 acting on the structure surface and the fem solver is applied at the time step t n k after structure analysis position and velocity of structure particles are updated and considered as new boundary conditions for the calculation of fluid physical variables at next time step remarkably position of particles should be updated within the time steps t n 1 and t n k 1 based on velocity of particles calculated at the time step t n to avoid the instability of fluid field produced by the large displacements of structure particles within δt s 2 4 data transformation on the fluid structure interface in present paper two dimension fsi problems are considered and the tank walls will be dispersed to beam elements for the analysis of structural physics as a result special treatments need to be implied for data transformation on the fluid structure interface including the application of external force onto the beam nodes and the deformation of structural particle model corresponding to the displacements of beam elements here a particle group scheme hwang et al 2016 is considered structural particles located within the same section are grouped for the force transformation concepts of the numerical considerations are shown as fig 2 herein the vector f gi l and f gi r represent the force acting on left and right boundary particle of the structural group i respectively as mentioned previously the pressure of boundary particle is calculated by mps method initially then force acting on the structural boundary particle within the structural group is calculated by the integration of average pressure acting on the interface after this the resultant of forces of particles within the same group are applied onto structural fem node as the external load for the structural physics analysis for the deformation of structural particle model particles within a group move as one body based on the nodal linear velocities ui and vi which represent the velocities of beam nodes then the final position of structure particles can be updated according to the rotation of group around the center of the section based on the angular velocity ωi concepts of the numerical considerations for the deformation of structural particle model are shown as fig 3 3 validation test of the mps fem coupled solver as mentioned previously the bulkheads of partially filled tank may experience nonlinear impact pressures while the liquid container operating on waves in our previously published works capability of the mps solver mlparticle sjtu for violent free surface flows tang and wan 2015 tang et al 2016a b zhang et al 2016 zhang and wan 2017 including the sloshing flow in a rigid tank zhang et al 2014 has been studied herein feasibility of present solver for fsi problems should be primarily validated before numerically investigating the deformations of tank walls due to the impact loads of sloshing flow in present section a numerical benchmark is carried out the violent dam breaking flow impacting onto an elastic wall which shares the features with sloshing flow acting onto elastic tank is simulated based on the mps fem coupled method the benchmark is proposed by sun et al 2015 and sketch of the test is shown as fig 4 an elastic wall is mounted at right of the tank and corresponding numerical parameters for both structure and fluid analysis are presented in table 1 fig 5 shows the deflection at the top end of the elastic wall versus calculation time due to the impact pressure of dam break water the wall begins to deform in the positive direction of x at t 0 24 s and comes to the maximum at t 0 65 s then the deflection rebounds back with large displacement until t 0 9705 s additionally approximatively harmonic vibration of the elastic wall can be observed after t 3 0 s and presents a frequency closed to the first order of natural angular frequency of the wall ω 10 5235 both trend and amplitude of the deflection curve calculated by present mps fem coupled method agree very well with results published by sun et al 2015 fig 6 shows the comparisons of pressure contours free surface profiles and deformation of beam at four typical time instants smooth pressure field can be obtained by present solver both profiles of free surface and deformation of beam are quite similar with the referred results so our coupled mps fem method is dependable for fsi problems with violent free surface 4 simulation of sloshing flow in elastic tank as is well known the sloshing phenomenon in a rigid tank has been a topic of intensive study for more than four decades some prominent works about this problem have been carried out for instance faltinsen and timokha 2009 introduced kinds of approaches for this nonlinear problem systematically involving the experimental researches the theoretical and numerical methods however precious few literatures focus on the interaction between the sloshing flow and elastic tank walls which is a non negligible factor in the practical application by taking the elasticity of tank wall into consideration various characteristics corresponding to the structural response may be exhibited in present paper we focus on the coupling effects resulting from the lateral impact loads in a liquid tank with low filling ratio evolutions of free surface variation of impact pressures dynamic properties of the structure will be investigated in both time and frequency domain 4 1 numerical conditions according to the experimental results by souto iglesias et al 2015 violent sloshing flow with impact loads could be observed in a liquid tank with low filling ratio to investigate the structural response corresponding to the impact loads the similar numerical conditions are conducted in present paper schematic sketch of the tank is shown in fig 7 length l and height h of the rectangular tank model are 0 9 m 0 508 m respectively the tank is partially filled with water with the depth h 0 093 m corresponding natural period t n of the tank is 1 9191 s calculated according to the following formula 22 t n 2 π π g l tanh π h l a pressure sensor point s1 is fixed on the lateral tank wall at the reference depth h while the displacement register point s2 is at the center of the wall the rectangular tank is forced to roll harmonically around the center of the bottom wall the roll motion of the tank is governed by 23 θ α θ 0 sin 2 π t t where θ 0 is the amplitude of the roll motion and selected as 4 t is the rotation period and set as 1 6312 s 0 85t n in the initial stage the roll motion is buffered by the coefficient α in eq 23 which is defined as 24 α 0 5 1 t a n h 2 π t t π t t 1 0 t t in present simulations the model is dispersed by particles with an initial spacing size l 0 of 0 002 m and the total number of particles is 25 567 for the fluid analysis time step size is set as 0 0002 s which satisfy the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition 25 δ t f c l 0 v max where the upper bound of courant number c is considered as 0 2 according to koshizuka and oka 1996 v max is the maximum velocity of particle detailed parameters for fluid and structural analysis are presented in table 2 to investigate the influence of inherent material properties of the elastic tank on the sloshing flow and structural response elasticity of both lateral tank walls with different stiffness by varying the young s modulus e is taken into account and corresponding cases are shown in table 3 for the structural analysis rayleigh s damping has been added to the structure with a factor of α 1 0 0128 for the mass proportional contribution to the damping and α 2 5 01e 7 for the stiffness proportional contribution in addition the sloshing in a rigid tank case a in table 3 is also simulated to show the difference in comparison with results regarding elastic tank and the stiffness of rigid tank is assumed for an infinitely large value 4 2 simulation results 4 2 1 free surface evolutions fig 8 shows the deformations of tank walls and evolutions of free surface corresponding to the effects of structural elasticity the sloshing behaviors are qualitative compared between case b f h i with the young s modulus varying based on the geometric proportion in the range e 10 80 gpa in present numerical work elasticity of both right and left lateral tank walls have been taken into account nevertheless only the sloshing behaviors at near right wall of the tank are discussed here since the similar characteristics of responses regarding the two lateral walls could be observed as responses of tank walls are predominantly caused by the liquid impact loads processes of the impact events are depicted by simulation snapshots from 11 08 s to 11 64 s with an interval time step 0 08 s generally the whole process of impact event consists of four states the overturning of wave crest impacting of wave onto the lateral wall jet and run up of the wave along the wall drop of the liquid obvious differences between the four cases can be observed during these states first the impact event of case b takes place at the instant t 11 16 s while it happens later for the cases with smaller young s modulus particularly for the case i with an impact instant t 11 24 s then for the case b and f up shooting jets can be observed and run along the lateral wall up to the ceiling of tank as shown in fig 8 b5 f5 correspondingly the maximum heights of jets which run along the distinctly deformed wall are much lower for the case h and i as shown in fig 8 h5 i5 it s mainly due to that more kinetic energy of fluid particles in horizontal direction is converted to elastic potential energy of tank wall compared with the cases with larger young s modulus during the state of liquid drop fluid particles of case h and i are intensely bounced off from the lateral wall compared with that of case b and f since more elastic potential energy of tank wall is converted back to the kinetic energy of fluid particles in horizontal direction 4 2 2 displacement responses of lateral wall fig 9 shows the time histories of displacements d of measuring point s2 which mounted on left wall of the elastic tank the displacements and time have been made dimensionless with the height of lateral tank wall h and excitation period t respectively it can be noticed that the tank wall oscillates with the similar characters except the amplitudes for all the cases distinguished by the young s modulus the large oscillation amplitudes resulting from the peak values of impact pressure will present with a large period approximating to the excitation period of sloshing besides the oscillations with small amplitudes and small period due to structural elastic restoring force are also observed fig 10 shows the trends of oscillation amplitudes versus young s modulus of the lateral wall the large oscillation amplitudes within the dimensionless time 2 10 are presented statistically for each case then the trend curve which represents the relationship between oscillation amplitude and structural stiffness are created by mean values of the statistical data it can be noticed that the lateral wall oscillates with a larger amplitude as the reduction of structural stiffness fig 11 shows the envelope of nodal displacements of the left tank wall since the similar characters of the envelopes presence in all the 8 cases only the envelope regarding to the case with the young s modulus of 10 gpa is provided here both the displacements and node positions y in y direction have been made dimensionless with the height of tank h as shown in this figure the 1st order mode shape of the lateral tank wall is prominent in the fsi event the left wall of the tank vibrates with the much larger amplitudes in the negative x direction while with the smaller amplitudes in the positive direction 4 2 3 impact pressures on the lateral wall as shown in fig 12 the pressure time histories corresponding to rigid tank and elastic tank with the young s modulus 10 80 gpa are measured at the point s1 during the first 10 cycles herein the pressure and time have been made dimensionless with the hydrostatic pressure at the reference water depth h and excitation period respectively for the pressure in a rigid tank as shown as fig 12 a the well known character of the impact events church roof shape is observed though the maximum pressure at each cycle calculated by mps is slightly greater than the experimental data the trend of numerical pressure variation is in agreement with the experimental result the difference between the two results is similar to numerical result from souto iglesias et al 2015 with an explanation that a single phase simulation was conducted while the presence of air can affect the peak values and smooth the pressure curve for the pressures of elastic tank as shown in fig 12 b i the maximum pressures are smaller than that in a rigid tank and patterns of impact pressures are different in comparison with the classic church roof shape details of the differences can be revealed by the closer view of the pressure time signals in fig 13 the shapes of the pressure time histories immediately after the peaks regarding the elastic tanks present much larger amplitude oscillations particularly for the tanks with smaller stiffness it can be explained that the violent transverse motions of fluid particles are incited by the vibrations of lateral tank walls as noticeable in fig 8 in fig 14 the dimensionless duration time δt and start instant t impact of impact events are plotted versus structural stiffness the duration time of impact event is illustrated in previous fig 13 and can be defined by the difference between the end t end and start instants in each impact cycle an interesting phenomenon can be noticed in fig 14 that the duration time of impact events increase as the decrease of structural stiffness besides the start instants of impact events in elastic tanks lag in comparison with that of rigid tank it can be observed from the evolutions of free surface in previous fig 8 4 2 4 discussion of frequency responses during the analysis of variations of pressure and structural response in frequency domain two essential frequencies should be kept in mind including the 1st order dry frequency of lateral tank wall f nd and the wetted frequency f nw in this study the dry frequency f nd and the wetted frequency f nw can be obtained by the software msc nastran according to the previous mentioned time histories of structural displacements in fig 9 the tank wall vibrates with large oscillation amplitudes during the impact event and with small amplitudes during the sloshing wave progressing to the other side of the tank in the study of lugni et al 2014 the behavior of the wall within one sloshing period can be characterized as the quasi static regime the hydroelastic regime and the free vibration regime as the notation regime 1 regime 2 and regime 3 demonstrated in the fig 15 during the quasi static stage the elastic wall deforms as the front of sloshing wave approaches and impacts onto it the duration of this stage can be recorded as δt and the inverse of this characteristic time scale f s is added in table 4 by transforming the signals of the structural displacement histories corresponding to the last two regimes using the fourier method two response frequencies f h and f f can be obtained here f h and f f represent the frequencies regarding the hydroelastic regime and the free vibration regime respectively for all the cases with different young s modulus the typical response frequencies are summarized in table 4 the error of the frequency of free vibration regime f f relative to the dry frequency f nd is represented by err err f f f nd f nd it can be noticed that the two frequencies are in good agreement by contrast the frequencies f h are much smaller than the dry frequency f nd for all the eight cases according to the experimental study of hydroelastic slamming response of an elastic tank by lugni et al 2014 the response frequency f h may be effected by the added mass of water acting on the tank wall to confirm the conjecture the wetted frequencies regarding varying water heights on the lateral wall are calculated based on the software msc nastran as shown in fig 16 for all the cases with different young s modulus the wetted natural frequencies f nw decrease as the rising of the water on the lateral wall the equivalent heights h w regarding the frequencies f h are in the range 0 2 0 3 m which are the dominant wetted heights on the tank wall during the impact events and can be observed from the fig 8 5 conclusions in this paper a fully lagrangian fsi solver is primarily implemented based on the mps fem coupled method feasibility of the present solver for fsi problems with free surface is validated by the benchmark test of dam break flow impacting onto an elastic tank wall and good agreements between the present numerical results and the published data are achieved then the interaction between the violent sloshing flow and a liquid tank with elastic lateral walls is simulated by varying the young s modulus the influences of the structural elasticity on the sloshing phenomenon are investigated according to the evolutions of free surfaces it can be observed that the impact events of the sloshing in a tank with small young s modulus happen later than those in a more rigid tank and the phenomenon of fluid particles bouncing off from the tank s lateral walls is obvious according to the pressure histories measured on the lateral walls fluctuations of the pressure signals which are induced by the vibrations of the elastic walls are observed besides the structural responses are also presented the response frequencies f f regarding the free vibration regime are in agreement with the dry natural frequencies f nd by contrast the wetted frequencies f h are much smaller than the dry frequency f nd for all the eight cases since the effects of the added mass of water acting on the tank wall in sum as a preliminary study the mps fem coupled is a good choice for the investigation of sloshing involving fluid structure interaction however there are still some key issues of this fsi problem to be solved for instance the cavity will be entrapped during the sloshing wave impacting onto the lateral wall and may effects the characterization of the hydrodynamic loads to obtain the more accurate impact pressures the presented fsi solver is planned to be improved with the two phase model acknowledgement this work is

23588,this paper describes numerical simulations of the vortex induced vibrations vivs of a long flexible riser in a step current we consider the model vertical riser tested at the delta flume the simulation is carried out by our in house computational fluid dynamics cfd solver viv foam sjtu which was coupled with the strip method and developed in openfoam platform the vibration modes in both in line il and cross flow cf directions are accurately predicted the numerically predicted maximum mean il displacement and its location differed marginally from the experimental results the good agreement between the numerical and experimental results proved that this solver was reliable for predicting the viv response a large number of numerical tests were then carried out to study the effects of various parameters on viv responses further three main parameters are considered in this study current velocity top tension and mass ratio the intrinsic relationship between the natural frequency and oscillating frequency was analyzed to explain the occurrence of the dominant mode based on the numerical results the regular characteristics of the viv response with the reduced velocity

it affects pipelines spar platforms and risers the greatest concern of those is in the field of deep water oil extraction recently offshore oil platforms have been installed in water depths of over 2000 m as a result there is a great need to develop a reliable numerical solver for the prediction of viv response of risers with very high aspect ratios over the past few decades viv responses of long flexible risers have been extensively studied model testing has given valuable insights into the phenomenon of vivs chaplin et al 2005a 2005b huera huarte 2006 huera huarte et al 2006 huera huarte and bearman 2009a 2009b these model tests have shown that the response included significant contributions from several modes except at the lowest reduced velocities a temporary mode transition could also occur occasionally apart from the experimental studies numerical investigations have also attracted the attention of researchers empirical models and cfd models are the two main numerical methods used to predict the vibrations of risers willden and graham 2001 2004 2006 srinil 2010 duan and wan 2016a duan et al 2016 willden and graham 2004 investigated the transverse vivs of a flexible riser with an aspect ratio of the order of 1000 it has been observed that the mode of vibration with frequency closest to the local natural vortex shedding frequency is most likely to be excited wang and xiao 2016 presented a numerical study on vivs of a vertical riser subject to uniform and linearly sheared currents the il and cf vibrations were predicted accurately zhang et al 2017 presented a systematic study of the flow around a spring mounted wavy cylinder mainly at a moderate reynolds number of 5000 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 investigated vivs of two identical 2d elastically mounted cylinders in tandem in the proximity wake interference regime at re 200 for systems having one and two degrees of freedom zhao and wan 2016a 2016b studied flow past a cylinder and two cylinders by the approaches of sst des and sst ddes chaplin et al 2005a compared laboratory measurements of the viv responses of a riser with the blind predictions obtained via 11 different numerical methods including six cfd models and five empirical models it was found that the empirical models were more successful at predicting cf displacements than cfd models however the mode transition of the response with respect to time could not be embodied in those empirical models mode transition is a key feature of viv responses of long flexible risers however the il responses obtained by the given six cfd models were not in agreement with the experimental results thus there is need for improvement in the accuracy of the cfd model the dynamic features of long slender cylinders are determined by many structural parameters the vibration amplitudes and modes of riser viv responses are also influenced by the flow field using experimental numerical and empirical models many researchers have addressed this very important topic chaplin et al 2005b presented an experimental study of a vertical model riser with a different top tension which was exposed to a stepped current in the experiment of huera huarte and bearman 2009a three different top tensions were investigated for the smallest top tension the initial lower and upper branches were observed in the dynamic response of the model whereas for the other top tension cases the lower branch of the dynamic response vanished chen et al 2012 investigated the dynamic characteristics and vivs of the deep water riser with axially varying structural properties huang et al 2011 investigated cases that covered a wide range of riser viv problems for risers having different outer diameters lengths tensioning conditions and current profiles for risers having such high aspect ratios and complex flow fields around them a complete three dimensional simulation is not feasible the strip theory is an efficient strategy for solving viv problems of flexible cylinders with extremely high aspect ratios based on the strip theory we developed the solver viv foam sjtu by using the open source code package openfoam the entire fluid structure solution procedure was carried out in the time domain via a loose coupling strategy we applied the mesh movement based on interpolation using the radial basis function rbf the solver has good versatility it allows simulations of vivs in both cf and il directions with various aspect ratios mass ratios top tensions and current profiles to validate the solver we carried out numerical simulations of the vivs for the benchmark case the numerical results were found to be in good agreement with the benchmark data given in huera huarte 2006 based on the study of the flow field the intrinsic relationship between the flow field and the vibration response of the riser was analyzed the main contribution of this paper is that it investigates the parametric effects on the viv based on the solver viv foam sjtu a series of test studies are conducted using different parameters the effects of top tension current velocity and mass ratio are investigated and the response modes and trends analyses under different conditions are presented the results show multi mode characteristics of vibrations of the riser the rest of the paper is organized as follows a brief introduction to the numerical methods is given in section 2 in this section the governing equations of flow field and structure field are introduced the detailed algorithm of the fluid structure interaction strategy is presented in addition the post processing method of displacement responses is presented for modal analyses in section 3 the computations are validated by comparison with the benchmark experiment of huera huarte 2006 section 4 provides a detailed study of the effects of different parameters on viv the parameter analysis of the current velocity the top tension and the mass ratio are investigated separately in section 5 the study of the viv responses with respect to the reduced velocity based on the previous results are presented we analyzed the changes in the standard deviations of the displacement and the curvature as the velocity is reduced finally in the last section conclusions are drawn based on the results presented 2 method 2 1 flow model the flow field is modelled by solving the unsteady incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations 1a u 0 1b ρ u t ρ u u g u μ e f f u u μ e f f p e f f where u is the flow velocity and u g is the grid velocity μ e f f ρ ν ν t the effective dynamic viscosity in which ν and ν t are mixture kinematic viscosity and eddy viscosity respectively ν t is obtained by the sst turbulence model for turbulence closure p e f f p 2 3 ρ k is the effective pressure in which k is the turbulence kinetic energy 2 2 structural dynamic model a finite element structural model based on the euler bernoulli beam theory is employed to calculate the dynamic response of the cylinder supposing that e i and m remain constant along the span we have 3a e i 4 z 4 x z t z t z x z t z m 2 x z t t 2 c x z t t f x z t 3b e i 4 z 4 y z t z t z y z t z m 2 y z t t 2 c y z t t f y z t the axial force of the pipe t z varies spatially but not temporally because of the effects of the weights to solve the structural dynamic equations in finite element methods fems eq 3a and eq 3b can be discretized as m x c x k x f x m y c y k y f y where x and y are the nodal displacement vectors and with dots denoting differentiation with respect to time m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness matrices respectively f x and f y are the hydrodynamic force vectors the governing equations are solved using the newmark beta method 2 3 fluid structure interaction the strip theory cfd model is used to simulate the fluid dynamics the fluid flow computed locally in multiple two dimensional computational planes is placed along the cylinder span the pimple merged piso simple algorithm in openfoam is adopted to compute the flow field which is appropriate for solving the transient incompressible problem the reliability of this locally two dimensional method has already been confirmed willden and graham 2004 the fluid force at the individual axial strips is mapped to the nodes of the structural model at the start of each time step subsequently the pipe s motion is computed based on the euler bernoulli beam theory and the motion is used for moving the boundaries in the fluid domain accordingly then the computation of a new flow field is followed in this way a time step is advanced this procedure is shown in fig 1 based on the above theory the solver viv foam sjtu was developed the entire flow structure solution procedure was carried out in the time domain by using a loose coupling strategy 2 4 mesh deformation based on the rbf method the viv foam sjtu solver applies the radial basis function rbf dynamic grid technique into solution of dynamic mesh of openfoam the rbf dynamic grid technique could facilitate large mesh deformation that limits the application of laplace mesh deformation the viv foam sjtu solver could predict the viv responses in both il and cf directions of flexible riser with aspect ratio of 1000 magnitude under high reynolds number it is always expected to find a mesh solution method that is not only efficient and capable of enduring large mesh deformation but also maintain the quality of the grid after deformation especially the grid in the boundary layer the solution that can meet the above three demands are achieved by the rbf grid technique if the inner and outer diameters are set appropriately the grid inside the boundary layer could keep relatively static and the mesh quality and the deformation ability of the mesh will also be secured the rbf dynamic grid technique based on the dynamic mesh module dynamicfvmesh of openfoam is developed the rbf interpolation which is first proposed by rendall and allen 2008 can be used to derive the displacement of the internal fluid nodes when the displacement of the structural nodes on the interface is given the rbf is a set of basis functions with euclidean distances defined as follows s r i 1 n γ i ϕ r where r is the euclidean distance and ϕ r is the general form of the rbf function which has various forms there are four commonly used functions c2 tps gauss and imqb the definitions of these functions are given in table 1 the parameter γ i is the interpolation weight coefficient for the interpolation point i and n is the number of the object surface nodes of the dynamic mesh 2 5 post processing following chaplin et al 2005b the il and cf deflections of the riser from the initial vertical straight line condition were denoted by x z t and y z t respectively the deflected shape of the riser can be usefully represented in spectral terms which means that each pipe s total displacement can be decomposed into modal contributions the displacements in il and cf directions can then be expressed in terms of time dependent modal weights u u 1 u 2 u m and v v 1 v 2 v m as 4a x z t m 1 m ϕ m z u m t 4b y z t m 1 m ϕ m z v m t where ϕ ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ m is the matrix of the mode shapes and m is the number of unconstrained structural degrees of freedom the matrix form of eq 4 is 5a x z t ϕ z u t 5b y z t ϕ z v t the required mode is only needed to solve the least squares method is needed to solve the equations in this way the required modal information is achieved and the rest mode is filtered out the numpy library of python is used to solve the equations spatial frequency analysis can also be performed over the curvatures let us take the second derivative of eq 4 and assume that ϕ m z k 2 m 2 ϕ m z is satisfied where k is some constant that is the mode shapes are exactly sinusoidal or something similar therefore we have 6a c x z t x z t m 1 m k 2 m 2 ϕ m z u m t 6b c y z t y z t m 1 m k 2 m 2 ϕ m z v m t where a prime sign denotes differentiation with respect to z c x x 1 x 3 2 x is considered suitable for this study because x is always far below 1 this is also suitable for c y thus the modal weights for the curvature k 2 m 2 u m and k 2 m 2 v m can be of high absolute value for a large mode number we know from lie and kaasen 2006 that the modal responses that are physically impossible to be included in the observed range of responses should be excluded from the analysis however if those undesirable mode shapes are discarded just after solving eq 5 some information useful to the remaining accepted mode shapes may also be discarded taking this into account lie and kaasen 2006 chose to solve the modal amplitudes in the least squares sense consequently the time histories of the modal displacements for each spacing was obtained at every time step as ϕ t z x z t ϕ t z ϕ z u t ϕ t z y z t ϕ t z ϕ z v t where only the desirable mode shapes are included in ϕ 3 validation of computations the validation of the solver viv foam sjtu follows huera huarte 2006 benchmark experiments the experimental setup is shown in fig 2 the model riser and experimental setting are the same as that of chaplin et al 2005a b with key parameters set out intable 2 a series of simulations of the model riser has been undertaken the riser was 28 mm in diameter 13 12 m in length and had a bending stiffness of 29 88 nm2 the lower 45 of the riser was exposed to a uniform current whereas the upper part remained in still water 3 1 natural frequency the natural frequency is obtained as follows 7 k λm ϕ 0 where k and m are the stiffness matrix and mass matrix respectively λ is a diagonal matrix consisting of λ i i ω i 2 where ω i is the natural frequency of the system the fem calculation of the natural frequencies related to the first ten modes of the riser are presented the fem natural frequencies and mode shapes are shown in table 3 and fig 3 here the top tension is taken as 1600 n the experimental natural frequencies are shown in table 4 the riser was excited after setting different top tensions to determine the experimental natural frequencies twelve sets of tests were carried out the top tensions were increased from 397 n to 1919 n and the closest one was 1676 n table 4 gives the first ten experimental natural frequencies at the top tension of 1676 n the mode shapes can be quite similar to pure sinusoids the mass ratios are of small values therefore tension variations along the riser span become insignificant these results lay the foundation for subsequent studies on multi mode vortex induced vibrations of the riser 3 2 numerical model and boundary conditions fig 4 shows the distribution of 20 strips placed at equal distances along the portion of the riser exposed to a uniform current no strip is placed on the upper part which is in still water the riser is discretized into 90 equal structural elements forty elements are placed on the lower part in the uniform flow for each element of this part a distributed load is applied the remaining 50 elements are placed on the upper part in the still water the computational mesh of each strip is shown in fig 5 the boundary conditions are given as follows the inlet velocity boundary conditions are set to be the same as the freestream velocity u u 0 v w 0 the outflow boundary condition is defined by u x v x w x 0 the symmetry boundary condition is applied to other sides of the domain to avoid the effect of the boundaries on the flow field u y w y 0 v 0 the no slip boundary condition is employed at the surface of the cylinder the velocity of the cylinder boundary must agree with the pipe motion calculated using the 3d fem structural analysis u u s o l i d 3 3 cross flow motion analysis the displacements have been decomposed into modal contributions to manifest the modal feature especially the multi mode feature fig 6 depicts the modal amplitudes from the 2nd to the 7th non dimensional cf displacement it also shows the power spectral densities of modal weights the dynamics in the cf direction are governed by the 4th mode response the 4th mode response appears to be the most energetic as seen from its modal power spectral density the cf modal analysis agrees well with the experimental data as shown in fig 7 there is evidence of simultaneous contributions from the modes on either side of the dominant 4th mode the power spectral densities of the left modes are very small therefore their modal contributions to the total mode shape can be neglected the modal amplitude of this study is not as stable as the experimental results its reynolds number is approximately 1 69 10 4 at this reynolds number the flow is fully turbulent the turbulence is irregular multi scale and non linear in huera huarte 2006 the modal amplitudes of different serial experiments were found to be quite stable it is possible that a device might have been installed to stabilize the vibration of the riser however the modulating responses in the cfd simulations that come from the numerical aspects also account for this stability next we proposed an analysis of the dominant mode the vibration frequency of riser was obtained by performing a fast fourier transform fft of the cf displacement modal amplitudes on the right of fig 6 is the power spectra of the cf displacement modal amplitudes the frequency corresponding to the dominant mode is equal to 4 556 hz this value is very close to the 4th natural frequency consequently the cf vibration is controlled by the 4th mode it is also worth noting that the dominant frequency width is considerably wider than that of the experimental data therefore one may expect more than one mode modulation during the vibration typical instantaneous deflected shapes of the riser and the relevant experimental results are shown in fig 8 a and fig 8 b where the cf displacements are plotted against the relative elevation z l continuous lines in fig 8 a plot the positions of the riser at intervals of 0 01 s through a time period 1 s of the cf oscillation the numerical results agree well with the experimental data see fig 8 b not only in the mode shape but also in the predicted amplitude the saddle points of the numerical deflected shapes are fixed and distributed at equal distances along the riser a typical feature of the results is demonstrated in fig 8 the displacements of the upper part of the riser in still water are not smaller than those exposed to the uniform flow below because the oscillation of the riser is excited at the lower half of the riser and the vibration wave propagates from the bottom to the top fig 9 a shows the spatio temporal plot of the non dimensional cf responses obtained by numerical simulation it shows that the dominant mode shape is controlled by the 4th mode which agrees well with the experimental data of huera huarte 2006 see fig 9 b the instantaneous color legend of the experiment is always the same because the experimental modal weight of each order is very stable for the numerical study although the vibration mode shape is the same the amplitude is time variant therefore the instantaneous color legend of the present study varies this is because the numerical modal weight cannot remain constant all the time because of the turbulence 3 4 in line motion analysis the cf vibration is around the initial position unlike the cf motion the riser first reaches its equilibrium position and then it vibrates around the position in the il direction fig 10 shows the il mean displacement plotted against the relative elevation z l the red line represents the experimental results and the blue line represents the results of this study as shown in fig 10 the maximum displacement is not in the middle of the line because the displacement of the upper part of the riser in still water is smaller than the displacement of the lower part exposed to the current the il equilibrium position agrees well with the experimental results the value and location of the maximum il displacement are listed in table 5 the present study precisely predicts the location of the maximum displacement with an error of only 1 1 the rest of the analysis for the il motion of the riser is performed as in the previous section the il modal amplitudes from the 5th to the 10th order are provided in fig 11 high consistency was achieved as compared with the experimental results of huera huarte 2006 as shown in fig 12 the il response predicted by the numerical method is entirely dominated by the 7th mode which is consistent with the experimental data it also presents the dominant 7th mode of the il vibration fig 11 shows few contributions from the modes on either side of the dominant 7th mode the modal weight of the 7th mode is very stable and steady and the modal weight of the 6th and 8th modes is much smaller than the 7th mode the il vibration is in the form of a standing wave an fft is applied to obtain the il displacement modal amplitude which is used to explain the mechanism of the dominant mode on the right of fig 11 is the power spectrum of each il modal amplitude the dominant 7th mode has the largest spectral densities it has a frequency of 9 032 hz this value is close to the 7th natural frequency the il vibration is excited by the drag imposed on the riser and the cf vibration is excited by the lift the frequency of the il oscillation is about twice that of the cf direction because the drag frequency is approximately twice that of the lift the change of natural frequency is non linear the natural frequency increases slowly along with the increase of the top tension therefore the 7th natural frequency is about twice that of the 4th order it is easy to identify the mode shape from the instantaneous spatio temporal plot of the non dimensional il response as shown in fig 13 the numerical results agree well with the experimental data as shown in fig 14 the single 7th mode is seen as the result of the nearly constant il modal amplitudes plotted in fig 11 3 5 flow field analysis the vortex induced vibration of a long flexible riser is excited by the flow field fig 16 shows the lift and drag coefficients at the 15th slice where the il displacement is the largest it is worth noting that the fluctuation range of the drag coefficient is larger than that of a fixed cylinder the time history of displacements corresponds to the time history of hydrodynamic coefficients fig 15 depicts the il and cf displacements of the 15th slice the lift coefficient is very small in the initial 2 5 s the corresponding cf displacement is also very small the drag coefficient increases rapidly from the start the drag coefficient begins to vibrate around this position to reach the equilibrium position after approximately 4 s the il displacement correspondingly increases from the start and vibrates around the equilibrium position after 4 s generally speaking the motion of the riser in the early stage is primarily in the il direction after reaching its il equilibrium position the vortex begins to shed alternatively from the riser the motion of the riser is mainly manifested by the cf vibration at the il equilibrium position the consistency between the hydrodynamic force and the displacement illustrates the fluid structure coupling effect fig 17 depicts the contours of the instantaneous vorticity magnitude along the riser from the il and cf views at this reynolds number a 2s pattern is observed 4 parametric investigations a series of parametric studies with varying parameters were further performed separately to investigate the effects of the top tension the current velocity and the mass ratio 4 1 parametric analysis of current velocity three current velocities were considered in this section u 0 2 m s 1 0 4 m s 1 and 0 6 m s 1 where 0 6 m s 1 indicates the benchmark case for section 3 the main results for the different current velocities are listed in table 6 it includes the maximum il mean displacement x max d the location of the maximum il mean displacement z l the maximum il rms displacement the maximum cf rms displacement the dominate il mode and the dominate cf mode when the velocity is low the vibration can be quite moderate in the numerical simulation the riser vibrated at the 2nd mode in the il direction whereas in the cf direction it vibrated at the 1st mode see figs 18 and 19 not only the dominant mode but also the maximum mean displacement was considerably reduced compared to the benchmark from 3 072 to 0 389 times the riser diameter when the current velocity was increased to u 0 4 m s 1 the riser pipe vibrated at the 5th mode in the il direction and 3rd mode in the cf direction as shown in figs 20 and 21 the maximum mean displacement was 0 910 times the riser diameter with increasing current velocity the maximum mean il displacement increased and the position of the maximum value became low this is reasonable because drag increases with increasing current velocity furthermore only the lower part of the pipe experienced current flow this asymmetry played a significant role as the increase of the velocity which resulted in a keep falling of the location of the maximum il displacement with larger current velocities higher modes tend to be excited this is because the natural frequency of the riser is not changed with the varying current velocity since the strouhal number maintains at approximately 0 2 in a large range of reynolds numbers the strouhal number is defined as s t f s d u the vortex shedding frequency increases as the flow velocity increases in other words the vortex shedding frequency is proportional to the current velocity the oscillatory frequency of nodes is equal to the vortex shedding frequency when lock in happens the natural frequency remains unchanged and the oscillatory frequency increases with increased flow velocity therefore the natural frequency order corresponding to the oscillatory frequency increases 4 2 parametric analysis of top tension three top tensions are considered 1600 n 1900 n and 2200 n the benchmark is t 1600 n the dominant mode of t 1600 n is the 4th mode in the cf direction as presented in section 3 the amplitude of the 4th mode is greater than the amplitude of 3rd mode all the time no jump between multi modes is present in the cf vibration therefore the mode shape is of a very stable 4th order when the top tension is increased to 1900 n the modal weight of the 3rd mode increases in the cf direction at some interval the weight of the 3rd mode becomes even larger than that of the 4th mode which can be easily seen from fig 22 the 3rd mode carries a bigger weight when t 1900 n than when t 1600 n therefore the mode shape sometimes exhibits the 3rd order most of the time the mode shape is the unsteady 4th order fig 23 is the spatio temporal plot of the cf response which shows the transition process between the 4th and 3rd modes when t 1900 n it indicates that the dominant mode number begins to decrease with increasing top tension the above view of mode transition is also supported by the instantaneous deflected il and cf shapes as shown in the fig 24 the envelope of the il vibration is very clear and there is a distinct mode shape whereas the instantaneous deflected cf shape is not clear and two mode shapes the 3rd mode and the 4th mode coexist in the envelop together when t 2200 n the il dominant mode is further reduced to the 6th mode while the cf vibration remains at the steady 3rd mode this conforms with the tendency described above fig 25 depicts the il and cf instantaneous deflected shapes of the riser the main results for different top tensions are listed in table 7 the viv response of the riser follows the rule that the maximum il mean value increases with the reduced top tension this is reasonable because a large tension means a stronger restriction which makes a large deformation impossible the positions of these maximum values barely varied with the top tension because the current profile is not changed and the asymmetric effect of riser arising from the non uniform flow field is the same as the top tension increases the dominant il mode decreased from the 7th order to the 6th order and the dominant cf mode decreased from the 4th order to the 3rd order the top tension does have an effect on the vibration of riser but its effect is less significant than the flow velocity modal analysis was conducted to clarify the mechanism the first seven natural frequencies of various top tensions are listed in table 8 it is evident that the top tension can alter the natural frequencies the natural frequencies increased as the top tension increased as stated in willden and graham 2004 the vibration depends upon the proximity of the natural frequency to the strouhal frequency or the oscillatory frequency when a lock in occurs if we match the natural frequencies in table 8 with the oscillatory frequencies we can easily find the most proximate natural frequency the corresponding mode number can be exactly obtained from in table 8 for instance when t 2200 n the dominant frequency of il vibration is 8 335 hz see table 8 which is very close to the 6th order natural frequency 8 778 hz therefore the il mode shape presents the 6th order the rule is also applicable to the cf direction the dominant frequency of cf vibration is 4 177 hz which is very close to the 3rd order natural frequency 4 342 hz therefore the cf mode shape presents the 3rd order in addition the dominant mode number in the il direction is usually twice the size of the mode number in the cf direction because the excitation frequency for the il vibration is approximately twice the strouhal frequency we concluded that the increasing top tension could suppress the vibration in two ways by restricting the mean il displacement and by reducing the vibration mode however increasing the top tension to suppress vibrations can never be a perfect solution excessive top tension makes the axial stress increase accordingly which can cause negative effect on the strength of riser a very large axial stress will undoubtedly reduce the life expectancy of the riser which is undesirable 4 3 parametric analysis of mass ratio six mass ratios were simulated m 2 0 2 5 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 where m 3 0 indicates the benchmark for section 3 the power spectral density of every node for m 2 0 is shown in fig 26 the 3rd mode and 6th mode were attained for the cf and il directions respectively the root mean squares of the modal weight histories y r m s m and x r m s m are shown in figs 27 and 28 respectively as a function of each mode s natural frequency normalized upon the strouhal frequency of the stationary pipe at the same reynolds number f s the cases in this section are more than that in the study of parametric analysis of flow velocity and top tension consequently the specific mode number for different mass ratio are not studied separately alternatively as is done in this section all the modal responses are put together to be studied in addition to macro law we reached a more extensive and deeper analysis due to the new comparison method the two figures show that all of the test cases respond multi modally in both directions with each simulated response characterized by a response envelope the envelope extends over several modes and is centered on a single dominant mode however we do not rule out the case where two adjacent modes are of similar weight changing m changes the pipe s natural frequencies and mode shapes that is the natural frequency of a specific mode becomes more closely spaced with increasing m this conclusion can be drawn directly from fig 27 all the cases from m 2 0 to m 6 0 are drawn to the 10th mode the natural frequency for m 2 0 is about twice the natural frequency for m 6 0 as shown by lie and kaasen 2006 when a lock in occurs vortices are shed at the actual oscillatory frequency rather than at the strouhal frequency whereas the oscillatory frequency may not be exactly equal to the expected natural resonant frequency willden and graham 2004 mentioned that the vortex shedding frequency was found to occur at the strouhal frequency or slightly below it however a general tendency can still be found from fig 27 when focusing on the dominant mode it can be clearly seen that the natural frequency of most of them are slightly below the strouhal frequency the dominant mode number tends to increase with the mass ratio as shown in table 9 when the mass ratio increased from 2 to 2 5 the peak value also increased whereas the dominant mode number remained unchanged the dominant mode changes from the mass ratio of 2 5 3 whereas the peak value decreases a mode transition happens between these two cases for the mass ratio of 2 5 the lock in is mainly confined to the 3rd mode and the 4th mode takes place for the mass ratio 3 for the mass ratios of 4 and 5 the peak value goes as high as the peak values for the mass ratio of 2 5 there occurs a sudden drop in the peak value again for the mass ratio of 5 a transition from the 4th mode to the 5th mode occurs again which confirms our prediction consequently we can conclude that the dominant mode number tends to increase with the mass ratio whereas the amplitude of the dominant mode mainly depends on the proximity of the natural frequency to the vortex shedding frequency a sudden drop of peak value may happen for mode transitions in fig 28 the drawn modes start from the 4th mode the dominant modes for il vibrations are more sensitive to the natural frequencies anyway the conclusions we draw from fig 27 can also apply to fig 28 generally speaking the dominant mode increases with the mass ratio furthermore the natural frequency of the dominant mode for il vibrations largely remains twice that in the cf direction a further comparison between figs 27 and 28 indicates that the width of the response envelope for il vibrations is larger than that of cf vibrations this can be reasonable because we expect more modes to be involved in the higher mode number vibrations 5 discussion a common concern in viv study is how the response changes with reduced velocity the numerical results obtained previously in section 4 are analyzed now to further study the trend of the mode amplitude and curvature with reduced velocity the discussion is based on the following data processing method overall indications of the magnitudes of il and cf responses are provided by the root mean square values over z of the standard deviations of x and y with respect to time this is defined by σ x r m s 1 l 0 l 1 t 0 t x z t x z 2 d t d z σ y r m s 1 l 0 l 1 t 0 t y z t y z 2 d t d z where x z t and y z t are the time averaged il displacement and cf displacement respectively the time averaged cf displacement y z t is expected to be zero the integration in time is carried out over an interval t in which the velocity is constant in general this is the last 30 s of the 60 s duration of each test the root mean square values of the standard deviations of the il and cf curvatures σ c x r m s and σ c y r m s can similarly be defined as σ c x r m s 1 l 0 l 1 t 0 t c x z t c x z 2 d t d z σ c y r m s 1 l 0 l 1 t 0 t c y z t c y z 2 d t d z the rms value of the standard deviation the maximum attainable value of displacement and the oscillatory frequency are plotted in figs 29 and 30 as functions of the reduced velocity v f 1 d here v is the flow velocity and d is the cylinder diameter the frequency f 1 is the riser s natural frequency in still water in the fundamental mode which is obtained from fem with the corresponding top tension in fig 29 the standard deviations of displacements appear to be quite widely scattered with most points in the range of 0 04 and 0 12 diameters for il motion and between 0 1 and 0 3 diameters for the cf direction however as will be seen below this is a consequence of systematic changes that take place as the reduced velocity passes through the lock in range for successive modes this result suggests that the modal content has a major effect on the overall amplitude of the riser s response which is therefore quite sensitive to small changes in the reduced velocity the il and cf curvatures are of similar magnitudes the fact that the curvatures increase approximately with v f 1 d 2 is consistent with the interpretation that the oscillations occur at an approximately constant amplitude and at a mode number that increases linearly with reduced velocity the time averaged displacement of the riser in the il direction followed the same form in all cases increasing the velocity of the current has the effect of increasing the drag thereby increasing the modal frequencies and the maximum mean il offset x max the modal frequencies such as f 1 are approximately proportional to the square root of the tension therefore it follows that if the drag coefficients are constant the maximum mean offset would be proportional to the square of the reduced velocity x max d c v f 1 d 2 with c independent of the initial still water tension the results of the maximum mean offsets for all tests plotted together in fig 30 are clustered around this relationship however the maximum mean offsets depart from this relationship slightly which suggests that there are significant changes in drag coefficients associated with mode switching 6 conclusions we made comprehensive calculations of the vortex induced vibrations of a 13 12 m long model vertical tension riser having a diameter of 28 mm and a mass ratio of 3 0 the tests were carried out in a step current consisting of a uniform flow over the bottom 45 of the riser whereas the remainder was in still water a good agreement between the numerical and experimental results showed that the self developed solver is reliable good quality results have been obtained for the frequencies and amplitudes of responses with the 4th and 7th modes in transverse and il directions respectively the numerically predicted mean il displacements have good consistency with the experimental result with an approximate error of only 1 in the following study we carried out a series of numerical simulations of vivs of a vertical tension riser the current velocity top tension and mass ratio were investigated in detail to understand their effects on the viv responses of long flexible risers the parameters were studied separately to obtain some laws pertaining to them for example it was found that the maximum il mean displacement decreases with the increase of top tension however the location is almost unchangeable in any case the trend of mode order reduction is obtained as the top tension increases the relationship between the natural frequency and oscillating frequency was intensely investigated to explain the reason for the occurrence of the dominant mode finally the previous results of all the cases were analyzed to study the viv responses for the reduced velocity our understanding of the vivs of long flexible risers has benefited considerably from the fact that a large number of tests were carried out in this study the amplitude of the response in each mode grew monotonically as the reduced velocity increased through its lock in range generally the overall response of the riser included significant contributions from two or more modes and each combination persisted over a range of reduced velocities however these ranges overlapped so that a given reduced velocity could give rise to more than one pattern of modal contributions these remarks apply equally to the il and cf motions and the steps in viv responses in both directions are clearly linked the standing wave or travelling wave responses were captured for different reduced velocities

it affects pipelines spar platforms and risers the greatest concern of those is in the field of deep water oil extraction recently offshore oil platforms have been installed in water depths of over 2000 m as a result there is a great need to develop a reliable numerical solver for the prediction of viv response of risers with very high aspect ratios over the past few decades viv responses of long flexible risers have been extensively studied model testing has given valuable insights into the phenomenon of vivs chaplin et al 2005a 2005b huera huarte 2006 huera huarte et al 2006 huera huarte and bearman 2009a 2009b these model tests have shown that the response included significant contributions from several modes except at the lowest reduced velocities a temporary mode transition could also occur occasionally apart from the experimental studies numerical investigations have also attracted the attention of researchers empirical models and cfd models are the two main numerical methods used to predict the vibrations of risers willden and graham 2001 2004 2006 srinil 2010 duan and wan 2016a duan et al 2016 willden and graham 2004 investigated the transverse vivs of a flexible riser with an aspect ratio of the order of 1000 it has been observed that the mode of vibration with frequency closest to the local natural vortex shedding frequency is most likely to be excited wang and xiao 2016 presented a numerical study on vivs of a vertical riser subject to uniform and linearly sheared currents the il and cf vibrations were predicted accurately zhang et al 2017 presented a systematic study of the flow around a spring mounted wavy cylinder mainly at a moderate reynolds number of 5000 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 investigated vivs of two identical 2d elastically mounted cylinders in tandem in the proximity wake interference regime at re 200 for systems having one and two degrees of freedom zhao and wan 2016a 2016b studied flow past a cylinder and two cylinders by the approaches of sst des and sst ddes chaplin et al 2005a compared laboratory measurements of the viv responses of a riser with the blind predictions obtained via 11 different numerical methods including six cfd models and five empirical models it was found that the empirical models were more successful at predicting cf displacements than cfd models however the mode transition of the response with respect to time could not be embodied in those empirical models mode transition is a key feature of viv responses of long flexible risers however the il responses obtained by the given six cfd models were not in agreement with the experimental results thus there is need for improvement in the accuracy of the cfd model the dynamic features of long slender cylinders are determined by many structural parameters the vibration amplitudes and modes of riser viv responses are also influenced by the flow field using experimental numerical and empirical models many researchers have addressed this very important topic chaplin et al 2005b presented an experimental study of a vertical model riser with a different top tension which was exposed to a stepped current in the experiment of huera huarte and bearman 2009a three different top tensions were investigated for the smallest top tension the initial lower and upper branches were observed in the dynamic response of the model whereas for the other top tension cases the lower branch of the dynamic response vanished chen et al 2012 investigated the dynamic characteristics and vivs of the deep water riser with axially varying structural properties huang et al 2011 investigated cases that covered a wide range of riser viv problems for risers having different outer diameters lengths tensioning conditions and current profiles for risers having such high aspect ratios and complex flow fields around them a complete three dimensional simulation is not feasible the strip theory is an efficient strategy for solving viv problems of flexible cylinders with extremely high aspect ratios based on the strip theory we developed the solver viv foam sjtu by using the open source code package openfoam the entire fluid structure solution procedure was carried out in the time domain via a loose coupling strategy we applied the mesh movement based on interpolation using the radial basis function rbf the solver has good versatility it allows simulations of vivs in both cf and il directions with various aspect ratios mass ratios top tensions and current profiles to validate the solver we carried out numerical simulations of the vivs for the benchmark case the numerical results were found to be in good agreement with the benchmark data given in huera huarte 2006 based on the study of the flow field the intrinsic relationship between the flow field and the vibration response of the riser was analyzed the main contribution of this paper is that it investigates the parametric effects on the viv based on the solver viv foam sjtu a series of test studies are conducted using different parameters the effects of top tension current velocity and mass ratio are investigated and the response modes and trends analyses under different conditions are presented the results show multi mode characteristics of vibrations of the riser the rest of the paper is organized as follows a brief introduction to the numerical methods is given in section 2 in this section the governing equations of flow field and structure field are introduced the detailed algorithm of the fluid structure interaction strategy is presented in addition the post processing method of displacement responses is presented for modal analyses in section 3 the computations are validated by comparison with the benchmark experiment of huera huarte 2006 section 4 provides a detailed study of the effects of different parameters on viv the parameter analysis of the current velocity the top tension and the mass ratio are investigated separately in section 5 the study of the viv responses with respect to the reduced velocity based on the previous results are presented we analyzed the changes in the standard deviations of the displacement and the curvature as the velocity is reduced finally in the last section conclusions are drawn based on the results presented 2 method 2 1 flow model the flow field is modelled by solving the unsteady incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations 1a u 0 1b ρ u t ρ u u g u μ e f f u u μ e f f p e f f where u is the flow velocity and u g is the grid velocity μ e f f ρ ν ν t the effective dynamic viscosity in which ν and ν t are mixture kinematic viscosity and eddy viscosity respectively ν t is obtained by the sst turbulence model for turbulence closure p e f f p 2 3 ρ k is the effective pressure in which k is the turbulence kinetic energy 2 2 structural dynamic model a finite element structural model based on the euler bernoulli beam theory is employed to calculate the dynamic response of the cylinder supposing that e i and m remain constant along the span we have 3a e i 4 z 4 x z t z t z x z t z m 2 x z t t 2 c x z t t f x z t 3b e i 4 z 4 y z t z t z y z t z m 2 y z t t 2 c y z t t f y z t the axial force of the pipe t z varies spatially but not temporally because of the effects of the weights to solve the structural dynamic equations in finite element methods fems eq 3a and eq 3b can be discretized as m x c x k x f x m y c y k y f y where x and y are the nodal displacement vectors and with dots denoting differentiation with respect to time m c and k are the mass damping and stiffness matrices respectively f x and f y are the hydrodynamic force vectors the governing equations are solved using the newmark beta method 2 3 fluid structure interaction the strip theory cfd model is used to simulate the fluid dynamics the fluid flow computed locally in multiple two dimensional computational planes is placed along the cylinder span the pimple merged piso simple algorithm in openfoam is adopted to compute the flow field which is appropriate for solving the transient incompressible problem the reliability of this locally two dimensional method has already been confirmed willden and graham 2004 the fluid force at the individual axial strips is mapped to the nodes of the structural model at the start of each time step subsequently the pipe s motion is computed based on the euler bernoulli beam theory and the motion is used for moving the boundaries in the fluid domain accordingly then the computation of a new flow field is followed in this way a time step is advanced this procedure is shown in fig 1 based on the above theory the solver viv foam sjtu was developed the entire flow structure solution procedure was carried out in the time domain by using a loose coupling strategy 2 4 mesh deformation based on the rbf method the viv foam sjtu solver applies the radial basis function rbf dynamic grid technique into solution of dynamic mesh of openfoam the rbf dynamic grid technique could facilitate large mesh deformation that limits the application of laplace mesh deformation the viv foam sjtu solver could predict the viv responses in both il and cf directions of flexible riser with aspect ratio of 1000 magnitude under high reynolds number it is always expected to find a mesh solution method that is not only efficient and capable of enduring large mesh deformation but also maintain the quality of the grid after deformation especially the grid in the boundary layer the solution that can meet the above three demands are achieved by the rbf grid technique if the inner and outer diameters are set appropriately the grid inside the boundary layer could keep relatively static and the mesh quality and the deformation ability of the mesh will also be secured the rbf dynamic grid technique based on the dynamic mesh module dynamicfvmesh of openfoam is developed the rbf interpolation which is first proposed by rendall and allen 2008 can be used to derive the displacement of the internal fluid nodes when the displacement of the structural nodes on the interface is given the rbf is a set of basis functions with euclidean distances defined as follows s r i 1 n γ i ϕ r where r is the euclidean distance and ϕ r is the general form of the rbf function which has various forms there are four commonly used functions c2 tps gauss and imqb the definitions of these functions are given in table 1 the parameter γ i is the interpolation weight coefficient for the interpolation point i and n is the number of the object surface nodes of the dynamic mesh 2 5 post processing following chaplin et al 2005b the il and cf deflections of the riser from the initial vertical straight line condition were denoted by x z t and y z t respectively the deflected shape of the riser can be usefully represented in spectral terms which means that each pipe s total displacement can be decomposed into modal contributions the displacements in il and cf directions can then be expressed in terms of time dependent modal weights u u 1 u 2 u m and v v 1 v 2 v m as 4a x z t m 1 m ϕ m z u m t 4b y z t m 1 m ϕ m z v m t where ϕ ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ m is the matrix of the mode shapes and m is the number of unconstrained structural degrees of freedom the matrix form of eq 4 is 5a x z t ϕ z u t 5b y z t ϕ z v t the required mode is only needed to solve the least squares method is needed to solve the equations in this way the required modal information is achieved and the rest mode is filtered out the numpy library of python is used to solve the equations spatial frequency analysis can also be performed over the curvatures let us take the second derivative of eq 4 and assume that ϕ m z k 2 m 2 ϕ m z is satisfied where k is some constant that is the mode shapes are exactly sinusoidal or something similar therefore we have 6a c x z t x z t m 1 m k 2 m 2 ϕ m z u m t 6b c y z t y z t m 1 m k 2 m 2 ϕ m z v m t where a prime sign denotes differentiation with respect to z c x x 1 x 3 2 x is considered suitable for this study because x is always far below 1 this is also suitable for c y thus the modal weights for the curvature k 2 m 2 u m and k 2 m 2 v m can be of high absolute value for a large mode number we know from lie and kaasen 2006 that the modal responses that are physically impossible to be included in the observed range of responses should be excluded from the analysis however if those undesirable mode shapes are discarded just after solving eq 5 some information useful to the remaining accepted mode shapes may also be discarded taking this into account lie and kaasen 2006 chose to solve the modal amplitudes in the least squares sense consequently the time histories of the modal displacements for each spacing was obtained at every time step as ϕ t z x z t ϕ t z ϕ z u t ϕ t z y z t ϕ t z ϕ z v t where only the desirable mode shapes are included in ϕ 3 validation of computations the validation of the solver viv foam sjtu follows huera huarte 2006 benchmark experiments the experimental setup is shown in fig 2 the model riser and experimental setting are the same as that of chaplin et al 2005a b with key parameters set out intable 2 a series of simulations of the model riser has been undertaken the riser was 28 mm in diameter 13 12 m in length and had a bending stiffness of 29 88 nm2 the lower 45 of the riser was exposed to a uniform current whereas the upper part remained in still water 3 1 natural frequency the natural frequency is obtained as follows 7 k λm ϕ 0 where k and m are the stiffness matrix and mass matrix respectively λ is a diagonal matrix consisting of λ i i ω i 2 where ω i is the natural frequency of the system the fem calculation of the natural frequencies related to the first ten modes of the riser are presented the fem natural frequencies and mode shapes are shown in table 3 and fig 3 here the top tension is taken as 1600 n the experimental natural frequencies are shown in table 4 the riser was excited after setting different top tensions to determine the experimental natural frequencies twelve sets of tests were carried out the top tensions were increased from 397 n to 1919 n and the closest one was 1676 n table 4 gives the first ten experimental natural frequencies at the top tension of 1676 n the mode shapes can be quite similar to pure sinusoids the mass ratios are of small values therefore tension variations along the riser span become insignificant these results lay the foundation for subsequent studies on multi mode vortex induced vibrations of the riser 3 2 numerical model and boundary conditions fig 4 shows the distribution of 20 strips placed at equal distances along the portion of the riser exposed to a uniform current no strip is placed on the upper part which is in still water the riser is discretized into 90 equal structural elements forty elements are placed on the lower part in the uniform flow for each element of this part a distributed load is applied the remaining 50 elements are placed on the upper part in the still water the computational mesh of each strip is shown in fig 5 the boundary conditions are given as follows the inlet velocity boundary conditions are set to be the same as the freestream velocity u u 0 v w 0 the outflow boundary condition is defined by u x v x w x 0 the symmetry boundary condition is applied to other sides of the domain to avoid the effect of the boundaries on the flow field u y w y 0 v 0 the no slip boundary condition is employed at the surface of the cylinder the velocity of the cylinder boundary must agree with the pipe motion calculated using the 3d fem structural analysis u u s o l i d 3 3 cross flow motion analysis the displacements have been decomposed into modal contributions to manifest the modal feature especially the multi mode feature fig 6 depicts the modal amplitudes from the 2nd to the 7th non dimensional cf displacement it also shows the power spectral densities of modal weights the dynamics in the cf direction are governed by the 4th mode response the 4th mode response appears to be the most energetic as seen from its modal power spectral density the cf modal analysis agrees well with the experimental data as shown in fig 7 there is evidence of simultaneous contributions from the modes on either side of the dominant 4th mode the power spectral densities of the left modes are very small therefore their modal contributions to the total mode shape can be neglected the modal amplitude of this study is not as stable as the experimental results its reynolds number is approximately 1 69 10 4 at this reynolds number the flow is fully turbulent the turbulence is irregular multi scale and non linear in huera huarte 2006 the modal amplitudes of different serial experiments were found to be quite stable it is possible that a device might have been installed to stabilize the vibration of the riser however the modulating responses in the cfd simulations that come from the numerical aspects also account for this stability next we proposed an analysis of the dominant mode the vibration frequency of riser was obtained by performing a fast fourier transform fft of the cf displacement modal amplitudes on the right of fig 6 is the power spectra of the cf displacement modal amplitudes the frequency corresponding to the dominant mode is equal to 4 556 hz this value is very close to the 4th natural frequency consequently the cf vibration is controlled by the 4th mode it is also worth noting that the dominant frequency width is considerably wider than that of the experimental data therefore one may expect more than one mode modulation during the vibration typical instantaneous deflected shapes of the riser and the relevant experimental results are shown in fig 8 a and fig 8 b where the cf displacements are plotted against the relative elevation z l continuous lines in fig 8 a plot the positions of the riser at intervals of 0 01 s through a time period 1 s of the cf oscillation the numerical results agree well with the experimental data see fig 8 b not only in the mode shape but also in the predicted amplitude the saddle points of the numerical deflected shapes are fixed and distributed at equal distances along the riser a typical feature of the results is demonstrated in fig 8 the displacements of the upper part of the riser in still water are not smaller than those exposed to the uniform flow below because the oscillation of the riser is excited at the lower half of the riser and the vibration wave propagates from the bottom to the top fig 9 a shows the spatio temporal plot of the non dimensional cf responses obtained by numerical simulation it shows that the dominant mode shape is controlled by the 4th mode which agrees well with the experimental data of huera huarte 2006 see fig 9 b the instantaneous color legend of the experiment is always the same because the experimental modal weight of each order is very stable for the numerical study although the vibration mode shape is the same the amplitude is time variant therefore the instantaneous color legend of the present study varies this is because the numerical modal weight cannot remain constant all the time because of the turbulence 3 4 in line motion analysis the cf vibration is around the initial position unlike the cf motion the riser first reaches its equilibrium position and then it vibrates around the position in the il direction fig 10 shows the il mean displacement plotted against the relative elevation z l the red line represents the experimental results and the blue line represents the results of this study as shown in fig 10 the maximum displacement is not in the middle of the line because the displacement of the upper part of the riser in still water is smaller than the displacement of the lower part exposed to the current the il equilibrium position agrees well with the experimental results the value and location of the maximum il displacement are listed in table 5 the present study precisely predicts the location of the maximum displacement with an error of only 1 1 the rest of the analysis for the il motion of the riser is performed as in the previous section the il modal amplitudes from the 5th to the 10th order are provided in fig 11 high consistency was achieved as compared with the experimental results of huera huarte 2006 as shown in fig 12 the il response predicted by the numerical method is entirely dominated by the 7th mode which is consistent with the experimental data it also presents the dominant 7th mode of the il vibration fig 11 shows few contributions from the modes on either side of the dominant 7th mode the modal weight of the 7th mode is very stable and steady and the modal weight of the 6th and 8th modes is much smaller than the 7th mode the il vibration is in the form of a standing wave an fft is applied to obtain the il displacement modal amplitude which is used to explain the mechanism of the dominant mode on the right of fig 11 is the power spectrum of each il modal amplitude the dominant 7th mode has the largest spectral densities it has a frequency of 9 032 hz this value is close to the 7th natural frequency the il vibration is excited by the drag imposed on the riser and the cf vibration is excited by the lift the frequency of the il oscillation is about twice that of the cf direction because the drag frequency is approximately twice that of the lift the change of natural frequency is non linear the natural frequency increases slowly along with the increase of the top tension therefore the 7th natural frequency is about twice that of the 4th order it is easy to identify the mode shape from the instantaneous spatio temporal plot of the non dimensional il response as shown in fig 13 the numerical results agree well with the experimental data as shown in fig 14 the single 7th mode is seen as the result of the nearly constant il modal amplitudes plotted in fig 11 3 5 flow field analysis the vortex induced vibration of a long flexible riser is excited by the flow field fig 16 shows the lift and drag coefficients at the 15th slice where the il displacement is the largest it is worth noting that the fluctuation range of the drag coefficient is larger than that of a fixed cylinder the time history of displacements corresponds to the time history of hydrodynamic coefficients fig 15 depicts the il and cf displacements of the 15th slice the lift coefficient is very small in the initial 2 5 s the corresponding cf displacement is also very small the drag coefficient increases rapidly from the start the drag coefficient begins to vibrate around this position to reach the equilibrium position after approximately 4 s the il displacement correspondingly increases from the start and vibrates around the equilibrium position after 4 s generally speaking the motion of the riser in the early stage is primarily in the il direction after reaching its il equilibrium position the vortex begins to shed alternatively from the riser the motion of the riser is mainly manifested by the cf vibration at the il equilibrium position the consistency between the hydrodynamic force and the displacement illustrates the fluid structure coupling effect fig 17 depicts the contours of the instantaneous vorticity magnitude along the riser from the il and cf views at this reynolds number a 2s pattern is observed 4 parametric investigations a series of parametric studies with varying parameters were further performed separately to investigate the effects of the top tension the current velocity and the mass ratio 4 1 parametric analysis of current velocity three current velocities were considered in this section u 0 2 m s 1 0 4 m s 1 and 0 6 m s 1 where 0 6 m s 1 indicates the benchmark case for section 3 the main results for the different current velocities are listed in table 6 it includes the maximum il mean displacement x max d the location of the maximum il mean displacement z l the maximum il rms displacement the maximum cf rms displacement the dominate il mode and the dominate cf mode when the velocity is low the vibration can be quite moderate in the numerical simulation the riser vibrated at the 2nd mode in the il direction whereas in the cf direction it vibrated at the 1st mode see figs 18 and 19 not only the dominant mode but also the maximum mean displacement was considerably reduced compared to the benchmark from 3 072 to 0 389 times the riser diameter when the current velocity was increased to u 0 4 m s 1 the riser pipe vibrated at the 5th mode in the il direction and 3rd mode in the cf direction as shown in figs 20 and 21 the maximum mean displacement was 0 910 times the riser diameter with increasing current velocity the maximum mean il displacement increased and the position of the maximum value became low this is reasonable because drag increases with increasing current velocity furthermore only the lower part of the pipe experienced current flow this asymmetry played a significant role as the increase of the velocity which resulted in a keep falling of the location of the maximum il displacement with larger current velocities higher modes tend to be excited this is because the natural frequency of the riser is not changed with the varying current velocity since the strouhal number maintains at approximately 0 2 in a large range of reynolds numbers the strouhal number is defined as s t f s d u the vortex shedding frequency increases as the flow velocity increases in other words the vortex shedding frequency is proportional to the current velocity the oscillatory frequency of nodes is equal to the vortex shedding frequency when lock in happens the natural frequency remains unchanged and the oscillatory frequency increases with increased flow velocity therefore the natural frequency order corresponding to the oscillatory frequency increases 4 2 parametric analysis of top tension three top tensions are considered 1600 n 1900 n and 2200 n the benchmark is t 1600 n the dominant mode of t 1600 n is the 4th mode in the cf direction as presented in section 3 the amplitude of the 4th mode is greater than the amplitude of 3rd mode all the time no jump between multi modes is present in the cf vibration therefore the mode shape is of a very stable 4th order when the top tension is increased to 1900 n the modal weight of the 3rd mode increases in the cf direction at some interval the weight of the 3rd mode becomes even larger than that of the 4th mode which can be easily seen from fig 22 the 3rd mode carries a bigger weight when t 1900 n than when t 1600 n therefore the mode shape sometimes exhibits the 3rd order most of the time the mode shape is the unsteady 4th order fig 23 is the spatio temporal plot of the cf response which shows the transition process between the 4th and 3rd modes when t 1900 n it indicates that the dominant mode number begins to decrease with increasing top tension the above view of mode transition is also supported by the instantaneous deflected il and cf shapes as shown in the fig 24 the envelope of the il vibration is very clear and there is a distinct mode shape whereas the instantaneous deflected cf shape is not clear and two mode shapes the 3rd mode and the 4th mode coexist in the envelop together when t 2200 n the il dominant mode is further reduced to the 6th mode while the cf vibration remains at the steady 3rd mode this conforms with the tendency described above fig 25 depicts the il and cf instantaneous deflected shapes of the riser the main results for different top tensions are listed in table 7 the viv response of the riser follows the rule that the maximum il mean value increases with the reduced top tension this is reasonable because a large tension means a stronger restriction which makes a large deformation impossible the positions of these maximum values barely varied with the top tension because the current profile is not changed and the asymmetric effect of riser arising from the non uniform flow field is the same as the top tension increases the dominant il mode decreased from the 7th order to the 6th order and the dominant cf mode decreased from the 4th order to the 3rd order the top tension does have an effect on the vibration of riser but its effect is less significant than the flow velocity modal analysis was conducted to clarify the mechanism the first seven natural frequencies of various top tensions are listed in table 8 it is evident that the top tension can alter the natural frequencies the natural frequencies increased as the top tension increased as stated in willden and graham 2004 the vibration depends upon the proximity of the natural frequency to the strouhal frequency or the oscillatory frequency when a lock in occurs if we match the natural frequencies in table 8 with the oscillatory frequencies we can easily find the most proximate natural frequency the corresponding mode number can be exactly obtained from in table 8 for instance when t 2200 n the dominant frequency of il vibration is 8 335 hz see table 8 which is very close to the 6th order natural frequency 8 778 hz therefore the il mode shape presents the 6th order the rule is also applicable to the cf direction the dominant frequency of cf vibration is 4 177 hz which is very close to the 3rd order natural frequency 4 342 hz therefore the cf mode shape presents the 3rd order in addition the dominant mode number in the il direction is usually twice the size of the mode number in the cf direction because the excitation frequency for the il vibration is approximately twice the strouhal frequency we concluded that the increasing top tension could suppress the vibration in two ways by restricting the mean il displacement and by reducing the vibration mode however increasing the top tension to suppress vibrations can never be a perfect solution excessive top tension makes the axial stress increase accordingly which can cause negative effect on the strength of riser a very large axial stress will undoubtedly reduce the life expectancy of the riser which is undesirable 4 3 parametric analysis of mass ratio six mass ratios were simulated m 2 0 2 5 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 where m 3 0 indicates the benchmark for section 3 the power spectral density of every node for m 2 0 is shown in fig 26 the 3rd mode and 6th mode were attained for the cf and il directions respectively the root mean squares of the modal weight histories y r m s m and x r m s m are shown in figs 27 and 28 respectively as a function of each mode s natural frequency normalized upon the strouhal frequency of the stationary pipe at the same reynolds number f s the cases in this section are more than that in the study of parametric analysis of flow velocity and top tension consequently the specific mode number for different mass ratio are not studied separately alternatively as is done in this section all the modal responses are put together to be studied in addition to macro law we reached a more extensive and deeper analysis due to the new comparison method the two figures show that all of the test cases respond multi modally in both directions with each simulated response characterized by a response envelope the envelope extends over several modes and is centered on a single dominant mode however we do not rule out the case where two adjacent modes are of similar weight changing m changes the pipe s natural frequencies and mode shapes that is the natural frequency of a specific mode becomes more closely spaced with increasing m this conclusion can be drawn directly from fig 27 all the cases from m 2 0 to m 6 0 are drawn to the 10th mode the natural frequency for m 2 0 is about twice the natural frequency for m 6 0 as shown by lie and kaasen 2006 when a lock in occurs vortices are shed at the actual oscillatory frequency rather than at the strouhal frequency whereas the oscillatory frequency may not be exactly equal to the expected natural resonant frequency willden and graham 2004 mentioned that the vortex shedding frequency was found to occur at the strouhal frequency or slightly below it however a general tendency can still be found from fig 27 when focusing on the dominant mode it can be clearly seen that the natural frequency of most of them are slightly below the strouhal frequency the dominant mode number tends to increase with the mass ratio as shown in table 9 when the mass ratio increased from 2 to 2 5 the peak value also increased whereas the dominant mode number remained unchanged the dominant mode changes from the mass ratio of 2 5 3 whereas the peak value decreases a mode transition happens between these two cases for the mass ratio of 2 5 the lock in is mainly confined to the 3rd mode and the 4th mode takes place for the mass ratio 3 for the mass ratios of 4 and 5 the peak value goes as high as the peak values for the mass ratio of 2 5 there occurs a sudden drop in the peak value again for the mass ratio of 5 a transition from the 4th mode to the 5th mode occurs again which confirms our prediction consequently we can conclude that the dominant mode number tends to increase with the mass ratio whereas the amplitude of the dominant mode mainly depends on the proximity of the natural frequency to the vortex shedding frequency a sudden drop of peak value may happen for mode transitions in fig 28 the drawn modes start from the 4th mode the dominant modes for il vibrations are more sensitive to the natural frequencies anyway the conclusions we draw from fig 27 can also apply to fig 28 generally speaking the dominant mode increases with the mass ratio furthermore the natural frequency of the dominant mode for il vibrations largely remains twice that in the cf direction a further comparison between figs 27 and 28 indicates that the width of the response envelope for il vibrations is larger than that of cf vibrations this can be reasonable because we expect more modes to be involved in the higher mode number vibrations 5 discussion a common concern in viv study is how the response changes with reduced velocity the numerical results obtained previously in section 4 are analyzed now to further study the trend of the mode amplitude and curvature with reduced velocity the discussion is based on the following data processing method overall indications of the magnitudes of il and cf responses are provided by the root mean square values over z of the standard deviations of x and y with respect to time this is defined by σ x r m s 1 l 0 l 1 t 0 t x z t x z 2 d t d z σ y r m s 1 l 0 l 1 t 0 t y z t y z 2 d t d z where x z t and y z t are the time averaged il displacement and cf displacement respectively the time averaged cf displacement y z t is expected to be zero the integration in time is carried out over an interval t in which the velocity is constant in general this is the last 30 s of the 60 s duration of each test the root mean square values of the standard deviations of the il and cf curvatures σ c x r m s and σ c y r m s can similarly be defined as σ c x r m s 1 l 0 l 1 t 0 t c x z t c x z 2 d t d z σ c y r m s 1 l 0 l 1 t 0 t c y z t c y z 2 d t d z the rms value of the standard deviation the maximum attainable value of displacement and the oscillatory frequency are plotted in figs 29 and 30 as functions of the reduced velocity v f 1 d here v is the flow velocity and d is the cylinder diameter the frequency f 1 is the riser s natural frequency in still water in the fundamental mode which is obtained from fem with the corresponding top tension in fig 29 the standard deviations of displacements appear to be quite widely scattered with most points in the range of 0 04 and 0 12 diameters for il motion and between 0 1 and 0 3 diameters for the cf direction however as will be seen below this is a consequence of systematic changes that take place as the reduced velocity passes through the lock in range for successive modes this result suggests that the modal content has a major effect on the overall amplitude of the riser s response which is therefore quite sensitive to small changes in the reduced velocity the il and cf curvatures are of similar magnitudes the fact that the curvatures increase approximately with v f 1 d 2 is consistent with the interpretation that the oscillations occur at an approximately constant amplitude and at a mode number that increases linearly with reduced velocity the time averaged displacement of the riser in the il direction followed the same form in all cases increasing the velocity of the current has the effect of increasing the drag thereby increasing the modal frequencies and the maximum mean il offset x max the modal frequencies such as f 1 are approximately proportional to the square root of the tension therefore it follows that if the drag coefficients are constant the maximum mean offset would be proportional to the square of the reduced velocity x max d c v f 1 d 2 with c independent of the initial still water tension the results of the maximum mean offsets for all tests plotted together in fig 30 are clustered around this relationship however the maximum mean offsets depart from this relationship slightly which suggests that there are significant changes in drag coefficients associated with mode switching 6 conclusions we made comprehensive calculations of the vortex induced vibrations of a 13 12 m long model vertical tension riser having a diameter of 28 mm and a mass ratio of 3 0 the tests were carried out in a step current consisting of a uniform flow over the bottom 45 of the riser whereas the remainder was in still water a good agreement between the numerical and experimental results showed that the self developed solver is reliable good quality results have been obtained for the frequencies and amplitudes of responses with the 4th and 7th modes in transverse and il directions respectively the numerically predicted mean il displacements have good consistency with the experimental result with an approximate error of only 1 in the following study we carried out a series of numerical simulations of vivs of a vertical tension riser the current velocity top tension and mass ratio were investigated in detail to understand their effects on the viv responses of long flexible risers the parameters were studied separately to obtain some laws pertaining to them for example it was found that the maximum il mean displacement decreases with the increase of top tension however the location is almost unchangeable in any case the trend of mode order reduction is obtained as the top tension increases the relationship between the natural frequency and oscillating frequency was intensely investigated to explain the reason for the occurrence of the dominant mode finally the previous results of all the cases were analyzed to study the viv responses for the reduced velocity our understanding of the vivs of long flexible risers has benefited considerably from the fact that a large number of tests were carried out in this study the amplitude of the response in each mode grew monotonically as the reduced velocity increased through its lock in range generally the overall response of the riser included significant contributions from two or more modes and each combination persisted over a range of reduced velocities however these ranges overlapped so that a given reduced velocity could give rise to more than one pattern of modal contributions these remarks apply equally to the il and cf motions and the steps in viv responses in both directions are clearly linked the standing wave or travelling wave responses were captured for different reduced velocities

23589,it has been recognized that compared with coherent acoustic communication multiple frequency shift keying mfsk underwater acoustic communication offers the advantages of low complexity easy implementation and channel tolerance but it is subject to significant performance degradation caused by inter symbol interference isi when the multipath spread is larger than symbol duration the time reversal is capable of effectively suppressing the channel multipath by the means of temporal spatial focusing which has been widely examined and applied in coherent underwater acoustic communication systems however there is a lack of investigations to incorporate the time reversal with mfsk communication in this paper we report a multi channel time reversal mfsk receiver in which the channel estimate is initially obtained and periodically updated by matched filtering of the sync preamble meanwhile down conversion is adopted to reduce computational complexity the performance of the proposed receiver is evaluated in a shallow water channel with severe multipath spread in terms of bit error rate ber and robustness upon time variations keywords multipath isi down conversion time reversal mfsk 1 introduction in view of numerous studies in high bandwidth efficiency coherent acoustic communication technologies such as qpsk zhou et al 2017 ofdm gomes and barroso 2004 and mimo zhou et al 2014 mfsk acoustic communication is still drawing extensive attention from various practical fields due to its low implementation complexity as well as robustness in the presence of severe time frequency selective fading channels however an inherent drawback of the classical mfsk is that it cannot solve the multipath induced inter symbol interference isi when the multipath spread is larger than the symbol duration traditional solutions including adding protection interval or increasing symbol duration are adopted to ensure that the multipath component of the previous symbol does not overlap with the new following symbol both of which unfortunately lead to additional overhead moreover frequency selective fading caused by the multipath components that spanning inside the range of symbol width poses another difficulty to the mfsk systems as the non coherent demodulation totally relies on the comparison of energy associated with each modulated frequencies to obtain correct detection until now the most general method to circumvent the above problem is to adopt different error correction coding such as the non binary ldpc code in fan et al 2014 turbo code in yue et al 2012 and convolutional code in green and rice 2000 to correct the errors caused by isi and frequency selective fading edelmann et al 2002 mousavi et al 2016 stojanovic 2005 while retaining the advantages of mfsk to develop a channel tolerant acoustic communication approach m d green and j a rice green and rice 2000 proposed to incorporate frequency hopping fh with mfsk to overcome the problem caused by multipath however the date rate of the fh mfsk is low as the spread spectrum green and rice 2000 nature of fh means low efficiency of bandwidth utilization in yang and yang 2003 it was reported that different lengths of multipath delays have a significant effect on the bit error rate ber of fsk underwater communication multi channel beamforming as well as the spatial diversity combining is adopted to improve the ber performance moreover yang and yang 2006 found that mfsk ber performance using an incoherent receiver is determined by fading statistics of received signal amplitude which exhibits a non rayleigh behavior and may be modeled as a k distribution x j shu et al shu et al 2016 investigated the chaotic modulation mfsk cmfsk to improve the security for confidential applications however shu et al 2016 also pointed out that in terms of the ber performance under multipath distortion the cmfsk is equivalent to conventional digital modulations being recognized as a promising underwater acoustic uwa channel matching technology zhang and dong 2013 song et al 2008 passive time reversal is capable of overcoming the impairment of multipath by the means of temporal spatial focusing implementation of multi channel time reversal tr processing is generally equivalent to first obtain the multi channel probes that carried the information of uwa channels and then perform time reversal with the received signal of each channel output of which are finally summed up to enable temporal spatial compressing of multipath silva and jesus 2002 currently due to its easily coupling with channel equalizer jamshidi and moezzi 2015a isi cancellation algorithm jamshidi 2011 jamshidi and moezzi 2015b and channel estimator in coherent receiver structure there have been substantial investigations of time reversal in coherent underwater acoustic communication such as those applying the time reversal in ofdm liu and yang 2012 zhou et al 2015a b qpsk xi et al 2015 duan and zheng 2015 and mimo psk zhang et al 2016 it is quite interesting to point out that until now few literature has been reported to incorporate the time reversal with mfsk acoustic communication although both of which are recognized as low complexity and easy implementation in this letter we report our work to apply the time reversal method in the mfsk communication to address the difficulties caused by isi in the presence of severe multipath spread with down conversion a multi channel time reversal mfsk receiver is proposed which adopts the sync preamble as channel probe finally the performance of the proposed method is verified by the sea trial experiment performed in shallow sea channel with large multipath spread based on which the comparison are made to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of time reversal mfsk 2 brief introduction of time reversal and mfsk 2 1 multi channel time reversal zhou et al 2014 for multi channel time reversal system under the assumption that the impulse response of the ith channel h i t remains static within the period the signal received by the ith channel is 1 s i r t s t h i t n i t where s ir t is received signal s t is source signal n i t is local interference noise the symbol represents convolution operation thus the time reversal processing at the ith channel can be expressed as 2 r i t s i r t h i t s t h i t n i t h i t s t h i t h i t n i t h i t s t h i t h i t n i t h i t where h i t is time reverse of the channel response obtained by various estimation methods such as mmse or ls chitre et al 2008 for the multi channel time reversal time reversal output of each channel is summed up to explore spatial diversity of the multipath structure 3 s t i 1 n r i t s t i 1 n h i t h i t i 1 n n i t h i t s t n n t where q t i 1 n h i t h i t defined as q function song et al 2007 is the autocorrelations of the channel response summed over all channels which approaches to an ideal delta t impulse response with an increasing number of receivers song and badiey 2012 nn t is the total noise term therefore after the multi channel time reversal processing multipath is effectively temporally spatially focused to suppress the isi 2 2 the proposed tr mfsk receiver demodulation of mfsk is generally performed with fast fourier transforms ffts and then energy measurement of each fft bins namely using m 16 implies that each mfsk symbols contains 16 fft bins to reduce the computational complexity the ffts demodulation can also be performed after the front end processing of down conversion and down resampling yang 2005 the structure of the proposed multi channel time reversal mfsk receiver is shown in fig 1 as fig 1 indicates after the down conversion and down resampling the matched filtering output of the sync preamble is used as the measured channel response for time reversal processing time reversal output of each channel is summed up for the final mfsk demodulation to yield temporal spatial multipath suppression note that compared with contemporary coherent time reversal receiver the time reversal mfsk directly adopts the error correction coding to address the residual isi and fading thus avoid the need to place an equalizer after the time reversal processing song and badiey 2012 yang 2005 in terms of the computational complexity while the core processing of classic mfsk demodulation is fft calculation that only need p 2 log2p multiplications for p point operation it is straightforward that convolution operation of time reversal processor can also be implemented in the form of fft multiplication ifft meanwhile the adoption of down conversion and down resampling leads to further saving of calculation burden thus compared to that of classic mfsk receiver the increasing of complexity in time reversal receiver is still tolerable for practical application 3 the experiment 3 1 experimental configuration the experimental field data was collected at wuyuan bay xiamen china which is a semi enclosed bay shown in fig 2 c with an average depth of about 10 m the mfsk signal was transmitted from a transducer at a depth of 2 m with a source level of about 185 db re 1 μpα at 1 m the transmitted signal was received by a four element broadband receiver array that covering 2 8 m of the water column with an element spacing of 2 m both the transducer and four element receiver are produced by the china shipbuilding industry corporation csic with the model of t16k and ra16k respectively the distance of receiver and source is 1000 m as shown in fig 2 a the sound speed profile is provided in fig 2 b with a sea state of slight wind the parameters of the mfsk modulation and time reversal demodulation are provided in table 1 with the frame structure illustrated in fig 3 the received signals are collected for off line demodulation processing in pc for the purpose of evaluation and comparison the performance of the mfsk demodulation adopting the multi channel time reversal is compared with that of the classical mfsk demodulation to facilitate further performance enhancement convolution coding and interleaving is also adopted to mitigate the residual isi and fading the estimated bulk doppler was 2 hz note that as the purpose of experiment is to evaluate the performance of time reversal at the presence of time variation and multipath no any doppler correction method such as resampling is adopted in mfsk demodulation shown in fig 4 is the channel response of four channels obtained by matched filtering of the lfm sync preamble it is evident that the multipath spans a range of approximate 24 ms which produces severe isi as the duration of mfsk symbol is 13 65 ms the large multipath spread of the experimental channel is caused by the boundary reflections inside the semi enclosed bay meanwhile from fig 4 it can be observed that different channel associated with element at different depth exhibits various multipath structure which indicates the potential for exploring spatial diversity by the means of multichannel time reversal the q function of the multi channel time reversal is provided in fig 5 from which one may see the apparent effect of temporal spatial multipath compression achieve by the multi channel time reversal 3 2 experimental results and discussion a clip of transmitted signal received signal as well as the associated signal at each step of the demodulation is provided in fig 6 in the form of waveform and associated spectrum as indicated by fig 6 a f there are two mfsk symbols that associated with two different frequencies in the clip of transmitted signal after multipath propagation in shallow water channel for received signal these two symbols exhibit substantial frequency selective fading as shown in time domain of fig 6 b and spectrum of fig 6 g respectively thus error demodulation may be produced for fft bins that experience significant fading in fig 6 c and d the receiving mfsk symbols after down conversion and down resampling are shown which is designed to reduce computational complexity but unfortunately fails to address the fading caused by multipath fig 6 e f provided the waveform and spectrum of this clip after time reversal processing respectively which exhibit that the amplitude fading caused by multipath is effectively mitigated fig 7 provides the ber curve with and without time reversal note that channel estimate updating period is one frame for the time reversal receiver associated with the ber curves in fig 7 namely time reversal processing of each frame is performed with the channel response obtained by receiving sync preamble of the frame itself it can be observed from fig 7 that the time reversal receiver outperforms the classic mfsk receiver in ber to be specific for the fourth frame while the classic mfsk receiver corresponds to an original bit error rate ber of 0 1938 and a ber of 0 1042 with encoding the original ber and the encoding ber of the time reversal mfsk receiver is 0 0103 and 0 respectively the reason of the ber performance comparison is that there exist serious isi as the multipath spread of the experimental channel significantly exceeds the symbol duration as a result in the presence of high original ber caused by isi even the employment of error correction encoding fails to improve the performance as indicated by the ber after the 5th frame by effectively suppressing the multipath it is no surprising that the time reversal mfsk receiver yield significant performance improvement moreover it is observable from fig 7 that the ber of mfsk receiver without tr exhibits an obviously rising trend with the increasing of frame number due to the impact of uncompensated doppler this negative trend is also alleviated by the time reversal processing as shown in fig 7 previously similar results have been reported song 2013 in time reversal coherent acoustic communication system indicating the doppler mitigation capability of time reversal a basic assumption of the time reversal is that the channel needs to remain static to ensure the effectiveness which is extremely difficult if not impossible to stand for practical uwa channels it may lead to considerable performance degradation for the time reversal coherent acoustic communication system rouseff et al 2009 as the channel sensitivity coming from both the phase and magnitude variations of channel periodically updating of the channel estimate based on training sequence or previously detected symbols is adopted to guarantee the performance of coherent time reversal zhou et al 2015a b which will unfortunately cause additional overhead or error propagation different from the coherent communication systems because the non coherent demodulation avoids the impact of phase fluctuation time reversal mfsk receiver is expected to offer better robustness upon the channel variations to evaluate the impact of channel variations on time reversal mfsk the performance of the time reversal mfsk receiver that does not update the channel estimate updates the channel estimate every three frames updates the channel estimate every frame is compared respectively it can be seen from the original ber curves in fig 8 that the performance degradation caused by time variation of uwa channel is noticeable with the receiver updating the channel estimate more frequently corresponding to a lower original ber specifically for the tenth frame of data while no updating lead to an original ber of 0 06977 channel estimate updating every three frame and that updating per frame yield an original ber of 0 03876 and 0 007752 respectively moreover it can be observed that for time reversal mfsk receiver the sensitivity to channel variations is still acceptable for applications in practical environment as the time varying channel in a time scale of minute i e 11 frames does not cause intolerable impairment for time reversal mfsk communication 4 conclusion while the mfsk is recognized as a robust way for underwater acoustic communication it is unfortunately subject to tremendous performance degradation at the presence of large multipath spread in this letter we reported a time reversal mfsk receiver to mitigate the isi caused by severe multipath avoiding the need of equalizer the multi channel time reversal processor is incorporated with the classic mfsk receiver to yield enhanced performance the experimental results performed in a shallow water channel are investigated to evaluate the effectiveness of time reversal on mfsk demodulation as the experimental shallow water channel exhibit adverse multipath spread as well as time variation it is no surprise that the conventional mfsk receiver experience significant performance degradation while the effectiveness of multi channel time reversal in mitigating the multipath has been verified by previous investigation based on coherent uwa systems the results obtained in this paper reveal the capability of time reversal in enhancing the mfsk receiver specifically ber comparison between time reversal and classic mfsk receiver quantitatively show that the time reversal is capable of improving the performance of mfsk in the presence of adverse multipath spread the q function of the multi channel time reversal as well as the temporal spectra behavior

advantage of mfsk can be retained in time reversal receiver moreover the benefit that the time reversal mfsk receiver is capable of avoiding the doppler correction was also noticed which is consistent with previous investigation in coherent system furthermore quantitative evaluation with different updating period of channel estimate reveals that time reversal mfsk receiver has the potential of

23589,it has been recognized that compared with coherent acoustic communication multiple frequency shift keying mfsk underwater acoustic communication offers the advantages of low complexity easy implementation and channel tolerance but it is subject to significant performance degradation caused by inter symbol interference isi when the multipath spread is larger than symbol duration the time reversal is capable of effectively suppressing the channel multipath by the means of temporal spatial focusing which has been widely examined and applied in coherent underwater acoustic communication systems however there is a lack of investigations to incorporate the time reversal with mfsk communication in this paper we report a multi channel time reversal mfsk receiver in which the channel estimate is initially obtained and periodically updated by matched filtering of the sync preamble meanwhile down conversion is adopted to reduce computational complexity the performance of the proposed receiver is evaluated in a shallow water channel with severe multipath spread in terms of bit error rate ber and robustness upon time variations keywords multipath isi down conversion time reversal mfsk 1 introduction in view of numerous studies in high bandwidth efficiency coherent acoustic communication technologies such as qpsk zhou et al 2017 ofdm gomes and barroso 2004 and mimo zhou et al 2014 mfsk acoustic communication is still drawing extensive attention from various practical fields due to its low implementation complexity as well as robustness in the presence of severe time frequency selective fading channels however an inherent drawback of the classical mfsk is that it cannot solve the multipath induced inter symbol interference isi when the multipath spread is larger than the symbol duration traditional solutions including adding protection interval or increasing symbol duration are adopted to ensure that the multipath component of the previous symbol does not overlap with the new following symbol both of which unfortunately lead to additional overhead moreover frequency selective fading caused by the multipath components that spanning inside the range of symbol width poses another difficulty to the mfsk systems as the non coherent demodulation totally relies on the comparison of energy associated with each modulated frequencies to obtain correct detection until now the most general method to circumvent the above problem is to adopt different error correction coding such as the non binary ldpc code in fan et al 2014 turbo code in yue et al 2012 and convolutional code in green and rice 2000 to correct the errors caused by isi and frequency selective fading edelmann et al 2002 mousavi et al 2016 stojanovic 2005 while retaining the advantages of mfsk to develop a channel tolerant acoustic communication approach m d green and j a rice green and rice 2000 proposed to incorporate frequency hopping fh with mfsk to overcome the problem caused by multipath however the date rate of the fh mfsk is low as the spread spectrum green and rice 2000 nature of fh means low efficiency of bandwidth utilization in yang and yang 2003 it was reported that different lengths of multipath delays have a significant effect on the bit error rate ber of fsk underwater communication multi channel beamforming as well as the spatial diversity combining is adopted to improve the ber performance moreover yang and yang 2006 found that mfsk ber performance using an incoherent receiver is determined by fading statistics of received signal amplitude which exhibits a non rayleigh behavior and may be modeled as a k distribution x j shu et al shu et al 2016 investigated the chaotic modulation mfsk cmfsk to improve the security for confidential applications however shu et al 2016 also pointed out that in terms of the ber performance under multipath distortion the cmfsk is equivalent to conventional digital modulations being recognized as a promising underwater acoustic uwa channel matching technology zhang and dong 2013 song et al 2008 passive time reversal is capable of overcoming the impairment of multipath by the means of temporal spatial focusing implementation of multi channel time reversal tr processing is generally equivalent to first obtain the multi channel probes that carried the information of uwa channels and then perform time reversal with the received signal of each channel output of which are finally summed up to enable temporal spatial compressing of multipath silva and jesus 2002 currently due to its easily coupling with channel equalizer jamshidi and moezzi 2015a isi cancellation algorithm jamshidi 2011 jamshidi and moezzi 2015b and channel estimator in coherent receiver structure there have been substantial investigations of time reversal in coherent underwater acoustic communication such as those applying the time reversal in ofdm liu and yang 2012 zhou et al 2015a b qpsk xi et al 2015 duan and zheng 2015 and mimo psk zhang et al 2016 it is quite interesting to point out that until now few literature has been reported to incorporate the time reversal with mfsk acoustic communication although both of which are recognized as low complexity and easy implementation in this letter we report our work to apply the time reversal method in the mfsk communication to address the difficulties caused by isi in the presence of severe multipath spread with down conversion a multi channel time reversal mfsk receiver is proposed which adopts the sync preamble as channel probe finally the performance of the proposed method is verified by the sea trial experiment performed in shallow sea channel with large multipath spread based on which the comparison are made to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of time reversal mfsk 2 brief introduction of time reversal and mfsk 2 1 multi channel time reversal zhou et al 2014 for multi channel time reversal system under the assumption that the impulse response of the ith channel h i t remains static within the period the signal received by the ith channel is 1 s i r t s t h i t n i t where s ir t is received signal s t is source signal n i t is local interference noise the symbol represents convolution operation thus the time reversal processing at the ith channel can be expressed as 2 r i t s i r t h i t s t h i t n i t h i t s t h i t h i t n i t h i t s t h i t h i t n i t h i t where h i t is time reverse of the channel response obtained by various estimation methods such as mmse or ls chitre et al 2008 for the multi channel time reversal time reversal output of each channel is summed up to explore spatial diversity of the multipath structure 3 s t i 1 n r i t s t i 1 n h i t h i t i 1 n n i t h i t s t n n t where q t i 1 n h i t h i t defined as q function song et al 2007 is the autocorrelations of the channel response summed over all channels which approaches to an ideal delta t impulse response with an increasing number of receivers song and badiey 2012 nn t is the total noise term therefore after the multi channel time reversal processing multipath is effectively temporally spatially focused to suppress the isi 2 2 the proposed tr mfsk receiver demodulation of mfsk is generally performed with fast fourier transforms ffts and then energy measurement of each fft bins namely using m 16 implies that each mfsk symbols contains 16 fft bins to reduce the computational complexity the ffts demodulation can also be performed after the front end processing of down conversion and down resampling yang 2005 the structure of the proposed multi channel time reversal mfsk receiver is shown in fig 1 as fig 1 indicates after the down conversion and down resampling the matched filtering output of the sync preamble is used as the measured channel response for time reversal processing time reversal output of each channel is summed up for the final mfsk demodulation to yield temporal spatial multipath suppression note that compared with contemporary coherent time reversal receiver the time reversal mfsk directly adopts the error correction coding to address the residual isi and fading thus avoid the need to place an equalizer after the time reversal processing song and badiey 2012 yang 2005 in terms of the computational complexity while the core processing of classic mfsk demodulation is fft calculation that only need p 2 log2p multiplications for p point operation it is straightforward that convolution operation of time reversal processor can also be implemented in the form of fft multiplication ifft meanwhile the adoption of down conversion and down resampling leads to further saving of calculation burden thus compared to that of classic mfsk receiver the increasing of complexity in time reversal receiver is still tolerable for practical application 3 the experiment 3 1 experimental configuration the experimental field data was collected at wuyuan bay xiamen china which is a semi enclosed bay shown in fig 2 c with an average depth of about 10 m the mfsk signal was transmitted from a transducer at a depth of 2 m with a source level of about 185 db re 1 μpα at 1 m the transmitted signal was received by a four element broadband receiver array that covering 2 8 m of the water column with an element spacing of 2 m both the transducer and four element receiver are produced by the china shipbuilding industry corporation csic with the model of t16k and ra16k respectively the distance of receiver and source is 1000 m as shown in fig 2 a the sound speed profile is provided in fig 2 b with a sea state of slight wind the parameters of the mfsk modulation and time reversal demodulation are provided in table 1 with the frame structure illustrated in fig 3 the received signals are collected for off line demodulation processing in pc for the purpose of evaluation and comparison the performance of the mfsk demodulation adopting the multi channel time reversal is compared with that of the classical mfsk demodulation to facilitate further performance enhancement convolution coding and interleaving is also adopted to mitigate the residual isi and fading the estimated bulk doppler was 2 hz note that as the purpose of experiment is to evaluate the performance of time reversal at the presence of time variation and multipath no any doppler correction method such as resampling is adopted in mfsk demodulation shown in fig 4 is the channel response of four channels obtained by matched filtering of the lfm sync preamble it is evident that the multipath spans a range of approximate 24 ms which produces severe isi as the duration of mfsk symbol is 13 65 ms the large multipath spread of the experimental channel is caused by the boundary reflections inside the semi enclosed bay meanwhile from fig 4 it can be observed that different channel associated with element at different depth exhibits various multipath structure which indicates the potential for exploring spatial diversity by the means of multichannel time reversal the q function of the multi channel time reversal is provided in fig 5 from which one may see the apparent effect of temporal spatial multipath compression achieve by the multi channel time reversal 3 2 experimental results and discussion a clip of transmitted signal received signal as well as the associated signal at each step of the demodulation is provided in fig 6 in the form of waveform and associated spectrum as indicated by fig 6 a f there are two mfsk symbols that associated with two different frequencies in the clip of transmitted signal after multipath propagation in shallow water channel for received signal these two symbols exhibit substantial frequency selective fading as shown in time domain of fig 6 b and spectrum of fig 6 g respectively thus error demodulation may be produced for fft bins that experience significant fading in fig 6 c and d the receiving mfsk symbols after down conversion and down resampling are shown which is designed to reduce computational complexity but unfortunately fails to address the fading caused by multipath fig 6 e f provided the waveform and spectrum of this clip after time reversal processing respectively which exhibit that the amplitude fading caused by multipath is effectively mitigated fig 7 provides the ber curve with and without time reversal note that channel estimate updating period is one frame for the time reversal receiver associated with the ber curves in fig 7 namely time reversal processing of each frame is performed with the channel response obtained by receiving sync preamble of the frame itself it can be observed from fig 7 that the time reversal receiver outperforms the classic mfsk receiver in ber to be specific for the fourth frame while the classic mfsk receiver corresponds to an original bit error rate ber of 0 1938 and a ber of 0 1042 with encoding the original ber and the encoding ber of the time reversal mfsk receiver is 0 0103 and 0 respectively the reason of the ber performance comparison is that there exist serious isi as the multipath spread of the experimental channel significantly exceeds the symbol duration as a result in the presence of high original ber caused by isi even the employment of error correction encoding fails to improve the performance as indicated by the ber after the 5th frame by effectively suppressing the multipath it is no surprising that the time reversal mfsk receiver yield significant performance improvement moreover it is observable from fig 7 that the ber of mfsk receiver without tr exhibits an obviously rising trend with the increasing of frame number due to the impact of uncompensated doppler this negative trend is also alleviated by the time reversal processing as shown in fig 7 previously similar results have been reported song 2013 in time reversal coherent acoustic communication system indicating the doppler mitigation capability of time reversal a basic assumption of the time reversal is that the channel needs to remain static to ensure the effectiveness which is extremely difficult if not impossible to stand for practical uwa channels it may lead to considerable performance degradation for the time reversal coherent acoustic communication system rouseff et al 2009 as the channel sensitivity coming from both the phase and magnitude variations of channel periodically updating of the channel estimate based on training sequence or previously detected symbols is adopted to guarantee the performance of coherent time reversal zhou et al 2015a b which will unfortunately cause additional overhead or error propagation different from the coherent communication systems because the non coherent demodulation avoids the impact of phase fluctuation time reversal mfsk receiver is expected to offer better robustness upon the channel variations to evaluate the impact of channel variations on time reversal mfsk the performance of the time reversal mfsk receiver that does not update the channel estimate updates the channel estimate every three frames updates the channel estimate every frame is compared respectively it can be seen from the original ber curves in fig 8 that the performance degradation caused by time variation of uwa channel is noticeable with the receiver updating the channel estimate more frequently corresponding to a lower original ber specifically for the tenth frame of data while no updating lead to an original ber of 0 06977 channel estimate updating every three frame

acceptable for applications in practical environment as the time varying channel in a time scale of minute i e 11 frames does not cause intolerable impairment for time reversal mfsk communication 4
