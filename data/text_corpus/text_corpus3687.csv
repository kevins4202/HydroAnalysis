these granular adsorbents are mainly limited by low fe utilization and slow adsorption kinetics in this study iron oxide nanoneedle array decorated biochar fibers fe nn bfs adsorbents have been

increasing as removal kinetics and capacity batch experiments show that the adsorption capacities of fe nn bfs for as v and as iii reach to 93 94 and 70 22 mg g fe at ph 7 0 respectively as v levels 275 μg l in groundwater are rapidly reduced less than 5 min to below 10 μg l using fe nn bfs 1 g l at ph 6 7 similar as iii levels can be reduced to below 10 μg l within 30 min by fe nn bfs 1 5 g l in

packed column can be easily regenerated and reused many times after four regenerations the treatment volume of as v and as iii were reduced by 10 4 and 22 8 respectively graphical abstract image 1 keywords biochar fibers iron nanoneedles arsenic adsorption column operation 1 introduction arsenic as contamination in groundwater has been an environmental issue for many decades nordstrom 2002 excessive and prolonged exposure to as can cause serious health problems such as skin lesions and cancers brown and ross 2002 even now millions of people face the threat of as particularly in developing countries rodríguez lado et al 2013 winkel et al 2008 adsorption is deemed the most effective technique for removing as from groundwater mohanty 2017 tang et al 2013 wei et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 diverse adsorbents have been explored for as removal cui et al 2013 xu et al 2010 zhao et al 2011 in particular iron oxide nanoparticles have attracted much attention due to their high adsorption capacity and low cost dixit and hering 2003 liu et al 2015 luong et al 2018 peng et al 2017 however nanosized adsorbents suffer serious aggregation and separation problems moreover they are not suitable for column processes due to the excessive pressure drop in these processes granulation technology is often used to solve these problems in practice driehaus 2002 however the widely used granular ferric hydroxide gfh adsorbents still suffer a severe head loss within a short operating time due to their poor mechanical strength jang et al 2008 selvin et al 2000 sperlich et al 2005 fixing nanosized iron oxides onto appropriate supports is an effective strategy to overcome these drawbacks li et al 2016 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 biochar is increasingly considered a supporting material for iron oxide particles due to its good stability and low cost cope et al 2014 hu et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 usually these sorbents are prepared by either pyrolyzing fe precursor loaded biomass or by directly immobilizing iron oxide particles onto biochar however these fe based biochar adsorbents contain many bottleneck micropore or mesopore shapes and most of the iron oxide particles are distributed inside the pores that are out of reach of as it is difficult for solution to enter these pores due to the internal pressure and the surface tension of water resulting in slow kinetics and low iron utilization dozens of hours or even a week is required to reach adsorption equilibrium for these fe based biochars baig et al 2014 wang et al 2015a 2015b in fact practical column filtration has a typical empty bed contact time of a few minutes this leads to minimize the utilization of adsorption capacity at column breakthrough 10 μg l therefore a rational immobilization of iron oxide particles onto suitable biochars is in great demand for enhancing adsorption rates and iron utilization biochar fibers bfs are a good support candidate because it provides a large outer surface area for fixing iron oxide and the iron oxide fixed on the surface of fibers can be fully exposed to the pollutants wu et al 2013 increased as adsorption kinetics and capacity can be expected because of the more easily and rapidly accessible adsorption sites in addition the rational arrangement of nanoparticles on supports can accelerate adsorption kinetics and increase adsorption capacity compared to randomly aggregated nanoparticles orderly nanostructures are conducive to enhancing mass transport rates and contact area improving reaction efficiency and increasing adsorption site utilization yan et al 2015 due to its low cost ready availability and nontoxicity raw cotton fiber is a promising raw material for the fabrication of bfs bi et al 2013 in this study vertical iron oxide nanoneedle array decorated biochar fibers fe nn bfs were prepared through a simple hydrothermal reaction without using organic reagents as only needs to diffuse from the bulk of the solution to the fiber surface short diffusion distance instead of to the interior as compared to granular adsorbent resulting in faster adsorption kinetics scheme 1 a moreover the fully exposed iron oxide would maximize the fe utilization resulting in high adsorption capacity furthermore the fiber filled fixed bed column would have a large porosity which can effectively reduce the pressure drop scheme 1b so due to its innovative structure the fe nn bfs possesses advantages high efficiency for as removal and convenient operation for fixed bed column process as removal by fe nn bfs was examined in batch experiments the effect of solution chemistry on the as removal was systematically investigated an adsorption mechanism was proposed fixed bed experiments with as spiked natural groundwater as well as regeneration experiments were employed to evaluate the potential of fe nn bfs for practical application this study provides new insights for the rational design of fe based adsorbent for fast and efficient removal of as from groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials cotton fiber was obtained from waste cotton ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o and sodium sulfate na2so4 were purchased from the sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai p r china humic acid ha was purchased from aladdin bio chem technology co ltd shanghai p r china as v stock solutions were prepared with deionized water

water the natural groundwater collected from a well in changsha hunan china the water quality analysis of the natural groundwater is presented in table s1 supporting information 2 2 synthesis of fe nn bfs preparation of biochar fibers bfs pieces of cotton were rinsed with deionized water then the dried cotton was transferred to a tubular furnace for pyrolysis at 800 c for 2 h in a nitrogen atmosphere finally the furnace was naturally cooled to room temperature to obtain bfs bi et al 2013 the obtained bfs were immersed in hno3 solution 50 v v at room temperature for 5 h to enhance its hydrophilicity which is advantageous for growing iron oxide on its surface it was washed with deionized water to neutral and dried for modification fe nn bfs were prepared through a hydrothermal reaction in a typical procedure 0 81 g of fecl3 6h2o and 0 48 g of na2so4 were dissolved in 60 ml of h2o then 0 25 g of bfs was immersed in the mixed solution which was then ultrasonicated for 30 min to allow the ions to fully diffuse into the interior of the biochar fibers mass next the sample was transferred into an 80 ml container in an autoclave and heated at 120 c for 6 h for the growth of iron oxide on the surface of the fibers finally the as prepared samples denoted as fe nn bfs were collected washed with deionized water several times and dried at 60 c in vacuum for comparative purpose the iron oxide nanoneedles fe nns was prepared according to similar hydrothermal procedures except that no bfs were added 2 3 characterizations the crystal phases of the samples were collected

the structure and composition of the samples the content of fe in fe nn bfsfs was measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes spectro blue sop germany the contact angles were tested at room temperature by the jc2000d2 contact angle measurement shanghai zhongchen digital technique apparatus co ltd shanghai china 2 4 batch experiments unless otherwise specified batch adsorption experiments were carried out in as spiked deionized water in a rotary shaker at 25 c and 160 rpm the fe content in fe nn bfs was 8 6 wt the initial ph values of the as solutions were adjusted with hcl solution or naoh solution the dosage of fe nn bfs was fixed at 1 g l after shaking the sample for a certain time the solids were collected by filtration through 0 22 μm polyethersulfone membrane filters the residual as in solution was determined by an atomic fluorescence spectrophotometer afs 9700 beijing haiguang instrument inc beijing p r china experiments to determine kinetics were performed by adding predetermined amount of adsorbent to a 50 ml glass vessel containing 40 ml of 0 911 mg l as solution the solution ph was adjusted to 7 about 0 5 ml solution was collected at certain time intervals for the determination of the residual as for adsorption isotherms the initial as iii and as v concentration varied from 1 mg l to 60 mg l the solution ph was adjusted to 7 and the contact time was set at 72 h to investigate the effect of the solution ph on as adsorption the ph value of the aqueous solution was adjusted and maintained between 4 and 10 the effect of ions and natural organic matters on the as removal was examined in the presence of na2co3 na2so4 na2sio3 na3po4 nacl or humic acid to examine performance of fe nn bfs for practical application the experiments was carried out with as spiked natural groundwater the spiked as iii and as v concentrations were 275 μg l 2 5 column experiments column experiments were carried out at ambient temperature using fe nn bfs 2 g for one column packed in fixed bed columns 12 mm in diameter and 100 mm in length fig s1 as v or as iii spiked natural groundwater containing as 275 μg l was used as the feeding solution about 10 mm thick of quartz wool was used at each end of the column to distribute the flow the effective bed volume bv of one column was 9 04 ml a peristaltic pump was used to maintain an upward flow in the column and 0 1 m naoh solution ph 13 was used as the eluting agent for as desorption the empty bed contact time ebct was set as 4 min and the flow rate was 2 26 ml min 2 6 kinetics and isotherms models the pseudo first order eq 1 and the pseudo second order eq 2 models are as follows 1 q t q e 1 exp k 1 t 2 q t q e 1 1 1 q e k 2 t where q e and q t mg g are the amount of as adsorbed at equilibrium and at time t min respectively k 1 min 1 and k 2 g mg min are the related adsorption rate constants langmuir eq 3 and freundlich eq 4 models are as follows 3 q

f and n are the freundlich adsorption constants 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of fe nn bfs fig 1 a illustrates the sem images of the biochar fibers bfs the bfs showed a twisted morphology and an average diameter of approximate 5 μm the generated biochar fibers were very light and a bunch of fibers could well stand on the leaves of asparagus inset fig 1a the surface of the bare bfs was smooth fig 1b after the growth of fe nns during the hydrothermal reaction the surface morphology of fe nns changed significantly as compared to the original bfs and highly dense iron oxide nanoneedles were uniformly grown onto the surface of biochar fibers fig 1c the average density of the fe nn bfs mass is about 64 mg cm 3 inset fig 1c the magnified view of fe nn bfs showed that the nanoneedle arrays radially outward around the surface of the biochar fibers fig 1d the iron oxide nanoneedles had a diameter of 80 nm and a length of 500 nm fig 1e eds was performed to identify the element compositions of fe nn bfs fig s2 c was derived from bfs whereas fe o and cl were assigned to akaganeite the cu and s were from the copper grid and residual sulfate ions respectively xps survey spectra confirmed the presence of c fe o and cl fig s3 a high resolution tem hrtem image of the nanoneedles showed the characteristic akaganeite 21 1 plane with the d spacing of 0 2555 nm inset fig 1e the xrd patterns further confirmed that these nanoneedles were made of akaganeite fe8o8 oh 8cl1 35 β feooh pdf no 80 1770 and the clear diffraction peaks indicated that the akaganeite has a relatively good crystalline fig 1f the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area increased from 2 45 m2 g for bfs to 8 68 m2 g for fe nn bfs the content of fe in fe nn bfs was determined to be 8 6 wt from icp oes analysis furthermore fe nn bfs were highly hydrophilic with a contact angle of 0 while bfs had a high contact angle of 58 36 fig s4 the result indicated that water could quickly permeate fe nn bfs packed column with a low pressure drop 3 2 as removal kinetics the kinetics of as v and as iii removal by bfs fe nn bfs and fe nns are shown in fig 2 the bare bfs showed no adsorption of as v and as iii suggesting that the adsorption of as onto fe nn bfs was attributable to fe nns the adsorptions of both as v and as iii onto fe nn bfs were very rapid especially for as v all 100 as v c 0 911 μg l was removed within 10 min using 2 g l adsorbent and within 15 min using 1 g l adsorbent using 0 5 g l adsorbent removed 100 as v in 120 min in addition the adsorption equilibrium of as iii c 0 911 μg l was reached in approximately 60 min using 2 g l adsorbent and 240 min using 0 5 g l adsorbent the time to equilibrium for this material was considerably faster than that for other fe based biochar adsorbents where the equilibrium times were longer than 24 h wang et al 2015a 2015b the fast adsorption of as was ascribed to the short diffusion distance and the high accessibility of adsorption sites liu et al 2014 2019 yang et al 2019 certainly immobilizing nanoparticles on the support would consume available nanoparticles surface area peter et al 2017 savina et al 2011 a three fold reduction in adsorption capacity was observed when loading the free α fe2o3 and fe3o4 nanoparticles on macroporous polymer savina et al 2011 impressively 2 g l fe nn bfs performed higher as v adsorption than 0 27 g l freely dispersed fe nns normalized to 2 g l fe nn bfs and nearly equivalent as iii adsorption compared to freely dispersed fe nns the structure of the exhausted fe nn bfs after regeneration by 0 1 m naoh was characterized using sem fig s5 as observed the fiber surface was still covered by high density iron oxide nanoneedles which is similar to the structure of the virgin fe nn bfs fig 1c suggesting that the fe nn bfs have a good structural stability the kinetics data of as v and as iii adsorption by fe nn bfs were fitted to pseudo first order and pseudo second order models the fitting kinetics parameters are summarized in table s2 the adsorption was well described by the pseudo second order kinetic model indicating that the adsorption process might be a chemisorption zhang et al 2013 higher k for as v adsorption suggests that the removal effect of fe nn bfs on as v was faster than on as iii it is possibly because the adsorption energy of as v is different from that of as iii luo et al 2016 when as v or as iii was adsorbed on iron oxide minerals the adsorption complexes formed are different because as v is negatively charged and its molecular volume is larger than as iii farquhar et al 2002 guo et al 2007 liu et al 2015 resulting in different adsorption energy farrell and chaudhary 2013 3 3 as adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms can provide insight into the adsorptive performance of adsorbents toward as fig 3 showed the isotherms of as v and as iii adsorption on fe nn bfs considering that as was hardly adsorbed on bfs the adsorption capacity of fe nn bfs was normalized to the mass of fe the as in the low concentration range could be effectively removed by fe nn bfs it is very meaningful for its practical applications because the concentration of as in most of the as contaminated waters does not exceed 1 5 mg l smedley and kinniburgh 2002 both langmuir and freundlich models were used to describe the adsorption isotherms the adsorption constants are listed in table s3 the obtained correlation coefficients r 2 for the langmuir model were higher than those for the freundlich model indicative of a monomolecular layer adsorption on fe nn bfs luo et al 2019 the maximal adsorption capacities for as v and as iii from the langmuir model were 93 94 and 70 22 mg g fe respectively the normalized maximum adsorption capacities of fe nn bfs were higher than those of other iron oxide biochar based adsorbents table s4 demonstrating the high fe utilization of fe nn bfs 3 4 effect of solution chemistry the influence of ionic strength on as adsorption was investigated as shown in fig s6 the ionic strength had a negligible effect on the adsorption of as v and as iii this result indicated that the adsorption of as v and as iii onto fe nn bfs followed the inner sphere complex mechanism because nonspecifically adsorbed ions are more sensitive to changes in ionic strength than specifically adsorbed ions stumm 1992 the ph in solution can impact adsorbate states and the surface charges of adsorbents the effect of ph on the removal of as v and as iii by fe nn bfs is shown in fig 4 a the as v adsorption on fe nn bfs was maintained at above 99 at ph values below 9 when the ph was increased to 10 the removal percentage decreased to 77 the point of zero charge phpzc of fe nn bfs was 3 7 fig s7 so the surface was negatively charged in the studied ph range 4 10 thus physical absorption would be inhibited by the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged adsorbent and as v anions h2aso4 and haso4 2 and the adsorption of as v is mainly attributed to chemical adsorption shan and tong 2013 the as iii adsorption gradually increased with increasing ph and reached a maximum at ph 9 the dominant form of as iii in the ph range from 4 to 9 2 is h3aso3 therefore as iii was adsorbed onto fe nn bfs through a surface complexation mechanism rather than electrostatic interactions a proton originally associated with oxygen at the feooh surface would be released when an as o fe bond formed an increase in ph favored the association between as iii and feooh enhancing as adsorption liu et al 2008 manning et al 1998 as the ph increased above 9 2 as iii gradually became negatively charged h2aso3 and the electrostatic repulsion between as iii and the negatively charged surface became stronger causing a decrease in as iii adsorption considering the complex chemistry of natural groundwater the effect of humic acid and some ubiquitous ions on as removal was examined as shown in fig 4b humic acid had no obvious effect on the as v and as iii adsorption this favorable properties against humic acid is possibly due to the surface of the adsorbent being negatively charged at ph 7 which does not favor the adsorption of the electron rich humic acid thus the occupation of adsorption sites on the adsorbent by humic acid was very limited the effects of coexisting ions on the removal of as by fe nn bfs are depicted in fig 4c and d calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sulfate so4 2 and carbonate co3 2 ions had a slightly negative effect on as v and as iii removal in the studied concentration ranges stachowicz et al have reported that calcium magnesium and carbonate have no significant effect on as adsorption even though they form inner sphere complexation with α feooh stachowicz et al 2008 it is because their affinity was considerably lower than as brechbühl et al 2012 stachowicz et al 2007 2008 radu et al also found that even very high concentration of bicarbonate 3 6 mm inhibited the as removal slightly radu et al 2005 the sulfate usually forms out sphere complexation with ferric hydr oxides at ph 6 lefèvre 2004 rather than forming more firmly bonded inner sphere complexation therefore the sulfate suppressed as uptake slightly in contrast silicate and phosphate hindered the adsorption of as v and as iii and the inhibition increases with increasing their concentration especially at high concentration of phosphate it is because they could also form firmly bonded inner sphere complexation with metal oxides like as khare et al 2005 luxton et al 2008 in particular phosphate shared considerable chemical similarity with as arai and sparks 2001 so silicate and phosphate will compete with as for adsorption sites especially phosphate resulting in reduced the uptake of as typical silicate and phosphate concentration in groundwater are 0 45 15 mg l meng et al 2000 and 0 02 0 6 mg l roberts et al 2004 respectively the removal efficiency could be enhanced by appropriately increasing the fe nn bfs dosage 3 5 xps analysis the chemical composition of fe nn bfs before and after as adsorption was determined by xps new as 3d peaks appeared in the full survey of xps spectra after the adsorption of as v or as iii fig s8 demonstrating the adsorption of as onto fe nn bfs fig 5 a showed the as3d core levels of as v and as iii adsorbed on fe nn bfs the binding energies of the as 3d core levels of as v and as iii in as oxides were 45 9 46 3 ev and 44 7 45 2 ev respectively wanger et al 1979 the binding energy of as v remained unchangeable during adsorption in contrast the as 3d peak of adsorbed as iii could be fitted by two peaks one at 46 1 ev for as v and the other at 44 7 ev for as iii this result indicated that some of as iii was oxidized to as v during adsorption similar result was observed for the partly oxidation of as iii to as v on the ferrihydrite surface in the presence of oxygen in which ferrihydrite acted as the catalyst zhao et al 2011 to study the effect of dissolved oxygen we performed as iii adsorption experiments under anaerobic condition fig s9 without dissolved oxygen the oxidation of as iii was greatly suppressed the result indicated the dissolved oxygen functioned as the as iii oxidant when iron oxide was present jang et al proposed that the formation of complexation is required for as iii oxidation jang and dempsey 2008 the oxidation process could be proposed the as iii was first adsorbed on the iron oxide to form a as iii surface complex and then reacted with the dissolved oxygen and the as iii surface complex was converted into as v surface complex note that in anaerobic conditions traces of as iii oxidation may be attributed to oxygen containing functional groups on the biochar fibers the surface interactions between as and fe nn bfs were investigated by analyzing the o 1s xps patterns of fe nn bfs before and after as v or as iii adsorption fig 5b peaks at 529 8 531 4 and 532 5 ev represent the o in the lattice m o o in hydroxyl groups m oh and o in adsorbed h2o respectively liu et al 2016 the ratio of om oh to om o decreased from 0 96 to 0 87 and 0 88 after the adsorption of as v and as iii respectively these results indicated that the fe oh should be involved in the as adsorption with the formation of fe o as bonds further confirming that the adsorption followed the inner sphere complex mechanism 3 6 as removal from natural groundwater as removal by fe nn bfs was performed in as spiked natural groundwater sampling in a well c 0 275 μg l fig 6 for as v spiked natural groundwater 97 1 as v was removed in only 5 min using 1 g l fe nn bfs and the residual as v was 7 95 μg l for as iii spiked natural groundwater 90 as iii was removed within 120 min using 1 g l fe nn bfs and the as iii concentration decreased to 27 33 μg l the equilibrium as concentration in the treated water samples could be further reduced by appropriately increasing the dosage of fe nn bfs inset fig 6 the residual as iii concentration could be reduced to 1 22 μg l within 30 min using 1 5 g l fe nn bfs the residual as iii concentration dropped to 5 31 μg l in 15 min when increasing the adsorbent dose to 2 0 g l it was agreed well with the as iii removal kinetics results these results demonstrated that the fe nn bfs adsorbent had a highly practical application for as removal form natural groundwater 3 7 regeneration reuse and column operation of fe nn bfs reusability is an important criterion for evaluating the practicality of adsorbents conventional batch experiments are usually used for evaluating the reusability column operation is more suitable for practical applications column experiments were conducted to remove as v and as iii from as spiked groundwater fig 7 a and b showed the breakthrough curves of fe nn bfs adsorbing as v and as iii c 0 275 μg l using one column respectively at an ebct of 4 0 min the effective treatment volume was 1350 bed volumes bv 12 2 l for as v and 350 bv 3 16 l for as iii in the first cycle when the breakthrough point was set to 10 μg l the batch experiments described above showed the faster adsorption kinetics and larger adsorption capacity for as v than that for as iii by fe nn bfs the column experiment results accorded well with the adsorption kinetics and isotherm study the exhausted fe nn bfs column was easily regenerated by 0 1 m naoh solution ph 13 in total 95 as v and 92 as iii could be eluted with only 20 bv 180 8 ml of eluent fig s10 the effective treatment volume of the fe nn bfs column for as decreased as the number of regeneration cycle increased however the decrease was not significant and the effective treatment volumes for as v and as iii in the fifth cycle were still 1210 bv and 270 bv respectively the recycle performances of fe nn bfs column for as v and as iii removal were much better than the values reported in the studies using gfh which maintained less than 50 performance in the fourth regeneration thirunavukkarasu et al 2003 additionally the iron released from the column was below 0 05 mg l indicative of a good stability of fe nn bfs the potential performance of fe nn bfs in practical applications was further evaluated by using two columns in tandem to treat as spiked groundwater the breakthrough curves for as v and as iii are depicted in fig 7c the effective treatment volume reached 2900 bv for as v which was 2 15 times higher than that of a single column for as v attractively the effective treatment volume reached 2500 bv for as iii which was 7 14 times not the linear value of 2 times higher than that for single column obviously two column operation allowed a more efficient utilization of adsorption sites in the first column and longer ebct fig s11 guo and chen 2005 it is because the first adsorption column would continue to adsorb as as long as the second adsorption column was breakthrough of 10 μg l or the first adsorption completely breakthrough the column as adsorption density q column at the breakthrough point of 10 μg l was 1 80 and 1 55 mg g fe nn bfs for as v and as iii respectively the q column was comparable to that of commercially available adsorbents such as gfh and bayoxide e33 badruzzaman and westerhoff 2006 the single column experiment was also performed for treatment of as spiked natural groundwater containing both as v and as iii as v 25 μg l and as iii 25 μg l the pressure drop as a function of the treatment volume of the column was measured results are shown in fig 7d the breakthrough of 10 μg l occurred at 11000 bv experiencing a continuous operation for a month the treatment bed volume and the corresponding q column are attractive compared to these previously reported similar processes using other fe modified biochar activated carbon adsorbents table s5 in addition the pressure drop was increased slowly as the treatment volume increased after 9000 bv treatment volume the pressure drop was only 40 kpa moreover the pressure drop was reduced to the original level when the quartz wool was replaced at the bottom of the column this result suggested that the increase in pressure drop may be due to the silt blocking of the adsorbent only at the bottom rather than the crumbling of adsorbent structural stability is a desired characteristic for adsorbents in column process especially when it experiences prolonged use jang et al 2008 the fe nn bfs adsorbent showed a lower headloss pressure compared to the reported gfh theis et al 1992 the headloss pressure of gfh packed column rose quickly due to the crumbling of gfh and it became more serious after backwashing selvin et al 2000 the exhausted fe nn bfs at the bottom and top of the column were analyzed using sem fig s12 some solids were wrapped around the surface of the bottom sample the main components of the solid are silica and organic matter fig s13 this phenomenon did not occur in the top sample thus the contamination of the sample was the reason for the occurrence of headloss pressure in practical applications the contamination of the adsorbent could be effectively reduced by periodically replacing the quartz wool at the bottom attractively the iron oxide nanoneedles were still well fixed to the surface of the biochar fiber and the biochar fiber not disintegrated regardless of the bottom or top sample suggesting that fe nn bfs could withstand long term use for removal of as from groundwater 4 conclusions it is always desirable to develop economically viable and highly efficient adsorbents for as removal from groundwater a novel fe nn bfs was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal reaction without any organic reagent the iron oxide nanoneedles well ordered fixed on the surface of biochar fibers the prepared fe nn bfs showed high fe utilization and fast adsorption rate the maximal adsorption capacities for as v and as iii are 93 94 and 70 22 mg g fe at ph 7 0 its adsorption rate for as is much faster than most iron oxide modified biochar materials it could effectively remove as contamination in natural groundwater the fe nn bfs is efficiently applied to bed columns for the treatment of as contaminated groundwater the satisfactory recycle performance of fe nn bfs might reduce operating costs due to the highly hydrophilic nature and interconnected pore structure of fe nn bfs packed column the column exhibits good hydraulic characteristics during the long term application the cost of fe nns bff is approximately us 5 14 103 t much lower than reported carbon materials see supporting information in

al 2017 diverse adsorbents have been explored for as removal cui et al 2013 xu et al 2010 zhao et al 2011 in particular iron oxide nanoparticles have attracted much attention due to their high adsorption capacity and low cost dixit and hering 2003 liu et al 2015 luong et al 2018 peng et al 2017 however nanosized adsorbents suffer serious aggregation and separation problems moreover they are not suitable for column processes due to the excessive pressure drop in these processes granulation technology is often used to solve these problems in practice driehaus 2002 however the widely used granular ferric hydroxide gfh adsorbents still suffer a severe head loss within a short operating time due to their poor mechanical strength jang et al 2008 selvin et al 2000 sperlich et al 2005 fixing nanosized iron oxides onto appropriate supports is an effective strategy to overcome these drawbacks li et al 2016 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 biochar is increasingly considered a supporting material for iron oxide particles due to its good stability and low cost cope et al 2014 hu et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 usually these sorbents are prepared by either pyrolyzing fe precursor loaded biomass or by directly immobilizing iron oxide particles onto biochar however these fe based biochar adsorbents contain many bottleneck micropore or mesopore shapes and most of the iron oxide particles are distributed inside the pores that are out of reach of as it is difficult for solution to enter these pores due to the internal pressure and the surface tension of water resulting in slow kinetics and low iron utilization dozens of hours or even a week is required to reach adsorption equilibrium for these fe based biochars baig et al 2014 wang et al 2015a 2015b in fact practical column filtration has a typical empty bed contact time of a few minutes this leads to minimize the utilization of adsorption capacity at column breakthrough 10 μg l therefore a rational immobilization of iron oxide particles onto suitable biochars is in great demand for enhancing adsorption rates and iron utilization biochar fibers bfs are a good support candidate because it provides a large outer surface area for fixing iron oxide and the iron oxide fixed on the surface of fibers can be fully exposed to the pollutants wu et al 2013 increased as adsorption kinetics and capacity can be expected because of the more easily and rapidly accessible adsorption sites in addition the rational arrangement of nanoparticles on supports can accelerate adsorption kinetics and increase adsorption capacity compared to randomly aggregated nanoparticles orderly nanostructures are conducive to enhancing mass transport rates and contact area improving reaction efficiency and increasing adsorption site utilization yan et al 2015 due to its low cost ready availability and nontoxicity raw cotton fiber is a promising raw material for the fabrication of bfs bi et al 2013 in this study vertical iron oxide nanoneedle array decorated biochar fibers fe nn bfs were prepared through a simple hydrothermal reaction without using organic reagents as only needs to diffuse from the bulk of the solution to the fiber surface short diffusion distance instead of to the interior as compared to granular adsorbent resulting in faster adsorption kinetics scheme 1 a moreover the fully exposed iron oxide would maximize the fe utilization resulting in high adsorption capacity furthermore the fiber filled fixed bed column would have a large porosity which can effectively reduce the pressure drop scheme 1b so due to its innovative structure the fe nn bfs possesses advantages high efficiency for as removal and convenient operation for fixed bed column process as removal by fe nn bfs was examined in batch experiments the effect of solution chemistry on the as removal was systematically investigated an adsorption mechanism was proposed fixed bed experiments with as spiked natural groundwater as well as regeneration experiments were employed to evaluate the potential of fe nn bfs for practical application this study provides new insights for the rational design of fe based adsorbent for fast and efficient removal of as from groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials cotton fiber was obtained from waste cotton ferric chloride fecl3 6h2o and sodium sulfate na2so4 were purchased from the sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai p r china humic acid ha was purchased from aladdin bio chem technology co ltd shanghai p r china as v stock solutions were prepared with deionized water

water the natural groundwater collected from a well in changsha hunan china the water quality analysis of the natural groundwater is presented in table s1 supporting information 2 2 synthesis of fe nn bfs preparation of biochar fibers bfs pieces of cotton were rinsed with deionized water then the dried cotton was transferred to a tubular furnace for pyrolysis at 800 c for 2 h in a nitrogen atmosphere finally the furnace was naturally cooled to room temperature to obtain bfs bi et al 2013 the obtained bfs were immersed in hno3 solution 50 v v at room temperature for 5 h to enhance its hydrophilicity which is advantageous for growing iron oxide on its surface it was washed with deionized water to neutral and dried for modification fe nn bfs were prepared through a hydrothermal reaction in a typical procedure 0 81 g of fecl3 6h2o and 0 48 g of na2so4 were dissolved in 60 ml of h2o then 0 25 g of bfs was immersed in the mixed solution which was then ultrasonicated for 30 min to allow the ions to fully diffuse into the interior of the biochar fibers mass next the sample was transferred into an 80 ml container in an autoclave and heated at 120 c for 6 h for the growth of iron oxide on the surface of the fibers finally the as prepared samples denoted as fe nn bfs were collected washed with deionized water several times and dried at 60 c in vacuum for comparative purpose the iron oxide nanoneedles fe nns was prepared according to similar hydrothermal procedures except that no bfs were added 2 3 characterizations the crystal phases of the samples were collected

the structure and composition of the samples the content of fe in fe nn bfsfs was measured using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes spectro blue sop germany the contact angles were tested at room temperature by the jc2000d2 contact angle measurement shanghai zhongchen digital technique apparatus co ltd shanghai china 2 4 batch experiments unless otherwise specified batch adsorption experiments were carried out in as spiked deionized water in a rotary shaker at 25 c and 160 rpm the fe content in fe nn bfs was 8 6 wt the initial ph values of the as solutions were adjusted with hcl solution or naoh solution the dosage of fe nn bfs was fixed at 1 g l after shaking the sample for a certain time the solids were collected by filtration through 0 22 μm polyethersulfone membrane filters the residual as in solution was determined by an atomic fluorescence spectrophotometer afs 9700 beijing haiguang instrument inc beijing p r china experiments to determine kinetics were performed by adding predetermined amount of adsorbent to a 50 ml glass vessel containing 40 ml of 0 911 mg l as solution the solution ph was adjusted to 7 about 0 5 ml solution was collected at certain time intervals for the determination of the residual as for adsorption isotherms the initial as iii and as v concentration varied from 1 mg l to 60 mg l the solution ph was adjusted to 7 and the contact time was set at 72 h to investigate the effect of the solution ph on as adsorption the ph value of the aqueous solution was adjusted and maintained between 4 and 10 the effect of ions and natural organic matters on the as removal was examined in the presence of na2co3 na2so4 na2sio3 na3po4 nacl or humic acid to examine performance of fe nn bfs for practical application the experiments was carried out with as spiked natural groundwater the spiked as iii and as v concentrations were 275 μg l 2 5 column experiments column experiments were carried out at ambient temperature using fe nn bfs 2 g for one column packed in fixed bed columns 12 mm in diameter and 100 mm in length fig s1 as v or as iii spiked natural groundwater containing as 275 μg l was used as the feeding solution about 10 mm thick of quartz wool was used at each end of the column to distribute the flow the effective bed volume bv of one column was 9 04 ml a peristaltic pump was used to maintain an upward flow in the column and 0 1 m naoh solution ph 13 was used as the eluting agent for as desorption the empty bed contact time ebct was set as 4 min and the flow rate was 2 26 ml min 2 6 kinetics and isotherms models the pseudo first order eq 1 and the pseudo second order eq 2 models are as follows 1 q t q e 1 exp k 1 t 2 q t q e 1 1 1 q e k 2 t where q e and q t mg g are

f and n are the freundlich adsorption constants 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations of fe nn bfs fig 1 a illustrates the sem images of the biochar fibers bfs the bfs showed a twisted morphology and an average diameter of approximate 5 μm the generated biochar fibers were very light and a bunch of fibers could well stand on the leaves of asparagus inset fig 1a the surface of the bare bfs was smooth fig 1b after the growth of fe nns during the hydrothermal reaction the surface morphology of fe nns changed significantly as compared to the original bfs and highly dense iron oxide nanoneedles were uniformly grown onto the surface of biochar fibers fig 1c the average density of the fe nn bfs mass is about 64 mg cm 3 inset fig 1c the magnified view of fe nn bfs showed that the nanoneedle arrays radially outward around the surface of the biochar fibers fig 1d the iron oxide nanoneedles had a diameter of 80 nm and a length of 500 nm fig 1e eds was performed to identify the element compositions of fe nn bfs fig s2 c was derived from bfs whereas fe o and cl were assigned to akaganeite the cu and s were from the copper grid and residual sulfate ions respectively xps survey spectra confirmed the presence of c fe o and cl fig s3 a high resolution tem hrtem image of the nanoneedles showed the characteristic akaganeite 21 1 plane with the d spacing of 0 2555 nm inset fig 1e the xrd patterns further confirmed that these nanoneedles were made of akaganeite fe8o8 oh 8cl1 35 β feooh pdf no 80 1770 and the clear diffraction peaks indicated that the akaganeite has a relatively good crystalline fig 1f the brunauer emmett teller bet surface area increased from 2 45 m2 g for bfs to 8 68 m2 g for fe nn bfs the content of fe in fe nn bfs was determined to be 8 6 wt from icp oes analysis furthermore fe nn bfs were highly hydrophilic with a contact angle of 0 while bfs had a high contact angle of 58 36 fig s4 the result indicated that water could quickly permeate fe nn bfs packed column with a low pressure drop 3 2 as removal kinetics the kinetics of as v and as iii removal by bfs fe nn bfs and fe nns are shown in fig 2 the bare bfs showed no adsorption of as v and as iii suggesting that the adsorption of as onto fe nn bfs was attributable to fe nns the adsorptions of both as v and as iii onto fe nn bfs were very rapid especially for as v all 100 as v c 0 911 μg l was removed within 10 min using 2 g l adsorbent and within 15 min using 1 g l adsorbent using 0 5 g l adsorbent removed 100 as v in 120 min in addition the adsorption equilibrium of as iii c 0 911 μg l was reached in approximately 60 min using 2 g l adsorbent and 240 min using 0 5 g l adsorbent the time to equilibrium for this material was considerably faster than that for other fe based biochar adsorbents where the equilibrium times were longer than 24 h wang et al 2015a 2015b the fast adsorption of as was ascribed to the short diffusion distance and the high accessibility of adsorption sites liu et al 2014 2019 yang et al 2019 certainly immobilizing nanoparticles on the support would consume available nanoparticles surface area peter et al 2017 savina et al 2011 a three fold reduction in adsorption capacity was observed when loading the free α fe2o3 and fe3o4 nanoparticles on macroporous polymer savina et al 2011 impressively 2 g l fe nn bfs performed higher as v adsorption than 0 27 g l freely dispersed fe nns normalized to 2 g l fe nn bfs and nearly equivalent as iii adsorption compared to freely dispersed fe nns the structure of the exhausted fe nn bfs after regeneration by 0 1 m naoh was characterized using sem fig s5 as observed the fiber surface was still covered by high density iron oxide nanoneedles which is similar to the structure of the virgin fe nn bfs fig 1c suggesting that the fe nn bfs have a good structural stability the kinetics data of as v and as iii adsorption by fe nn bfs were fitted to pseudo first order and pseudo second order models the fitting kinetics parameters are summarized in table s2 the adsorption was well described by the pseudo second order kinetic model indicating that the adsorption process might be a chemisorption zhang et al 2013 higher k for as v adsorption suggests that the removal effect of fe nn bfs on as v was faster than on as iii it is possibly because the adsorption energy of as v is different from that of as iii luo et al 2016 when as v or as iii was adsorbed on iron oxide minerals the adsorption complexes formed are different because as v is negatively charged and its molecular volume is larger than as iii farquhar et al 2002 guo et al 2007 liu et al 2015 resulting in different adsorption energy farrell and chaudhary 2013 3 3 as adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms can provide insight into the adsorptive performance of adsorbents toward as fig 3 showed the isotherms of as v and as iii adsorption on fe nn bfs considering that as was hardly adsorbed on bfs the adsorption capacity of fe nn bfs was normalized to the mass of fe the as in the low concentration range could be effectively removed by fe nn bfs it is very meaningful for its practical applications because the concentration of as in most of the as contaminated waters does not exceed 1 5 mg l smedley and kinniburgh 2002 both langmuir and freundlich models were used to describe the adsorption isotherms the adsorption constants are listed in table s3 the obtained correlation coefficients r 2 for the langmuir model were higher than those for the freundlich model indicative of a monomolecular layer adsorption on fe nn bfs luo et al 2019 the maximal adsorption capacities for as v and as iii from the langmuir model were 93 94 and 70 22 mg g fe respectively the normalized maximum adsorption capacities of fe nn bfs were higher than those of other iron oxide biochar based adsorbents table s4 demonstrating the high fe utilization of fe nn bfs 3 4 effect of solution chemistry the influence of ionic strength on as adsorption was investigated as shown in fig s6 the ionic strength had a negligible effect on the adsorption of as v and as iii this result indicated that the adsorption of as v and as iii onto fe nn bfs followed the inner sphere complex mechanism because nonspecifically adsorbed ions are more sensitive to changes in ionic strength than specifically adsorbed ions stumm 1992 the ph in solution can impact adsorbate states and the surface charges of adsorbents the effect of ph on the removal of as v and as iii by fe nn bfs is shown in fig 4 a the as v adsorption on fe nn bfs was maintained at above 99 at ph values below 9 when the ph was increased to 10 the removal percentage decreased to 77 the point of zero charge phpzc of fe nn bfs was 3 7 fig s7 so the surface was negatively charged in the studied ph range 4 10 thus physical absorption would be inhibited by the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged adsorbent and as v anions h2aso4 and haso4 2 and the adsorption of as v is mainly attributed to chemical adsorption shan and tong 2013 the as iii adsorption gradually increased with increasing ph and reached a maximum at ph 9 the dominant form of as iii in the ph range from 4 to 9 2 is h3aso3 therefore as iii was adsorbed onto fe nn bfs through a surface complexation mechanism rather than electrostatic interactions a proton originally associated with oxygen at the feooh surface would be released when an as o fe bond formed an increase in ph favored the association between as iii and feooh enhancing as adsorption liu et al 2008 manning et al 1998 as the ph increased above 9 2 as iii gradually became negatively charged h2aso3 and the electrostatic repulsion between as iii and the negatively charged surface became stronger causing a decrease in as iii adsorption considering the complex chemistry of natural groundwater the effect of humic acid and some ubiquitous ions on as removal was examined as shown in fig 4b humic acid had no obvious effect on the as v and as iii adsorption this favorable properties against humic acid is possibly due to the surface of the adsorbent being negatively charged at ph 7 which does not favor the adsorption of the electron rich humic acid thus the occupation of adsorption sites on the adsorbent by humic acid was very limited the effects of coexisting ions on the removal of as by fe nn bfs are depicted in fig 4c and d calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sulfate so4 2 and carbonate co3 2 ions had a slightly negative effect on as v and as iii removal in the studied concentration ranges stachowicz et al have reported that calcium magnesium and carbonate have no significant effect on as adsorption even though they form inner sphere complexation with α feooh stachowicz et al 2008 it is because their affinity was considerably lower than as brechbühl et al 2012 stachowicz et al 2007 2008 radu et al also found that even very high concentration of bicarbonate 3 6 mm inhibited the as removal slightly radu et al 2005 the sulfate usually forms out sphere complexation with ferric hydr oxides at ph 6 lefèvre 2004 rather than forming more firmly bonded inner sphere complexation therefore the sulfate suppressed as uptake slightly in contrast silicate and phosphate hindered the adsorption of as v and as iii and the inhibition increases with increasing their concentration especially at high concentration of phosphate it is because they could also form firmly bonded inner sphere complexation with metal oxides like as khare et al 2005 luxton et al 2008 in particular phosphate shared considerable chemical similarity with as arai and sparks 2001 so silicate and phosphate will compete with as for adsorption sites especially phosphate resulting in reduced the uptake of as typical silicate and phosphate concentration in groundwater are 0 45 15 mg l meng et al 2000 and 0 02 0 6 mg l roberts et al 2004 respectively the removal efficiency could be enhanced by appropriately increasing the fe nn bfs dosage 3 5 xps analysis the chemical composition of fe nn bfs before and after as adsorption was determined by xps new as 3d peaks appeared in the full survey of xps spectra after the adsorption of as v or as iii fig s8 demonstrating the adsorption of as onto fe nn bfs fig 5 a showed the as3d core levels of as v and as iii adsorbed on fe nn bfs the binding energies of the as 3d core levels of as v and as iii in as oxides were 45 9 46 3 ev and 44 7 45 2 ev respectively wanger et al 1979 the binding energy of as v remained unchangeable during adsorption in contrast the as 3d peak of adsorbed as iii could be fitted by two peaks one at 46 1 ev for as v and the other at 44 7 ev for as iii this result indicated that some of as iii was oxidized to as v during adsorption similar result was observed for the partly oxidation of as iii to as v on the ferrihydrite surface in the presence of oxygen in which ferrihydrite acted as the catalyst zhao et al 2011 to study the effect of dissolved oxygen we performed as iii adsorption experiments under anaerobic condition fig s9 without dissolved oxygen the oxidation of as iii was greatly suppressed the result indicated the dissolved oxygen functioned as the as iii oxidant when iron oxide was present jang et al proposed that the formation of complexation is required for as iii oxidation jang and dempsey 2008 the oxidation process could be proposed the as iii was first adsorbed on the iron oxide to form a as iii surface complex and then reacted with the dissolved oxygen and the as iii surface complex was converted into as v surface complex note that in anaerobic conditions traces of as iii oxidation may be attributed to oxygen containing functional groups on the biochar fibers the surface interactions between as and fe nn bfs were investigated by analyzing the o 1s xps patterns of fe nn bfs before and after as v or as iii adsorption fig 5b peaks at 529 8 531 4 and 532 5 ev represent the o in the lattice m o o in hydroxyl groups m oh and o in adsorbed h2o respectively liu et al 2016 the ratio of om oh to om o decreased from 0 96 to 0 87 and 0 88 after the adsorption of as v and as iii respectively these results indicated that the fe oh should be involved in the as adsorption with the formation of fe o as bonds further confirming that the adsorption followed the inner sphere complex mechanism 3 6 as removal from natural groundwater as removal by fe nn bfs was performed in as spiked natural groundwater sampling in a well c 0 275 μg l fig 6 for as v spiked natural groundwater 97 1 as v was removed in only 5 min using 1 g l fe nn bfs and the residual as v was 7 95 μg l for as iii spiked natural groundwater 90 as iii was removed within 120 min using 1 g l fe nn bfs and the as iii concentration decreased to 27 33 μg l the equilibrium as concentration in the treated water samples could be further reduced by appropriately increasing the dosage of fe nn bfs inset fig 6 the residual as iii concentration could be reduced to 1 22 μg l within 30 min using 1 5 g l fe nn bfs the residual as iii concentration dropped to 5 31 μg l in 15 min when increasing the adsorbent dose to 2 0 g l it was agreed well with the as iii removal kinetics results these results demonstrated that the fe nn bfs adsorbent had a highly practical application for as removal form natural groundwater 3 7 regeneration reuse and column operation of fe nn bfs reusability is an important criterion for evaluating the practicality of adsorbents conventional batch experiments are usually used for evaluating the reusability column operation is more suitable for practical applications column experiments were conducted to remove as v and as iii from as spiked groundwater fig 7 a and b showed the breakthrough curves of fe nn bfs adsorbing as v and as iii c 0 275 μg l using one column respectively at an ebct of 4 0 min the effective treatment volume was 1350 bed volumes bv 12 2 l for as v and 350 bv 3 16 l for as iii in the first cycle when the breakthrough point was set to 10 μg l the batch experiments described above showed the faster adsorption kinetics and larger adsorption capacity for as v than that for as iii by fe nn bfs the column experiment results accorded well with the adsorption kinetics and isotherm study the exhausted fe nn bfs column was easily regenerated by 0 1 m naoh solution ph 13 in total 95 as v and 92 as iii could be eluted with only 20 bv 180 8 ml of eluent fig s10 the effective treatment volume of the fe nn bfs column for as decreased as the number of regeneration cycle increased however the decrease was not significant and the effective treatment volumes for as v and as iii in the fifth cycle were still 1210 bv and 270 bv respectively the recycle performances of fe nn bfs column for as v and as iii removal were much better than the values reported in the studies using gfh which maintained less than 50 performance in the fourth regeneration thirunavukkarasu et al 2003 additionally the iron released from the column was below 0 05 mg l indicative of a good stability of fe nn bfs the potential performance of fe nn bfs in practical applications was further evaluated by using two columns in tandem to treat as spiked groundwater the breakthrough curves for as v and as iii are depicted in fig 7c the effective treatment volume reached 2900 bv for as v which was 2 15 times higher than that of a single column for as v attractively the effective treatment volume reached 2500 bv for as iii which was 7 14 times not the linear value of 2 times higher than that for single column obviously two column operation allowed a more efficient utilization of adsorption sites in the first column and longer ebct fig s11 guo and chen 2005 it is because the first adsorption column would continue to adsorb as as long as the second adsorption column was breakthrough of 10 μg l or the first adsorption completely breakthrough the column as adsorption density q column at the breakthrough point of 10 μg l was 1 80 and 1 55 mg g fe nn bfs for as v and as iii respectively the q column was comparable to that of commercially available adsorbents such as gfh and bayoxide e33 badruzzaman and westerhoff 2006 the single column experiment was also performed for treatment of as spiked natural groundwater containing both as v and as iii as v 25 μg l and as iii 25 μg l the pressure drop as a function of the treatment volume of the column was measured results are shown in fig 7d the breakthrough of 10 μg l occurred at 11000 bv experiencing a continuous operation for a month the treatment bed volume and the corresponding q column are attractive compared to these previously reported similar processes using other fe modified biochar activated carbon adsorbents table s5 in addition the pressure drop was increased slowly as the treatment volume increased after 9000 bv treatment volume the pressure drop was only 40 kpa moreover the pressure drop was reduced to the original level when the quartz wool was replaced at the bottom of the column this result suggested that the increase in pressure drop may be due to the silt blocking of the adsorbent only at the bottom rather than the crumbling of adsorbent structural stability is a desired characteristic for adsorbents in column process especially when it experiences prolonged use jang et al 2008 the fe nn bfs adsorbent showed a lower headloss pressure compared to the reported gfh theis et al 1992 the headloss pressure of gfh packed column rose quickly due to the crumbling of gfh and it became more serious after backwashing selvin et al 2000 the exhausted fe nn bfs at the bottom and top of the column were analyzed using sem fig s12 some solids were wrapped around the surface of the bottom sample the main components of the solid are silica and organic matter fig s13 this phenomenon did not occur in the top sample thus the contamination of the sample was the reason for the occurrence of headloss pressure in practical applications the contamination of the adsorbent could be effectively reduced by periodically replacing the quartz wool at the bottom attractively the iron oxide nanoneedles were still well fixed to the surface of the biochar fiber and the biochar fiber not disintegrated regardless of the bottom or top sample suggesting that fe nn bfs could withstand long term use for removal of as from groundwater 4 conclusions it is always desirable to develop economically viable and highly efficient adsorbents for as removal from groundwater a novel fe nn bfs was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal reaction without any organic reagent the iron oxide nanoneedles well ordered fixed on the surface of biochar fibers the prepared fe nn bfs showed high fe utilization and fast adsorption rate the maximal adsorption capacities for as v and as iii are 93 94 and 70 22 mg g fe at ph 7 0 its adsorption rate for as is much faster than most iron oxide modified biochar materials it could effectively remove as contamination in natural groundwater the fe nn bfs is efficiently applied to bed columns for the treatment of as contaminated groundwater the satisfactory recycle performance of fe nn bfs might reduce operating costs due to the highly hydrophilic nature and interconnected pore structure of fe nn bfs packed column the column exhibits good hydraulic characteristics during the long term application the cost of fe nns bff is approximately us 5 14 103 t much lower than reported carbon materials see supporting information in

18436,nutrients removal and recovery from surface water are attracting wide attention as nutrients contamination can cause eutrophication even threaten human health in this study a novel in situ photomicrobial nutrient recovery cell pnrc was developed which employed the self generated electric field to drive nutrient ions to migrate and subsequent recovery as microalgae biomass at an external resistance of 200 ω the current density of the pnrc reactor reached 2 0 a m 2 more than 92 of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and total phosphorus tp were separated from eutrophic water which represented 0 19 mg l 1 of nh4 n 0 23 mg l 1 of no3 n 0 02 mg l 1 of tp were left in the eutrophic water effluent meanwhile these separated nh4 n no3 n and tp were highly enriched in the cathode and anode chambers and further removed from the system with the removal efficiencies of 91 8 90 6 and 94 4 the analysis of microbial communities unraveled that high nitrate removal was attributed to the abundant denitrifying bacteria thauera paracoccus stappia and azoarcus the removal of ammonia was attributed to the algae assimilation 69 3 and nitrification process 22 5 and the phosphorus removal was mainly attributed to c vulgaris the preliminary energy balance analysis indicated that the electricity generation and biodiesel production could achieve energy neutrality theoretically

bioelectrochemical system bes eutrophic water nutrients removal chlorella vulgaris 1 introduction in recent years the presence of elevated levels of inorganic nutrients particularly nitrogen and phosphorus in surface water due to excessive agricultural industrial production and uncontrolled wastewater discharges has become an utmost concern of populations as it leads to eutrophication of aquatic systems even serious threats to human health bricker et al 2018 sinha et al 2017 wilson et al 2018 conventional biological treatments such as activated sludge systems and anaerobic anoxic oxic processes which are known to be efficient in removing nitrogen and phosphorus from various wastewater hou et al 2018 xiao et al 2014 exhibit poor performance for surface water with low nutrient levels and not feasible for treating widely distributed surface waters in addition traditional ex situ treatment techniques usually suffer from high energy or chemical consumption lacking practicality and generating secondary pollution in situ treatment technologies have garnered particular attention for environmental compatibility low energy consumption and high operational flexibility this gives priority to the exploitation of an advanced in situ nutrients removal technology for surface water in an environmentally benign and sustainable way bioelectrochemical systems bess which can accomplish the removal of organics while simultaneously recovering energy in form of electricity hydrogen or methane has drawn extensive attention and offered new information to an entirely renewable wastewater

oxidizing organics in wastewater ping et al 2016 yuan et al 2016 the desalination function was achieved by introducing an additional chamber between the anode and cathode chamber separated by a cation

without energy input herein a self sustaining photomicrobial nutrients recovery cell pnrc capable for in situ separation and enrichment of nutrient ions and subsequent recovery as biomass from eutrophic water was proposed the pnrc system took advantage of electricity generated from organics oxidation to drive charged nutrient ions across ion exchange membranes from eutrophic water and achieve highly enrichment in the pnrc chambers utilizing the unique configuration these enriched nutrients were recovered based on the synergistic interaction between chlorella vulgaris c vulgaris and various bacteria in the system the superiority of the pnrc system was effective in situ separation and enrichment of nutrient ions in an energy efficient manner which could reduce the treatment volume and facilitate the final recovery meanwhile microalgae cultivated in the cathode would help in the in situ production of oxygen as an electron acceptor for electricity generation which avoids mechanical aeration this newly proposed strategy with advantages of high flexibility and easy scale up held huge potential for practical nutrient recovery and sustainable treatment of eutrophic water in this study a self sustaining in situ photomicrobial nutrients recovery cell was developed for enhanced nutrients enrichment and removal from eutrophic water the feasibility of the pnrc was evaluated by varying operational parameters such as external resistance and initial nutrients concentration in terms of nutrients enrichment and removal efficiency the identification of the microbial community structure of the anode and cathode was performed to explore the possible mechanisms involved in the organics and nutrients removal this work suggested a new approach to in situ efficient nutrients removal and offers the potential for cost effective eutrophic waters treatment and bioenergy production 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor construction the pnrc reactor was established by cubic shaped nonconductive polycarbonate blocks consisting of an anode chamber and a cathode chamber inside dimensions 3 cm in diameter 3 5 cm and 3 cm in length respectively an anion exchange membrane aem jam ii ting run beijing a perforated plate and a cation exchange membrane cem jcm ii ting run beijing were placed between the anode and cathode chambers the perforated plate 5 cm 5 cm 1 cm with a cylindrical chamber 3 cm in diameter employed square holes as diffusion channels of eutrophic water fig 1 a silica gel rings were inserted between membranes and chambers to prevent leakage a carbon brush 3 cm diameter 3 cm length was used as the anode and a carbon cloth with 5 cm2 projected surface area coated with pt 0 5 mg cm 2 as the cathode he et al 2014 the electrodes were connected by copper wires to an external resistor of 200 ω unless otherwise specified the liquid volume of the anode or cathode chamber was 20 ml the cathode chambers were illuminated by 15 w fluorescent lamps and installed 5 cm away from the reactors 2 2 inoculation and operation before installation carbon brush anodes were pre acclimated in single chamber mfcs using domestic wastewater wenchang wastewater treatment plant harbin china the microalgae chlorella vulgaris was obtained from freshwater algae culture collection institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences china and cultured in bg11 medium li et al 2016 the composition of bg11 was shown in the table s1 before being added to the cathode chamber c vulgaris was collected by centrifuging 10000 g and diluted 3 times by di water to remove residual nutrients zhang et al 2011 the initial concentration of c vulgaris was estimated by optical density od at 658 nm od 658 of 0 85 0 05 the anode feed solution was a synthetic solution

eutrophic water the synthetic water contained 20 3 mg l 1 cod 3 2 0 1 mg l 1 nh4 n 3 1 0 1 mg l 1 no3 n 0 63 0 02 mg l 1 po4 3 p with c n ratio of 3 conductivity of 900 20 μs cm 1 unless otherwise specified 2 3 reactor operation during operation synthetic wastewater was fed into the anode chamber which was completely sealed to create an anaerobic circumstance the anode effluent mixed with c vulgaris concentrate was introduced to the cathode for the next cycle the whole reactor was submerged in a rectangular tank fed with 200 ml of eutrophic water fig 1 the eutrophic water and all the chambers of the system were refilled when the voltage was lower than 10 mv resulting in a single batch cycle three controls were used to evaluate the effect of c vulgaris on system performance the first was operation without the addition of c vulgaris denoted as no c vulgaris the second was an operation with c vulgaris but without illumination denoted as c vulgaris dark and the third was operation without c vulgaris but with mechanical aeration in the cathode denoted as air aeration all the experiments were carried out in duplicate at the stationary temperature 25 2 c to avoid the influence of temperature on the system performance 2 4 measurement and analysis the voltage u across the external resistance r was automatically monitored with 30 min intervals using a data

cathode 5 cm2 saturated calomel electrodes sce 0 242 v vs standard hydrogen electrode leici co ltd china were inserted into the anode chambers as the reference electrodes polarization curves were

spectrophotometer hach co loveland co usa nitrogen ammonium nh4 n nitrates no3 n and nitrites no2 n and phosphorus were measured according to the standard methods issued by the chinese environment

centrifuge tubes genomic dna was extracted using the bacteria dna mini kit watson biotechnologies inc shanghai according to the instructions of the manufacturer the hypervariable v3 v4 region was amplified with the universal bacterial primers pairs of 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc the final pcr products were subsequently purified quantified and sequenced on a miseq illumina sequencing platform by sangon biotech company shanghai china 3 results and discussion 3 1 electricity and power generation of the system the current output performance of the system under different conditions was monitored as shown in fig 2 a the current density of the pnrc reactor reached the maximum level 2 0 a m 2 which was 43 higher than that with air aeration 1 4 a m 2 the discrepancy between these two operations might demonstrate the superiority of aeration by microalgae than that by mechanical aeration obviously almost no electricity was produced without the addition of c vulgaris in the cathode compartment no c vulgaris meanwhile a sharp decrease in current occurred during the dark period c vulgaris dark which could be attributed to the lack of light for photosynthetic activity polarization test was performed to evaluate the bioelectrochemical activity the maximum power density and current density of the system increased from 184 9 to 472 3 mw m 2 and 0 86 to 2 34 ma m 2 when the operation changed from mechanical aeration to the pnrc reactor with c vulgaris fig 2b in contrast the maximum power density of the system without the addition of c vulgaris was 44 1 mw m 2 slightly lower than that of the system operation with c vulgaris under dark condition 53 4 mw m 2 the relatively low power densities one tenth to that of pnrc should ascribe to the insufficiency of dissolved oxygen in the cathode further convinced by the do concentration in the cathode fig 3 concomitant with power density the cathode potentials of all the systems varied much more than the anode potentials fig 2c indicating that the cathode rather than anode was determining the performance of the whole system the statistics above demonstrated the dependency of system performance on the cathodes as the anodes were identical whereas the cathode performance may depend on the dissolved oxygen concentration of the catholyte 3 2 do concentration in the cathode to verify the advantages of pnrc reactor on oxygen supply the do concentration in the cathode of different systems was investigated fig 3 in the beginning do concentration increased rapidly and reached 30 mg l 1 in the catholyte of pnrc with c vulgaris under illumination 3 6 times higher than that of the system with air aeration 6 5 mg l 1 implying that c vulgaris could release sufficient oxygen to the cathode through photosynthesis the do concentration 30 mg l 1 in the cathode of pnrc was supersaturated consistent with previous reports colombo et al 2017 xiao et al 2012 in contrast the photosynthetic activity of c vulgaris ceased under dark conditions resulting in a low do concentration prior studies had reported the influence of light on phototrophic bess and demonstrated low to no power production during the dark phase for microalgae even in the optimal medium commault et al 2017 saba et al 2017 sukačová et al 2015 although oxygen in the air could be dissolved in the catholyte and contributed to electricity generation this contribution was much smaller compared with the algae produced oxygen proved by the low do concentration in the control operation without c vulgaris current density curves and do concentration exhibited a similar trend with varying operating conditions implying do levels was crucial for the electricity generation performance 3 3 nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment and removal performance to investigate the nutrients migration and enrichment performance the concentrations of ammonium nitrate and total phosphorus in the eutrophic water as a function of time were monitored fig 4 in the pnrc systems with c vulgaris the concentration of nh4 n in the eutrophic water decreased from 3 32 0 11 mg l 1 to 0 19 0 08 mg l 1 representing 94 4 2 2 removal in a batch cycle meanwhile no3 n decreased from initial 3 16 0 11 to 0 23 0 09 mg l 1 corresponding to 92 7 2 5 removal only 0 02 0 02 mg l 1 of phosphorus was detected at the end of the operation resulting in removal efficiency of 96 9 1 6 the decrease of nutrient concentrations in the eutrophic water should be the consequence of ions migration which was separated from eutrophic water and migrated into respective pnrc chambers driven by the self generated electric field these separated nutrients were highly enriched in pnrc chambers specifically negatively charged nitrate and phosphate ions were enriched in the anodic chamber while positively charged ammonia ions were enriched in the cathodic chamber the concentration variations of nutrient ions directly demonstrated the system capability for fast separation and high enrichment of nutrient ions from eutrophic water when mechanical aeration was employed at the cathode of the system the ammonia nitrate and phosphorus removal efficiencies were only 74 8 2 9 66 8 1 7 and 77 8 1 7 respectively therefore c vulgaris could be a potentially advantageous oxygen supplier for the proposed system in terms of the current generation and nutrients removal performance in the control reactor without addition of c vulgaris nutrient concentrations in the eutrophic water decreased only slightly 12 similar to the operation with c vulgaris under dark conditions 19 implying that ion exchange made less contribution to the transportation of nutrient ions yiran and zhen 2013 yuan et al 2017 furthermore the removal efficiency and rate of nutrient ions were in agreement with the current levels indicating that the self generated electrical field was the main driving force for ions transportation from the eutrophic water ye et al 2017 the above statistics showed the nutrients ions in the eutrophic water decreased substantially therefore nh4 n no3 n tp would be enriched in the cathode and anode compartments respectively according to the liquid volume ratio of eutrophic water and anode cathode 10 1 the migrated nutrient ions were highly concentrated in the internal compartment the concentrations of these nutrient ions in the anolyte and catholyte were measured simultaneously fig s1 the results demonstrated the capability of pnrc system as the concentrated nutrient ions were almost completely removed from the whole system the system performance of the total system under different operations was shown in fig 5 a 91 8 2 6 of ammonium 90 6 2 1 of nitrate and 94 4 1 2 of phosphorus were removed for the whole pnrc system with c vulgaris in the cathode while only 43 0 3 2 49 2 2 5 and 22 5 1 6 were achieved in the system with mechanical aeration the results indicated that the high do concentration in the cathode of pnrc system might have improved the circuit current and thus accelerated migration of nutrient ions into the pnrc chambers and the c vulgaris adsorption lowered the final nutrient concentrations in the cathode effluent and increased the nutrient removal efficiencies of the whole system fig s1 the contribution of high do concentration for different pathways including oxygen reduction organic oxidation nitrification and denitrification was illustrated in fig s2 the cod removal efficiency reached 94 5 2 3 in pnrc resulting in the ce of 39 9 1 8 these results clarified that the recod and ce were 1 08 and 1 19 fold of those in the system with mechanical aeration besides the ce values of the other two systems no c vulgaris and no illumination was only 24 7 and 38 8 of that in the pnrc the contribution of each chamber on c n and p removal of pnrc was further investigated fig 5b the anode removed 86 3 3 5 of cod and decreased its concentration from 364 8 mg l 1 to 50 10 mg l 1 and the residual cod was further removed during the subsequent treatment in the cathode chamber with 20 5 mg l 1 left in the final effluent which might be used by bacteria or c vulgaris the removal of nh4 n 91 8 entirely attributed to the function of the cathode as the nh4 was driven to the cathode chamber the removal of nh4 n could be presumably attributed to the combined effects of c vulgaris and bacteria involved in nitrogen transformation to which the contribution of assimilation by c vulgaris and nitrification were 69 3 and 22 5 supplementary material s4 the anode and cathode chambers accounted for about 84 2 and 6 4 of the nitrate removal respectively the high nitrate removal efficiency in the anode might ascribe to denitrification process while the cathode contribution for phosphorus 76 2 should be a consequence of c vulgaris assimilation the effect of microbial community composition on nutrients removal warrants further investigation discussed in section 3 6 in short the statistics above demonstrated the capacity of pnrc system for removing cod nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneously 3 4 the effect of external resistance on the system performance electric current was the dominant force for driving nutrient ions transportation thus it was of great importance to elucidate the correlation between different current levels and recovery process by varying the external resistance after stabilization the pnrc was operated at various external resistances to evaluate its nutrients recovery performance and to optimize its operating conditions the system performance at different external resistances was shown in fig 6 all the performance parameters including renh4 ts reno3 ts rep ts recod ce and current density increased with the decreasing of external resistance when external resistance decreased from 1000 to 200 ω the ammonium nitrate and phosphorus removal efficiencies of the total system increased from 70 2 68 9 and 76 4 to 91 8 90 6 and 94 4 with average current density increased from 0 57 to 1 36 a m 2 fig 6 the cod removal efficiency reached 72 3 to 94 5 and the coulombic efficiency illustrated an increase from 21 5 to 39 9 due to the increased current production comparable to that obtained in previous bess zhang and angelidaki 2015 in light of the above results the external resistance was an important factor affecting the system performance in terms of electricity generation and nutrients removal performance and the system could with advantage be operated at lower external resistance 3 5 the effect of initial nutrients concentrations on system performance the applicability of the pnrc system was further verified with other eutrophic water influents ew ii 6 4 mg nh4 n l 1 6 4 mg no3 n l 1 1 22 mg tp l 1 ew i was used to denote previous eutrophic water influent 3 3 mg nh4 n l 1 3 2 mg no3 n l 1 0 64 mg tp l 1 as shown in table 1 with an increased initial nutrients concentration ew ii as influent the pnrc system achieved comparable removal efficiencies 91 6 2 3 of nh4 n 88 5 2 3 of no3 n and 90 1 3 3 of p when compared to those with ew i 91 8 2 6 of nh4 n 90 6 2 0 of no3 n and 94 4 1 2 of p the statistics above demonstrated that the system could maintain high water quality with low nutrients concentrations even doubling the initial nutrients concentrations of the eutrophic water however a notable increase in the nutrients concentrations of final effluent in the system with air aeration was observed when the initial concentration increased from ew i to ew ii rendering reduction of removal efficiencies of 7 4 4 5 and 39 7 for nh4 n no3 n and p respectively the statistics further proved that the pnrc systems with c vulgaris could be applied to eutrophic water with different nutrients concentrations 3 6 microbial community and removal mechanism analysis sparked by the efficacy of the pnrc system it was of great interest to characterize microbial communities in the system which was important to comprehend the mechanisms of nutrients removal following overlapping and quality control the four samples taken from pnrc a cb anode carbon brush anolyte c cc cathode carbon cloth and catholyte yielded effective sequences in the range of 33529 to 61700 table 2 it should be noted that the bacterial coverage value of each sample was well above 0 99 suggesting exhaustive inventories of these microbial communities du et al 2014 on the basis of alpha diversity analysis it was found these four samples exhibited a little different richness and diversity notably 618 a cb 611 anolyte 342 c cc and 363 catholyte otus were obtained at a sampling depth over 33000 based on a threshold of 97 as shown by the chao1 ace and shannon indexes the community richness and diversity of cathode were substantially lower than that of the anode ma et al 2013 the simple substrate might be conducive to the diversity of the anodic microbial community the rarefaction curves showed that new phylotypes would continue to merge computationally when the sampling depth increased to infinity as none of the curves tended to reach a plateau fig s3 proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes were the three predominant phyla in the four samples whose sum account for above 88 of the total bacterial sequences in the system figs s4 and 4a the dominant microbial population in the order level were rhodocyclales rhodobacterales rhizobiales along with desulfuromonadales collectively representing 51 68 of total bacterial sequences fig s5b pyrosequencing analyses of the dominant genus level could reveal more information on the consortium composition thauera was the most abundant family in anode samples with 27 3 and 20 8 of total taxa in the anode electrode and anolyte communities respectively most species of thauera had been identified as strong denitrifiers wang et al 2018 yu et al 2015 a fact responsible for the high removal efficiency of nitrate in the anode geoaklibacter was the second dominant genus of the anode electrode 20 6 fig 7 b which was affiliated to the geobacteraceae family routinely enriched in current generating anode biofilms it has been confirmed as a kind of representative anode respiring bacteria arb with the capacity for channeling electrons from the oxidation of organic substrates to solid electrodes for cell growth and maintenance marone et al 2016 besides geoaklibacter seems to prefer the biofilm habitat as its abundance decreased sharply in the anolyte 5 6 pseudomonas the major genus of pseudomonadales in the anolyte communities 10 3 was well known for the denitrification capacity gao et al 2018 it was reported that p stutzeri pcn 1 can utilize nitrate nitrite and n2o as denitrification substrates with little no and n2o emission zheng et al 2014 meanwhile pseudomonas has been demonstrated as an electroactive microorganism with mediator based eet using phenazine derivatives yuan et al 2017 besides some less dominant species like paracoccus stappia and azoarcus have been reported as denitrifying bacteria lee et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 and were regarded as significant denitrification groups in sewage treatment li et al 2017 the high abundance of denitrifying bacteria verified the hypothesis that the migrated nitrate in the anode was mainly removed through denitrification process the relative abundance of phosphorus accumulating organism as acinetobacter nguyen and rodrigues 2018 was quite low indicating that the removal of phosphorus in the anode chamber was attributed to the utilization of bacteria the genus fusibacter 4 2 in the anolyte belong to phylum firmicutes a dominant group during the treatment of industrial wastewater effective in degrading various organics velvizhi and venkata mohan 2015 furthermore the denitrification process of denitrifying bacteria also played a part in organics utilization huang et al 2018 the dominant genus identified in the cathode was affiliated with thauera paracoccus azoarcus and labrenzia paracoccus with the abundance of 19 6 and 6 8 for the cathode electrode and catholyte was known as a kind of denitrifying bacterium most of which could use nitrate as an alternative electron acceptor to oxygen with n2 gas as the final reduction product fang et al 2019 moreover a species paracoccus denitrificans isolated from activated sludge was aerobic denitrification and heterotrophic nitrification bacteria implying the potential ability for the complete transformation of ammonium to n2 gas su et al 2015 another species paracoccus versutus lym was confirmed to have the ability of heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification shi et al 2013 as stated above the genus of thauera and azoarcus were thought to be primarily responsible for denitrification pseudomonas of which some species have been reported to be capable of oxidizing nh4 to no3 roveto and schuler 2019 pseudomonas stutzeri yzn 001 was reported to be able to remove ammonium even at low temperature yao et al 2013 there was little information about the function of labrenzia the relative abundance was 13 4 and 4 1 for the cathode electrode and catholyte respectively however given the close phylogenetic relationship of labrenzia with stappia the genus labrenzia seemed to perform nitrate transformation fig 7b further investigation is needed to investigate the role in the transformation of pollutants the community composition demonstrated that ammonia was removed through the synergistic interactions among c vulgaris and nitrifying bacteria moreover the low abundance of bacteria involved in phosphorus removal confirmed the pivotal role of assimilation by c vulgaris in phosphorus removal overall the high diversity of microbial communities in the reactor especially the genus with electrochemical activity and involved in the nitrogen transformations verified the previous hypothesis recovered nutrients driven by self generated electric field was finally removed by the combined microalgae uptake and bacterial metabolic activities fig 8 nitrate was transformed to n2 gas by electrochemical denitrification while phosphorus was assimilated by the bacteria and c vulgaris the removal of ammonium in cathode was likely due to a combination of factors that included the oxidation of ammonium to nitrate and adsorption by c vulgaris in view of the functional analysis the combined microalgae and bacterial metabolic activities in the pnrc played a central role in nutrients and organics removal from eutrophic water 3 7 economic analysis a preliminary energy balance analysis including energy consumption and production was summarized in table 3 energy consumption of the pnrc system was calculated as 0 225 kwh m 3 for illumination energy production mainly contained electricity and biodiesel from microalgae the electricity generation of the pnrc was 8 27 kwh m 3 and biodiesel trapped from c vulgaris lipid was estimated based on the ebiodiesel of 37800 kj kg 1 xiao et al 2012 and lipids contents could be 30 safi et al 2014 wang et al 2019 therefore the biodiesel obtained from c vulgaris was estimated as 108 86 kj m 3 if all of the produced energy was recovered a positive energy balance could be obtained with the electricity of 7 705 kwh m 3 and biodiesel of 108 86 kj m 3 in the traditional nitrification denitrification process aeration and post treatment of excess sludge were the main part of energy consumption liu et al 2018 in general the aeration associated energy consumption with nitrification was 0 1 kwh m 3 and the electricity for sludge proposal process was 0 038 kwh m 3 while some issues e g transportation of sludge to landfill sites were not included here therefore the preliminary energy balance analysis demonstrated the economic feasibility of the pnrc system which could achieve energy self sufficient if these values could be maintained for larger scale system 4 conclusion in this study in situ nutrient enrichment and removal from eutrophic water has been accomplished by a self sustaining photomicrobial nutrients recovery cell pnrc rather than introducing eutrophic water directly to the anode cathode chamber the pnrc system made it possible for nutrient ions to be highly concentrated in the internal compartment no3 n and po4 3 p in the anode chamber nh4 n in the cathode chamber driven by the self generated electric field and recovered as microalgae biomass meanwhile the oxygen supply by photosynthesis of chlorella vulgaris in the cathode chamber could achieve higher current levels in the system thereby greatly improving the enrichment and removal of nutrient ions the capacity of pnrc system for treatment of eutrophic water with higher nutrients concentrations was further confirmed as the system presented high nutrients removal with increased initial nutrients concentrations microbial diversity analyses indicated that in addition to the uptake of chlorella vulgaris diverse bacteria particularly nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria also facilitated the removals of nutrients initial energy analysis demonstrated the system could achieve energy self sufficient which further enhanced the economic feasibility of pnrc system the results of this study have provided a proof of concept for in situ nutrients enrichment and recovery from eutrophic water via pnrc system with simultaneous electricity generation and microalgae production and will encourage further exploration of this system promoted resource recovery from wastes

18436,nutrients removal and recovery from surface water are attracting wide attention as nutrients contamination can cause eutrophication even threaten human health in this study a novel in situ photomicrobial nutrient recovery cell pnrc was developed which employed the self generated electric field to drive nutrient ions to migrate and subsequent recovery as microalgae biomass at an external resistance of 200 ω the current density of the pnrc reactor reached 2 0 a m 2 more than 92 of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and total phosphorus tp were separated from eutrophic water which represented 0 19 mg l 1 of nh4 n 0 23 mg l 1 of no3 n 0 02 mg l 1 of tp were left in the eutrophic water effluent meanwhile these separated nh4 n no3 n and tp were highly enriched in the cathode and anode chambers and further removed from the system with the removal efficiencies of 91 8 90 6 and 94 4 the analysis of microbial communities unraveled that high nitrate removal was attributed to the abundant denitrifying bacteria thauera paracoccus stappia and azoarcus the removal of ammonia was attributed to the algae assimilation 69 3 and nitrification process 22 5 and the phosphorus removal was mainly attributed to c vulgaris the preliminary energy balance analysis indicated that the electricity generation and biodiesel production could achieve energy neutrality theoretically further demonstrating the huge potential of the pnrc system in cost effective nutrients recovery from eutrophic water graphical abstract image 1 keywords photomicrobial nutrients recovery cell pnrc bioelectrochemical system bes eutrophic water nutrients removal chlorella vulgaris 1 introduction in recent years the presence of elevated levels of inorganic nutrients particularly nitrogen and phosphorus in surface water due to excessive agricultural industrial production and uncontrolled wastewater discharges has become an utmost concern of populations as it leads to eutrophication of aquatic systems even serious threats to human health bricker et al 2018 sinha et al 2017 wilson et al 2018 conventional biological treatments such as activated sludge systems and anaerobic anoxic oxic processes which are known to be efficient in removing nitrogen and phosphorus from various wastewater hou et al 2018 xiao et al 2014 exhibit poor performance for surface water with low nutrient levels and not feasible for treating widely distributed surface waters in addition traditional ex situ treatment techniques usually suffer from high energy or chemical consumption lacking practicality and generating secondary pollution in situ treatment technologies have garnered particular attention for environmental compatibility low energy consumption and high operational flexibility this gives priority to the exploitation of an advanced in situ nutrients removal technology for surface water in an environmentally benign and sustainable way bioelectrochemical systems bess which can accomplish the removal of organics while simultaneously recovering energy in form of electricity hydrogen or methane has drawn extensive attention and offered new information to an entirely renewable wastewater treatment concept li et al 2014 liu et al 2014 logan and rabaey 2012 one of the bes microbial desalination cell mdc exhibits great promise for desalination through deriving biochemical energy from oxidizing organics in wastewater ping et al 2016 yuan et al 2016 the desalination function was achieved by introducing an additional chamber between the anode and cathode chamber separated by a cation exchange membrane and an anion exchange membrane and utilizing difference of the electrode redox potential to deploy the migration of anions i e chlorine and cations i e sodium towards the anode and cathode chamber respectively chen et al 2016 during the past few years mdcs have demonstrated with versatile applications to remove or recover ionic substances from various impaired waters among which mdc for nutrients recovery has drawn wide attention chen et al 2017 hou et al 2017 qin et al 2018 a novel mdc namely microbial nutrient recovery cell mnrc was recently developed to recover nutrients in domestic water chen et al 2015 in situ treatment for nitrate containing groundwater was achieved by a submerged microbial desalination denitrification cell zhang and angelidaki 2013 therefore mdcs

without energy input herein a self sustaining photomicrobial nutrients recovery cell pnrc capable for in situ separation and enrichment of nutrient ions and subsequent recovery as biomass from eutrophic water was proposed the pnrc system took advantage of electricity generated from organics oxidation to drive charged nutrient ions across ion exchange membranes from eutrophic water and achieve highly enrichment in the pnrc chambers utilizing the unique configuration these enriched nutrients were recovered based on the synergistic interaction between chlorella vulgaris c vulgaris and various bacteria in the system the superiority of the pnrc system was effective in situ separation and enrichment of nutrient ions in an energy efficient manner which could reduce the treatment volume and facilitate the final recovery meanwhile microalgae cultivated in the cathode would help in the in situ production of oxygen as an electron acceptor for electricity generation which avoids mechanical aeration this newly proposed strategy with advantages of high flexibility and easy scale up held huge potential for practical nutrient recovery and sustainable treatment of eutrophic water in this study a self sustaining in situ photomicrobial nutrients recovery cell was developed for enhanced nutrients enrichment and removal from eutrophic water the feasibility of the pnrc was evaluated by varying operational parameters such as external resistance and initial nutrients concentration in terms of nutrients enrichment and removal efficiency the identification of the microbial community structure of the anode and cathode was performed to explore the possible mechanisms involved in the organics and nutrients removal this work suggested a new approach to in situ efficient nutrients removal and offers the potential for cost effective eutrophic waters treatment and bioenergy production 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor construction the pnrc reactor was established by cubic shaped nonconductive polycarbonate blocks consisting of an anode chamber and a cathode chamber inside dimensions 3 cm in diameter 3 5 cm and 3 cm in length respectively an anion exchange membrane aem jam ii ting run beijing a perforated plate and a cation exchange membrane cem jcm ii ting run beijing were placed between the anode and cathode chambers the perforated plate 5 cm 5 cm 1 cm with a cylindrical chamber 3 cm in diameter employed square holes as diffusion channels of eutrophic water fig 1 a silica gel rings were inserted between membranes and chambers to prevent leakage a carbon brush 3 cm diameter 3 cm length was used as the anode and a carbon cloth with 5 cm2 projected surface area coated with pt 0 5 mg cm 2 as the cathode he et al 2014 the electrodes were connected by copper wires to an external resistor of 200 ω unless otherwise specified the liquid volume of the anode or cathode chamber was 20 ml the cathode chambers were illuminated by 15 w fluorescent lamps and installed 5 cm away from the reactors 2 2 inoculation and operation before installation carbon brush anodes were pre acclimated in single chamber mfcs using domestic wastewater wenchang wastewater treatment plant harbin china the microalgae chlorella vulgaris was obtained from freshwater algae culture collection institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences china and cultured in bg11 medium li et al 2016 the composition of bg11 was shown in the table s1 before being added to the cathode chamber c vulgaris was collected by centrifuging 10000 g and diluted 3 times by di water to remove residual nutrients zhang et al 2011 the initial concentration of c vulgaris was estimated by optical density od at 658 nm od 658 of 0 85 0 05 the anode feed solution was a synthetic solution

eutrophic water the synthetic water contained 20 3 mg l 1 cod 3 2 0 1 mg l 1 nh4 n 3 1 0 1 mg l 1 no3 n 0 63 0 02 mg l 1 po4 3 p with c n ratio of 3 conductivity of 900 20 μs cm 1 unless otherwise specified 2 3 reactor operation during operation synthetic wastewater was fed into the anode chamber which was completely sealed to create an anaerobic circumstance the anode effluent mixed with c vulgaris concentrate was introduced to the cathode for the next cycle the whole reactor was submerged in a rectangular tank fed with 200 ml of eutrophic water fig 1 the eutrophic water and all the chambers of the system were refilled when the voltage was lower than 10 mv resulting in a single batch cycle three controls were used to evaluate the effect of c vulgaris on system performance the first was operation without the addition of c vulgaris denoted as no c vulgaris the second was an operation with c vulgaris but without illumination denoted as c vulgaris dark and the third was operation without c vulgaris but with mechanical aeration in the cathode denoted as air aeration all the experiments were carried out in duplicate at the stationary temperature 25 2 c to avoid the influence of temperature on the system performance 2 4 measurement and analysis the voltage u across the external resistance r was automatically monitored with 30 min intervals using a data

cathode 5 cm2 saturated calomel electrodes sce 0 242 v vs standard hydrogen electrode leici co ltd china were inserted into the anode chambers as the reference electrodes polarization curves were conducted with a series of external resistances from 2000 to 50 ω over 20 min and the voltages and potentials were recorded chemical oxygen demand cod was measured using the hach dr 3900 spectrophotometer hach co loveland co usa nitrogen ammonium nh4 n nitrates no3 n and nitrites no2 n and phosphorus were measured according to the standard methods issued by the chinese environment

centrifuge tubes genomic dna was extracted using the bacteria dna mini kit watson biotechnologies inc shanghai according to the instructions of the manufacturer the hypervariable v3 v4 region was amplified with the universal bacterial primers pairs of 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc the final pcr products were subsequently purified quantified and sequenced on a miseq illumina sequencing platform by sangon biotech company shanghai china 3 results and discussion 3 1 electricity and power generation of the system the current output performance of the system under different conditions was monitored as shown in fig 2 a the current density of the pnrc reactor reached the maximum level 2 0 a m 2 which was 43 higher than that with air aeration 1 4 a m 2 the discrepancy between these two operations might demonstrate the superiority of aeration by microalgae than that by mechanical aeration obviously almost no electricity was produced without the addition of c vulgaris in the cathode compartment no c vulgaris meanwhile a sharp decrease in current occurred during the dark period c vulgaris dark which could be attributed to the lack of light for photosynthetic activity polarization test was performed to evaluate the bioelectrochemical activity the maximum power density and current density of the system increased from 184 9 to 472 3 mw m 2 and 0 86 to 2 34 ma m 2 when the operation changed from mechanical aeration to the pnrc reactor with c vulgaris fig 2b in contrast the maximum power density of the system without the addition of c vulgaris was 44 1 mw m 2 slightly lower than that of the system operation with c vulgaris under dark condition 53 4 mw m 2 the relatively low power densities one tenth to that of pnrc should ascribe to the insufficiency of dissolved oxygen in the cathode further convinced by the do concentration in the cathode fig 3 concomitant with power density the cathode potentials of all the systems varied much more than the anode potentials fig 2c indicating that the cathode rather than anode was determining the performance of the whole system the statistics above demonstrated the dependency of system performance on the cathodes as the anodes were identical whereas the cathode performance may depend on the dissolved oxygen concentration of the catholyte 3 2 do concentration in the cathode to verify the advantages of pnrc reactor on oxygen supply the do concentration in the cathode of different systems was investigated fig 3 in the beginning do concentration increased rapidly and reached 30 mg l 1 in the catholyte of pnrc with c vulgaris under illumination 3 6 times higher than that of the system with air aeration 6 5 mg l 1 implying that c vulgaris could release sufficient oxygen to the cathode through photosynthesis the do concentration 30 mg l 1 in the cathode of pnrc was supersaturated consistent with previous reports colombo et al 2017 xiao et al 2012 in contrast the photosynthetic activity of c vulgaris ceased under dark conditions resulting in a low do concentration prior studies had reported the influence of light on phototrophic bess and demonstrated low to no power production during the dark phase for microalgae even in the optimal medium commault et al 2017 saba et al 2017 sukačová et al 2015 although oxygen in the air could be dissolved in the catholyte and contributed to electricity generation this contribution was much smaller compared with the algae produced oxygen proved by the low do concentration in the control operation without c vulgaris current density curves and do concentration exhibited a similar trend with varying operating conditions implying do levels was crucial for the electricity generation performance 3 3 nitrogen and phosphorus enrichment and removal performance to investigate the nutrients migration and enrichment performance the concentrations of ammonium nitrate and total phosphorus in the eutrophic water as a function of time were monitored fig 4 in the pnrc systems with c vulgaris the concentration of nh4 n in the eutrophic water decreased from 3 32 0 11 mg l 1 to 0 19 0 08 mg l 1 representing 94 4 2 2 removal in a batch cycle meanwhile no3 n decreased from initial 3 16 0 11 to 0 23 0 09 mg l 1 corresponding to 92 7 2 5 removal only 0 02 0 02 mg l 1 of phosphorus was detected at the end of the operation resulting in removal efficiency of 96 9 1 6 the decrease of nutrient concentrations in the eutrophic water should be the consequence of ions migration which was separated from eutrophic water and migrated into respective pnrc chambers driven by the self generated electric field these separated nutrients were highly enriched in pnrc chambers specifically negatively charged nitrate and phosphate ions were enriched in the anodic chamber while positively charged ammonia ions were enriched in the cathodic chamber the concentration variations of nutrient ions directly demonstrated the system capability for fast separation and high enrichment of nutrient ions from eutrophic water when mechanical aeration was employed at the cathode of the system the ammonia nitrate and phosphorus removal efficiencies were only 74 8 2 9 66 8 1 7 and 77 8 1 7 respectively therefore c vulgaris could be a potentially advantageous oxygen supplier for the proposed system in terms of the current generation and nutrients removal performance in the control reactor without addition of c vulgaris nutrient concentrations in the eutrophic water decreased only slightly 12 similar to the operation with c vulgaris under dark conditions 19 implying that ion exchange made less contribution to the transportation of nutrient ions yiran and zhen 2013 yuan et al 2017 furthermore the removal efficiency and rate of nutrient ions were in agreement with the current levels indicating that the self generated electrical field was the main driving force for ions transportation from the eutrophic water ye et al 2017 the above statistics showed the nutrients ions in the eutrophic water decreased substantially therefore nh4 n no3 n tp would be enriched in the cathode and anode compartments respectively according to the liquid volume ratio of eutrophic water and anode cathode 10 1 the migrated nutrient ions were highly concentrated in the internal compartment the concentrations of these nutrient ions in the anolyte and catholyte were measured simultaneously fig s1 the results demonstrated the capability of pnrc system as the concentrated nutrient ions were almost completely removed from the whole system the system performance of the total system under different operations was shown in fig 5 a 91 8 2 6 of ammonium 90 6 2 1 of nitrate and 94 4 1 2 of phosphorus were removed for the whole pnrc system with c vulgaris in the cathode while only 43 0 3 2 49 2 2 5 and 22 5 1 6 were achieved in the system with mechanical aeration the results indicated that the high do concentration in the cathode of pnrc system might have improved the circuit current and thus accelerated migration of nutrient ions into the pnrc chambers and the c vulgaris adsorption lowered the final nutrient concentrations in the cathode effluent and increased the nutrient removal efficiencies of the whole system fig s1 the contribution of high do concentration for different pathways including oxygen reduction organic oxidation nitrification and denitrification was illustrated in fig s2 the cod removal efficiency reached 94 5 2 3 in pnrc resulting in the ce of 39 9 1 8 these results clarified that the recod and ce were 1 08 and 1 19 fold of those in the system with mechanical aeration besides the ce values of the other two systems no c vulgaris and no illumination was only 24 7 and 38 8 of that in the pnrc the contribution of each chamber on c n and p removal of pnrc was further investigated fig 5b the anode removed 86 3 3 5 of cod and decreased its concentration from 364 8 mg l 1 to 50 10 mg l 1 and the residual cod was further removed during the subsequent treatment in the cathode chamber with 20 5 mg l 1 left in the final effluent which might be used by bacteria or c vulgaris the removal of nh4 n 91 8 entirely attributed to the function of the cathode as the nh4 was driven to the cathode chamber the removal of nh4 n could be presumably attributed to the combined effects of c vulgaris and bacteria involved in nitrogen transformation to which the contribution of assimilation by c vulgaris and nitrification were 69 3 and 22 5 supplementary material s4 the anode and cathode chambers accounted for about 84 2 and 6 4 of the nitrate removal respectively the high nitrate removal efficiency in the anode might ascribe to denitrification process while the cathode contribution for phosphorus 76 2 should be a consequence of c vulgaris assimilation the effect of microbial community composition on nutrients removal warrants further investigation discussed in section 3 6 in short the statistics above demonstrated the capacity of pnrc system for removing cod nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneously 3 4 the effect of external resistance on the system performance electric current was the dominant force for driving nutrient ions transportation thus it was of great importance to elucidate the correlation between different current levels and recovery process by varying the external resistance after stabilization the pnrc was operated at various external resistances to evaluate its nutrients recovery performance and to optimize its operating conditions the system performance at different external resistances was shown in fig 6 all the performance parameters including renh4 ts reno3 ts rep ts recod ce and current density increased with the decreasing of external resistance when external resistance decreased from 1000 to 200 ω the ammonium nitrate and phosphorus removal efficiencies of the total system increased from 70 2 68 9 and 76 4 to 91 8 90 6 and 94 4 with average current density increased from 0 57 to 1 36 a m 2 fig 6 the cod removal efficiency reached 72 3 to 94 5 and the coulombic efficiency illustrated an increase from 21 5 to 39 9 due to the increased current production comparable to that obtained in previous bess zhang and angelidaki 2015 in light of the above results the external resistance was an important factor affecting the system performance in terms of electricity generation and nutrients removal performance and the system could with advantage be operated at lower external resistance 3 5 the effect of initial nutrients concentrations on system performance the applicability of the pnrc system was further verified with other eutrophic water influents ew ii 6 4 mg nh4 n l 1 6 4 mg no3 n l 1 1 22 mg tp l 1 ew i was used to denote previous eutrophic water influent 3 3 mg nh4 n l 1 3 2 mg no3 n l 1 0 64 mg tp l 1 as shown in table 1 with an increased initial nutrients concentration ew ii as influent the pnrc system achieved comparable removal efficiencies 91 6 2 3 of nh4 n 88 5 2 3 of no3 n and 90 1 3 3 of p when compared to those with ew i 91 8 2 6 of nh4 n 90 6 2 0 of no3 n and 94 4 1 2 of p the statistics above demonstrated that the system could maintain high water quality with low nutrients concentrations even doubling the initial nutrients concentrations of the eutrophic water however a notable increase in the nutrients concentrations of final effluent in the system with air aeration was observed when the initial concentration increased from ew i to ew ii rendering reduction of removal efficiencies of 7 4 4 5 and 39 7 for nh4 n no3 n and p respectively the statistics further proved that the pnrc systems with c vulgaris could be applied to eutrophic water with different nutrients concentrations 3 6 microbial community and removal mechanism analysis sparked by the efficacy of the pnrc system it was of great interest to characterize microbial communities in the system which was important to comprehend the mechanisms of nutrients removal following overlapping and quality control the four samples taken from pnrc a cb anode carbon brush anolyte c cc cathode carbon cloth and catholyte yielded effective sequences in the range of 33529 to 61700 table 2 it should be noted that the bacterial coverage value of each sample was well above 0 99 suggesting exhaustive inventories of these microbial communities du et al 2014 on the basis of alpha diversity analysis it was found these four samples exhibited a little different richness and diversity notably 618 a cb 611 anolyte 342 c cc and 363 catholyte otus were obtained at a sampling depth over 33000 based on a threshold of 97 as shown by the chao1 ace and shannon indexes the community richness and diversity of cathode were substantially lower than that of the anode ma et al 2013 the simple substrate might be conducive to the diversity of the anodic microbial community the rarefaction curves showed that new phylotypes would continue to merge computationally when the sampling depth increased to infinity as none of the curves tended to reach a plateau fig s3 proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes were the three predominant phyla in the four samples whose sum account for above 88 of the total bacterial sequences in the system figs s4 and 4a the dominant microbial population in the order level were rhodocyclales rhodobacterales rhizobiales along with desulfuromonadales collectively representing 51 68 of total bacterial sequences fig s5b pyrosequencing analyses of the dominant genus level could reveal more information on the consortium composition thauera was the most abundant family in anode samples with 27 3 and 20 8 of total taxa in the anode electrode and anolyte communities respectively most species of thauera had been identified as strong denitrifiers wang et al 2018 yu et al 2015 a fact responsible for the high removal efficiency of nitrate in the anode geoaklibacter was the second dominant genus of the anode electrode 20 6 fig 7 b which was affiliated to the geobacteraceae family routinely enriched in current generating anode biofilms it has been confirmed as a kind of representative anode respiring bacteria arb with the capacity for channeling electrons from the oxidation of organic substrates to solid electrodes for cell growth and maintenance marone et al 2016 besides geoaklibacter seems to prefer the biofilm habitat as its abundance decreased sharply in the anolyte 5 6 pseudomonas the major genus of pseudomonadales in the anolyte communities 10 3 was well known for the denitrification capacity gao et al 2018 it was reported that p stutzeri pcn 1 can utilize nitrate nitrite and n2o as denitrification substrates with little no and n2o emission zheng et al 2014 meanwhile pseudomonas has been demonstrated as an electroactive microorganism with mediator based eet using phenazine derivatives yuan et al 2017 besides some less dominant species like paracoccus stappia and azoarcus have been reported as denitrifying bacteria lee et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 and were regarded as significant denitrification groups in sewage treatment li et al 2017 the high abundance of denitrifying bacteria verified the hypothesis that the migrated nitrate in the anode was mainly removed through denitrification process the relative abundance of phosphorus accumulating organism as acinetobacter nguyen and rodrigues 2018 was quite low indicating that the removal of phosphorus in the anode chamber was attributed to the utilization of bacteria the genus fusibacter 4 2 in the anolyte belong to phylum firmicutes a dominant group during the treatment of industrial wastewater effective in degrading various organics velvizhi and venkata mohan 2015 furthermore the denitrification process of denitrifying bacteria also played a part in organics utilization huang et al 2018 the dominant genus identified in the cathode was affiliated with thauera paracoccus azoarcus and labrenzia paracoccus with the abundance of 19 6 and 6 8 for the cathode electrode and catholyte was known as a kind of denitrifying bacterium most of which could use nitrate as an alternative electron acceptor to oxygen with n2 gas as the final reduction product fang et al 2019 moreover a species paracoccus denitrificans isolated from activated sludge was aerobic denitrification and heterotrophic nitrification bacteria implying the potential ability for the complete transformation of ammonium to n2 gas su et al 2015 another species paracoccus versutus lym was confirmed to have the ability of heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification shi et al 2013 as stated above the genus of thauera and azoarcus were thought to be primarily responsible for denitrification pseudomonas of which some species have been reported to be capable of oxidizing nh4 to no3 roveto and schuler 2019 pseudomonas stutzeri yzn 001 was reported to be able to remove ammonium even at low temperature yao et al 2013 there was little information about the function of labrenzia the relative abundance was 13 4 and 4 1 for the cathode electrode and catholyte respectively however given the close phylogenetic relationship of labrenzia with stappia the genus labrenzia seemed to perform nitrate transformation fig 7b further investigation is needed to investigate the role in the transformation of pollutants the community composition demonstrated that ammonia was removed through the synergistic interactions among c vulgaris and nitrifying bacteria moreover the low abundance of bacteria involved in phosphorus removal confirmed the pivotal role of assimilation by c vulgaris in phosphorus removal overall the high diversity of microbial communities in the reactor especially the genus with electrochemical activity and involved in the nitrogen transformations verified the previous hypothesis recovered nutrients driven by self generated electric field was finally removed by the combined microalgae uptake and bacterial metabolic activities fig 8 nitrate was transformed to n2 gas by electrochemical denitrification while phosphorus was assimilated by the bacteria and c vulgaris the removal of ammonium in cathode was likely due to a combination of factors that included the oxidation of ammonium to nitrate and adsorption by c vulgaris in view of the functional analysis the combined microalgae and bacterial metabolic activities in the pnrc played a central role in nutrients and organics removal from eutrophic water 3 7 economic analysis a preliminary energy balance analysis including energy consumption and production was summarized in table 3 energy consumption of the pnrc system was calculated as 0 225 kwh m 3 for illumination energy production mainly contained electricity and biodiesel from microalgae the electricity generation of the pnrc was 8 27 kwh m 3 and biodiesel trapped from c vulgaris lipid was estimated based on the ebiodiesel of 37800 kj kg 1 xiao et al 2012 and lipids contents could be 30 safi et al 2014 wang et al 2019 therefore the biodiesel obtained from c vulgaris was estimated as 108 86 kj m 3 if all of the produced energy was recovered a positive energy balance could be obtained with the electricity of 7 705 kwh m 3 and biodiesel of 108 86 kj m 3 in the traditional nitrification denitrification process aeration and post treatment of excess sludge were the main part of energy consumption liu et al 2018 in general the aeration associated energy consumption with nitrification was 0 1 kwh m 3 and the electricity for sludge proposal process was 0 038 kwh m 3 while some issues e g transportation of sludge to landfill sites were not included here therefore the preliminary energy balance analysis demonstrated the economic feasibility of the pnrc system which could achieve energy self sufficient if these values could be maintained for larger scale system 4 conclusion in this study in situ nutrient enrichment and removal from eutrophic water has been accomplished by a self sustaining photomicrobial nutrients recovery cell pnrc rather than introducing eutrophic water directly to the anode cathode chamber the pnrc system made it possible for nutrient ions to be highly concentrated in the internal compartment no3 n and po4 3 p in the anode chamber nh4 n in the cathode chamber driven by the self generated electric field and recovered as microalgae biomass meanwhile the oxygen supply by photosynthesis of chlorella vulgaris in the cathode chamber could achieve higher current levels in the system thereby greatly improving the enrichment and removal of nutrient ions the capacity of pnrc system for treatment of eutrophic water with higher nutrients concentrations was further confirmed as the system presented high nutrients removal with increased initial nutrients concentrations microbial diversity analyses indicated that in addition to the uptake of chlorella vulgaris diverse bacteria particularly nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria also facilitated the removals of nutrients initial energy analysis demonstrated the system could achieve energy self sufficient which further enhanced the economic feasibility of pnrc system the results of this study have provided a proof of concept for in situ nutrients enrichment and recovery from eutrophic water via pnrc system with simultaneous electricity generation and microalgae production and will encourage further exploration of this system promoted resource recovery from wastes

18437,the novel h2o2 mno2 system was developed to achieve highly efficient membrane cleaning for both fouled pvdf and pes membranes in this study compared with conventional chemical cleaning process in which the whole membrane module had to be soaked in highly concentrated solution of chemical reagent for long period of time the h2o2 mno2 cleaning process conducting for only 5 min in 0 5 wt h2o2 solution could achieve more than 95 recovery of permeate flux and almost total removal of the irreversible foulants more importantly the permeate flux and filtration efficiency of the membrane could be still kept stable after 6 runs of consecutive fouling and cleaning based on the systematic microscopic analyses electron spin resonance esr fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir as well as the quenching experiments with different free radical scavengers the outstanding performance of h2o2 mno2 system was attributed to the generation of both free radicals and abundant oxygen simultaneously leading to the physico chemical membrane cleaning conclusively the newly developed h2o2 mno2 system demonstrated noteworthy advantages on efficient membrane cleaning and exhibited highly potential for the wide application in practical water treatment process graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane cleaning physico chemical cleaning mno2 h2o2 1 introduction during the recent decade membrane filtration technologies such as microfiltration ultrafiltration and membrane bioreactors have been drawn great attention and widely promoted for the treatment of both drinking and waste water to maintain the stable operation of the filtration process regular membrane cleaning is required to control the membrane fouling guarantee the effluent quality and keep the appropriate membrane flux bagheri and mirbagheri 2018 shi et al 2014 among various types of membrane cleaning processes the most widely utilized ones are still the conventional physical membrane cleaning and chemical membrane cleaning the physical membrane cleaning processes such as air scouring backflushing and relaxation are effective to remove the reversible fouling while the irreversible fouling can be removed by the chemical cleaning processes with the utilization of acids bases and oxidants kimura et al 2004 strugholtz et al 2005 wang et al 2014 the chemical cleaning with naclo or h2o2 as oxidants can oxidize the complicated functional groups of foulants to ketonic aldehyde or carboxyl groups wang et al 2014 through the chemical cleaning by oxidants size of the foulants will be decreased meanwhile the foulants will become less hydrophobic resulting in the weakening of adhesive force between membrane and them so it is very effective to remove the irreversible organic and biological foulants wang et al 2014 the essential step of conventional chemical cleaning is to soak the fouled membrane into the solution of cleaning reagent for severe organic fouling even dozens of hours are needed for the soaking period however problems including low mass transfer rate of the reactive components abundant dosage of cleaning reagents and the damage of membrane structure by the cleaning reagents especially oxidants are commonly existed during the chemical cleaning process porcelli and judd 2010 these problems weaken the performance of the cleaning process observably nevertheless there are still seldom effective methods to deal with them at the present the commonly utilized membrane materials such as polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polyethersulfone pes and polysulfone ps are generally highly hydrophobic so they restrain the transportation of reactive components for membrane cleaning from cleaning solution to the membrane surface and further into the membrane holes meanwhile the irreversible foulants left on the surface of membrane also block the pathway for reactive components transporting from the surface to membrane holes the effective mass transfer is especially important for the chemical cleaning with oxidants because the generation of reactive components such as free radicals occurs continuously at the expense of oxidants e g h2o2 naclo and the lifetime of them is always extremely short methods to enhance the mass transfer rate by previous studies include hydrophilization of the membrane material temperature increment of the system generation of turbulent flow by aeration and increment of the chemical dosage bagheri and mirbagheri 2018 porcelli and judd 2010 while limitations are still existed in these methods such as the enhancement of material cost due to the modification of the membrane material and the enhancement of operational cost if heating and aeration facilities are equipped to the filtration setup increment of the chemical dosage is easier to operate compared with other methods however as mentioned above structure of the membrane will be damaged through long term direct contact with the oxidative components the irreversible foulants distribute unevenly on the surface and inside of the membrane chen et al 2007 2017 kim et al 2015 while the whole membrane module has to be soaked in the chemical reagent solution during the conventional chemical cleaning process so clean parts of the membrane will contact with the oxidant directly for long time resulting in the damage of membrane structure conclusively there is still high demand to develop the new types of membrane cleaning technology with the characteristics of low energy cost high efficiency low chemical dosage and less damage to the membrane structure during the cleaning process mno2 is widely utilized in practical water treatment process due to its well performances as both adsorbent and catalyst cao et al 2011 zhang and sun 2013 meanwhile the low price of it also reduce the overall cost of water treatment process mno2 can act as photo catalyst through the semi conductor mechanism and photothermal mechanism villaseñor et al 2002 yang et al 2017 moreover it can also generate reactive free radicals to degrade pollutants through the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 he et al 2017 wani et al 2016 recent study has anchored mno2 nanoparticles on the commercial desalination membrane surfaces to eliminated colloidal and organic fouling by the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 guha et al 2017 besides mno2 effective biofouling control could also be achieved by periodic h2o2 cleaning with cuo modified spacers in membrane based desalination processes yang et al 2019 in this study the h2o2 mno2 system was developed to clean the fouled membrane for the first time the efficient generation of reactive free radicals by catalytic decomposition of h2o2 and the turbulent flow generated by the extensive production of oxygen led to the much more effective membrane cleaning compared with the conventional soaking method furthermore systematic microscopic analysis esr tests ftir tests and quenching experiments were conducted to evaluate the membrane cleaning performance and explain the related mechanisms in depth 2 material and methods 2 1 material and experimental setup the tested membrane included flat sheet polyethersulfone membrane pes molecular weight cutoff 30k da diameter 80 mm and polyvinylidene fluoride membrane pvdf molecular weight cutoff 100k da diameter 76 mm were purchased from mosu science equipment co ltd shanghai chemicals including humic acid ha h2o2 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo benzoquinone tertiary butanol and mno2 were all analytical reagent and purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china and directly used in the experiments without further purification the filtration experiments were conducted by a standard ultrafiltration module millipore 8200 dead end module vmax 200 ml amicon the surface area of the tested membrane was 32 2 cm2 ha was chosen as the representative foulants to load the filter the utilized ha solution with initial concentration of 5 9 mg c l were prepared by dissolving the solid ha in water at ph 9 adjusted with naoh during the filtration experiment the trans membrane pressure tmp was kept constant at 0 1 mpa filtrate was collected and the mass of it was monitored online by a digital balance the permeate flux could be calculated based on the volume of collected filtrate filtration duration and area of the membrane permeate flux of the clean membrane was firstly measured by deionized water then prepared ha solution was used to challenge the membrane without recirculation after filtration of certain volume of ha solution permeate flux of the fouled membrane was determined again by deionized water the filtration experiment was ended when permeate flux of the fouled membrane declined to about 50 of that of the clean one when practical river water was used to challenge the membrane the same experimental procedures were conducted fouled membrane was firstly washed thoroughly by deionized water to remove the reversible fouling then the chemical membrane cleaning process was conducted by immerging the fouled membrane into 90 ml h2o2 solution 0 5 wt containing 25 mg mno2 particles the washing process lasted for 5 min then the washed membrane was taken out from h2o2 solution and washed with deionized water to remove the residual chemicals on surface permeate flux of the washed membrane was determined by the same method aforementioned meanwhile the filtration efficiencies of ha for clean fouled and washed membranes were determined by comparing the total organic carbon toc values of the feed and permeate for toc measurement 40 ml of feed or permeate was sampled and ph of the sample was adjusted to 6 by hydrochloric acid before the measurement at least three duplicated experiments were conducted under every experimental condition 2 2 analytic methods the utilized mno2 particles were characterized by xrd x pert powedr010301 panalytical b v scanning electron microscopy sem quanta 200feg fei and dynamic light scattering dls malvern zetasizer nano zs toc was measured by a toc analyzer apg basisgerät analytik jena ag influences of chemical cleaning process on characteristics of the membrane were determined by sem images of the membrane surface before and after cleaning and atomic force microscopy afm bioscope resolve030118 bruker was utilized to monitor the morphology changes of the membrane the changes of contact angle of the membrane were also measured by a goniometer yh 168 a jinsheng co ltd to verify the generated reactive free radicals the electron spin resonance esr elexsys ii e560 bruker tests were conducted in water with dmpo as the spin trapping agent moreover quenching experiments with benzoquinone and tertiary butanol as the free radical scavengers for superoxide ions o2 and hydroxyl radicals oh respectively were also conducted fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir tests for ha before and after the reaction in h2o2 mno2 system were further conducted to determine the structural changes of the ha caused by the free radicals 2 3 evaluation of the cleaning process the resistance in series model was utilized widely to characterize the membrane fouling process fabris et al 2007 the membrane resistance could be described as follows 1 r m r r e v r i r r δ p η j where r m represented the intrinsic membrane resistance 1 m r r e v represented reversible fouling resistance 1 m r i r r represented the irreversible fouling resistance 1 m δ p was tmp pa η was the dynamic viscosity pa s and j was the permeate flux m3 m2 s the filtration efficiency of membrane was calculated by 2 e c l e a n f o u l e d w a s h e d 1 t e t 0 where e c l e a n f o u l e d w a s h e d represented the filtration efficiency of clean fouled washed membrane t 0 was the toc of original ha solution mg l and t e was the toc of filtrate after being filtrated by the corresponding membrane mg l in this study the performance of the chemical cleaning process would be evaluated by comparing the clean membrane fouled membrane and membrane after being washed in terms of irreversible fouling resistance r i r r c l e a n r i r r f o u l e d r i r r w a s h e d permeate flux j c l e a n j f o u l e d j w a s h e d and filtration efficiency of ha e c l e a n e f o u l e d e w a s h e d 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mno2 particles the utilized mno2 particles were characterized by sem and xrd with the results shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1a the typical mno2 particles were irregularly shaped with rough surface and the size of them was generally less than 2 μm the diffraction peaks of xrd pattern shown in fig 1b demonstrated the polymorph of pyrolusite β mno2 the average size of mno2 particles dispersed in water were 199 1 nm measured by dynamic light scattering dls malvern zetasizer nano zs 3 2 performance of h2o2 mno2 system for membrane cleaning before cleaning the membrane by h2o2 mno2 system the reversible fouling had been removed by water rinsing thoroughly as shown in eq 1 r r e v r i r r represented the total resistance caused by foulants and r r e v was calculated to be accounted for 35 4 of r r e v r i r r fig 2 further illustrated the performance of h2o2 mno2 system for membrane cleaning evaluated by irreversible fouling resistance 1 r i r r w a s h e d r i r r f o u l e d permeate flux j w a s h e d j c l e a n as well as the filtration efficiency of ha e w a s h e d e c l e a n for pvdf membrane j w a s h e d recovered to 97 of j c l e a n after being washed in h2o2 mno2 system for 5 min correspondingly about 97 of r i r r f o u l e d was removed after being washed the high recovery of j and the prominent decline of r i r r demonstrated the efficient removal of irreversible foulants by h2o2 mno2 system moreover the almost equal values of e c l e a n and e w a s h e d indicated that the cleaning process did not influence the filtration performance of the membrane severely otherwise e w a s h e d would be much less than e c l e a n as shown in fig 2 similar conclusions could also be drawn for pes membrane which was less anti oxidative than pvdf membrane however controlling experiments conducted by immerging the fouled membrane into 0 5 wt h2o2 without mno2 for 5 min demonstrated no recovery of j j f o u l e d j c l e a n 0 51 j w a s h e d j c l e a n 0 53 furthermore clean pes membranes were also utilized to filtrate natural river water from songhua river china the results demonstrated that h2o2 mno2 system could recover j w a s h e d to 96 of j c l e a n with the removal of 95 of r i r r f o u l e d detailed results were shown in supporting information so the new system exhibited high potential for practical application the experimental results verified that the h2o2 mno2 system could achieve the efficient membrane cleaning and neglected influence on filtration efficiency simultaneously influences of mno2 dosage and h2o2 concentration on membrane cleaning were also tested details were shown in supporting information and the results showed that the recovery ratio of permeate flux increased prominently from 0 71 to 0 95 when h2o2 concentration enhanced from 0 1 to 0 5 while the recovery ratio only slightly enhanced to 0 98 with the continual increase of h2o2 concentration from 0 5 to 1 nevertheless no prominent effects on the cleaning performance was observed when mno2 dosage increased from 25 mg to 60 mg the recovery ratio of permeate flux under the two conditions were comparable at the values of 0 95 and 0 91 respectively to further test the feasibility of h2o2 mno2 system consecutive fouling and cleaning of one membrane was conducted for the less anti oxidative pes membrane the evolutions of j w a s h e d j c l e a n and e w a s h e d during the test were shown in fig 3 it illustrated that j w a s h e d j c l e a n and e w a s h e d of the membrane could still be retained almost consistently even after 6 runs of consecutive fouling and cleaning so h2o2 mno2 system was an effective and durable cleaning method to remove irreversible fouling more detailed characteristics of the pes membrane after consecutive fouling and cleaning were shown in the supporting information which demonstrated that the characteristics of the membrane were changed to some extent resulting from the generated free radicals which would be discussed in the following section while as shown in fig 3 the performance of the membrane in terms of filtration efficiency and permeate flux were not change prominently due to the damage to membrane materials chemical cleaning process might change the hydrophobicity hydrophilcity of the membrane characterized by contact angle as shown in table 1 for both pes and pvdf membrane no changes of contact angles were observed between clean membranes and washed ones indicating the inertness of h2o2 mno2 system on the membrane hydrophobicity hydrophilcity it should be noticed that clean pvdf membrane contact angle 80 was much more hydrophobic than clean pes membrane contact angle 57 interestingly the irreversible foulants of ha made pes membrane more hydrophobic with the contact angle increased from 57 to 68 for fouled membrane however it made pvdf membrane more hydrophilic with the contact angle decreased from 80 to 68 for fouled membrane the same contact angle for both fouled pvdf and pes membranes was possibly due to the fact that the irreversible foulants of ha covered on the surface of membranes determined the hydrophobicity hydrophilcity of the surface dominantly 3 3 microscopic analyses for the changes of membrane structure 3 3 1 sem images for membrane surface sem was utilized to detect the changes of membrane surface before and after cleaning with the results shown in fig 4 the surfaces of both original pvdf and pes membranes were clean fig 4a and b in which the observed particles and scratches on the membrane surfaces came from the drying and transportation processes during the preparation of sem samples however as shown in fig 4c and d even after being washed by deionized water thoroughly to remove the reversible foulants the surfaces of fouled membranes were still covered with irreversible foulants when h2o2 mno2 system was utilized to wash the fouled membrane for 5 min it could be observed clearly that the membrane surfaces has been recovered and cleaned and almost no irreversible foulants were remained fig 4e and f more sem images were shown in the supporting information 3 3 2 three dimensional afm observation for membrane surface three dimensional afm observation was further utilized to investigate the morphological changes of pvdf and pes membranes before and after membrane cleaning by h2o2 mno2 system as shown in fig 5 compared with clean membranes the non uniform distribution of irreversible foulants leading to the significant enhancement of roughness of the membrane surface while after being washed by h2o2 mno2 system the surface morphology of both pvdf and pes membranes was recovered and was smooth distinctly the corresponding afm section analysis shown in the supporting information also demonstrated the effectiveness of membrane cleaning clearly as the parameters to describe the surface roughness of the membrane quantitatively root mean square surface roughness rq and the average surface roughness ra were calculated and listed in table 2 it revealed that for pes membrane rq ra increased from 6 17 3 5 nm to 135 110 nm after being fouled then was recovered prominently to 24 9 16 2 nm after being washed by h2o2 mno2 system for pvdf membrane the similar trend could also be observed for both pes and pvdf membranes although rq ra of washed membranes was much lower than those of fouled ones they are still prominently higher than the values of clean membranes for pes membrane the rq ra of washed membranes were even more than four times of those of clean ones the higher roughness of washed membranes compared with clean ones might be due to the existence of irreversible foulants which were still left on the membrane surface after membrane washing meanwhile the friction between mno2 particles and membrane during the cleaning process might also generate scratches on the membrane surface resulting in enhanced roughness 3 4 mechanisms for membrane cleaning by h2o2 mno2 system 3 4 1 identification of reactive species as mentioned above the reactive components such as free radicals generated during the membrane cleaning process by oxidants played dominant role for the removal of irreversible foulants to identify the reactive components in h2o2 mno2 system esr tests were conducted to detect the generated free radicals qualitatively as shown in fig 6 superoxide adduct dmpo ooh and hydroxyl adduct dmpo oh appeared in h2o2 mno2 system simultaneously however after about 10 min the dmpo ooh signal was almost extinguished entirely due to the rapid dismutation of o2 in water and the transformation of dmpo ooh to dmpo oh shi et al 2005 zhao et al 2001 it should be noted that for both dmpo ooh and dmpo oh the intensities of the characteristic peaks did not follow the typical ratio e g 1 2 2 1 for the four characteristic peaks of dmpo oh resulting from the mentioned transformation of dmpo ooh to dmpo oh and the coexistence of o2 and oh olha et al 2009 zhao et al 2001 given the fact that both the generated oh and the decomposition of dmpo ooh could lead to the formation of dmpo oh other methods besides esr were further needed to confirm the coexistence of o2 and oh in the system to further confirm the dominant reactive species in h2o2 mno2 system quenching experiments with para benzoquinone p bq and tertiary butanol tba as the conventional scavengers for o2 and oh were also conducted ding et al 2014 hayyan et al 2017 as discussed above without scavengers membrane cleaning by h2o2 mno2 system could recover the permeate flux from about 50 to 94 of j c l e a n and the calculation based on eq 1 revealed that 92 of r i r r f o u l e d was removed for the tested pes membrane however as shown in fig 7 with the addition of p bq as o2 scavenger j w a s h e d was only recovered to 81 of j c l e a n and only 59 of r i r r f o u l e d was removed similarly with the addition of tba as oh scavenger j w a s h e d was only recovered to 71 of j c l e a n and only 37 of r i r r f o u l e d was removed for the tested pes membrane moreover the concentrations of p bq and tba used in fig 7 were 6 mmol l and no more inhibition effects were observed when the concentration of them increased to 10 mmol l which indicated the complete quenching of the free radicals by the scavengers by comparing the removal efficiencies of r i r r f o u l e d under the mentioned there conditions 92 without scavengers 59 with p bq as o2 scavenger and 37 with tba as oh scavengers the general balance among them 59 37 96 which was comparable with 92 confirmed the coexistence of o2 and oh in h2o2 mno2 system and they were the dominant reactive species for the degradation of irreversible foulants furthermore the relative contribution of o2 and oh to the removal of ha could also be estimated based on the removal efficiencies of r i r r f o u l e d approximate 60 of irreversible fouling removal was attributed to oh and the rest were owing to o2 dominantly nitro blue tetrazolium nbt a widely utilized biochemical reagent for o2 detection was also used as the probe of o2 generation in h2o2 mno2 system the reduction of nbt by o2 would generate the blue formazan that could be monitored by spectrophotometry ε550 nm 15000 m 1 cm 1 for the monoformazan bielski et al 1980 hayyan et al 2017 zhou et al 2006 as shown in figure s2 the gradually increased absorbance at the wavelength of 550 nm indicated the generation of o2 in the system again it is a fact that o2 undergoes rapid disproportionation and formation of hydrogen bonds in deionized water resulting in the unreactiveness of it with the pollutants however the existence of mno2 in h2o2 mno2 system provides solid surface to enhance the reactivity of o2 furman et al 2009 recent study also revealed the surface defect dependence of reactive oxygen species including o2 oh and o2 2 over birnessite type mno2 yang et al 2018 which was consistent with the results of this study moreover as aforementioned controlling experiments were also conducted by immerging the fouled membrane into 0 5 wt h2o2 without mno2 for 5 min the results of almost no recovery of j nor decline of r i r r confirmed the dominant role of free radicals to remove the irreversible foulants again 3 4 2 proposed mechanisms for membrane cleaning the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 on the surface of mno2 was complicated and some typical reactions were described as follows do et al 2009 lin and gurol 1998 sorge et al 2004 h 2 o 2 m n o 2 o h m n o 2 o h h 2 o 2 m n o 2 o h h 2 o 2 m n o 2 h o o h 2 o h 2 o 2 h o o h 2 o o h o 2 h o o o h o 2 h 2 o where mno2 oh h2o2 represented the initial transition state of mno2 bonded with h2o2 summary of the possible reactions was described by do et al 2009 and sorge et al 2004 as shown in the above reactions free radicals and oxygen could be generated simultaneously during the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 and both of them contributed to the membrane cleaning in h2o2 mno2 system it has been well known that free radicals were able to transform the organic irreversible foulants to substances which were less hydrophobic and more susceptible to hydrolysis porcelli and judd 2010 thurman 2012 so the adhesive force between foulants and membrane would be weakened to verify the structural changes of ha during the membrane cleaning process batch experiment was conducted by adding ha directly into h2o2 mno2 system ftir spectra of ha before and after the reaction were shown in fig 8 it could be observed that the characteristic peaks of the typical hydrophobic groups such as the peak at about 1400 cm 1 representing the c h deformation of aliphatic and ch3 groups yu et al 2005 between 600 cm 1 and 700 cm 1 representing c h out of plane deformation fukushima et al 2001 and between 800 cm 1 and 900 cm 1 representing c c anti symmetric ring stretching fukushima et al 2001 were almost disappeared after reaction however the characteristic peaks of the typical hydrophilic groups such as the peak at about 1600 cm 1 representing co stretching vibration of carboxyl and ketones quinones amir et al 2010 and at about 3400 cm 1 representing oh groups of alcohols phenols and organic acids yu et al 2005 were still remained the results of ftir spectra implied that ha would become more hydrophilic by the reactions occurred in h2o2 mno2 system which was consistent with the previous studies furthermore in addition to free radicals the phenomena of turbulent flow condition and the intense motion of mno2 particles caused by the abundant oxygen production in h2o2 mno2 system could be observed clearly with the video listed in the supporting information as expected turbulent condition of the system turned to be placid gradually with the continual consumption of h2o2 supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2019 115111 the following is the supplementary data related to this article multimedia component 11 given the fact that the reversible fouling has been removed before the membrane cleaning by h2o2 mno2 system and the free radicals were dominantly attributed to the removal of irreversible fouling the abundant oxygen generation contributed to the membrane cleaning mainly in terms of accelerating the mass transfer and facilitating the detachment of foulants after chemical reactions firstly turbulent flow generated by the abundant production of oxygen could accelerate the mass transfer of free radicals from solution to irreversible foulants secondly turbulent flow as well as the raising up oxygen stream might strengthen the shearing force to strip the already less hydrophobic foulants from the membrane finally the intense motion and well dispersion of mno2 particles in the system caused by the raising up oxygen stream might also promote the removal of foulants through the friction between mno2 particles and membrane overall the removal of foulants in h2o2 mno2 system was attributed to the physico chemical membrane cleaning process 4 conclusion novel h2o2 mno2 system was developed to achieve highly efficient membrane cleaning for both pvdf and pes membranes fouled by humic acid and river water the outstanding membrane cleaning performance was attributed to the simultaneous generation of free radicals and oxygen leading to the physico chemical membrane cleaning moreover the almost equal values of e c l e a n and e w a s h e d indicated that the generated free radicals in h2o2 mno2 system did not influence the filtration performance of the membrane prominently which might be attributed to the short washing duration for only 5 min and the low concentration of h2o2 utilized resulting in the alleviation of damage to membrane structure by the free radicals based on the results of this study following researches are needed to test the changes of membrane structure caused by the h2o2 mno2 system in depth furthermore in order to apply this system for practical water treatment process questions such as whether it also works for the removal of inorganic foulants whether the outstanding performance could also be achieved for hollow fiber membranes and the further optimization of the system are still needed to be studied systematically declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18437,the novel h2o2 mno2 system was developed to achieve highly efficient membrane cleaning for both fouled pvdf and pes membranes in this study compared with conventional chemical cleaning process in which the whole membrane module had to be soaked in highly concentrated solution of chemical reagent for long period of time the h2o2 mno2 cleaning process conducting for only 5 min in 0 5 wt h2o2 solution could achieve more than 95 recovery of permeate flux and almost total removal of the irreversible foulants more importantly the permeate flux and filtration efficiency of the membrane could be still kept stable after 6 runs of consecutive fouling and cleaning based on the systematic microscopic analyses electron spin resonance esr fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir as well as the quenching experiments with different free radical scavengers the outstanding performance of h2o2 mno2 system was attributed to the generation of both free radicals and abundant oxygen simultaneously leading to the physico chemical membrane cleaning conclusively the newly developed h2o2 mno2 system demonstrated noteworthy advantages on efficient membrane cleaning and exhibited highly potential for the wide application in practical water treatment process graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane cleaning physico chemical cleaning mno2 h2o2 1 introduction during the recent decade membrane filtration technologies such as microfiltration ultrafiltration and membrane bioreactors have been drawn great attention and widely promoted for the treatment of both drinking and waste water to maintain the stable operation of the filtration process regular membrane cleaning is required to control the membrane fouling guarantee the effluent quality and keep the appropriate membrane flux bagheri and mirbagheri 2018 shi et al 2014 among various types of membrane cleaning processes the most widely utilized ones are still the conventional physical membrane cleaning and chemical membrane cleaning the physical membrane cleaning processes such as air scouring backflushing and relaxation are effective to remove the reversible fouling while the irreversible fouling can be removed by the chemical cleaning processes with the utilization of acids bases and oxidants kimura et al 2004 strugholtz et al 2005 wang et al 2014 the chemical cleaning with naclo or h2o2 as oxidants can oxidize the complicated functional groups of foulants to ketonic aldehyde or carboxyl groups wang et al 2014 through the chemical cleaning by oxidants size of the foulants will be decreased meanwhile the foulants will become less hydrophobic resulting in the weakening of adhesive force between membrane and them so it is very effective to remove the irreversible organic and biological foulants wang et al 2014 the essential step of conventional chemical cleaning is to soak the fouled membrane into the solution of cleaning reagent for severe organic fouling even dozens of hours are needed for the soaking period however problems including low mass transfer rate of the reactive components abundant dosage of cleaning reagents and the damage of membrane structure by the cleaning reagents especially oxidants are commonly existed during the chemical cleaning process porcelli and judd 2010 these problems weaken the performance of the cleaning process observably nevertheless there are still seldom effective methods to deal with them at the present the commonly utilized membrane materials such as polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf polyethersulfone pes and polysulfone ps are generally highly hydrophobic so they restrain the transportation of reactive components for membrane cleaning from cleaning solution to the membrane surface and further into the membrane holes meanwhile the irreversible foulants left on the surface of membrane also block the pathway for reactive components transporting from the surface to membrane holes the effective mass transfer is especially important for the chemical cleaning with oxidants because the generation of reactive components such as free radicals occurs continuously at the expense of oxidants e g h2o2 naclo and the lifetime of them is always extremely short methods to enhance the mass transfer rate by previous studies include hydrophilization of the membrane material temperature increment of the system generation of turbulent flow by aeration and increment of the chemical dosage bagheri and mirbagheri 2018 porcelli and judd 2010 while limitations are still existed in these methods such as the enhancement of material cost due to the modification of the membrane material and the enhancement of operational cost if heating and aeration facilities are equipped to the filtration setup increment of the chemical dosage is easier to operate compared with other methods however as mentioned above structure of the membrane will be damaged through long term direct contact with the oxidative components the irreversible foulants distribute unevenly on the surface and inside of the membrane chen et al 2007 2017 kim et al 2015 while the whole membrane module has to be soaked in the chemical reagent solution during the conventional chemical cleaning process so clean parts of the membrane will contact with the oxidant directly for long time resulting in the damage of membrane structure conclusively there is still high demand to develop the new types of membrane cleaning technology with the characteristics of low energy cost high efficiency low chemical dosage and less damage to the membrane structure during the cleaning process mno2 is widely utilized in practical water treatment process due to its well performances as both adsorbent and catalyst cao et al 2011 zhang and sun 2013 meanwhile the low price of it also reduce the overall cost of water treatment process mno2 can act as photo catalyst through the semi conductor mechanism and photothermal mechanism villaseñor et al 2002 yang et al 2017 moreover it can also generate reactive free radicals to degrade pollutants through the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 he et al 2017 wani et al 2016 recent study has anchored mno2 nanoparticles on the commercial desalination membrane surfaces to eliminated colloidal and organic fouling by the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 guha et al 2017 besides mno2 effective biofouling control could also be achieved by periodic h2o2 cleaning with cuo modified spacers in membrane based desalination processes yang et al 2019 in this study the h2o2 mno2 system was developed to clean the fouled membrane for the first time the efficient generation of reactive free radicals by catalytic decomposition of h2o2 and the turbulent flow generated by the extensive production of oxygen led to the much more effective membrane cleaning compared with the conventional soaking method furthermore systematic microscopic analysis esr tests ftir tests and quenching experiments were conducted to evaluate the membrane cleaning performance and explain the related mechanisms in depth 2 material and methods 2 1 material and experimental setup the tested membrane included flat sheet

dead end module vmax 200 ml amicon the surface area of the tested membrane was 32 2 cm2 ha was chosen as the representative foulants to load the filter the utilized ha solution with initial concentration of 5 9 mg c l were prepared by dissolving the solid ha in water at ph 9 adjusted with naoh during the filtration experiment the trans membrane pressure tmp was kept constant at 0 1 mpa filtrate was collected and the mass of it was monitored online by a digital balance the permeate flux could be calculated based on the volume of collected filtrate filtration duration and area of the membrane permeate flux of the clean membrane was firstly measured by deionized water then prepared ha solution was used to challenge the membrane without recirculation after filtration of certain volume of ha solution permeate flux of the fouled membrane was determined again by deionized water the filtration experiment was ended when permeate flux of the fouled membrane declined to about 50 of that of the clean one when practical river water was used to challenge the membrane the same experimental procedures were conducted fouled membrane was firstly washed thoroughly by deionized water to remove the reversible fouling then the chemical membrane cleaning process was conducted by immerging the fouled membrane into 90 ml h2o2 solution 0 5 wt containing 25 mg mno2 particles the washing process lasted for 5 min then the washed membrane was taken out from h2o2 solution and washed with deionized water to remove the residual chemicals on surface permeate flux of the washed membrane was determined by the same method aforementioned meanwhile the filtration efficiencies of ha for clean fouled and washed membranes were determined by comparing the total organic carbon toc values of the feed and permeate for toc measurement 40 ml of feed or permeate was sampled and ph of the sample was adjusted to 6 by hydrochloric acid before the measurement at least three duplicated experiments

were further conducted to determine the structural changes of the ha caused by the free radicals 2 3 evaluation of the cleaning process the resistance in series model was utilized widely to

system for 5 min correspondingly about 97 of r i r r f o u l e d was removed after being washed the high recovery of j and the prominent decline of r i r r demonstrated the efficient removal of irreversible foulants by h2o2 mno2 system moreover the almost equal values of e c l e a n and e w a s h e d indicated that the cleaning process did not influence the filtration performance of the membrane severely otherwise e w a s h e d would be much less than e c l e a n as shown in fig 2 similar conclusions could also be drawn for pes membrane which was less anti oxidative than pvdf membrane however controlling experiments conducted by immerging the fouled membrane into 0 5 wt h2o2 without mno2 for 5 min demonstrated no recovery of j j f o u l e d j c l e a n 0 51 j w a s h e d j c l e a n 0 53 furthermore clean pes membranes were also utilized to filtrate natural river water from songhua river china the results demonstrated that h2o2 mno2 system could recover j w a s h e d to 96 of j c l e a n with the removal of 95 of r i r r f o u l e d detailed results were shown in supporting information so the new system exhibited high potential for practical application the experimental results verified that the h2o2 mno2 system could achieve the efficient membrane cleaning and neglected influence on filtration efficiency simultaneously influences of mno2 dosage and h2o2 concentration on membrane cleaning were also tested details were shown in supporting information and the results showed that the recovery ratio of permeate flux increased prominently from 0 71 to 0 95 when h2o2 concentration enhanced from 0 1 to 0 5 while the recovery ratio only slightly enhanced to 0 98 with the continual increase of h2o2 concentration from 0 5 to 1 nevertheless no prominent effects on the cleaning performance was observed when mno2 dosage increased from 25 mg to 60 mg the recovery ratio of permeate flux under the two conditions were comparable at the values of 0 95 and 0 91 respectively to further test the feasibility of h2o2 mno2 system consecutive fouling and cleaning of one membrane was conducted for the less anti oxidative pes membrane the evolutions of j w a s h e d j c l e a n and e w a s h e d during the test were shown in fig 3 it illustrated that j w a s h e d j c l e a n and e w a s h e d of the membrane could still be retained almost consistently even after 6 runs of consecutive fouling and cleaning so h2o2 mno2 system was an effective and durable cleaning method to remove irreversible fouling more detailed characteristics of the pes membrane after consecutive fouling and cleaning were shown in the supporting information which demonstrated that the characteristics of the membrane were changed to some extent resulting from the generated free radicals which would be discussed in the following section while as shown in fig 3 the performance of the membrane in terms of filtration efficiency and permeate flux were not change prominently due to the damage to membrane materials chemical cleaning process might change the hydrophobicity hydrophilcity of the membrane characterized by contact angle as shown in table 1 for both pes and pvdf membrane no changes of contact angles were observed between clean membranes and washed ones indicating the inertness of h2o2 mno2 system on the membrane hydrophobicity hydrophilcity it should be noticed that clean pvdf membrane contact angle 80 was much more hydrophobic than clean pes membrane contact angle 57 interestingly the irreversible foulants of ha made pes membrane more hydrophobic with the contact angle increased from 57 to 68 for fouled membrane however it made pvdf membrane more hydrophilic with the contact angle decreased from 80 to 68 for fouled membrane the same contact angle for both fouled pvdf and pes membranes was possibly due to the fact that the irreversible foulants of ha covered on the surface of membranes determined the hydrophobicity hydrophilcity of the surface dominantly 3 3 microscopic analyses for the changes of membrane structure 3 3 1 sem images for membrane surface sem was utilized to detect the changes of membrane surface before and after cleaning with the results shown in fig 4 the surfaces of both original pvdf and pes membranes were clean fig 4a and b in which the observed particles and scratches on the membrane surfaces came from the drying and transportation processes during the preparation of sem samples however as shown in fig 4c and d even after being washed by deionized water thoroughly to remove the reversible foulants the surfaces of fouled membranes were still covered with irreversible foulants when h2o2 mno2 system was utilized to wash the fouled membrane for 5 min it could be observed clearly that the membrane surfaces has been recovered and cleaned and almost no irreversible foulants were remained fig 4e and f more sem images were shown in the supporting information 3 3 2 three dimensional afm observation for membrane surface three dimensional afm observation was further utilized to investigate the morphological changes of pvdf and pes membranes before and after membrane cleaning by h2o2 mno2 system as shown in fig 5 compared with clean membranes the non uniform distribution of irreversible foulants leading to the significant enhancement of roughness of the membrane surface while after being washed by h2o2 mno2 system the surface morphology of both pvdf and pes membranes was recovered and was smooth distinctly the corresponding afm section analysis shown in the supporting information also demonstrated the effectiveness of membrane cleaning clearly as the parameters to describe the surface roughness of the membrane quantitatively root mean square surface roughness rq and the average surface roughness ra were calculated and listed in table 2 it revealed that for pes membrane rq ra increased from 6 17 3 5 nm to 135 110 nm after being fouled then was recovered prominently to 24 9 16 2 nm after being washed by h2o2 mno2 system for pvdf membrane the similar trend could also be observed for both pes and pvdf membranes although rq ra of washed membranes was much lower than those of fouled ones they are still prominently higher than the values of clean membranes for pes membrane the rq ra of washed membranes were even more than four times of those of clean ones the higher roughness of washed membranes compared with clean ones might be due to the existence of irreversible foulants which were still left on the membrane surface after membrane washing meanwhile the friction between mno2 particles and membrane during the cleaning process might also generate scratches on the membrane surface resulting in enhanced roughness 3 4 mechanisms for membrane cleaning by h2o2 mno2 system 3 4 1 identification of reactive species as mentioned above the reactive components such as free radicals generated during the membrane cleaning process by oxidants played dominant role for the removal of irreversible foulants to identify the reactive components in h2o2 mno2 system esr tests were conducted to detect the generated free radicals qualitatively as shown in fig 6 superoxide adduct dmpo ooh and hydroxyl adduct dmpo oh appeared in h2o2 mno2 system simultaneously however after about 10 min the dmpo ooh signal was almost extinguished entirely due to the rapid dismutation of o2 in water and the transformation of dmpo ooh to dmpo oh shi et al 2005 zhao et al 2001 it should be noted that for both dmpo ooh and dmpo oh the intensities of the characteristic peaks did not follow the typical ratio e g 1 2 2 1 for the four characteristic peaks of dmpo oh resulting from the mentioned transformation of dmpo ooh to dmpo oh and the coexistence of o2 and oh olha et al 2009 zhao et al 2001 given the fact that both the generated oh and the decomposition of dmpo ooh could lead to the formation of dmpo oh other methods besides esr were further needed to confirm the coexistence of o2 and oh in the system to further confirm the dominant reactive species in h2o2 mno2 system quenching experiments with para benzoquinone p bq and tertiary butanol tba as the conventional scavengers for o2 and oh were also conducted ding et al 2014 hayyan et al 2017 as discussed above without scavengers membrane cleaning by h2o2 mno2 system could recover the permeate flux from about 50 to 94 of j c l e a n and the calculation based on eq 1 revealed that 92 of r i r r f o u l e d was removed for the tested pes membrane however as shown in fig 7 with the addition of p bq as o2 scavenger j w a s h e d was only recovered to 81 of j c l e a n and only 59 of r i r r f o u l e d was removed similarly with the addition of tba as oh scavenger j w a s h e d was only recovered to 71 of j c l e a n and only 37 of r i r r f o u l e d was removed for the tested pes membrane moreover the concentrations of p bq and tba used in fig 7 were 6 mmol l and no more inhibition effects were observed when the concentration of them increased to 10 mmol l which indicated the complete quenching of the free radicals by the scavengers by comparing the removal efficiencies of r i r r f o u l e d under the mentioned there conditions 92 without scavengers 59 with p bq as o2 scavenger and 37 with tba as oh scavengers the general balance among them 59 37 96 which was comparable with 92 confirmed the coexistence of o2 and oh in h2o2 mno2 system and they were the dominant reactive species for the degradation of irreversible foulants furthermore the relative contribution of o2 and oh to the removal of ha could also be estimated based on the removal efficiencies of r i r r f o u l e d approximate 60 of irreversible fouling removal was attributed to oh and the rest were owing to o2 dominantly nitro blue tetrazolium nbt a widely utilized biochemical reagent for o2 detection was also used as the probe of o2 generation in h2o2 mno2 system the reduction of nbt by o2 would generate the blue formazan that could be monitored by spectrophotometry ε550 nm 15000 m 1 cm 1 for the monoformazan bielski et al 1980 hayyan et al 2017 zhou et al 2006 as shown in figure s2 the gradually increased absorbance at the wavelength of 550 nm indicated the generation of o2 in the system again it is a fact that o2 undergoes rapid disproportionation and formation of hydrogen bonds in deionized water resulting in the unreactiveness of it with the pollutants however the existence of mno2 in h2o2 mno2 system provides solid surface to enhance the reactivity of o2 furman et al 2009 recent study also revealed the surface defect dependence of reactive oxygen species including o2 oh and o2 2 over birnessite type mno2 yang et al 2018 which was consistent with the results of this study moreover as aforementioned controlling experiments were also conducted by immerging the fouled membrane into 0 5 wt h2o2 without mno2 for 5 min the results of almost no recovery of j nor decline of r i r r confirmed the dominant role of free radicals to remove the irreversible foulants again 3 4 2 proposed mechanisms for membrane cleaning the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 on the surface of mno2 was complicated and some typical reactions were described as follows do et al 2009 lin and gurol 1998 sorge et al 2004 h 2 o 2 m n o 2 o h m n o 2 o h h 2 o 2 m n o 2 o h h 2 o 2 m n o 2 h o o h 2 o h 2 o 2 h o o h 2 o o h o 2 h o o o h o 2 h 2 o where mno2 oh h2o2 represented the initial transition state of mno2 bonded with h2o2 summary of the possible reactions was described by do et al 2009 and sorge et al 2004 as shown in the above reactions free radicals and oxygen could be generated simultaneously during the catalytic decomposition of h2o2 and both of them contributed to the membrane cleaning in h2o2 mno2 system it has been well known that free radicals were able to transform the organic irreversible foulants to substances which were less hydrophobic and more susceptible to hydrolysis porcelli and judd 2010 thurman 2012 so the adhesive force between foulants and membrane would be weakened to verify the structural changes of ha during the membrane cleaning process batch experiment was conducted by adding ha directly into h2o2 mno2 system ftir spectra of ha before and after the reaction were shown in fig 8 it could be observed that the characteristic peaks of the typical hydrophobic groups such as the peak at about 1400 cm 1 representing the c h deformation of aliphatic and ch3 groups yu et al 2005 between 600 cm 1 and 700 cm 1 representing c h out of plane deformation fukushima et al 2001 and between 800 cm 1 and 900 cm 1 representing c c anti symmetric ring stretching fukushima et al 2001 were almost disappeared after reaction however the characteristic peaks of the typical hydrophilic groups such as the peak at about 1600 cm 1 representing co stretching vibration of carboxyl and ketones quinones amir et al 2010 and at about 3400 cm 1 representing oh groups of alcohols phenols and organic acids yu et al 2005 were still remained the results of ftir spectra implied that ha would become more hydrophilic by the reactions occurred in h2o2 mno2 system which was consistent with the previous studies furthermore in addition to free radicals the phenomena of turbulent flow condition and the intense motion of mno2 particles caused by the abundant oxygen production in h2o2 mno2 system could be observed clearly with the video listed in the supporting information as expected turbulent condition of the system turned to be placid gradually with the continual consumption of h2o2 supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j watres 2019 115111 the following is the supplementary data related to this article multimedia component 11 given the fact that the reversible fouling has been removed before the membrane cleaning by h2o2 mno2 system and the free radicals were dominantly attributed to the removal of irreversible fouling the abundant oxygen generation contributed to the membrane cleaning mainly in terms of accelerating the mass transfer and facilitating the detachment of foulants after chemical reactions firstly turbulent flow generated by the abundant production of oxygen could accelerate the mass transfer of free radicals from solution to irreversible foulants secondly turbulent flow as well as the raising up oxygen stream might strengthen the shearing force to strip the already less hydrophobic foulants from the membrane finally the intense motion and well dispersion of mno2 particles in the system caused by the raising up oxygen stream might also promote the removal of foulants through the friction between mno2 particles and membrane overall the removal of foulants in h2o2 mno2 system was attributed to the physico chemical membrane cleaning process 4 conclusion novel h2o2 mno2 system was developed to achieve highly efficient membrane cleaning for both pvdf and pes membranes fouled by humic acid and river water the outstanding membrane cleaning performance was attributed to the simultaneous generation of free radicals and oxygen leading to the physico chemical membrane cleaning moreover the almost equal values of e c l e a n and e w a s h e d indicated that the generated free radicals in h2o2 mno2 system did not influence the filtration performance of the membrane prominently which might be attributed to the short washing duration for only 5 min and the low concentration of h2o2 utilized resulting in the alleviation of damage to membrane structure by the free radicals based on the results of this study following researches are needed to test the changes of membrane structure caused by the h2o2 mno2 system in depth furthermore in order to apply this system for practical water treatment process questions such as whether it also works for the removal of inorganic foulants whether the outstanding performance could also be achieved for hollow fiber membranes and the further optimization of the system are still needed to be studied systematically declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18438,antimicrobial resistance is a growing public health concern and environment is regarded as an important reservoir and dissemination route for antibiotic resistance genes args to prevent and control arg pollution it is essential to correctly disentangle source sink relationship of args in the environment however accurately apportioning sources of args is still a big challenge due to the complex interaction of multiple sources and contaminants in the environment with changing dynamics in this study we addressed this problem and focused on identifying the potential sources of args in a peri urban river by jointly utilizing two novel microbial source tracking methods to attain the objective sediment water samples were collected from the peri urban river and four arg associated ecotypes including effluents of sewage treatment plants stps stp influent chicken manures and pig manures the high throughput profilings of args and microbial taxa in the river sediments and the four

of human fecal pollution on args in the river sediments further sourcetracker a machine learning classification tool was used for quantifying the contributions of potential sources to args in the river sediments based on the metagenomic signatures of args and microbial taxa in total 888 arg subtypes belonging to 29 arg types were detected across all samples including mcr 1 and a range of carbapenemases types statistical analyses suggested different ecotypes generally had distinct profiles of both args and microbial taxa while the arg compositions were significantly correlated with the microbial community source tracking with crassphage showed the presence of args in the river sediments might be largely impacted by the extent of human fecal pollution which was also confirmed by the analyses of sourcetracker that the discharge from stps was the largest contributor of args 81 6 92 1 and microbes 49 3 68 1 in the river sediments results of the study can help us to better understand the characterization of args in the peri urban ecosystem and to design effective prevention and control strategies for reducing arg dissemination keywords antibiotic resistance genes source identification metagenomic assembly microbial source tracking crassphage sourcetracker 1 introduction antimicrobial resistance is a growing threat to global public health in particular misuse and abuse of antibiotics in community clinical and agricultural settings in the past several decades zhang et al 2015 klein et al 2018 have being accelerated the prevalence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args in the environment zhu et al 2017 karkman et al 2019 recently concerns have being increased over the role of environment as an important reservoir and dissemination route for args bengtsson palme et al 2018 qiao et al 2018 in this realm reliable information that accurately characterizes the occurrence source and fate of args in the environment is particularly important to address the challenge of antimicrobial resistance for health risk assessment and mitigation strategy designment pruden et al 2013 larsson et al 2018 however the presence of args in the environment is a complex problem associated with multiple and interconnected drivers hendriksen et al 2019 and generally entangles our understanding on the origin and transmission of args especially in the highly human impacted environment the peri urban rivers are one of the critical interfaces of urban rural symbiosis ecosystems zheng et al 2018 they not only provide water resource for urban and rural residents but also may be used for more ecosystem services such as agricultural irrigation ecological landscape and recreational purposes unfortunately with the rapid development of industrialization and modernization peri urban rivers receive massive waste potentially containing resistant bacteria and selection pressures for args i e antibiotics metals and biocides from a variety of urban and rural pollution sources such as effluents from sewage treatment plants stps urine manures from livestock farms runoff from fields treated with manures or biosolids and even raw domestic sewage due to sanitary sewer pipeline leakage novo et al 2013 woolhouse and ward 2013 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 su et al 2017 baral et al 2018 munk et al 2018 wang et al 2019 indeed the peri urban rivers appear to be a significant reservoir of args in the environment he et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 in general peri urban rivers are close to human beings thus args in the rivers may be re recruited into the human associated resistome through mobile genetic elements bengtsson palme et al 2018 resulting in health risk to the general public to prevent and control the arg pollution in peri urban rivers it is essential to correctly identify the potential sources of args and quantitatively apportion their contributions however as stated above accurately disentangling the source sink relationship of args is still a challenging topic due to the complex interaction of multiple sources and contaminants i e autochthonous and allochthonous resistant bacteria in the environment with changing dynamics as well as the distinctive dissemination mechanisms of args in difference sources point and non point sources larsson et al 2018 li et al 2018 although some investigations reported the occurrence and distribution of args in urban peri urban rivers and discussed the impact of human activities on arg level luo et al 2010 pruden et al 2012 marathe et al 2017 baral et al 2018 few studies focusing on the source apportionment of args in urban peri urban rivers could be found until now recently two novel tools have been developed and proposed for microbial source tracking mst crassphage and sourcetracker crassphage is a bacteriophage that was reported to be highly abundant and host specific in the human feces and sewage dutilh et al 2014 stachler and bibby 2014 and has been successfully applied for sewage pollution tracking in the environment ahmed et al 2018 kongprajug et al 2019 interestingly studies also reported the co occurrence of crassphage and args in the environment indicating the potential of crassphage as an indicator to be employed for tracking arg sources karkman et al 2019 stachler et al 2019 sourcetracker is a machine learning classification tool and can be used to infer the mixing proportion of sources in a sink sample with community based profiling knights et al 2011 liu et al 2018 in contrast to the single marker method for mst i e crassphage the

sources to the sink environment knights et al 2011 liu et al 2018 li et al 2018 baral et al 2018 in this study we addressed source identification of args in a peri urban river in beijing china by jointly utilizing the two novel mst methods to attain the study objective sediment water samples were collected from the peri urban river and four arg associated ecotypes within the study area including stp effluents stp influents chicken manures and pig manures the high throughput profilings of args and microbial taxa in these samples were comprehensively characterized in combination of shotgun sequencing and metagenomic assembly analysis and the relationship of args with hosts was explored by making use of the arg carrying contigs accs in metagenomic data subsequently crassphage was employed to track the impact of human fecal pollution on args in the river sediments and sourcetracker was used for quantifying the contribution proportions of potential sources to args in the river sediments based on the metagenomic signatures of args and microbial taxa the study will advance our knowledge about the args characteristics in peri urban rivers and help policy makers to design targeted strategies for the prevention and control of arg dissemination 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the chaobai river in beijing fig 1 with a drainage area of 19 500 km2 the chaobai river is a major tributary of the hai river system which is one of the seven largest river basins in china and is a typical peri urban river it originates from north of yanshan mountain flows through hebei beijing tianjin and finally discharges into the bohai sea in this area it is characterized by hot humid summers and generally cold windy dry winters and dominated by the continental temperate monsoon climate with an annual temperature 11 5 c the average precipitation is about 660 mm a highly concentrated from june to september the river not only is the main source of drinking water for megacity beijing but also provides valuable water resource for agricultural irrigation within the basin drainage region however the drastic development of urbanization and modernization in this area especially over the past several decades has made a serious eco environmental challenge on the chaobai river and other peri urban rivers in the jingjinji zone including the pollution problems of micropollutants and emerging contaminants heeb et al 2012 xia 2013 chen et al 2018a 2019 wei et al 2018 2 2 sample collection and public metagenomic datasets collection the surficial river sediments top 5 cm layer were sampled in november 2018 within consecutive days without recent rainfall along the chaobai river fig 1 meanwhile various samples were also collected from four arg associated ecotypes within the study area including three pig farms four chicken farms and seven conventional stps table s1 on each of the pig and chicken farm two manure samples were taken by randomly collecting fresh feces from different compartments or houses of animals at each sampling location three subsamples were collected from the floor and mixed thoroughly into one composite sample for obtaining a minimum of 10 g feces per sample for effluents 2 l water samples were collected from the outlet of each stp in all a total number of 32 samples were collected from the study area including river sediments rs1 rs11 n 11 pig manures pg1 pg6 n 6 chicken manures ck1 ck8 n 8 and stp effluents sw1 sw7 n 7 all samples were stored in sterile plastic containers immediately kept in a refrigerator at 4 c and transported to the laboratory within 24 h in laboratory effluent samples collected from the stps were filtered through 0 45 μm nitrocellulose filters the filters were frozen at 80 c until dna extraction as well as the manure and sediment samples meanwhile the concentrations of antibiotics in sampling sites were considered to understand the characteristics of selection pressure for different sample ecotypes text s1 in addition 10 metagenomics datasets collected in beijing guo et al 2017 su et al 2017 including stp influents si1 si8 n 8 and sludge sw8 sw9 n 2 were downloaded from the ncbi sra details about the dataset used in this study were summarized in table s2 2 3 dna extraction and shotgun metagenomic sequencing according to the manufacturer s instructions total dna was extracted for each sample using a tianamp dna kit for soil tiangen biotech china dna quality was evaluated using gel electrophoresis 1 agarose and its concentration was determined with qubit dsdna assay kit in qubit 2 0 flurometer life technologies usa the high quality dna for each sample 1 μg was used to construct sequencing libraries 350 bp paired end by utilizing nebnext ultra dna library prep kit for illumina neb usa and shotgun sequencing was performed on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform using the sequencing strategy of 150 bp paired end 2 4 metagenomic assembly and open reading frame prediction the raw metagenomic sequences of samples collected from the study area n 32 and the downloaded public metagenomic data n 10 were both filtered using fastp v0 19 5 chen et al 2018b to remove the reads containing low quality sequences in all approximately 6 0 gb of clean data was obtained for each sample resulting in a total of 254 gb data output for further analysis table s2 subsequently the clean reads for each sample were assembled separately using megahit v1 1 2 set as presets meta large to obtain scaftigs li et al 2015b further the scaftigs generated from the assembly were filtered to remove those shorter than 500 bp and were used to predict open reading frames orfs with metaprodigal v2 6 3 set as p meta hyatt et al 2012 then the predicted orfs longer than 100 nt were clustered using cd hit software v4 6 8 to generate a non redundant gene catalogue for downstream analysis under a criterion of 95 identity over 90 of the shorter orf length set as c 0 95 g 0 as 0 9 g 1 d 0 li and godzik 2006 in total about 10 2 million contigs average length 1142 bp were assembled to be used for orf prediction resulting in about 12 1 million non redundant genes table s2 2 5 arg and taxonomic annotations the predicted protein sequences of orfs were aligned against the deeparg db database which is a recent release of manually curated arg database and expands the repertoire of args currently accessible for metagenomic analysis of environment datasets with a high degree of confidence arango argoty et al 2018 the alignment was performed using blastp implemented in the diamond v0 9 17 118 buchfink et al 2015 with e value cutoff of 1e 10 an orf was annotated as arg like sequence if the blastp alignments exceeded 50 identity over 70 of the query coverages arango argoty et al 2018 on the other hand taxonomic annotation of the orfs was conducted using a novel metagenome classifier kaiju v1 6 3 menzel et al 2016 in which reads were searched for maximum exact matches against the progenomes database mende et al 2017 at the protein level with the burrows wheeler transform 2 6 crassphage annotation the crassphage genome accession nc 024711 1 was downloaded from ncbi and indexed using bowtie2 for subsequent mapping v2 3 4 3 langmead and salzberg 2012 then the quality processed metagenomic reads were mapped against the crassphage genome using bowtie2 and the coverage of crassphage genome was calculated using samtools v1 9 li et al 2009 for comparison other two phage genomes and three virus genomes including phage crass001 mh675552 1 phage ɸb124 14 he608841 1 pepper mild mottle virus nc 003630 1 human adenovirus f nc 001454 and human polyomavirus jc nc 001699 1 were also downloaded and done exactly as with crassphage because both of them were reported in previous studies as potential indictors of fecal pollution rachmadi et al 2016 ogilvie et al 2018 shkoporov et al 2018 gyawali et al 2019 2 7 source tracker analysis the machine learning classification tool sourcetracker v1 0 1 knights et al 2011 was employed to apportion the relative contribution of args from the four arg associated ecotypes to the river sediments including stp influents stp effluents sludge pig feces and chicken feces the sourcetracker utilizes a bayesian classification model together with gibbs sampling to compare the metagenomic signatures i e broad spectrum arg profiling or microbial community fingerprint in the source environments to those in the sink environments for estimating the extent of contribution of each source to the sink liu et al 2018 baral et al 2018 to reduce the effect of false predictions five independent runs were performed for each sourcetracker analysis using default settings 2 8 statistical and network analyses several statistical tools mainly including adonis test pearson correlation analysis procrustes analysis non metric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds and constrained ordination principal co ordinates analysis cpcoa were used to investigate the correlations or differences between args taxa and samples network analysis was employed to explore the co occurrence of args and microbial community based on their strong and significant correlation matrixes spearman s ρ 0 7 p value 0 01 su et al 2017 all the statistical analyses were conducted in the open source software r v3 5 2 by utilizing several r packages including car gunifrac and vegan network visualization was performed using gephi v0 9 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence composition and diversity of args in this study various samples were collected from the peri urban river sink n 11 and four arg associated ecotypes source n 31 within the study area for disentangling the source sink relationship of args to explore the critical factor of resistome dissemination in the environment after sequencing and assembly 42 metagenomic datasets were aligned against the deeparg db reference database to identify and classify the arg like orfs according to the structured arg resource to make all metagenomes comparable the coverage of the identified args was normalized to the size of each metagenomic dataset in units of times per giga base gb and the abundance of a particular arg type or subtype was calculated by summing the coverages of the identified arg sequences belonging to the that arg type or subtype xiong et al 2018 in total 29 of all 30 arg types included in the deeparg db were detected in at least one of the 42 samples fig s1 with the top 3 most abundant types against multidrug macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls and bacitracin as expected the args associated with the commonly used antibiotics such as sulfonamide tetracycline quinolone trimethoprim and beta lactam table s3 were widespread across all of sample types fig s1 in particular multidrug resistance mdr was identified as the most abundant type in most of the samples table 1 largely due to the ubiquity of mdr efflux pumps in prokaryotes pearson correlation analysis showed the coverage of multidrug resistance genes was positively correlated with the total arg coverage r 2 0 841 p value 0 05 however genes encoding mdr efflux pumps are usually located on the chromosomes and may not have evolved originally to confer resistance against antibiotics piddock 2006 until now there is still some debate on the public health implications about the mdr efflux pumps because the presence of genes encoding efflux pump doesn t mean necessary expression of multidrug resistance martínez et al 2015 baral et al 2018 in terms of diversity a total of 888 arg subtypes were detected across all ecotypes ranging from 89 rs2 to 336 ck7 subtypes for each of sample among them 15 args were ubiquitous in all samples including 5 subtypes of multidrug resistance genes acrb mexk msba mtra and sav1866 2 mls macb and msrb 2 mupirocin iles and iles1 2 trimethoprim dfra3 and dfre nova aminocoumarin uppp bacitracin ksga kasugamycin and mfd quinolone relatively genes encoding macb uppp pmre polymyxin msrb sav1866 iles1 mfd ksga dfre and llma mls were the top 10 most abundant arg subtypes with an average abundance of more than 1 8 gb and totally contributed about 36 3 to the total arg coverage in additional 63 arg subtypes were identified in at least 75 samples figs s2 and 164 arg subtypes were detected with average coverage 0 1 gb these representative args mainly belonged to the genes against multidrug tetracycline mls aminoglycoside and beta lactam fig s3 and most of them have not been reported previously in this area luo et al 2010 qiao et al 2018 it should be noted the recently discovered plasmid borne colistin resistance gene mcr 1 was identified in all ecotypes this newly emerging gene can make bacteria resistant to colistin an old antibiotic that is the last resort drug for some multidrug resistant infections liu et al 2016 it was first reported on a plasmid in escherichia coli from porcine origin in china and detected throughout the world marathe et al 2017 pärnänen et al 2019 in general the mcr 1 gene was considered to be associated with the use of veterinary colistin however uncharacteristic detections were also reported for example in bulgaria that the high mcr 1 level was found in bulgarian poultry herds whereas bulgaria has a low reported usage of veterinary colistin munk et al 2018 the movement of mcr 1 onto a conjugative plasmid allows it to move from cell to cell resulting in its transfer in the environment meanwhile a range of carbapenemases such as ges vim kpc oxa and imp types were also detected in all of sample types including the river sediments it is not surprising previous study also reported several resistance genes to carbapenems in beijing smog metagenomes including ind ges imp oxa 50 oxa 51 and oxa 58 pal et al 2016 given the detections of mcr 1 and carbapenemases in various ecotypes in this area it is necessary to follow up with their risk assessment in the future interestingly our results about the arg compositions of stp influents table 1 were slightly different from the metagenomic analysis directly aligned the sequencing short reads against the snc ardb in which the top 3 most dominant arg types for the same metagenomic data set of influent sewage si1 si8 were genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside tetracycline and beta lactam su et al 2017 this is not surprising as the detection of args by utilizing sequence similarity search is still dependent on that the genes are present in the database bengtsson palme et al 2017 chen et al 2019 for example the number of non redundant reference sequences in the deeparg db 14 968 used in this study is about five times than the snc ardb 2998 yang et al 2013 on the other hand the assembled contigs with long enough sequences i e average length of 1142 bp in our analysis might provide more reliable annotation results on those args with long length arango argoty et al 2018 chen et al 2019 although no benchmark can be used as a reference at present database choice and longer sequences are critical when identifying args from complex environmental communities manish et al 2019 3 2 difference of arg profiles in the different ecotypes comparatively the compositions of arg types differed among the different ecotypes fig 2 for example apart from the args against multidrug mls and bacitracin the other top 3 dominant arg types were beta lactam tetracycline and aminoglycoside for stp influents polymyxin aminoglycoside and tetracycline for pig manures tetracycline aminoglycoside and trimethoprim for chicken manures aminoglycoside beta lactam and quinolone for stp wastes and quinolone trimethoprim and mupirocin for river sediments table 1 as another example four arg types conferring elfamycin tetracenomycin thiostrepton and tunicamycin were uniquely detected in the chicken manures further non metric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds demonstrated these differences that samples from the same ecotype clustered more closely adonis test permutations 999 adj p 0 05 fig s4 in general the difference of arg compositions was determined by multiple complex drivers including the selection pressures for antibiotics and other coselective agents li et al 2015a in the area distinctive consumption patterns of antibiotics and residues of antibiotics can be found in the various ecotypes tables s3 and s4 interestingly samples collected from the river sediments clustered more closely with those from the stp effluents sludge potentially showing a closer link of the arg profiles between them with regard to arg abundance significantly differences p value 0 05 of the total coverage of args were also observed between the river sediments and the other arg associated ecotypes except for stp wastes fig s5 relatively args were more abundant in stp influents 125 158 gb pig manures 116 147 gb and chicken manures 64 0 165 gb than stp wastes 35 1 124 gb and river sediments 26 3 84 5 gb and followed the order of stp influents pig manures chicken manures stp wastes river sediments suggesting that urban sewage and animal farms would be the hotspots of args in the area table 1 meanwhile t test showed that the total arg coverage in stp influents was significantly higher p value 0 001 than that in stp effluents sludge fig s5 likely indicating that the sewage treatment process in stps table s1 was effective in decreasing the levels of args to a great extent by reducing bacterial loads in the raw sewage yang et al 2013 karkman et al 2019 of the 888 detected arg subtypes 170 subtypes were identified as the ecotype shared args detected in at least one sample in each ecotype fig s6 high number of the shared arg subtypes was found among the sewage animal manures and river sediments suggesting frequent flow crossing habitat barriers although resistomes across habitats are generally related to the phylogeny of microbial populations along ecological gradients args can utilize mobile genetic elements mges to cross habitat boundaries causing a one health problem pehrsson et al 2016 regarding the common args between specific two ecotypes stp influents and stp effluents sludge shared most arg subtypes n 337 indicating that the conventional treatment process of sewage in stps was ineffective to reduce the diversity of args because a variety of args had high potential to pass the traditional treatment process of stps table s1 through reactivation and regrowth and even to increase as high bacterial abundance and diversity promoted horizontal gene transfer of args huang et al 2011 guo et al 2017 on the other hand differences of arg diversity were also observed among the different ecotypes fig 3 a much more arg subtypes were detected in the chicken manures n 570 and the sewage associated samples n 456 458 whereas much less detected in samples from the pig manures n 399 and river sediments n 366 table 1 meanwhile the chicken manures had high level of unique args n 144 followed by stp influents n 53 pig manures n 49 stp waste n 49 and river sediments n 46 fig s7 although least diversity and unique args were identified in the sediments of chaobai river attention still should be payed to its substantial potential for developing novel resistance forsberg et al 2014 because it has being impacted by continuous and strong anthropogenic activities heeb et al 2012 chen et al 2018a indeed class 1 integron inti1 were widely detected in the river sediments with a high level of abundance 6 9 12 4 gb significantly indicating anthropogenic pollution in this river gillings et al 2015 remarkably the chicken manures contained a higher arg diversity n 570 compared to the pig manures n 399 but the consumption volume of antibiotics for pig production was higher than that of chicken table s3 in addition to the background diversity of resistomes in chick gut microbiota enrichment of args might occur in the growing of chick previous studies also reported the arg enrichment of chick growth due to the complex mechanism of selection pressures resulting from multiple args and the co occurrence of mobile elements with their corresponding conferring resistance looft et al 2012 li et al 2015a however no arg enrichment was observed for pig on the contrary some arg types decreased greatly in the grown up pig jensen and hayes 2014 in fact similar results were also reported in nine european countries that the poultry resistome had a higher chao1 estimated richness than pig munk et al 2018 3 3 relationship between args and taxa based on the analysis results of kaiju 97 6 of the total annotated genes were assigned to bacteria while archaic and viral genes represented 0 8 and 0 5 of the annotated genes respectively at the phylum level proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes actinobacteria and cyanobacteria were the major phyla in the bacterial community fig s8 totally accounting for 69 98 of the total coverage for each sample relatively proteobacteria was the most abundant bacterial phylum in the samples for chicken manures stp influents stp effluents sludge and river sediments while firmicutes was the most abundant phylum in the pig manures at the genus level 1477 genera were assigned and the top 5 most abundant bacterial genera were bacteroides prevotella dechloromonas pseudomonas and candidatus accumulibacter mainly affiliating with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria fig s9 on average psychrobacter prevotella bacteroides and flavobacterium were identified as the most dominant bacterial genera in the samples for chicken manures pig manures stp influents and stp effluents sludge respectively while dechloromonas in the river sediments similarly distinctions of microbial community were also identified among the different ecotypes especially between the river sediments and animal manures stp influents adonis test p 0 05 with constrained ordination principal co ordinates analysis cpcoa obvious clustering of the bacterial genera was observed for most ecotypes fig 3b while the samples of river sediments were intermixed with stp waste samples as shown in fig 3 clustering pattern of the microbial taxa was similar to the arg compositions mantel s tests bray curtis suggested a significant correlation between the arg data and taxonomic data r 0 686 p 0 001 999 permutations meanwhile procrustes analysis based on the non metric multidimensional scaling analyses of arg profiles and bacterial genera profiles also demonstrated that the microbial community and arg compositions were correlated significantly m2 0 246 p 0 001 999 permutations these results potentially indicated that the microbial compositions could be used to identify the antibiotic resistance patterns and similarly the arg compositions could be employed to distinguish microbial community such as for tracking the source of fecal contamination in the environment baral et al 2018 however given the robust of statistical analysis the putative conclusion should be viewed with caution although previous studies also showed that the microbe and args were interrelated intrinsically because microbial community could be regarded as a gene sharing network via complex interactions including horizontal gene transfer in the environment hiltunen et al 2017 further network analysis was used to explore the detailed correlation between the major arg subtypes detected in at least 75 samples and the top most abundant bacteria assigned on the arg carrying contigs accs it should be noted herein the bacterial taxa at the species level were employed to construct the correlation matrix of network as the factors driving antibiotic resistance to transfer and enrich in microbial community are generally species specific bengtsson palme et al 2018 by utilizing a voting mechanism ma et al 2017 a total of 3662 bacterial species 73 8 of the total annotated species were assigned on the accs fig s10 shows the top 100 most abundant species potentially carrying various arg types mainly affiliating with multidrug mls and quinolone fig s11 unfortunately several antibiotic resistant pathogens in the who priority list were identified fig s12 including escherichia coli klebsiella pneumoniae acinetobacter baumannii staphylococcus aureus pseudomonas aeruginosa enterococcus faecium enterococcus faecalis and stenotrophomonas maltophilia tacconelli et al 2018 finally a strong correlation matrix spearman s ρ 0 7 p value 0 01 was derived from the major args fig s2 and the most dominant arg carrying species fig s11 to construct the co occurrence network of args and microbial taxa su et al 2017 as shown in fig s13 the co occurrence patterns were established between 108 bacterial species and 25 args and a connection represented the significant correlation between an arg subtype and a microbial species it can be seen that the most well connected args were the genes for pmre polymyxin bepe multidrug rosb polymyxin and mexk multidrug which were strongly correlated with 42 36 33 and 30 bacterial species respectively meanwhile a total of 73 species fig s14 were identified to take along multiple args among them silanimonas lenta arenimonas composti arenimonas donghaensis candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis lysobacter daejeonensis and roseburia hominis were the species that were correlated to more than five args both of them belong to proteobacteria phylum previous studies showed the correlations explored in network analysis could be used to identify the potential arg hosts which might be the pivotal hub bacteria to promote the spread and fate of args in the environment forsberg et al 2014 ma et al 2017 however the correlation between args and bacterial community still need to be further validated using function metagenomics li et al 2015a 3 4 microbial source tracking with crassphage annotation the crassphage genome was employed as mst marker for tracking source of fecal pollution in the river sediments as well as other four commonly used viral markers for comparison as shown in fig s15 except for crassphage the fecal bacteroides phage ɸb124 14 human adenovirus f hadv human polyomavirus bk hpyv and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov were not detected in the river sediments suggesting that these markers lacked field sensitivity to be used for tracking fecal pollution in this area not strangely the concentrations of virus such as hadv and hpyv were generally tended to be low because their occurrences always depend on the illness rates in community as well as the dilution of virus in river waters ahmed et al 2018 in contrast crassphage was widely identified in the river sediments 63 7 of samples and the sewage associated samples 100 but not in any samples from the chicken manures and pig manures 0 indicating that crassphage could overcome the limit of detection and had strong potential as a marker for tracking human fecal pollution in this study due to its highly host specificity 100 and host sensitivity 100 herein of the 11 metagenomic data set of river sediments 7 metagenomes had been identified with reads mapped to the crassphage genome and 5 metagenomes had at least 0 01 reads mapping as expected due to the high abundance of crassphage in human gut the stp influents had higher percentage of reads mapped to the crassphage genome average 4 26 than the stp effluents sludge 1 89 and the river sediments 0 13 meanwhile the result also meant the crassphage had been removed effectively by the sewage treatment process in most stps table s1 however exceptions were still observed for example with high percentage of reads mapped to the crassphage genome in sw7 10 6 sw9 3 36 and sw3 1 96 indicating low removal rates in these stps spearman correlation analysis showed the crassphage abundance correlated very strongly with the total arg abundance in the samples from stp influents and stp effluents sludge r2 0 745 adj p 0 001 suggesting the potential of crassphage based marker as an indicator of the presence of args in the sewage associated samples the regression model further confirmed this significant correlation linear regression f 9 41 adj r2 0 48 p 0 05 fig 4 interestingly the crassphage also positively correlated with the args r2 0 709 adj p 0 05 in the river sediments where fecal contamination may originate from multiple different sources potentially including sewage and animal manures indeed similar trends could also be observed between the crassphage and some specific arg types r2 0 625 0 825 adj p 0 05 in the river sediments such as args conferring resistance to multidrug and polymyxin fig s16 as a whole consistent and strong correlation between the args and crassphage suggested that the presence of args in the sediments of chaobai river could be potentially explained with the crassphage and was impacted largely by the extent of human fecal pollution in general args can be spread in bacterial community through horizontal gene transfer and bacteriophages may contribute to the spread of args through transduction stachler et al 2019 a recently published investigation by correlating the crassphage abundance and arg abundance with large scale analysis of metagenomes also showed similar results that crassphage had a potential to reveal selection dynamics in the environment and the arg abundances in anthropogenically impacted environments could be explained by human fecal pollution karkman et al 2019 on the other hand the crassphage was not detected in the four samples of river sediments rs4 rs5 rs9 and rs10 fig s15 suggesting very little human fecal material however abundant and diverse args were still identified in these sites fig s1 which might be explained by non human sources in general the increasing presence of args in the environment may be associated with multiple complex factors bengtsson palme et al 2018 particularly considering resistant bacterial pollution from human and animal feces since crassphage is rather specific to human feces ahmed et al 2018 here we also analysed another phage indictor ɸb124 14 which has been reported to be a good candidate for evaluating the combined effect of human and animal fecal pollution ogilvie et al 2018 unfortunately the ɸb124 14 was not detected in the four sediment samples due to its lower abundance in fecal material and or the dilution of water to disentangle the contribution of human and animal fecal pollution to the presence of args in the environment ideal markers for animal feces with field sensitivity and highly host specific are yet to be discovered in the future 3 5 source apportionment using metagenomic signatures further sourcetracker a machine learning classification tool which has been widely and successfully applied for microbial source tracking based on community profile knights et al 2011 baral et al 2018 liu et al 2018 was used to apportion quantitatively the presence of args in the river sediments contributed by potential sources including chicken manures pig manures stp influents and stp effluents sludge as mentioned above the different ecotypes had distinctive compositions of both microbial taxa and args adonis test permutations 999 adj p 0 01 fig 3 which suggested that the metagenomic signature with a multitude of genetic markers was unique to each sample moreover the machine learning classification could deemphasize the overlapped signatures occurring among training sets to minimize biases li et al 2018 in this study the results of cross validation with leave one out strategy suggested the sourcetracker could predict correctly corresponding ecotype of all samples 100 based on the broad spectrum profile of args at subtype level n 888 and the microbial profile at species level n 4709 indicating the applicability of sourcetracker for tracking arg sources as illustrated in fig 5 a stp effluents sludge was the most dominant contributor 81 6 92 1 of args in the sediments of chaobai river followed by stp influents 2 7 6 0 chicken manures 1 6 4 3 and pig manures 0 9 3 5 the contribution of args from unknown sources was estimated to be 1 2 12 3 meanwhile similar trends were also observed according to the sourcetracker analyses based on the microbial taxa fig 5b not strangely as stated above significant correlation was identified between the arg compositions and microbial community profiles in this study fig 3 which was in line with previous studies forsberg et al 2014 pehrsson et al 2016 herein stp effluents sludge and stp influents were also identified as the significant sources of microbes in the river sediments fig 5b with relative contributions of 49 3 68 1 2 5 19 6 respectively remarkably the contributions from chicken manures and pig manures were negligible while unknown sources accounted for 24 1 39 3 of the taxa in the river sediments suggesting a complex mixture of diverse microbial communities from other sources i e soil dwelling bacteria and or and other animals li et al 2018 overall sewage associated discharge was the largest contributor to the presence of args in the river sediments which was consistent with the above analyses that similar characteristics of both the arg compositions and microbial taxa were observed between the river sediments and stp effluents fig 3 fig s14 the results also suggested that stps would be a critical repository of args in the chaobai river largely due to the massive and continual discharge of sewage from the surrounding cities chen et al 2018a for example the total wastewater volume of beijing in 2013 was up to 1 55 billion tonnes xia 2013 although large amount of args in the influent would be removed by various sewage treatment process in stps the remaining args in effluent sludge might still entered into the river environment yang et al 2013 guo et al 2017 meanwhile antibiotic residues in the river environment table s4 further facilitated the maintenance and dissemination of resistome as well as other coselective agents unexpectedly here both chicken manures and pig manures had very limited contribution to the arg presence in the river sediments suggesting that little waste of livestock farms had entered the river in this area it might be explained that in the past years the city of beijing implemented a series of policies to promote the adjustment and upgrading of agricultural structure for protecting environment resulting in the closure or the strategic shift of livestock farms from the inner suburbs to the outer suburbs mountain area wei et al 2018 in addition the manure utilization rate of livestock farms was also requested to reach more than 90 to meet zero emission goals as a whole the apportionment results matched basically the regional environmental characteristics in this area 4 conclusions currently investigation on source identification of antibiotic resistome in the environment is still lacking this study comprehensively characterized the profilings of args in a peri urban river using high throughput sequencing based metagenomic analysis and systematically disentangled the source sink relationship of args by combining with a recently discovered crassphage bacteriophage with machine learning classification sourcetracker our results showed crassphage was a good marker for tracking human fecal pollution in the study area due to its highly host specificity and host sensitivity and the presence of args in the river sediments might be largely impacted by the extent of sewage associated fecal pollution in quantitative apportionment the analyses of sourcetracker demonstrated that sewage associated activities influent and effluent sludge dominated 84 3 98 1 of the relative contribution for args in the river sediments to protect the important river in beijing tianjin hebei area from arg contamination for reducing the health risk of args policy and guidance should focus on controlling the irregular discharges of domestic sewage especially in suburban areas and improving of the treatment efficiency for antibiotics and resistant bacteria in stps declaration of

18438,antimicrobial resistance is a growing public health concern and environment is regarded as an important reservoir and dissemination route for antibiotic resistance genes args to prevent and control arg pollution it is essential to correctly disentangle source sink relationship of args in the environment however accurately apportioning sources of args is still a big challenge due to the complex interaction of multiple sources and contaminants in the environment with changing dynamics in this study we addressed this problem and focused on identifying the potential sources of args in a peri urban river by jointly utilizing two novel microbial source tracking methods to attain the objective sediment water samples were collected from the peri urban river and four arg associated ecotypes including effluents of sewage treatment plants stps stp influent chicken manures and pig manures the high throughput profilings of args and microbial taxa in the river sediments and the four ecotypes were comprehensively characterized in combination of shotgun sequencing and metagenomic assembly analysis crassphage a recently discovered dna bacteriophage was employed to track the impact of human fecal pollution on args in the river sediments further sourcetracker a machine learning classification tool was used for quantifying the contributions of potential sources to args in the river sediments based on the metagenomic signatures of args and microbial taxa in total 888 arg subtypes belonging to 29 arg types were detected across all samples including mcr 1 and a range of carbapenemases types statistical analyses suggested different ecotypes generally had distinct profiles of both args and microbial taxa while the arg compositions were significantly correlated with the microbial community source tracking with crassphage showed the presence of args in the river sediments might be largely impacted by the extent of human fecal pollution which was also confirmed by the analyses of sourcetracker that the discharge from stps was the largest contributor of args 81 6 92 1 and microbes 49 3 68 1 in the river sediments results of the study can help us to better understand the characterization of args in the peri urban ecosystem and to design effective prevention and control strategies for reducing arg dissemination keywords antibiotic resistance genes source identification metagenomic assembly microbial source tracking crassphage sourcetracker 1 introduction antimicrobial resistance is a growing threat to global public health in particular misuse and abuse of antibiotics in community clinical and agricultural settings in the past several decades zhang et al 2015 klein et al 2018 have being accelerated the prevalence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args in the environment zhu et al 2017 karkman et al 2019 recently concerns have being increased over the role of environment as an important reservoir and dissemination route for args bengtsson palme et al 2018 qiao et al 2018 in this realm reliable information that accurately characterizes the occurrence source and fate of args in the environment is particularly important to address the challenge of antimicrobial resistance for health risk assessment and mitigation strategy designment pruden et al 2013 larsson et al 2018 however the presence of args in the environment is a complex problem associated with multiple and interconnected drivers hendriksen et al 2019 and generally entangles our understanding on the origin and transmission of args especially in the highly human impacted environment the peri urban rivers are one of the critical interfaces of urban rural symbiosis ecosystems zheng et al 2018 they not only provide water resource for urban and rural residents but also may be used for more ecosystem services such as agricultural irrigation ecological landscape and recreational purposes unfortunately with the rapid development of industrialization and modernization peri urban rivers receive massive waste potentially containing resistant bacteria and selection pressures for args i e antibiotics metals and biocides from a variety of urban and rural pollution sources such as effluents from sewage treatment plants stps urine manures from livestock farms runoff from fields treated with manures or biosolids and even raw domestic sewage due to sanitary sewer pipeline leakage novo et al 2013 woolhouse and ward 2013 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 su et al 2017 baral et al 2018 munk et al 2018 wang et al 2019 indeed the peri urban rivers appear to be a significant reservoir of args in the environment he et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 in general peri urban rivers are close to human beings thus args in the rivers may be re recruited into the human associated resistome through mobile genetic elements bengtsson palme et al 2018 resulting in health risk to the general public to prevent and control the arg pollution in peri urban rivers it is essential to correctly identify the potential sources of args and quantitatively apportion their contributions however as stated above accurately disentangling the source sink relationship of args is still a challenging topic due to the complex interaction of multiple sources and contaminants i e autochthonous and allochthonous resistant bacteria in the environment with changing dynamics as well as the distinctive dissemination mechanisms of args in difference sources point and non point sources larsson et al 2018 li et al 2018 although some investigations reported the occurrence and distribution of args in urban peri urban rivers and discussed the impact of human activities on arg level luo et al 2010 pruden et al 2012 marathe et al 2017 baral et al 2018 few studies focusing on the source apportionment of args in urban peri urban rivers could be found until now recently two novel tools have been developed and proposed for microbial source tracking mst crassphage and sourcetracker crassphage is a bacteriophage that was reported to be highly abundant and host specific in the human feces and sewage dutilh et al 2014 stachler and bibby 2014 and has been successfully applied for sewage pollution tracking in the environment ahmed et al 2018 kongprajug et al 2019 interestingly studies also reported the co occurrence of crassphage and args in the environment indicating the potential of crassphage as an indicator to be employed for tracking arg sources karkman et al 2019 stachler et al 2019 sourcetracker is a machine learning classification tool and can be used to infer the mixing proportion of sources in a sink sample with community based profiling knights et al 2011 liu et al 2018 in contrast to the single marker method for mst i e crassphage the community based sourcetracker can characterize simultaneously a multitude of different genetic markers moreover to be used for quantitatively apportioning the contribution proportions from potential sources to the sink environment knights et al 2011 liu et al 2018 li et al 2018 baral et al 2018 in this study we addressed source identification of args in a peri urban river in beijing china by jointly utilizing the two novel mst methods to attain the study objective sediment water samples were collected from the peri urban river and four arg associated ecotypes within the study area including stp effluents stp influents chicken manures and pig manures the high throughput profilings of args and microbial taxa in these samples were comprehensively characterized in combination of shotgun sequencing and metagenomic assembly analysis and the relationship of args with hosts was explored by making use of the arg carrying contigs accs in metagenomic data subsequently crassphage was employed to track the impact of human fecal pollution on args in the river sediments and sourcetracker was used for quantifying the contribution proportions of potential sources to args in the river sediments based on the metagenomic signatures of args and microbial taxa the study will advance our knowledge about the args characteristics in peri urban rivers and help policy makers to design targeted strategies for the prevention and control of arg dissemination 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the chaobai river in beijing fig 1 with a drainage area of 19 500 km2 the chaobai river is a major tributary of the hai river system which is one of the seven largest river basins in china and is a typical peri urban river it originates from north of yanshan mountain flows through hebei beijing tianjin and finally discharges into the bohai sea in this area it is characterized by hot humid summers and generally cold windy dry winters and dominated by the continental temperate monsoon climate with an annual temperature 11 5 c the average precipitation is about 660 mm a highly concentrated from june to september the river not only is the main source of drinking water for megacity beijing but also provides valuable water resource for agricultural irrigation within the basin drainage region however the drastic development of urbanization and modernization in this area especially over the past several decades has made a serious eco environmental challenge on the chaobai river and other peri urban rivers in the jingjinji zone including the pollution problems of micropollutants and emerging contaminants heeb et al 2012 xia 2013 chen et al 2018a 2019 wei et al 2018 2 2 sample collection and public metagenomic datasets collection the surficial river sediments top 5 cm layer were sampled in november 2018 within consecutive days without recent rainfall along the chaobai river fig 1 meanwhile various samples were also collected from four arg associated ecotypes within the study area including three pig farms four chicken farms and seven conventional stps table s1 on each of the pig and chicken farm two manure samples were taken by randomly collecting fresh feces from different compartments or houses of animals at each sampling location three subsamples were collected from the floor and mixed thoroughly into one composite sample for obtaining a minimum of 10 g feces per sample for effluents 2 l water samples were collected from the outlet of each stp in all a total number of 32 samples were collected from the study area including river sediments rs1 rs11 n 11 pig manures pg1 pg6 n 6 chicken manures ck1 ck8 n 8 and stp effluents sw1 sw7 n 7 all samples were stored in sterile plastic containers immediately kept in a refrigerator at 4 c and transported to the laboratory within 24 h in laboratory effluent samples collected from the stps were filtered through 0 45 μm nitrocellulose filters the filters were frozen at 80 c until dna extraction as well as the manure and sediment samples meanwhile the concentrations of antibiotics in sampling sites were considered to understand the characteristics of selection pressure for different sample ecotypes text s1 in addition 10 metagenomics datasets collected in beijing guo et al 2017 su et al 2017 including stp influents si1 si8 n 8 and sludge sw8 sw9 n 2 were downloaded from the ncbi sra details about the dataset used in this study were summarized in table s2 2 3 dna extraction and shotgun metagenomic sequencing according to the manufacturer s instructions total dna was extracted for each sample using a tianamp dna kit for soil tiangen biotech china dna quality was evaluated using gel electrophoresis 1 agarose and its concentration was determined with qubit dsdna assay kit in qubit 2 0 flurometer life technologies usa the high quality dna for each sample 1 μg was used to construct sequencing libraries 350 bp paired end by utilizing nebnext ultra dna library prep kit for illumina neb usa and shotgun sequencing was performed on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform using the sequencing strategy of 150 bp paired end 2 4 metagenomic assembly and open reading frame prediction the raw metagenomic sequences of samples collected from the study area n 32 and the downloaded public metagenomic data n 10 were both filtered using fastp v0 19 5 chen et al 2018b to remove the reads containing low quality sequences in all approximately 6 0 gb of clean data was obtained for each sample resulting in a total of 254 gb data output for further analysis table s2 subsequently the clean reads for each sample were assembled separately using megahit v1 1 2 set as presets meta large to obtain scaftigs li et al 2015b further the scaftigs generated from the assembly were filtered to remove those shorter than 500 bp and were used to predict open reading frames orfs with metaprodigal v2 6 3 set as p meta hyatt et al 2012 then the predicted orfs longer than 100 nt were clustered using cd hit software v4 6 8 to generate a non redundant gene catalogue for downstream analysis under a criterion of 95 identity over 90 of the shorter orf length set as c 0 95 g 0 as 0 9 g 1 d 0 li and godzik 2006 in total about 10 2 million contigs average length 1142 bp were assembled to be used for orf prediction resulting in about 12 1 million non redundant genes table s2 2 5 arg and taxonomic annotations the predicted protein sequences of orfs were aligned against the deeparg db database which is a recent release of manually curated arg database and expands the repertoire of args currently accessible for metagenomic analysis of environment datasets with a high degree of confidence arango argoty et al 2018 the alignment was performed using blastp implemented in the diamond v0 9 17 118 buchfink et al 2015 with e value cutoff of 1e 10 an orf was annotated as arg like sequence if the blastp alignments exceeded 50 identity over 70 of the query coverages arango argoty et al 2018 on the other hand taxonomic annotation of the orfs was conducted using a novel metagenome classifier kaiju v1 6 3 menzel et al 2016 in which reads were searched for maximum exact matches against the progenomes database mende et al 2017 at the protein level with the burrows wheeler transform 2 6 crassphage annotation the crassphage genome accession nc 024711 1 was downloaded from ncbi and indexed using bowtie2 for subsequent mapping v2 3 4 3 langmead and salzberg 2012 then the quality processed metagenomic reads were mapped against the crassphage genome using bowtie2 and the coverage of crassphage genome was calculated using samtools v1 9 li et al 2009 for comparison other two phage genomes and three virus genomes including phage crass001 mh675552 1 phage ɸb124 14 he608841 1 pepper mild mottle virus nc 003630 1 human adenovirus f nc 001454 and human polyomavirus jc nc 001699 1 were also downloaded and done exactly as with crassphage because both of them were reported in previous studies as potential indictors of fecal pollution rachmadi et al 2016 ogilvie et al 2018 shkoporov et al 2018 gyawali et al 2019 2 7 source tracker analysis the machine learning classification tool sourcetracker v1 0 1 knights et al 2011 was employed to apportion the relative contribution of args from the four arg associated ecotypes to the river sediments including stp influents stp effluents sludge pig feces and chicken feces the sourcetracker utilizes a bayesian classification model together with gibbs sampling to compare the metagenomic signatures i e broad spectrum arg profiling or microbial community fingerprint in the source environments to those in the sink environments for estimating the extent of contribution of each source to the sink liu et al 2018 baral et al 2018 to reduce the effect of false predictions five independent runs were performed for each sourcetracker analysis using default settings 2 8 statistical and network analyses several statistical tools mainly including adonis test pearson correlation analysis procrustes analysis non metric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds and constrained ordination principal co ordinates analysis cpcoa were used to investigate the correlations or differences between args taxa and samples network analysis was employed to explore the co occurrence of args and microbial community based on their strong and significant correlation matrixes spearman s ρ 0 7 p value 0 01 su et al 2017 all the statistical analyses were conducted in the open source software r v3 5 2 by utilizing several r packages including car gunifrac and vegan network visualization was performed using gephi v0 9 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence composition and diversity of args in this study various samples were collected from the peri urban river sink n 11 and four arg associated ecotypes source n 31 within the study area for disentangling the source sink relationship of args to explore the critical factor of resistome dissemination in the environment after sequencing and assembly 42 metagenomic datasets were aligned against the deeparg db reference database to identify and classify the arg like orfs according to the structured arg resource to make all metagenomes comparable the coverage of the identified args was normalized to the size of each metagenomic dataset in units of times per giga base gb and the abundance of a particular arg type or subtype was calculated by summing the coverages of the identified arg sequences belonging to the that arg type or subtype xiong et al 2018 in total 29 of all 30 arg types included in the deeparg db were detected in at least one of the 42 samples fig s1 with the top 3 most abundant types against multidrug macrolide lincosamide streptogramin mls and bacitracin as expected the args associated with the commonly used antibiotics such as sulfonamide tetracycline quinolone trimethoprim and beta lactam table s3 were widespread across all of sample types fig s1 in particular multidrug resistance mdr was identified as the most abundant type in most of the samples table 1 largely due to the ubiquity of mdr efflux pumps in prokaryotes pearson correlation analysis showed the coverage of multidrug resistance genes was positively correlated with the total arg coverage r 2 0 841 p value 0 05 however genes encoding mdr efflux pumps are usually located on the chromosomes and may not have evolved originally to confer resistance against antibiotics piddock 2006 until now there is still some debate on the public health implications about the mdr efflux pumps because the presence of genes encoding efflux pump doesn t mean necessary expression of multidrug resistance martínez et al 2015 baral et al 2018 in terms of diversity a total of 888 arg subtypes were detected across all ecotypes ranging from 89 rs2 to 336 ck7 subtypes for each of sample among them 15 args were ubiquitous in all samples including 5 subtypes of multidrug resistance genes acrb mexk msba mtra and sav1866 2 mls macb and msrb 2 mupirocin iles and iles1 2 trimethoprim dfra3 and dfre nova aminocoumarin uppp bacitracin ksga kasugamycin and mfd quinolone relatively genes encoding macb uppp pmre polymyxin msrb sav1866 iles1 mfd ksga dfre and llma mls were the top 10 most abundant arg subtypes with an average abundance of more than 1 8 gb and totally contributed about 36 3 to the total arg coverage in additional 63 arg subtypes were identified in at least 75 samples figs s2 and 164 arg subtypes were detected with average coverage 0 1 gb these representative args mainly belonged to the genes against multidrug tetracycline mls aminoglycoside and beta lactam fig s3 and most of them have not been reported previously in this area luo et al 2010 qiao et al 2018 it should be noted the recently discovered plasmid borne colistin resistance gene mcr 1 was identified in all ecotypes this newly emerging gene can make bacteria resistant to colistin an old antibiotic that is the last resort drug for some multidrug resistant infections liu et al 2016 it was first reported on a plasmid in escherichia coli from porcine origin in china and detected throughout the world marathe et al 2017 pärnänen et al 2019 in general the mcr 1 gene was considered to be associated with the use of veterinary colistin however uncharacteristic detections were also reported for example in bulgaria that the high mcr 1 level was found in bulgarian poultry herds whereas bulgaria has a low reported usage of veterinary colistin munk et al 2018 the movement of mcr 1 onto a conjugative plasmid allows it to move from cell to cell resulting in its transfer in the environment meanwhile a range of carbapenemases such as ges vim kpc oxa and imp types were also detected in all of sample types including the river sediments it is not surprising previous study also reported several resistance genes to carbapenems in beijing smog metagenomes including ind ges imp oxa 50 oxa 51 and oxa 58 pal et al 2016 given the detections of mcr 1 and carbapenemases in various ecotypes in this area it is necessary to follow up with their risk assessment in the future interestingly our results about the arg compositions of stp influents table 1 were slightly different from the metagenomic analysis directly aligned the sequencing short reads against the snc ardb in which the top 3 most dominant arg types for the same metagenomic data set of influent sewage si1 si8 were genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside tetracycline and beta lactam su et al 2017 this is not surprising as the detection of args by utilizing sequence similarity search is still dependent on that the genes are present in the database bengtsson palme et al 2017 chen et al 2019 for example the number of non redundant reference sequences in the deeparg db 14 968 used in this study is about five times than the snc ardb 2998 yang et al 2013 on the other hand the assembled contigs with long enough sequences i e average length of 1142 bp in our analysis might provide more reliable annotation results on those args with long length arango argoty et al 2018 chen et al 2019 although no benchmark can be used as a reference at present database choice and longer sequences are critical when identifying args from complex environmental communities manish et al 2019 3 2 difference of arg profiles in the different ecotypes comparatively the compositions of arg types differed among the different ecotypes fig 2 for example apart from the args against multidrug mls and bacitracin the other top 3 dominant arg types were beta lactam tetracycline and aminoglycoside for stp influents polymyxin aminoglycoside and tetracycline for pig manures tetracycline aminoglycoside and trimethoprim for chicken manures aminoglycoside beta lactam and quinolone for stp wastes and quinolone trimethoprim and mupirocin for river sediments table 1 as another example four arg types conferring elfamycin tetracenomycin thiostrepton and tunicamycin were uniquely detected in the chicken manures further non metric multidimensional scaling analysis nmds demonstrated these differences that samples from the same ecotype clustered more closely adonis test permutations 999 adj p 0 05 fig s4 in general the difference of arg compositions was determined by multiple complex drivers including the selection pressures for antibiotics and other coselective agents li et al 2015a in the area distinctive consumption patterns of antibiotics and residues of antibiotics can be found in the various ecotypes tables s3 and s4 interestingly samples collected from the river sediments clustered more closely with those from the stp effluents sludge potentially showing a closer link of the arg profiles between them with regard to arg abundance significantly differences p value 0 05 of the total coverage of args were also observed between the river sediments and the other arg associated ecotypes except for stp wastes fig s5 relatively args were more abundant in stp influents 125 158 gb pig manures 116 147 gb and chicken manures 64 0 165 gb than stp wastes 35 1 124 gb and river sediments 26 3 84 5 gb and followed the order of stp influents pig manures chicken manures stp wastes river sediments suggesting that urban sewage and animal farms would be the hotspots of args in the area table 1 meanwhile t test showed that the total arg coverage in stp influents was significantly higher p value 0 001 than that in stp effluents sludge fig s5 likely indicating that the sewage treatment process in stps table s1 was effective in decreasing the levels of args to a great extent by reducing bacterial loads in the raw sewage yang et al 2013 karkman et al 2019 of the 888 detected arg subtypes 170 subtypes were identified as the ecotype shared args detected in at least one sample in each ecotype fig s6 high number of the shared arg subtypes was found among the sewage animal manures and river sediments suggesting frequent flow crossing habitat barriers although resistomes across habitats are generally related to the phylogeny of microbial populations along ecological gradients args can utilize mobile genetic elements mges to cross habitat boundaries causing a one health problem pehrsson et al 2016 regarding the common args between specific two ecotypes stp influents and stp effluents sludge shared most arg subtypes n 337 indicating that the conventional treatment process of sewage in stps was ineffective to reduce the diversity of args because a variety of args had high potential to pass the traditional treatment process of stps table s1 through reactivation and regrowth and even to increase as high bacterial abundance and diversity promoted horizontal gene transfer of args huang et al 2011 guo et al 2017 on the other hand differences of arg diversity were also observed among the different ecotypes fig 3 a much more arg subtypes were detected in the chicken manures n 570 and the sewage associated samples n 456 458 whereas much less detected in samples from the pig manures n 399 and river sediments n 366 table 1 meanwhile the chicken manures had high level of unique args n 144 followed by stp influents n 53 pig manures n 49 stp waste n 49 and river sediments n 46 fig s7 although least diversity and unique args were identified in the sediments of chaobai river attention still should be payed to its substantial potential for developing novel resistance forsberg et al 2014 because it has being impacted by continuous and strong anthropogenic activities heeb et al 2012 chen et al 2018a indeed class 1 integron inti1 were widely detected in the river sediments with a high level of abundance 6 9 12 4 gb significantly indicating anthropogenic pollution in this river gillings et al 2015 remarkably the chicken manures contained a higher arg diversity n 570 compared to the pig manures n 399 but the consumption volume of antibiotics for pig production was higher than that of chicken table s3 in addition to the background diversity of resistomes in chick gut microbiota enrichment of args might occur in the growing of chick previous studies also reported the arg enrichment of chick growth due to the complex mechanism of selection pressures resulting from multiple args and the co occurrence of mobile elements with their corresponding conferring resistance looft et al 2012 li et al 2015a however no arg enrichment was observed for pig on the contrary some arg types decreased greatly in the grown up pig jensen and hayes 2014 in fact similar results were also reported in nine european countries that the poultry resistome had a higher chao1 estimated richness than pig munk et al 2018 3 3 relationship between args and taxa based on the analysis results of kaiju 97 6 of the total annotated genes were assigned to bacteria while archaic and viral genes represented 0 8 and 0 5 of the annotated genes respectively at the phylum level proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes actinobacteria and cyanobacteria were the major phyla in the bacterial community fig s8 totally accounting for 69 98 of the total coverage for each sample relatively proteobacteria was the most abundant bacterial phylum in the samples for chicken manures stp influents stp effluents sludge and river sediments while firmicutes was the most abundant phylum in the pig manures at the genus level 1477 genera were assigned and the top 5 most abundant bacterial genera were bacteroides prevotella dechloromonas pseudomonas and candidatus accumulibacter mainly affiliating with bacteroidetes and proteobacteria fig s9 on average psychrobacter prevotella bacteroides and flavobacterium were identified as the most dominant bacterial genera in the samples for chicken manures pig manures stp influents and stp effluents sludge respectively while dechloromonas in the river sediments similarly distinctions of microbial community were also identified among the different ecotypes especially between the river sediments and animal manures stp influents adonis test p 0 05 with constrained ordination principal co ordinates analysis cpcoa obvious clustering of the bacterial genera was observed for most ecotypes fig 3b while the samples of river sediments were intermixed with stp waste samples as shown in fig 3 clustering pattern of the microbial taxa was similar to the arg compositions mantel s tests bray curtis suggested a significant correlation between the arg data and taxonomic data r 0 686 p 0 001 999 permutations meanwhile procrustes analysis based on the non metric multidimensional scaling analyses of arg profiles and bacterial genera profiles also demonstrated that the microbial community and arg compositions were correlated significantly m2 0 246 p 0 001 999 permutations these results potentially indicated that the microbial compositions could be used to identify the antibiotic resistance patterns and similarly the arg compositions could be employed to distinguish microbial community such as for tracking the source of fecal contamination in the environment baral et al 2018 however given the robust of statistical analysis the putative conclusion should be viewed with caution although previous studies also showed that the microbe and args were interrelated intrinsically because microbial community could be regarded as a gene sharing network via complex interactions including horizontal gene transfer in the environment hiltunen et al 2017 further network analysis was used to explore the detailed correlation between the major arg subtypes detected in at least 75 samples and the top most abundant bacteria assigned on the arg carrying contigs accs it should be noted herein the bacterial taxa at the species level were employed to construct the correlation matrix of network as the factors driving antibiotic resistance to transfer and enrich in microbial community are generally species specific bengtsson palme et al 2018 by utilizing a voting mechanism ma et al 2017 a total of 3662 bacterial species 73 8 of the total annotated species were assigned on the accs fig s10 shows the top 100 most abundant species potentially carrying various arg types mainly affiliating with multidrug mls and quinolone fig s11 unfortunately several antibiotic resistant pathogens in the who priority list were identified fig s12 including escherichia coli klebsiella pneumoniae acinetobacter baumannii staphylococcus aureus pseudomonas aeruginosa enterococcus faecium enterococcus faecalis and stenotrophomonas maltophilia tacconelli et al 2018 finally a strong correlation matrix spearman s ρ 0 7 p value 0 01 was derived from the major args fig s2 and the most dominant arg carrying species fig s11 to construct the co occurrence network of args and microbial taxa su et al 2017 as shown in fig s13 the co occurrence patterns were established between 108 bacterial species and 25 args and a connection represented the significant correlation between an arg subtype and a microbial species it can be seen that the most well connected args were the genes for pmre polymyxin bepe multidrug rosb polymyxin and mexk multidrug which were strongly correlated with 42 36 33 and 30 bacterial species respectively meanwhile a total of 73 species fig s14 were identified to take along multiple args among them silanimonas lenta arenimonas composti arenimonas donghaensis candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis lysobacter daejeonensis and roseburia hominis were the species that were correlated to more than five args both of them belong to proteobacteria phylum previous studies showed the correlations explored in network analysis could be used to identify the potential arg hosts which might be the pivotal hub bacteria to promote the spread and fate of args in the environment forsberg et al 2014 ma et al 2017 however the correlation between args and bacterial community still need to be further validated using function metagenomics li et al 2015a 3 4 microbial source tracking with crassphage annotation the crassphage genome was employed as mst marker for tracking source of fecal pollution in the river sediments as well as other four commonly used viral markers for comparison as shown in fig s15 except for crassphage the fecal bacteroides phage ɸb124 14 human adenovirus f hadv human polyomavirus bk hpyv and pepper mild mottle virus pmmov were not detected in the river sediments suggesting that these markers lacked field sensitivity to be used for tracking fecal pollution in this area not strangely the concentrations of virus such as hadv and hpyv were generally tended to be low because their occurrences always depend on the illness rates in community as well as the dilution of virus in river waters ahmed et al 2018 in contrast crassphage was widely identified in the river sediments 63 7 of samples and the sewage associated samples 100 but not in any samples from the chicken manures and pig manures 0 indicating that crassphage could overcome the limit of detection and had strong potential as a marker for tracking human fecal pollution in this study due to its highly host specificity 100 and host sensitivity 100 herein of the 11 metagenomic data set of river sediments 7 metagenomes had been identified with reads mapped to the crassphage genome and 5 metagenomes had at least 0 01 reads mapping as expected due to the high abundance of crassphage in human gut the stp influents had higher percentage of reads mapped to the crassphage genome average 4 26 than the stp effluents sludge 1 89 and the river sediments 0 13 meanwhile the result also meant the crassphage had been removed effectively by the sewage treatment process in most stps table s1 however exceptions were still observed for example with high percentage of reads mapped to the crassphage genome in sw7 10 6 sw9 3 36 and sw3 1 96 indicating low removal rates in these stps spearman correlation analysis showed the crassphage abundance correlated very strongly with the total arg abundance in the samples from stp influents and stp effluents sludge r2 0 745 adj p 0 001 suggesting the potential of crassphage based marker as an indicator of the presence of args in the sewage associated samples the regression model further confirmed this significant correlation linear regression f 9 41 adj r2 0 48 p 0 05 fig 4 interestingly the crassphage also positively correlated with the args r2 0 709 adj p 0 05 in the river sediments where fecal contamination may originate from multiple different sources potentially including sewage and animal manures indeed similar trends could also be observed between the crassphage and some specific arg types r2 0 625 0 825 adj p 0 05 in the river sediments such as args conferring resistance to multidrug and polymyxin fig s16 as a whole consistent and strong correlation between the args and crassphage suggested that the presence of args in the sediments of chaobai river could be potentially explained with the crassphage and was impacted largely by the extent of human fecal pollution in general args can be spread in bacterial community through horizontal gene transfer and bacteriophages may contribute to the spread of args through transduction stachler et al 2019 a recently published investigation by correlating the crassphage abundance and arg abundance with large scale analysis of metagenomes also showed similar results that crassphage had a potential to reveal selection dynamics in the environment and the arg abundances in anthropogenically impacted environments could be explained by human fecal pollution karkman et al 2019 on the other hand the crassphage was not detected in the four samples of river sediments rs4 rs5 rs9 and rs10 fig s15 suggesting very little human fecal material however abundant and diverse args were still identified in these sites fig s1 which might be explained by non human sources in general the increasing presence of args in the environment may be associated with multiple complex factors bengtsson palme et al 2018 particularly considering resistant bacterial pollution from human and animal feces since crassphage is rather specific to human feces ahmed et al 2018 here we also analysed another phage indictor ɸb124 14 which has been reported to be a good candidate for evaluating the combined effect of human and animal fecal pollution ogilvie et al 2018 unfortunately the ɸb124 14 was not detected in the four sediment samples due to its lower abundance in fecal material and or the dilution of water to disentangle the contribution of human and animal fecal pollution to the presence of args in the environment ideal markers for animal feces with field sensitivity and highly host specific are yet to be discovered in the future 3 5 source apportionment using metagenomic signatures further sourcetracker a machine learning classification tool which has been widely and successfully applied for microbial source tracking based on community profile knights et al 2011 baral et al 2018 liu et al 2018 was used to apportion quantitatively the presence of args in the river sediments contributed by potential sources including chicken manures pig manures stp influents and stp effluents sludge as mentioned above the different ecotypes had distinctive compositions of both microbial taxa and args adonis test permutations 999 adj p 0 01 fig 3 which suggested that the metagenomic signature with a multitude of genetic markers was unique to each sample moreover the machine learning classification could deemphasize the overlapped signatures occurring among training sets to minimize biases li et al 2018 in this study the results of cross validation with leave one out strategy suggested the sourcetracker could predict correctly corresponding ecotype of all samples 100 based on the broad spectrum profile of args at subtype level n 888 and the microbial profile at species level n 4709 indicating the applicability of sourcetracker for tracking arg sources as illustrated in fig 5 a stp effluents sludge was the most dominant contributor 81 6 92 1 of args in the sediments of chaobai river followed by stp influents 2 7 6 0 chicken manures 1 6 4 3 and pig manures 0 9 3 5 the contribution of args from unknown sources was estimated to be 1 2 12 3 meanwhile similar trends were also observed according to the sourcetracker analyses based on the microbial taxa fig 5b not strangely as stated above significant correlation was identified between the arg compositions and microbial community profiles in this study fig 3 which was in line with previous studies forsberg et al 2014 pehrsson et al 2016 herein stp effluents sludge and stp influents were also identified as the significant sources of microbes in the river sediments fig 5b with relative contributions of 49 3 68 1 2 5 19 6 respectively remarkably the contributions from chicken manures and pig manures were negligible while unknown sources accounted for 24 1 39 3 of the taxa in the river sediments suggesting a complex mixture of diverse microbial communities from other sources i e soil dwelling bacteria and or and other animals li et al 2018 overall sewage associated discharge was the largest contributor to the presence of args in the river sediments which was consistent with the above analyses that similar characteristics of both the arg compositions and microbial taxa were observed between the river sediments and stp effluents fig 3 fig s14 the results also suggested that stps would be a critical repository of args in the chaobai river largely due to the massive and continual discharge of sewage from the surrounding cities chen et al 2018a for example the total wastewater volume of beijing in 2013 was up to 1 55 billion tonnes xia 2013 although large amount of args in the influent would be removed by various sewage treatment process in stps the remaining args in effluent sludge might still entered into the river environment yang et al 2013 guo et al 2017 meanwhile antibiotic residues in the river environment table s4 further facilitated the maintenance and dissemination of resistome as well as other coselective agents unexpectedly here both chicken manures and pig manures had very limited contribution to the arg presence in the river sediments suggesting that little waste of livestock farms had entered the river in this area it might be explained that in the past years the city of beijing implemented a series of policies to promote the adjustment and upgrading of agricultural structure for protecting environment resulting in the closure or the strategic shift of livestock farms from the inner suburbs to the outer suburbs mountain area wei et al 2018 in addition the manure utilization rate of livestock farms was also requested to reach more than 90 to meet zero emission goals as a whole the apportionment results matched basically the regional environmental characteristics in this area 4 conclusions currently investigation on source identification of antibiotic resistome in the environment is still lacking this study comprehensively characterized the profilings of args in a peri urban river using high throughput sequencing based metagenomic analysis and systematically disentangled the source sink relationship of args by combining with a recently discovered crassphage bacteriophage with machine learning classification sourcetracker our results showed crassphage was a good marker for tracking human fecal pollution in the study area due to its highly host specificity and host sensitivity and the presence of args in the river sediments might be largely impacted by the extent of sewage associated fecal pollution in quantitative apportionment the analyses of sourcetracker demonstrated that sewage associated activities influent and effluent sludge dominated 84 3 98 1 of the relative contribution for args in the river sediments to protect the important river in beijing tianjin hebei area from arg contamination for reducing the health risk of args policy and guidance should focus on controlling the irregular discharges of domestic sewage especially in suburban areas and improving of the treatment efficiency for antibiotics and resistant bacteria in stps declaration of

18439,artificial sweeteners ass have been frequently detected in aquatic environment and are of emerging concern due to their environmental persistence acesulfame ace and sucralose suc are two ass that are difficult to remove the ultraviolet persulfate uv ps advanced oxidation process has been proven to remove ass in real wastewater effectively in this study radical based degradation kinetic model pathways and toxicity evaluation of ass by uv ps process were explored ace and suc were effectively removed by uv ps process and uv photolysis hydroxyl radicals ho and sulfate radicals so4 contributes the degradation of ass a kinetic prediction model for ass degradation was established based on the second order rate constants with ho and so4 and the steady state concentrations of ho and so4 were calculated through the degradations of two reference compounds the kinetic model could predict the degradation process of ass in five real wastewaters effluents furthermore two models based on the kinetic and the water matrices parameters for ass degradation in wastewater were compared finally the tentative pathways of ass degradations by uv ps were proposed also toxicity evaluation showed that ass after uv ps treatment enhanced the toxicity on c carpio liver and prolongation of treatment time and recovery in fresh water can reduce the toxicity on c carpio graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv persulfate artificial sweeteners kinetic predicting model degradation pathway toxicity 1 introduction artificial sweeteners ass are popular sugar substitutes used in food beverages confectionary pharmaceuticals and personal care products lin et al 2017 the occurrence fate and removal of ass in aquatic environment have drawn great attention during the last decade scheurer et al 2009 among the ass which have been regarded as contaminants of emerging concern acesulfame ace and sucralose suc are frequently detected in seawater mead et al 2009 surface water scheurer et al 2011 groundwater van stempvoort et al 2013 and wastewater li et al 2018 the concentrations of ace and suc can even reach 1 0 and 15 μg l 1 respectively in the wastewater treatment process wwtp of tianjin china gan et al 2013 and our previous study detected the ace and suc in five wwtps of jiangsu china with the concentrations in the range of 2 7 12 49 μg l 1 li et al 2018 wwtp has been considered as one of the most important pollution sources of ass but ace and suc could not be effectively removed by conventional treatment processes torres et al 2011 such as biodegradation ngoc han et al 2015 precipitation and flocculation scheurer et al 2010 therefore more effective advanced treatment technologies for the degradation of ass are required our previous research showed that ultraviolet persulfate uv ps can remove the ass in wastewater efficiently fu et al 2019b uv ps involving strategies for generating hydroxyl radical ho and sulfate radical so4 due to high redox potential 1 8 2 7 v for ho 2 5 3 1 v for so4 ao and liu 2017 are effective and promising advanced oxidation processes aops in eliminating micropollutants huber et al 2003 tan et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b our pervious study explored the roles of diverse reactive species such as ho and so4 and the degradation in real wastewater fu et al 2019a the results showed that 1 ho so4 and uv contribute to the degradation of micropollutants 2 the water matrices such as natural organic matter nom and anions in real wastewater can react with ho and so4 thus the degradation of micropollutants in different types of wastewater is different on the basis of the effect of water matrices a radical based degradation kinetic model for predicting the ass degradation in real wastewater by uv ps has been established through response surface methodology rsm fu et al 2019b the removal of ace and suc was well predicted by the model and the effects of water matrices on the ass degradation could also be investigated through this model however the specific degradations kinetic of ass cannot be explained by this model and the kinetic degradation process of ass is not yet clear it is necessary to build a model to predict the removal process and explain the kinetic of ass in real wastewater by uv ps additionally the degradation pathways of ass during uv ps have not been fully explored ass are generally considered safe kroger et al 2006 but more and more studies paid attention to the environmental risks of ass owing to its widespread presence and the toxicity studies are mostly for its acute toxicity currently a study indicated that suc affects the behavior and physiology of daphnia magna and its acetyl cholinesterase ache activity has been changed and suc induced neurological and oxidative mechanisms simultaneously eriksson wiklund et al 2014 on the other hand some studies show that the toxicity after aops is different when trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole in synthetic human urine were degraded by uv ps and uv h2o2 the acute toxicity after treatment was higher zhang et al 2016a however the degradation of triclosan by thermally activated persulfate decreased ecotoxicity gao et al 2016 besides a study olmez hanci et al 2014 explored the toxicity of commonly known oxidants the result shows that the excess oxidants may cause the ecotoxicity therefore the toxicity evaluation of ass during uv ps degradation need to be considered this paper investigate the removal of two ass ace and suc using uv ps the objectives of this study are 1 to establish a kinetic prediction model to describe the degradation process of ass by uv ps and evaluate the applicability of the model in real wastewater 2 to compare the two models based on kinetic and water matrices parameters 3 to reveal the degradation pathway of ass by the uv ps process and 4 to explore the toxicity change of ass after uv ps treatment the obtained results could provide useful information on the applicability of aop process for the treatment of wastewater contaminated with ass or other micropollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials ace suc naproxen npx and tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris with purities higher than 99

using a millipore purification system milli q millipore all other solvents and reagents were of analytical grade three real wastewater samples wttp1 wttp2 and wttp3 were collected from domestic secondary effluents while other two real wastewater samples wttp4 and wttp5 were collected from coking secondary effluents the wastewater quality parameters such as cod toc and ph are summarized in table s1 the wastewater was filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose nitrate membrane and stored inside polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe bottles in a refrigerator 4 c to facilitate the measurement of micropollutant concentrations during water treatment all five wastewater samples were spiked with both ace suc npx and pcba to achieve an initial concentration of 1 μm for each micropollutant 2 2 experiment the photochemical experiments were performed using a photoreaction operation reactor xpa 7 nanjing xujiang motor factory china the structure and parameters of the photochemical reactor can be seen in our earlier study fu et al 2019b 1 μm ass were chosen as experimental concentration the ps was ten times the concentration of each micropollutant xu et al 2016 for degradation experiments a

time intervals 1 ml of sample was transferred to a chromatography for analysis 2 3 toxicity assessment the toxicity of ass treated by uv ps was evaluated using c carpio which was purchased from a

toxicological effect of transformation products tps and the time effect of uv ps treatment besides the recovery group was set to observe the reversibility of the toxic effects all groups were continuously aerated half of the volume of each exposure solution was renewed every day to control for ass concentration and maintain water quality at the end of the experiment the fish were dissected

experiments committee of the nanjing university 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics prediction model for ass degradation 3 1 1 degradation kinetics of ass by the uv ps process as reported in previous research fu et al 2019b ace and suc could be degraded effectively using uv ps process and the degradation of ace and suc by uv ps process followed the pseudo first order kinetics pattern and the overall rate law for ass degradation could be expressed as eq 1 tan et al 2017 1 ln c t c 0 k m t where k m represents the pseudo first order rate constants s 1 of micropollutant by uv ps process c t and c 0 are the concentrations m of micropollutant at time t s and time zero respectively ho and so4 coexist in the uv ps process contribute to the degradation of ass in the uv ps system moussavi et al 2017 ho can be generated when so4 react with water and oh eq 2 and 3 waldemer et al 2007 2 so4 h2o ho h so4 2 3 so4 oh ho so4 2 in our previous studies fu et al 2019b it s reported that uv photolysis ho so4 and ps contributes the degradation of ace in uv ps process while only ho so4 and ps contributes the degradation of suc additionally the contribution of ps is small and negligible based on the relative contributions of reactive species in uv ps as well as the assumption that uv photolysis ho and so4 play the dominant role a simplified kinetic model of micropollutant degradation by uv ps was established eq 4 4 k m k u v m k h o m h o s s k s o 4 m s o 4 s s k uv m is the pseudo first order rate constants s 1 for uv photolysis of micropollutant k h o m and k s o 4 m represent the second order rate constants m 1s 1 of the micropollutant reacting with ho and so4 respectively h o s s and s o 4 s s were the steady state concentrations m of ho and so4 respectively k uv m k h o m and k s o 4 m are considered to be changeless in these experiments and they can be obtained through experiments or literatures the values of k m h o s s and s o 4 s s are considered to be changed in different experiments based on the steady state assumption both h o s s and s o 4 s s were constants in given water and the values could be calculated through the degradations of two reference compounds it means the degradation process of target micropollutants could be simulated npx and pcba were chosen as reference compounds because its second order rate constants with ho so4 are similar with that of ace and suc fu et al 2019b lian et al 2017 the rate constants of ace suc npx and pcba are shown in table 1 substituting npx and pcba into eq 4 to obtain eqs 5 and 6 the values of k npx and k pcba were calculated through eq 1 and the values of h o s s and s o 4 s s in given water could be calculated through eqs 5 and 6 then the pseudo first order rate constants of several target micropollutants with known second order rate constants could be calculated through eq 4 that is its degradation process could be simulated without measure of target micropollutants in this study k a c e and k s u c could be simulated by substituting h o s s and s o 4 s s 5 h o k s o 4 p c b a k npx k p cba k s o 4 n p x k s o 4 p c b a k h o n p x k h o p c b a k s o 4 n p x 6 s o 4 k p cba k h o n p x k h o p c b a k npx k s o 4 p c b a k h o n p x k h o p c b a k s o 4 n p x in real wastewater water matrix components such as anions and natural organic matter affect the degradation through scavenging ho and so4 to form new radicals the concentrations of these new radicals were extremely low and the rate constants of micropollutants with these new radicals is usually lower than that with ho and so4 wang et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 so the direct reactions of water matrices with micropollutants is negligible and the effect of water matrices on micropollutants degradation is mainly due to their quenching to ho and so4 3 1 2 prediction model for ass degradation in real wastewater to get the pseudo first order rate constants of npx k npx and pcba k pcba in real wastewater a series of experiments by uv ps were carried out fig 1 shows the time dependent degradation of reference substrates npx and pcba in a milli q water b wwtp1 c wwtp2 d wwtp3 e wwtp4 and f wwtp5 by uv ps as shown in fig 1 k npx and k pcba in milli q water and real wastewater fit with the pseudo first order kinetics pattern and could be calculated through eq 1 and the specific values are shown in table 2 then the values of h o s s and s o 4 s s were obtained through eqs 5 and 6 respectively based on the values of h o s s and s o 4 s s and the reactive species reaction rate constants table 1 k a c e and k s u c in milli q water and five real wastewater were calculated through eq 4 the results are summarized in table 2 as shown in fig 1 the removal of npx and pcba in real wastewater is clearly lower than that in milli q water and the calculated steady state concentrations of ho and so4 in milli q water were obviously higher than that in wastewater table 2 the substances in wastewater led to the reduction of ho and so4 thus inhibited the degradation of micropollutants besides the calculated steady state concentrations of ho in milli q water and real wastewater was relatively stable while the calculated steady state concentrations of so4 in milli q water and real wastewater varied greatly that is in agreement with the results simulated using kintecus software in previous study fu et al 2019b additionally the values of k a c e and k s u c of wttp4 and wwtp5 were a little small than that of other three samples and the calculated steady state concentrations of so4 in wttp4 and wwtp5 were far lower than that in other three samples the difference was due to the water quality the coking wastewater is a complex mixture of pollutants comprising thousands of organic pollutants the values of toc in wwtp4 and wwtp5 were higher than that in other water samples shown in table s1 and the content of nom in coking wastewater is higher than that in domestic wastewater lai et al 2007 nom can act as a radical scavenger and an inner filter of uv light which leads to an inhibitory effect on the degradation of ass and previous study showed that nom played an important inhibition role in ass degradation by uv ps system fu et al 2019b k a c e and k s u c in table 2 were the calculated pseudo first order rate constants of ace and suc respectively the predicted time dependent degradations of ass were simulated through eq 1 and the experimental and predicted degradations of ace and suc in milli q water and five wastewaters were showed in fig 2 the model results in fig 2 agreed well with the experimental degradation of ace and suc this result suggested that the combined use of the of reactive species reaction rate constants of ass k uv m k h o m and k s o 4 m and steady state concentrations of reactive species h o s s and s o 4 s s may be effective for predicting the degradation process of ass by uv ps this is consistent with the finding of previous studies on the degradation of penicillin antibiotics and it s reported that the similar model successfully predicted the degradation of penicillin antibiotics in ultrapure water zhou et al 2018 the discrepancy between predicted values and experimental values can be explained by the presence of other radicals such as co3 cl cloh no3 and no2 in real wastewater besides a study suggested that the similar model involving co3 ho and so4 as reactive species was accurate for predicting the removal of the 9 pharmaceuticals lian et al 2017 the different model parameters are due to the different activity of target pollutants with co3 the second order rate constant of co3 with ace and suc is much smaller than that with the 9 pharmaceuticals fu et al 2019b lian et al 2017 of note the model predicted the degradations of only ace and suc in this paper it can also be used to predict the degradation of a variety of micropollutants with known second order rate constants k simultaneously it means the degradation process of a variety of micropollutants could be simulated just through measuring the steady state concentrations of reactive species in different water 3 1 3 comparison of prediction models for ass degradation the prediction model for ass degradation by uv ps above was established based on the kinetics of reactive species also our previous study established a water matrices parameters model for predicting ass degradation by uv ps in real wastewater it was based on water matrices parameters and investigated through response surface methodology rsm fu et al 2019b in the prediction model based on water matrices the removal of ace y 1 and suc y 2 after 1800 s were predicted based on 4 factors bicarbonate x 1 chlorine x 2 nitrate x 3 and nom x 4 in terms of coded values through eqs 7 and 8 7 y 1 85 95 5 22x 1 9 595x 2 2 74x 3 8 73x 4 1 85x 1 x 2 1 67x 1 x 3 0 57x 1 x 4 4 78x 2 x 3 0 75x 2 x 4 3 27x 3 x 4 0 36x 1 2 2 35x 2 2 11 85x 3 2 3 49x 4 2 8 y 2 54 93 8 09x 1 6 08x 2 5 89x 3 6 27x 4 0 65x 1 x 2 0 043x 1 x 3 1 35x 1 x 4 2 76x 2 x 3 0 88x 2 x 4 1 32x 3 x 4 1 06x 1 2 0 48x 2 2 0 67x 3 2 0 66x 4 2 it has been confirmed that the removal of ace and suc in three real wastewaters could be well predicted by the model fu et al 2019b comparing the two models the two prediction models shows some differences in several aspects 1 aim the kinetic model focused on the kinetic of reactive species it could predict the specific degradation process and the different removal could be explained through the calculated steady state concentrations of ho and so4 the water matrices prediction model focused on the water matrices the effects of water matrices on the degradation could be analyzed through the model equations and the differences of removal in real wastewater could be explained by water quality 2 application the kinetic model was established based on the kinetics of reactive species and the effect of water matrices on micropollutants degradation was thought as the scavenger to ho and so4 so the kinetic model has a wide applicability for different waters such as groundwater and surface water wang et al 2018 the water matrices model was established based on the effect of water matrices on micropollutants degradation for keeping the legitimacy of the model equations the experiment was carried out in wastewater with similar water parameters so the model was more suitable for wastewater with similar water parameters 3 experiment to predict the degradation of target micropollutants through h o s s and s o 4 s s the concentrations of two reference compounds during the degradation process is the only data needs to be measured besides the water matrices model could predict the removal of target micropollutants through main water matrices and the concentrations of the water matrices in wastewater needs to be measured 4 target micropollutants the kinetic prediction model is suitable for predicting the degradation process of a variety of micropollutants whose second order rate constants with ho and so4 are known and for keeping the legitimacy of the water matrices model the major influencing factors should be known and the major influencing factors of target micropollutants should be same so it limits the amount of target micropollutants 3 2 proposed degradation pathway of ass by the uv persulfate process uv ps caused the degradation of ass and producing a range of tps it s necessary to identify the tps for surmising the proposed degradation pathway and full evaluating the environmental risk in our pervious study three major products of ace in the uv ps system were detected while four major products of suc were detected the detailed information of the tps is listed in tables s2 and s3 based on the tps identification information and the pervious explorations the degradation pathway of ace fig 3 and suc fig 4 by uv ps process were then proposed as described above uv photolysis ho and so4 caused the degradations of ass in uv ps process and ho and so4 may react with micropollutants through hydrogen extraction addition reaction and electron transfer neta et al 1977 as shown in fig 3 for ace the formation of tp 1 and tp 2 involved two intermediates a and b gan et al 2014 the intermediate a is an isomer of tp 3 they were the direct oxidation products of ace the c c in ring structure was attacked by the radicals and then a and tp 3 were formed by the addition of water the intermediate a was unstable the ring structure was dehydrated to form aldehydes and amino substitution occurred on the chain alkyl groups to form tp 1 meanwhile the intermediate a also underwent intramolecular rearrangement the n containing moieties of a was easily attacked by ho and so4 and then the ring opening reactions occurred to generate intermediate b it s reported that tp 1 of ace cloud be produced with radicals during the uv photolysis li et al 2016 tp 2 and tp 3 of ace were identified through natural sunlight gan et al 2014 tp 2 was the product after decarboxylation of b according to the report sang et al 2014 ace would be hydrolyzed under uv irradiation in acidic condition however the tps of ace in this paper retain the ring structure and the other hydrolytic product acetamide was not detected the differences may arise from differences in experimental conditions and ace was more susceptible to hydrolyze under acidic conditions in addition the toxicity in embryo development induced by tp 1 increased evidently relative to the parent compound li et al 2016 this indicates that it is indispensable to conduct the toxicity assessment of tps suc is a highly hydroxylated molecule whose potential reaction sites include ch2 oh c cl ch2 cl on five atoms ring and oh on the ring structure and the degradation of suc may involve cleavage of glycosidic bonds substitution of cl and h oxidation of oh on the methyl group and elimination of hcl etc hu et al 2017 as seen in fig 4 tp 1 is a fructose structure formed by the cleavage of glycosidic bond accompanied by the formation of tp 4 the existence of a single cl atom in tp 3 indicates that tp 3 is derivative formed by the loss of a hydroxymethyl in tp 4 it is suggested that ho and so4 would attack the hydroxymethyl on the six membered ring of tp 4 and form a carbon centered radical the carbon centered radical is unstable and occurs a ring opening reaction to form tp 3 keen and linden 2013 in the suc molecule oh on the methyl group is more active than the oh on the ring structure thus it is easy to be attacked by ho and so4 to form aldehyde group on the contrary the cl on the six membered ring of suc is more active than the cl on the methyl group because of the poor ability of cl on the six membered ring to withdraw electrons from a ring structure and cl on the methyl group has steric hindrance which leads the poor ability to be attacked by ho and so4 keen and linden 2013 so the cl on the six membered ring is attacked with the elimination of hcl and formed c c that is tp 2 the tp 1 and tp 3 of suc were also observed by xu et al 2017 during uv ps process while hu et al 2017 elucidated tp 2 during ozone consequently on the basis of the results obtained in this study in the degradation of ace by uv ps process the addition reaction on the ring structure was supposed to be the main reaction step while the degradation of suc was mainly due to the cleavage of glycosidic bond oxidation of oh on the methyl group and elimination of hcl 3 3 toxicity evaluation of ass after uv ps treatment on c carpio fig 5 displays the a sod activity b mda levels and c ache activity of c carpio exposed to ass before and after uv ps treatment as shown sod activity of groups c f clearly decreased compared the control group group a p 0 05 and the sod activity of group with ps group c were the lowest with 36 sod activity inhibition compared to group a besides the ache activity of groups c d were lower than that of the control group significantly p 0 05 and the ache activity of group with ass treated for 300 s group d was the lowest among these groups on the contrary the mda levels of all groups increased significantly compared to the control group p 0 05 and the mda level of group d was the highest additionally the sod activity mda levels and ache activity of recovery group group f was similar to that of the control group these means that higher toxicity on c carpio liver of ass after uv ps treatment and the toxicity of ass treated for 300 s is higher than that of ass treated for 1800 s comparing with the control group the inhibition of sod and ache activity and the increase of mda levels in all groups means that ass had adverse effect on livers of c carpio many xenobiotics can produce reactive oxygen species ros via several mechanisms and there is an equilibrium between antioxidant defenses and the generation of ros ahmad et al 2000 however if the xenobiotics destroy the balance oxidative stress will be formed which may lead to irreversible damage of dna and other macromolecules and even to death modesto and martinez 2010 sod as index for antioxidant status is most responsive indicator of exposure to contaminants eliciting oxidative stress and excessive ros can lead to a decrease in sod activity the inhibition of sod activity indicated that ps and treated solution group d and e induced the oxidative stress in livers of c carpio the lowest sod activity of group with ps may show that ps has the great influence on sod activity this is consistent with the findings of previous study on the toxicity of common oxidants and it revealed that ps exhibited high acute toxicity to d magna olmez hanci et al 2014 the sod activity of ass after uv ps treatment showed higher inhibition than ass it suggested that the toxicity of treated solution on oxidative stress was higher than that of ass ren et al 2016 explored the toxicity of ace before and after uv treatment on fish liver and the result that sod activity of ace after uv treatment showed higher inhibition than ace is consistent with findings in this paper mda as the production of the reaction between ros and unsaturated fatty acids in cellular membrane papadimitriou and loumbourdis 2002 the increase of mda indicates lipid peroxidation has occurred in the fish ma et al 2014 the obvious increase of mda levels in groups with ass ps and treated solution may be due to the impairment of the antioxidant system and ass ps and treated solution caused lipid peroxidation in livers of c carpio the higher mda levels of ass treated for 300 s and 1800 s than ass implied the higher oxidation damage of ass after uv ps treatment similar finding is supported by the toxicity test of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs and their treated solution gao et al 2018 as for ache as an important enzyme it catalyzed the hydrolysis of the acetylcholine neurotransmitter when the severity of poisoning is increased the ache activity decreased correspondingly kavitha and rao 2008 there is no significant difference in ache activity between the control group with group b and group f while the reduction of ache activity observed in groups c e it indicated that the addition of ps and ass after uv ps treatment led to the cholinergic toxicity and the lowest ache activity of ass treated for 300 s revealed the highest cholinergic toxicity according to the results of sod mda and ache above it can be found that the toxicity of ass after uv ps treatment is higher than that of ass besides comparing the biochemical assays of group with ass treated for 300 s and group with ass treated for 1800 s ass treated for 300 s showed more obvious inhibitions of sod activity and ache activity and the mda levels of ass treated for 300 s was the higher the toxicity of ass treated for 1800 s is higher than ass p 0 05 it may be due to the toxic intermediate products produced during the uv ps process besides ps showed its toxicity to c carpio so ps and tps should be the major cause of the toxicity of treated solution thus during the degradation by aops the ecological risk caused by excess oxidant should be noticed in addition how to distinguish the toxicity of tps and the toxicity caused by excess ps is worth exploring moreover after the recovery for 7 days in fresh water group f all indicators of fish livers showed different degree of return it implied the toxic effect of ass and its treated solution on livers of c carpio is reversible drost et al 2007 therefore in the practical of the uv ps process it is suggested that a comprehensive evaluation of both removal in real wastewater and environmental risk should be considered and it can be properly extending the treatment time controlling the dosage of ps and exploring the combined process to reduce the toxicity 4 conclusions both ace and suc in water can be removed effectively by uv ps process the degradation of ace and suc both followed the pseudo first order kinetics and the uv photolysis ho and so4 play the dominant roles in the degradation of ass by uv ps a kinetic model was established based on the steady state concentrations of ho and so4 and the model can predict the degradation of ass by uv ps in real wastewater well compared the model based on water matrices parameter the radical based degradation kinetic model is suitable for more micropollutants and more types of real waste water additionally the tentative pathways of ass degradations by uv ps are proposed the toxicity of ass after uv ps treatment on c carpio liver was higher than that of ass and prolongation of treatment time and recovery in fresh water can reduce the toxicity on c carpio the conclusions derived from the present study would provide not only to theoretical basis for the estimation of micropollutants degradation in real wastewater but also to the toxicity risk assessment of uv ps process declaration of

18439,artificial sweeteners ass have been frequently detected in aquatic environment and are of emerging concern due to their environmental persistence acesulfame ace and sucralose suc are two ass that are difficult to remove the ultraviolet persulfate uv ps advanced oxidation process has been proven to remove ass in real wastewater effectively in this study radical based degradation kinetic model pathways and toxicity evaluation of ass by uv ps process were explored ace and suc were effectively removed by uv ps process and uv photolysis hydroxyl radicals ho and sulfate radicals so4 contributes the degradation of ass a kinetic prediction model for ass degradation was established based on the second order rate constants with ho and so4 and the steady state concentrations of ho and so4 were calculated through the degradations of two reference compounds the kinetic model could predict the degradation process of ass in five real wastewaters effluents furthermore two models based on the kinetic and the water matrices parameters for ass degradation in wastewater were compared finally the tentative pathways of ass degradations by uv ps were proposed also toxicity evaluation showed that ass after uv ps treatment enhanced the toxicity on c carpio liver and prolongation of treatment time and recovery in fresh water can reduce the toxicity on c carpio graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv persulfate artificial sweeteners kinetic predicting model degradation pathway toxicity 1 introduction artificial sweeteners ass are popular sugar substitutes used in food beverages confectionary pharmaceuticals and personal care products lin et al 2017 the occurrence fate and removal of ass in aquatic environment have drawn great attention during the last decade scheurer et al 2009 among the ass which have been regarded as contaminants of emerging concern acesulfame ace and sucralose suc are frequently detected in seawater mead et al 2009 surface water scheurer et al 2011 groundwater van stempvoort et al 2013 and wastewater li et al 2018 the concentrations of ace and suc can even reach 1 0 and 15 μg l 1 respectively in the wastewater treatment process wwtp of tianjin china gan et al 2013 and our previous study detected the ace and suc in five wwtps of jiangsu china with the concentrations in the range of 2 7 12 49 μg l 1 li et al 2018 wwtp has been considered as one of the most important pollution sources of ass but ace and suc could not be effectively removed by conventional treatment processes torres et al 2011 such as biodegradation ngoc han et al 2015 precipitation and flocculation scheurer et al 2010 therefore more effective advanced treatment technologies for the degradation of ass are required our previous research showed that ultraviolet persulfate uv ps can remove the ass in wastewater efficiently fu et al 2019b uv ps involving strategies for generating hydroxyl radical ho and sulfate radical so4 due to high redox potential 1 8 2 7 v for ho 2 5 3 1 v for so4 ao and liu 2017 are effective and promising advanced oxidation processes aops in eliminating micropollutants huber et al 2003 tan et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b our pervious study explored the roles of diverse reactive species such as ho and so4 and the degradation in real wastewater fu et al 2019a the results showed that 1 ho so4 and uv contribute to the degradation of micropollutants 2 the water matrices such as natural organic matter nom and anions in real wastewater can react with ho and so4 thus the degradation of micropollutants in different types of wastewater is different on the basis of the effect of water matrices a radical based degradation kinetic model for predicting the ass degradation in real wastewater by uv ps has been established through response surface methodology rsm fu et al 2019b the removal of ace and suc was well predicted by the model and the effects of water matrices on the ass degradation could also be investigated through this model however the specific degradations kinetic of ass cannot be explained by this model and the kinetic degradation process of ass is not yet clear it is necessary to build a model to predict the removal process and explain the kinetic of ass in real wastewater by uv ps additionally the degradation pathways of ass during uv ps have not been fully explored ass are generally considered safe kroger et al 2006 but more and more studies paid attention to the environmental risks of ass owing to its widespread presence and the toxicity studies are mostly for its acute toxicity currently a study indicated that suc affects the behavior and physiology of daphnia magna and its acetyl cholinesterase ache activity has been changed and suc induced neurological and oxidative mechanisms simultaneously eriksson wiklund et al 2014 on the other hand some studies show that the toxicity after aops is different when trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole in synthetic human urine were degraded by uv ps and uv h2o2 the acute toxicity after treatment was higher zhang et al 2016a however the degradation of triclosan by thermally activated persulfate decreased ecotoxicity gao et al 2016 besides a study olmez hanci et al 2014 explored the toxicity of commonly known oxidants the result shows that the excess oxidants may cause the ecotoxicity therefore the toxicity evaluation of ass during uv ps degradation need to be considered this paper investigate the removal of two ass ace and suc using uv ps the objectives of this study are 1 to establish a kinetic prediction model to describe the degradation process of ass by uv ps and evaluate the applicability of the model in real wastewater 2 to compare the two models based on kinetic and water matrices parameters 3 to reveal the degradation pathway of ass by the

experiments committee of the nanjing university 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics prediction model for ass degradation 3 1 1 degradation kinetics of ass by the uv ps process as reported in previous research fu et al 2019b ace and suc could be degraded effectively using uv ps process and the degradation of ace and suc by uv ps process followed the pseudo first order kinetics pattern and the overall rate law for ass degradation could be expressed as eq 1 tan et al 2017 1 ln c t c 0 k m t where k m represents the pseudo first order rate constants s 1 of micropollutant by uv ps process c t and c 0 are the concentrations m of micropollutant at time t s and time zero respectively ho and so4 coexist in the uv ps process contribute to the degradation of ass in the uv ps system moussavi et al 2017 ho can be generated when so4 react with water and oh eq 2 and 3 waldemer et al 2007 2 so4 h2o ho h so4 2 3 so4 oh ho so4 2 in our previous studies fu et al 2019b it s reported that uv photolysis ho so4 and ps contributes the degradation of ace in uv ps process while only ho so4 and ps contributes the degradation of suc additionally the contribution of ps is small and negligible based on the relative contributions of reactive species in uv ps as well as the assumption that uv photolysis ho and so4 play the dominant role a simplified kinetic model of micropollutant degradation by uv ps was established eq 4 4 k m k u v m k h o m h o s s k s o 4 m s o 4 s s k uv m is the pseudo first order rate constants s 1 for uv photolysis of micropollutant k h o m and k s o 4 m represent the second order rate constants m 1s 1 of the micropollutant reacting with ho and so4 respectively h o s s and s o 4 s s were the steady state concentrations m of ho and so4 respectively k uv m k h o m and k s o 4 m are considered to be changeless in these experiments and they can be obtained through experiments or literatures the values of k m h o s s and s o 4 s s are considered to be changed in different experiments based on the steady state assumption both h o s s and s o 4 s s were constants in given water and the values could be calculated through the degradations of two reference compounds it means the degradation process of target micropollutants could be simulated npx and pcba were chosen as reference compounds because its second order rate constants with ho so4 are similar with that of ace and suc fu et al 2019b lian et al 2017 the rate constants of ace suc npx and pcba are shown in table 1 substituting npx and pcba into eq 4 to obtain eqs 5 and 6 the values of k npx and k pcba were calculated through eq 1 and the values of h o s s and s o 4 s s in given water could be calculated through eqs 5 and 6 then the pseudo first order rate constants of several target micropollutants with known second order rate constants could be calculated through eq 4 that is its degradation process could be simulated without measure of target micropollutants in this study k a c e and k s u c could be simulated by substituting h o s s and s o 4 s s 5 h o k s o 4 p c b a k npx k p cba k s o 4 n p x k s o 4 p c b a k h o n p x k h o p c b a k s o 4 n p x 6 s o 4 k p cba k h o n p x k h o p c b a k npx k s o 4 p c b a k h o n p x k h o p c b a k s o 4 n p x in real wastewater water matrix components such as anions and natural organic matter affect the degradation through scavenging ho and so4 to form new radicals the concentrations of these new radicals were extremely low and the rate constants of micropollutants with these new radicals is usually lower than that with ho and so4 wang et al 2016 xiao et al 2016 so the direct reactions of water matrices with micropollutants is negligible and the effect of water matrices on micropollutants degradation is mainly due to their quenching to ho and so4 3 1 2 prediction model for ass degradation in real wastewater to get the pseudo first order rate constants of npx k npx and pcba k pcba in real wastewater a series of experiments by uv ps were carried out fig 1 shows the time dependent degradation of reference substrates npx and pcba in a milli q water b wwtp1 c wwtp2 d wwtp3 e wwtp4 and f wwtp5 by uv ps as shown in fig 1 k npx and k pcba in milli q water and real wastewater fit with the pseudo first order kinetics pattern and could be calculated through eq 1 and the specific values are shown in table 2 then the values of h o s s and s o 4 s s were obtained through eqs 5 and 6 respectively based on the values of h o s s and s o 4 s s and the reactive species reaction rate constants table 1 k a c e and k s u c in milli q water and five real wastewater were calculated through eq 4 the results are summarized in table 2 as shown in fig 1 the removal of npx and pcba in real wastewater is clearly lower than that in milli q water and the calculated steady state concentrations of ho and so4 in milli q water were obviously higher than that in wastewater table 2 the substances in wastewater led to the reduction of ho and so4 thus inhibited the degradation of micropollutants besides the calculated steady state concentrations of ho in milli q water and real wastewater was relatively stable while the calculated steady state concentrations of so4 in milli q water and real wastewater varied greatly that is in agreement with the results simulated using kintecus software in previous study fu et al 2019b additionally the values of k a c e and k s u c of wttp4 and wwtp5 were a little small than that of other three samples and the calculated steady state concentrations of so4 in wttp4 and wwtp5 were far lower than that in other three samples the difference was due to the water quality the coking wastewater is a complex mixture of pollutants comprising thousands of organic pollutants the values of toc in wwtp4 and wwtp5 were higher than that in other water samples shown in table s1 and the content of nom in coking wastewater is higher than that in domestic wastewater lai et al 2007 nom can act as a radical scavenger and an inner filter of uv light which leads to an inhibitory effect on the degradation of ass and previous study showed that nom played an important inhibition role in ass degradation by uv ps system fu et al 2019b k a c e and k s u c in table 2 were the calculated pseudo first order rate constants of ace and suc respectively the predicted time dependent degradations of ass were simulated through eq 1 and the experimental and predicted degradations of ace and suc in milli q water and five wastewaters were showed in fig 2 the model results in fig 2 agreed well with the experimental degradation of ace and suc this result suggested that the combined use of the of reactive species reaction rate constants of ass k uv m k h o m and k s o 4 m and steady state concentrations of reactive species h o s s and s o 4 s s may be effective for predicting the degradation process of ass by uv ps this is consistent with the finding of previous studies on the degradation of penicillin antibiotics and it s reported that the similar model successfully predicted the degradation of penicillin antibiotics in ultrapure water zhou et al 2018 the discrepancy between predicted values and experimental values can be explained by the presence of other radicals such as co3 cl cloh no3 and no2 in real wastewater besides a study suggested that the similar model involving co3 ho and so4 as reactive species was accurate for predicting the removal of the 9 pharmaceuticals lian et al 2017 the different model parameters are due to the different activity of target pollutants with co3 the second order rate constant of co3 with ace and suc is much smaller than that with the 9 pharmaceuticals fu et al 2019b lian et al 2017 of note the model predicted the degradations of only ace and suc in this paper it can also be used to predict the degradation of a variety of micropollutants with known second order rate constants k simultaneously it means the degradation process of a variety of micropollutants could be simulated just through measuring the steady state concentrations of reactive species in different water 3 1 3 comparison of prediction models for ass degradation the prediction model for ass degradation by uv ps above was established based on the kinetics of reactive species also our previous study established a water matrices parameters model for predicting ass degradation by uv ps in real wastewater it was based on water matrices parameters and investigated through response surface methodology rsm fu et al 2019b in the prediction model based on water matrices the removal of ace y 1 and suc y 2 after 1800 s were predicted based on 4 factors bicarbonate x 1 chlorine x 2 nitrate x 3 and nom x 4 in terms of coded values through eqs 7 and 8 7 y 1 85 95 5 22x 1 9 595x 2 2 74x 3 8 73x 4 1 85x 1 x 2 1 67x 1 x 3 0 57x 1 x 4 4 78x 2 x 3 0 75x 2 x 4 3 27x 3 x 4 0 36x 1 2 2 35x 2 2 11 85x 3 2 3 49x 4 2 8 y 2 54 93 8 09x 1 6 08x 2 5 89x 3 6 27x 4 0 65x 1 x 2 0 043x 1 x 3 1 35x 1 x 4 2 76x 2 x 3 0 88x 2 x 4 1 32x 3 x 4 1 06x 1 2 0 48x 2 2 0 67x 3 2 0 66x 4 2 it has been confirmed that the removal of ace and suc in three real wastewaters could be well predicted by the model fu et al 2019b comparing the two models the two prediction models shows some differences in several aspects 1 aim the kinetic model focused on the kinetic of reactive species it could predict the specific degradation process and the different removal could be explained through the calculated steady state concentrations of ho and so4 the water matrices prediction model focused on the water matrices the effects of water matrices on the degradation could be analyzed through the model equations and the differences of removal in real wastewater could be explained by water quality 2 application the kinetic model was established based on the kinetics of reactive species and the effect of water matrices on micropollutants degradation was thought as the scavenger to ho and so4 so the kinetic model has a wide applicability for different waters such as groundwater and surface water wang et al 2018 the water matrices model was established based on the effect of water matrices on micropollutants degradation for keeping the legitimacy of the model equations the experiment was carried out in wastewater with similar water parameters so the model was more suitable for wastewater with similar water parameters 3 experiment to predict the degradation of target micropollutants through h o s s and s o 4 s s the concentrations of two reference compounds during the degradation process is the only data needs to be measured besides the water matrices model could predict the removal of target micropollutants through main water matrices and the concentrations of the water matrices in wastewater needs to be measured 4 target micropollutants the kinetic prediction model is suitable for predicting the degradation process of a variety of micropollutants whose second order rate constants with ho and so4 are known and for keeping the legitimacy of the water matrices model the major influencing factors should be known and the major influencing factors of target micropollutants should be same so it limits the amount of target micropollutants 3 2 proposed degradation pathway of ass by the uv persulfate process uv ps caused the degradation of ass and producing a range of tps it s necessary to identify the tps for surmising the proposed degradation pathway and full evaluating the environmental risk in our pervious study three major products of ace in the uv ps system were detected while four major products of suc were detected the detailed information of the tps is listed in tables s2 and s3 based on the tps identification information and the pervious explorations the degradation pathway of ace fig 3 and suc fig 4 by uv ps process were then proposed as described above uv photolysis ho and so4 caused the degradations of ass in uv ps process and ho and so4 may react with micropollutants through hydrogen extraction addition reaction and electron transfer neta et al 1977 as shown in fig 3 for ace the formation of tp 1 and tp 2 involved two intermediates a and b gan et al 2014 the intermediate a is an isomer of tp 3 they were the direct oxidation products of ace the c c in ring structure was attacked by the radicals and then a and tp 3 were formed by the addition of water the intermediate a was unstable the ring structure was dehydrated to form aldehydes and amino substitution occurred on the chain alkyl groups to form tp 1 meanwhile the intermediate a also underwent intramolecular rearrangement the n containing moieties of a was easily attacked by ho and so4 and then the ring opening reactions occurred to generate intermediate b it s reported that tp 1 of ace cloud be produced with radicals during the uv photolysis li et al 2016 tp 2 and tp 3 of ace were identified through natural sunlight gan et al 2014 tp 2 was the product after decarboxylation of b according to the report sang et al 2014 ace would be hydrolyzed under uv irradiation in acidic condition however the tps of ace in this paper retain the ring structure and the other hydrolytic product acetamide was not detected the differences may arise from differences in experimental conditions and ace was more susceptible to hydrolyze under acidic conditions in addition the toxicity in embryo development induced by tp 1 increased evidently relative to the parent compound li et al 2016 this indicates that it is indispensable to conduct the toxicity assessment of tps suc is a highly hydroxylated molecule whose potential reaction sites include ch2 oh c cl ch2 cl on five atoms ring and oh on the ring structure and the degradation of suc may involve cleavage of glycosidic bonds substitution of cl and h oxidation of oh on the methyl group and elimination of hcl etc hu et al 2017 as seen in fig 4 tp 1 is a fructose structure formed by the cleavage of glycosidic bond accompanied by the formation of tp 4 the existence of a single cl atom in tp 3 indicates that tp 3 is derivative formed by the loss of a hydroxymethyl in tp 4 it is suggested that ho and so4 would attack the hydroxymethyl on the six membered ring of tp 4 and form a carbon centered radical the carbon centered radical is unstable and occurs a ring opening reaction to form tp 3 keen and linden 2013 in the suc molecule oh on the methyl group is more active than the oh on the ring structure thus it is easy to be attacked by ho and so4 to form aldehyde group on the contrary the cl on the six membered ring of suc is more active than the cl on the methyl group because of the poor ability of cl on the six membered ring to withdraw electrons from a ring structure and cl on the methyl group has steric hindrance which leads the poor ability to be attacked by ho and so4 keen and linden 2013 so the cl on the six membered ring is attacked with the elimination of hcl and formed c c that is tp 2 the tp 1 and tp 3 of suc were also observed by xu et al 2017 during uv ps process while hu et al 2017 elucidated tp 2 during ozone consequently on the basis of the results obtained in this study in the degradation of ace by uv ps process the addition reaction on the ring structure was supposed to be the main reaction step while the degradation of suc was mainly due to the cleavage of glycosidic bond oxidation of oh on the methyl group and elimination of hcl 3 3 toxicity evaluation of ass after uv ps treatment on c carpio fig 5 displays the a sod activity b mda levels and c ache activity of c carpio exposed to ass before and after uv ps treatment as shown sod activity of groups c f clearly decreased compared the control group group a p 0 05 and the sod activity of group with ps group c were the lowest with 36 sod activity inhibition compared to group a besides the ache activity of groups c d were lower than that of the control group significantly p 0 05 and the ache activity of group with ass treated for 300 s group d was the lowest among these groups on the contrary the mda levels of all groups increased significantly compared to the control group p 0 05 and the mda level of group d was the highest additionally the sod activity mda levels and ache activity of recovery group group f was similar to that of the control group these means that higher toxicity on c carpio liver of ass after uv ps treatment and the toxicity of ass treated for 300 s is higher than that of ass treated for 1800 s comparing with the control group the inhibition of sod and ache activity and the increase of mda levels in all groups means that ass had adverse effect on livers of c carpio many xenobiotics can produce reactive oxygen species ros via several mechanisms and there is an equilibrium between antioxidant defenses and the generation of ros ahmad et al 2000 however if the xenobiotics destroy the balance oxidative stress will be formed which may lead to irreversible damage of dna and other macromolecules and even to death modesto and martinez 2010 sod as index for antioxidant status is most responsive indicator of exposure to contaminants eliciting oxidative stress and excessive ros can lead to a decrease in sod activity the inhibition of sod activity indicated that ps and treated solution group d and e induced the oxidative stress in livers of c carpio the lowest sod activity of group with ps may show that ps has the great influence on sod activity this is consistent with the findings of previous study on the toxicity of common oxidants and it revealed that ps exhibited high acute toxicity to d magna olmez hanci et al 2014 the sod activity of ass after uv ps treatment showed higher inhibition than ass it suggested that the toxicity of treated solution on oxidative stress was higher than that of ass ren et al 2016 explored the toxicity of ace before and after uv treatment on fish liver and the result that sod activity of ace after uv treatment showed higher inhibition than ace is consistent with findings in this paper mda as the production of the reaction between ros and unsaturated fatty acids in cellular membrane papadimitriou and loumbourdis 2002 the increase of mda indicates lipid peroxidation has occurred in the fish ma et al 2014 the obvious increase of mda levels in groups with ass ps and treated solution may be due to the impairment of the antioxidant system and ass ps and treated solution caused lipid peroxidation in livers of c carpio the higher mda levels of ass treated for 300 s and 1800 s than ass implied the higher oxidation damage of ass after uv ps treatment similar finding is supported by the toxicity test of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs and their treated solution gao et al 2018 as for ache as an important enzyme it catalyzed the hydrolysis of the acetylcholine neurotransmitter when the severity of poisoning is increased the ache activity decreased correspondingly kavitha and rao 2008 there is no significant difference in ache activity between the control group with group b and group f while the reduction of ache activity observed in groups c e it indicated that the addition of ps and ass after uv ps treatment led to the cholinergic toxicity and the lowest ache activity of ass treated for 300 s revealed the highest cholinergic toxicity according to the results of sod mda and ache above it can be found that the toxicity of ass after uv ps treatment is higher than that of ass besides comparing the biochemical assays of group with ass treated for 300 s and group with ass treated for 1800 s ass treated for 300 s showed more obvious inhibitions of sod activity and ache activity and the mda levels of ass treated for 300 s was the higher the toxicity of ass treated for 1800 s is higher than ass p 0 05 it may be due to the toxic intermediate products produced during the uv ps process besides ps showed its toxicity to c carpio so ps and tps should be the major cause of the toxicity of treated solution thus during the degradation by aops the ecological risk caused by excess oxidant should be noticed in addition how to distinguish the toxicity of tps and the toxicity caused by excess ps is worth exploring moreover after the recovery for 7 days in fresh water group f all indicators of fish livers showed different degree of return it implied the toxic effect of ass and its treated solution on livers of c carpio is reversible drost et al 2007 therefore in the practical of the uv ps process it is suggested that a comprehensive evaluation of both removal in real wastewater and environmental risk should be considered and it can be properly extending the treatment time controlling the dosage of ps and exploring the combined process to reduce the toxicity 4 conclusions both ace and suc in water can be removed effectively by uv ps process the degradation of ace and suc both followed the pseudo first order kinetics and the uv photolysis ho and so4 play the dominant roles in the degradation of ass by uv ps a kinetic model was established based on the steady state concentrations of ho and so4 and the model can predict the degradation of ass by uv ps in real wastewater well compared the model based on water matrices parameter the radical based degradation kinetic model is suitable for more micropollutants and more types of real waste water additionally the tentative pathways of ass degradations by uv ps are proposed the toxicity of ass after uv ps treatment on c carpio liver was higher than that of ass and prolongation of treatment time and recovery in fresh water can reduce the toxicity on c carpio the conclusions derived from the present study would provide not only to theoretical basis for the estimation of micropollutants degradation in real wastewater but also to the toxicity risk assessment of uv ps process declaration of
