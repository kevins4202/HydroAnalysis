23985,we investigated the performance of a tidally and subtidally forced open boundary condition tst obc on the estuarine shelf circulation in a limited area down scaling numerical modeling system for the northern south china sea we forced the modeling system with amplified tidal forces and subtidal forcing of spatiotemporally variable wind and river discharge tst obc numerically and physically accommodates the circulation driven by the regional tides subtidal forces external forcing from its upscale solution and internally generated disturbances the advantages of tst obc are the separation of fast tidal and slow subtidal modes active and dual wave transmitting schemes consistent treatment of barotropic and baroclinic circulation and thermodynamic variables which enable the model to capture observed circulation characteristics the results differ from the results obtained using the flather type obc which over restores internal to external solutions with a notable accumulation of spurious disturbances along the open boundaries disturbances with both tidal and subtidal signals that arrive at the open boundaries are well treated by adopting tst obc although it is currently feasible for the one way downscaling applications 1 introduction in numerical simulations of ocean circulation in a size limited area the open boundary condition obc crucially impacts the interior solutions however implementing the obc is an ill posed problem oliger and sundström 1978 the reduced physics and simplified mathematics have led to improperly imposed external forces and reflective evacuation of internal disturbances at the open boundaries a wrongly adapted obc prevents a sensible connection between the internal and external forces and distorts the interior solution this distorted solution is greater in shelf simulations where strong tidal and subtidal forces drive the hydrodynamically complex circulation bourret et al 2005 sommerfeld 1949 originally proposed the radiation condition and orlanski 1976 further generalized this condition the radiation condition is the foundation of the most widely used conditions in modern ocean models this orlanski type condition parameterizes propagating information across the open boundaries as nondispersive and unforced shallow water waves its equation is 1 ϕ t c ϕ n 0 where c is the propagation speed of the dependent variable ϕ and the subscripts t and n represent partial differentiation in time and horizontal space usually in the cross boundary direction respectively the orlanski type condition inspired numerous different schemes as summarized by chapman 1985 tsynkov 1998 palma and matano 1998 2000 and marsaleix et al 2006 these schemes in most cases are used to solve circulation without tidal forcing and their dynamics are defined by how c in eq 1 is determined and how the disturbances arriving at the open boundaries are treated blayo and debreu 2005 properly including the exterior solution with a sensible scheme for c with respect to the characteristics of the arriving disturbances facilitates a less reflective connection between the interior and exterior circulation and forms active radiation obcs gan and allen 2005 gan et al 2005 schemes that exclude the exterior solution forcing are passive radiation obcs blayo and debreu 2005 gan and allen 2005 suggested subtracting the exterior solution from the model s variables and solving for the global solution by using the orlanski type radiation in eq 1 the radiation obc was valid only for unforced flow in principle and effective for slow subtidally forced currents at the open boundary the radiation obc cannot solve for the circulation in an estuary or coastal waters where tidal forcing is amplified and where tidal and subtidal currents exist simultaneously reid and bodine 1968 presented that a wave propagating across a boundary can be sensibly simulated by specifying c g h in the two dimensional depth averaged momentum equation g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the water depth over the open boundary flather 1976 advanced reid and bodine s approach by including the tidal current oey and chen 1992 further included the subtidal elevation and current to form the widely used active flather type boundary condition fla obc for a barotropic current flowing perpendicular to an open boundary while fla obc effectively transmits tidal waves across the open boundary in a less reflective manner carter and merrifield 2007 the adaptability of the fla obc in simulating the subtidal currents for example wind and buoyancy discharges is questionable oddo and pinardi 2008 because of the dynamics on which fla obc is based the elevation and barotropic velocities are over specified by fla obc and spurious kinetic energy accumulates at the open boundaries to create rim currents that prevent a sensible connection between the interior and exterior solutions in the computational domain mason et al 2010 in addition fla obc has limited noise tolerance in the exterior solution and distorts the solutions in the baroclinic mode liu and gan 2016 the inability of the orlanski type and flather type obcs to sensibly resolve tidally and subtidally forced circulation across open boundaries in a limited area simulation motivated the development of active schemes that overcame the drawbacks of fla obc and the orlanski type obc mason et al 2010 proposed an improved fla obc that separates the circulation at the open boundaries into components generated by internally and externally sourced surface gravity waves they solve the internally sourced surface gravity waves by using passive schemes and the externally sourced ones by using active schemes with a specified c g h in this paper the mason et al 2010 scheme is called mas obc the tidally and subtidally forced open boundary condition tst obc developed by liu and gan 2016 resolves tidal and subtidal wave propagation across the open boundaries in a different way that is more physically sensible this research resolves tidal and subtidal signals by recognizing concurrently propagating tidal waves and subtidally generated disturbances and adapting the numerical and physical advantages of the obcs of oey and chen 1992 and gan and allen 2005 respectively the separate treatment of tidally and subtidally forced currents allows tst obc to be an active and dual wave transmitting scheme in which both tidal and subtidal dual wave transmitting disturbances are sensibly transmitted through the open boundary while the exterior solution from the upscale simulation is imposed however in liu and gan s study the tst obc was based on steady constant and spatially uniform wind and tidal forcing the reliability of tst obc in solving the tidal current and subtidal circulation driven by regional and remote forcing with extensive spatiotemporal variability was not investigated in our current study a multi domain downscaling simulation system that focuses on the circulation in the pearl river estuary and adjacent shelf waters l2 domain in fig 1 is developed to investigate the adaptability and accuracy of tst obc both field observations and circulation dynamics are used to validate the simulation system the study area is in the northern south china sea l1 domain in fig 1a which has a complicated coastline and bathymetry that stretches northeastward along the coast of guangdong province china the water depth in the l2 domain fig 1b is generally shallower than 70 m and the depth decreases shoreward the interior circulation and hydrodynamics in our domain are regulated by energetic spatially and temporally variable tidal zu et al 2008 and subtidal wind and river discharge forces gan et al 2009a b and external forces from the large scale slope and basin circulation of the connected l1 simulation gan et al 2016 these jointly imposed forces produce complicated circulation patterns in the area zu and gan 2015 implementing the obc so that the processes in the limited area domain could communicate with the processes in the larger scale domain is critical and challenging in this multi domain downscaling simulation system in this study the numerical and physical responses of tst obc to the spatiotemporally variable forcing of energetic and multi constituent tidal forcing strong shelf currents winds and buoyancy from river discharge are investigated it is shown that tst obc has advantages in simulating shelf and estuarine circulation when the circulation is jointly driven by spatiotemporal variable wind buoyancy forcing and tides 2 ocean model and tst obc 2 1 ocean model the regional ocean modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 rutgers branch http www myroms org is used for the downscaling simulations

from a hindcast simulation in the china seas multi scale modeling system l0 domain in fig 1 10 km https odmp ust hk cmoms gan et al 2016 to the l1 domain 3 km gan et al 2015 the daily averaged model results from the l1 simulation are used as exterior solutions for a high resolution simulation over the shelf in the l2 domain fig 1b the l2 domain has been horizontally discretized into a matrix with 400 441 points using an orthogonal curvilinear grid system the ultrahigh resolution 0 1 km resolves the estuary and the inner shelf that neighbors hong kong the grid size gradually increases to 1 km over the shelf at its southern boundary to smoothly connect with the circulation in the l1 domain in this study the circulation over the shelf of the l2 domain where the tidal and subtidal forces are amplified is examined the l1 and l2 models have 30 vertical levels on terrain following s coordinates song and haidvogel 1994 there are higher resolutions 0 2 m in the surface and bottom boundary layers the l2 domain has three open boundaries western eastern and southern connecting to the l1 domain fig 1b the l0 l1 and l2 simulations have been run from 2011 to 2015 to impose tidal forcing m 2

previously validated atmospheric forces from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf global reanalysis data are imposed by using the bulk formulation in fairall et al 2003 the atmospheric forcing interval is 3 h and the horizontal resolution of the forcing fields is 0 175 the pearl river discharge rate from the upstream hydrographic monitoring station at gaoyao is used in a daily forcing interval in this study we took advantage of having available in situ observations to validate our results field measurements over the northern southern china sea shelf during the summer of 2015 from july 1 to august 15 are conducted the observations include time series observations and ship based mapping at the stations shown in fig 1b at the mooring station a downward looking acoustic doppler current profiler adcp 600 khz on a surface buoy is deployed for about 1 5 months of velocity data temperature and salinity in the water column at the ship based mapping stations are measured with a conductivity temperature depth ctd profiler measured water levels from the tide gauge at waglan island southeast of hong kong fig 1b are used to evaluate the performance of tst obc in resolving propagating tidal waves and subtidal variability of sea surface elevation nasa s jet propulsion laboratory provided remotely sensed sea surface temperature sst from the daily global multi scale ultrahigh resolution sst dataset at 1 km resolution this sst observation is used to investigate the response of the shelf current to the jointly imposed tidal and subtidal forces at the sea surface 2 2 tst obc the model subdomains are linked by tst obc which as detailed in liu and gan 2016 separates the subtidal and tidal components of the cross boundary depth averaged velocity u tst obc also uses active schemes in the barotropic mode to solve for the components in this research the notations r and t represent the subtidal and tidal components of the barotropic velocities u normal to the open boundaries and are respectively expressed as u r b n 1 and u t b n 1 the notations in this section and relationships among the equations in this section are summarized in table 1 and the operation flowchart of tst obc is in table 2 the formula for tst obc is 2 u b n 1 u r b n δ t λ u r b n u r l b n u t l b n 1 g h η b n 1 η t l b n 1 η r l b n 1 c 0 u r l b n 1 1 1 c u r g b n c u r g b 1 n 1 u t l b n 1 g h η b n 1 η t l b n 1 η r l b n 1 c 0 λ which is one hour in this study is the relaxation time for the inflow condition with the phase speed of the disturbances c 0 in eq 2 g represents the global solution of tst obc therefore the global solution for tidal currents u t g b n 1 is 3 u t g b n 1 g h η b n 1 η t l b n 1 η r l b n 1 in which in eqs 2 and 3 depends on the boundary a negative sign denotes solving for barotropic velocities at the southern and western open boundaries and a positive sign denotes solving for barotropic velocities at the northern and eastern open boundaries switching tst obc for inward or outward propagating disturbances associated with subtidal current is determined by c which is the phase speed calculated from the global solutions of the orlanski type implicit radiation condition marchesiello et al 2001 therefore c is solved using 4 c u r g b 1 n u r g b 1 n 1 u r g b 1 n 1 u r g b 2 n 1 this expression shows that c depends on the barotropic velocities at two grids that are next to the open boundaries inside the computational domain to further elaborate the physical meaning of eq 2 and make the expression clearer the first term on the right hand side is defined as 5 u r b n 1 u r b n δ t λ u r b n u r l b n c 0 u r l b n 1 1 1 c u r g b n c u r g b 1 n 1 c 0 in which as stated previously u r l b n 1 stands for the daily and depth averaged velocity from the upscaled simulation eq 2 is then shortened and further clarified into 6 u b n 1 u r b n 1 u t l b n 1 u t g b n 1 to evaluate the function of the active radiation condition for the residual current in section 4 3 the global solution for subtidal current u r g b n 1 is computed with 7 u r g b n 1 u r b n 1 u r l b n 1 eq 7 is not explicitly used in the tst obc scheme using fla obc reveals the characteristics of tst obc the formula for fla obc is 8 u b n 1 u r l b n 1 u t l b n 1 u t g b n 1 eqs 6 and 8 as well as table 1 clearly show that the major difference between tst obc and fla obc is the solution for the subtidal current u r b n 1 for tst obc an active scheme in eq 5 taken from roed and smedstad 1984 is used the active scheme evacuates the non tidal disturbances u r g b n 1 in eq 7 and the exterior solutions u r l b n 1 preserve the dynamic similarity between the interior and exterior solutions because the latter solution is retrieved from solving the primitive equations without having to dynamically simplify much in the l1 domain the low subtidal and high tidal frequency disturbances are therefore solved in an active manner with a dual wave transmitting scheme in contrast fla obc specifies the exterior solutions at the open boundaries by using u r b n 1 u r l b n 1 the term u t g b n 1 in eq 8 only allows barotropic tidal waves to radiate across the open boundaries so using fla obc results in an active but single wave transmitting scheme tst obc can be applied to the three dimensional momentum equations by excluding the solution for barotropic tidal waves this treatment preserves the dynamic consistency between barotropic and baroclinic motions across the open boundaries as shown in table 1 to preserve that consistency through omitting the last term in the right hand side of eq 2 or 9 u b n 1 u r b n δ t λ u r b n u r l b n u t l b n 1 c 0 u r l b n 1 1 1 c u r g b n c u r g b 1 n 1 u t l b n 1 c 0 note that the depth averaged velocity u in eq 2 was replaced with the depth dependent velocity u except in the predicted tidal velocity u t l b n 1 based on eq 3 c is computed by using u for dynamic consistency in the problem an active scheme is used to solve for the temperature and salinity at the open boundaries as in liu and gan 2016 λ is set as 12 hours for the baroclinic velocities normal to the boundaries temperature and salinity in this study the advantages of using tst obc are summarized as being able to a decompose the subtidal and tidal dynamics and separate the exterior solution and global components of the subtidal flows normal to the boundaries according to their respective physical and numerical natures b apply active and dual wave transmitting schemes for tidal and subtidal currents c tolerate the discrepancy between solutions from the l2 and l1 domains through the global solution eq 7 d provide consistent adaptation among all barotropic and baroclinic variables in the obc to ensure dynamic consistency in the following sections of this paper the simulations using tst obc in the l1 and l2 domains are named p t s t and e t s t respectively the obc configurations for barotropic baroclinic velocities temperature and salinity in different experiments are summarized in table 3 3 the tidally and subtidally forced shelf circulation 3 1 the forcing conditions fig 2a and b show the horizontal distribution of wind vectors at 10 m above the sea surface and the standard deviation of the wind magnitude 95 confidence interval the wind field in fig 2a is the average over the field cruise period july 1 to august 15 2015 fig 2c illustrates the time series of zonal and meridional wind speed and the time series of its alongshore component averaged over the l2 domain a positive alongshore wind blew northeastward 22 8 to the east the time series of the pearl river discharge rate is in fig 2d and e shows the time series of the simulated and observed surface elevations at the tide gauge on waglan island fig 2a and b clearly show that the southwesterly summer monsoon prevailed during the field cruise the wind intensity was stronger offshore towards the central south china sea basin where its standard deviation was comparable to the wind magnitude both zonal and meridional winds demonstrated extensive variations in synoptic time scales manifested by abrupt wind speed changes from july 19 to july 21 when a short term and weak downwelling favorable northeasterly wind rapidly reversed to become upwelling favorable within a single day july 20 the strong buoyancy discharge from the pearl river influenced the subtidal circulation in the study area fig 2d zu et al 2014 and the average discharge rate at gaoyao station was 1 2 104 m3 s 1 consistent with typical summer conditions high frequency tidal forcing strongly influenced the estuarine shelf circulation in the study area fig 2e the dominant constituents were m 2 and k 1 zu et al 2008 and the tide amplified as it entered the shallower l2 domain 3 2 tidal dynamics the reliability of tst obc in solving high frequency tidal currents is at first examined fig 2e shows the agreement between the simulated tidal elevation at waglan island and the observed water levels the estimated correlation coefficient between the observed and simulated tidal elevation is 0 96 with 95 confidence interval the coefficient of determination r2 is greater than 0 83 and the root mean square error is smaller than 0 05 m harmonic analysis pawlowicz et al 2002 of the simulated surface elevation from e t s t allows us to extract the horizontal maps of amplitude and phase lag of the tidal elevation for m 2 and k 1 fig 3 the simulated harmonic constants are compared with the constants obtained from the otis dataset horizontal maps of the tidal amplitudes for m 2 and k 1 from the c t s t simulation and the otis observations clearly illustrate that the tides intensified shoreward and westward in the l2 domain fig 3 the maximum tidal amplitude over the inshore area of the western boundary exceeds 0 4 m the horizontal maps of phase lag further show that tidal waves propagate cyclonically over the shelf with k 1 traveling faster than m 2 now the observed and simulated tidal velocities at the adcp buoy location are examined the time series of the observed depth averaged meridional and zonal velocities at the buoy agrees well with the simulated ones the correlation coefficients between the simulated and long term recorded tidal velocities in both directions exceed 0 96 with 95 confidence interval the r2 value is greater than 0 90 and the root mean square error is smaller than 0 04 m s 1 these error analyses show the agreement between observations and simulation from e t s t this agreement between observed and simulated tidal data demonstrates the reliability of tst obc in accommodating tidal forcing that is imposed along the open boundaries of a computational domain fig 4 consistent with fig 3c and d the tidal current oscillated zonally the amplitude of the tidal current was over 0 3 0 15 m s 1 for the spring neap tides fig 4 also shows that although tides imposed the strongest fluctuation in the currents there was a notable subtidal current the subtidal current generally flowed northeastward when an upwelling favorable wind prevailed and weakened or reversed direction when strong downwelling favorable winds blew 3 3 subtidal shelf circulation the response of the shelf current to the subtidal forces of wind and buoyancy discharge is shown in the simulated surface and bottom velocity vectors and salinity distributions fig 5 fig 6a shows the satellite remote sensed sst averaged over the cruise period fig 6b displays the observed bottom temperature distribution obtained from the deepest ctd measurement at each station the simulated temperature distributions in the surface and bottom layers averaged over the cruise period in the l2 domain are shown in fig 6c and d respectively the t s diagrams of the observed and e t s t simulated temperature and salinity at each station are shown in fig 7a and the observed and simulated water temperatures are compared in fig 7b for all the stations to discuss the adaptability and reliability of tst obc further a sensitivity experiment is configured in the l2 domain that kept the dynamic implementation and numerical configuration in e t s t but switched to the recommended obc configurations in roms this case is named e r o m s table 3 it should be noted that fla obc is used to solve for barotropic velocity and the adaptive radiation condition in marchesiello et al 2001 is used to solve for the baroclinic velocities temperature and salinity in e r o m s the t s diagrams of the observed and simulated temperature and salinity and the comparison of the temperatures for all the stations from e r o m s are shown in fig 7c and d in fig 5a a pronounced northeastward shelf current appeared in response to the southwesterly wind forcing shown in fig 2a this current occupied the water over the shelf and extended to the bottom layer where there were upslope velocities fig 5b the shelf current intensified from the western to the eastern boundary and was stronger over the shelf in the lee of hong kong fig 5a the extensive buoyancy plume due to riverine freshwater discharged from the pearl river estuary caused the shelf current to be spatially variable fig 5c over the shelf the current intensified on the shore side of the density front due to the strengthened shoreward pressure gradient force while it weakened on the seaside liu et al 2018 this strengthening weakening pattern is consistent with the result obtained by gan et al 2009b in response to the upwelling deep shelf waters were advected upslope towards the coastal ocean which is seen in the simulated and observed temperature distributions fig 6 this upslope transport prevented the buoyant plume from being bottom advected over the shelf deeper than 20 m fig 5d and in response to the eastward strengthened coastal current fig 5a and b the onshore invasion of deep shelf waters strengthened eastward in the l2 domain figs 5d 6b and d these cold waters extended over the shelf in the surface layer in the lee of hong kong and formed a notable surface cold water belt fig 6a and c the e t s t simulated surface salinity further revealed that the buoyant river plume expanded bi directionally both eastward and westward and was enveloped by a sharp density front along its edge fig 5c and d the water inside the e t s t plume was fresher than the plume water from p t s t due to e t s t resolving the plume dynamics better the notable fluctuation around the 40 m isobath shows that this fresher plume meandered extensively in the western half of the computational domain fig 5c the thickness of this buoyant plume was 10 m and the westward branch of the buoyant water attached to the seabed over the inshore area fig 5d it is now clear that nested by tst obc the downscaling system captured the general characteristics of the tidal current and subtidal circulation in the study area the reliability of tst obc is elaborated with the time series of the sea surface height fig 2e and velocities fig 4 and by comparing the simulated and observed t s diagrams and temperature fields fig 7a and b the correlation coefficient between the observed and simulated temperature in the water column is 0 93 95 confidence interval and the r2 value is over 0 8 in e t s t a root mean square error analysis shows that the discrepancy between the e t s t simulation and field measurements is smaller than 1 2 c for temperature and 2 3 psu for salinity however when the recommended obc configuration in roms is adopted for e r o m s the correlation coefficient and r2 values reduce to 0 53 and 0 0 respectively fig 7 also clearly shows that for the e r o m s case not using tst obc causes the physical properties of the shelf water to deviate more from the observations fig 7c and excessive mixing occurs in the lower layers where there is a much larger discrepancy fig 7d 4 rationale of obcs in this section the performance of tst obc s response to variable forcing fig 2 for the cruise period is detailed to rationalize the success of tst obc in simulating tidal and subtidal currents two additional sensitivity experiments in the l2 domain are conducted by using fla obc and mas obc in the rutgers roms to solve for the barotropic velocities table 3 unlike e r o m s tst obc is used to solve for the baroclinic velocities temperature and salinity in these new experiments to avoid the disadvantages identified in our earlier e r o m s sensitivity experiment these two new sensitivity experiments are named as e f l a and e m a s because the simulations produced using mas obc and fla obc generated similar results see supplementary information we selected the e f l a simulation to compare to the results from e t s t the e f l a results are chosen because the physical meanings of the terms in the fla obc algorithm eq 8 are clearer 4 1 transparency of obcs fig 8 shows the horizontal maps of the depth averaged barotropic kinetic energy and normalized relative vorticity ξ f from e t s t e r o m s and e f l a the velocities over the cruise period before computing the kinetic energy and ξ f are averaged the results from the outer domain p t s t are also presented to illustrate the connection between the two models and to show the effectiveness of tst obc in bridging the two domains ξ was normalized by f coriolis parameter to represent the rossby number r o fig 9 shows the horizontal maps of kinetic energy and r o in e t s t e r o m s and e f l a and reveals more details of the solutions the horizontal maps of kinetic energy and r o show the sensible connection of the barotropic circulation between e t s t and p t s t and demonstrates the non reflective spurious kinetic energy along the open boundaries figs 8a and 9a the eastward shelf current whose core is over the 30 m isobath fig 5a and b alternated between positive and negative r o in the offshore direction at the western boundary figs 8d and 9d the shelf current near the eastern boundary responded to the eastward branch of the buoyant plume by strengthening fig 8a with positive r o over the inshore areas that are shallower than 30 m fig 8d when the recommended combination of obcs in roms is used the connection between e r o m s and p t s t produced excessive spurious kinetic energy along the three open boundaries of the l2 domain figs 8b and 9b these disturbances reflected and grew in the computational domain by creating extensive r o in e r o m s figs 8e and 9e to worsen the interior solutions in fig 7c and d this result suggests that when the recommended combination of obcs in roms are used without adopting the advantages of tst obc the boundary solutions and the interior circulation become contaminated mason et al 2010 on the other hand when tst obc is used to solve for the baroclinic velocities temperature and salinity fig 8c and f in e f l a the connections between the l2 and l1 solutions were better defined than in e r o m s the connections were better defined even when we used fla obc to solve for the barotropic velocities this finding shows that the l2 simulations improved when an active treatment of the baroclinic velocities temperature and salinity by tst obc is used however compared to the solutions from e t s t the results from e f l a still had excessively spurious kinetic energy that accumulated and created discontinuity between e f l a and p t s t over the western boundary fig 9c this energetic distortion caused by fla obc is clear in fig 9f where a strong offshore deflection of the shelf current indicated by a positive r o unrealistically occurred in addition the connection between e f l a and p t s t solutions was distorted over the southern boundary where a notable fake rim current mason et al 2010 was revealed by the heightened spurious kinetic energy fig 8c nonetheless e t s t and e f l a performed reasonably well along the up wave eastern boundary in the following sections of this paper results from e r o m s are no longer discussed because it was the worst at connecting the l1 and l2 simulations the contrasting baroclinic circulations from e t s t and p t s t along the western and eastern open boundaries are depicted by their depth dependent velocities figs 10 and 11 the velocities normal to the western and eastern open boundaries of e t s t and e f l a were weaker and less sheared than the velocities in p t s t at the down wave western boundary fig 10a c the baroclinic circulations generally agreed with each other at the up wave eastern boundary fig 11a c the solution of e f l a however had an unrealistically intensified eastward current in the bottom layer of the western boundary fig 10c the tangential velocity from e f l a had a very strong offshore rim current over the entire water column fig 10f but it was absent in p t s t and e t s t fig 10d and e along the western boundary of the l2 domain the unrealistic bottom intensified normal current and rim current indicate that fla obc deflected shelf currents at the down wave boundary this finding is consistent with the result revealed by the kinetic energy and r o in e f l a fig 8c and f like the normal velocity the tangential velocities among these three cases were quite consistent at the up wave eastern boundary fig 11d f the discrepancy between the l2 e t s t and e f l a and l1 p t s t domains mainly occurred at the western boundary in the following sections the discussion focuses on the effectiveness of the obcs in producing realistic circulation at the western boundary the density differences between e t s t and p t s t are shown in fig 12a and the density differences between e f l a and p t s t are in fig 12b fig 12c and d show the corresponding changes in velocities these velocities normal to the open boundaries are calculated by subtracting the barotropic velocities from the baroclinic velocities in the water column we averaged the properties shown in fig 12 over the cruise period the density differences 1 0 kg m 3 between l1 p t s t solution and those from e t s t and e f l a fig 12a and b were mainly caused by the strengthened westward propagation of the buoyant plume and weaker upslope invasion of shelf water associated with the upwelling circulation in e t s t and e f l a these differences in the density affected the baroclinic velocities by strengthening the eastward velocity in the buoyant plume and weakening the velocity in the lower layer fig 12c and d the contribution of the density structure to the baroclinic velocities was weaker in e t s t and e f l a than in p t s t not shown suggesting that when the model resolution increased the cross shore density gradient weakened and the velocity component normal to the boundary diminished because of the thermal wind dynamics it is clear that due to the adaptation of the active tst obc for tracers which is geostrophically consistent to the velocity fields in e t s t and e f l a the density field over the western boundary simulated the hydrographic structures well fig 12a and b however the responses of the baroclinic velocities in e t s t and e f l a were different although the impacts of the density field on the baroclinic velocities normal to the boundaries were comparable fig 12c and d the total baroclinic velocities were only sensibly simulated in e t s t fig 10b and were greatly distorted in e f l a fig 10c this leads us to conclude that the reflective barotropic solutions by fla obc fig 8c and f transmitted to the baroclinic velocities and undermined the connectivity between the l1 and l2 domains in e f l a transmitting excessive disturbances from the barotropic to the baroclinic circulation prevented a westward current from forming in the nearshore region of the western boundary fig 10b 4 2 time dependent obcs in this section the temporal response of kinetic energy and r o near the open boundaries 10 grid cells from the open boundaries to time dependent forcing fig 13 is investigated the absolute value of r o ξ f is used to prevent canceling positive and negative ξ when computing the time series in fig 11c and d fig 13a and b show that the variations of subtidal kinetic energy were more strongly regulated by the intensity of the wind fig 2c than by the buoyant discharge fig 2d the variations of wind and current have a correlation coefficient of 0 72 kinetic energy increased rapidly in e t s t and p t s t when the wind forcing transitioned from upwelling to downwelling favorable from july 19 to july 21 the intensified kinetic energy lasted about 10 days until july 30 fig 2c although the interior kinetic energy in e t s t varied in phase with the kinetic energy in p t s t and with comparable intensity fig 13b there was a larger discrepancy near the western boundary where the kinetic energy in e t s t no longer varied in phase with the kinetic energy from the exterior solution fig 13a this phase difference due to tst obc is clearer in the time series of r o in fig 13c and d it demonstrates that the dynamics of the computational domain modulated the solutions at the open boundaries although the regional subtidal forces from p t s t determined the solutions at the open boundaries of c t s t mason et al 2010 also pointed out that r o in e t s t is generally larger than r o in p t s t partially because increasing the resolution e t s t resolves more details of the flow structure fig 13a further shows that the reflective kinetic energy over the western open boundary of e f l a fig 8c was mainly from disturbances generated after the abrupt change of wind direction from july 19 to july 21 the fact that the kinetic energy at the western open boundary fig 13a and from the interior solution fig 13b of e f l a varied coherently in phase with the kinetic energy from p t s t indicates that the disturbances generated in the interior were not successfully transmitted by fla obc this lack of transmission contributed further to the spurious kinetic energy fig 13a and greatly increased the discontinuity fig 13c over the shelf neighboring the western boundary of e f l a from july 19 to july 21 the spurious kinetic energy along with the excessive disturbances endured for 10 days and undermined the connectivity between the l2 and l1 solutions the contrasting performance of tst obc and fla obc leads us to conclude that decomposing and active and dual wave transmitting for tidally and subtidally generated disturbances in tst obc effectively link tidal and subtidal flows in a less reflective manner than fla obc furthermore tst obc has a better response to time dependent forcing the consistent adaptation of schemes among the barotropic and baroclinic circulations temperature and salinity effectively ensures sensible dynamics in the downscaling system tst obc has the advantage of tolerating discrepancy between the e t s t and p t s t simulations by permitting internally generated disturbances to transmit by imposing phase differences in propagating disturbances between the l2 and l1 solutions 4 3 function of the obc dynamics in this section the contribution of each term in eqs 6 and 8 to the barotropic velocities normal to the western boundary are analyzed to determine the functioning mechanism of tst obc and fla obc over the western boundary of e t s t and e f l a the time series of total volume transport t r across the western boundary of the l2 domain from our p t s t e t s t and e f l a simulations are shown in fig 14a and the volume transports are defined as t r t s t p t r t s t e and t r f l a e with eqs 6 and 8 these transports are calculated by using the daily averaged u r l b n 1 and u b n 1 respectively fig 14b demonstrates the global solutions of the active tst obc and fla obc which are calculated from 10 t r t s t g e t r t s t e t r t s t p t r f l a g e t r f l a e t r t s t p t r t s t g e is determined by three terms u r b n 1 u t l b n 1 and u t g b n 1 in eq 6 and table 1 these terms are called t r t s t r g e t r t s t t l e and t r t s t t g e and their time series are shown in fig 14c a similar calculation is performed in e f l a t r f l a g e is calculated from u t l b n 1 and u t g b n 1 in eq 8 and the respective transports are called t r f l a t l e and t r f l a t g e the time series of these transports are shown in fig 14d fig 14a illustrates that the temporal variation of t r over the western boundary varied in phase with changes in the wind t r t s t e and t r f l a e were weaker than t r t s t p and were modulated by the negative global solutions t r t s t g e and t r f l a g e in fig 14b to facilitate the link between the l1 and l2 domain tst obc and fla obc transmitted a comparable number of disturbances through t r t s t t g e and t r f l a t g e fig 14c and d although there was a smaller difference in t r t s t t g e and t r f l a t g e t r t s t r g e varied in phase with t r t s t t g e and the wind fig 14c and d t r t s t r g e also provided stronger radiation for the disturbances that occurred during or after july 19 to july 21 when the wind abruptly changed from being weakly downwelling favorable to strongly upwelling favorable and when the kinetic energy increased extensively over the western boundary fig 13a the excessive disturbances illustrated by the barotropic kinetic energy fig 8a crossed the western boundary fig 14b with tst obc but were trapped at the western boundary with fla obc 5 conclusions a set of limited area numerical experiments is conducted to validate the performance of a recently developed active tst obc for estuarine shelf circulation jointly driven by spatiotemporally variable wind buoyancy forcing and tides in the northern south china sea tst obc is different from the frequently adopted obc schemes in roms because it separates the tidal and subtidal currents by recognizing their distinguishing characteristics and tst obc solves for the tidal and subtidal currents by using active schemes in our experiments tst obc concurrently evacuated the high frequency tidal component and low frequency subtidal component disturbances traveling across the open boundaries of the computational domain tst obc performed better than the frequently used schemes in roms in downscaling the concurrent tidal current and subtidal circulation in limited area simulations from an upscale model with lower resolution this study is built based on the work of liu and gan 2016 and further examined tst obc under variable forcing and over multiple domain nesting applications while liu and gan 2016 validated their experiment under idealized forcing in our study a three level downscaling system with increasing resolution from the south china sea to the pearl river estuary is developed tidal forces and subtidal forces with spatial and temporal variability and linked by tst obc drove the circulation in our downscaling system the estuarine shelf circulation neighboring the pearl river estuary where an ultra high resolution 0 2 1 0 km is adapted is focus of this research the simulations were validated with observations measured during a field cruise from july 1 to august 15 2015 this research finds found that the strong tidal and subtidal forces jointly drove the circulation inside this computational domain the subtidal forces included varying wind stress and river discharge that generated a notable buoyant plume enveloped by a sharp density front over the shelf off the pearl river estuary this research shows that tst obc consistently reproduces the tidal elevation and currents it is also confirmed that tst obc simulates the propagation of the high frequency rapidly propagating tidal waves across the limited area computational domain tst obc reproduces the variability in the observations with the simulations that show extensive upwelling of shelf waters and bi directional branching of the buoyant plume in the down wave and up wave directions when comparing t s diagrams of simulated and observed temperature and salinity the correlation coefficient was over 0 95 and the coefficient of determination was over 0 8 the observations and simulations consistently show that the subtidal flow is characterized by the predominant upwelling circulation with synaptic variations in response to wind forcing especially when the wind reverses direction from weak downwelling favorable to strong upwelling favorable the effectiveness and functioning mechanism of tst obc are investigated by examining the contribution of the terms in the governing equations and referring to results from the frequently used fla obc we showed that besides the effectiveness of tst obc on the barotropic velocity the shelf circulation and hydrographic properties in the l2 domain are greatly distorted when the baroclinic velocities temperature and salinity are not simultaneously solved by tst obc it is also clear that the improved fla obc by mason et al 2010 mas obc in the rutgers roms presents results like those from fla obc with our higher resolution the transport of shelf current normal to the boundary decreases because of the strengthened westward transport of the buoyant plume and the weakened upslope invasion of deep shelf waters the decrease in transport in tst obc is numerically and physically reproduced by its decomposing and active and dual waves transmitting schemes for the tidal current and subtidal circulation fla obc only evacuates disturbances over the open boundaries that are induced by tidal waves with fla obc disturbances induced by subtidal flows reside at the open boundaries in barotropic flows these fla obc disturbances distort the barotropic currents in the along boundary direction destroy the hydrodynamics associated with the upwelling circulation and contaminate the baroclinic component and interior solutions that contribute to the discontinuity between sub models this drawback of fla obc is overcome if a consistent adaptation of tst obc in barotropic and baroclinic circulations temperature and salinity occurs when tst obc for all parameters is consistently adapted doing so made the scheme tolerate discrepancies between the l1 and l2 solutions the consistent adaptation in tst obc numerically and dynamically links the circulation between sub models in a quasi seamless manner it should be noted that although tst obc is feasible for limited area numerical applications concurrently driven by extensive and spatiotemporally variable tidal and sub tidal forces tidal currents are imposed along the open boundaries by performing tidal prediction therefore harmonic constants for tidal elevation and currents are an important prerequisite for using tst obc moreover because the subtidal currents are extracted from the daily averaged velocities from its upscale exterior solution the adaptation of the tst obc scheme is limited to one way downscaling applications instead of interactive two way nesting simulations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

23985,we investigated the performance of a tidally and subtidally forced open boundary condition tst obc on the estuarine shelf circulation in a limited area down scaling numerical modeling system for the northern south china sea we forced the modeling system with amplified tidal forces and subtidal forcing of spatiotemporally variable wind and river discharge tst obc numerically and physically accommodates the circulation driven by the regional tides subtidal forces external forcing from its upscale solution and internally generated disturbances the advantages of tst obc are the separation of fast tidal and slow subtidal modes active and dual wave transmitting schemes consistent treatment of barotropic and baroclinic circulation and thermodynamic variables which enable the model to capture observed circulation characteristics the results differ from the results obtained using the flather type obc which over restores internal to external solutions with a notable accumulation of spurious disturbances along the open boundaries disturbances with both tidal and subtidal signals that arrive at the open boundaries are well treated by adopting tst obc although it is currently feasible for the one way downscaling applications 1 introduction in numerical simulations of ocean circulation in a size limited area the open boundary condition obc crucially impacts the interior solutions however implementing the obc is an ill posed problem oliger and sundström 1978 the reduced physics and simplified mathematics have led to improperly imposed external forces and reflective evacuation of internal disturbances at the open boundaries a wrongly adapted obc prevents a sensible connection between the internal and external forces and distorts the interior solution this distorted solution is greater in shelf simulations where strong tidal and subtidal forces drive the hydrodynamically complex circulation bourret et al 2005 sommerfeld 1949 originally proposed the radiation condition and orlanski 1976 further generalized this condition the radiation condition is the foundation of the most widely used conditions in modern ocean models this orlanski type condition parameterizes propagating information across the open boundaries as nondispersive and unforced shallow water waves its equation is 1 ϕ t c ϕ n 0 where c is the propagation speed of the dependent variable ϕ and the subscripts t and n represent partial differentiation in time and horizontal space usually in the cross boundary direction respectively the orlanski type condition inspired numerous different schemes as summarized by chapman 1985 tsynkov 1998 palma and matano 1998 2000 and marsaleix et al 2006 these schemes in most cases are used to solve circulation without tidal forcing and their dynamics are defined by how c in eq 1 is determined and how the disturbances arriving at the open boundaries are treated blayo and debreu 2005 properly including the exterior solution with a sensible scheme for c with respect to the characteristics of the arriving disturbances facilitates a less reflective connection between the interior and exterior circulation and forms active radiation obcs gan and allen 2005 gan et al 2005 schemes that exclude the exterior solution forcing are passive radiation obcs blayo and debreu 2005 gan and allen 2005 suggested subtracting the exterior solution from the model s variables and solving for the global solution by using the orlanski type radiation in eq 1 the radiation obc was valid only for unforced flow in principle and effective for slow subtidally forced currents at the open boundary the radiation obc cannot solve for the circulation in an estuary or coastal waters where tidal forcing is amplified and where tidal and subtidal currents exist simultaneously reid and bodine 1968 presented that a wave propagating across a boundary can be sensibly simulated by specifying c g h in the two dimensional depth averaged momentum equation g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the water depth over the open boundary flather 1976 advanced reid and bodine s approach by including the tidal current oey and chen 1992 further included the subtidal elevation and current to form the widely used active flather type boundary condition fla obc for a barotropic current flowing perpendicular to an open boundary while fla obc effectively transmits tidal waves across the open boundary in a less reflective manner carter and merrifield 2007 the adaptability of the fla obc in simulating the subtidal currents for example wind and buoyancy discharges is questionable oddo and pinardi 2008 because of the dynamics on which fla obc is based the elevation and barotropic velocities are over specified by fla obc and spurious kinetic energy accumulates at the open boundaries to create rim currents that prevent a sensible connection between the interior and exterior solutions in the computational domain mason et al 2010 in addition fla obc has limited noise tolerance in the exterior solution and distorts the solutions in the baroclinic mode liu and gan 2016 the inability of the orlanski type and flather type obcs to sensibly resolve tidally and subtidally forced circulation across open boundaries in a limited area simulation motivated the development of active schemes that overcame the drawbacks of fla obc and the orlanski type obc mason et al 2010 proposed an improved fla obc that separates the circulation at the open boundaries into components generated by internally and externally sourced surface gravity waves they solve the internally sourced surface gravity waves by using passive schemes and the externally sourced ones by using active schemes with a specified c g h in this paper the mason et al 2010 scheme is called mas obc the tidally and subtidally forced open boundary condition tst obc developed by liu and gan 2016 resolves tidal and subtidal wave propagation across the open boundaries in a different way that is more physically sensible this research resolves tidal and subtidal signals by recognizing concurrently propagating tidal waves and subtidally generated disturbances and adapting the numerical and physical advantages of the obcs of oey and chen 1992 and gan and allen 2005 respectively the separate treatment of tidally and subtidally forced currents allows tst obc to be an active and dual wave transmitting scheme in which both tidal and subtidal dual wave transmitting disturbances are sensibly transmitted through the open boundary while the exterior solution from the upscale simulation is imposed however in liu and gan s study the tst obc was based on steady constant and spatially uniform wind and tidal forcing the reliability of tst obc in solving the tidal current and subtidal circulation driven by regional and remote forcing with extensive spatiotemporal variability was not investigated in our current study a multi domain downscaling simulation system that focuses on the circulation in the pearl river estuary and adjacent shelf waters l2 domain in fig 1 is developed to investigate the adaptability and accuracy of tst obc both field observations and circulation dynamics are used to validate the simulation system the study area is in the northern south china sea l1 domain in fig 1a which has a complicated coastline and bathymetry that stretches northeastward along the coast of guangdong province china the water depth in the l2 domain fig 1b is generally shallower than 70 m and the depth decreases shoreward the interior circulation and hydrodynamics in our domain are regulated by energetic spatially and temporally variable tidal zu et al 2008 and subtidal wind and river discharge forces gan et al 2009a b and external forces from the large scale slope and basin circulation of the connected l1 simulation gan et al 2016 these jointly imposed forces produce complicated circulation patterns in the area zu and gan 2015 implementing the obc so that the processes in the limited area domain could communicate with the processes in the larger scale domain is critical and challenging in this multi domain downscaling simulation system in this study the numerical and physical responses of tst obc to the spatiotemporally variable forcing of energetic and multi constituent tidal forcing strong shelf currents winds and buoyancy from river discharge are investigated it is shown that tst obc has advantages in simulating shelf and estuarine circulation when the circulation is jointly driven by spatiotemporal variable wind buoyancy forcing and tides 2 ocean model and tst obc 2 1 ocean model the regional ocean modeling system roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 rutgers branch http www myroms org is used for the downscaling simulations

over the shelf at its southern boundary to smoothly connect with the circulation in the l1 domain in this study the circulation over the shelf of the l2 domain where the tidal and subtidal forces are amplified is examined the l1 and l2 models have 30 vertical levels on terrain following s coordinates song and haidvogel 1994 there are higher resolutions 0 2 m in the surface and bottom boundary layers the l2 domain has three open boundaries western eastern and southern connecting to the l1 domain fig 1b the l0 l1 and l2 simulations have been run from 2011 to 2015 to impose tidal forcing m 2

previously validated atmospheric forces from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf global reanalysis data are imposed by using the bulk formulation in fairall et al 2003 the atmospheric forcing interval is 3 h and the horizontal resolution of the forcing fields is 0 175 the pearl river discharge rate from the upstream hydrographic monitoring station at gaoyao is used in a daily forcing interval in this study we took advantage of having available in situ observations to validate our results field measurements over the northern southern china sea shelf during the summer

scale ultrahigh resolution sst dataset at 1 km resolution this sst observation is used to investigate the response of the shelf current to the jointly imposed tidal and subtidal forces at the sea surface 2 2 tst obc the model subdomains are linked by tst obc which as detailed in liu and gan 2016 separates the subtidal and tidal components of the cross boundary depth averaged velocity u tst obc also uses active schemes in the barotropic mode to solve for the components in this research the notations r and t represent the subtidal and tidal components of the barotropic velocities u normal to the open boundaries and are respectively expressed as u r b n 1 and u t b n 1 the notations in this section and relationships among the equations in this section are summarized in table 1 and the operation flowchart of tst obc is in table 2 the formula for tst obc is 2 u b n 1 u r b n δ t λ u r b n u r l b n u t l b n 1 g h η b n 1 η t l b n 1 η r l b n 1 c 0 u r l b n 1 1 1 c u r g b n c u r g b 1 n 1 u t l b n 1 g h η b n 1 η t l b n 1 η r l b n 1 c 0 λ which is one hour in this study is the relaxation time for the inflow condition with the phase speed of the disturbances c 0 in eq 2 g represents the global solution of tst obc therefore the global solution for tidal currents u t g b n 1 is 3 u t g b n 1 g h η b n 1 η t l b n 1 η r l b n 1 in which in eqs 2 and 3 depends on the boundary a negative sign denotes solving for barotropic velocities at the southern and western open boundaries and a positive sign denotes solving for barotropic velocities at the northern and eastern open boundaries switching tst obc for inward or outward propagating disturbances associated with subtidal current is determined by c which is the phase speed calculated from the global solutions of the orlanski type implicit radiation condition marchesiello et al 2001 therefore c is solved using 4 c u r g b 1 n u r g b 1 n 1 u r g b 1 n 1 u r g b 2 n 1 this expression shows that c depends on the barotropic velocities at two grids that are next to the open boundaries inside the computational domain to further elaborate the physical meaning of eq 2 and make the expression clearer the first term on the right hand side is defined as 5 u r b n 1 u r b n δ t λ u r b n u r l b n c 0 u r l b n 1 1 1 c u r g b n c u r g b 1 n 1 c 0 in which as stated previously u r l b n 1 stands for the daily and depth averaged velocity from the upscaled simulation eq 2 is then shortened and further clarified into 6 u b n 1 u r b n 1 u t l b n 1 u t g b n 1 to evaluate the function of the active radiation condition for the residual current in section 4 3 the global solution for subtidal current u r g b n 1 is computed with 7 u r g b n 1 u r b n 1 u r l b n 1 eq 7 is not explicitly used in the tst obc scheme using fla obc reveals the characteristics of tst obc the formula for fla obc is 8 u b n 1 u r l b n 1 u t l b n 1 u t g b n 1 eqs 6 and 8 as well as table 1 clearly show that the major difference between tst obc and fla obc is the solution for the subtidal current u r b n 1 for tst obc an active scheme in eq 5 taken from roed and smedstad 1984 is used the active scheme evacuates the non tidal disturbances u r g b n 1 in eq 7 and the exterior solutions u r l b n 1 preserve the dynamic similarity between the interior and exterior solutions because the latter solution is retrieved from solving the primitive equations without having to dynamically simplify much in the l1 domain the low subtidal and high tidal frequency disturbances are therefore solved in an active manner with a dual wave transmitting scheme in contrast fla obc specifies the exterior solutions at the open boundaries by using u r b n 1 u r l b n 1 the term u t g b n 1 in eq 8 only allows barotropic tidal waves to radiate across the open boundaries so using fla obc results in an active but single wave transmitting scheme tst obc can be applied to the three dimensional momentum equations by excluding the solution for barotropic tidal waves this treatment preserves the dynamic consistency between barotropic and baroclinic motions across the open boundaries as shown in table 1 to preserve that consistency through omitting the last term in the right hand side of eq 2 or 9 u b n 1 u r b n δ t λ u r b n u r l b n u t l b n 1 c 0 u r l b n 1 1 1 c u r g b n c u r g b 1 n 1 u t l b n 1 c 0 note that the depth averaged velocity u in eq 2 was replaced with the depth dependent velocity u except in the predicted tidal velocity u t l b n 1 based on eq 3 c is computed by using u for dynamic consistency in the problem an active scheme is used to solve for the temperature and salinity at the open boundaries as in liu and gan 2016 λ is set as 12 hours for the baroclinic velocities normal to the boundaries temperature and salinity in this study the advantages of using tst obc are summarized as being able to a decompose the subtidal and tidal dynamics and separate the exterior solution and global components of the subtidal flows normal to the boundaries according to their respective physical and numerical natures b apply active and dual wave transmitting schemes for tidal and subtidal currents c tolerate the discrepancy between solutions from the l2 and l1 domains through the global solution eq 7 d provide consistent adaptation among all barotropic and baroclinic variables in the obc to ensure dynamic consistency in the following sections of this paper the simulations using tst obc in the l1 and l2 domains are named p t s t and e t s t respectively the obc configurations for barotropic baroclinic velocities temperature and salinity in different experiments are summarized in table 3 3 the tidally and subtidally forced shelf circulation 3 1 the forcing conditions fig 2a and b show the horizontal distribution of wind vectors at 10 m above the sea surface and the standard deviation of the wind magnitude 95 confidence interval the wind field in fig 2a is the average over the field cruise period july 1 to august 15 2015 fig 2c illustrates the time series of zonal and meridional wind speed and the time series of its alongshore component averaged over the l2 domain a positive alongshore wind blew northeastward 22 8 to the east the time series of the pearl river discharge rate is in fig 2d and e shows the time series of the simulated and observed surface elevations at the tide gauge on waglan island fig 2a and b clearly show that the southwesterly summer monsoon prevailed during the field cruise the wind intensity was stronger offshore towards the central south china sea basin where its standard deviation was comparable to the wind magnitude both zonal and meridional winds demonstrated extensive variations in synoptic time scales manifested by abrupt wind speed changes from july 19 to july 21 when a short term and weak downwelling favorable northeasterly wind rapidly reversed to become upwelling favorable within a single day july 20 the strong buoyancy discharge from the pearl river influenced the subtidal circulation in the study area fig 2d zu et al 2014 and the average discharge rate at gaoyao station was 1 2 104 m3 s 1 consistent with typical summer conditions high frequency tidal forcing strongly influenced the estuarine shelf circulation in the study area fig 2e the dominant constituents were m 2 and k 1 zu et al 2008 and the tide amplified as it entered the shallower l2 domain 3 2 tidal dynamics the reliability of tst obc in solving high frequency tidal currents is at first examined fig 2e shows the agreement between the simulated tidal elevation at waglan island and the observed water levels the estimated correlation coefficient between the observed and simulated tidal elevation is 0 96 with 95 confidence interval the coefficient of determination r2 is greater than 0 83 and the root mean square error is smaller than 0 05 m harmonic analysis pawlowicz et al 2002 of the simulated surface elevation from e t s t allows us to extract the horizontal maps of amplitude and phase lag of the tidal elevation for m 2 and k 1 fig 3 the simulated harmonic constants are compared with the constants obtained from the otis dataset horizontal maps of the tidal amplitudes for m 2 and k 1 from the c t s t simulation and the otis observations clearly illustrate that the tides intensified shoreward and westward in the l2 domain fig 3 the maximum tidal amplitude over the inshore area of the western boundary exceeds 0 4 m the horizontal maps of phase lag further show that tidal waves propagate cyclonically over the shelf with k 1 traveling faster than m 2 now the observed and simulated tidal velocities at the adcp buoy location are examined the time series of the observed depth averaged meridional and zonal velocities at the buoy agrees well with the simulated ones the correlation coefficients between the simulated and long term recorded tidal velocities in both directions exceed 0 96 with 95 confidence interval the r2 value is greater than 0 90 and the root mean square error is smaller than 0 04 m s 1 these error analyses show the agreement between observations and simulation from e t s t this agreement between observed and simulated tidal data demonstrates the reliability of tst obc in accommodating tidal forcing that is imposed along the open boundaries of a computational domain fig 4 consistent with fig 3c and d the tidal current oscillated zonally the amplitude of the tidal current was over 0 3 0 15 m s 1 for the spring neap tides fig 4 also shows that although tides imposed the strongest fluctuation in the currents there was a notable subtidal current the subtidal current generally flowed northeastward when an upwelling favorable wind prevailed and weakened or reversed direction when strong downwelling favorable winds blew 3 3 subtidal shelf circulation the response of the shelf current to the subtidal forces of wind and buoyancy discharge is shown in the simulated surface and bottom velocity vectors and salinity distributions fig 5 fig 6a shows the satellite remote sensed sst averaged over the cruise period fig 6b displays the observed bottom temperature distribution obtained from the deepest ctd measurement at each station the simulated temperature distributions in the surface and bottom layers averaged over the cruise period in the l2 domain are shown in fig 6c and d respectively the t s diagrams of the observed and e t s t simulated temperature and salinity at each station are shown in fig 7a and the observed and simulated water temperatures are compared in fig 7b for all the stations to discuss the adaptability and reliability of tst obc further a sensitivity experiment is configured in the l2 domain that kept the dynamic implementation and numerical configuration in e t s t but switched to the recommended obc configurations in roms this case is named e r o m s table 3 it should be noted that fla obc is used to solve for barotropic velocity and the adaptive radiation condition in marchesiello et al 2001 is used to solve for the baroclinic velocities temperature and salinity in e r o m s the t s diagrams of the observed and simulated temperature and salinity and the comparison of the temperatures for all the stations from e r o m s are shown in fig 7c and d in fig 5a a pronounced northeastward shelf current appeared in response to the southwesterly wind forcing shown in fig 2a this current occupied the water over the shelf and extended to the bottom layer where there were upslope velocities fig 5b the shelf current intensified from the western to the eastern boundary and was stronger over the shelf in the lee of hong kong fig 5a the extensive buoyancy plume due to riverine freshwater discharged from the pearl river estuary caused the shelf current to be spatially variable fig 5c over the shelf the current intensified on the shore side of the density front due to the strengthened shoreward pressure gradient force while it weakened on the seaside liu et al 2018 this strengthening weakening pattern is consistent with the result obtained by gan et al 2009b in response to the upwelling deep shelf waters were advected upslope towards the coastal ocean which is seen in the simulated and observed temperature distributions fig 6 this upslope transport prevented the buoyant plume from being bottom advected over the shelf deeper than 20 m fig 5d and in response to the eastward strengthened coastal current fig 5a and b the onshore invasion of deep shelf waters strengthened eastward in the l2 domain figs 5d 6b and d these cold waters extended over the shelf in the surface layer in the lee of hong kong and formed a notable surface cold water belt fig 6a and c the e t s t simulated surface salinity further revealed that the buoyant river plume expanded bi directionally both eastward and westward and was enveloped by a sharp density front along its edge fig 5c and d the water inside the e t s t plume was fresher than the plume water from p t s t due to e t s t resolving the plume dynamics better the notable fluctuation around the 40 m isobath shows that this fresher plume meandered extensively in the western half of the computational domain fig 5c the thickness of this buoyant plume was 10 m and the westward branch of the buoyant water attached to the seabed over the inshore area fig 5d it is now clear that nested by tst obc the downscaling system captured the general characteristics of the tidal current and subtidal circulation in the study area the reliability of tst obc is elaborated with the time series of the sea surface height fig 2e and velocities fig 4 and by comparing the simulated and observed t s diagrams and temperature fields fig 7a and b the correlation coefficient between the observed and simulated temperature in the water column is 0 93 95 confidence interval and the r2 value is over 0 8 in e t s t a root mean square error analysis shows that the discrepancy between the e t s t simulation and field measurements is smaller than 1 2 c for temperature and 2 3 psu for salinity however when the recommended obc configuration in roms is adopted for e r o m s the correlation coefficient and r2 values reduce to 0 53 and 0 0 respectively fig 7 also clearly shows that for the e r o m s case not using tst obc causes the physical properties of the shelf water to deviate more from the observations fig 7c and excessive mixing occurs in the lower layers where there is a much larger discrepancy fig 7d 4 rationale of obcs in this section the performance of tst obc s response to variable forcing fig 2 for the cruise period is detailed to rationalize the success of tst obc in simulating tidal and subtidal currents two additional sensitivity experiments in the l2 domain are conducted by using fla obc and mas obc in the rutgers roms to solve for the barotropic velocities table 3 unlike e r o m s tst obc is used to solve for the baroclinic velocities temperature and salinity in these new experiments to avoid the disadvantages identified in our earlier e r o m s sensitivity experiment these two new sensitivity experiments are named as e f l a and e m a s because the simulations produced using mas obc and fla obc generated similar results see supplementary information we selected the e f l a simulation to compare to the results from e t s t the e f l a results are chosen because the physical meanings of the terms in the fla obc algorithm eq 8 are clearer 4 1 transparency of obcs fig 8 shows the horizontal maps of the depth averaged barotropic kinetic energy and normalized relative vorticity ξ f from e t s t e r o m s and e f l a the velocities over the cruise period before computing the kinetic energy and ξ f are averaged the results from the outer domain p t s t are also presented to illustrate the connection between the two models and to show the effectiveness of tst obc in bridging the two domains ξ was normalized by f coriolis parameter to represent the rossby number r o fig 9 shows the horizontal maps of kinetic energy and r o in e t s t e r o m s and e f l a and reveals more details of the solutions the horizontal maps of kinetic energy and r o show the sensible connection of the barotropic circulation between e t s t and p t s t and demonstrates the non reflective spurious kinetic energy along the open boundaries figs 8a and 9a the eastward shelf current whose core is over the 30 m isobath fig 5a and b alternated between positive and negative r o in the offshore direction at the western boundary figs 8d and 9d the shelf current near the eastern boundary responded to the eastward branch of the buoyant plume by strengthening fig 8a with positive r o over the inshore areas that are shallower than 30 m fig 8d when the recommended combination of obcs in roms is used the connection between e r o m s and p t s t produced excessive spurious kinetic energy along the three open boundaries of the l2 domain figs 8b and 9b these disturbances reflected and grew in the computational domain by creating extensive r o in e r o m s figs 8e and 9e to worsen the interior solutions in fig 7c and d this result suggests that when the recommended combination of obcs in roms are used without adopting the advantages of tst obc the boundary solutions and the interior circulation become contaminated mason et al 2010 on the other hand when tst obc is used to solve for the baroclinic velocities temperature and salinity fig 8c and f in e f l a the connections between the l2 and l1 solutions were better defined than in e r o m s the connections were better defined even when we used fla obc to solve for the barotropic velocities this finding shows that the l2 simulations improved when an active treatment of the baroclinic velocities temperature and salinity by tst obc is used however compared to the solutions from e t s t the results from e f l a still had excessively spurious kinetic energy that accumulated and created discontinuity between e f l a and p t s t over the western boundary fig 9c this energetic distortion caused by fla obc is clear in fig 9f where a strong offshore deflection of the shelf current indicated by a positive r o unrealistically occurred in addition the connection between e f l a and p t s t solutions was distorted over the southern boundary where a notable fake rim current mason et al 2010 was revealed by the heightened spurious kinetic energy fig 8c nonetheless e t s t and e f l a performed reasonably well along the up wave eastern boundary in the following sections of this paper results from e r o m s are no longer discussed because it was the worst at connecting the l1 and l2 simulations the contrasting baroclinic circulations from e t s t and p t s t along the western and eastern open boundaries are depicted by their depth dependent velocities figs 10 and 11 the velocities normal to the western and eastern open boundaries of e t s t and e f l a were weaker and less sheared than the velocities in p t s t at the down wave western boundary fig 10a c the baroclinic circulations generally agreed with each other at the up wave eastern boundary fig 11a c the solution of e f l a however had an unrealistically intensified eastward current in the bottom layer of the western boundary fig 10c the tangential velocity from e f l a had a very strong offshore rim current over the entire water column fig 10f but it was absent in p t s t and e t s t fig 10d and e along the western boundary of the l2 domain the unrealistic bottom intensified normal current and rim current indicate that fla obc deflected shelf currents at the down wave boundary this finding is consistent with the result revealed by the kinetic energy and r o in e f l a fig 8c and f like the normal velocity the tangential velocities among these three cases were quite consistent at the up wave eastern boundary fig 11d f the discrepancy between the l2 e t s t and e f l a and l1 p t s t domains mainly occurred at the western boundary in the following sections the discussion focuses on the effectiveness of the obcs in producing realistic circulation at the western boundary the density differences between e t s t and p t s t are shown in fig 12a and the density differences between e f l a and p t s t are in fig 12b fig 12c and d show the corresponding changes in velocities these velocities normal to the open boundaries are calculated by subtracting the barotropic velocities from the baroclinic velocities in the water column we averaged the properties shown in fig 12 over the cruise period the density differences 1 0 kg m 3 between l1 p t s t solution and those from e t s t and e f l a fig 12a and b were mainly caused by the strengthened westward propagation of the buoyant plume and weaker upslope invasion of shelf water associated with the upwelling circulation in e t s t and e f l a these differences in the density affected the baroclinic velocities by strengthening the eastward velocity in the buoyant plume and weakening the velocity in the lower layer fig 12c and d the contribution of the density structure to the baroclinic velocities was weaker in e t s t and e f l a than in p t s t not shown suggesting that when the model resolution increased the cross shore density gradient weakened and the velocity component normal to the boundary diminished because of the thermal wind dynamics it is clear that due to the adaptation of the active tst obc for tracers which is geostrophically consistent to the velocity fields in e t s t and e f l a the density field over the western boundary simulated the hydrographic structures well fig 12a and b however the responses of the baroclinic velocities in e t s t and e f l a were different although the impacts of the density field on the baroclinic velocities normal to the boundaries were comparable fig 12c and d the total baroclinic velocities were only sensibly simulated in e t s t fig 10b and were greatly distorted in e f l a fig 10c this leads us to conclude that the reflective barotropic solutions by fla obc fig 8c and f transmitted to the baroclinic velocities and undermined the connectivity between the l1 and l2 domains in e f l a transmitting excessive disturbances from the barotropic to the baroclinic circulation prevented a westward current from forming in the nearshore region of the western boundary fig 10b 4 2 time dependent obcs in this section the temporal response of kinetic energy and r o near the open boundaries 10 grid cells from the open boundaries to time dependent forcing fig 13 is investigated the absolute value of r o ξ f is used to prevent canceling positive and negative ξ when computing the time series in fig 11c and d fig 13a and b show that the variations of subtidal kinetic energy were more strongly regulated by the intensity of the wind fig 2c than by the buoyant discharge fig 2d the variations of wind and current have a correlation coefficient of 0 72 kinetic energy increased rapidly in e t s t and p t s t when the wind forcing transitioned from upwelling to downwelling favorable from july 19 to july 21 the intensified kinetic energy lasted about 10 days until july 30 fig 2c although the interior kinetic energy in e t s t varied in phase with the kinetic energy in p t s t and with comparable intensity fig 13b there was a larger discrepancy near the western boundary where the kinetic energy in e t s t no longer varied in phase with the kinetic energy from the exterior solution fig 13a this phase difference due to tst obc is clearer in the time series of r o in fig 13c and d it demonstrates that the dynamics of the computational domain modulated the solutions at the open boundaries although the regional subtidal forces from p t s t determined the solutions at the open boundaries of c t s t mason et al 2010 also pointed out that r o in e t s t is generally larger than r o in p t s t partially because increasing the resolution e t s t resolves more details of the flow structure fig 13a further shows that the reflective kinetic energy over the western open boundary of e f l a fig 8c was mainly from disturbances generated after the abrupt change of wind direction from july 19 to july 21 the fact that the kinetic energy at the western open boundary fig 13a and from the interior solution fig 13b of e f l a varied coherently in phase with the kinetic energy from p t s t indicates that the disturbances generated in the interior were not successfully transmitted by fla obc this lack of transmission contributed further to the spurious kinetic energy fig 13a and greatly increased the discontinuity fig 13c over the shelf neighboring the western boundary of e f l a from july 19 to july 21 the spurious kinetic energy along with the excessive disturbances endured for 10 days and undermined the connectivity between the l2 and l1 solutions the contrasting performance of tst obc and fla obc leads us to conclude that decomposing and active and dual wave transmitting for tidally and subtidally generated disturbances in tst obc effectively link tidal and subtidal flows in a less reflective manner than fla obc furthermore tst obc has a better response to time dependent forcing the consistent adaptation of schemes among the barotropic and baroclinic circulations temperature and salinity effectively ensures sensible dynamics in the downscaling system tst obc has the advantage of tolerating discrepancy between the e t s t and p t s t simulations by permitting internally generated disturbances to transmit by imposing phase differences in propagating disturbances between the l2 and l1 solutions 4 3 function of the obc dynamics in this section the contribution of each term in eqs 6 and 8 to the barotropic velocities normal to the western boundary are analyzed to determine the functioning mechanism of tst obc and fla obc over the western boundary of e t s t and e f l a the time series of total volume transport t r across the western boundary of the l2 domain from our p t s t e t s t and e f l a simulations are shown in fig 14a and the volume transports are defined as t r t s t p t r t s t e and t r f l a e with eqs 6 and 8 these transports are calculated by using the daily averaged u r l b n 1 and u b n 1 respectively fig 14b demonstrates the global solutions of the active tst obc and fla obc which are calculated from 10 t r t s t g e t r t s t e t r t s t p t r f l a g e t r f l a e t r t s t p t r t s t g e is determined by three terms u r b n 1 u t l b n 1 and u t g b n 1 in eq 6 and table 1 these terms are called t r t s t r g e t r t s t t l e and t r t s t t g e and their time series are shown in fig 14c a similar calculation is performed in e f l a t r f l a g e is calculated from u t l b n 1 and u t g b n 1 in eq 8 and the respective transports are called t r f l a t l e and t r f l a t g e the time series of these transports are shown in fig 14d fig 14a illustrates that the temporal variation of t r over the western boundary varied in phase with changes in the wind t r t s t e and t r f l a e were weaker than t r t s t p and were modulated by the negative global solutions t r t s t g e and t r f l a g e in fig 14b to facilitate the link between the l1 and l2 domain tst obc and fla obc transmitted a comparable number of disturbances through t r t s t t g e and t r f l a t g e fig 14c and d although there was a smaller difference in t r t s t t g e and t r f l a t g e t r t s t r g e varied in phase with t r t s t t g e and the wind fig 14c and d t r t s t r g e also provided stronger radiation for the disturbances that occurred during or after july 19 to july 21 when the wind abruptly changed from being weakly downwelling favorable to strongly upwelling favorable and when the kinetic energy increased extensively over the western boundary fig 13a the excessive disturbances illustrated by the barotropic kinetic energy fig 8a crossed the western boundary fig 14b with tst obc but were trapped at the western boundary with fla obc 5 conclusions a set of limited area numerical experiments is conducted to validate the performance of a recently developed active tst obc for estuarine shelf circulation jointly driven by spatiotemporally variable wind buoyancy forcing and tides in the northern south china sea tst obc is different from the frequently adopted obc schemes in roms because it separates the tidal and subtidal currents by recognizing their distinguishing characteristics and tst obc solves for the tidal and subtidal currents by using active schemes in our experiments tst obc concurrently evacuated the high frequency tidal component and low frequency subtidal component disturbances traveling across the open boundaries of the computational domain tst obc performed better than the frequently used schemes in roms in downscaling the concurrent tidal current and subtidal circulation in limited area simulations from an upscale model with lower resolution this study is built based on the work of liu and gan 2016 and further examined tst obc under variable forcing and over multiple domain nesting applications while liu and gan 2016 validated their experiment under idealized forcing in our study a three level downscaling system with increasing resolution from the south china sea to the pearl river estuary is developed tidal forces and subtidal forces with spatial and temporal variability and linked by tst obc drove the circulation in our downscaling system the estuarine shelf circulation neighboring the pearl river estuary where an ultra high resolution 0 2 1 0 km is adapted is focus of this research the simulations were validated with observations measured during a field cruise from july 1 to august 15 2015 this research finds found that the strong tidal and subtidal forces jointly drove the circulation inside this computational domain the subtidal forces included varying wind stress and river discharge that generated a notable buoyant plume enveloped by a sharp density front over the shelf off the pearl river estuary this research shows that tst obc consistently reproduces the tidal elevation and currents it is also confirmed that tst obc simulates the propagation of the high frequency rapidly propagating tidal waves across the limited area computational domain tst obc reproduces the variability in the observations with the simulations that show extensive upwelling of shelf waters and bi directional branching of the buoyant plume in the down wave and up wave directions when comparing t s diagrams of simulated and observed temperature and salinity the correlation coefficient was over 0 95 and the coefficient of determination was over 0 8 the observations and simulations consistently show that the subtidal flow is characterized by the predominant upwelling circulation with synaptic variations in response to wind forcing especially when the wind reverses direction from weak downwelling favorable to strong upwelling favorable the effectiveness and functioning mechanism of tst obc are investigated by examining the contribution of the terms in the governing equations and referring to results from the frequently used fla obc we showed that besides the effectiveness of tst obc on the barotropic velocity the shelf circulation and hydrographic properties in the l2 domain are greatly distorted when the baroclinic velocities temperature and salinity are not simultaneously solved by tst obc it is also clear that the improved fla obc by mason et al 2010 mas obc in the rutgers roms presents results like those from fla obc with our higher resolution the transport of shelf current normal to the boundary decreases because of the strengthened westward transport of the buoyant plume and the weakened upslope invasion of deep shelf waters the decrease in transport in tst obc is numerically and physically reproduced by its decomposing and active and dual waves transmitting schemes for the tidal current and subtidal circulation fla obc only evacuates disturbances over the open boundaries that are induced by tidal waves with fla obc disturbances induced by subtidal flows reside at the open boundaries in barotropic flows these fla obc disturbances distort the barotropic currents in the along boundary direction destroy the hydrodynamics associated with the upwelling circulation and contaminate the baroclinic component and interior solutions that contribute to the discontinuity between sub models this drawback of fla obc is overcome if a consistent adaptation of tst obc in barotropic and baroclinic circulations temperature and salinity occurs when tst obc for all parameters is consistently adapted doing so made the scheme tolerate discrepancies between the l1 and l2 solutions the consistent adaptation in tst obc numerically and dynamically links the circulation between sub models in a quasi seamless manner it should be noted that although tst obc is feasible for limited area numerical applications concurrently driven by extensive and spatiotemporally variable tidal and sub tidal forces tidal currents are imposed along the open boundaries by performing tidal prediction therefore harmonic constants for tidal elevation and currents are an important prerequisite for using tst obc moreover because the subtidal currents are extracted from the daily averaged velocities from its upscale exterior solution the adaptation of the tst obc scheme is limited to one way downscaling applications instead of interactive two way nesting simulations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

23986,understanding ice shelf ocean interaction is fundamental to projecting the antarctic ice sheet response to a warming climate numerical ice shelf ocean models are a powerful tool for simulating this interaction yet are limited by inherent model weaknesses and scarce observations leading to parameterisations that are unverified and unvalidated below ice shelves we explore how different models simulate ice shelf ocean interaction using the 2nd ice shelf ocean model intercomparison project isomip framework vertical discretisation and resolution of the ocean model are shown to have a significant effect on ice shelf basal melt rate through differences in the distribution of meltwater fluxes and the calculation of thermal driving z coordinate models which generally have coarser vertical resolution in ice shelf cavities may simulate higher melt rates compared to terrain following coordinate models this is due to the typically higher resolution of the ice ocean boundary layer region in terrain following models which allows better representation of a thin meltwater layer increased stratification and as a result better insulation of the ice from water below we show that a terrain following model a z level coordinate model and a hybrid approach give similar results when the effective vertical resolution adjacent to the ice shelf base is similar despite each model employing different paradigms for distributing meltwater fluxes and sampling tracers for melting we provide a benchmark for thermodynamic ice shelf ocean interaction with different model vertical coordinates and vertical resolutions and suggest a framework for any future ice shelf ocean thermodynamic parameterisations 1 introduction understanding the magnitude and distribution of basal melting beneath ice shelves is critical to assessing current mass loss from antarctica and projecting the contribution from grounded ice to future sea level rise basal melting is the largest source of mass loss 1516 106 gtyr 1 liu et al 2015 from the antarctic ice sheet and affects the grounded portions of the ice sheet through the reduction of buttressing of tributary glaciers schoof 2007 hence ice loss through basal melting of the floating portions of the ice sheet can lead to glacier acceleration and an increased contribution to sea level uncertainty exists in the magnitude of recent antarctic contribution to global mean sea level rise church et al 2013 with recent estimates of total contribution over the period 1992 2017 being 4 6 1 2 mm shepherd et al 2019 to 7 6 3 9 mm shepherd et al 2018 however projections of antarctic contributions under future warming scenarios contain significantly higher uncertainty due to poorly understood processes that might drive rapid ice discharge e g weertman 1974 deconto and pollard 2016 in order to reduce uncertainty in current contributions and improve projections of future contributions from antarctica we require a better understanding of basal melting numerical models that include the thermodynamic interaction between the ocean and the ice sheet provide the best option for investigating current and future sea level contributions from antarctica for example see roms dinniman et al 2007 mitgcm losch 2008 fesom timmermann et al 2012 him mom6 goldberg et al 2012a coco kusahara and hasumi 2013 fvcom zhou and hattermann 2020 and nemo mathiot et al 2017 these models provide wide spatial coverage and fine temporal resolution fully coupled ocean ice sheet models will allow full investigation of how ocean driven basal melting affects antarctica but are as yet still in their infancy for large realistic domains ice shelf ocean models which neglect ice dynamics and assume a steady state ice geometry are therefore the best current option these models are based on widely used numerical ocean models but with modifications to allow for pressure exerted on the water column from the ice and thermodynamic exchange of heat and freshwater ice shelf ocean models allow this data poor environment to be explored by simulating both small scale processes and the large scale spatial and temporal evolution of antarctic basal melting this is critical to improving estimates of antarctic mass loss furthermore thermodynamic interaction between ice shelves and the ocean can also modify broad scale ocean circulation by freshening affecting antarctic bottom water formation and meridional overturning circulation jacobs and giulivi 2010 and potentially impact ecosystems by affecting the supply of the micronutrient dissolved iron in the euphotic zone arrigo et al 2015 limitations exist in the models however principally in the parameterisations that drive the thermodynamic exchange between seawater and ice thermodynamic interaction is typically parameterised with the three equation parameterisation hellmer and olbers 1989 holland and jenkins 1999 which can be formulated as 1 ρ f w m w l i ρ i c i κ i t i z b ρ s w c s w u γ t t b t m 2 ρ f w m w s b ρ s w u γ s s b s m 3 t b a s b b c p b 4 u 2 c d u m 2 here m w is the melt rate water equivalent u is the friction velocity t b s b and p b are the temperature salinity and pressure at the ice base t m s m and u m are the temperature salinity and velocity at some specified distance from the ice base in this isomip application the heat diffusivity into ice κ i is set to zero insulating ice and the water speed explicitly includes a constant tidal offset u m 2 u m 2 u t i d a l 2 the turbulent exchange coefficients for temperature γ t and salt γ s will be discussed throughout this paper other parameters are constants as defined in jenkins et al 2010 with subscripts f w and s w referring to freshwater and seawater respectively this approach sees widespread use and is the most commonly applied parameterisation see for example dinniman et al 2015 galton fenzi et al 2012 kusahara et al 2017 gwyther et al 2014 the three equation parameterisation divides the interface region into ice ice ocean interface and far field ocean and describes a conservation of heat equation eq 1 and salt equation eq 2 with fluxes across each boundary the linearised freezing point temperature eq 3 a function of in situ salinity and pressure closes the parameterisation and allows the equations to be solved for melt rate as well as the temperature and salinity at the ice ocean interface turbulent processes that mix heat and salt from the ocean below to the ice interface are parameterised as turbulent exchange rates or velocities the description of turbulent exchange is based on empirical evidence sea ice observations e g mcphee et al 1987 mcphee 1992 and laboratory experiments kader and yaglom 1972 evidence from below the ronne filchner ice shelf supports the three equation parameterisation but also suggests that a simplified parameterisation would fit the data equally well jenkins et al 2010 observations of double diffusive staircases beneath george vi ice shelf are an example where the three equation parameterisation has been shown to not accurately solve for melt rate kimura et al 2015 davis and nicholls 2019 showed that the law of the wall assumption inherent in the three equation parameterisation does not hold at weak flow speeds this parameterisation has been applied to many ice ocean models with different vertical configurations typically the parameterisation is applied between the top model cell and the ice and hence the location where the temperature to drive melting is sampled changes as a function of the vertical resolution likewise the depth over which heat and freshwater fluxes from melt are released will change depending on vertical resolution as a result the simulated melt rate is often a direct function of vertical resolution however as will be discussed below the temperature to drive melting can also be computed as an average over a model mixed layer that may include more than one vertical grid cell in which case the simulated melt may be a more complicated function of vertical resolution since the practical implementation of these parameterisations differs across model frameworks the results of ice ocean simulations with different models may respond differently to this vertical resolution dependency turbulence generated by velocity shear in the momentum boundary layer is important for exchanging heat and salt to the base of the ice shelf however the shape that this momentum boundary layer takes is largely unconstrained except for a few sparse observations and recent high resolution modelling efforts see section 4 2 almost all ice ocean models adopt a simple parameterisation of the boundary layer namely that the surface shear stress τ 0 that drives turbulence is a quadratic function of a representative water velocity u τ 0 ρ s w c d u 2 where c d is a dimensionless drag coefficient and ρ s w is the ocean density this quadratic drag parameterisation can be written in terms of the friction velocity u as u 2 c d u 2 while the form of this parameterisation can be used for predicting stress using a variety of representative velocities see soulsby 1983 the drag coefficient will be different for a different representative velocity e g free stream velocity at the edge of the boundary layer depth averaged velocity velocity at a specific depth the location for the sampling of the representative velocity is unclear and may also introduce a resolution dependency for example the free stream velocity should be sampled at the edge of the boundary layer beyond the influence of interface friction but this will change for different roughnesses and for different water velocities in the presence of a strong upslope buoyant plume which modifies the vertical velocity profile e g jenkins 2016 the relevance of the free stream velocity to surface stress is also unclear likewise while a depth averaged velocity across the entire water column may be feasible in shallow shelf seas it is clearly not appropriate for overturning flow within an ice shelf cavity sampling the velocity at a chosen depth which most models currently do is susceptible to vertical resolution dependencies and should likely be acquired within the log layer o 1 m davis and nicholls 2019 requiring both a high vertical resolution at the ice ocean interface and a c d that is a function of distance from the interface almost all ice ocean models including those used here do not currently implement more complex controls on how momentum exchange is calculated such as varying where the representative velocity is sampled due to surface roughness and ambient flows such as buoyant plumes and so we note that this dependency exists but do not investigate it in more detail results presented in this article were obtained using the experimental setup from the second ice shelf ocean model intercomparison project isomip asay davis et al 2016 however this article is neither intended to be a detailed overview of isomip nor a comprehensive overview of the main results from the isomip experiment see asay davis et al 2016 instead this article will explain key differences between a terrain following vertical coordinate model roms a z coordinate model coco and an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian vertical coordinate model mpas o within the isomip framework the effect of vertical resolution on melt rate and the effect of implicitly and explicitly parameterised vertical mixing on ice ocean models will also be investigated in the context of isomip and ice ocean modelling as a whole this article will improve understanding of the differences in simulations that results from different model platforms recommendations will be made for future modelling and observational studies however this study like isomip is not designed to provide the correct answer for how ice ocean interaction occurs and who is simulating this correctly section 2 provides a brief overview of the isomip common resolution and parameter com experiments and models participating in this study section 3 summarises selected isomip results to illustrate the differences between different model configurations while the impact of chosen vertical resolution is demonstrated across different model frameworks in section 4 the dependence on model vertical resolution is linked to vertical mixing processes and the implications for understanding modelling studies and designing future model simulations are discussed 2 experimental setup the marine ice sheet ocean model intercomparison project misomip a climate and cryosphere project targeted activity 1 1 http www climate cryosphere org activities targeted misomip describes a semi idealised fjord like bathymetry with a glacier and ice shelf the intercomparison project will consist of an ice sheet component and an ice shelf ocean component isomip asay davis et al 2016 the aim of misomip is to aid in the validation and development of fully coupled ice sheet ocean models together with their constituent stand alone components isomip follows the precedent established by several previous idealised ice shelf ocean modelling studies grosfeld et al 1997 holland et al 2008 losch 2008 little et al 2008 2009 goldberg et al 2012a b kimura et al 2013 dansereau et al 2014 gwyther et al 2015 2016 and the original isomip hunter 2006 the aim of these experiments is to provide a test case for development of ice shelf ocean model applications explore and better understand ice ocean interaction and compare different modelling frameworks and parameters the specifications for isomip outline five experiments with different initial and boundary forcing conditions as well as in two experiments a time varying ice geometry isomip is chosen as the experimental framework so as to facilitate easier comparison to results from other models in isomip and those developed in the future the first three experiments in isomip ocean0 ocean1 and ocean2 use a steady state ice geometry they are designed to examine the response of basal melting and circulation within the ice shelf cavity to far field ocean forcing the first experiment ocean0 uses warm initial conditions throughout the cavity and continually restores at the northern boundary to the same initial conditions ocean1 is designed to examine the response to a warming ocean and hence is initialised with cold oceanic conditions and has restoring at the northern boundary to warm conditions ocean2 is designed to examine the response to a cooling ocean and hence is initialised with warm oceanic conditions and has restoring to cool conditions at the northern boundary the details for these experiments are covered at length in asay davis et al 2016 in this study the experiment ocean0 is chosen as the base of comparison for the different models this is because the initial and restoring conditions allow for faster model spin up than ocean1 or ocean2 with ocean conditions typically reaching a quasi steady state in one to two years however in section 3 4 we use the same geometry but with cold initial condition and cold restoring conditions to simulate a cold cavity environment with details given in asay davis et al 2016 in isomip interior vertical mixing is similar for each model with constant values of vertical diffusivity and viscosity if the local stratification is unstable vertical diffusivity and viscosity are increased to larger constant values the experimental design excludes more complex parameterisations of vertical mixing for example k profile parameterisation kpp large et al 1994 which includes a non local surface boundary layer and instability from resolved vertical shear unresolved double diffusivity and internal waves in the calculation of interior diffusivity and viscosity vertical mixing at the ice shelf ocean boundary region must be considered separately for the z coordinate models in isomip the vertical resolution may not resolve the ice shelf ocean boundary layer particularly where melting produces a stably stratified and thin boundary layer e g 12m beneath melting sites on pine island glacier stanton et al 2013 this is also true for z coordinate models in realistic applications where computational efficiency does not allow for sufficient vertical resolution to resolve the ice ocean boundary layer as the boundary layer is not resolved a separate parameterisation is generally employed isomip prescribes the boundary layer method similar to that described in losch 2008 this is achieved by distributing meltwater released by basal melting down to a prescribed depth below the ice ocean interface which in losch 2008 was equivalent to one full grid cell but could be set to be several cells below or indeed could be set to be independent of vertical resolution e g mpas o likewise the choice of where to sample the far field temperature is generally at a certain depth below the ice shelf base kimura et al 2013 or as the average down to the mixed layer depth in this comparison coco and mpas o each employ unique boundary layer schemes with mpas o using a modified losch style scheme roms is configured to sample temperature and salinity at the top grid cell generally 1m thick and release meltwater into the top model cell allowing the vertical mixing scheme to parameterise the transport of momentum and tracers downwards more details of the boundary layer mixing schemes for each model are given in table 1 table a 1 and at relevant locations through the text most modern models use transfer rates turbulent exchange velocities for temperature γ t and salinity γ s that vary as a complex function of velocity amongst other parameters following mcphee et al 1987 isomip specifies a velocity dependent formulation where the exchange velocities γ t and γ s are linear functions of the friction velocity u such that γ t s u γ t s where the turbulent heat and salt transfer coefficients for temperature and salt γ t and γ s are assumed to be constant observations of turbulent exchange below sea ice offer support for this assumption mcphee and kottmeier 1999 in the parameter studies that follow we vary the transfer coefficient between experiments to assess the impact of weaker to stronger turbulence 2 1 model descriptions the regional ocean modeling system roms is a 3d numerical ocean model developed for coastal ocean modelling studies shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 it uses a terrain following vertical coordinate configured to provide higher resolution at the ocean surface

model coco is a z coordinate coupled ocean sea ice model developed in partnership between the japan agency for marine earth science and technology and the atmosphere and ocean research institute the university of tokyo like roms coco solves the primitive equation under the boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations and includes a steady state ice shelf component kusahara and hasumi 2013 it has been used for modelling ocean cryosphere interactions over the southern ocean kusahara and hasumi 2013 2014 kusahara et al 2017 in the isomip framework coco used a full step representation for ice shelf draft instead of a partial step treatment adcroft et al 1997 the full step representation was used so that sampling of tracers and momentum is computed in the centre of each cell at a known constant distance from the ice with partial cells this sampling would occur at arbitrary distances depending on the thickness of each partial cell as configured for isomip experiments the vertical resolution was chosen as 20m and temperature and salinity in the uppermost grid cell were used to calculate basal melt rate meltwater fluxes were distributed by complete mixing with original tracer properties down to the prescribed depth in the isomip com configuration this is chosen as 20m equivalent to the vertical resolution in this study we also utilised coco with higher vertical resolution of 2m to examine the dependence of basal melt rate on vertical resolution and thickness of the prescribed mixed layer for fluxes more details on the distribution of meltwater over the prescribed distance are given in the appendix the model for prediction across scales ocean mpas o ringler et al 2013 is a boussinesq finite volume primitive equation ocean model based on a horizontal mesh

campin 2004 in the open ocean while beneath ice shelves it follows the ice draft but not the seafloor where layers are instead dropped as they intersect the bathymetry in a manner similar to z level coordinates similar to losch 2008 in most experiments temperature and salinity for calculating thermal driving are found by averaging over cells within 10m of the ice and melt fluxes heat and freshwater are distributed based on an exponential profile with a decay length scale of 10m unless otherwise stated the mpas o experiments presented in this paper are performed with 120 vertical levels corresponding to 6 m resolution in the open ocean and 2 3 m below the ice shelf in the deeper parts of the cavity the isomip specifications suggest tuning of the turbulent heat transfer coefficient γ t such that the spatial mean melt rates are 30myr 1 as a result the ocean0 results shown here are conducted with γ t roms 0 05 γ t coco 0 025 and γ t mpas o 0 0194 in the remainder of the text values of γ t are assumed to be these values unless otherwise explicitly stated note that in this study we will refer to roms configurations as having high vertical resolution within the ice shelf cavities and z level models as having lower vertical resolution we acknowledge that vertical resolution of either coordinate system can be refined to high or low resolution but typically resolutions are chosen in the aforementioned configuration the benefit of terrain following coordinate models for ice shelf ocean modelling is that they can be easily configured to simulate thin cells near to the ice ocean interface without losing computational efficiency however the remapping of the primitive equations to a sigma coordinate system can produce errors in the horizontal pressure gradient shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 leading to spurious flows near steeper changes in water column thickness such as at the ice front galton fenzi 2009 generally sigma coordinate models employ smoothing to reduce this issue which can remove finer details in bathymetry and ice draft z level models do not suffer from this type of error lower vertical resolution in z level models is chosen to maintain computational efficiency to obtain high resolution at the ice shelf ocean boundary layer thin levels must be chosen from near the surface of the ocean down to at least 2500 m however an issue with z level models is the misrepresentation of vertical mixing near step like topography as a result of a coarse z coordinate which is known to degrade bottom boundary layer plumes ezer and mellor 2004 but could also affect buoyant meltwater plumes the impact of different representations of the meltwater plume and how that affects horizontal properties of the plume on the results presented here is unclear 2 2 resolution dependencies in the ice ocean thermodynamic parameterisation there are multiple vertical resolution dependencies in parameterisations of thermodynamic exchange in ice shelf ocean models all of these dependencies relate to how heat is moved between the ocean and ice and the vertical distance over which this occurs the holland and jenkins 1999 parameterisation assumes an ice ocean boundary layer above an ocean mixed layer the ocean mixed layer is assumed to be well mixed and to have well defined properties such as layer thickness and tracer quantities as found in isopycnal models e g holland and jenkins 2001 subsequent models have generally adapted this original parameterisation to calculate the amount of heat available for melting the thermal driving here we refer to the thermal driving as the difference between the in situ freezing point at the ice ocean interface and the temperature some depth below the ice ocean interface which represents the ambient ocean this thermal driving will also be modified by fresh meltwater feeding back on the freezing point and as such is also implicitly a function of the ambient ocean salinity this has led to problems such as where to sample the temperature and salinity that drive melting in roms these values are sampled in the top ocean cell which may or may not match the original design of the three equation parameterisation depending on how thick the top ocean cell is compared to any ice ocean boundary layer in z coordinate models that employ partial thickness cells a simple boundary layer scheme calculates the thermal driving with the mean temperature over a prescribed distance from the ice losch 2008 this prescribed distance likely does not match the ice ocean boundary layer thickness as a result resolution dependency exists in the method for calculating the thermal driving and the method by which meltwater is released back into the model the calculation of the thermal driving typically involves either sampling of temperature and salinity in the top model cell or averaging across multiple cells meltwater fluxes can likewise be applied into the top model layer or distributed via mixing or fluxes into a prescribed depth we have chosen to refer to the depth over which tracers are sampled or averaged in the calculation of melt rate as the tracer sampling distance tsd while the depth over which meltwater fluxes are mixed or distributed will be referred to as the flux mixing thickness fmt the purpose of the rest of this paper is investigate how the parameterisation choices made for the tracer sampling distance and flux mixing thickness impact melt rate in different model frameworks in table 1 the vertical resolution dependencies for model platforms in this paper are shown with more details given in table a 1 in roms thermal driving is sampled and meltwater fluxes are distributed into the top model layer as a result mixing immediately below the ice ocean interface must be dealt with by the internal vertical mixing scheme in coco meltwater fluxes are distributed over a prescribed depth but thermal driving is sampled in the top layer in mpas o both the averaging of tracers for thermal driving and distribution of meltwater fluxes is over a chosen prescribed depth in reality tracer and momentum boundary layer thickness are a function of ocean and interface properties and thus will vary in space and time it seems unlikely that they can be represented realistically by any fixed value 3 results 3 1 differences in melting the isomip results of roms coco and mpas o are directly compared to highlight similarities and differences a metric for model comparison proposed for isomip from asay davis et al 2016 was the area averaged melt rate where the ice draft the ice ocean interface is deeper than 300m we use this metric throughout the rest of the study focusing on the region below 300m depth with areal extent shown by the black outlines in fig 1 in isomip specifications called for the turbulent heat exchange coefficient γ t to be tuned such that the area averaged melt rate was 30 myr 1 however even for very high γ t roms could not reach an area averaged melt rate of 30 myr 1 melting is lower in roms by a factor of two compared to coco and mpas o fig 1 with approximate steady state melting of 13 5myr 1 for roms 30 9myr 1 for coco and 28 3myr 1 for mpas o the similar spatial patterns and mean magnitude of melt rates between coco and mpas o compare fig 1b and c is unsurprising given that isomip models were purposefully tuned by adjusting γ t to reach a mean melt of 30myr 1 the fact that roms fig 1a displays less than half the mean melting of the other models will be shown to relate to its higher vertical resolution the spatial distribution of thermal driving t t w t f difference between the ambient ocean water temperature see definition for each model in table 1 t w and the in situ pressure freezing point t f at the end of the run shows similar differences fig 2 roms again displays much weaker t across the ice shelf compared to both coco and mpas o a vertical transect at y 40 km through each model shows temperature conditions for the cavity and open ocean area fig 3 the temperature distribution for each cavity is similar the meltwater layer is easily observable in the coco and mpas o results as it is relatively thick see fig 3 insets in roms the meltwater layer adjacent to the ice shelf is thin and cold for example at x 500 km 2 c compared to 1 3 c and 1 8 c for coco and mpas o respectively as we explore in the next section the combination of the fact that roms computes melt based on ocean properties in the cells immediately below the ice and the low vertical mixing prescribed in isomip for the ambient water column lead to lower thermal driving and reduced melting in roms compared to coco or mpas o even after adding additional sources of mixing including tides and a more complex vertical mixing scheme kpp vertical mixing near the ice ocean interface was not strong enough to break down stratification and increase melt rates to match z level models typical configuration experiments in isomip which are not shown here 3 2 roms melt rates as a function of vertical resolution here we show that weaker melting in roms is due to the thickness of the top layer over which thermal driving is calculated and meltwater is distributed by simulating melt rate at different vertical resolutions and across a range of heat transfer coefficients γ t by decreasing the vertical resolution in roms accomplished by reducing the number of vertical layers melting increases the isomip experiments prescribe a low constant rate of vertical mixing under stable stratification κ stab 5 1 0 5 m2 s 2 for temperature and salinity because of this prescription the mixed layer depth is effectively the thickness of the top model grid cell as the average top cell thickness is increased through δ z topav 1 1 m orange line fig 4 2 3m black line and 4 8m yellow line melting increases for any given γ t value above approximately γ t 0 01 melting only weakly varies with increasing γ t but across all γ t melting increases with coarser vertical resolution in roms any mixing from the top cell into the ocean below results from the internal mixing scheme if there is limited mixing of heat from below and lateral advection of heat from upstream the dependence of melt on resolution results from a lower total heat content being available to the base of the ice shelf with a thinner top layer to further explain why roms has lower melt rates we present results where roms vertical mixing parameterisation has been modified to mimic the lower resolution and the boundary layer scheme used in the isomip z level models this modification adjusts vertical tracer diffusivity to a constant high value identical to the unstable convective adjustment diffusivity κ unstab 0 1 m2 s 2 from the ice surface down to a chosen prescribed distance 20m in this case below the ice surface dashed curves in fig 4 below this depth diffusivity returns to the specified background rate κ stab as a result tracer values sampled in the top cell will represent the mean value over the entire tracer sampling distance in practice this is imposing prescribed tracer sampling distances and flux mixing thicknesses of 20m similar to the losch style scheme common in z level models momentum diffusivity is left unmodified while these results provide only qualitatively similar results to isomip z level models they do show how roms simulates melting with lower vertical resolution near the boundary layer while maintaining the same resolution through the rest of the model the modified vertical mixing configuration dashed lines fig 4 displays higher melting than the standard isomip roms configuration solid lines fig 4 with the modified vertical mixing scheme melt rates match the magnitude of melt rates of the predominately z level models in isomip which are tuned to 30myr 1 for γ t 0 06 below melt rates of 8myr 1 or γ t 2 5 1 0 2 melt rates simulated with the default and modified mixing schemes follow the same dependency on γ t this suggests that it is only at higher melt rates above 8myr 1 in this case that lower vertical resolution and the boundary layer scheme of losch 2008 increase vertical heat transport from below into the top relatively thin roms model layer at higher melt rates the meltwater layer is spread out over the entire 20m mixed layer by the modified mixing scheme similar to the thicker prescribed depth in the losch style boundary layer scheme but the higher turbulent transfer rate more effectively delivers this heat to the ice than in the case of low γ t and low melting note also that in the case of the modified mixing experiments where both the flux mixing thickness and tracer sampling distance are set constant but δ z vertical resolution is changed dependency of melting on vertical resolution is reduced as we will also see in section 3 5 lower melt rates in isomip e g as simulated by roms are not as a result of a cooler cavity environment on the whole see section 3 1 rather they result from the parameterisation of vertical mixing processes for the same constant vertical diffusivity deeper mixing of fluxes and tracers will result in the ice ocean interface being exposed to deeper and warmer waters and thus higher melting this is evidenced by the reduction of melt rates shown by coco a z level model if the z levels and the pre defined fmt are made nearly as thin as roms levels see section 3 3 3 3 impact of vertical resolution in other models we utilised coco with two vertical resolutions a 2 m high resolution configuration and the 20 m isomip com configuration in order to examine the dependency of basal melt rate on the vertical resolution thickness of the boundary layer and the turbulent heat transfer rate γ t coco employs a boundary layer scheme that is quite different from a losch style boundary layer scheme in the case of coco tracers for melting are taken from the values in the top model cell meltwater flux is distributed uniformly over a losch style prescribed depth though this depth is not necessarily identical to the vertical resolution and the added meltwater is mixed completely with the original tracer properties the ocean0 experiment with a one year integration is used to assess the dependency of basal melt on vertical resolution as simulated in coco we also performed a series of numerical experiments with the high vertical resolution configuration changing γ t from 0 01 to 0 20 and the thickness of the simplified boundary layer over which meltwater is distributed flux mixing thickness from 2 to 40 m the higher vertical resolution experiments were conducted to examine the dependency of basal melt on the fmt thickness somewhat similar to that conducted with roms in section 3 2 the standard isomip vertical resolution and mixed layer depth used by z level models black curves in fig 5 lead to strong melting that increases with γ t as follows from the three equation parameterisation where melt rate increases for increasing turbulent heat transfer the relationship plateaus at high γ t as increasing turbulence does not increase the maximum rate at which heat is delivered from the ocean interior below the boundary layer comparing the standard isomip configuration of coco to a similar configuration but with tracers sampled at 2m and fluxes distributed over a 20m flux mixing thickness yellow line shows that sampling tracers closer to the ice shelf reduces melt rates cf black and yellow lines fig 5a likewise sampling thermal driving at 2m and distributing fluxes within 2m of the ice shelf 10 the vertical resolution of the isomip configuration leads to much lower melt rates in coco in fig 5b a similar experiment is performed in mpas o where tracer sampling distance and flux mixing thickness are explicitly varied with vertical resolution held fixed at 120 vertical layers 2 3m see section 2 1 the results are similar decreasing the tracer sampling distance reduces melting in fact more so than in coco and additionally decreasing the flux distribution depth further decreases melting the blue line shows an additional experiment that was not possible in coco tracers are sampled over the top 20m but fluxes are distributed in the top 2m leading to an increase in melt rates this increase likely results from a partial decoupling of melt fluxes and ambient tracers where there is little feedback from melting at the ice ocean interface on ambient properties far below given the weak mixing furthermore in the ocean0 experiment the deeper the ambient temperature is sampled for thermal driving the warmer it will be because of the prescribed vertical profile of temperature fig 3 to further explore the dependency on flux mixing thickness we ran a suite of experiments in coco and mpas o with a constant tracer sampling distance 2m but with different imposed flux mixing thicknesses and γ t values as shown in fig 6 in both models a flux mixing thickness thinner than 10m limits melting to a maximum of 30myr 1 even with high γ t values the small γ t regime where increasing the flux mixing thickness has negligible impact on melting is larger for coco γ t 0 03 compared to mpas o γ t 0 01 indicating the impact that different model frameworks have in the simulation of melting however for both models choosing a thinner flux mixing thickness generally will reduce melt rates and likewise for decreasing the turbulent heat transfer γ t as in fig 5 there are qualitative similarities in the response of melting simulated by coco and mpas o to changes in γ t and the fmt but differences in the details are likely due to the different application of boundary layer schemes through decreasing the flux mixing thickness vertical fluxes in the z level model coco and the ale model mpas o are made to resemble that of a terrain following coordinate model at high resolution with a thin mixed layer depth 2m for both increasing the turbulent heat flux γ t was insufficient to transport heat to the ice surface and reach the melt rates 30myr 1 simulated by z level models with coarse resolution for the same experiment these results also show the complex and covariant impact that the flux mixing thickness and tracer sampling distance have in governing melt rates 3 4 resolution dependency in a cold cavity environment the vertical resolution dependency existent in the melt parameterisation is not a function of the magnitude of thermal driving however given that many ice shelves interact with a colder ocean cavity it is important to investigate how strongly the dependency manifests in a variety of different cavity environments cold cavity simulations show that all three model platforms perform similarly in response to different vertical resolution settings fig 7 with an increase in the flux mixing thickness and tracer sampling distance leading to increased melting in roms coco and mpas o again a larger tsd than fmt blue line fig 7c acts to partially decouple the calculation of melting from release of meltwater the main difference from a warm cavity environment is the lower magnitude of melting which is to be expected for a reduced thermal driving also noticeable is a reduced spread in melt rates for different resolutions this suggests that while the impact of vertical resolution dependency is in the same direction for a warm or cold cavity the latter will exhibit a lower sensitivity to model choices this could be expected from other modelling studies where a warmed cavity exhibited disproportionately higher melting e g gwyther et al 2016 in this study we focus on warm cavities as the phenomenon we are studying is most impactful in this regime but it is also important to quantify the effect for cold cavities 3 5 separating the resolution dependent response mpas o employs a modified losch style boundary layer scheme though it differs in details to losch 2008 similar to losch 2008 mpas o samples tracers by averaging over a prescribed depth but the distribution of meltwater fluxes into the prescribed depth is with an exponential profile see details in appendix rather than uniformly as in 42 mpas o is uniquely able to separate out the impact of the flux mixing thickness and tracer sampling distance as both parameters can be prescribed independently while holding the vertical resolution fixed whereas the tracer sampling distance is implicitly linked to the vertical resolution in coco fig 8 shows that in mpas o the dependence of melting on the tracer sampling distance is much stronger than it is on flux mixing thickness fig 6b assuming this strong dependence also holds for z level models like coco this makes it difficult to compute melt fluxes that are independent of vertical resolution given that the tracer sampling distance is constrained by the typically coarse vertical resolution as we discuss in section 4 1 when tracer sampling distances are comparable to or less than flux mixing thicknesses 20m in fig 8 meltwater mixes deep enough to feed back on the thermal driving thereby throttling melting at large tracer sampling distances compared to the flux mixing thickness parameterised melt processes do not mix deep enough to feed back on the thermal driving leading to melt rates that are likely unrealistically large to get a better handle on how melt rates vary with vertical resolution we also performed a series of experiments where we varied the number of vertical layers in mpas o between 36 and 120 with various choices of how the tracer sampling distances and flux mixing thicknesses varied with resolution fig 9 in one experiment the black curve both tsd and fmt were held fixed at 10m in three of the remaining experiments the tracer sampling distance yellow flux mixing thickness blue or both green vary in proportion to the resolution from 10m at 36 layers to 3m at 120 layers in the final experiment both depths cover only the top layer similar to the typical approach in roms the first interesting conclusion from these experiments is that a melt rate with little sensitivity to resolution can be achieved in mpas o with the tracer sampling distance held fixed and the flux mixing thickness either held fixed or varied in proportion to resolution as we will discuss in section 4 1 this solution on its own is not very satisfactory because there are not clear physical grounds for choosing a single spatially constant value for these depths these results are consistent with those from roms shown in fig 4 by default in the ocean0 experiment roms behaviour is similar to the red curve melt rates are small and are further reduced with increasing resolution because both tracer sampling distance and flux mixing thickness cover only the top cell with mixing modified to mimic lower vertical resolution and the losch style boundary layer scheme roms behaves more like the black curve showing melt rates that are nearly independent of resolution z level models like coco tend to follow the green curve as resolution varies the coarse resolution limit for the coco experiments is shown by the black curve in fig 5a while the high resolution limit is shown in orange a major difference is that roms is typically used at resolutions comparable to the right hand side of fig 9 while coco and other z level models typically operate at resolutions even coarser than mpas o on the left hand side 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between dz and melt in section 3 1 we have shown large differences in basal melt rate among the models particularly with coco a z coordinate model and mpas o with its terrain following top coordinate compared to roms with its terrain following coordinate however in fig 3 the broad scale distribution of heat within the cavity is approximately similar the markedly different melt rates displayed by roms compared to coco and mpas o are as a result of cooler conditions confined to the boundary layer region see insets in fig 3 in realistic simulations melt rates can be tuned to match observations meaning that fundamentally different models could simulate the same mean melt rate with different tuning and model set up even in such cases melt rates could evolve quite differently between models in response to changes in ocean forcing or ice shelf geometry as will be explored in analysis of the full set of isomip results this study explored changes in ocean forcing only in a limited way and used only three models so we are not able to make broad claims about how model resolution and other modelling choices might affect sensitivity to ocean forcing nevertheless our results suggest a strong sensitivity of melt rates to the choice of vertical resolution discretisation and boundary layer parameterisation that could reasonably be expected to affect the sensitivity of melt rate to changes in ocean forcing as shown in fig 2 these choices likely also affect the pattern of melting with implications for coupled ice sheet ocean dynamics processes that will be explored in analysis of the misomip1 experiments asay davis et al 2016 one option for tuning models to the same mean melt rate is by varying the turbulent exchange coefficients it seems plausible that models tuned with very different turbulent exchange coefficients to arrive at the same mean melt rate would have significantly different sensitivity to changes in thermal driving and or ocean velocity the basal melt dependence on vertical discretisation results from the treatment of the distribution of meltwater and the calculation of the thermal driving given that these choices are often fixed in the model code it follows that the choice of model framework will have a large impact on simulated melting in the z level models following the isomip com configuration melt fluxes are distributed over a specified and fixed mixed layer depth following losch 2008 equivalent to at least one full vertical grid cell thickness 10 20 m likewise the temperature and salinity used to calculate the basal melting are also averaged over this prescribed depth in a terrain following model the thickness of the layer along the ice shelf base depends on the water column thickness and so the typical thickness for the uppermost cell in the grounding line region is less than a few meters in roms the meltwater is distributed into the thin top layer of the model since basal meltwater is fresh and less dense it stabilises the water column under the ice shelf stable vertical profiles of temperature and salinity reduce the magnitude of basal melting through regulating turbulent upward heat flux to the uppermost grid cell where thermal driving is calculated the distribution of meltwater into the upper water column is the first vertical resolution dependency in both roms and coco in isomip mixing from the ice ocean boundary layer into the ocean below is described by distributing tracer fluxes either into the top layer or over a predefined mixed layer depth heat and freshwater are distributed into the top layer as in roms or are fluxed into the flux mixing thickness 20m for models with a losch style scheme in isomip with a chosen profile e g exponentially decaying as in mpas o or evenly mixed over the flux mixing thickness as in coco roms experiments simulating a lower vertical resolution boundary layer selectively increased mixing rates for heat and meltwater across the top 20m of ocean effectively producing the uniform properties of the top cell in a coarse resolution model the increased vertical diffusivity mixes more heat into the cell closest to the ice shelf reduces stratification from a meltwater layer and drives stronger melting in idealised e g isomip experiments with mitgcm losch 2008 and realistic e g circum antarctic experiments in mitgcm schodlok et al 2016 z level models maximum melt rates have been shown to increase with coarser vertical resolution which is attributed to increased vertical mixing decreased representation of the meltwater layer and more heat closer to the ice shelf losch 2008 schodlok et al 2016 in contrast a terrain following coordinate model that distributes meltwater fluxes into the thin top model layer relies on the ocean vertical mixing parameterisation to mix meltwater downwards from the interface any well mixed layer will be calculated internally by a choice of vertical mixing scheme such as kpp in the isomip roms experiments with constant interior vertical mixing and the absence of other sources of mixing e g tides or increased surface energy input due to stress between the ice shelf base and a rapidly moving buoyant plume meltwater released into the top model layer forms a buoyant insulating layer leading to lower melt rates than in the case of other isomip models despite broadly similar cavity environments the sampling depth of tracers for the calculation of melting is the second vertical resolution dependency the calculation of the thermal driving requires the sampling or averaging of temperature and salinity tracers the location at which these tracers are sampled will impact the thermal driving in a model with a losch style scheme e g most z coordinate models thermal driving is usually calculated based on the average temperature and salinity values down to a prescribed mixed layer depth typically equal to the vertical cell thickness chosen as 20m in isomip in contrast roms calculates thermal driving with the temperature and salinity in the top model layer this produces a dampening of thermal driving due to sampling these tracers in the region where meltwater is also released conversely when fluxes are distributed close to the ice but thermal driving is sampled over a larger depth the feedback between meltwater release and thermal driving becomes partially decoupled in this scenario and with low vertical mixing such as these isomip experiments thermal driving will be increased and melt rates will be higher e g blue curve in fig 5b in a warm cavity the nonlinear relationship between thermal driving and melting as a result of feedback processes like increasing buoyant overturning leads to an exaggerated response to changes in resolution the cold cavity regime is more linear and the melting responds as a weaker function of the length scales introduced into the parameterisation modellers studying warm cavity ice shelves should therefore be particularly aware of the vertical resolution dependency and how it might manifest with each vertical coordinate system in order to represent physical processes on a discrete grid choices must be made about vertical resolution a coarser grid will result in a greater depth being represented by a single tracer value meaning that a coarser resolution is roughly equivalent to a strong vertical mixing over the thickness of the cell if that same thickness was represented by multiple layers in other words implicit mixing or homogenisation of fine scale features within the cell thickness results from the vertical discretisation process a higher vertical resolution and thinner layers will result in less implicit mixing in the context of isomip a high resolution roms simulation with thin vertical layers will represent a thin meltwater layer and warmer water below given the choices of fmt and tsd in roms this will lead to a lower melt rate than if a coarser resolution were used that homogenised the meltwater layers with warmer water below in contrast a z coordinate model with coarser resolution e g 20m vertical cells will homogenise meltwater with water below leading to a higher melt rate models like mpas o that average far field tracers for the ice ocean boundary conditions and distribute fluxes over several vertical layers essentially treat the ice ocean boundary layer as if the model had a coarser resolution leading to melt rates comparable to z level models it does not seem possible to tune roms to reach the specified 30 myr 1 mean melt rate with the forcing conditions and tuning parameters prescribed in isomip without a coarser vertical resolution or implementation of a new boundary layer scheme it is in this sense that the melt rate in roms is lower than in other models however this comparison is given with caution as the correct value for melting is unknown further observations are required to improve understanding of the boundary layer beneath ice shelves under different topographic oceanographic and buoyancy conditions 4 2 towards vertical resolution independent parameterisations limitations in the current treatment of the ice shelf ocean boundary layer that lead to resolution dependency in melt rates are well known dinniman et al 2016 schodlok et al 2016 asay davis et al 2016 while we have demonstrated more thoroughly the reasons and limits of this dependency there remains much uncertainty in how the impact of vertical resolution dependency will manifest in more realistic models of ice shelf ocean interaction given the important role of ice shelf ocean models in forming accurate projections for future sea level rise this major uncertainty must be addressed furthermore as computational power increases there will likely be a move to higher vertical resolution however until the full spectrum of turbulent processes can be explicitly resolved parameterisations of processes in the surface boundary layer will need to evolve with the increasing vertical resolution while this article is not the appropriate forum to introduce a new parameterisation we can indicate future research directions that may lead to improved simulation of the ice shelf ocean boundary layer understanding the structure and mechanisms that govern thermodynamic and momentum exchange at the ice shelf ocean boundary layer are limited by the paucity of observations and the spatial heterogeneity of ice shelf ocean interactions using turbulence velocity and temperature observations beneath larsen c ice shelf davis and nicholls 2019 showed that in weak flow conditions the log layer the inner region where the law of the wall applies is relatively thin 2 5 m thick as a result sampling velocity outside of the log layer such as in models with thick vertical layers o 10 m while still using a quadratic drag parameterisation that employs a c d tuned for sampling within the log layer will lead to a significant difference in the magnitude of the friction velocity and melt rates davis and nicholls 2019 even in models with high vertical resolution the use of constant values of c d e g jenkins et al 2010 is not appropriate when velocities are sampled within the log layer in which c d should depend on the distance from the ice ocean boundary beneath pine island glacier within a channelised region of high basal melting there was an observed mismatch between the altimeter measure of ice retreat and that inferred from salt fluxes stanton et al 2013 this possibly indicates the presence of strong lateral advection moving salt fluxes from upstream but it should also be noted that the nature of turbulent mixing at the ice shelf ocean interface remain unknown and unquantified beneath mcmurdo ice shelf temperature and salinity measurements indicate a complex and varying vertical tracer profile robinson et al 2010 contrary to a mixed layer which provides the ambient properties for calculating thermal driving in the three equation parameterisation beneath ross ice shelf a co located ice penetrating radar site and a mooring allowed a robust assessment of the parameterisation showing that in the situation with a tracer boundary layer which displays a thermal gradient less well mixed the melt rate dependency on temperature as expected from holland and jenkins 1999 degrades stewart 2017 beneath george vi ice shelf observations of diffusive convective thermohaline staircases directly contradict assumptions of a turbulent boundary layer kimura et al 2015 furthermore in complex conditions of supercooling basal freezing and a destabilising buoyancy flux the robustness of current parameterisations is even less well known as suggested in observations e g robinson et al 2014 and modelling studies e g rees jones and wells 2018 likewise basal roughness from microscale scallops e g bushuk et al 2019 to sub grid scale channels affects a stress though the upper ocean to form a momentum boundary layer and impact melting observations of the sub ice shelf surface are limited e g robinson et al 2017 and the impact on melting has not been explored extensively e g gwyther et al 2015 the three equation formulation assumes only vertical fluxes across the boundary layer and into the ice shelf without any net horizontal fluxes however simplified theoretical models by jenkins 2016 show that with a sloping interface and a buoyant plume a steady state in the boundary layer could only be reached if spatial gradients were present in properties such as temperature or horizontal velocity this in turn impacts assumptions of zero net horizontal heat and salt fluxes with further implications for how vertical transport through the boundary layer is parameterised the three equation parameterisation also assumes low stratification and a simple relationship between flow in the boundary layer and stress at the surface quadratic drag law however in reality observations suggest that complex stratification can exist below ice shelves kimura et al 2015 also the optimum choices of u and c d in the quadratic drag parameterisation are unclear in a weak flow regime beneath larsen c ice shelf the friction velocity has been shown not to be related to the flow speed by a constant coefficient davis and nicholls 2019 as the quadratic drag law would predict further it is likely that the constant value for c d used in the misomip experiments and many other ice ocean models is not consistent with the sampling location for velocity at either low or high vertical resolution laboratory experiments show that features present at sub grid scales such as variability in ice slope will impact melting mcconnochie and kerr 2018 but melt rates will depend on whether the ice ocean boundary layer is turbulent or still largely laminar in nature magorrian and wells 2016 gayen et al 2016 one key feature that has been diagnosed in both laboratory experiments and high resolution modelling is that assumptions made about the viscous sublayer present within o 1 mm from the ice in holland and jenkins 1999 may not hold in all cases experimental testing has shown that there is a transition from a convectively controlled sublayer at lower water speeds to a shear controlled sublayer in the case of the former melting is independent of fluid velocity and an empirical relationship is proposed to describe this regime mcconnochie and kerr 2017 high resolution modelling and laboratory studies can help to improve ice shelf ocean models through providing more appropriate parameterisations for the different turbulence regimes the importance of the transition from laminar to a turbulent boundary layer regime has also been shown in high resolution modelling the nearly laminar regime is characterised by lower fluid velocity higher stratification and hence lower melt rates as compared to the turbulent regime where higher turbulence formed through strong velocity shear or buoyant flow along a steeply sloping ice shelf base drives a well mixed boundary layer and higher melting the degree of ice shelf slope basal roughness stratification and velocity shear will control the formation of a turbulently mixed boundary layer and hence whether the three equation parameterisation produces representative results mondal et al 2019 vreugdenhil and taylor 2019 while modified melt rate parameterisations have been suggested for the regime transition from laminar and intermediately turbulent to fully turbulent the application into regional ocean models needs to be more carefully considered this is primarily due to the coupled nature of the problem where ocean conditions drive melting which in turn influences the ocean conditions and the demonstrated sensitivity to model choices such as where to sample tracers for thermal driving and where to release meltwater again high resolution modelling is critical for providing parameterisations independent of vertical resolution that describe heat and salt transfer to the ice interface these parameterisations must include the viscous sublayer and transport across the remainder of the boundary layer under a range of buoyancy conditions stably stratified from melting or unstable convection from refreezing and turbulence conditions including diffusive convective layers laminar flow or fully developed turbulence however it is not enough to just provide new values or even functional forms of vertical heat and salt fluxes γ t and γ s rather a new parameterisation needs to feed into the vertical mixing scheme used in the ocean interior e g kpp by modifying the vertical diffusivities and viscosities in the sub ice shelf boundary layer critically for there to be no vertical resolution dependency there must be a smooth transition between the parameterised unresolved boundary layer diffusivities and those used in the vertical mixing scheme for the resolved portion of the boundary layer 5 conclusions we have demonstrated how the commonly used parameterisation for ice shelf ocean thermodynamic interaction performs under different model frameworks the methods for implementing this parameterisation in particular how the tracers that drive melting are sampled and how meltwater fluxes are distributed vary between different frameworks some models assume a relatively thick e g 20 m mixed layer with a prescribed non varying thickness while others using finer vertical resolution rely on explicit mixing from vertical mixing schemes such as kpp however though the methods for implementing this parameterisation vary between models all either suffer from one of two problems either an implicit dependency between melting and the vertical resolution of the model or an arbitrary constant choice of the flux mixing and tracer sampling distances with no physical basis these results also illustrate that previous modelling studies must be understood in the context of the chosen modelling framework and choices for how the melting parameterisation is implemented i e flux mixing thickness and tracer sampling distance the results above suggest that for a similar ocean environment and vertical turbulence parameterisation roms may produce lower melt rates than a coarser resolution z level or ale model the most realistic result is still unknown as we have such limited observations of the sub ice shelf environment further investigation is required to understand the physics and processes that govern this transfer of heat and salt from the ocean outside the boundary layer into the ice the parameterisations that develop from the improved understanding of this region must better capture the transfer of heat and salt across the unresolved portion of the ice ocean boundary region without a resolution dependency furthermore it must achieve a physically based representation of the vertical heat and salt fluxes in the boundary layer that smoothly match with the fluxes imposed by the sub grid scale vertical mixing scheme in the resolved portion of the upper water column this will be achieved through laboratory experiments and high resolution modelling studies e g large eddy simulations or direct

computed from the velocity magnitude in the top model layer layer thicknesses in mpas o are initialised to maintain a haney number haney 1991 below 5 this is accomplished by thickening layers in regions of steep ice slope notably the calving front but otherwise allowing them to thin as the water column thins unlike roms the bottom coordinate in mpas o does not follow the terrain instead layers are dropped where they fall below the bathymetry in a similar fashion to z level models layer thicknesses are a minimum 1 m and the water column is not allowed to become thinner than three layers therefore 3 m thick layer thicknesses vary with the number of vertical layers in the model as well as with depth and horizontal coordinate to give the reader a flavor for typical values in

23986,understanding ice shelf ocean interaction is fundamental to projecting the antarctic ice sheet response to a warming climate numerical ice shelf ocean models are a powerful tool for simulating this interaction yet are limited by inherent model weaknesses and scarce observations leading to parameterisations that are unverified and unvalidated below ice shelves we explore how different models simulate ice shelf ocean interaction using the 2nd ice shelf ocean model intercomparison project isomip framework vertical discretisation and resolution of the ocean model are shown to have a significant effect on ice shelf basal melt rate through differences in the distribution of meltwater fluxes and the calculation of thermal driving z coordinate models which generally have coarser vertical resolution in ice shelf cavities may simulate higher melt rates compared to terrain following coordinate models this is due to the typically higher resolution of the ice ocean boundary layer region in terrain following models which allows better representation of a thin meltwater layer increased stratification and as a result better insulation of the ice from water below we show that a terrain following model a z level coordinate model and a hybrid approach give similar results when the effective vertical resolution adjacent to the ice shelf base is similar despite each model employing different paradigms for distributing meltwater fluxes and sampling tracers for melting we provide a benchmark for thermodynamic ice shelf ocean interaction with different model vertical coordinates and vertical resolutions and suggest a framework for any future ice shelf ocean thermodynamic parameterisations 1 introduction understanding the magnitude and distribution of basal melting beneath ice shelves is critical to assessing current mass loss from antarctica and projecting the contribution from grounded ice to future sea level rise basal melting is the largest source of mass loss 1516 106 gtyr 1 liu et al 2015 from the antarctic ice sheet and affects the grounded portions of the ice sheet through the reduction of buttressing of tributary glaciers schoof 2007 hence ice loss through basal melting of the floating portions of the ice sheet can lead to glacier acceleration and an increased contribution to sea level uncertainty exists in the magnitude of recent antarctic contribution to global mean sea level rise church et al 2013 with recent estimates of total contribution over the period 1992 2017 being 4 6 1 2 mm shepherd et al 2019 to 7 6 3 9 mm shepherd et al 2018 however projections of antarctic contributions under future warming scenarios contain significantly higher uncertainty due to poorly understood processes that might drive rapid ice discharge e g weertman 1974 deconto and pollard 2016 in order to reduce uncertainty in current contributions and improve projections of future contributions from antarctica we require a better understanding of basal melting numerical models that include the thermodynamic interaction between the ocean and the ice sheet provide the best option for investigating current and future sea level contributions from antarctica for example see roms dinniman et al 2007 mitgcm losch 2008 fesom timmermann et al 2012 him mom6 goldberg et al 2012a coco kusahara and hasumi 2013 fvcom zhou and hattermann 2020 and nemo mathiot et al 2017 these models provide wide spatial coverage and fine temporal resolution fully coupled ocean ice sheet models will allow full investigation of how ocean driven basal melting affects antarctica but are as yet still in their infancy for large realistic domains ice shelf ocean models which neglect ice dynamics and assume a steady state ice geometry are therefore the best current option these models are based on widely used numerical ocean models but with modifications to allow for pressure exerted on the water column from the ice and thermodynamic exchange of heat and freshwater ice shelf ocean models allow this data poor environment to be explored by simulating both small scale processes and the large scale spatial and temporal evolution of antarctic basal melting this is critical to improving estimates of antarctic mass loss furthermore thermodynamic interaction between ice shelves and the ocean can also modify broad scale ocean circulation by freshening affecting antarctic bottom water formation and meridional overturning circulation jacobs and giulivi 2010 and potentially impact ecosystems by affecting the supply of the micronutrient dissolved iron in the euphotic zone arrigo et al 2015 limitations exist in the models however principally in the parameterisations that drive the thermodynamic exchange between seawater and ice thermodynamic interaction is typically parameterised with the three equation parameterisation hellmer and olbers 1989 holland and jenkins 1999 which can be formulated as 1 ρ f w m w l i ρ i c i κ i t i z b ρ s w c s w u γ t t b t m 2 ρ f w m w s b ρ s w u γ s s b s m 3 t b a s b b c p b 4 u 2 c d u m 2 here m w is the melt rate water equivalent u is the friction velocity t b s b and p b are the temperature salinity and pressure at the ice base t m s m and u m are the temperature salinity and velocity at some specified distance from the ice base in this isomip application the heat diffusivity into ice κ i is set to zero insulating ice and the water speed explicitly includes a constant tidal offset u m 2 u m 2 u t i d a l 2 the turbulent exchange coefficients for temperature γ t and salt γ s will be discussed throughout this paper other parameters are constants as defined in jenkins et al 2010 with subscripts f w and s w referring to freshwater and seawater respectively this approach sees widespread use and is the most commonly applied parameterisation see for example dinniman et al 2015 galton fenzi et al 2012 kusahara et al 2017 gwyther et al 2014 the three equation parameterisation divides the interface region into ice ice ocean interface and far field ocean and describes a conservation of heat equation eq 1 and salt equation eq 2 with fluxes across each boundary the linearised freezing point temperature eq 3 a function of in situ salinity and pressure closes the parameterisation and allows the equations to be solved for melt rate as well as the temperature and salinity at the ice ocean interface turbulent processes that mix heat and salt from the ocean below to the ice interface are parameterised as turbulent exchange rates or velocities the description of turbulent exchange is based on empirical evidence sea ice observations e g mcphee et al 1987 mcphee 1992 and laboratory experiments kader and yaglom 1972 evidence from below the ronne filchner ice shelf supports the three equation parameterisation but also suggests that a simplified parameterisation would fit the data equally well jenkins et al 2010 observations of double diffusive staircases beneath george vi ice shelf are an example where the three equation parameterisation has been shown to not accurately solve for melt rate kimura et al 2015 davis and nicholls 2019 showed that the law of the wall assumption inherent in the three equation parameterisation does not hold at weak flow speeds this parameterisation has been applied to many ice ocean models with different vertical configurations typically the parameterisation is applied between the top model cell and the ice and hence the location where the temperature to drive melting is sampled changes as a function of the vertical resolution likewise the depth over which heat and freshwater fluxes from melt are released will change depending on vertical resolution as a result the simulated melt rate is often a direct function of vertical resolution however as will be discussed below the temperature to drive melting can also be computed as an average over a model mixed layer that may include more than one vertical grid cell in which case the simulated melt may be a more complicated function of vertical resolution since the practical implementation of these parameterisations differs across model frameworks the results of ice ocean simulations with different models may respond differently to this vertical resolution dependency turbulence generated by velocity shear in the momentum boundary layer is important for exchanging heat and salt to the base of the ice shelf however the shape that this momentum boundary layer takes is largely unconstrained except for a few sparse observations and recent high resolution modelling efforts see section 4 2 almost all ice ocean models adopt a simple parameterisation of the boundary layer namely that the surface shear stress τ 0 that drives turbulence is a quadratic function of a representative water velocity u τ 0 ρ s w c d u 2 where c d is a dimensionless drag coefficient and ρ s w is the ocean density this quadratic drag parameterisation can be written in terms of the friction velocity u as u 2 c d u 2 while the form of this parameterisation can be used for predicting stress using a variety of representative velocities see soulsby 1983 the drag coefficient will be different for a different representative velocity e g free stream velocity at the edge of the boundary layer depth averaged velocity velocity at a specific depth the location for the sampling of the representative velocity is unclear and may also introduce a resolution dependency for example the free stream velocity should be sampled at the edge of the boundary layer beyond the influence of interface friction but this will change for different roughnesses and for different water velocities in the presence of a strong upslope buoyant plume which modifies the vertical velocity profile e g jenkins 2016 the relevance of the free stream velocity to surface stress is also unclear likewise while a depth averaged velocity across the entire water column may be feasible in shallow shelf seas it is clearly not appropriate for overturning flow within an ice shelf cavity sampling the velocity at a chosen depth which most models currently do is susceptible to vertical resolution dependencies and should likely be acquired within the log layer o 1 m davis and nicholls 2019 requiring both a high vertical resolution at the ice ocean interface and a c d that is a function of distance from the interface almost all ice ocean models including those used here do not currently implement more complex controls on how momentum exchange is calculated such as varying where the representative velocity is sampled due to surface roughness and ambient flows such as buoyant plumes and so we note that this dependency exists but do not investigate it in more detail results presented in this article were obtained using the experimental setup from the second ice shelf ocean model intercomparison project isomip asay davis et al 2016 however this article is neither intended to be a detailed overview of isomip nor a comprehensive overview of the main results from the isomip experiment see asay davis et al 2016 instead this article will explain key differences between a terrain following vertical coordinate model roms a z coordinate model coco and an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian vertical coordinate model mpas o within the isomip framework the effect of vertical resolution on melt rate and the effect of implicitly and explicitly parameterised vertical mixing on ice ocean models will also be investigated in the context of isomip and ice ocean modelling as a whole this article will improve understanding of the differences in simulations that results from different model platforms recommendations will be made for future modelling and observational studies however this study like isomip is not designed to provide the correct answer for how ice ocean interaction occurs and who is simulating this correctly section 2 provides a brief overview of the isomip common resolution and parameter com experiments and models participating in this study section 3 summarises selected isomip results to illustrate the differences between different model configurations while the impact of chosen vertical resolution is demonstrated across different model frameworks in section 4 the dependence on model vertical resolution is linked to vertical mixing processes and the implications for understanding modelling studies and designing future model simulations are discussed 2 experimental setup the marine ice sheet ocean model intercomparison project misomip a climate and cryosphere project targeted activity 1 1 http www climate cryosphere org activities targeted misomip describes a semi idealised fjord like bathymetry with a glacier and ice shelf the intercomparison project will consist of an ice sheet component and an ice shelf ocean component isomip asay davis et al 2016 the aim of misomip is to aid in the validation and development of fully coupled ice sheet ocean models together with their constituent stand alone components isomip follows the precedent established by several previous idealised ice shelf ocean modelling studies grosfeld et al 1997 holland et al 2008 losch 2008 little et al 2008 2009 goldberg et al 2012a b kimura et al 2013 dansereau et al 2014 gwyther et al 2015 2016 and the original isomip hunter 2006 the aim of these experiments is to provide a test case for development of ice shelf ocean model applications explore and better understand ice ocean interaction and compare different modelling frameworks and parameters the specifications for isomip outline five experiments with different initial and boundary forcing conditions as well as in two experiments a time varying ice geometry isomip is chosen as the experimental framework so as to facilitate easier comparison to results from other models in isomip and those developed in the future the first three experiments in isomip ocean0 ocean1 and ocean2 use a steady state ice geometry they are designed to examine the response of basal melting and circulation within the ice shelf cavity to far field ocean forcing the first experiment ocean0 uses warm initial conditions throughout the cavity and continually restores at the northern boundary to the same initial conditions ocean1 is designed to examine the response to a warming ocean and hence is initialised with cold oceanic conditions and has restoring at the northern boundary to warm conditions ocean2 is designed to examine the response to a cooling ocean and hence is initialised with warm oceanic conditions and has restoring to cool conditions at the northern boundary the details for these experiments are covered at length in asay davis et al 2016 in this study the experiment ocean0 is chosen as the base of comparison for the different models this is because the initial and restoring conditions allow for faster model spin up than ocean1 or ocean2 with ocean conditions typically reaching a quasi steady state in one to two years however in section 3 4 we use the same geometry but with cold initial condition and cold restoring conditions to simulate a cold cavity environment with details given in asay davis et al 2016 in isomip interior vertical mixing is similar for each model with constant values of vertical diffusivity and viscosity if the local stratification is unstable vertical diffusivity and viscosity are increased to larger constant values the experimental design excludes more complex parameterisations of vertical mixing for example k profile parameterisation kpp large et al 1994 which includes a non local surface boundary layer and instability from resolved vertical shear unresolved double diffusivity and internal waves in the calculation of interior diffusivity and viscosity vertical mixing at the ice shelf ocean boundary region must be considered separately for the z coordinate models in isomip the vertical resolution may not resolve the ice shelf ocean boundary layer particularly where melting produces a stably stratified and thin boundary layer e g 12m beneath melting sites on pine island glacier stanton et al 2013 this is also true for z coordinate models in realistic applications where computational efficiency does not allow for sufficient vertical resolution to resolve the ice ocean boundary layer as the boundary layer is not resolved a separate parameterisation is generally employed isomip prescribes the boundary layer method similar to that described in losch 2008 this is achieved by distributing meltwater released by basal melting down to a prescribed depth below the ice ocean interface which in losch 2008 was equivalent to one full grid cell but could be set to be several cells below or indeed could be set to be independent of vertical resolution e g mpas o likewise the choice of where to sample the far field temperature is generally at a certain depth below the ice shelf base kimura et al 2013 or as the average down to the mixed layer depth in this comparison coco and mpas o each employ unique boundary layer schemes with mpas o using a modified losch style scheme roms is configured to sample temperature and salinity at the top grid cell generally 1m thick and release meltwater into the top model cell allowing the vertical mixing scheme to parameterise the transport of momentum and tracers downwards more details of the boundary layer mixing schemes for each model are given in table 1 table a 1 and at relevant locations through the text most modern models use transfer rates turbulent exchange velocities for temperature γ t and salinity γ s that vary as a complex function of velocity amongst other parameters following mcphee et al 1987 isomip specifies a velocity dependent formulation where the exchange velocities γ t and γ s are linear functions of the friction velocity u such that γ t s u γ t s where the turbulent heat and salt transfer coefficients for temperature and salt γ t and γ s are assumed to be constant observations of turbulent exchange below sea ice offer support for this assumption mcphee and kottmeier 1999 in the parameter studies that follow we vary the transfer coefficient between experiments to assess the impact of weaker to stronger turbulence 2 1 model descriptions the regional ocean modeling system roms is a 3d numerical ocean model developed for coastal ocean modelling studies shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 it uses a terrain following vertical coordinate configured to provide higher resolution at the ocean surface and at the bathymetry s coordinate to better resolve surface and bottom boundary layers and lower resolution in the mid depths modifications to roms allow for ice shelves following dinniman et al 2007 galton fenzi et al 2012 with ice ocean thermodynamic interaction from the three equation melting freezing parameterisation hellmer and olbers 1989 holland and jenkins 1999 the geometry and chosen vertical scaling coordinate produced top layer cells of thickness 0 5m near the grounding line 3m at mid ice shelf and 5m near the ice front the center for climate system research ocean component model coco is a z coordinate coupled ocean sea ice model developed in partnership between the japan agency for marine earth science and technology and the atmosphere and ocean research institute the university of tokyo like roms coco solves the primitive equation under the boussinesq and hydrostatic approximations and includes a steady state ice shelf component kusahara and hasumi 2013 it has been used for modelling ocean cryosphere interactions over the southern ocean kusahara and hasumi 2013 2014 kusahara et al 2017 in the isomip framework coco used a full step representation for ice shelf draft instead of a partial step treatment adcroft et al 1997 the full step representation was used so that sampling of tracers and momentum is computed in the centre of each cell at a known constant distance from the ice with partial cells this sampling would occur at arbitrary distances depending on the thickness of each partial cell as configured for isomip experiments the vertical resolution was chosen as 20m and temperature and salinity in the uppermost grid cell were used to calculate basal melt rate meltwater fluxes were distributed by complete mixing with original tracer properties down to the prescribed depth in the isomip com configuration this is chosen as 20m equivalent to the vertical resolution in this study we also utilised coco with higher vertical resolution of 2m to examine the dependence of basal melt rate on vertical resolution and thickness of the prescribed mixed layer for fluxes more details on the distribution of meltwater over the prescribed distance are given in the appendix the model for prediction across scales ocean mpas o ringler et al 2013 is a boussinesq finite volume primitive equation ocean model based on a horizontal mesh composed of voronoi tesselation of near regular hexagons and an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale vertical coordinate petersen et al 2014 in the isomip experiments the coordinate is z adcroft and campin 2004 in the open ocean while beneath ice shelves it follows the ice draft but not the seafloor where layers are instead dropped as they intersect the bathymetry in a manner similar to z level coordinates similar to losch 2008 in most experiments temperature and salinity for calculating thermal driving are found by averaging over cells within 10m of the ice and melt fluxes heat and freshwater are distributed based on an exponential profile with a decay length scale of 10m unless otherwise stated the mpas o experiments presented in this paper are performed with 120 vertical levels corresponding to 6 m resolution in the open ocean and 2 3 m below the ice shelf in the deeper parts of the cavity the isomip specifications suggest tuning of the turbulent heat transfer coefficient γ t such that the spatial mean melt rates are 30myr 1 as a result the ocean0 results shown here are conducted with γ t roms 0 05 γ t coco 0 025 and γ t mpas o 0 0194 in the remainder of the text values of γ t are assumed to be these values unless otherwise explicitly stated note that in this study we will refer to roms configurations as having high vertical resolution within the ice shelf cavities and z level models as having lower vertical resolution we acknowledge that vertical resolution of either coordinate system can be refined to high or low resolution but typically resolutions are chosen in the aforementioned configuration the benefit of terrain following coordinate models for ice shelf ocean modelling is that they can be easily configured to simulate thin cells near to the ice ocean interface without losing computational efficiency however the remapping of the primitive equations to a sigma coordinate system can produce errors in the horizontal pressure gradient shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2003 leading to spurious flows near steeper changes in water column thickness such as at the ice front galton fenzi 2009 generally sigma coordinate models employ smoothing to reduce this issue which can remove finer details in bathymetry and ice draft z level models do not suffer from this type of error lower vertical resolution in z level models is chosen to maintain computational efficiency to obtain high resolution at the ice shelf ocean boundary layer thin levels must be chosen from near the surface of the ocean down to at least 2500 m however an issue with z level models is the misrepresentation of vertical mixing near step like topography as a result of a coarse z coordinate which is known to degrade bottom boundary layer plumes ezer and mellor 2004 but could also affect buoyant meltwater plumes the impact of different representations of the meltwater plume and how that affects horizontal properties of the plume on the results presented here is unclear 2 2 resolution dependencies in the ice ocean thermodynamic parameterisation there are multiple vertical resolution dependencies in parameterisations of thermodynamic exchange in ice shelf ocean models all of these dependencies relate to how heat is moved between the ocean and ice and the vertical distance over which this occurs the holland and jenkins 1999 parameterisation assumes an ice ocean boundary layer above an ocean mixed layer the ocean mixed layer is assumed to be well mixed and to have well defined properties such as layer thickness and tracer quantities as found in isopycnal models e g holland and jenkins 2001 subsequent models have generally adapted this original parameterisation to calculate the amount of heat available for melting the thermal driving here we refer to the thermal driving as the difference between the in situ freezing point at the ice ocean interface and the temperature some depth below the ice ocean interface which represents the ambient ocean this thermal driving will also be modified by fresh meltwater feeding back on the freezing point and as such is also implicitly a function of the ambient ocean salinity this has led to problems such as where to sample the temperature and salinity that drive melting in roms these values are sampled in the top ocean cell which may or may not match the original design of the three equation parameterisation depending on how thick the top ocean cell is compared to any ice ocean boundary layer in z coordinate models that employ partial thickness cells a simple boundary layer scheme calculates the thermal driving with the mean temperature over a prescribed distance from the ice losch 2008 this prescribed distance likely does not match the ice ocean boundary layer thickness as a result resolution dependency exists in the method for calculating the thermal driving and the method by which meltwater is released back into the model the calculation of the thermal driving typically involves either sampling of temperature and salinity in the top model cell or averaging across multiple cells meltwater fluxes can likewise be applied into the top model layer or distributed via mixing or fluxes into a prescribed depth we have chosen to refer to the depth over which tracers are sampled or averaged in the calculation of melt rate as the tracer sampling distance tsd while the depth over which meltwater fluxes are mixed or distributed will be referred to as the flux mixing thickness fmt the purpose of the rest of this paper is investigate how the parameterisation choices made for the tracer sampling distance and flux mixing thickness impact melt rate in different model frameworks in table 1 the vertical resolution dependencies for model platforms in this paper are shown with more details given in table a 1 in roms thermal driving is sampled and meltwater fluxes are distributed into the top model layer as a result mixing immediately below the ice ocean interface must be dealt with by the internal vertical mixing scheme in coco meltwater fluxes are distributed over a prescribed depth but thermal driving is sampled in the top layer in mpas o both the averaging of tracers for thermal driving and distribution of meltwater fluxes is over a chosen prescribed depth in reality tracer and momentum boundary layer thickness are a function of ocean and interface properties and thus will vary in space and time it seems unlikely that they can be represented realistically by any fixed value 3 results 3 1 differences in melting the isomip results of roms coco and mpas o are directly compared to highlight similarities and differences a metric for model comparison proposed for isomip from asay davis et al 2016 was the area averaged melt rate where the ice draft the ice ocean interface is deeper than 300m we use this metric throughout the rest of the study focusing on the region below 300m depth with areal extent shown by the black outlines in fig 1 in isomip specifications called for the turbulent heat exchange coefficient γ t to be tuned such that the area averaged melt rate was 30 myr 1 however even for very high γ t roms could not reach an area averaged melt rate of 30 myr 1 melting is lower in roms by a factor of two compared to coco and mpas o fig 1 with approximate steady state melting of 13 5myr 1 for roms 30 9myr 1 for coco and 28 3myr 1 for mpas o the similar spatial patterns and mean magnitude of melt rates between coco and mpas o compare fig 1b and c is unsurprising given that isomip models were purposefully tuned by adjusting γ t to reach a mean melt of 30myr 1 the fact that roms fig 1a displays less than half the mean melting of the other models will be shown to relate to its higher vertical resolution the spatial distribution of thermal driving t t w t f difference between the ambient ocean water temperature see definition for each model in table 1 t w and the in situ pressure freezing point t f at the end of the run shows similar differences fig 2 roms again displays much weaker t across the ice shelf compared to both coco and mpas o a vertical transect at y 40 km through each model shows temperature conditions for the cavity and open ocean area fig 3 the temperature distribution for each cavity is similar the meltwater layer is easily observable in the coco and mpas o results as it is relatively thick see fig 3 insets in roms the meltwater layer adjacent to the ice shelf is thin and cold for example at x 500 km 2 c compared to 1 3 c and 1 8 c for coco and mpas o respectively as we explore in the next section the combination of the fact that roms computes melt based on ocean properties in the cells immediately below the ice and the low vertical mixing prescribed in isomip for the ambient water column lead to lower thermal driving and reduced melting in roms compared to coco or mpas o even after adding additional sources of mixing including tides and a more complex vertical mixing scheme kpp vertical mixing near the ice ocean interface was not strong enough to break down stratification and increase melt rates to match z level models typical configuration experiments in isomip which are not shown here 3 2 roms melt rates as a function of vertical resolution here we show that weaker melting in roms is due to the thickness of the top layer over which thermal driving is calculated and meltwater is distributed by simulating melt rate at different vertical resolutions and across a range of heat transfer coefficients γ t by decreasing the vertical resolution in roms accomplished by reducing the number of vertical layers melting increases the isomip experiments prescribe a low constant rate of vertical mixing under stable stratification κ stab 5 1 0 5 m2 s 2 for temperature and salinity because of this prescription the mixed layer depth is effectively the thickness of the top model grid cell as the average top cell thickness is increased through δ z topav 1 1 m orange line fig 4 2 3m black line and 4 8m yellow line melting increases for any given γ t value above approximately γ t 0 01 melting only weakly varies with increasing γ t but across all γ t melting increases with coarser vertical resolution in roms any mixing from the top cell into the ocean below results from the internal mixing scheme if there is limited mixing of heat from below and lateral advection of heat from upstream the dependence of melt on resolution results from a lower total heat content being available to the base of the ice shelf with a thinner top layer to further explain why roms has lower melt rates we present results where roms vertical mixing parameterisation has been modified to mimic the lower resolution and the boundary layer scheme used in the isomip z level models this modification adjusts vertical tracer diffusivity to a constant high value identical to the unstable convective adjustment diffusivity κ unstab 0 1 m2 s 2 from the ice surface down to a chosen prescribed distance 20m in this case below the ice surface dashed curves in fig 4 below this depth diffusivity returns to the specified background rate κ stab as a result tracer values sampled in the top cell will represent the mean value over the entire tracer sampling distance in practice this is imposing prescribed tracer sampling distances and flux mixing thicknesses of 20m similar to the losch style scheme common in z level models momentum diffusivity is left unmodified while these results provide only qualitatively similar results to isomip z level models they do show how roms simulates melting with lower vertical resolution near the boundary layer while maintaining the same resolution through the rest of the model the modified vertical mixing configuration dashed lines fig 4 displays higher melting than the standard isomip roms configuration solid lines fig 4 with the modified vertical mixing scheme melt rates match the magnitude of melt rates of the predominately z level models in isomip which are tuned to 30myr 1 for γ t 0 06 below melt rates of 8myr 1 or γ t 2 5 1 0 2 melt rates simulated with the default and modified mixing schemes follow the same dependency on γ t this suggests that it is only at higher melt rates above 8myr 1 in this case that lower vertical resolution and the boundary layer scheme of losch 2008 increase vertical heat transport from below into the top relatively thin roms model layer at higher melt rates the meltwater layer is spread out over the entire 20m mixed layer by the modified mixing scheme similar to the thicker prescribed depth in the losch style boundary layer scheme but the higher turbulent transfer rate more effectively delivers this heat to the ice than in the case of low γ t and low melting note also that in the case of the modified mixing experiments where both the flux mixing thickness and tracer sampling distance are set constant but δ z vertical resolution is changed dependency of melting on vertical resolution is reduced as we will also see in section 3 5 lower melt rates in isomip e g as simulated by roms are not as a result of a cooler cavity environment on the whole see section 3 1 rather they result from the parameterisation of vertical mixing processes for the same constant vertical diffusivity deeper mixing of fluxes and tracers will result in the ice ocean interface being exposed to deeper and warmer waters and thus higher melting this is evidenced by the reduction of melt rates shown by coco a z level model if the z levels and the pre defined fmt are made nearly as thin as roms levels see section 3 3 3 3 impact of vertical resolution in other models we utilised coco with two vertical resolutions a 2 m high resolution configuration and the 20 m isomip com configuration in order to examine the dependency of basal melt rate on the vertical resolution thickness of the boundary layer and the turbulent heat transfer rate γ t coco employs a boundary layer scheme that is quite different from a losch style boundary layer scheme in the case of coco tracers for melting are taken from the values in the top model cell meltwater flux is distributed uniformly over a losch style prescribed depth though this depth is not necessarily identical to the vertical resolution and the added meltwater is mixed completely with the original tracer properties the ocean0 experiment with a one year integration is used to assess the dependency of basal melt on vertical resolution as simulated in coco we also performed a series of numerical experiments with the high vertical resolution configuration changing γ t from 0 01 to 0 20 and the thickness of the simplified boundary layer over which meltwater is distributed flux mixing thickness from 2 to 40 m the higher vertical resolution experiments were conducted to examine the dependency of basal melt on the fmt thickness somewhat similar to that conducted with roms in section 3 2 the standard isomip vertical resolution and mixed layer depth used by z level models black curves in fig 5 lead to strong melting that increases with γ t as follows from the three equation parameterisation where melt rate increases for increasing turbulent heat transfer the relationship plateaus at high γ t as increasing turbulence does not increase the maximum rate at which heat is delivered from the ocean interior below the boundary layer comparing the standard isomip configuration of coco to a similar configuration but with tracers sampled at 2m and fluxes distributed over a 20m flux mixing thickness yellow line shows that sampling tracers closer to the ice shelf reduces melt rates cf black and yellow lines fig 5a likewise sampling thermal driving at 2m and distributing fluxes within 2m of the ice shelf 10 the vertical resolution of the isomip configuration leads to much lower melt rates in coco in fig 5b a similar experiment is performed in mpas o where tracer sampling distance and flux mixing thickness are explicitly varied with vertical resolution held fixed at 120 vertical layers 2 3m see section 2 1 the results are similar decreasing the tracer sampling distance reduces melting in fact more so than in coco and additionally decreasing the flux distribution depth further decreases melting the blue line shows an additional experiment that was not possible in coco tracers are sampled over the top 20m but fluxes are distributed in the top 2m leading to an increase in melt rates this increase likely results from a partial decoupling of melt fluxes and ambient tracers where there is little feedback from melting at the ice ocean interface on ambient properties far below given the weak mixing furthermore in the ocean0 experiment the deeper the ambient temperature is sampled for thermal driving the warmer it will be because of the prescribed vertical profile of temperature fig 3 to further explore the dependency on flux mixing thickness we ran a suite of experiments in coco and mpas o with a constant tracer sampling distance 2m but with different imposed flux mixing thicknesses and γ t values as shown in fig 6 in both models a flux mixing thickness thinner than 10m limits melting to a maximum of 30myr 1 even with high γ t values the small γ t regime where increasing the flux mixing thickness has negligible impact on melting is larger for coco γ t 0 03 compared to mpas o γ t 0 01 indicating the impact that different model frameworks have in the simulation of melting however for both models choosing a thinner flux mixing thickness generally will reduce melt rates and likewise for decreasing the turbulent heat transfer γ t as in fig 5 there are qualitative similarities in the response of melting simulated by coco and mpas o to changes in γ t and the fmt but differences in the details are likely due to the different application of boundary layer schemes through decreasing the flux mixing thickness vertical fluxes in the z level model coco and the ale model mpas o are made to resemble that of a terrain following coordinate model at high resolution with a thin mixed layer depth 2m for both increasing the turbulent heat flux γ t was insufficient to transport heat to the ice surface and reach the melt rates 30myr 1 simulated by z level models with coarse resolution for the same experiment these results also show the complex and covariant impact that the flux mixing thickness and tracer sampling distance have in governing melt rates 3 4 resolution dependency in a cold cavity environment the vertical resolution dependency existent in the melt parameterisation is not a function of the magnitude of thermal driving however given that many ice shelves interact with a colder ocean cavity it is important to investigate how strongly the dependency manifests in a variety of different cavity environments cold cavity simulations show that all three model platforms perform similarly in response to different vertical resolution settings fig 7 with an increase in the flux mixing thickness and tracer sampling distance leading to increased melting in roms coco and mpas o again a larger tsd than fmt blue line fig 7c acts to partially decouple the calculation of melting from release of meltwater the main difference from a warm cavity environment is the lower magnitude of melting which is to be expected for a reduced thermal driving also noticeable is a reduced spread in melt rates for different resolutions this suggests that while the impact of vertical resolution dependency is in the same direction for a warm or cold cavity the latter will exhibit a lower sensitivity to model choices this could be expected from other modelling studies where a warmed cavity exhibited disproportionately higher melting e g gwyther et al 2016 in this study we focus on warm cavities as the phenomenon we are studying is most impactful in this regime but it is also important to quantify the effect for cold cavities 3 5 separating the resolution dependent response mpas o employs a modified losch style boundary layer scheme though it differs in details to losch 2008 similar to losch 2008 mpas o samples tracers by averaging over a prescribed depth but the distribution of meltwater fluxes into the prescribed depth is with an exponential profile see details in appendix rather than uniformly as in 42 mpas o is uniquely able to separate out the impact of the flux mixing thickness and tracer sampling distance as both parameters can be prescribed independently while holding the vertical resolution fixed whereas the tracer sampling distance is implicitly linked to the vertical resolution in coco fig 8 shows that in mpas o the dependence of melting on the tracer sampling distance is much stronger than it is on flux mixing thickness fig 6b assuming this strong dependence also holds for z level models like coco this makes it difficult to compute melt fluxes that are independent of vertical resolution given that the tracer sampling distance is constrained by the typically coarse vertical resolution as we discuss in section 4 1 when tracer sampling distances are comparable to or less than flux mixing thicknesses 20m in fig 8 meltwater mixes deep enough to feed back on the thermal driving thereby throttling melting at large tracer sampling distances compared to the flux mixing thickness parameterised melt processes do not mix deep enough to feed back on the thermal driving leading to melt rates that are likely unrealistically large to get a better handle on how melt rates vary with vertical resolution we also performed a series of experiments where we varied the number of vertical layers in mpas o between 36 and 120 with various choices of how the tracer sampling distances and flux mixing thicknesses varied with resolution fig 9 in one experiment the black curve both tsd and fmt were held fixed at 10m in three of the remaining experiments the tracer sampling distance yellow flux mixing thickness blue or both green vary in proportion to the resolution from 10m at 36 layers to 3m at 120 layers in the final experiment both depths cover only the top layer similar to the typical approach in roms the first interesting conclusion from these experiments is that a melt rate with little sensitivity to resolution can be achieved in mpas o with the tracer sampling distance held fixed and the flux mixing thickness either held fixed or varied in proportion to resolution as we will discuss in section 4 1 this solution on its own is not very satisfactory because there are not clear physical grounds for choosing a single spatially constant value for these depths these results are consistent with those from roms shown in fig 4 by default in the ocean0 experiment roms behaviour is similar to the red curve melt rates are small and are further reduced with increasing resolution because both tracer sampling distance and flux mixing thickness cover only the top cell with mixing modified to mimic lower vertical resolution and the losch style boundary layer scheme roms behaves more like the black curve showing melt rates that are nearly independent of resolution z level models like coco tend to follow the green curve as resolution varies the coarse resolution limit for the coco experiments is shown by the black curve in fig 5a while the high resolution limit is shown in orange a major difference is that roms is typically used at resolutions comparable to the right hand side of fig 9 while coco and other z level models typically operate at resolutions even coarser than mpas o on the left hand side 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between dz and melt in section 3 1 we have shown large differences in basal melt rate among the models particularly with coco a z coordinate model and mpas o with its terrain following top coordinate compared to roms with its terrain following coordinate however in fig 3 the broad scale distribution of heat within the cavity is approximately similar the markedly different melt rates displayed by roms compared to coco and mpas o are as a result of cooler conditions confined to the boundary layer region see insets in fig 3 in realistic simulations melt rates can be tuned to match observations meaning that fundamentally different models could simulate the same mean melt rate with different tuning and model set up even in such cases melt rates could evolve quite differently between models in response to changes in ocean forcing or ice shelf geometry as will be explored in analysis of the full set of isomip results this study explored changes in ocean forcing only in a limited way and used only three models so we are not able to make broad claims about how model resolution and other modelling choices might affect sensitivity to ocean forcing nevertheless our results suggest a strong sensitivity of melt rates to the choice of vertical resolution discretisation and boundary layer parameterisation that could reasonably be expected to affect the sensitivity of melt rate to changes in ocean forcing as shown in fig 2 these choices likely also affect the pattern of melting with implications for coupled ice sheet ocean dynamics processes that will be explored in analysis of the misomip1 experiments asay davis et al 2016 one option for tuning models to the same mean melt rate is by varying the turbulent exchange coefficients it seems plausible that models tuned with very different turbulent exchange coefficients to arrive at the same mean melt rate would have significantly different sensitivity to changes in thermal driving and or ocean velocity the basal melt dependence on vertical discretisation results from the treatment of the distribution of meltwater and the calculation of the thermal driving given that these choices are often fixed in the model code it follows that the choice of model framework will have a large impact on simulated melting in the z level models following the isomip com configuration melt fluxes are distributed over a specified and fixed mixed layer depth following losch 2008 equivalent to at least one full vertical grid cell thickness 10 20 m likewise the temperature and salinity used to calculate the basal melting are also averaged over this prescribed depth in a terrain following model the thickness of the layer along the ice shelf base depends on the water column thickness and so the typical thickness for the uppermost cell in the grounding line region is less than a few meters in roms the meltwater is distributed into the thin top layer of the model since basal meltwater is fresh and less dense it stabilises the water column under the ice shelf stable vertical profiles of temperature and salinity reduce the magnitude of basal melting through regulating turbulent upward heat flux to the uppermost grid cell where thermal driving is calculated the distribution of meltwater into the upper water column is the first vertical resolution dependency in both roms and coco in isomip mixing from the ice ocean boundary layer into the ocean below is described by distributing tracer fluxes either into the top layer or over a predefined mixed layer depth heat and freshwater are distributed into the top layer as in roms or are fluxed into the flux mixing thickness 20m for models with a losch style scheme in isomip with a chosen profile e g exponentially decaying as in mpas o or evenly mixed over the flux mixing thickness as in coco roms experiments simulating a lower vertical resolution boundary layer selectively increased mixing rates for heat and meltwater across the top 20m of ocean effectively producing the uniform properties of the top cell in a coarse resolution model the increased vertical diffusivity mixes more heat into the cell closest to the ice shelf reduces stratification from a meltwater layer and drives stronger melting in idealised e g isomip experiments with mitgcm losch 2008 and realistic e g circum antarctic experiments in mitgcm schodlok et al 2016 z level models maximum melt rates have been shown to increase with coarser vertical resolution which is attributed to increased vertical mixing decreased representation of the meltwater layer and more heat closer to the ice shelf losch 2008 schodlok et al 2016 in contrast a terrain following coordinate model that distributes meltwater fluxes into the thin top model layer relies on the ocean vertical mixing parameterisation to mix meltwater downwards from the interface any well mixed layer will be calculated internally by a choice of vertical mixing scheme such as kpp in the isomip roms experiments with constant interior vertical mixing and the absence of other sources of mixing e g tides or increased surface energy input due to stress between the ice shelf base and a rapidly moving buoyant plume meltwater released into the top model layer forms a buoyant insulating layer leading to lower melt rates than in the case of other isomip models despite broadly similar cavity environments the sampling depth of tracers for the calculation of melting is the second vertical resolution dependency the calculation of the thermal driving requires the sampling or averaging of temperature and salinity tracers the location at which these tracers are sampled will impact the thermal driving in a model with a losch style scheme e g most z coordinate models thermal driving is usually calculated based on the average temperature and salinity values down to a prescribed mixed layer depth typically equal to the vertical cell thickness chosen as 20m in isomip in contrast roms calculates thermal driving with the temperature and salinity in the top model layer this produces a dampening of thermal driving due to sampling these tracers in the region where meltwater is also released conversely when fluxes are distributed close to the ice but thermal driving is sampled over a larger depth the feedback between meltwater release and thermal driving becomes partially decoupled in this scenario and with low vertical mixing such as these isomip experiments thermal driving will be increased and melt rates will be higher e g blue curve in fig 5b in a warm cavity the nonlinear relationship between thermal driving and melting as a result of feedback processes like increasing buoyant overturning leads to an exaggerated response to changes in resolution the cold cavity regime is more linear and the melting responds as a weaker function of the length scales introduced into the parameterisation modellers studying warm cavity ice shelves should therefore be particularly aware of the vertical resolution dependency and how it might manifest with each vertical coordinate system in order to represent physical processes on a discrete grid choices must be made about vertical resolution a coarser grid will result in a greater depth being represented by a single tracer value meaning that a coarser resolution is roughly equivalent to a strong vertical mixing over the thickness of the cell if that same thickness was represented by multiple layers in other words implicit mixing or homogenisation of fine scale features within the cell thickness results from the vertical discretisation process a higher vertical resolution and thinner layers will result in less implicit mixing in the context of isomip a high resolution roms simulation with thin vertical layers will represent a thin meltwater layer and warmer water below given the choices of fmt and tsd in roms this will lead to a lower melt rate than if a coarser resolution were used that homogenised the meltwater layers with warmer water below in contrast a z coordinate model with coarser resolution e g 20m vertical cells will homogenise meltwater with water below leading to a higher melt rate models like mpas o that average far field tracers for the ice ocean boundary conditions and distribute fluxes over several vertical layers essentially treat the ice ocean boundary layer as if the model had a coarser resolution leading to melt rates comparable to z level models it does not seem possible to tune roms to reach the specified 30 myr 1 mean melt rate with the forcing conditions and tuning parameters prescribed in isomip without a coarser vertical resolution or implementation of a new boundary layer scheme it is in this sense that the melt rate in roms is lower than in other models however this comparison is given with caution as the correct value for melting is unknown further observations are required to improve understanding of the boundary layer beneath ice shelves under different topographic oceanographic and buoyancy conditions 4 2 towards vertical resolution independent parameterisations limitations in the current treatment of the ice shelf ocean boundary layer that lead to resolution dependency in melt rates are well known dinniman et al 2016 schodlok et al 2016 asay davis et al 2016 while we have demonstrated more thoroughly the reasons and limits of this dependency there remains much uncertainty in how the impact of vertical resolution dependency will manifest in more realistic models of ice shelf ocean interaction given the important role of ice shelf ocean models in forming accurate projections for future sea level rise this major uncertainty must be addressed furthermore as computational power increases there will likely be a move to higher vertical resolution however until the full spectrum of turbulent processes can be explicitly resolved parameterisations of processes in the surface boundary layer will need to evolve with the increasing vertical resolution while this article is not the appropriate forum to introduce a new parameterisation we can indicate future research directions that may lead to improved simulation of the ice shelf ocean boundary layer understanding the structure and mechanisms that govern thermodynamic and momentum exchange at the ice shelf ocean boundary layer are limited by the paucity of observations and the spatial heterogeneity of ice shelf ocean interactions using turbulence velocity and temperature observations beneath larsen c ice shelf davis and nicholls 2019 showed that in weak flow conditions the log layer the inner region where the law of the wall applies is relatively thin 2 5 m thick as a result sampling velocity outside of the log layer such as in models with thick vertical layers o 10 m while still using a quadratic drag parameterisation that employs a c d tuned for sampling within the log layer will lead to a significant difference in the magnitude of the friction velocity and melt rates davis and nicholls 2019 even in models with high vertical resolution the use of constant values of c d e g jenkins et al 2010 is not appropriate when velocities are sampled within the log layer in which c d should depend on the distance from the ice ocean boundary beneath pine island glacier within a channelised region of high basal melting there was an observed mismatch between the altimeter measure of ice retreat and that inferred from salt fluxes stanton et al 2013 this possibly indicates the presence of strong lateral advection moving salt fluxes from upstream but it should also be noted that the nature of turbulent mixing at the ice shelf ocean interface remain unknown and unquantified beneath mcmurdo ice shelf temperature and salinity measurements indicate a complex and varying vertical tracer profile robinson et al 2010 contrary to a mixed layer which provides the ambient properties for calculating thermal driving in the three equation parameterisation beneath ross ice shelf a co located ice penetrating radar site and a mooring allowed a robust assessment of the parameterisation showing that in the situation with a tracer boundary layer which displays a thermal gradient less well mixed the melt rate dependency on temperature as expected from holland and jenkins 1999 degrades stewart 2017 beneath george vi ice shelf observations of diffusive convective thermohaline staircases directly contradict assumptions of a turbulent boundary layer kimura et al 2015 furthermore in complex conditions of supercooling basal freezing and a destabilising buoyancy flux the robustness of current parameterisations is even less well known as suggested in observations e g robinson et al 2014 and modelling studies e g rees jones and wells 2018 likewise basal roughness from microscale scallops e g bushuk et al 2019 to sub grid scale channels affects a stress though the upper ocean to form a momentum boundary layer and impact melting observations of the sub ice shelf surface are limited e g robinson et al 2017 and the impact on melting has not been explored extensively e g gwyther et al 2015 the three equation formulation assumes only vertical fluxes across the boundary layer and into the ice shelf without any net horizontal fluxes however simplified theoretical models by jenkins 2016 show that with a sloping interface and a buoyant plume a steady state in the boundary layer could only be reached if spatial gradients were present in properties such as temperature or horizontal velocity this in turn impacts assumptions of zero net horizontal heat and salt fluxes with further implications for how vertical transport through the boundary layer is parameterised the three equation parameterisation also assumes low stratification and a simple relationship between flow in the boundary layer and stress at the surface quadratic drag law however in reality observations suggest that complex stratification can exist below ice shelves kimura et al 2015 also the optimum choices of u and c d in the quadratic drag parameterisation are unclear in a weak flow regime beneath larsen c ice shelf the friction velocity has been shown not to be related to the flow speed by a constant coefficient davis and nicholls 2019 as the quadratic drag law would predict further it is likely that the constant value for c d used in the misomip experiments and many other ice ocean models is not consistent with the sampling location for velocity at either low or high vertical resolution laboratory experiments show that features present at sub grid scales such as variability in ice slope will impact melting mcconnochie and kerr 2018 but melt rates will depend on whether the ice ocean boundary layer is turbulent or still largely laminar in nature magorrian and wells 2016 gayen et al 2016 one key feature that has been diagnosed in both laboratory experiments and high resolution modelling is that assumptions made about the viscous sublayer present within o 1 mm from the ice in holland and jenkins 1999 may not hold in all cases experimental testing has shown that there is a transition from a convectively controlled sublayer at lower water speeds to a shear controlled sublayer in the case of the former melting is independent of fluid velocity and an empirical relationship is proposed to describe this regime mcconnochie and kerr 2017 high resolution modelling and laboratory studies can help to improve ice shelf ocean models through providing more appropriate parameterisations for the different turbulence regimes the importance of the transition from laminar to a turbulent boundary layer regime has also been shown in high resolution modelling the nearly laminar regime is characterised by lower fluid velocity higher stratification and hence lower melt rates as compared to the turbulent regime where higher turbulence formed through strong velocity shear or buoyant flow along a steeply sloping ice shelf base drives a well mixed boundary layer and higher melting the degree of ice shelf slope basal roughness stratification and velocity shear will control the formation of a turbulently mixed boundary layer and hence whether the three equation parameterisation produces representative results mondal et al 2019 vreugdenhil and taylor 2019 while modified melt rate parameterisations have been suggested for the regime transition from laminar and intermediately turbulent to fully turbulent the application into regional ocean models needs to be more carefully considered this is primarily due to the coupled nature of the problem where ocean conditions drive melting which in turn influences the ocean conditions and the demonstrated sensitivity to model choices such as where to sample tracers for thermal driving and where to release meltwater again high resolution modelling is critical for providing parameterisations independent of vertical resolution that describe heat and salt transfer to the ice interface these parameterisations must include the viscous sublayer and transport across the remainder of the boundary layer under a range of buoyancy conditions stably stratified from melting or unstable convection from refreezing and turbulence conditions including diffusive convective layers laminar flow or fully developed turbulence however it is not enough to just provide new values or even functional forms of vertical heat and salt fluxes γ t and γ s rather a new parameterisation needs to feed into the vertical mixing scheme used in the ocean interior e g kpp by modifying the vertical diffusivities and viscosities in the sub ice shelf boundary layer critically for there to be no vertical resolution dependency there must be a smooth transition between the parameterised unresolved boundary layer diffusivities and those used in the vertical mixing scheme for the resolved portion of the boundary layer 5 conclusions we have demonstrated how the commonly used parameterisation for ice shelf ocean thermodynamic interaction performs under different model frameworks the methods for implementing this parameterisation in particular how the tracers that drive melting are sampled and how meltwater fluxes are distributed vary between different frameworks some models assume a relatively thick e g 20 m mixed layer with a prescribed non varying thickness while others using finer vertical resolution rely on explicit mixing from vertical mixing schemes such as kpp however though the methods for implementing this parameterisation vary between models all either suffer from one of two problems either an implicit dependency between melting and the vertical resolution of the model or an arbitrary constant choice of the flux mixing and tracer sampling distances with no physical basis these results also illustrate that previous modelling studies must be understood in the context of the chosen modelling framework and choices for how the melting parameterisation is implemented i e flux mixing thickness and tracer sampling distance the results above suggest that for a similar ocean environment and vertical turbulence parameterisation roms may produce lower melt rates than a coarser resolution z level or ale model the most realistic result is still unknown as we have such limited observations of the sub ice shelf environment further investigation is required to understand the physics and processes that govern this transfer of heat and salt from the ocean outside the boundary layer into the ice the parameterisations that develop from the improved understanding of this region must better capture the transfer of heat and salt across the unresolved portion of the ice ocean boundary region without a resolution dependency furthermore it must achieve a physically based representation of the vertical heat and salt fluxes in the boundary layer that smoothly match with the fluxes imposed by the sub grid scale vertical mixing scheme in the resolved portion of the upper water column this will be achieved through laboratory experiments and high resolution modelling studies e g large eddy simulations or direct numerical simulations in combination with observations under a variety of basal conditions of the nature of turbulence and the rates of heat and salt transfer in the boundary layer credit authorship

and north south faces respectively and tracers located in the center of each grid cell rho point velocities at rho points are calculated as the average of the velocities at adjacent u v points the momentum boundary condition is a quadratic drag law which computes a friction velocity from the velocity magnitude in the top model layer thermal driving is calculated following eqs 1 4 using temperature and salinity in the top model layer likewise melt water release is captured through a virtual salt flux into the top model layer roms uses a terrain following vertical coordinate where the distribution of layers here has been selected to provide a sigmoidal distribution as a result there is an increased layer density at the top and bottom of each water column beneath the ice shelf typical top layer thickness values are shown in supplementary table a 1 coco coco uses an arakawa b grid and the u and v velocities are defined at the four corners the tracer point is located in the centre of each grid cell velocities at rho points are calculated as the average of the velocities at the adjacent velocity points coco uses the temperature and salinity in the uppermost grid cell to estimate basal melt rate and thus tsd is linked to the vertical resolution after diagnosing the basal melt rate coco distributes the basal meltwater in the form of a tracer tendency e g d t d t to the

table a 1 mpas o mpas o uses an arakawa c grid with normal velocities located on the edges of polygonal cells typically hexagons velocity magnitudes at cell centres are computed based on an area weighted average of the square of the normal velocities on edges in the top model layer the momentum boundary condition at the ice shelf base is a quadratic drag law which uses a friction velocity computed from the velocity magnitude in the top model layer layer thicknesses in mpas o are initialised to maintain a haney number haney 1991 below 5 this is accomplished by thickening layers in regions of steep ice slope notably the calving front but otherwise allowing them to thin as the water column thins unlike roms the bottom coordinate in mpas o does not follow the terrain instead layers are dropped where they fall below the bathymetry in a similar fashion to z level models layer thicknesses are a minimum 1 m and the water column is not allowed to become thinner than three layers therefore 3 m thick layer thicknesses vary with the number of vertical layers in the model as well as with depth and horizontal coordinate to give the reader a flavor for typical values in

23987,rip currents arise from the momentum flux associated with depth induced breaking of incident surface gravity waves on beaches with irregular bottom topography in 3d simulations with an idealized topographic configuration uniform density and a steady incident wave field a striking enhancement of transient surf eddy variability occurs over irregular topography compared to smooth topography especially at nearly normal incident wave angles alternatively with highly oblique incident waves transient shear instability is observed over smooth topography whereas for irregular topography standing rip eddies are generated in the presence of larger scale coastline variations mega rip circulations emerge and they are especially strong for embayments in all cases with significant transient surf eddy activity the eddy induced mean horizontal transport is a non trivial component of the total mean transport and sometimes it is much larger than the gravity wave stokes drift typically the transport by the eddy induced flow partially cancels the eulerian transport by the time and or alongshore averaged currents but not by enough to reverse the residual pattern of total transport keywords rip current surf zone instability topographic effects 1 introduction more than 1 3 of the u s population lives in the coastal regions crossett et al 2013 these areas are important for recreational activities and their popularity is accompanied by beach hazards one of the leading coastal hazards resulting in surf zone fatalities is rip currents national weather service 2016 rip currents are commonly observed as strong and narrow currents moving offshore from the coast and exist generally on beaches with strong surf they are also important for transporting dissolved and suspended materials across the surf zone alongshore currents and sea level set up i e increasing surface height approaching the shore arise from depth induced wave breaking longuet higgins and stewart 1962 and rip currents arise due to either current instability incident wave variability or topographic variations many previous studies concerning rip currents attempt to understand the mechanisms behind their generation and dynamics e g dalyrmple et al 2011 or castelle et al 2016 are literature reviews on mechanisms for rip current generation rip current modeling studies can be divided into two categories modeling studies accompanied with measurements or laboratory experiments e g bruneau et al 2011 haas et al 2003 marchesiello et al 2015 2016 uchiyama et al 2017 idealized modeling studies e g yu and slinn 2003 özkan haller and li 2003 uchiyama et al 2009 weir et al 2011 idealized rip current studies are mostly performed with alongshore uniform bathymetries or with added periodic alongshore oscillations termed rip channels for the offshore flow that forms where the depth is larger rip channel spacing and depth has been shown to play a significant role in the strength of the rip currents and on the instabilities yu and slinn 2003 castelle et al 2014 castelle et al 2014 showed a decrease in surf zone retention with increasing rip spacing the incident wave angle is another important factor that with increasing obliqueness intensifies the alongshore current and suppresses the rip current formation as a result the surf eddies die out and the flow becomes more nearly steady when the incident wave field is steady yu and slinn 2003 weir et al 2011 moreover field and laboratory measurements e g haller et al 2014 macmahan et al 2004 reveal energetic very low frequency vlf motions correlated with the rip channels the relation between the topographic irregularities and rip current instabilities vlf motions is poorly understood and this paper further explores it another perspective on the origins of vlf currents is that they are associated with alongshore and temporal variability of the incident surface wave field feddersen et al 2011 but this mechanism is not explored here most earlier studies were performed using depth averaged 2 d models but in recent years the importance of the three dimensionality in modeling rip current systems started to receive more attention marchesiello et al 2015 also see the companion paper by uchiyama et al 2017 for a detailed analysis of 2 d versus 3 d simulations for the duck experimental site study by uchiyama et al 2017 also shows vigorous surf eddy activity associated with the topographic irregularities this motivates the present more systematic study of this influence on surf eddies here we present results from idealized simulations using the three dimensional 3 d roms wec model uchiyama et al 2010 to explore the role of complex small scale bathymetry in instigating very low frequency vlf currents that are highly turbulent and eddy like in contrast to currents over a smooth alongshore uniform bathymetry further we examine the effects of shoreline bays and headlands on wave driven currents in section 2 we describe the modeling approach and the stochastic perturbation method used to generate different topographies results from numerical simulations with and without complex bathymetry are presented in section 3 in section 4 the role of the coastline shape and its interaction with rip currents are explored summary and discussion of the results are in section 5 2 methods 2 1 the roms wec model a total of 52 cases plus additional sensitivity tests in the appendices are performed using the coupled roms wec model i e the regional oceanic modeling system with wave effects on currents uchiyama et al 2010 lists of the cases are in tables 1 2 and the appendices the model consists of the circulation model roms and a spectrum peak finite depth wave model i e wkb ray theory with a depth and current induced refraction and a depth induced breaking and a bottom drag wave dissipation parameterization the stokes drift is calculated from the wkb wave solution and the current acceleration is parameterized from the wave dissipation rates by surface breaking and by bottom drag the model is fully coupled with surface gravity wave effects on currents wec and current effect on the waves cew based on the conservative asymptotic theory developed by mcwilliams et al 2004 and the non conservative model implementation by uchiyama et al 2010 periodicity is assumed in the alongshore direction at the offshore open boundary we assume no net outflow by the sum of the eulerian current and stokes drift at the western shoreline a wall boundary condition is applied with a minimum depth of 0 1 m and wetting and drying behaviors are excluded in practice bottom drag and depth induced breaking make the waves and currents nearly zero in such shallow water near the shoreline the coriolis force is neglected because the rossby number is very large for littoral currents and surf eddies the water density is uniform for the primary cases in tables 1 2 the only forcing is by incident steady monochromatic waves specified at the offshore boundary with a wave amplitude of a 0 5 m and a peak wave period t p 10 s i e there is no wind forcing no heating and no river inflow the incident wave angle θ is varied among cases additional sensitivity tests are performed varying a while keeping the offshore incident angle θ and wave period t p constant appendix c the depth induced

is an important element of a surf zone model and there is a wide variety of representations used in the literature for our idealized study we choose a particular representation and keep it the same as the topography is varied the nonlinear parameterization of bottom stress proposed by feddersen et al 2000 is used 3 τ b ρ c d 1 16 2 u b u r m s w v 2 1 2 u r m s w v u b where c d is the bottom friction coefficient equal to 0 01 u r m s w v is the root mean square wave orbital velocity and u b u b v b is the bottom current velocity we tested different bottom stress parameterizations found in the literature including linear quadratic logarithmic and one proposed by soulsby 1995 that also includes combined effects of waves and currents the linear and quadratic bottom stress parameterizations generate more instabilities compared to the logarithmic bottom stress parameterization and parameterizations proposed by soulsby 1995 and feddersen et al 2000 we also found that soulsby 1995 suppresses littoral current instabilities much more than 3 does lateral momentum diffusion is included with ν 1 m 2 s 1 but see appendix e all cases are initialized at rest with a flat sea level and no waves inside the domain they are integrated forward in time to a statistical steady state that is then analyzed for the results in sections 3 4 2 2 topographies most idealized rip current studies are carried out with alongshore uniform or periodic topographies where parameters such as incident wave angle and bottom friction coefficient are varied to identify the relevant alongshore flow and rip current generation mechanisms commonly used topographies are alongshore uniform barred topography e g özkan haller and li 2003 uchiyama et al 2009 and barred topography with uniformly spaced channels e g yu and slinn 2003 weir et al 2011 xie 2011 here we make a more complete examination of the role of the more complex alongshore irregularities in the topography in rip currents the first set of simulations listed in table 1 is divided into two main groups smooth and irregular where smooth means alongshore uniform topography and irregular means smooth topography combined with stochastic depth variations as explained below the alongshore averages of the smooth and irregular topographies are the same to illustrate the irregularities we show two simple domains with straight coastlines in the top panels of fig 1 panel a is an irregular planar beach topography i e with a uniform bottom slope in the alongshore average and panel b is the irregular barred topography i e with an isolated bump at an intermediate distance from the shoreline whose smooth counterpart is the same as in the study by özkan haller and li 2003 the size of these domains is 512 m by 768 m with d x d y 4 m horizontal resolution and there are 20 terrain following layers in the vertical direction cases with these topographies are analyzed in section 3 in the second set of simulations in table 2 we explore the influence of the shape of the coastline in generating and interacting with the currents section 4 two different coastline configurations are generated with either a headland or a bay as illustrated in fig 1c d the size of the headland and bay domains is larger to accommodate the range of coastline orientations i e 5000 m by 5000 m with d x d y 10 m grid resolution and 20 terrain following layers irregular topography is composed of an alongshore uniform topography superimposed with random depth perturbations to generate stochastic perturbations the procedure described by evensen 2007 is followed this method generates random depth fields h x y with prescribed characteristics μ 0 is the mean σ 2 p h 2 is the variance and the horizontal covariance function is 4 c h h δ x δ y p h 2 exp δ x 2 p l x 2 δ y 2 p l y 2 where δ x and δ y are spatial separation distances p l x is the spatial scale of the perturbations in the cross shore direction p l y is the spatial scale of the perturbations in the alongshore direction and p h is the perturbation amplitude the size and amplitude of the perturbations p l x p l y p h are to be specified for the present study we have chosen p l x p l y and p h values such that random rip channels are generated at realistic vertical and lateral scales see table 3 for the values used thus the perturbed topographic depth is defined by 5 h x y h 0 x y 1 s 0 h x y where h 0 x y is the smooth topography s 0 is a roughness control parameter s 0 0 1 whose sensitivity is examined in appendix c and h x y is the non dimensional random depth field the sensitivity to particular realizations for h is examined in appendix a the offshore extent of the perturbations is limited on a scale that is slightly larger than the surfzone width x o s d to prevent artificial effects close to the offshore boundary its value for different cases is also listed in table 3 then local smoothing is applied near x x o s d to assure that h is continuous the factor r m a x maximum grid stiffness factor is less than 0 35 for all the perturbed cases also the topography close to the shoreline is kept the same for both smooth and irregular cases this is determined by setting up a distance limit similar to the offshore limit but for a much shorter distance i e the depth is set to minimum depth from shoreline to x 16 m this prevented the occurrence of steep bathymetry close to the shoreline all the runs listed in tables 1 and 2 are carried out with s 0 1 we illustrate the composition of irregular topography using the preceding method in fig 2 panel a is the smooth barred topography h 0 y panel b is a random realization for h x y and panel c is the combined total topography h x y for headland and bay cases we first examined the bathymetry around several headlands and bays found in the nature in our observations the topography around most headlands deepens sharply compared to the beach bathymetries adjacent to it whereas the topography within most bays has a milder slope moreover the study by george 2016 investigated circulation and sediment transport at headlands and by doing so he categorized different headlands in the california coast appendix 1 of that study presents a database of classified headlands the size of the headland perimeter used in the present modeling work is consistent with most the headlands listed in the aforementioned database the bay used in the study is just the symmetric inverse of the headland but as will be explained in section 4 it generates mega rips similar to the one observed around a submarine canyon off la jolla ca near the scripps research pier long and özkan haller 2005 thus we construct smooth topographies h 0 x y of the headland and bay domains accordingly then add the random field h x y and again limit its offshore extent the smooth topography in these cases does not have an offshore bar 3 effects of irregular topography this section analyzes the cases with a straight shoreline and demonstrates the differences between smooth and irregular topographies if the alongshore uniformity of h is broken e g by adding rip channels then offshore directed rip currents will form both steady and transient section 1 to trigger flow instabilities small perturbations i e random noise in the order of 10 5 m s 1 are sometimes added to the velocity field at an early time but after currents have arisen in our irregular bathymetry cases we do not need to add perturbations to the velocity field because the instabilities develop almost from the beginning with all incident wave angles however with increasing θ the instabilities are suppressed we define a surf eddy as a deviation of vorticity from an alongshore average within the nearshore region and eddies can be either time varying transient or steady in time standing note that identification of the eddies was done visually where we consider an eddy as a closed circulation as an illustration of the current field fig 3 shows the instantaneous surface vertical vorticity for smooth and irregular barred cases with alternative wave incident angles θ 0 top panels and θ 40 bottom panels at the end of the simulation at the 12th hour of integration surf eddies do not develop in the smooth case when the waves are normally incident in other words having a smooth alongshore uniform topography does not generate any appreciable currents so there is no possible instability for their generation with irregular topography however currents do develop and become unstable due to their horizontal shear and the resulting surf eddies are nearly isotropic in their horizontal pattern fig 3b if the waves are obliquely incident then an alongshore current arises from the breaking wave acceleration and horizontal shear instabilities ensue fig 3c with irregular topography the surface vertical vorticity is enhanced for obliquely incident waves but the current instability is suppressed the surf eddies are now almost entirely steady in time i e standing eddies rather than transient ones fig 3d the sensitivity test in appendix b shows that with a somewhat lowered bar height transient eddies still occur with irregular topography and large θ albeit still weaker than the standing eddies in that regime 3 1 eddy kinetic energy e k e we quantify surf eddy activity with the time averaged eddy kinetic energy e k e we decompose the fields into time averaged and transient eddy components ϕ ϕ ϕ where an overbar denotes time averaging a prime denotes deviation from the time average a further decomposition of ϕ can be made into an alongshore averaged component ϕ and its standing eddy deviation ϕ s ϕ ϕ where angle brackets denote the alongshore average 1 1 with a variable h the only meaningful alongshore average of a 3d field is one at constant x y the terrain a free surface following coordinate in roms rather than one at constant z that would multiply intersect the bottom thus the total field is 6 ϕ ϕ ϕ s ϕ and ϕ s ϕ is the total eddy component furthermore the time and alongshore averaged variance is 7 ϕ 2 ϕ 2 ϕ s 2 ϕ 2 the first right side term in 7 is the variance of the mean and the second and third terms are the variances of the standing and transient eddies respectively this decomposition is applied to the velocity and then depth integrated and multiplied by 1 2 to calculate mean standing eddy and transient eddy kinetic energies 3 d velocity vectors are u w where u u v is the velocity vector in the horizontal direction and w is the velocity in the vertical direction the total eddy kinetic energy e k e is the sum of the standing and transient components steady rip currents would contribute through the standing e k e fig 4 shows clearly that irregular barred topography is highly energetic even when the waves are normally incident solid black line 2 2 for eke and the shear production terms p in 9 10 we compute 3d fields with time averages then depth integrate using the mean surface height for wave averaged currents η c x y and where indicated take an additional alongshore or area average this procedure overlooks an additional nonlinearity in averages associated with the variable η c η c η c this neglected effect is small in both quantities for normally and slightly oblique waves the transient eddy component makes up about one half of the total e k e this indicates generation of energetic eddies due to the irregularities in the topography as the incident wave angle increases transient eddies start to disappear and standing eddies dominate compare the solid blue line versus solid red line in contrast because there is not a mean current to generate instabilities the e k e is almost zero for smooth topography for normal and near normal incident wave angles dashed black line with increasing incident wave angle the transient eddy component increases due to shear instabilities dashed red line while the standing eddy component is zero apart from finite time sampling error thus we conclude that the dominant e k e components change between alongshore uniform and irregular topographies similar behaviors occur in the planar beach cases fig 5 even though depth induced breaking occurs with the same total wave dissipation hence with the same total current acceleration it is more spatially diffused on a planar beach so the currents are broader and weaker compared to the depth induced breaking with smooth barred topography thus the kinetic energy generated due to depth induced breaking is also much smaller the e k e values for the irregular planar beach topography is similar to the one for irregular barred topography but somewhat weaker notice that the planar smooth topography does not generate shear waves in all these solutions there is an important dependency on the bottom drag both its functional form and the amplitude of its coefficient and thus the drag parameterization is an important element of surf zone modeling we chose not to make this a focus of this paper refer to uchiyama et al 2009 sec 4 to learn more about the bottom drag parameterization dependency 3 2 alongshore averaged current previous studies have shown that the stokes drift u s t tends to cancel the eulerian velocity in the inner shelf fewings et al 2008 however this is not always true resulting in a non zero lagrangian velocity 8 u l u u s t cross shore profiles of the depth and time and alongshore averaged eulerian and lagrangian velocities and stokes drift are in fig 6 these include both irregular solid lines and smooth dashed lines barred topographies the eulerian cross shore velocities u are close to each other for all cases shown with the exception of sb40 and ib40 where θ 40 the maximum angle examined eulerian velocities in the alongshore direction v differ significantly between irregular and smooth cases with θ 10 but then became more similar at highly oblique incident angles in the x far field v decreases somewhat slowly and has an appreciable amplitude for oblique waves this is due to the bottom drag wave dissipation that in turn provides an along wave acceleration of the current at the bottom uchiyama et al 2010 it persists as far offshore as the wave orbital velocity reaches to the bottom we performed sensitivity studies not shown and found that the alongshore current in the offshore region is quite sensitive to the particular functional form of this wave bottom drag parameterization even though the behavior around the surf zone is robust this parameterization gives rise to bottom streaming currents more research is needed on whether its prescriptions are accurate stokes drift in the cross shore direction u s t has the same order of magnitude as the mean eulerian velocity u however the resulting u l is almost as large in the smooth topography cases but smaller than the irregular ones v s t is relatively small though variable among the cases in particular between irregular and smooth topographies so v l v which itself is quite different among the cases although not shown the mean lagrangian cross shore depth integrated transport u l defined in 12 is essentially zero as it should be in an equilibrium state cross shore sections of u l for irregular and smooth barred topographies are in fig 7 the pattern of u l is dominated by the eulerian rip currents in all cases the dominant pattern is a shoreward surface current accompanied by an offshore flow at depth undertow above and just outside the bar this primary overturning circulation is strongest for normal and slightly oblique angles in both smooth and irregular topographies near the bar there is a weak reverse overturning circulation that is stronger with smooth topography and smaller θ in the offshore region the bottom flow is shoreward because of bottom streaming associated with the shoreward waves section 3 2 with a compensating offshore flow above to achieve a zero depth integral 3 3 eddy mean kinetic energy conversion the overall energy cycle for surf currents is a kinetic source from the acceleration due to wave breaking and a sink primarily due to bottom drag although lateral momentum diffusion also contributes there is an exchange with potential energy as well due to the free surface elevation but it is secondary compared to the kinetic energy cycle the mean currents can be unstable and convert mean to eddy kinetic energy and then the eddies can be an important route to total current dissipation to assess the energy conversion from time mean kinetic energy to transient e k e we calculate the horizontal shear production term p m s t whose integrand is the product of eddy reynolds stress and mean horizontal shear 9 p m s t u u u x u v v x v v v y u v u y with a further integration over the depth m 3 s 3 the subscript notation for p in 9 is based on the energy decomposition implied in 7 it is a conversion from the total time averaged flow i e the sum of the alongshore mean m and standing eddy s components to the transient eddy t component a positive sign of p means kinetic energy conversion from the time mean flow to the transient fluctuations i e transient eddy generation a two signed pattern indicates mixed eddy mean energy conversion with an implication of spatial transport connecting the two regions the horizontal average of p determines the net conversion m 5 s 3 table 4 the p m s t term for different cases is shown in fig 8 recall from fig 1 which shows the horizontal view of the domains used that for this particular irregular topographic realization there are three rip channels with varying widths located at around 80 m 200 m and 600 m respectively the largest p m s t conversion coincides with these channels fig 8d at θ 0 as anticipated with rip currents there are regions of mixed sign for p as the incident wave angle increases the magnitude of the p m s t decreases although it remains significant for all θ in contrast with smooth topography p m s t is nearly zero for normal incident waves and it increases with θ p m s t reaches a similar magnitude at θ 40 as in the irregular cases even though its total e k e is less fig 4 this is the expected signature of transient shear instability of the alongshore current it is nearly uniform alongshore in all cases p is mostly confined to the bar region although it does reach inside the bar as well in the case with normal incidence over irregular topography after taking a y average p m s t is positive for almost all x values in all cases this is reflected in the positive area integrated values in the first row of table 4 we can also consider other mean eddy conversions as defined in these alternative shear production terms p m s u s u s u x u s v s v x p m s t u u u s u s u x u v u s v s v x 10 p s t u u u s x u v v s x v v v s y u v u s y whose meanings are evident in their different subscripts the total magnitudes of these various shear production terms are listed in table 4 using the language of horizontal shear instability they indicate the following energy pathways for normal incident waves and smooth topography there is little instability and little e k e for normal incident waves and irregular topography the standing eddies s are unstable and transfer energy to both the alongshore mean flow m and the transient eddies t for oblique waves and smooth topography the instability is from m to t with little exchange with s for oblique waves and irregular topography m is strongly unstable to s and the conversions to t are moderate 3 4 wave energy because of cew the wave field is modulated by interactions with the current as well as with the variable topography previous rip current yu and slinn 2003 and weir et al 2011 show how cew weakens the rip currents and their instability especially for smaller values of θ by comparing with solutions in which cew is neglected here all solutions include cew through full wave current coupling section 2 1 the results discussed below are not shown since the all the cases smooth and irregular barred topography cases exhibit similar behavior we first discuss the alongshore and time averaged sea level and significant wave height crossing the bar the waves begin to break and dissipate and the sea level rises shoreward as wave setup longuet higgins and stewart 1962 there is a modest indication of wave setdown and amplification just offshore of the bar a secondary round of breaking and setup occurs close to the shore at x 1 m depth in a broad view all cases have similar behavior although the irregular topographies induce somewhat greater dissipation and setup next we discuss the wave energy for all the smooth and irregular barred topographies wave energy is calculated from the linear wave theory at leading order in wave steepness the time averaged wave energy for all barred topography cases shows a broad pattern of e w decreasing shoreward from the bar there is also evident modulation of the waves in the irregular topography cases for θ 20 the magnitude of e w is similar for both smooth and irregular cases for θ 20 highest wave energy is seen where the rip channels are located i e in this h realization at 80 m 200 m and 600 m in the alongshore and 120 m in the cross shore direction these are sites of wave amplification and enhanced dissipation partly through the cew associated with the offshore rip currents there 3 5 horizontal transport the lagrangian horizontal volume transport or mass flux when multiplied by ρ 0 in this boussinesq model is defined as 11 u l h η c u u s t d z h u b t u s t u b t is the depth averaged barotropic velocity and u s t is the depth integrated stokes transport uchiyama et al 2010 when time averaged the lagrangian mean transport is 12 u l h u b t h u b t u s t u e u m u s t where the first right side term is the mean eddy induced eulerian transport the second term is the eulerian transport by the mean flow and the last term is the stokes transport the second right side line in 12 is a more compact notation for the terms in the first line notice that the occurrence of surf eddies allows for there to be eddy contributions to eddy induced mean flow the familiar one from surface gravity waves u s t and another from the rectified transport by surf eddies u e in the context of oceanic mesoscale eddy material fluxes the isopycnal layer thickness weighted eddy induced transports are a significant element in general circulation dynamics gent et al 1995 the dynamical processes that generate these different types of eddy induced transport are different of course and as yet there is no clear explanation for this surf eddy manifestation 3 3 it is well known that shallow water gravity waves generate a non zero stokes transport but in our incident wave averaged roms wec model the solutions in our present cases exhibit relatively weak infra gravity wave behavior so here u e 0 is due mainly to surf eddy dynamics following yu and slinn 2003 we examine the transport in the x direction associated with the rip currents as the alongshore average of the positive portion of the depth and time averaged u m u e which is shown in fig 9 4 4 subscript denotes average of the positive portion there are striking differences between the cases first the net rip transport is quite small for all the smooth barred topography cases even though it can be locally large due to transient surf eddies with irregular topography it is much larger but somewhat it decreases with θ especially in comparing normal and oblique incident cases this is consistent with decreasing e k e with θ fig 4 yu and slinn 2003 report a similar pattern in their simulations with uniformly spaced rip channel topography in our cases we generated topographies that are random in the alongshore direction here we see an across shore transport that is much stronger and extends much further than in their simulations this indicates that irregular topography is significant in transporting materials offshore however it should be also noted that the present study does not take into account the type of wave breaking spilling plunging which also impacts the direction of transport of materials in the surf zone the components of mean transport in 12 are shown in fig 10 for irregular barred topography this shows an eddy induced transport directed primarily alongshore in the surf zone with a direction reversing pattern in y for normal incident waves the eddy and mean transport components show some recirculations observe the direction of the transport vectors on the other hand for oblique waves the eddy and mean transport components are aligned along the shore the magnitude of u e is smaller than u m where it is largest in the surf zone its peak value is only 5 10 as large for smooth barred topography not shown u m is very small for normal waves because there is little transient eddy activity and it has a comparable relative size for oblique waves for oblique waves the total transport offshore is southward in the direction of the waves the transport due to the stokes drift is comparable in magnitude to the eddy induced transport in these irregular topography cases with a straight coastline but with a very different spatial pattern n b fig 6 in an additional alongshore average we can further decompose the mean transport by separating standing and transient eddies 13 u l h u b t h s u b t s h u b t u s t u t e u s e u m u s t where the definitions should be evident from the symbols for the same solutions as in fig 9 with irregular topography u t e is again about 4 of u m for normal incident waves while the relative magnitude of u s e is close to 35 for oblique waves u t e and u s e are each about 10 as large as u m within the surf zone inner 100 m in x but smaller farther offshore thus the surf eddy induced mean transports are non trivial in these cases although the primary transport is by the mean currents 4 effects of coastline shape the usual practice in idealized rip current studies is to have a straight coastline and as far as we know most field measurements in the surf have been measured for a similar geometry in this section we examine the influence of a variable shoreline on generating and interacting with rip currents as explained in section 2 the topographies of the headland and bay cases are sloped downward and seaward with superimposed random depth perturbations i e there are no bars in these cases in this section we do not consider alongshore averages because of the inhomogeneity in this direction 4 1 headlands the surface vertical vorticity around the headland for different incident waveangles at the 24th hour of the simulation is illustrated in fig 11 highly energetic small scale surf eddies are generated along the straight sectors of the coastline with normal and nearly normal incident wave angles they persist for all incident angles but weaken and contract shoreward with larger θ the surf eddies on both sides of the headland are suppressed in addition for θ 20 a strong alongshore current develops on the wave exposed side of the headland with strong nearshore negative surface vertical vorticity due to increased bottom drag in shallow water this flow separates at the headland leaving the wave sheltered side relatively inactive not evident from the figures because it is a wave driven current shaped by the irregular domain geometry we refer to it as a mega rip current it extends seaward far beyond the surf zone where the waves break to understand the transport around the headland we again utilize the transport decomposition 12 components of the transport and their sum at different incident wave angles are shown in fig 12 when the waves are normally incident top panels in addition to the local irregular topography standing eddies in the surf zone we see two large circulating patterns in the regions next to the headland right around the headland the transport is negative i e directed towards shore and away from the headlands there is a compensating offshore flow the relative size of u e compared to u m is larger in this headland case than with a straight coastline section 4 i e as large as about 50 based on the maximum in one computational cell locally within the surf zone when the waves are obliquely incident bottom panels the transport is mainly directed along the incident wave direction towards south with an especially strong separating flow at the headland tip in this case the eddy induced flows are positioned differently and are somewhat weaker compared to the mean current transport 4 2 bays fig 13 is an analogous illustration of the surface vertical vorticity around the bay for different incident wave angles at the 24th hour of the simulations along the straight sectors of the coast the behavior of the small surf eddies is quite similar to that for the headland fig 11 a striking feature in these cases is the mega rips extending far offshore around the bay the mega rip pattern is broadly a dipole with inflows at the bay edges and a central outflow the dipole is approximately symmetric with normal incident waves but it is tilted alongshore with oblique waves in the wave direction the offshore directed flow from the bay center is shear unstable and tends to meander around its primary axis similar mega rips were observed around a submarine canyon off la jolla ca near the scripps research pier which is much deeper than our idealized bay 30 40 m long and özkan haller 2005 studied the mega rip generated at this location and reported that rip current generation was very sensitive to the topographic irregularities rather than presence of the canyon we did not repeat our simulation without the h perturbations but based on the results in the previous section we would expect a similar result that irregularness enhances variability here the mega rip interacts with the smaller rip currents for all of the incident wave angles this implies that materials transported by the smaller rip currents would be transported even further offshore through this interaction with the mega rip circulation fig 14 shows the transport around the bay for different incident wave angles the eddy induced flow patterns generated due to the bay are stronger more complicated and extend farther offshore than in the headland cases but again its magnitude relative to the mean current transport is larger than with only a straight coastline fig 12 the transport direction is affected significantly because of the mega rip the mean current and total lagrangian alongshore transports are enhanced by the presence of the bay and are strongest while exiting on the down wave side in the headland and bay cases with relatively larger eddy induced transports compared to straight coastline cases fig 12 the stokes transport is smaller than the eddy induced transport thus variations in coastline shape have an important influence on wave driven currents and surf eddies the variety of shapes in nature is large and here we only show two examples to illustrate the influences 5 summary and discussion in this paper we present results from 52 idealized cases for wave driven surf currents over various topographies and coastline shapes using the roms wec model uchiyama et al 2010 the cases are divided into two case groups where in the first group we investigate topographic control on transient rip currents by introducing irregularities to commonly used alongshore uniform topographies in the second group idealized headland and bay domains with topographic irregularities are examined for their influences on transient rip currents in both groups the role of the incident wave angle is examined while the other incident wave properties are held constant the results from the first group show that if the topography in the alongshore direction has irregular undulations instabilities are triggered even at normally incident wave angles with increasing incident angle shear instabilities dominate over topographic instabilities and the surf eddies transition from being mostly transient to being mostly steady the surf e k e is enhanced by the presence of irregular topography this enhancement is greatest for nearly normal incidence which is the attracting direction for depth induced refraction over shoaling bathymetry the second group cases with idealized headland and bay configurations reveal how the flow field changes when the coastline shape changes the headland acts like an obstruction especially at high incident wave angles and we observe flow separation followed by offshore wake instabilities the bay however acts like a large rip channel generating transient mega rips with large scale recirculating flow patterns that intrude out from the coast several kilometers offshore when the waves are normally incident in flows with significant transient eddies an eddy induced mean transport often occurs and can be large in relation e g to the mean stokes transport it also often provides a fractional opposition to the mean current transport that dominates the total lagrangian transport the eddy induced transport is enhanced by irregular topography just as is the e k e these eddy induced transports are modest fractions of the mean current and total transports in the idealized cases with straight coastline and relatively small scale topographic irregularities and they are relatively stronger with coastline shape variations nevertheless they do demonstrate the potential importance of surf turbulence in providing a lagrangian mean advective material transport as well as the more familiar behaviors of eddy induced dispersion and dilution of material concentrations the results of this study demonstrate that topographic and coastline variations are significant influences on surf eddy activity thus for realistic surf behaviors it is important to use either measured bathymetry if available or at least include a plausible degree of irregularity and coastline variation in the simulation beyond the steady wave forcing considered here both incident wave variability and other forms of shelf current variability are also necessary ingredients for realistic surf eddy simulations finally it should be noted that the currents in the surf zone can also further be influenced by tidal forces large oceanic scale thermohaline differences and river discharges moreover truly irregular wave fields with special dynamics e k e surface vertical vorticity velocity fields induced by realistic random wave trains could be achieved only by coupling roms with proper wave models 3rd generation or boussinesq

procedure explained in section 2 2 and generate two more random realizations of the topographic perturbations h x y which then are superimposed on the alongshore uniform barred topography fig a 1 time histories of the instantaneous eddy kinetic energy i e e k e t calculated using the eddy velocity u u are shown in fig a 2 for these three realizations v1 is the control case sb0 and v2 and v3 are two other random realizations otherwise all parameters for the three cases are the same notice that v4 is not included in fig a 2 and will be discussed in appendix b the e k e t varies over a 50 range but the different cases curves overlap substantially with each other and have a similar time average this implies that repeating the simulations given in table 1 with different realizations would yield in similar statistical results because the size and location of the rip channels are different in each case the detailed pattern of the rip currents would be different but the results leading to our conclusions would be essentially similar appendix b sensitivity to bar height we examine the time series of e k e components standing and transient for different barred topography realizations we use four cases where when alongshore averaging applied the height of the bar in v1 v2 and v3 is the same whereas the bar top is deepened in v4 the components of the e k e and its total decline when the bar top is deepened however the transient e k e component is noticeably larger for large θ with the deepened bar and relatively weak transient eddies are observed at large incident angle appendix c sensitivity to roughness factor s 0 here we vary s 0 between 1 and 0 where 1 yields the full perturbation amplitude in 5 to assess how the topographic irregularness amplitude controls the surf eddy activity as expected and consistent with the results in uchiyama et al 2017 smaller perturbation size led to lower e k e and therefore less energetic flow field with less instabilities appendix d sensitivity to wave amplitude a now we vary the offshore wave amplitude a and plot the resulting e k e values fig d 1 for small a the rate of increase in e k e is large but there is a saturation effect for larger a i e increased incident wave energy hence increased wave dissipation and current acceleration lead to increased current dissipation such that e k e does not increase further appendix e sensitivity to horizontal viscosity ν as a final sensitivity test we compared solutions with irregular barred topography and a straight coastline using the standard lateral momentum eddy viscosity of ν 1 m 2 s 1 and the alternative value of zero in both cases the third order upstream horizontal advection provides an implicit hyper diffusion that adapts to both the grid and the flow in extensive experience with roms this implicit diffusion is often sufficient to maintain smoothness on the grid scale shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 results are shown in fig e 1 as expected the explicit ν 0 is unnecessary for stability and the e k e is enhanced without it the enhancement is more substantial for normal incident waves than oblique waves because the ensuing surf turbulence in the former case has a wider range of scales and a more active kinetic energy cascade fig 3 thus our conclusion about topographic enhancement of surf eddy activity would be even stronger with smaller ν bennis et al 2011 reported that cew will be diminished for ν values greater than 2 5 m2 s 1 and the ν value used in the present study is 2 5 times smaller than this limit appendix f eddy mean induced transport mean stokes drift comparison with varying wave amplitude finally we examined the effect of wave amplitude on eddy mean induced transport and mean stokes drift which is shown in fig f 1 eddy mean induced transport is highest onshore after the bar for all cases as expected eddy mean transport shows an increasing trend with increasing wave amplitude with the exception for a 0 25 and a 0 5 u e with a 0 5 is much smaller than the u e with a 0 25 for x 150 m for a 0 75 the peak values of u e are indistinguishable whereas mean stokes drift keeps increasing with increasing wave amplitude 
23987,rip currents arise from the momentum flux associated with depth induced breaking of incident surface gravity waves on beaches with irregular bottom topography in 3d simulations with an idealized topographic configuration uniform density and a steady incident wave field a striking enhancement of transient surf eddy variability occurs over irregular topography compared to smooth topography especially at nearly normal incident wave angles alternatively with highly oblique incident waves transient shear instability is observed over smooth topography whereas for irregular topography standing rip eddies are generated in the presence of larger scale coastline variations mega rip circulations emerge and they are especially strong for embayments in all cases with significant transient surf eddy activity the eddy induced mean horizontal transport is a non trivial component of the total mean transport and sometimes it is much larger than the gravity wave stokes drift typically the transport by the eddy induced flow partially cancels the eulerian transport by the time and or alongshore averaged currents but not by enough to reverse the residual pattern of total transport keywords rip current surf zone instability topographic effects 1 introduction more than 1 3 of the u s population lives in the coastal regions crossett et al 2013 these areas are important for recreational activities and their popularity is accompanied by beach hazards one of the leading coastal hazards resulting in surf zone fatalities is rip currents national weather service 2016 rip currents are commonly observed as strong and narrow currents moving offshore from the coast and exist generally on beaches with strong surf they are also important for transporting dissolved and suspended materials across the surf zone alongshore currents and sea level set up i e increasing surface height approaching the shore arise from depth induced wave breaking longuet higgins and stewart 1962 and rip currents arise due to either current instability incident wave variability or topographic variations many previous studies concerning rip currents attempt to understand the mechanisms behind their generation and dynamics e g dalyrmple et al 2011 or castelle et al 2016 are literature reviews on mechanisms for rip current generation rip current modeling studies can be divided into two categories modeling studies accompanied with measurements or laboratory experiments e g bruneau et al 2011 haas et al 2003 marchesiello et al 2015 2016 uchiyama et al 2017 idealized modeling studies e g yu and slinn 2003 özkan haller and li 2003 uchiyama et al 2009 weir et al 2011 idealized rip current studies are mostly performed with alongshore uniform bathymetries or with added periodic alongshore oscillations termed rip channels for the offshore flow that forms where the depth is larger rip channel spacing and depth has been shown to play a significant role in the strength of the rip currents and on the instabilities yu and slinn 2003 castelle et al 2014 castelle et al 2014 showed a decrease in surf zone retention with increasing rip spacing the incident wave angle is another important factor that with increasing obliqueness intensifies the alongshore current and suppresses the rip current formation as a result the surf eddies die out and the flow becomes more nearly steady when the incident wave field is steady yu and slinn 2003 weir et al 2011 moreover field and laboratory measurements e g haller et al 2014 macmahan et al 2004 reveal energetic very low frequency vlf motions correlated with the rip channels the relation between the topographic irregularities and rip current instabilities vlf motions is poorly understood and this paper further explores it another perspective on the origins of vlf currents is that they are associated with alongshore and temporal variability of the incident surface wave field feddersen et al 2011 but this mechanism is not explored here most earlier studies were performed using depth averaged 2 d models but in recent years the importance of the three dimensionality in modeling rip current systems started to receive more attention marchesiello et al 2015 also see the companion paper by uchiyama et al 2017 for a detailed analysis of 2 d versus 3 d simulations for the duck experimental site study by uchiyama et al 2017 also shows vigorous surf eddy activity associated with the topographic irregularities this motivates the present more systematic study of this influence on surf eddies here we present results from idealized simulations using the three dimensional 3 d roms wec model uchiyama et al 2010 to explore the role of complex small scale bathymetry in instigating very low frequency vlf currents that are highly turbulent and eddy like in contrast to currents over a smooth alongshore uniform bathymetry further we examine the effects of shoreline bays and headlands on wave driven currents in section 2 we describe the modeling approach and the stochastic perturbation method used to generate different topographies results from numerical simulations with and without complex bathymetry are presented in section 3 in section 4 the role of the coastline shape and its interaction with rip currents are explored summary and discussion of the results are in section 5 2 methods 2 1 the roms wec model a total of 52 cases plus additional sensitivity tests in the appendices are performed using the coupled roms wec model i e the regional oceanic modeling system with wave effects on currents uchiyama et al 2010 lists of the cases are in tables 1 2 and the appendices the model consists of the circulation model roms and a spectrum peak finite depth wave model i e wkb ray theory with a depth and current induced refraction and a depth induced breaking and a bottom drag wave dissipation parameterization the stokes drift is calculated from the wkb wave solution and the current acceleration is parameterized from the wave dissipation rates by surface breaking and by bottom drag the model is fully coupled with surface gravity wave effects on currents wec and current effect on the waves cew based on the conservative asymptotic theory developed by mcwilliams et al 2004 and the non conservative model implementation by uchiyama et al 2010 periodicity is assumed in the alongshore direction at the offshore open boundary we assume no net outflow by the sum of the eulerian current and stokes drift at the western shoreline a wall boundary condition is applied with a minimum depth of 0 1 m and wetting and drying behaviors are excluded in practice bottom drag and depth induced breaking make the waves and currents nearly zero in such shallow water near the shoreline the coriolis force is neglected because the rossby number is very large for littoral currents and surf eddies the water density is uniform for the primary cases in tables 1 2 the only forcing is by incident steady monochromatic waves specified at the offshore boundary with a wave amplitude of a 0 5 m and a peak wave period t p 10 s i e there is no wind forcing no heating and no river inflow the incident wave angle θ is varied among cases additional sensitivity tests are performed varying a while keeping the offshore incident angle θ and wave period t p constant appendix c the depth induced wave breaking parameterization proposed by thornton and guza 1983 is used 1 ϵ b 3 π 16 ρ g f p β 3 h rms 5 γ 2 h 3 1 1 h r m s γ h 2 5 2 1 h h η c is the local water column thickness where h is the still water depth and η c η η ˆ is the wave averaged surface elevation that is the sum of the dynamic sea level and the quasi static response due to the conservative wave effects on the currents wec uchiyama et al 2010 g is gravitational acceleration ρ is the oceanic density γ is the maximum ratio of wave height to water depth f p is the peak frequency of the narrow band wave energy spectrum β is a factor representative of the level of energy dissipation and h rms h 2 is the root mean square wave height previous studies show that different wave breaking parameterizations can give different results and they are sensitive to changes in the significant wave height h s in realistic applications the parameters γ and β are tuned in to fit the observations in our idealized cases we use a universal form of γ as proposed by apotsos et al 2008 while choosing β 1 2 γ a b tanh c h o where h o is the offshore wave height a 0 18 b 0 40 and c 0 90 for the parameterization 1 the bottom stress is an important element of a surf zone model and there is a wide variety of representations used in the literature for our idealized study we choose a particular representation and keep it the same as the topography is varied the nonlinear parameterization of bottom stress proposed by feddersen et al 2000 is used 3 τ b ρ c d 1 16 2 u b u r m s w v 2 1 2 u r m s w v u b where c d is the bottom friction coefficient equal to 0 01 u r m s w v is the root mean square wave orbital velocity and u b u b v b is the bottom current velocity we tested different bottom stress parameterizations found in the literature including linear quadratic logarithmic and one proposed by soulsby 1995 that also includes combined effects of waves and currents the linear and quadratic bottom stress parameterizations generate more instabilities compared to the logarithmic bottom stress parameterization and parameterizations proposed by soulsby 1995 and feddersen et al 2000 we also found that soulsby 1995 suppresses littoral current instabilities much more than 3 does lateral momentum diffusion is included with ν 1 m 2 s 1 but see appendix e all cases are initialized at rest with a flat sea level and no waves inside the domain they are integrated forward in time to a statistical steady state that is then analyzed for the results in sections 3 4 2 2 topographies most idealized rip current studies are carried out with alongshore uniform or periodic topographies where parameters such as incident wave angle and bottom friction coefficient are varied to identify the relevant alongshore flow and rip current generation mechanisms commonly used topographies are alongshore uniform barred topography e g özkan haller and li 2003 uchiyama et al 2009 and barred topography with uniformly spaced channels e g yu and slinn 2003 weir et al 2011 xie 2011 here we make a more complete examination of the role of the more complex alongshore irregularities in the topography in rip currents the first set of simulations listed in table 1 is divided into two main groups smooth and irregular where smooth means alongshore uniform topography and irregular means smooth topography combined with stochastic depth variations as explained below the alongshore averages of the smooth and irregular topographies are the same to illustrate the irregularities we show two simple domains with straight coastlines in the top panels of fig 1 panel a is an irregular planar beach topography i e with a uniform bottom slope in the alongshore average and panel b is the irregular barred topography i e with an isolated bump at an intermediate distance from the shoreline whose smooth counterpart is the same as in the study by özkan haller and li 2003 the size of these domains is 512 m by 768 m with d x d y 4 m horizontal resolution and there are 20 terrain following layers in the vertical direction cases with these topographies are analyzed in section 3 in the second set of simulations in table 2 we explore the influence of the shape of the coastline in generating and interacting with the currents section 4 two different coastline configurations are generated with either a headland or a bay as illustrated in fig 1c d the size of the headland and bay domains is larger to accommodate the range of coastline orientations i e 5000 m by 5000 m with d x d y 10 m grid resolution and 20 terrain following layers irregular topography is composed of an alongshore uniform topography superimposed with random depth perturbations to generate stochastic perturbations the procedure described by evensen 2007 is followed this method generates random depth fields h x y with prescribed characteristics μ 0 is the mean σ 2 p h 2 is the variance and the horizontal covariance function is 4 c h h δ x δ y p h 2 exp δ x 2 p l x 2 δ y 2 p l y 2 where δ x and δ y are spatial separation distances p l x is the spatial scale of the perturbations in the cross shore direction p l y is the spatial scale of the perturbations in the alongshore direction and p h is the perturbation amplitude the size and amplitude of the perturbations p l x p l y p h are to be specified for the present study we have chosen p l x p l y and p h values such that random rip channels are generated at realistic vertical and lateral scales see table 3 for the values used thus the perturbed topographic depth is defined by 5 h x y h 0 x y 1 s 0 h x y where h 0 x y is the smooth topography s 0 is a roughness control parameter s 0 0 1 whose sensitivity is examined in appendix c and h x y is the non dimensional random depth field the sensitivity to particular realizations for h is examined in appendix a the offshore extent of the perturbations is limited on a scale that is slightly larger than the surfzone width x o s d to prevent artificial effects close to the offshore boundary its value for different cases is also listed in table 3 then local smoothing is applied near x x o s d to assure that h is continuous the factor r m a x maximum grid stiffness factor is less than 0 35 for all the perturbed cases also the topography close to the shoreline is kept the same for both smooth and irregular cases this is determined by setting up a distance limit similar to the offshore limit but for a much shorter distance i e the depth is set to minimum depth from shoreline to x 16 m this prevented the occurrence of steep bathymetry close to the shoreline all the runs listed in tables 1 and 2 are carried out with s 0 1 we illustrate the composition of irregular topography using the preceding method in fig 2 panel a is the smooth barred topography h 0 y panel b is a random realization for h x y and panel c is the combined total topography h x y for headland and bay cases we first examined the bathymetry around several headlands and bays found in the nature in our observations the topography around most headlands deepens sharply compared to the beach bathymetries adjacent to it whereas the topography within most bays has a milder slope moreover the study by george 2016 investigated circulation and sediment transport at headlands and by doing so he categorized different headlands in the california coast appendix 1 of that study presents a database of classified headlands the size of the headland perimeter used in the present modeling work is consistent with most the headlands listed in the aforementioned database the bay used in the study is just the symmetric inverse of the headland but as will be explained in section 4 it generates mega rips similar to the one observed around a submarine canyon off la jolla ca near the scripps research pier long and özkan haller 2005 thus we construct smooth topographies h 0 x y of the headland and bay domains accordingly then add the random field h x y and again limit its offshore extent the smooth topography in these cases does not have an offshore bar 3 effects of irregular topography this section analyzes the cases with a straight shoreline and demonstrates the differences between smooth and irregular topographies if the alongshore uniformity of h is broken e g by adding rip channels then offshore directed rip currents will form both steady and transient section 1 to trigger flow instabilities small perturbations i e random noise in the order of 10 5 m s 1 are sometimes added to the velocity field at an early time but after currents have arisen in our irregular bathymetry cases we do not need to add perturbations to the velocity field because the instabilities develop almost from the beginning with all incident wave angles however with increasing θ the instabilities are suppressed we define a surf eddy as a deviation of vorticity from an alongshore average within the nearshore region and eddies can be either time varying transient or steady in time standing note that identification of the eddies was done visually where we consider an eddy as a closed circulation as an illustration of the current field fig 3 shows the instantaneous surface vertical vorticity for smooth and irregular barred cases with alternative wave incident angles θ 0 top panels and θ 40 bottom panels at the end of the simulation at the 12th hour of integration surf eddies do not develop in the smooth case when the waves are normally incident in other words having a smooth alongshore uniform topography does not generate any appreciable currents so there is no possible instability for their generation with irregular topography however currents do develop and become unstable due to their horizontal shear and the resulting surf eddies are nearly isotropic in their horizontal pattern fig 3b if the waves are obliquely incident then an alongshore current arises from the breaking wave acceleration and horizontal shear instabilities ensue fig 3c with irregular topography the surface vertical vorticity is enhanced for obliquely incident waves but the current instability is suppressed the surf eddies are now almost entirely steady in time i e standing eddies rather than transient ones fig 3d the sensitivity test in appendix b shows that with a somewhat lowered bar height transient eddies still occur with irregular topography and large θ albeit still weaker than the standing eddies in that regime 3 1 eddy kinetic energy e k e we quantify surf eddy activity with the time averaged eddy kinetic energy e k e we decompose the fields into time averaged and transient eddy components ϕ ϕ ϕ where an overbar denotes time averaging a prime denotes deviation from the time average a further decomposition of ϕ can be made into an alongshore averaged component ϕ and its standing eddy deviation ϕ s ϕ ϕ where angle brackets denote the alongshore average 1 1 with a variable h the only meaningful alongshore average of a 3d field is one at constant x y the terrain a free surface following coordinate in roms rather than one at constant z that would multiply intersect the bottom thus the total field is 6 ϕ ϕ ϕ s ϕ and ϕ s ϕ is the total eddy component furthermore the time and alongshore averaged variance is 7 ϕ 2 ϕ 2 ϕ s 2 ϕ 2 the first right side term in 7 is the variance of the mean and the second and third terms are the variances of the standing and transient eddies respectively this decomposition is applied to the velocity and then depth integrated and multiplied by 1 2 to calculate mean standing eddy and transient eddy kinetic energies 3 d velocity vectors are u w where u u v is the velocity vector in the horizontal direction and w is the velocity in the vertical direction the total eddy kinetic energy e k e is the sum of the standing and transient components steady rip currents would contribute through the standing e k e fig 4 shows clearly that irregular barred topography is highly energetic even when the waves are normally incident solid black line 2 2 for eke and the shear production terms p in 9 10 we compute 3d fields with time averages then depth integrate using the mean surface height for wave averaged currents η c x y and where indicated take an additional alongshore or area average this procedure overlooks an additional nonlinearity in averages associated with the variable η c η c η c this neglected effect is small in both quantities for normally and slightly oblique waves the transient eddy component makes up about one half of the total e k e this indicates generation of energetic eddies due to the irregularities in the topography as the incident wave angle increases transient eddies start to disappear and standing eddies dominate compare the solid blue line versus solid red line in contrast because there is not a mean current to generate instabilities the e k e is almost zero for smooth topography for normal and near normal incident wave angles dashed black line with increasing incident wave angle the transient eddy component increases due to shear instabilities dashed red line while the standing eddy component is zero apart from finite time sampling error thus we conclude that the dominant e k e components change between alongshore uniform and irregular topographies similar behaviors occur in the planar beach cases fig 5 even though depth induced breaking occurs with the same total wave dissipation hence with the same total current acceleration it is more spatially diffused on a planar beach so the currents are broader and weaker compared to the depth induced breaking with smooth barred topography thus the kinetic energy generated due to depth induced breaking is also much smaller the e k e values for the irregular planar beach topography is similar to the one for irregular barred topography but somewhat weaker notice that the planar smooth topography does not generate shear waves in all these solutions there is an important dependency on the bottom drag both its functional form and the amplitude of its coefficient and thus the drag parameterization is an important element of surf zone modeling we chose not to make this a focus of this paper refer to uchiyama et al 2009 sec 4 to learn more about the bottom drag parameterization dependency 3 2 alongshore averaged current previous studies have shown that the stokes drift u s t tends to cancel the eulerian velocity in the inner shelf fewings et al 2008 however this is not always true resulting in a non zero lagrangian velocity 8 u l u u s t cross shore profiles of the depth and time and alongshore averaged eulerian and lagrangian velocities and stokes drift are in fig 6 these include both irregular solid lines and smooth dashed lines barred topographies the eulerian cross shore velocities u are close to each other for all cases shown with the exception of sb40 and ib40 where θ 40 the maximum angle examined eulerian velocities in the alongshore direction v differ significantly between irregular and smooth cases with θ 10 but then became more similar at highly oblique incident angles in the x far field v decreases somewhat slowly and has an appreciable amplitude for oblique waves this is due to the bottom drag wave dissipation that in turn provides an along wave acceleration of the current at the bottom uchiyama et al 2010 it persists as far offshore as the wave orbital velocity reaches to the bottom we performed sensitivity studies not shown and found that the alongshore current in the offshore region is quite sensitive to the particular functional form of this wave bottom drag parameterization even though the behavior around the surf zone is robust this parameterization gives rise to bottom streaming currents more research is needed on whether its prescriptions are accurate stokes drift in the cross shore direction u s t has the same order of magnitude as the mean eulerian velocity u however the resulting u l is almost as large in the smooth topography cases but smaller than the irregular ones v s t is relatively small though variable among the cases in particular between irregular and smooth topographies so v l v which itself is quite different among the cases although not shown the mean lagrangian cross shore depth integrated transport u l defined in 12 is essentially zero as it should be in an equilibrium state cross shore sections of u l for irregular and smooth barred topographies are in fig 7 the pattern of u l is dominated by the eulerian rip currents in all cases the dominant pattern is a shoreward surface current accompanied by an offshore flow at depth undertow above and just outside the bar this primary overturning circulation is strongest for normal and slightly oblique angles in both smooth and irregular topographies near the bar there is a weak reverse overturning circulation that is stronger with smooth topography and smaller θ in the offshore region the bottom flow is shoreward because of bottom streaming associated with the shoreward waves section 3 2 with a compensating offshore flow above to achieve a zero depth integral 3 3 eddy mean kinetic energy conversion the overall energy cycle for surf currents is a kinetic source from the acceleration due to wave breaking and a sink primarily due to bottom drag although lateral momentum diffusion also contributes there is an exchange with potential energy as well due to the free surface elevation but it is secondary compared to the kinetic energy cycle the mean currents can be unstable and convert mean to eddy kinetic energy and then the eddies can be an important route to total current dissipation to assess the energy conversion from time mean kinetic energy to transient e k e we calculate the horizontal shear production term p m s t whose integrand is the product of eddy reynolds stress and mean horizontal shear 9 p m s t u u u x u v v x v v v y u v u y with a further integration over the depth m 3 s 3 the subscript notation for p in 9 is based on the energy decomposition implied in 7 it is a conversion from the total time averaged flow i e the sum of the alongshore mean m and standing eddy s components to the transient eddy t component a positive sign of p means kinetic energy conversion from the time mean flow to the transient fluctuations i e transient eddy generation a two signed pattern indicates mixed eddy mean energy conversion with an implication of spatial transport connecting the two regions the horizontal average of p determines the net conversion m 5 s 3 table 4 the p m s t term for different cases is shown in fig 8 recall from fig 1 which shows the horizontal view of the domains used that for this particular irregular topographic realization there are three rip channels with varying widths located at around 80 m 200 m and 600 m respectively the largest p m s t conversion coincides with these channels fig 8d at θ 0 as anticipated with rip currents there are regions of mixed sign for p as the incident wave angle increases the magnitude of the p m s t decreases although it remains significant for all θ in contrast with smooth topography p m s t is nearly zero for normal incident waves and it increases with θ p m s t reaches a similar magnitude at θ 40 as in the irregular cases even though its total e k e is less fig 4 this is the expected signature of transient shear instability of the alongshore current it is nearly uniform alongshore in all cases p is mostly confined to the bar region although it does reach inside the bar as well in the case with normal incidence over irregular topography after taking a y average p m s t is positive for almost all x values in all cases this is reflected in the positive area integrated values in the first row of table 4 we can also consider other mean eddy conversions as defined in these alternative shear production terms p m s u s u s u x u s v s v x p m s t u u u s u s u x u v u s v s v x 10 p s t u u u s x u v v s x v v v s y u v u s y whose meanings are evident in their different subscripts the total magnitudes of these various shear production terms are listed in table 4 using the language of horizontal shear instability they indicate the following energy pathways for normal incident waves and smooth topography there is little instability and little e k e for normal incident waves and irregular topography the standing eddies s are unstable and transfer energy to both the alongshore mean flow m and the transient eddies t for oblique waves and smooth topography the instability is from m to t with little exchange with s for oblique waves and irregular topography m is strongly unstable to s and the conversions to t are moderate 3 4 wave energy because of cew the wave field is modulated by interactions with the current as well as with the variable topography previous rip current yu and slinn 2003 and weir et al 2011 show how cew weakens the rip currents and their instability especially for smaller values of θ by comparing with solutions in which cew is neglected here all solutions include cew through full wave current coupling section 2 1 the results discussed below are not shown since the all the cases smooth and irregular barred topography cases exhibit similar behavior we first discuss the alongshore and time averaged sea level and significant wave height crossing the bar the waves begin to break and dissipate and the sea level rises shoreward as wave setup longuet higgins and stewart 1962 there is a modest indication of wave setdown and amplification just offshore of the bar a secondary round of breaking and setup occurs close to the shore at x 1 m depth in a broad view all cases have similar behavior although the irregular topographies induce somewhat greater dissipation and setup next we discuss the wave energy for all the smooth and irregular barred topographies wave energy is calculated from the linear wave theory at leading order in wave steepness the time averaged wave energy for all barred topography cases shows a broad pattern of e w decreasing shoreward from the bar there is also evident modulation of the waves in the irregular topography cases for θ 20 the magnitude of e w is similar for both smooth and irregular cases for θ 20 highest wave energy is seen where the rip channels are located i e in this h realization at 80 m 200 m and 600 m in the alongshore and 120 m in the cross shore direction these are sites of wave amplification and enhanced dissipation partly through the cew associated with the offshore rip currents there 3 5 horizontal transport the lagrangian horizontal volume transport or mass flux when multiplied by ρ 0 in this boussinesq model is defined as 11 u l h η c u u s t d z h u b t u s t u b t is the depth averaged barotropic velocity and u s t is the depth integrated stokes transport uchiyama et al 2010 when time averaged the lagrangian mean transport is 12 u l h u b t h u b t u s t u e u m u s t where the first right side term is the mean eddy induced eulerian transport the second term is the eulerian transport by the mean flow and the last term is the stokes transport the second right side line in 12 is a more compact notation for the terms in the first line notice that the occurrence of surf eddies allows for there to be eddy contributions to eddy induced mean flow the familiar one from surface gravity waves u s t and another from the rectified transport by surf eddies u e in the context of oceanic mesoscale eddy material fluxes the isopycnal layer thickness weighted eddy induced transports are a significant element in general circulation dynamics gent et al 1995 the dynamical processes that generate these different types of eddy induced transport are different of course and as yet there is no clear explanation for this surf eddy manifestation 3 3 it is well known that shallow water gravity waves generate a non zero stokes transport but in our incident wave averaged roms wec model the solutions in our present cases exhibit relatively weak infra gravity wave behavior so here u e 0 is due mainly to surf eddy dynamics following yu and slinn 2003 we examine the transport in the x direction associated with the rip currents as the alongshore average of the positive portion of the depth and time averaged u m u e which is shown in fig 9 4 4 subscript denotes average of the positive portion there are striking differences between the cases first the net rip transport is quite small for all the smooth barred topography cases even though it can be locally large due to transient surf eddies with irregular topography it is much larger but somewhat it decreases with θ especially in comparing normal and oblique incident cases this is consistent with decreasing e k e with θ fig 4 yu and slinn 2003 report a similar pattern in their simulations with uniformly spaced rip channel topography in our cases we generated topographies that are random in the alongshore direction here we see an across shore transport that is much stronger and extends much further than in their simulations this indicates that irregular topography is significant in transporting materials offshore however it should be also noted that the present study does not take into account the type of wave breaking spilling plunging which also impacts the direction of transport of materials in the surf zone the components of mean transport in 12 are shown in fig 10 for irregular barred topography this shows an eddy induced transport directed primarily alongshore in the surf zone with a direction reversing pattern in y for normal incident waves the eddy and mean transport components show some recirculations observe the direction of the transport vectors on the other hand for oblique waves the eddy and mean transport components are aligned along the shore the magnitude of u e is smaller than u m where it is largest in the surf zone its peak value is only 5 10 as large for smooth barred topography not shown u m is very small for normal waves because there is little transient eddy activity and it has a comparable relative size for oblique waves for oblique waves the total transport offshore is southward in the direction of the waves the transport due to the stokes drift is comparable in magnitude to the eddy induced transport in these irregular topography cases with a straight coastline but with a very different spatial pattern n b fig 6 in an additional alongshore average we can further decompose the mean transport by separating standing and transient eddies 13 u l h u b t h s u b t s h u b t u s t u t e u s e u m u s t where the definitions should be evident from the symbols for the same solutions as in fig 9 with irregular topography u t e is again about 4 of u m for normal incident waves while the relative magnitude of u s e is close to 35 for oblique waves u t e and u s e are each about 10 as large as u m within the surf zone inner 100 m in x but smaller farther offshore thus the surf eddy induced mean transports are non trivial in these cases although the primary transport is by the mean currents 4 effects of coastline shape the usual practice in idealized rip current studies is to have a straight coastline and as far as we know most field measurements in the surf have been measured for a similar geometry in this section we examine the influence of a variable shoreline on generating and interacting with rip currents as explained in section 2 the topographies of the headland and bay cases are sloped downward and seaward with superimposed random depth perturbations i e there are no bars in these cases in this section we do not consider alongshore averages because of the inhomogeneity in this direction 4 1 headlands the surface vertical vorticity around the headland for different incident waveangles at the 24th hour of the simulation is illustrated in fig 11 highly energetic small scale surf eddies are generated along the straight sectors of the coastline with normal and nearly normal incident wave angles they persist for all incident angles but weaken and contract shoreward with larger θ the surf eddies on both sides of the headland are suppressed in addition for θ 20 a strong alongshore current develops on the wave exposed side of the headland with strong nearshore negative surface vertical vorticity due to increased bottom drag in shallow water this flow separates at the headland leaving the wave sheltered side relatively inactive not evident from the figures because it is a wave driven current shaped by the irregular domain geometry we refer to it as a mega rip current it extends seaward far beyond the surf zone where the waves break to understand the transport around the headland we again utilize the transport decomposition 12 components of the transport and their sum at different incident wave angles are shown in fig 12 when the waves are normally incident top panels in addition to the local irregular topography standing eddies in the surf zone we see two large circulating patterns in the regions next to the headland right around the headland the transport is negative i e directed towards shore and away from the headlands there is a compensating offshore flow the relative size of u e compared to u m is larger in this headland case than with a straight coastline section 4 i e as large as about 50 based on the maximum in one computational cell locally within the surf zone when the waves are obliquely incident bottom panels the transport is mainly directed along the incident wave direction towards south with an especially strong separating flow at the headland tip in this case the eddy induced flows are positioned differently and are somewhat weaker compared to the mean current transport 4 2 bays fig 13 is an analogous illustration of the surface vertical vorticity around the bay for different incident wave angles at the 24th hour of the simulations along the straight sectors of the coast the behavior of the small surf eddies is quite similar to that for the headland fig 11 a striking feature in these cases is the mega rips extending far offshore around the bay the mega rip pattern is broadly a dipole with inflows at the bay edges and a central outflow the dipole is approximately symmetric with normal incident waves but it is tilted alongshore with oblique waves in the wave direction the offshore directed flow from the bay center is shear unstable and tends to meander around its primary axis similar mega rips were observed around a submarine canyon off la jolla ca near the scripps research pier which is much deeper than our idealized bay 30 40 m long and özkan haller 2005 studied the mega rip generated at this location and reported that rip current generation was very sensitive to the topographic irregularities rather than presence of the canyon we did not repeat our simulation without the h perturbations but based on the results in the previous section we would expect a similar result that irregularness enhances variability here the mega rip interacts with the smaller rip currents for all of the incident wave angles this implies that materials transported by the smaller rip currents would be transported even further offshore through this interaction with the mega rip circulation fig 14 shows the transport around the bay for different incident wave angles the eddy induced flow patterns generated due to the bay are stronger more complicated and extend farther offshore than in the headland cases but again its magnitude relative to the mean current transport is larger than with only a straight coastline fig 12 the transport direction is affected significantly because of the mega rip the mean current and total lagrangian alongshore transports are enhanced by the presence of the bay and are strongest while exiting on the down wave side in the headland and bay cases with relatively larger eddy induced transports compared to straight coastline cases fig 12 the stokes transport is smaller than the eddy induced transport thus variations in coastline shape have an important influence on wave driven currents and surf eddies the variety of shapes in nature is large and here we only show two examples to illustrate the influences 5 summary and discussion in this paper we present results from 52 idealized cases for wave driven surf currents over various topographies and coastline shapes using the roms wec model uchiyama et al 2010 the cases are divided into two case groups where in the first group we investigate topographic control on transient rip currents by introducing irregularities to commonly used alongshore uniform topographies in the second group idealized headland and bay domains with topographic irregularities are examined for their influences on transient rip currents in both groups the role of the incident wave angle is examined while the other incident wave properties are held constant the results from the first group show that if the topography in the alongshore direction has irregular undulations instabilities are triggered even at normally incident wave angles with increasing incident angle shear instabilities dominate over topographic instabilities and the surf eddies transition from being mostly transient to being mostly steady the surf e k e is enhanced by the presence of irregular topography this enhancement is greatest for nearly normal incidence which is the attracting direction for depth induced refraction over shoaling bathymetry the second group cases with idealized headland and bay configurations reveal how the flow field changes when the coastline shape changes the headland acts like an obstruction especially at high incident wave angles and we observe flow separation followed by offshore wake instabilities the bay however acts like a large rip channel generating transient mega rips with large scale recirculating flow patterns that intrude out from the coast several kilometers offshore when the waves are normally incident in flows with significant transient eddies an eddy induced mean transport often occurs and can be large in relation e g to the mean stokes transport it also often provides a fractional opposition to the mean current transport that dominates the total lagrangian transport the eddy induced transport is enhanced by irregular topography just as is the e k e these eddy induced transports are modest fractions of the mean current and total transports in the idealized cases with straight coastline and relatively small scale topographic irregularities and they are relatively stronger with coastline shape variations nevertheless they do demonstrate the potential importance of surf turbulence in providing a lagrangian mean advective material transport as well as the more familiar behaviors of eddy induced dispersion and dilution of material concentrations the results of this study demonstrate that topographic and coastline variations are significant influences on surf eddy activity thus for realistic surf behaviors it is important to use either measured bathymetry if available or at least include a plausible degree of irregularity and coastline variation in the simulation beyond the steady wave forcing considered here both incident wave variability and other forms of shelf current variability are also necessary ingredients for realistic surf eddy simulations finally it should be noted that the currents in the surf zone can also further be influenced by tidal forces large oceanic scale thermohaline differences and river discharges moreover truly irregular wave fields with special dynamics e k e surface vertical vorticity velocity fields induced by realistic random wave trains could be achieved only by coupling roms with proper wave models 3rd generation or boussinesq type and cfd approaches so that other crucial wave processes can be incorporated in simulations such as wave triad interactions wave reflections on the coast surf beat cross shore wave dynamics wave

procedure explained in section 2 2 and generate two more random realizations of the topographic perturbations h x y which then are superimposed on the alongshore uniform barred topography fig a 1 time histories of the instantaneous eddy kinetic energy i e e k e t calculated using the eddy velocity u u are shown in fig a 2 for these three realizations v1 is the control case sb0 and v2 and v3 are two other random realizations otherwise all parameters for the three cases are the same notice that v4 is not included in fig a 2 and will be discussed in appendix b the e k e t varies over a 50 range but the different cases curves overlap substantially with each other and have a similar time average this implies that repeating the simulations given in table 1 with different realizations would yield in similar statistical results because the size and location of the rip channels are different in each case the detailed pattern of the rip currents would be different but the results leading to our conclusions would be essentially similar appendix b sensitivity to bar height we examine the time series of e k e components standing and transient for different barred topography realizations we use four cases where when alongshore averaging applied the height of the bar in v1 v2 and v3 is the same whereas the bar top is deepened in v4 the components of the e k e and its total decline when the bar top is deepened however the transient e k e component is noticeably larger for large θ with the deepened bar and relatively weak transient eddies are observed at large incident angle appendix c sensitivity to roughness factor s 0 here we vary s 0 between 1 and 0 where 1 yields the full perturbation amplitude in 5 to assess how the topographic irregularness amplitude controls the surf eddy activity as expected and consistent with the results in uchiyama et al 2017 smaller perturbation size led to lower e k e and therefore less energetic flow field with less instabilities appendix d sensitivity to wave amplitude a now we vary the offshore wave amplitude a and plot the resulting e k e values fig d 1 for small a the rate of increase in e k e is large but there is a saturation effect for larger a i e increased incident wave energy hence increased wave dissipation and current acceleration lead to increased current dissipation such that e k e does not increase further appendix e sensitivity to horizontal viscosity ν as a final sensitivity test we compared solutions with irregular barred topography and a straight coastline using the standard lateral momentum eddy viscosity of ν 1 m 2 s 1 and the alternative value of zero in both cases the third order upstream horizontal advection provides an implicit hyper diffusion that adapts to both the grid and the flow in extensive experience with roms this implicit diffusion is often sufficient to maintain smoothness on the grid scale shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 results are shown in fig e 1 as expected the explicit ν 0 is unnecessary for stability and the e k e is enhanced without it the enhancement is more substantial for normal incident waves than oblique waves because the ensuing surf turbulence in the former case has a wider range of scales and a more active kinetic energy cascade fig 3 thus our conclusion about topographic enhancement of surf eddy activity would be even stronger with smaller ν bennis et al 2011 reported that cew will be diminished for ν values greater than 2 5 m2 s 1 and the ν value used in the present study is 2 5 times smaller than this limit appendix f eddy mean induced transport mean stokes drift comparison with varying wave amplitude finally we examined the effect of wave amplitude on eddy mean induced transport and mean stokes drift which is shown in fig f 1 eddy mean induced transport is highest onshore after the bar for all cases as expected eddy mean transport shows an increasing trend with increasing wave amplitude with the exception for a 0 25 and a 0 5 u e with a 0 5 is much smaller than the u e with a 0 25 for x 150 m for a 0 75 the peak values of u e are indistinguishable whereas mean stokes drift keeps increasing with increasing wave amplitude 
23988,the model of coastal waves based on the depth averaging of the large eddy simulation equations kazakova and richard 2019 is extended to the case of regular and irregular wave trains to take into account a stronger turbulence the third moment of the horizontal velocity is modelled with a gradient diffusion hypothesis the effect of this new diffusive term is to smooth and regularize the solutions an asymptotically equivalent model including the improvement of the dispersive properties is solved with a discontinuous galerkin numerical scheme the model has a low sensitivity to the space discretization parameters several classical test cases of wave trains are used to validate the model in the shoaling zone the model is similar to the serre green naghdi equations but the inclusion of a variable called enstrophy to take into account the large scale turbulence and the non uniformity of the mean velocity improves the predictive ability in the inner surf zone in particular the turbulent energy of the model is dissipated within one wave cycle and is transported shoreward in the case of waves with a long period whereas in the case of short periods it is mostly transported seaward because its dissipation is far from being complete within one period the case of an irregular wave train propagating over a submerged bar is simulated without any breaking criterion this benchmark test case validates further the model s ability in predicting the nonlinear effects due to shoaling breaking propagation in a shallow horizontal part and in a deeper region keywords breakers shoaling waves wave breaking waves processes on beaches mathematical models 1 introduction modelling accurately coastal waves is of high importance for applications in coastal erosion and morphodynamics or for the prediction and prevention of extreme events such as great storms for practical problems the size of the computation domain and the duration of the phenomena to be simulated are large and the computation time is an issue this motivates the use of phase averaged models which use a statistical description to calculate the evolution of the wave spectrum however thanks to advances in computer performance numerical schemes and parallel computing the phase resolving models become more and more competitive in these models the sea surface is resolved which necessitates a finer grid a higher accuracy is expected but at the cost of a greater computation time the phase resolving models include the non hydrostatic approach where the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations are solved while the non hydrostatic part of the pressure is calculated by solving an elliptic poisson equation stelling and zijlema 2003 ma et al 2012 derakhti et al 2016a considerable efforts have reduced the vertical resolution needed to reproduce accurately wave breaking from a high value of 10 20 layers to a few layers either by using a breaking criterion removing locally the non hydrostatic part of the pressure smit et al 2013 or by a superior numerical treatment using terrain and surface following σ coordinates derakhti et al 2016b these improvements lead to a significantly reduced computational cost in the other phase resolving models traditionally called boussinesq type models the equations of fluid dynamics are averaged over the depth the non hydrostatic part of the pressure is evaluated from the depth and its derivatives which induces third order derivatives in the model and an elliptic step in the numerical resolution reviews on boussinesq type models can be found in brocchini 2013 and kirby 2016 when propagating shoreward the waves steepen in the shoaling zone where the dispersive effects are dominant strictly speaking the boussinesq equations boussinesq 1872 peregrine 1967 are derived with a weak nonlinearity hypothesis the wave amplitude is much smaller than the water depth which entails some discrepancies in shallow water areas fully nonlinear equations were first derived by serre 1953 in the one dimensional 1d case and extended in the two dimensional 2d case by green et al 1974 and green and naghdi 1976 and are called in this paper the serre green naghdi equations fully nonlinear models are more accurate than the boussinesq equations in particular in the final stages of coastal waves propagation where the wave amplitude is no longer small in comparison to the depth wei and kirby 1995 barthélemy 2004 lannes and bonneton 2009 but they are still weakly dispersive because of the shallow water assumption see for example kirby 2016 which implies that their validity is restricted to small depths various techniques were proposed to improve the dispersive properties of these equations and thus to increase their validity domain in particular nwogu 1993 and wei et al 1995 considered the velocity at an arbitrary depth instead of the depth averaged velocity and bonneton et al 2011 lannes and marche 2015 and do carmo et al 2018 derived an asymptotically equivalent system of equations wave breaking and breakers propagation in the surf zone require to model dissipative effects this was achieved by different approaches the roller models are based on the concept of surface roller svendsen 1984 viewed as a volume of water carried by the wave at the wave velocity schäffer et al 1993 madsen et al 1997 this method leads to several developments in particular with the inclusion of the vorticity in the model veeramony and svendsen 2000 briganti et al 2004 musumeci et al 2005 viviano et al 2015 or through diffusive type terms on both the mass and momentum equations cienfuegos et al 2010 this approach requires to calibrate several parameters notably for the breaking criterion and the determination of the roller geometry another strategy is to model turbulence effects in breaking waves by an eddy viscosity heitner and housner 1970 zelt 1991 kennedy et al 2000 in some models an equation for the turbulent kinetic energy is solved to calculate the eddy viscosity nwogu 1996 karambas and tozer 2003 zhang et al 2014 kazolea and ricchiuto 2018 a turbulent viscosity approach assumes a local balance between production and dissipation and an isotropic turbulence the hybrid models with a switching method are another way to take into account the dissipative effects bonneton et al 2011 tonelli and petti 2011 tissier et al 2012 kazolea et al 2014 filippini et al 2016 duran and marche 2017 by removing the dispersive terms the serre green naghdi equations reduce to the saint venant equations which being hyperbolic produce discontinuities in finite time which dissipate energy a breaking criterion is needed to determine when the dispersive terms should be switched off and a breaking termination criterion determines when they should be switched on this method suffers from numerical problems in particular mesh grid sensitivity and non physical oscillations filippini et al 2016 kazolea and ricchiuto 2018 a new approach based on depth averaging the large eddy simulation les equations was proposed by kazakova and richard 2019 in the 1d case and extended to the 2d case by richard et al 2019 in both cases mostly for solitary waves the large scale turbulence is explicitly resolved in a depth averaged sense with its anisotropic properties while the small scale turbulence is modelled through a turbulent viscosity hypothesis while there is some similarity with the eddy viscosity strategy because of the introduction of an eddy viscosity for the small scale turbulence the originality of this approach lies in the anisotropic tensor modelling the large scale turbulence which satisfies a tensor equation there is thus no need to assume neither an approximate balance between the production and the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy nor an isotropic turbulence which is not always satisfied in the large scales the resulting equations have the special hyperbolic structure of teshukov 2007 with additional source terms the goal of the present paper is to validate this approach in the more general case of periodic and random wave trains with a special attention to the turbulence dynamics the dynamics of surf zone turbulence was studied experimentally by ting and kirby 1994 1995 1996 who found that the turbulent kinetic energy is transported seaward under a spilling breaker whereas it is transported landward and dissipated within one wave cycle in the case of a plunging breaker it is interesting to see if the depth averaged les approach predicts a similar behaviour in section 2 the equations of the model of kazakova and richard 2019 are extended to the case of a stronger turbulence which requires modelling the third moment of the horizontal velocity distribution in the vertical direction in section 3 the numerical scheme is presented together with the treatment of wave breaking in section 4 the model is validated by numerical simulations of experiments on wave trains obtained by cox 1995 ting and kirby 1994 and beji and battjes 1993 2 equations of the model 2 1 depth averaging procedure the main idea of the derivation of the model equations is to average over the depth the les equations the details are given in kazakova and richard 2019 and only the main points and the differences from the original derivation are given here only two dimensional flows are considered here which leads to a 1d model details on the derivation of the 2d model are given in richard et al 2019 starting from the navier stokes equations of incompressible fluids with a density ρ and a kinematic viscosity ν a filtering operation decomposes the velocity field v into a filtered component v and a residual component v r i e v v v r the cutoff frequency is in the inertial subrange so that the filtered field includes the energy containing motions the residual stress tensor is modelled with a turbulent viscosity hypothesis contrary to the usual les approach the eddy viscosity of the residual motions denoted by ν t x t is not modelled by the smagorinsky closure but is supposed to be uniform over the depth i e independent of z this simplification is sufficient for a depth averaged model another important result is the equality of the dissipation of the mean residual kinetic energy and its rate of production lilly 1967 the notations are given in fig 1 we denote by g the gravity acceleration h the total water depth h 0 the still water depth b the elevation of the bottom topography over a horizontal datum and z h b denoting by l the wavelength or the order of magnitude of a horizontal length and by h 0 a reference value of the still water depth the equations are derived with an asymptotic method based on the existence of the small parameter 1 μ h 0 l 1 of the shallow water assumption which is also responsible for the weakly dispersive properties of the equations the reynolds number is high so that all terms due to the molecular viscosity are negligible as in theoretical or experimental works svendsen 1987 beji and battjes 1993 cox 1995 antuono and brocchini 2013 and zhang et al 2014 the eddy viscosity is supposed to be of o μ which means that a dimensionless eddy viscosity writes 2 ν t ν t μ h 0 g h 0 note however that the eddy viscosity is here relative only to the small scale turbulence the averaged value of any quantity a over the depth is defined as 3 a 1 h b h b a d z for the depth averaging procedure the horizontal filtered velocity is decomposed as 4 u x z t u x t u x z t where u is the averaged value of u over the depth and u the deviation of the filtered velocity to this average value this deviation includes the large scale turbulence and the depth variations of the mean non turbulent velocity the flow is supposed to be weakly turbulent and weakly sheared as in teshukov 2007 richard and gavrilyuk 2012 and castro and lannes 2014 this means that 5 u o μ β where β 0 the averaging of the momentum equation in the o x direction gives a term u 2 in the flux the dimensionless filtered horizontal velocity is defined by u u g h 0 since by definition u 0 u 2 u 2 μ 2 β u 2 the second central moment is written with the help of the quantity 6 φ 1 h 3 b h b u 2 d z u 2 h 2 which has the same dimension as the square of a vorticity and is called enstrophy note that in the study of turbulent flows the enstrophy has other definitions because the enstrophy is the third variable of the model the two other ones being the fluid depth h and the average velocity u a third equation must be derived to close the system beside the averaged mass and momentum equations this equation can be obtained by averaging over the depth the balance equation for the kinetic energy of the filtered motions the enstrophy appears also in the energy of the model moreover in the energy flux it appears the third moment of the filtered velocity which can be written in dimensionless form with h h h 0 and φ h 0 φ g u 3 u 3 3 μ 2 β h 2 u φ μ 3 β u 3 the third central moment is of o μ 3 β castro and lannes 2014 and kazakova and richard 2019 took β 1 the leading dispersive and viscous terms are of o μ 2 and all terms of o μ 3 are neglected by taking β 1 the third central moment can be consistently neglected in this paper we take 7 0 β 1 so that the turbulence can be stronger and that u 3 must be consistently kept in the model this implies that either an equation for u 3 must be provided as in castro and lannes 2014 or that u 3 must be modelled since highly turbulent flows can be modelled with the weak turbulence or weak shear approximation richard 2013 gavrilyuk et al 2016 it is expected that the influence of u 3 is small the derivation of an equation for this quantity would greatly complicate the model for very little benefit we choose instead to model this quantity with a gradient diffusion hypothesis by analogy with the study of turbulent flows the enstrophy equation can be derived from the depth averaged mass momentum and energy equations because the enstrophy equation is much simpler than the energy equation and since the viscous terms prevent discontinuities from arising the final system which is solved numerically is composed of the mass momentum and enstrophy equations the enstrophy equation can be written 8 h φ t h u φ x 8 ν t h u x 2 2 h ε 1 h 2 x h u 3 this equation differs from the enstrophy equation derived by kazakova and richard 2019 only from the last term with the third central moment the quantity ε is the depth averaged dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy a simple gradient diffusion model is 9 u 3 2 ν t σ h 2 φ x where σ is a turbulent prandtl number which is generally taken equal to 1 in the models of turbulent flows see for example pope 2000 p 371 the enstrophy equation becomes 10 h φ t h u φ x 8 ν t h u x 2 2 h ε 2 h 2 x ν t σ h 3 φ x an even simpler way to model the last term is to write it in a conservative form as 11 h φ t h u φ x 8 ν t h u x 2 2 h ε x 2 ν t σ h φ x since the numerical resolution will show that the effect of this term is negligible for reasonable values of σ i e larger than 0 1 except that it helps to smooth the solutions at the breaking point where there is a sudden increase of enstrophy the main term to be kept is the diffusion term in practice no difference between 10 and 11 has been noticed in the numerical simulations the closure of the model requires expressions for the turbulent viscosity and for the dissipation as in kazakova and richard 2019 these expressions are 12 ν t h 2 φ r where r is a dimensionless quantity which can be interpreted as a reynolds number and 13 ε c r 2 h 2 φ 3 2 where c r is a dimensionless enstrophy dissipation coefficient this expression of the dissipation guarantees the positivity of the enstrophy the equations of the model write 14 h t h u x 0 15 h u t x h u 2 g h 2 2 h 3 φ h 2 h 3 π x 4 r h 3 φ u x g h b x f and 16 h φ t h u φ x 8 h φ r u x 2 c r h φ 3 2 x 2 h 3 φ σ r φ x the notations ḧ π and f refer to 17 h h u x 2 h 2 u x t h u 2 u x 2 18 π h 2 2 d d t u b x and 19 f h b x h 2 d d t u b x where the material derivative is d d t t u x these equations are rewritten in an asymptotically equivalent way firstly to simplify the numerical resolution section 2 2 and secondly to improve the linear dispersive properties section 2 3 2 2 asymptotically equivalent model the model formed by eqs 14 16 presents the difficulty for the numerical resolution to have mixed third order derivatives in space and time in the momentum equation 15 following the ideas of bonneton et al 2011 and lannes and marche 2015 an asymptotically equivalent model is derived with a mathematical structure more suited to the numerical resolution only the main steps of the method are recalled here and we refer to lannes and marche 2015 for the details and justifications the equations are written in dimensionless form with a classical scaling see for example antuono and brocchini 2013 in particular the elevation b of the bottom topography is supposed to be of o h 0 and the characteristic length of its variation in the o x direction is l this implies that b x o μ in dimensionless form the momentum equation 15 can be written kazakova and richard 2019 20 h u t x h u 2 h 2 2 μ 2 β h 3 φ μ 2 h 2 h 3 μ 2 π μ 2 x 4 r h 3 φ u

corresponds to the first term at the right hand side of 21 whereas the quantity q 1 gathers the terms corresponding to the last term of 21 and all topographic terms which do not include the material

numerical resolution using the still water depth this method decreases markedly the computation time and is efficient and robust lannes and marche 2015 2 3 optimization of the dispersive properties the serre green naghdi equations are weakly dispersive their dispersive properties are accurate while the depth is not too large more precisely until k h 0 1 chazel et al 2011 where k is the wavenumber for practical applications a larger validity domain is often required which implies to use an optimization technique the optimization procedure of bonneton et al 2011 can be easily adapted

velocity until k h 0 2 5 and the shoaling coefficient until k h 0 2 bonneton et al 2011 chazel et al 2011 3 numerical aspects neglecting the o μ 2 β residuals in 33 and going back to variables with dimensions the final set of equations completed with 14 and 16 is discretized on the basis of the discontinuous galerkin scheme proposed by duran and marche 2015 originally designed for the 1d serre green naghdi equations from a numerical viewpoint the extension to the present model consists in a slight modification of the momentum equation and the addition of a transport equation in the discrete formulation as concerns the enstrophy transport the conservative terms are treated in the hyperbolic stage corresponding to the left hand side of 16 while the terms appearing in the right hand side production dissipation and diffusion are computed using a classical collocation method with direct nodal products in the same way as those of the momentum equations overall the adaptation of the scheme can be done without particular technical difficulties and the reader is referred to duran and marche 2015 for implementation details and richard et al 2019 for a 2d extension including enstrophy in the 2d case note however that the presence of viscous terms in the model through 16 and 33 constrains the time step to a parabolic stability condition in practice and especially close to mesh convergence this may entail drastic restrictions on the time step in our simulations we slightly decreased the theoretical cfl hyperbolic condition to take this into account which has been sufficient to ensure stable computations for the considered values of σ ideally these terms should be implicited to get rid of this restriction this task is part of a work currently in progress to improve the global computational efficiency of the scheme as regards the numerical treatment of boundary conditions the generation and absorption of waves are based on classical relaxation techniques see chazel et al 2011 duran and marche 2015 lannes and marche 2015 madsen et al 2003 wei and kirby 1995 allowing to progressively transit from an imposed analytical profile to the numerical solution the computational domain is extended at the inlet boundary and outlet when necessary to include the sponge layers generally calibrated from the wavelength of incoming waves as regards the wave breaking treatment we follow the strategy proposed by kazakova and richard 2019 as reported in this work injecting enstrophy at the very beginning of the computations may have an impact on the amplitude of the waves even outside breaking areas to prevent this the idea is to turn on viscous creation terms in the enstrophy equation only when needed to achieve this a breaking criterion is used relying on the concept of virtual enstrophy denoted ψ in the sequel this new quantity satisfies a second transport equation introduced to evaluate the amount of enstrophy that the model is able to produce but without retroaction on the physical flow variables put in other words the virtual enstrophy is computed exactly as the enstrophy with viscous terms evaluated in the whole computational domain wave breaking can then be characterized by a sudden growth of virtual enstrophy in practice breaking areas are identified as those for which ψ ψ 0 with ψ 0 a threshold to be defined resulting in a local activation of the viscous terms in the effective enstrophy equation it should be noted however that the use of such a tool is unnecessary for simulations implying small relative amplitudes following kazakova and richard 2019 the trigger threshold is thus defined as 35 ψ 0 ψ 0 s g h 0 0 1 0 031 h 0 a if a h 0 0 05 0 otherwise with h 0 the still water depth at the initial position of the wave and a the initial amplitude of the wave regarding the other parameters of the model the dimensionless reynolds number is given by 36 r r 0 0 85 60 s s being the bed slope and the dissipation coefficient present in 16 has the universal value c r 0 48 the eddy viscosity can be written 37 ν t b h 2 φ r with b 0 where ψ ψ 0 and b 1 elsewhere note that these choices proved to be relevant in a large variety of 1d and 2d applications implying solitary waves propagating over non trivial topographies see kazakova and richard 2019 richard et al 2019 thus conferring a predictive character to the model the main purpose of the present work is to investigate its applicability to wave trains as will be seen through the next examples although being almost immediate some specific aspects must be taken into account the main reason is that the enstrophy produced by a single wave is not always dissipated during one period and may be partially recovered by the following ones this can lead to an accumulation phenomenon at the level of the breaking point resulting in a slight underestimation of the wave s amplitude note that these observations are in accordance with the complex turbulent interactions induced by wave trains reported in experimental works see for instance ting and kirby 1994 we shall see that a small increase of the reynolds number or the breaking threshold is sufficient to remedy this problem 4 model validation 4 1 cox s experiment cox 1995 the first test we consider is based on the experimental study carried out by cox 1995 and implies a regular train of cnoidal waves with relative amplitude a h 0 0 29 and period t 2 2 s propagating in a wave flume with a constant bed slope 1 35 the still water level h 0 in the constant depth section of the channel is h 0 0 4 m in this context as the waves approach the shore they start shoaling under the effect of the topography steepen and experience breaking of spilling type the objective is therefore to evaluate the capacity of the present model to faithfully reproduce these characteristics the computational domain is 0 24 and includes a sponge layer of 5 m at the left boundary to allow a proper generation of incident waves the topography is parametrized as follows 38 z x max 0 x 6 35 the time evolution of the free surface was recorded at six wave gauges located at x 10 6 m x 13 m x 14 2 m x 15 4 m x 16 6 m and x 17 8 m as indicated in fig 2 top note that the present configuration leads to ψ 0 ψ 0 s 5 07 s 2 for the breaking threshold as can be seen in fig 2 middle this limit value is reached around x 13 m between wg2 and wg3 which marks the beginning of the breaking area this is in accordance with the experiments and other numerical results tissier et al 2012 from this point we clearly see local entropy peaks follow the breaking of the waves until the shore as noted above looking at virtual and effective enstrophy fig 2 middle and bottom we also observe that the turbulent energy of the model h 2 φ 2 has no time to completely dissipate between two successive waves which is in accordance with the results found by ting and kirby 1994 and ting and kirby 1996 on spilling type breaking part of this energy is thus reintroduced in the train with the effect of slightly decreasing the wave s amplitude as mentioned one possibility is to increase the reynolds number to balance this residual turbulent energy in the presented results it is fixed to r 1 2 r 0 3 08 where r 0 is the reynolds number given by 36 comparison with experimental time series of the free surface is available in fig 3 together with numerical results obtained with a classical switching strategy we observe an overall good agreement especially for the three last gauges where the present model seems in better agreement with structural aspects of the wave in particular breaking waves treated as shock with the switching method tend to present steeper fronts notably at gauge wg4 and wg5 where the present model gives a more accurate profile for both strategies we also notice an underestimation of the wave height at the breaking point which is characteristic of the serre green naghdi solutions these observations are supported by fig 4 giving the spatial distribution of the amplitudes and mean value of the free surface top wave skewness s k middle and wave asymmetry a s bottom these two last quantities are computed as follows kennedy et al 2000 39 s k η η 3 η η 2 3 2 40 a s h η η 3 η η 2 3 2 where h stands for the hilbert transform η is the mean elevation and x is the time averaged value of any quantity x both models are in agreement with the experiments in the shoaling zone before 12 m there are some discrepancies in the breaking zone around 13 14 m since no depth averaged model can describe accurately the breaking process and because the serre green naghdi equations tend to predict waves less peaked than observed waves and thus with a lower skewness in the inner surf zone after 15 m the present model improves significantly the skewness factor and the asymmetry factor compared to the switching model the switching approach underestimates the skewness in the inner surf zone and overestimates markedly the asymmetry since the switching model treats the front of breaking waves as a shock the predicted asymmetry should be much higher than the experimental values the numerical viscosity can decrease somewhat this discrepancy resulting in a deterioration of the solution with mesh refinement in the case of the switching model the calculated mean water level mwl is in agreement with the experiments including the small set down effect and the set up effect the crest and trough elevations relative to the mean water level are also correctly reproduced except as noted above the crest elevation at the breaking point gauges wg2 and wg3 numerical convergence was reached with a space step of δ x 0 02 m a fundamental advantage of the present approach over switching type strategies relies on its low sensitivity with respect to the space discretization parameters indeed very similar results were obtained at higher orders and for more important mesh resolutions reversely switching strategies are less robust since a modification of the space step may entail significant variations of the numerical results and require a new calibration of the breaking parameters see tissier et al 2012 kazolea and ricchiuto 2018 the phenomenon is illustrated in fig 5 which compares our results to those obtained with a switching method for different mesh grids for a given set of breaking parameters we clearly see that numerical convergence is reached with a space step of δ x 0 02 m for the present strategy while for the switching the behaviour of the solution is highly dependent of the mesh size and suggests a systematic readjustment of the parameter set furthermore in the case of the switching model spurious oscillations appear with mesh refinement and these numerical instabilities increase if the cells become thinner which prevents mesh convergence this problem does not take place with our model finally fig 6 reveals the numerical interest of the diffusion term indeed when σ the brutal variations of enstrophy at the level of the breaking zone generate free surface perturbations that propagate offshore and pollute the numerical solution this prevents notably the establishment of a permanent regime a small amount of diffusion on the enstrophy has the effect of damping these strong variations and is sufficient to overcome the problem 4 2 ting and kirby s experiment ting and kirby 1994 based on the same experimental set up ting and kirby 1994 and ting and kirby 1995 conducted a series of works dedicated to the study of breaking wave trains of spilling and plunging type we first focus on the spilling breaker case corresponding to a wave period t 2 s and an amplitude a 0 125 m computations are run on the interval 0 40 and we consider the following topography 41 z x max 0 x 10 35 based on the empirical laws 35 36 the optimal choice for the breaking constants is r 1 3 r 0 3 3 and ψ 0 1 3 ψ 0 s 6 3 s 2 where ψ 0 s is the value given by 35 which are almost the same values as for cox s experiments the numerical results were obtained for a mesh size δ x 0 04 m comparisons between measured and simulated time series of the free surface elevation at several wave gauges located along the domain are available in fig 7 we can observe an overall good agreement except at the breaking point around 27 28 m where the waves have a smaller amplitude and are wider and less peaked we also note that the wave characteristics are particularly well reproduced in the inner surf zone after 28 m in particular we recover the expected amplitudes and observe a faithful reproduction of the steepness profiles these observations are confirmed by the skewness and asymmetry calculations available in fig 8 middle and bottom respectively in particular the estimation of the asymmetry indicators marks a noticeable improvement when compared to switching type strategies tissier et al 2012 surface elevation profiles including wave crest wave trough and mean elevation are given in fig 8 top exhibiting a good agreement with the experiment in line with other works available in the literature see cienfuegos et al 2010 lynett 2006 tissier et al 2012 the skewness coefficient is too small in the breaking zone because the waves are wider and lower but is correctly estimated in the inner surf zone the mean water level presents a noticeable set down effect at 28 m which was not measured in the experiments and a set up effect in accordance with the measured values the crest and trough elevations relative to the mean water level are in agreement with the experiments except for a lower crest elevation at the breaking point the ability of the model to describe the evolution of the turbulent energy can be assessed through fig 9 the time series of the dimensionless turbulent energy are presented as well as the dimensionless velocity at three wave gauges located in the inner surf zone as in the previous case the amount of enstrophy produced by the mechanism of breaking is not dissipated during one period a large proportion is still present in time windows associated with a negative velocity which means that a substantial part of the turbulent energy is carried offshore this result is qualitatively in accordance with ting and kirby 1994 who found that the turbulent kinetic energy is transported seaward under the spilling breaker keeping the same discretization parameters we now turn to the case of the plunging breaker studied by ting and kirby 1995 the period is t 5 s and the amplitude is a 0 128 m the optimal parameters of the model are r 1 2 r 0 3 1 and ψ 0 1 1 ψ 0 s 5 3 s 2 the distributions of wave amplitudes and mean water level given in fig 10 are well reproduced when comparing to experimental results of ting and kirby 1994 as for the spilling breaker case a small set down effect is noticeable in the mean water level curve which was not measured in the experiments the set up at the end of the inner surf zone is in agreement with the measures the calculated crest and trough elevations are very close to the experimental results even the maximum value of the crest elevation at the breaking point which is similar to the experimental value the results available in fig 11 highlight a notable difference with spilling breakers at the level of the breaking point we note that the turbulent energy produced by a single wave has time to dissipate almost completely before the following wave so that each wave is handled independently by its own enstrophy production as a result the amount of turbulent energy carried offshore is very low marking a sharp distinction with respect to spilling breakers the turbulent energy of the model is very small when the averaged velocity is negative seaward which means that the overall turbulent energy transport is shoreward this is in agreement with the result of ting and kirby 1994 who noted that in the case of the plunging breaker the turbulent kinetic energy is transported landward and that it is dissipated within one wave cycle the model is thus able to predict the variations of the turbulent energy and the direction of its transport and to distinguish between the case of a short wave period such as the spilling breaker with t 2 s of ting and kirby 1996 where the turbulent energy is not dissipated within one wave cycle resulting in a seaward transport and the case of a longer wave period as the case of the plunging breaker with t 5 s of ting and kirby 1995 where the turbulent energy is dissipated in one period and transported landward note that the measurements of the turbulent kinetic energy of ting and kirby 1995 and ting and kirby 1996 cannot be quantitatively compared to our numerical results because the turbulent energy of the model is a depth averaged quantity and includes not only the large scale turbulence but also the depth variation of the mean velocity which means that this turbulent energy includes a non turbulent component whereas the turbulent kinetic energy is measured by ting and kirby 1996 at a specific depth and does not include the variation of the mean velocity in particular there are no experimental measures in the highest part of the flow near the free surface where the turbulent kinetic energy has often its highest values see for example the measures of kimmoun and branger 2007 furthermore the variation with the depth of the mean velocity gives a contribution of the same order of magnitude as the turbulent kinetic energy itself to the depth averaged turbulent energy of the model this explains that our values are higher but qualitatively similar moreover as in the previous test case it should be kept in mind that because of the inaccuracies attached to measurements and experimental set up these comparisons only provide quantitative informations for the model validation we emphasize however that the overall behaviour of turbulent energy seems to be fully consistent with experimental observations 4 3 study of wave set down the purpose of this section is to study in the case of the experiments of bowen et al 1968 the characteristic variations of the mean water level induced by the presence of wave trains and in particular the set down phenomenon corresponding to the characteristic depression of the mean water level observed near the breaking point the calculated set down is governed by the dispersive properties of the model the experiment includes propagation breaking and run up of a train of regular sinusoidal waves several configurations studied by bowen et al 1968 have been studied with different wavelengths and initial amplitudes for instance the experiment with a wavelength of λ 2 02 m a period of t 1 14 s and a deep water wave height of h 0 6 45 cm leads to a computed value of 0 37 cm compared to the still water level whereas the experimental set down was measured by bowen et al 1968 at 0 32 cm similar results were obtained for the other configurations overall the model overestimates the set down effect the calculated mean water level is lower than the measured one by 10 20 approximately this is consistent with what is commonly noticed in other models 4 4 breaking of irregular waves beji and battjes 1993 on the basis of the experimental study of beji and battjes 1993 we now investigate the behaviour of the proposed breaking model in the context of irregular waves beji and battjes conducted a series of experiments implying regular and irregular wave trains propagating over a submerged bar the experimental basin is 37 7 m long 0 8 m wide and is equipped with a trapezoïdal bar extending from x 10 m to x 15 m with 1 20 front and 1 10 back slopes we initially consider a flow at rest with a total depth h 0 0 4 m among the experimental data set available we focus on jonswap type random waves breaking above the bar as spilling breakers corresponding to a peak period t 2 5 s and a characteristic frequency f 0 4 hz the time evolution of the free surface was recorded at eight experimental gauges represented in fig 12 top the signal available at the first wave gauge wg1 x 6 m is used to impose the initial condition at the left boundary note that as in the case of the experiments of beji and battjes 1993 on regular waves richard et al 2019 due to the relatively small nonlinearity of the incident waves involved in this test no breaking criterion is needed here in other terms we use ψ 0 0 according to kazakova and richard 2019 and richard et al 2019 the admissible range for the dimensionless reynolds number is 5 r 10 for waves with a small nonlinearity such that no breaking criterion is used the value r 5 is chosen also numerical results with r 9 5 are also proposed for the sake of completeness comparison between measured and simulated time series of the free surface elevation is proposed at wg2 x 11 m wg5 x 14 m and wg7 x 16 m within the time window 200 s 230 s we observe a very good agreement on all gauges fig 13 in particular the flow experiences a significant increase of enstrophy at the level of the flat part of the bar corresponding to the breaking area identified experimentally fig 12 comparisons with experimental data at wg5 and wg7 given in fig 13 also indicate a good behaviour of the numerical solution at the rear side of the bar able to reproduce correctly the free surface deformations with an accurate estimation of the amplitudes contrary to many models this experiment on irregular waves can be simulated with our model with a good accuracy without any breaking criterion neither for the breaking initiation nor for the breaking termination repartition of the experimental and numerical spectral density with respect to frequency is proposed in fig 14 in which we clearly recognize the first harmonic at f 0 4 hz the present model is also able to capture the second peak frequency at f 0 8 hz even at the last gauges the highest harmonics are damped due to a residual viscosity which is still present after breaking the damping effect is significantly reduced if r is increased from r 5 to r 9 5 because this decreases the viscosity indeed as evidenced by fig 14 setting the viscous terms artificially to zero shortly after breaking reduces almost completely the damping effect on the high frequencies improving the simulation of the free surface in the rapidly varying parts fig 13 more precisely in the case r 9 5 and ν x 14 m 0 we locally set ν t 0 from x 14 m in 16 and 33 even if the free surface elevation is correctly reproduced in all simulations with small differences the nonlinear phenomenon of high frequency generation in the shallow horizontal part above the bar and in the deepening part of the propagation is better simulated with r 9 5 which gives a satisfactory treatment of the nonlinear interactions 5 conclusion in this work the recent model of kazakova and richard 2019 and richard et al 2019 for coastal waves mainly dedicated to solitary waves was supplemented with a turbulent diffusion term and extended to the case of regular and irregular wave trains the model is fully nonlinear and has the same dispersive properties as the green naghdi equations but is also able to account for the large scale turbulence and the depth variations of the mean velocity through a new variable called enstrophy the new diffusive term is useful only for the numerical treatment to smooth the solutions at the breaking point the turbulent dissipation coefficient c r has a universal value 0 48 and needs no calibration in the case of waves with a small nonlinearity as in the experiments of beji and battjes 1993 no breaking criterion is needed and we found that the values in the range given in kazakova and richard 2019 for the turbulent reynolds number can be used preferably at the upper bound to minimize the attenuation of the high frequency harmonics generated near the coast for wave trains with a higher nonlinearity the breaking criterion of kazakova and richard 2019 can be used with the same empirical laws for the turbulent reynolds number and for the breaking threshold except that the values of these two dimensionless quantities should be increased by up to 30 in the case of the wave trains studied in this paper the model includes a term in the energy equation which is called turbulent energy but which includes in a depth averaged sense the large scale turbulence and the non uniformity in the depth of the mean velocity the variations of this turbulent energy in a wave train are qualitatively in agreement with the experimental measures of ting and kirby 1994 on the transport of the turbulent kinetic energy in the case of the spilling breakers with a short wavelength ting and kirby 1996 the turbulent energy is not dissipated within one wave cycle and it is mostly transported seaward since it keeps an important value when the depth averaged velocity is seaward this can be interpreted as the effect of the undertow in the case of the plunging breakers ting and kirby 1995 because of the longer wave period the turbulent energy is dissipated within one wave cycle and keeps significative values only in the part of the wave where the averaged velocity is shoreward giving a shoreward transport of the turbulent energy the simulation of irregular waves over a bar shows that the nonlinear effects due to shoaling breaking propagation in a shallow horizontal part and de shoaling are correctly reproduced including the generation of higher harmonics the model predicts accurately the set up phenomenon but overestimates slightly the set down effect and underestimates the wave amplitude at the breaking point the calculated skewness and asymmetry coefficients are underestimated in the breaking zone but they are in agreement with the experiments in the inner surf zone the deviations in the breaking zone are common to many models including the serre green naghdi models but compared to the switching approach the present model improves significantly the asymmetry coefficient of the breaking waves in the inner surf zone from a numerical point of view the model is more robust than the switching approach because of its low sensitivity to the space discretization parameters and its ability to reach the numerical convergence the predictive ability of the model is interesting since the empirical laws give the values of the one or two variable dimensionless parameters with very little tuning but of course it should be tested in an even wider range of situations before reaching definitive conclusions on this matter this model would be significantly improved if the need for a breaking criterion could be removed in all cases whereas such a criterion is presently needless only in the case of waves with a small nonlinearity credit authorship contribution statement a duran writing validation funding acquisition investigation g l

23988,the model of coastal waves based on the depth averaging of the large eddy simulation equations kazakova and richard 2019 is extended to the case of regular and irregular wave trains to take into account a stronger turbulence the third moment of the horizontal velocity is modelled with a gradient diffusion hypothesis the effect of this new diffusive term is to smooth and regularize the solutions an asymptotically equivalent model including the improvement of the dispersive properties is solved with a discontinuous galerkin numerical scheme the model has a low sensitivity to the space discretization parameters several classical test cases of wave trains are used to validate the model in the shoaling zone the model is similar to the serre green naghdi equations but the inclusion of a variable called enstrophy to take into account the large scale turbulence and the non uniformity of the mean velocity improves the predictive ability in the inner surf zone in particular the turbulent energy of the model is dissipated within one wave cycle and is transported shoreward in the case of waves with a long period whereas in the case of short periods it is mostly transported seaward because its dissipation is far from being complete within one period the case of an irregular wave train propagating over a submerged bar is simulated without any breaking criterion this benchmark test case validates further the model s ability in predicting the nonlinear effects due to shoaling breaking propagation in a shallow horizontal part and in a deeper region keywords breakers shoaling waves wave breaking waves processes on beaches mathematical models 1 introduction modelling accurately coastal waves is of high importance for applications in coastal erosion and morphodynamics or for the prediction and prevention of extreme events such as great storms for practical problems the size of the computation domain and the duration of the phenomena to be simulated are large and the computation time is an issue this motivates the use of phase averaged models which use a statistical description to calculate the evolution of the wave spectrum however thanks to advances in computer performance numerical schemes and parallel computing the phase resolving models become more and more competitive in these models the sea surface is resolved which necessitates a finer grid a higher accuracy is expected but at the cost of a greater computation time the phase resolving models include the non hydrostatic approach where the reynolds averaged navier stokes equations are solved while the non hydrostatic part of the pressure is calculated by solving an elliptic poisson equation stelling and zijlema 2003 ma et al 2012 derakhti et al 2016a considerable efforts have reduced the vertical resolution needed to reproduce accurately wave breaking from a high value of 10 20 layers to a few layers either by using a breaking criterion removing locally the non hydrostatic part of the pressure smit et al 2013 or by a superior numerical treatment using terrain and surface following σ coordinates derakhti et al 2016b these improvements lead to a significantly reduced computational cost in the other phase resolving models traditionally called boussinesq type models the equations of fluid dynamics are averaged over the depth the non hydrostatic part of the pressure is evaluated from the depth and its derivatives which induces third order derivatives in the model and an elliptic step in the numerical resolution reviews on boussinesq type models can be found in brocchini 2013 and kirby 2016 when propagating shoreward the waves steepen in the shoaling zone where the dispersive effects are dominant strictly speaking the boussinesq equations boussinesq 1872 peregrine 1967 are derived with a weak nonlinearity hypothesis the wave amplitude is much smaller than the water depth which entails some discrepancies in shallow water areas fully nonlinear equations were first derived by serre 1953 in the one dimensional 1d case and extended in the two dimensional 2d case by green et al 1974 and green and naghdi 1976 and are called in this paper the serre green naghdi equations fully nonlinear models are more accurate than the boussinesq equations in particular in the final stages of coastal waves propagation where the wave amplitude is no longer small in comparison to the depth wei and kirby 1995 barthélemy 2004 lannes and bonneton 2009 but they are still weakly dispersive because of the shallow water assumption see for example kirby 2016 which implies that their validity is restricted to small depths various techniques were proposed to improve the dispersive properties of these equations and thus to increase their validity domain in particular nwogu 1993 and wei et al 1995 considered the velocity at an arbitrary depth instead of the depth averaged velocity and bonneton et al 2011 lannes and marche 2015 and do carmo et al 2018 derived an asymptotically equivalent system of equations wave breaking and breakers propagation in the surf zone require to model dissipative effects this was achieved by different approaches the roller models are based on the concept of surface roller svendsen 1984 viewed as a volume of water carried by the wave at the wave velocity schäffer et al 1993 madsen et al 1997 this method leads to several developments in particular with the inclusion of the vorticity in the model veeramony and svendsen 2000 briganti et al 2004 musumeci et al 2005 viviano et al 2015 or through diffusive type terms on both the mass and momentum equations cienfuegos et al 2010 this approach requires to calibrate several parameters notably for the breaking criterion and the determination of the roller geometry another strategy is to model turbulence effects in breaking waves by an eddy viscosity heitner and housner 1970 zelt 1991 kennedy et al 2000 in some models an equation for the turbulent kinetic energy is solved to calculate the eddy viscosity nwogu 1996 karambas and tozer 2003 zhang et al 2014 kazolea and ricchiuto 2018 a turbulent viscosity approach assumes a local balance between production and dissipation and an isotropic turbulence the hybrid models with a switching method are another way to take into account the dissipative effects bonneton et al 2011 tonelli and petti 2011 tissier et al 2012 kazolea et al 2014 filippini et al 2016 duran and marche 2017 by removing the dispersive terms the serre green naghdi equations reduce to the saint venant equations which being hyperbolic produce discontinuities in finite time which dissipate energy a breaking criterion is needed to determine when the dispersive terms should be switched off and a breaking termination criterion determines when they should be switched on this method suffers from numerical problems in particular mesh grid sensitivity and non physical oscillations filippini et al 2016 kazolea and ricchiuto 2018 a new approach based on depth averaging the large eddy simulation les equations was proposed by kazakova and richard 2019 in the 1d case and extended to the 2d case by richard et al 2019 in both cases mostly for solitary waves the large scale turbulence is explicitly resolved in a depth averaged sense with its anisotropic properties while the small scale turbulence is modelled through a turbulent viscosity hypothesis while there is some similarity with the eddy viscosity strategy because of the introduction of an eddy viscosity for the small scale turbulence the originality of this approach lies in the anisotropic tensor modelling the large scale turbulence which satisfies a tensor equation there is thus no need to assume neither an approximate balance between the production and the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy nor an isotropic turbulence which is not always satisfied in the large scales the resulting equations have the special hyperbolic structure of teshukov 2007 with additional source terms the goal of the present paper is to validate this approach in the more general case of periodic and random wave trains with a special attention to the turbulence dynamics the dynamics of surf zone turbulence was studied experimentally by ting and kirby 1994 1995 1996 who found that the turbulent kinetic energy is transported seaward under a spilling breaker whereas it is transported landward and dissipated within one wave cycle in the case of a plunging breaker it is interesting to see if the depth averaged les approach predicts a similar behaviour in section 2 the equations of the model of kazakova and richard 2019 are extended to the case of a stronger turbulence which requires modelling the third moment of the horizontal velocity distribution in the vertical direction in section 3 the numerical scheme is presented together with the treatment of wave breaking in section 4 the model is validated by numerical simulations of experiments on wave trains obtained by cox 1995 ting and kirby 1994 and beji and battjes 1993 2 equations of the model 2 1 depth averaging procedure the main idea of the derivation of the model equations is to average over the depth the les equations the details are given in kazakova and richard 2019 and only the main points and the differences from the original derivation are given here only two dimensional flows are considered here which leads to a 1d model details on the derivation of the 2d model are given in richard et al 2019 starting from the navier stokes equations of incompressible fluids with a density ρ and a kinematic viscosity ν a filtering operation decomposes the velocity field v into a filtered component v and a residual component v r i e v v v r the cutoff frequency is in the inertial subrange so that the filtered field includes the energy containing motions the residual stress tensor is modelled with a turbulent viscosity hypothesis contrary to the usual les approach the eddy viscosity of the residual motions denoted by ν t x t is not modelled by the smagorinsky closure but is supposed to be uniform over the depth i e independent of z this simplification is sufficient for a depth averaged model another important result is the equality of the dissipation of the mean residual kinetic energy and its rate of production lilly 1967 the notations are given in fig 1 we denote by g the gravity acceleration h the total water depth h 0 the still water depth b the elevation of the bottom topography over a horizontal datum and z h b denoting by l the wavelength or the order of magnitude of a horizontal length and by h 0 a reference value of the still water depth the equations are derived with an asymptotic method based on the existence of the small parameter 1 μ h 0 l 1 of the shallow water assumption which is also responsible for the weakly dispersive properties of the equations the reynolds number is high so that all terms due to the molecular viscosity are negligible as in theoretical or experimental works svendsen 1987 beji and battjes 1993 cox 1995 antuono and brocchini 2013 and zhang et al 2014 the eddy viscosity is supposed to be of o μ which means that a dimensionless eddy viscosity writes 2 ν t ν t μ h 0 g h 0 note however that the eddy viscosity is here relative only to the small scale turbulence the averaged value of any quantity a over the depth is defined as 3 a 1 h b h b a d z for the depth averaging procedure the horizontal filtered velocity is decomposed as 4 u x z t u x t u x z t where u is the averaged value of u over the depth and u the deviation of the filtered velocity to this average value this deviation includes the large scale turbulence and the depth variations of the mean non turbulent velocity the flow is supposed to be weakly turbulent and weakly sheared as in teshukov 2007 richard and gavrilyuk 2012 and castro and lannes 2014 this means that 5 u o μ β where β 0 the averaging of the momentum equation in the o x direction gives a term u 2 in the flux the dimensionless filtered horizontal velocity is defined by u u g h 0 since by definition u 0 u 2 u 2 μ 2 β u 2 the second central moment is written with the help of the quantity 6 φ 1 h 3 b h b u 2 d z u 2 h 2 which has the same dimension as the square of a vorticity and is called enstrophy note that in the study of turbulent flows the enstrophy has other definitions because the enstrophy is the third variable of the model the two other ones being the fluid depth h and the average velocity u a third equation must be derived to close the system beside the averaged mass and momentum equations this equation can be obtained by averaging over the depth the balance equation for the kinetic energy of the filtered motions the enstrophy appears also in the energy of the model moreover in the energy flux it appears the third moment of the filtered velocity which can be written in dimensionless form with h h h 0 and φ h 0 φ g u 3 u 3 3 μ 2 β h 2 u φ μ 3 β u 3 the third central moment is of o μ 3 β castro and lannes 2014 and kazakova and richard 2019 took β 1 the leading dispersive and viscous terms are of o μ 2 and all terms of o μ 3 are neglected by taking β 1 the third central moment can be consistently neglected in this paper we take 7 0 β 1 so that the turbulence can be stronger and that u 3 must be consistently kept in the model this implies that either an equation for u 3 must be provided as in castro and lannes 2014 or that u 3 must be modelled since highly turbulent flows can be modelled with the weak turbulence or weak shear approximation richard 2013 gavrilyuk et al 2016 it is expected that the influence of u 3 is small the derivation of an equation for this quantity would greatly complicate the model for very little benefit we choose instead to model this quantity with a gradient diffusion hypothesis by analogy with the study of turbulent flows the enstrophy equation can be derived from the depth averaged mass momentum and energy equations because the enstrophy equation is much simpler than the energy equation and since the viscous terms prevent discontinuities from arising the final system which is solved numerically is composed of the mass momentum and enstrophy equations the enstrophy equation can be written 8 h φ t h u φ x 8 ν t h u x 2 2 h ε 1 h 2 x h u 3 this equation differs from the enstrophy equation derived by kazakova and richard 2019 only from the last term with the third central moment the quantity ε is the depth averaged dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy a simple gradient diffusion model is 9 u 3 2 ν t σ h 2 φ x where σ is a turbulent prandtl number which is generally taken equal to 1 in the models of turbulent flows see for example pope 2000 p 371 the enstrophy equation becomes 10 h φ t h u φ x 8 ν t h u x 2 2 h ε 2 h 2 x ν t σ h 3 φ x an even simpler way to model the last term is to write it in a conservative form as 11 h φ t h u φ x 8 ν t h u x 2 2 h ε x 2 ν t σ h φ x since the numerical resolution will show that the effect of this term is negligible for reasonable values of σ i e larger than 0 1 except that it helps to smooth the solutions at the breaking point where there is a sudden increase of enstrophy the main term to be kept is the diffusion term in practice no difference between 10 and 11 has been noticed in the numerical simulations the closure of the model requires expressions for the turbulent viscosity and for the dissipation as in kazakova and richard 2019 these expressions are 12 ν t h 2 φ r where r is a dimensionless quantity which can be interpreted as a reynolds number and 13 ε c r 2 h 2 φ 3 2 where c r is a dimensionless enstrophy dissipation coefficient this expression of the dissipation guarantees the positivity of the enstrophy the equations of the model write 14 h t h u x 0 15 h u t x h u 2 g h 2 2 h 3 φ h 2 h 3 π x 4 r h 3 φ u x g h b x f and 16 h φ t h u φ x 8 h φ r u x 2 c r h φ 3 2 x 2 h 3 φ σ r φ x the notations ḧ π and f refer to 17 h h u x 2 h 2 u x t h u 2 u x 2 18 π h 2 2 d d t u b x and 19 f h b x h 2 d d t u b x where the material derivative is d d t t u x these equations are rewritten in an asymptotically equivalent way firstly to simplify the numerical resolution section 2 2 and secondly to improve the linear dispersive properties section 2 3 2 2 asymptotically equivalent model the model formed by eqs 14 16 presents the difficulty for the numerical resolution to have mixed third order derivatives in space and time in the momentum equation 15 following the ideas of bonneton et al 2011 and lannes and marche 2015 an asymptotically equivalent model is derived with a mathematical structure more suited to the numerical resolution only the main steps of the method are recalled here and we refer to lannes and marche 2015 for the details and justifications the equations are written in dimensionless form with a classical scaling see for example antuono and brocchini 2013 in particular the elevation b of the bottom topography is supposed to be of o h 0 and the characteristic length of its variation in the o x direction is l this implies that b x o μ in dimensionless form the momentum equation 15 can be written kazakova and richard 2019 20 h u t x h u 2 h 2 2 μ 2 β h 3 φ μ 2 h 2 h 3 μ 2 π μ 2 x 4 r h 3 φ u x h b x μ 2 f in this equation and thereafter to lighten the notations the same symbols are used for the dimensionless quantities the second derivative 17 is rewritten 21 h 2 h 3 h 3 3 x 1 h h u t h u 2 x 2 3 h 3 u x 2 the terms involving the bottom topography b are reorganized to separate the terms including the material derivative d u d t which necessitates a special treatment and the other terms the momentum equation 15 can then be rewritten 22 i μ 2 t h u t h u 2 x h h b x μ 2 β h 3 φ x μ 2 h q 1 μ 2 2 x h 2 b x d u d t μ 2 h 2 2 b x x d u d t μ 2 h b x 2 d u d t μ 2 x 4 r h 3 φ u x o μ 2 β where i is the operator identity t is the operator defined for any quantity w by 23 t w 1 3 x h 3 x w h and 24 h q 1 x 2 3 h 3 u x 2 x h 2 2 u 2 2 b x 2 h 2 b x u x 2 h u 2 b x 2 b x 2 the operator t corresponds to the first term at the right hand side of 21 whereas the quantity q 1 gathers the terms corresponding to the last term of 21 and all topographic terms which do not include the material derivative d u d t from 22 it is possible to write this material derivative 25 d u d t h b x o μ 2 β it is then possible to rewrite consistently 22 with the same precision 26 i μ 2 t h u t h u 2 x h h

first proposed by bonneton et al 2011 the advantage of this method is that the system can be solved without any third order derivative however this operator is time dependent which makes its inversion time consuming the final step is the constant method which introduces a time independent operator by using the following asymptotically equivalent equation lannes and marche 2015 28 i μ 2 t h u t h u 2 x h h b x μ 2 β h 3 φ x μ 2 h q 1 q 2 q 3 μ 2 x 4 r h 3 φ u x o μ 2 β where the time independent operator t is defined for any quantity w by 29 t w 1 3 x h 0 3 x w h 0 and 30 q 3 s i μ 2 t 1 h h b x where the operator s is defined for any quantity w by 31 s w 1 6 h 2 h 0 2 x w x 1 3 h 2 h 0 2 2 w x 2 1 6 2 h 2 h 0 2 x 2 w the operator i μ 2 t is inverted only once at the beginning of the numerical resolution using the still water depth this method decreases markedly the computation time and is efficient and robust lannes and marche 2015 2 3 optimization of the dispersive properties the serre green naghdi equations are weakly dispersive their dispersive properties are accurate while the depth is not too large more precisely until k h 0 1 chazel et al 2011 where k is the wavenumber for practical applications a larger validity domain is often required which implies to use an optimization technique the optimization procedure of bonneton et al 2011 can be easily adapted to this system an asymptotically equivalent system is derived once again using 25 it is then possible to write 32 μ 2 t h u t h u 2 x μ 2 α t h u t h u 2 x μ 2 α 1 t h h b x o μ 2 2 β where α 1 this gives the following asymptotically equivalent system with improved dispersive properties 33 i μ 2 α t h u t h u 2 x α 1 α h h b x 1 α h h b x μ 2 β h 3 φ x μ 2 h q 1 q 2 q 3 μ 2 x 4 r h 3 φ u x o μ 2 β together with the mass equation 14 and the enstrophy equation 16 the optimal value of α is bonneton et al 2011 34 α 1 159 with this value the phase velocity is accurate until k h 0 4 5 the group velocity until k h 0 2 5 and the shoaling coefficient until k h 0 2 bonneton et al 2011 chazel et al 2011 3 numerical aspects neglecting the o μ 2 β residuals in 33 and going back to variables with dimensions the final set of equations completed with 14 and 16 is discretized on the basis of the discontinuous galerkin scheme proposed by duran and marche 2015 originally designed for the 1d serre green naghdi equations from a numerical viewpoint the extension to the present model consists in a slight modification of the momentum equation and the addition of a transport equation in the discrete formulation as concerns the enstrophy transport the conservative terms are treated in the hyperbolic stage corresponding to the left hand side of 16 while the terms appearing in the right hand side production dissipation and diffusion are computed using a classical collocation method with direct nodal products in the same way as those of the momentum equations overall the adaptation of the scheme can be done without particular technical difficulties and the reader is referred to duran and marche 2015 for implementation details and richard et al 2019 for a 2d extension including enstrophy in the 2d case note however that the presence of viscous terms in the model through 16 and 33 constrains the time step to a parabolic stability condition in practice and especially close to mesh convergence this may entail drastic restrictions on the time step in our simulations we slightly decreased the theoretical cfl hyperbolic condition to take this into account which has been sufficient to ensure stable computations for the considered values of σ ideally these terms should be implicited to get rid of this restriction this task is part of a work currently in progress to improve the global computational efficiency of the scheme as regards the numerical treatment of boundary conditions the generation and absorption of waves are based on classical relaxation techniques see chazel et al 2011 duran and marche 2015 lannes and marche 2015 madsen et al 2003 wei and kirby 1995 allowing to progressively transit from an imposed analytical profile to the numerical solution the computational domain is extended at the inlet boundary and outlet when necessary to include the sponge layers generally calibrated from the wavelength of incoming waves as regards the wave breaking treatment we follow the strategy proposed by kazakova and richard 2019 as reported in this work injecting enstrophy at the very beginning of the computations may have an impact on the amplitude of the waves even outside breaking areas to prevent this the idea is to turn on viscous creation terms in the enstrophy equation only when needed to achieve this a breaking criterion is used relying on the concept of virtual enstrophy denoted ψ in the sequel this new quantity satisfies a second transport equation introduced to evaluate the amount of enstrophy that the model is able to produce but without retroaction on the physical flow variables put in other words the virtual enstrophy is computed exactly as the enstrophy with viscous terms evaluated in the whole computational domain wave breaking can then be characterized by a sudden growth of virtual enstrophy in practice breaking areas are identified as those for which ψ ψ 0 with ψ 0 a threshold to be defined resulting in a local activation of the viscous terms in the effective enstrophy equation it should be noted however that the use of such a tool is unnecessary for simulations implying small relative amplitudes following kazakova and richard 2019 the trigger threshold is thus defined as 35 ψ 0 ψ 0 s g h 0 0 1 0 031 h 0 a if a h 0 0 05 0 otherwise with h 0 the still water depth at the initial position of the wave and a the initial amplitude of the wave regarding the other parameters of the model the dimensionless reynolds number is given by 36 r r 0 0 85 60 s s being the bed slope and the dissipation coefficient present in 16 has the universal value c r 0 48 the eddy viscosity can be written 37 ν t b h 2 φ r with b 0 where ψ ψ 0 and b 1 elsewhere note that these choices proved to be relevant in a large variety of 1d and 2d applications implying solitary waves propagating over non trivial topographies see kazakova and richard 2019 richard et al 2019 thus conferring a predictive character to the model the main purpose of the present work is to investigate its applicability to wave trains as will be seen through the next examples although being almost immediate some specific aspects must be taken into account the main reason is that the enstrophy produced by a single wave is not always dissipated during one period and may be partially recovered by the following ones this can lead to an accumulation phenomenon at the level of the breaking point resulting in a slight underestimation of the wave s amplitude note that these observations are in accordance with the complex turbulent interactions induced by wave trains reported in experimental works see for instance ting and kirby 1994 we shall see that a small increase of the reynolds number or the breaking threshold is sufficient to remedy this problem 4 model validation 4 1 cox s experiment cox 1995 the first test we consider is based on the experimental study carried out by cox 1995 and implies a regular train of cnoidal waves with relative amplitude a h 0 0 29 and period t 2 2 s propagating in a wave flume with a constant bed slope 1 35 the still water level h 0 in the constant depth section of the channel is h 0 0 4 m in this context as the waves approach the shore they start shoaling under the effect of the topography steepen and experience breaking of spilling type the objective is therefore to evaluate the capacity of the present model to faithfully reproduce these characteristics the computational domain is 0 24 and includes a sponge layer of 5 m at the left boundary to allow a proper generation of incident waves the topography is parametrized as follows 38 z x max 0 x 6 35 the time evolution of the free surface was recorded at six wave gauges located at x 10 6 m x 13 m x 14 2 m x 15 4 m x 16 6 m and x 17 8 m as indicated in fig 2 top note that the present configuration leads to ψ 0 ψ 0 s 5 07 s 2 for the breaking threshold as can be seen in fig 2 middle this limit value is reached around x 13 m between wg2 and wg3 which marks the beginning of the breaking area this is in accordance with the experiments and other numerical results tissier et al 2012 from this point we clearly see local entropy peaks follow the breaking of the waves until the shore as noted above looking at virtual and effective enstrophy fig 2 middle and bottom we also observe that the turbulent energy of the model h 2 φ 2 has no time to completely dissipate between two successive waves which is in accordance with the results found by ting and kirby 1994 and ting and kirby 1996 on spilling type breaking part of this energy is thus reintroduced in the train with the effect of slightly decreasing the wave s amplitude as mentioned one possibility is to increase the reynolds number to balance this residual turbulent energy in the presented results it is fixed to r 1 2 r 0 3 08 where r 0 is the reynolds number given by 36 comparison with experimental time series of the free surface is available in fig 3 together with numerical results obtained with a classical switching strategy we observe an overall good agreement especially for the three last gauges where the present model seems in better agreement with structural aspects of the wave in particular breaking waves treated as shock with the switching method tend to present steeper fronts notably at gauge wg4 and wg5 where the present model gives a more accurate profile for both strategies we also notice an underestimation of the wave height at the breaking point which is characteristic of the serre green naghdi solutions these observations are supported by fig 4 giving the spatial distribution of the amplitudes and mean value of the free surface top wave skewness s k middle and wave asymmetry a s bottom these two last quantities are computed as follows kennedy et al 2000 39 s k η η 3 η η 2 3 2 40 a s h η η 3 η η 2 3 2 where h stands for the hilbert transform η is the mean elevation and x is the time averaged value of any quantity x both models are in agreement with the experiments in the shoaling zone before 12 m there are some discrepancies in the breaking zone around 13 14 m since no depth averaged model can describe accurately the breaking process and because the serre green naghdi equations tend to predict waves less peaked than observed waves and thus with a lower skewness in the inner surf zone after 15 m the present model improves significantly the skewness factor and the asymmetry factor compared to the switching model the switching approach underestimates the skewness in the inner surf zone and overestimates markedly the asymmetry since the switching model treats the front of breaking waves as a shock the predicted asymmetry should be much higher than the experimental values the numerical viscosity can decrease somewhat this discrepancy resulting in a deterioration of the solution with mesh refinement in the case of the switching model the calculated mean water level mwl is in agreement with the experiments including the small set down effect and the set up effect the crest and trough elevations relative to the mean water level are also correctly reproduced except as noted above the crest elevation at the breaking point gauges wg2 and wg3 numerical convergence was reached with a space step of δ x 0 02 m a fundamental advantage of the present approach over switching type strategies relies on its low sensitivity with respect to the space discretization parameters indeed very similar results were obtained at higher orders and for more important mesh resolutions reversely switching strategies are less robust since a modification of the space step may entail significant variations of the numerical results and require a new calibration of the breaking parameters see tissier et al 2012 kazolea and ricchiuto 2018 the phenomenon is illustrated in fig 5 which compares our results to those obtained with a switching method for different mesh grids for a given set of breaking parameters we clearly see that numerical convergence is reached with a space step of δ x 0 02 m for the present strategy while for the switching the behaviour of the solution is highly dependent of the mesh size and suggests a systematic readjustment of the parameter set furthermore in the case of the switching model spurious oscillations appear with mesh refinement and these numerical instabilities increase if the cells become thinner which prevents mesh convergence this problem does not take place with our model finally fig 6 reveals the numerical interest of the diffusion term indeed when σ the brutal variations of enstrophy at the level of the breaking zone generate free surface perturbations that propagate offshore and pollute the numerical solution this prevents notably the establishment of a permanent regime a small amount of diffusion on the enstrophy has the effect of damping these strong variations and is sufficient to overcome the problem 4 2 ting and kirby s experiment ting and kirby 1994 based on the same experimental set up ting and kirby 1994 and ting and kirby 1995 conducted a series of works dedicated to the study of breaking wave trains of spilling and plunging type we first focus on the spilling breaker case corresponding to a wave period t 2 s and an amplitude a 0 125 m computations are run on the interval 0 40 and we consider the following topography 41 z x max 0 x 10 35 based on the empirical laws 35 36 the optimal choice for the breaking constants is r 1 3 r 0 3 3 and ψ 0 1 3 ψ 0 s 6 3 s 2 where ψ 0 s is the value given by 35 which are almost the same values as for cox s experiments the numerical results were obtained for a mesh size δ x 0 04 m comparisons between measured and simulated time series of the free surface elevation at several wave gauges located along the domain are available in fig 7 we can observe an overall good agreement except at the breaking point around 27 28 m where the waves have a smaller amplitude and are wider and less peaked we also note that the wave characteristics are particularly well reproduced in the inner surf zone after 28 m in particular we recover the expected amplitudes and observe a faithful reproduction of the steepness profiles these observations are confirmed by the skewness and asymmetry calculations available in fig 8 middle and bottom respectively in particular the estimation of the asymmetry indicators marks a noticeable improvement when compared to switching type strategies tissier et al 2012 surface elevation profiles including wave crest wave trough and mean elevation are given in fig 8 top exhibiting a good agreement with the experiment in line with other works available in the literature see cienfuegos et al 2010 lynett 2006 tissier et al 2012 the skewness coefficient is too small in the breaking zone because the waves are wider and lower but is correctly estimated in the inner surf zone the mean water level presents a noticeable set down effect at 28 m which was not measured in the experiments and a set up effect in accordance with the measured values the crest and trough elevations relative to the mean water level are in agreement with the experiments except for a lower crest elevation at the breaking point the ability of the model to describe the evolution of the turbulent energy can be assessed through fig 9 the time series of the dimensionless turbulent energy are presented as well as the dimensionless velocity at three wave gauges located in the inner surf zone as in the previous case the amount of enstrophy produced by the mechanism of breaking is not dissipated during one period a large proportion is still present in time windows associated with a negative velocity which means that a substantial part of the turbulent energy is carried offshore this result is qualitatively in accordance with ting and kirby 1994 who found that the turbulent kinetic energy is transported seaward under the spilling breaker keeping the same discretization parameters we now turn to the case of the plunging breaker studied by ting and kirby 1995 the period is t 5 s and the amplitude is a 0 128 m the optimal parameters of the model are r 1 2 r 0 3 1 and ψ 0 1 1 ψ 0 s 5 3 s 2 the distributions of wave amplitudes and mean water level given in fig 10 are well reproduced when comparing to experimental results of ting and kirby 1994 as for the spilling breaker case a small set down effect is noticeable in the mean water level curve which was not measured in the experiments the set up at the end of the inner surf zone is in agreement with the measures the calculated crest and trough elevations are very close to the experimental results even the maximum value of the crest elevation at the breaking point which is similar to the experimental value the results available in fig 11 highlight a notable difference with spilling breakers at the level of the breaking point we note that the turbulent energy produced by a single wave has time to dissipate almost completely before the following wave so that each wave is handled independently by its own enstrophy production as a result the amount of turbulent energy carried offshore is very low marking a sharp distinction with respect to spilling breakers the turbulent energy of the model is very small when the averaged velocity is negative seaward which means that the overall turbulent energy transport is shoreward this is in agreement with the result of ting and kirby 1994 who noted that in the case of the plunging breaker the turbulent kinetic energy is transported landward and that it is dissipated within one wave cycle the model is thus able to predict the variations of the turbulent energy and the direction of its transport and to distinguish between the case of a short wave period such as the spilling breaker with t 2 s of ting and kirby 1996 where the turbulent energy is not dissipated within one wave cycle resulting in a seaward transport and the case of a longer wave period as the case of the plunging breaker with t 5 s of ting and kirby 1995 where the turbulent energy is dissipated in one period and transported landward note that the measurements of the turbulent kinetic energy of ting and kirby 1995 and ting and kirby 1996 cannot be quantitatively compared to our numerical results because the turbulent energy of the model is a depth averaged quantity and includes not only the large scale turbulence but also the depth variation of the mean velocity which means that this turbulent energy includes a non turbulent component whereas the turbulent kinetic energy is measured by ting and kirby 1996 at a specific depth and does not include the variation of the mean velocity in particular there are no experimental measures in the highest part of the flow near the free surface where the turbulent kinetic energy has often its highest values see for example the measures of kimmoun and branger 2007 furthermore the variation with the depth of the mean velocity gives a contribution of the same order of magnitude as the turbulent kinetic energy itself to the depth averaged turbulent energy of the model this explains that our values are higher but qualitatively similar moreover as in the previous test case it should be kept in mind that because of the inaccuracies attached to measurements and experimental set up these comparisons only provide quantitative informations for the model validation we emphasize however that the overall behaviour of turbulent energy seems to be fully consistent with experimental observations 4 3 study of wave set down the purpose of this section is to study in the case of the experiments of bowen et al 1968 the characteristic variations of the mean water level induced by the presence of wave trains and in particular the set down phenomenon corresponding to the characteristic depression of the mean water level observed near the breaking point the calculated set down is governed by the dispersive properties of the model the experiment includes propagation breaking and run up of a train of regular sinusoidal waves several configurations studied by bowen et al 1968 have been studied with different wavelengths and initial amplitudes for instance the experiment with a wavelength of λ 2 02 m a period of t 1 14 s and a deep water wave height of h 0 6 45 cm leads to a computed value of 0 37 cm compared to the still water level whereas the experimental set down was measured by bowen et al 1968 at 0 32 cm similar results were obtained for the other configurations overall the model overestimates the set down effect the calculated mean water level is lower than the measured one by 10 20 approximately this is consistent with what is commonly noticed in other models 4 4 breaking of irregular waves beji and battjes 1993 on the basis of the experimental study of beji and battjes 1993 we now investigate the behaviour of the proposed breaking model in the context of irregular waves beji and battjes conducted a series of experiments implying regular and irregular wave trains propagating over a submerged bar the experimental basin is 37 7 m long 0 8 m wide and is equipped with a trapezoïdal bar extending from x 10 m to x 15 m with 1 20 front and 1 10 back slopes we initially consider a flow at rest with a total depth h 0 0 4 m among the experimental data set available we focus on jonswap type random waves breaking above the bar as spilling breakers corresponding to a peak period t 2 5 s and a characteristic frequency f 0 4 hz the time evolution of the free surface was recorded at eight experimental gauges represented in fig 12 top the signal available at the first wave gauge wg1 x 6 m is used to impose the initial condition at the left boundary note that as in the case of the experiments of beji and battjes 1993 on regular waves richard et al 2019 due to the relatively small nonlinearity of the incident waves involved in this test no breaking criterion is needed here in other terms we use ψ 0 0 according to kazakova and richard 2019 and richard et al 2019 the admissible range for the dimensionless reynolds number is 5 r 10 for waves with a small nonlinearity such that no breaking criterion is used the value r 5 is chosen also numerical results with r 9 5 are also proposed for the sake of completeness comparison between measured and simulated time series of the free surface elevation is proposed at wg2 x 11 m wg5 x 14 m and wg7 x 16 m within the time window 200 s 230 s we observe a very good agreement on all gauges fig 13 in particular the flow experiences a significant increase of enstrophy at the level of the flat part of the bar corresponding to the breaking area identified experimentally fig 12 comparisons with experimental data at wg5 and wg7 given in fig 13 also indicate a good behaviour of the numerical solution at the rear side of the bar able to reproduce correctly the free surface deformations with an accurate estimation of the amplitudes contrary to many models this experiment on irregular waves can be simulated with our model with a good accuracy without any breaking criterion neither for the breaking initiation nor for the breaking termination repartition of the experimental and numerical spectral density with respect to frequency is proposed in fig 14 in which we clearly recognize the first harmonic at f 0 4 hz the present model is also able to capture the second peak frequency at f 0 8 hz even at the last gauges the highest harmonics are damped due to a residual viscosity which is still present after breaking the damping effect is significantly reduced if r is increased from r 5 to r 9 5 because this decreases the viscosity indeed as evidenced by fig 14 setting the viscous terms artificially to zero shortly after breaking reduces almost completely the damping effect on the high frequencies improving the simulation of the free surface in the rapidly varying parts fig 13 more precisely in the case r 9 5 and ν x 14 m 0 we locally set ν t 0 from x 14 m in 16 and 33 even if the free surface elevation is correctly reproduced in all simulations with small differences the nonlinear phenomenon of high frequency generation in the shallow horizontal part above the bar and in the deepening part of the propagation is better simulated with r 9 5 which gives a satisfactory treatment of the nonlinear interactions 5 conclusion in this work the recent model of kazakova and richard 2019 and richard et al 2019 for coastal waves mainly dedicated to solitary waves was supplemented with a turbulent diffusion term and extended to the case of regular and irregular wave trains the model is fully nonlinear and has the same dispersive properties as the green naghdi equations but is also able to account for the large scale turbulence and the depth variations of the mean velocity through a new variable called enstrophy the new diffusive term is useful only for the numerical treatment to smooth the solutions at the breaking point the turbulent dissipation coefficient c r has a universal value 0 48 and needs no calibration in the case of waves with a small nonlinearity as in the experiments of beji and battjes 1993 no breaking criterion is needed and we found that the values in the range given in kazakova and richard 2019 for the turbulent reynolds number can be used preferably at the upper bound to minimize the attenuation of the high frequency harmonics generated near the coast for wave trains with a higher nonlinearity the breaking criterion of kazakova and richard 2019 can be used with the same empirical laws for the turbulent reynolds number and for the breaking threshold except that the values of these two dimensionless quantities should be increased by up to 30 in the case of the wave trains studied in this paper the model includes a term in the energy equation which is called turbulent energy but which includes in a depth averaged sense the large scale turbulence and the non uniformity in the depth of the mean velocity the variations of this turbulent energy in a wave train are qualitatively in agreement with the experimental measures of ting and kirby 1994 on the transport of the turbulent kinetic energy in the case of the spilling breakers with a short wavelength ting and kirby 1996 the turbulent energy is not dissipated within one wave cycle and it is mostly transported seaward since it keeps an important value when the depth averaged velocity is seaward this can be interpreted as the effect of the undertow in the case of the plunging breakers ting and kirby 1995 because of the longer wave period the turbulent energy is dissipated within one wave cycle and keeps significative values only in the part of the wave where the averaged velocity is shoreward giving a shoreward transport of the turbulent energy the simulation of irregular waves over a bar shows that the nonlinear effects due to shoaling breaking propagation in a shallow horizontal part and de shoaling are correctly reproduced including the generation of higher harmonics the model predicts accurately the set up phenomenon but overestimates slightly the set down effect and underestimates the wave amplitude at the breaking point the calculated skewness and asymmetry coefficients are underestimated in the breaking zone but they are in agreement with the experiments in the inner surf zone the deviations in the breaking zone are common to many models including the serre green naghdi models but compared to the switching approach the present model improves significantly the asymmetry coefficient of the breaking waves in the inner surf zone from a numerical point of view the model is more robust than the switching approach because of its low sensitivity to the space discretization parameters and its ability to reach the numerical convergence the predictive ability of the model is interesting since the empirical laws give the values of the one or two variable dimensionless parameters with very little tuning but of course it should be tested in an even wider range of situations before reaching definitive conclusions on this matter this model would be significantly improved if the need for a breaking criterion could be removed in all cases whereas such a criterion is presently needless only in the case of waves with a small nonlinearity credit authorship contribution statement a duran writing validation funding acquisition investigation g l

23989,baroclinic eddy restratification strongly influences the ocean s general circulation and tracer budgets and has been routinely parameterized via the gent mcwilliams gm scheme in coarse resolution ocean climate models these parameterizations have been improved via refinements of the gm eddy transfer coefficient using eddy resolving simulations and theoretical developments however previous efforts have focused primarily on the open ocean and the applicability of existing gm parameterization approaches to continental slopes remains to be addressed in this study we use a suite of eddy resolving process oriented simulations to test scaling relationships between eddy buoyancy diffusivity mean flow properties and topographic geometries in simulations of baroclinic turbulence over continental slopes we focus on the case of retrograde i e opposing the direction of topographic wave propagation winds a configuration that arises commonly around the margins of the subtropical gyres three types of scalings are examined namely the geometric framework developed by marshall et al 2012 a new cross front cf scaling derived via dimensional arguments and the mixing length theory mlt based scalings tested recently by jansen et al 2015 over a flat ocean bed the present study emphasizes the crucial role of the local slope parameter defined as the ratio between the topographic slope and the depth averaged isopycnal slope in controlling the nonlinear eddy buoyancy fluxes both the geometric framework and the cf scaling can reproduce the depth averaged eddy buoyancy transfer across alongshore uniform continental slopes for suitably chosen constant prefactors generalization of these scalings across both continental slope and open ocean environments requires the introduction of prefactors that depend on the local slope parameter via empirically derived analytical functions in contrast the mlt based scalings fail to quantify the eddy buoyancy transfer across alongshore uniform continental slopes when constant prefactors are adopted but can reproduce the cross slope eddy flux when the prefactors are adapted via empirical functions of the local slope parameter application of these scalings in prognostic ocean simulations also depends on an accurate representation of standing eddies associated with the topographic corrugations of the continental slope these findings offer a basis for extending existing approaches to parameterizing transient eddies and call for future efforts to parameterize standing eddies in coarse resolution ocean climate models

power have allowed global ocean models to be run with a horizontal grid spacing as fine as 0 1 e g uchida et al 2017 resolving mesoscale at low and mid latitudes in the open ocean however even with such a fine resolution mesoscale eddies cannot be resolved over continental slopes hallberg 2013 the rapid decrease of the ocean depth leads to a decrease of the rossby deformation radius and thus finer scales of unstable baroclinic modes compared to those in the open ocean in addition recent studies have revealed that baroclinic modes tend to be surface intensified over steep topography lacasce 2017 and require high vertical resolution to simulate in ocean models cast in geopotential coordinates e g stewart et al 2017 numerical experiments of freely evolving and wind driven baroclinic turbulence over topography point towards a bottom intensified eddy energy sink due to topographic rectification even in the absence of tides merryfield and holloway 1999 venaille 2012 wang and stewart 2018 ws18 hereafter indicating that eddy effects at the surface substantially differ from those near the sloping bottom e g lacasce 1998 lacasce and brink 2000 this invites the question to what extent do existing eddy parameterizations adopted by today s ocean climate models capture eddy behaviors over continental slopes the most widely used approach to parameterizing mesoscale eddies in coarse resolution ocean climate models is a combination of the gent and mcwilliams 1990 gm hereafter scheme which works to flatten isopycnals and release potential energy and the redi 1982 scheme which serves to flux tracers downgradient along isopycnals this approach hinges upon the prescription of the gm and redi eddy transfer coefficients which measure the strengths of adiabatic buoyancy and isopycnal mixing by transient eddies respectively depending on the large scale explicitly resolved flow properties in the quasi geostrophic qg ocean interior the gm transfer coefficient can be approximately related to the redi transfer coefficient abernathey et al 2013 therefore accurate construction of the former may shed light on the latter various schemes have been proposed to construct the gm eddy transfer coefficient using properties of the resolved flow for instance the mixing length theory mlt hereafter prandtl 1925 paradigm formulates the gm transfer coefficient as the product of an eddy length scale and a characteristic eddy velocity or equivalently the product of an inverse eddy time scale and the squared eddy length scale multiplied by a non dimensional prefactor coefficient e g green 1970 stone 1972 visbeck et al 1997 eden and greatbatch 2008 cessi 2008 jansen et al 2015 other formulations have been derived from mathematical constraints on the eddy stress

parcel motions fox kemper et al 2008 although these approaches have achieved increasing fidelity in their representation of eddy restratification and transport in the open ocean griffies 2004 they are not necessarily transferable to continental slopes previous studies of cross slope eddy buoyancy transfer have relied principally on the modified qg eady 1949 or phillips 1954 models which predict that the ratio between the bottom slope and the isopycnal slope denoted by the slope parameter δ determines the stability of along slope flows blumsack and gierasch 1972 mechoso 1980 spall 2004 isachsen 2011 pennel et al 2012 poulin et al 2014 hetland 2017 lacasce et al 2019 manucharyan and isachsen 2019 specifically for δ 0 corresponding to prograde i e in the same direction as the topographic wave propagation flows both the wavelengths and the growth rates of unstable waves decrease as the magnitude of δ increases by contrast for δ 0 corresponding to retrograde i e opposite to the direction of topographic wave propagation flows the linear growth rate instead increases but then drops to zero for δ 1 the linear prediction has proved to be qualitatively useful in interpreting the nonlinear eddy buoyancy transfer in prograde fronts via primitive equation simulations and laboratory experiments spall 2004 isachsen 2011 pennel et al 2012 poulin et al 2014 ghaffari et al 2018 this contrasts with retrograde flows in which the nonlinear eddy mixing persists ws18 manucharyan and isachsen 2019 and may even be enhanced when δ exceeds 1 e g isachsen 2011 stewart and thompson 2013 a theoretical basis for interpreting the variation of nonlinear eddy buoyancy flux with the slope parameter in retrograde fronts remains elusive isachsen 2011 most of the aforementioned studies have also chosen to neglect the influence of topographic canyons ridges on eddy buoyancy transfer across continental slopes however this choice carries certain caveats because topographic canyons ridges were found to be ubiquitous along realistic continental margins see fig 5 of harris and whiteway 2011 for a global distribution of submarine canyons a number of studies have revealed that topographic canyons ridges can substantially enhance the onshore intrusions of mass and physical biogeochemical properties in retrograde slope fronts e g kämpf 2007 allen and hickey 2010 which are directly linked to the arrested topographically trapped waves over canyons ridges zhang and lentz 2017 2018 a paradigm for constructing the gm based eddy transfer coefficient that accounts for the effects of the bottom slope is yet to be developed such a paradigm should incorporate the aforementioned nonlinear eddy characteristics over continental slopes particularly in retrograde fronts where linear predictions proved to be ineffective this article serves as a first step to fill this crucial gap by constructing multiple slope aware and numerically implementable scalings of the depth averaged cross slope eddy buoyancy mixing focusing on the case of flows driven by retrograde wind forcing in the limit of a flat ocean bed most scalings reduce to the formulations that have been tested in previous studies consistent with the findings of harris and whiteway 2011 we also investigate to what extent topographic canyons ridges may impact the proposed scalings for transient eddy buoyancy fluxes the rest of this article is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the model configurations employed in this study compare the key characteristics of wind driven flows over an alongshore uniform slope and over a corrugated slope and highlight the quantitative influence of topographic corrugation on eddy buoyancy transfer in section 3 we propose the scalings for the depth averaged eddy buoyancy mixing across alongshore uniform continental slopes in section 4 we assess the transferability of these scalings to alongshore corrugated slopes discussion and conclusion follow in section 5 2 numerical simulations in this section we describe the model configuration of our simulations illustrate the simulated flow characters and quantify the cross slope eddy buoyancy fluxes all experiments use the mit general circulation model mitgcm hereafter marshall et al 1997 the quantitative performance of which in simulating continental shelf slope eddies has been evaluated in ws18 against an isopycnal coordinate model and a terrain following coordinate model 2 1 reference model configuration the configuration of our reference simulation follows that of ws18 the most salient details of which are reiterated here with reference physical parameters summarized in table 1 we consider a zonal channel with a continental shelf of 500 m depth located at the southern boundary of the domain the shelf is deeper than most realistic continental shelves e g cacchione et al 2002 to ensure that the flow field over the shelf and slope is adequately resolved the ocean depth is 4000 m at the northern boundary and shoals from the center of the domain toward the shelf across an idealized continental slope specifically the bathymetry z h x y is defined by 1 h x y z s 1 2 h s tanh y y s y t sin 2 π x λ t w s where x l x 2 l x 2 is the along slope distance longitude from the domain center y 0 l y is the offshore distance latitude z s 2250 m denotes the slope mid depth h s 3500 m represents the shelf height and w s 50 km is the slope half width the latitude of the center of the continental slope varies longitudinally see fig 1 with mean position y s 200 km wavelength λ t and onshore offshore excursion amplitude y t the channel spans 800 km and 500 km in the along slope and cross slope directions respectively throughout this work we will use along slope and longitudinal or zonal interchangeably and similarly for the cross slope with latitudinal or meridional the channel is posed on an f plane with a coriolis parameter f 0 1 1 0 4 s 1 as changes in depth dominate the background pv gradient and so the slope can be thought of as being oriented in any direction relative to meridians we use a horizontal grid spacing of 2 km and 70 vertical levels with vertical grid spacing increasing from 10 m at the surface to over 100 m at the ocean bed partial grid cells with a minimum non dimensional fraction of 0 1 are used to improve representation of flows over the continental slope griffies et al 2000 simulations conducted at higher 1 km horizontal grid resolution or based on 133 vertical levels yielded no qualitative differences from the results reported below the channel is forced at the surface by a steady alongshore wind stress with a cross shore profile defined by 2 τ x τ o sin 2 y l w 0 y l w here τ o 0 05 n m 2 denotes the maximum strength of wind which coincides with the mean offshore slope position y s 200 km l w 400 km measures for the width of forcing in the offshore direction and the negative sign on the right hand side of 2 corresponds to retrograde i e westward wind stress no surface buoyancy flux is prescribed at the ocean bed the channel is subject to a drag stress with quadratic coefficient c d 2 5 1 0 3 serving as a sink for energy and momentum imparted by the surface wind stress periodic boundary conditions are used in the alongshore direction no normal flow conditions are imposed at the shoreward and offshore edges of the domain the potential temperature is restored to a reference exponential profile across a sponge layer of 50 km width at the northern boundary with a maximum relaxation time scale of 7 days to facilitate the evolution of ocean flow into a statistically steady state this effectively fixes the first baroclinic rossby deformation radius 3 l d h 0 n s d z π f 0 at approximately 18 km in the deep open ocean where n s is the buoyancy frequency the surface k profile parameterization kpp large et al 1994 is used with its default setting for the reference simulation because almost no difference is yielded by replacing the kpp with a large diffusivity of 100 m 2 s for parameterizing convective instabilities all subsequent experiments follow the latter option for computational efficiency in addition an explicit biharmonic viscosity is used for numerical stability 2 2 experiments a suite of experiments are performed by varying the reference settings in section 2 1 specifically we independently adjust the maximum strength of wind the thermal expansion coefficient and importantly the slope geometry for each simulation which are summarized in table 2 we vary these dimensional parameters in such a way as to cover a wide range of continental slope configurations characterized by five non dimensional numbers discussed below and meanwhile avoid redundant runs the wind stress magnitude is quantified by a rossby number defined as 4 r τ τ 0 ρ 0 f 0 2 l w h which is varied between 1 56 1 0 6 and 6 25 1 0 6 corresponding to a wind driven overturning with its strength ranging from 0 25 m 2 s to 1 00 m 2 s per unit channel width and thus resembling those across the margins of mid latitude gyres e g colas et al 2013 and high latitude marginal seas e g manucharyan and isachsen 2019 the stratification off the shelf slope is quantified via the non dimensionalized buoyancy frequency 5 n h 0 n s y l y d z π f 0 h where n s y l y denotes the vertical buoyancy frequency at the northern boundary the first baroclinic rossby deformation radius determined by 5 measures from 12 km through 25 km mimicking the near slope ocean condition at mid high latitudes see e g figs 6 and 8 of chelton et al 1998 the slope steepness is measured by 6 s t h s 2 w s which is varied between 1 75 1 0 2 and 7 00 1 0 2 corresponding to a topographic slope angle ranging from 1 to 4 in the meridional direction consistent with typical slope steepnesses in the ocean e g cacchione et al 2002 the corrugation or roughness of the sloping ocean bed is quantified by the non dimensional alongshore bathymetric wavelength 7 λ 0 λ t 2 w s y t and the depth variation of the slope 8 ϒ max h m min h m h where h m is the height of ocean bed at the mean mid slope position y y s similar parameters to 4 and 8 are defined by brink 2010 to study tidal rectification over continental shelves and slopes in a barotropic ocean the simulations in table 2 are categorized into two groups one based on zonally uniform channels names beginning with smooth and the other characterized by along slope topographic variations names beginning with corrug with finite positive values of y t and λ t in 1 preliminary experimentation reveals that flows in the corrug runs may be affected by the northern sponge layer if the offshore excursions of the continental slope are sufficiently large we therefore expanded the channel width to 600 km while retaining identical relaxation at the northern 50 km wide boundary in all corrug simulations further expansion of the channel width to 800 km yielded negligible differences to the corrug results to facilitate comparison between simulations we partition the corrugated slope domains into southern central and northern slope regions delineated by the latitudes y y s w s y t y s w s y y s w s y s w s and y y s w s y s w s y t respectively as such the central slope region of a zonally uniform channel is also its entire slope region since y t 0 see fig 1 c d the southern and northern slope regions accommodate if any onshore intrusion of canyons and offshore excursion of ridges respectively all model runs integrate the three dimensional hydrostatic boussinesq momentum equations coupled with a linearized equation of state depending on potential temperature only each simulation is spun up from a resting state at a coarse 4 km resolution for 35 years until a statistically steady state is reached as determined from the time series of total kinetic energy the solutions are then interpolated onto a finer 2 km grid and re run for another 15 years to re establish statistical equilibrium daily outputs taken from the final 5 years are analyzed 2 3 simulated flows fig 1 a b illustrate snapshots of sea surface potential temperature color contours along with topographic geometries in the reference simulation smooth reference and in a simulation with a slightly corrugated continental slope corrug 200 λ t 12 5 y t λ t 200 km y t 12 5 km respectively selected isobaths black contours and quasi streamlines 1 1 the time mean surface horizontal velocity fields in our simulations are not exactly divergence free the quasi streamlines are selected contours of the quasi streamfunction calculated as ψ surf x y 0 y u z 0 d y of the time mean horizontal velocity field u h at sea surface white contours are superposed on the potential temperature where denotes a time average over the 5 year long analysis period vigorous eddies are visible in both simulations however while the surface mean flow is almost exactly aligned with the isobaths in fig 1 a standing meanders 2 2 in this article we use the terms standing meanders stationary meanders and standing eddies interchangeably with horizontal scales comparable to the zonal extent of the topographic variations arise and traverse the isobaths in fig 1 b numerous studies have shown that standing meanders in retrograde flows over a corrugated shelf slope result from the arrested pv waves generated by topographic variations allen 1975 wang and mooers 1976 csanady 1978 brink 1986 1991 connolly et al 2014 zhang and lentz 2017 2018 similar to those found in the antarctic circumpolar current over a topographic ridge treguier and mcwilliams 1990 stevens and ivchenko 1997 abernathey and cessi 2014 thompson and naveira garabato 2014 stewart and hogg 2017 accompanying the standing meanders is the lower contrast of potential temperature between the shelf slope and the open ocean suggesting stronger restratification compared to the case shown in fig 1 a in fig 1 c d we quantify the time zonal averages of potential temperature θ and zonal velocity u superposed on the logarithms of time zonal mean eddy kinetic energy eke 1 2 u 2 v 2 per unit mass where 1 l x d x denotes the zonal mean operator and the prime denotes the deviation of a quantity from its time mean eke exhibits similar structures and magnitudes between the simulations however in the presence of standing meanders the retrograde flow is weakened with its maximum strength shifted onshore and the topographically induced prograde flow see ws18 for the interpretation of prograde flow generation where u 0 m s occupies a larger area 2 4 cross slope eddy buoyancy mixing in this study we specifically focus on developing scalings for transient eddy buoyancy fluxes across alongshore uniform continental slopes and then assessing the transferability of these scalings to corrugated continental slopes which induce stronger restratification fig 1 a b and support weaker retrograde flows fig 1 c d for brevity a detailed examination of the dynamics of mesoscale eddies over corrugated continental slopes is deferred to a future study in the smooth simulations the cross slope fluxes can be equivalently defined as those across the meridians or across the isobaths over a corrugated slope however these two types of fluxes differ meridional fluxes at a fixed latitude are determined by flows both over the ridges and within the canyons at the same latitude and represent the deviations from the large scale zonal mean flow this type of fluxes can be readily decomposed into a transient eddy part and a standing eddy part e g bischoff and thompson 2014 however the cross isobath fluxes are confined above certain depths and are directly shaped by the topographic pv gradient this type of fluxes has been previously calculated to study fluid parcel exchanges between the shallow shelves and the open ocean e g brink 2010 2011 gan et al 2009 2013 or restated meridional fluxes may include both cross isobath and along isobath components whereas cross isobath fluxes stress the motions traversing absolute depths there is thus no reason to expect that a single scaling would apply to both types of eddy fluxes over a corrugated slope to illustrate the impact of standing meanders to the cross slope buoyancy transfer by transient eddies we first quantify the depth averaged eddy buoyancy diffusivities in fig 2 as functions of latitude using the meridional transient eddy heat fluxes 3 3 as our simulations employ a linear equation of state depending on the potential temperature only buoyancy flux is proportional to heat flux and we therefore use these two terms interchangeably in this article defined by 9a κ θ f θ h 0 θ y d z 9b f θ h 0 v θ d z the definition 9a 9b avoids ill defined κ θ in well mixed regions by integrating the eddy buoyancy flux f θ and mean buoyancy gradient separately e g jansen et al 2015 across the slope κ θ in the presence of canyons ridges red solid curve ranges from 10 m 2 s at y 150 km to 74 m 2 s at y 250 km and is in general larger than that in the zonally uniform channel for y 168 km blue curve which ranges from 5 m 2 s to 26 m 2 s across the same latitudinal range with its minimum reaching 3 m 2 s at y 163 km the enhanced meridional buoyancy diffusivity produced by corrug 200 λ t 12 5 y t is consistent with the weakened meridional temperature gradient over the shelf slope fig 1 a b we then calculate the buoyancy diffusivity using the cross isobath rather than the meridional heat fluxes 10a κ θ i s o h h 0 f

2 red dashed line as a function of the mean offshore distance of each isobath it should be noted that both 9b and 10b automatically eliminate the rotational component of transient eddy fluxes based on the two dimensional divergence theorem marshall and shutts 1981 fox kemper et al 2003 4 4 it follows from two dimensional divergence theorem that the total eddy flux across the boundary of a control area is equal to the integral of the divergence of eddy flux over this area the rotational component of the eddy flux vanishes via the divergence operator upon area integral in a periodic channel model subject to no normal flow lateral boundary conditions the divergent eddy flux can only traverse the open boundaries defined by isobaths in addition calculation of f θ i s o h h 0 via 10b is far more efficient than using the isobath normal components of the depth integrated eddy fluxes which have to be obtained by interpolating eddy fluxes from the regular model grids onto the lateral location of each isobath the cross isobath flux gradient are exactly identical to the meridional flux gradient for smooth runs the cross isobath buoyancy diffusivity κ θ i s o in corrug 200 λ t 12 5 y t is generally smaller in magnitude than the meridional diffusivity κ θ in either of the simulations shown here over the continental slope 3 scaling cross slope buoyancy mixing our findings in sections 2 3 2 4 suggest that the cross slope buoyancy transfer can be quantitatively modulated by standing eddies for instance standing eddies can drive stronger restratification figs 1 a b and 2 furthermore topographically induced prograde flows which were shown to be associated with upgradient buoyancy fluxes by transient eddies see fig 10 of ws18 tend to be enhanced in the presence of standing eddies fig 1 c d these quantitative differences should be factored into the scaling parameterization of cross slope buoyancy transfer which necessarily incorporate the effects of both transient and standing eddies however there is no basis yet for parameterizing standing eddy fluxes which must be addressed in future work the qualitative behavior of transient eddies such as the surface intensification of eke fig 1 c d nevertheless remain when topographic corrugation is introduced this makes the smooth simulations which carry the advantage of isolating the transient eddy fluxes from the standing meanders a natural starting point for our investigation in this article we focus on the local i e depth averaged cross slope eddy buoyancy mixing shown in fig 2 as a first step toward a more general parameterization these diagnostics integrate the vertical structure of the eddy fluxes which typically serve to restratify the ocean close to the surface but destratify close to the bottom slope ws18 see also appendix a however even the depth averaged eddy diffusivity may still turn negative over portions of the continental slope see fig 2 we note that recently developed parameterizations of eddy transfer in the open ocean are formulated in terms of similar depth averaged diffusivities jansen et al 2015 mak et al 2017 2018 in this section we aim to derive scalings of eddy buoyancy mixing that transition smoothly from zonally uniform continental slopes to open ocean environments and subsequently evaluate the transferability of these scalings to the corrugated continental slopes 3 1 parameter dependence of eddy buoyancy diffusivity to assess the effect of mean retrograde flow properties on the cross slope eddy mixing one has several options to define a parameter space within which three of the non dimensional numbers are arguably the most crucial the local slope parameter 11 δ loc h h h 0 n s 2 d z n h 0 h b d z the local richardson number 12 r i loc h f 0 2 h 0 n s 2 d z n h 0 h b d z 2 and the local slope burger number 13 b u loc h h f 0 h h 0 n s d z where n h h h h is the offshore isobath normal unit vector in the smooth simulations the lateral buoyancy gradient h b is almost exactly aligned with n fig 1 a and we therefore have 14 n h 0 h b d z h 0 h b d z h 0 m 2 d z later in section 4 we extend the definitions 11 12 to the corrug simulations in which the mean flows are no longer parallel to the bathymetry fig 1 b in the modified qg eady 1949 model the slope parameter hinges upon the sign of the lateral pv gradient at the ocean bed which determines the coupling of linear baroclinic modes at the bottom and at the surface vallis 2006 the dynamic meaning of the slope parameter defined by 11 is much less obvious in more general cases where interior pv gradients become finite but previous studies indicate that a quantitative relation between δ loc and cross slope eddy diffusivity still exists e g isachsen 2011 stewart and thompson 2013 the richardson number is an indicator of baroclinicity of the flow and has been used in multiple studies to parameterize eddy buoyancy fluxes e g visbeck et al 1997 marshall et al 2012 bachman and fox kemper 2013 finally recent study of hetland 2017 suggests that the slope burger number is critical in constraining the eddy growth in prograde fronts while its role in retrograde fronts has yet to be determined it should be noted that any two of these non dimensional numbers can be used to approximate the third hetland 2017 15 b u loc r i loc 1 2 h h n s f 0 n s f 0

i 1 2 is the isopycnal interface between layers i and i 1 and g i g ρ i 1 ρ i ρ 0 stands for the associated reduced gravity the local epe can be calculated either via the layers package in mitgcm e g mak et al 2018 or by converting the diagnostics on a geopotential coordinate system onto isopycnal coordinates following young 2012 in this study we follow the latter approach by selecting a total of n lay 71 isopycnal layers with buoyancy intervals selected based on the prescribed vertical discretization of the buoyancy field in the northern sponge layer previous studies have found these dimensional parameters to be salient in parameterizing eddy effects in the open ocean e g eden and greatbatch 2008 cessi 2008 marshall et al 2012 jansen et al 2015 we diagnose the non dimensional numbers 11 13 the dimensional quantities 16 18 and the cross slope eddy buoyancy diffusivity κ θ in portions of the model domain where the ocean depth lies between 510 m and 3990 m for simulations with widened continental slopes we further constrain the analysis to the region south of y 350 km i e at least 100 km away from the northern sponge layer to avoid the influence of the lateral boundaries and the weak topographic pv gradient β t in nearly flat regions ws18 has shown in their fig 3 that potential energy conversion from eke may occur throughout the water column between y 350 km and 450 km due to the buoyancy restoring at the northern boundary in the reference run these analysis regions aggregated across all smooth simulations yield 1428 latitudinal bands from which to draw diagnostics of 11 13 and 16 18 we then zonally average and plot these parameters against κ θ via gray markers in fig 3 and in appendix b diagnostics made within the continental slope region y y s w s y s w s which are consistently between 938 m and 3568 m depths in our simulations are highlighted using a darker gray tone we stress that although these controlling parameters were coupled in several ways to parameterize baroclinic eddy fluxes in previous studies e g visbeck et al 1997 spall 2004 jansen et al 2015 each of them in isolation does not necessarily have a functional relationship with the eddy diffusivity fig 3 a shows the relationship between the bottom slope steepness relative to the isopycnal slope and the cross slope eddy buoyancy diffusivity consistent with previous studies based on primitive equation simulations e g isachsen 2011 stewart and thompson 2013 cross slope eddy mixing is increasingly suppressed as δ deviates from 0 toward positive values however in contrast to the linear prediction blumsack and gierasch 1972 mechoso 1980 no stabilization of the flow is found for δ 1 in fact the cross slope eddy mixing appears to increase approximately linearly with δ for δ 1 the discrepancy between the linear prediction based on the modified eady 1949 or phillips 1951 model and the non linear model results is mainly due to the lack of interior pv gradient and flow nonlinearity in the former trodahl and isachsen 2018 ghaffari et al 2018 many functional forms could be used to fit the relation between κ θ and δ loc favoring simplicity we use a sum of a linear function and a reciprocal function 19 κ θ γ δ loc 1 φ δ loc γ as illustrated by fig 3 a here γ 2 5 is the estimated slope of the linear functional part φ 5 1 0 2 is a constant that adjusts the decay rate of the reciprocal functional part and γ 1 denotes a positive constant to accommodate the limit δ loc 0 i e nearly flat ocean bed case it should be noted that there is no theoretical basis for the functional fit 19 following previous studies e g stewart and thompson 2013 our approach is entirely empirical the least squares error produced by 19 decreases by a factor of 2 compared to a linear functional fit if diagnostics from both the continental slope and the open ocean regions are accounted for when diagnostics from the continental shelf are also included the relation 19 generates a slightly larger error than a linear fit partly due to the emergence of negative eddy diffusivity and local slope parameter this issue can be fixed by replacing the reciprocal function in 19 with an exponential decay however our key findings reported in later sections do not qualitatively depend on such modifications crucially the mathematically simple form of 19 helps to simplify our analysis contrasted to most other nonlinear functions the eddy diffusivity is then predicted to reach its minimum as δ loc 4 42 o 1 as the ocean bed becomes steeper eddy mixing starts to be constrained by the linear functional part of 19 for δ loc i e zero projection of isopycnal slope in the cross slope direction this simple approximation becomes unbounded we return to this point and discuss potential regularizations for this issue in section 5 fig 3 b exhibits widespread scatter of the local richardson number r i loc against the eddy diffusivity κ θ further examination suggests the relation 20 κ θ γ 1 0 3 r i loc 1 2 with γ varying from 1 to 350 depending on the simulations and geographic locations similar to 19 the relation 20 is empirical selected from many possible nonlinear fits the cases exhibiting weakly negative values of γ are those dominated by eddy destratification which are relatively rare in the smooth simulations see section 4 over continental slopes γ 75 yields a good fit for all simulations with the least squares error smaller than from an optimized linear fit by a factor of approximately 1 85 these results may seem counter intuitive as higher richardson number suggests weaker baroclinicity of the along slope flow and thus lower available potential energy reservoir in the classical eady 1949 model baroclinic mode growth rate is exactly proportional to f 0 r i e g pedlosky 1987 vallis 2006 suggesting an anti correlation between κ θ and r i loc 1 2 if the linear modes govern the eddy mixing existing eddy parameterizations also treat the eady growth rate as a key parameter e g visbeck et al 1997 marshall et al 2012 the relationships between the eddy diffusivity and the other selected parameters 13 and 16 18 are shown in appendix b of the potential controlling parameters explored only the local slope parameter δ loc in isolation exhibits a strong functional relation with the eddy diffusivity in both the continental slope and open ocean environments although the local richardson number r i loc constrains eddy buoyancy fluxes across the continental slope and has been incorporated in existing eddy parameterizations e g visbeck et al 1997 marshall et al 2012 bachman and fox kemper 2013 the eddy buoyancy diffusivity cannot be scaled by r i loc alone in the open ocean environment other parameters in isolation may exhibit functional relationships with the eddy diffusivity in the open ocean but not over the continental slope see appendix b these findings suggests that existing eddy parameterizations may be adaptable to continental slopes via the introduction of a dependence on the local slope parameter as shown in the following sections 3 2 scaling of eddy mixing via the geometric framework the observation that κ θ tends to scale with r i loc 1 2 fig 3 b motivates the application of a recently developed paradigm of eddy parameterization that combines the square root of the richardson number with the total eddy energy namely the geometric framework marshall et al 2012 bachman et al 2017 mak et al 2017 2018 specifically marshall et al 2012 defined 21 κ geom γ geom n s m 2 e γ geom r i f 0 e based on a geometric constraint on the eliassen palm flux tensor in quasi geostrophic flows here γ geom is a non dimensional prefactor whose magnitude is bounded by unity and e denotes the sum of the eke and the epe per unit mass in a coarse resolution ocean model if an additional prognostic equation for the subgrid eddy energy budget is implemented e g mak et al 2018 the only free parameter in 21 is γ geom which contains the information about the partition between the eke and epe and the anisotropy of the eddy buoyancy fluxes marshall et al 2012 it should be noted that the cross slope eddy diffusivity can turn negative even in a depth averaged sense over zonally uniform slopes fig 3 this contradicts other eddy parameterizations that permit vertically local destratification of flows by baroclinic eddies but ensure net potential energy destruction across a full water column e g ferrari et al 2010 this further motivates the application of the geometric framework over steep slopes the coefficient γ geom may become predominantly negative across a water column if the relative orientation of the eddy buoyancy flux to the mean buoyancy gradient is sufficiently small marshall et al 2012 fig 4 a demonstrates the performance of the local geometric scaling 22a κ geom γ r i loc f 0 e loc 22b e loc 1 h h 0 eke d z i 1 n lay 1 epe i in quantifying κ θ over continental slopes here γ γ geom 1 08 1 0 2 is a constant that optimizes the linear fit between the scaling 22a 22b and the diagnosed diffusivities and e loc denotes the depth averaged total eddy energy per unit mass a strong correlation r 2 0 87 is found the prefactor γ 1 08 1 0 2 is smaller than proposed by mak et al 2018 for open ocean applications by a factor of almost 4 reflecting the much less efficient extraction of the mean flow energy via downgradient eddy buoyancy fluxes over steep slopes marshall et al 2012 bachman et al 2017 and the bulk compensation between surface intensified baroclinic instability and bottom trapped eddy destratification ws18 the transition of the local geometric prefactor 23 γ geom κ θ r i loc f 0 e loc from the continental slopes toward the nearly flat regions can be quantified via the local slope parameter and is illustrated in fig 4 b approaching the nearly flat regions the prefactor ranges from 0 to over 0 1 with a median of approximately 0 04 consistent with the values adopted in idealized simulations of the antarctic circumpolar current mak et al 2017 2018 over continental slopes γ geom tends to converge between 0 01 and 0 02 the weakest mixing is found for δ loc between 0 5 and 4 0 a preliminary parameterization of 23 that captures this trend 24a γ geom γ f geom δ loc 24b f geom δ loc ψ tanh γ δ loc 1 δ loc γ is presented in fig 4 b where γ o 1 0 2 denotes a constant coefficient that sets the overall magnitude of the geometric prefactor and f geom is an empirical function that measures the variation of γ geom with δ loc two parameters are defined in f geom and summarized in table 3 ψ 1 35 captures the re scaled geometric prefactor over steep slopes and γ 0 1 controls the asymptotic approach of f geom to ψ for large δ loc and avoids f geom becoming ill defined as δ loc 0 eq 24a is then bounded by γ γ 0 08 i e twice as large as the value used by mak et al 2018 as δ loc 0 and converges to γ ψ 0 01 as δ loc substitution of this parameterization in place of the constant coefficient in 22 yields a closer agreement between κ geom and κ θ with their correlation raised to r 2 0 92 when the diagnostics from the open ocean both the open ocean and the continental shelf are included the diagnosis scaling correlation is r 2 0 61 r 2 0 45 not plotted with a constant prefactor but reaches r 2 0 90 r 2 0 76 with the parameterization 24 as illustrated in fig 5 a following bachman et al 2017 we proceed to investigate whether the predictive power of the geometric scaling subject to a constant prefactor is constrained by differing eddy energy types used in 22b to this end we recalculate κ geom with the total eddy energy e loc in 22a replaced by either the local eke or the local epe fig 4 c d indicates that although both energy types serve to establish positive correlations between the geometric scaling and the diagnosed eddy diffusivity the local epe appears to play a more important role over steep slopes this is in contrast with the finding of bachman et al 2017 that the predictive skill of the geometric formula is independent of the eddy energy type adopted over a flat bottomed ocean 3 3 the cross front scaling of eddy buoyancy transfer we next formulate an alternative scaling for the cross slope eddy buoyancy transfer conventional dimensional arguments suggest that the eddy diffusivity can be defined as the product of a squared length scale and a inverse time scale c f section 1 here we use the topographic rhines scale and the constant coriolis frequency to construct our scaling we stress that these choices are made based entirely on a variety of trials not shown rather than upon any theoretical basis because neither quantity in isolation has a functional relationship with the eddy diffusivity over the continental slope appendix b we further affix a local slope parameter to capture the variation of the eddy diffusivity over steep slopes shown in fig 3 a and define 25 κ cf γ cf δ loc l rh 2 f 0 here γ cf is a non dimensional coefficient and the subscript cf stands for cross front this name was motivated by an alternative writing of 25 26 κ cf δ loc l rh 2 f 0 h h n s 2 m 2 u e β t f 0 f 0 h h h h n s 2 m 2 u e β t β t h n s 2 m 2 u e β t u e n s 2 m 2 h which is a mlt like scaling with the characteristic eddy velocity defined in 17 and the eddy length scale n s 2 m 2 h measuring the horizontal distance required for the tilted isopycnals to span the entire ocean depth the rearrangement 26 suggests that κ cf does not explicitly depend on the topographic steepness but rather on the isopycnal slope if γ cf is defined as a constant the local cf scaling following 26 27 κ cf γ u e h h 0 n s 2 d z h 0 m 2 d z exhibits a strong correlation r 2 0 83 with the diagnosed cross slope eddy diffusivity fig 6 a where γ γ cf 4 1 0 4 has been chosen to optimize the linear fit the correlation reduces to r 2 0 70 if the diagnostics from the open ocean are included and to r 2 0 57 if both the continental shelf and open ocean portions are accounted for not shown which indicates that a constant prefactor is appropriate over steep slopes but unable to make the scaling transition smoothly from slopes toward the more flat regions the transition of the local cf prefactor 28a γ cf κ θ u e h s loc θ 28b s loc θ h 0 m 2 d z h 0 n s 2 d z from the continental slope to the nearly flat regions can be parameterized in terms of δ loc following the approach described in section 3 2 as shown in fig 6 b we propose a functional relation between the cf scaling prefactor and the local slope parameter that is similar to 24 29a γ cf γ f cf δ loc 29b f cf δ loc ψ tanh γ δ loc 1 2 δ loc γ where γ o 1 0 3 is a constant that sets the overall magnitude of γ cf as in 24b the parameters in 29b ψ 0 5 and γ 0 1 are selected to approximate the variation of the empirical function f cf with δ loc see table 3 then it follows that γ cf is bounded by γ γ 8 1 0 3 in the flat bottom limit and converges to γ ψ 4 1 0 4 over steep slopes replacement of the constant coefficient in 27 with the parameterization 29 yields a diagnosis scaling correlation of r 2 0 86 over steep slopes and of r 2 0 91 r 2 0 77 if one includes the diagnostics from the open ocean region both the open ocean and the shelf regions as shown in fig 5 b next we assess which of the variables that constitute the eddy length scale are most crucial in predicting the cross slope eddy diffusivity when γ cf is fixed as a constant in fig 6 c we plot a simplified form of the cf scaling 30 κ cf γ u e z s h 0 n s 2 d z h 0 m 2 d z with which we maintain the spatially varying isopycnal slope but replace the ocean depth h in 27 with the slope mid depth z s table 1 interestingly the diagnosis scaling correlation gets even stronger r 2 0 89 compared to the case with the original local cf form 27 further replacement of the local vertical stratification h 0 n s 2 d z h with the cross slope averaged vertical stratification leads to 31a κ cf γ u e z s n 0 2 1 h h 0 m 2 d z 31b n 0 2 slope 1 h h 0 n s 2 d z d a slope d a where the subscript slope denotes the region over which the integral is performed the modification 31 slightly changes the scatter pattern between the scaling and the diagnosed diffusivity but not the predictive skill of the cf scaling fig 6 d eqs 31a 31b also indicate that the cross slope eddy buoyancy fluxes f θ κ cf 1 h h 0 m 2 d z scale only with the characteristic eddy velocity u e reminiscent of the empirical findings by stewart and thompson 2016 that the eddy thickness fluxes across the antarctic continental margin scale with u e alone see their eq 25 if the isopycnal slope quantity in 27 is substituted by its cross slope average the correlation between κ θ and κ cf is diminished r 2 0 69 not shown maintaining the spatially varying ocean depth and local vertical stratification while replacing the spatially varying horizontal stratification with its cross slope average produces an even lower correlation between the scaling and the diagnosed eddy diffusivity r 2 0 41 not shown implementation of the cf formula over continental slopes for parameterization purposes should therefore preserve the spatial variation of the local isopycnal slope or at least the horizontal stratification we note that 26 resembles the eddy buoyancy transfer coefficient proposed by bachman and fox kemper 2013 32 κ b13 γ r i 0 31 u e n s 2 m 2 h which is diagnosed from a set of eady like spin down simulations see also bachman et al 2017 eq 32 differs from 26 by a factor of r i 0 31 over the continental slope the local richardson number varies between o 10 o 1 0 3 fig 3 b leading to the decrease of the predicted eddy diffusivity via κ b13 by a factor of 2 10 compared to κ cf in fig 7 a we plot the local form of 33 κ b13 γ r i loc 0 31 u e h h 0 n s 2 d z h 0 m 2 d z against κ θ with γ 2 5 1 0 3 chosen to minimize the linear mismatch the correlation r 2 0 59 between the two quantities is much lower than the case shown in fig 6 a by replacing the eddy velocity scale u e in 26 with the mean thermal wind velocity one obtains the eddy transfer coefficient formulated by fox kemper et al 2008 34 κ fk08 γ n s 2 h 2 f 0 which has been implemented to parameterize submesoscale eddy restratification in the mixed layer in global ocean climate models fox kemper et al 2011 as pointed out by bachman et al 2017 κ fk08 does not depend on the eddy energy budget due to its differing definition of the characteristic velocity scale in fig 7 b we compare the local form 35 κ fk08 γ h h 0 n s 2 d z f 0 with κ θ where γ 2 1 0 4 optimizes the linear fit an almost identical correlation r 2 0 59 compared to the case shown in fig 7 a is reached between κ θ and κ fk08 while the weakened correlation between κ b13 and diagnostics sources from the richardson number dependent multiplier in 33 it is mainly the omission of the isopycnal slope quantity i e m 2 n 2 that lowers the predictive skill of 35 3 4 slope dependent mixing length theory although the original form of the cf scaling 25 incorporates the local slope parameter δ loc further transformation 26 frames it as a mlt based scaling that is relatively insensitive to topographic steepness over continental slopes see also fig 6 b it is then natural to ask whether other mlt based eddy parameterizations most of which do not explicitly incorporate topographic effects apply to continental slopes this question is also practical in that modern ocean general circulation models such as the latest version of the modular ocean model mom6 have a set of mlt based eddy parameterizations implemented most of these parameterizations depend on a variety of optional length scales plus a prognostic subgrid eke budget to apply these parameterizations over continental slopes one has to first select the most appropriate eddy length scale 3 4 1 previous mixing length theory based scalings various studies have proposed that the eddy buoyancy transfer coefficient can be parameterized as 36 κ mlt u e l e where u e is drawn from the local eke budget following 17 and l e denotes an eddy length scale to be determined e g eden and greatbatch 2008 cessi 2008 jansen et al 2015 recently jansen et al 2015 has demonstrated that assigning the rhines scale defined via planetary vorticity gradient as the eddy length scale such that 37 κ mlt u e l rh broadly quantifies the eddy buoyancy mixing over a flat bottomed ocean via a suite of idealized simulations see their fig 6 the eddy length scale has previously been defined as the width of the baroclinic zone across which baroclinic eddies were mostly generated e g visbeck et al 1997 bachman and fox kemper 2013 jansen et al 2015 in the context of continental slope one choice for the width of the baroclinic zone is the width of the slope see table 1 i e 38 κ mlt u e w s this formulation has been reported to accurately quantify the cross slope eddy thickness flux in the antarctic slope front stewart and thompson 2016 eden and greatbatch 2008 have advocated to prescribe the eddy length scale not only by the rhines scale but also by the first rossby radius of deformation such that 39 κ mlt u e min l d l rh this approach was motivated by the observation that eddy mixing is more isotropic anisotropic and limited by the deformation radius rhines scale at mid low latitude eden 2007 others have chosen to only use the deformation radius when testing eddy parameterizations e g cessi 2008 eddy growth over a flat bottomed ocean subject to quadratic bottom drag and vanishing pv gradient can also be limited by a frictional scale l f e g jansen et al 2015 leading to 40 κ mlt u e l f l f h e c d where h e denotes the vertical scale of near bottom flow over topography h e can be identified with the prandtl e folding scale e g rhines 1970 treguier and mcwilliams 1990 merryfield and holloway 1999 brink 2016 see also appendix a and is naturally bounded by the ocean depth h i e 41 h e min l j f 0 h h 0 n s d z h where l j l rh stands for the width of near bottom jets and has been defined as the topographic rhines scale consistent with previous studies e g maltrud and vallis 1991 1992 thompson 2010 ws18 eqs 40 41 suggests that the jet width which may represent the scale at which nonlinear eddies equilibrate differs from the frictional scale by a factor of c d n s f 0 which is far less than unity across the regions of our interest with its maximum below 0 08 we thereby speculate that the eddy growth is much less constrained by the frictional scale than by the topographic rhines scale over continental slopes fig 8 a d compares κ θ with the eddy transfer coefficient 36 via different choices for the eddy length scale the correlations are invariably weak or even negative which may have been anticipated as no quantitative trend is revealed between the diagnosed eddy diffusivity and the local topographic rhines scale or the local eke see appendix b it should be noted that the actual application of the scaling 36 as eddy parameterizations also requires the knowledge of the subgrid eke which is not always available in coarse resolution ocean models we therefore assess two additional scalings that are independent of the local eke one developed by visbeck et al 1997 42 κ v97 γ f 0 r i l e 2 γ σ e l e 2 and the other by stone 1972 43 κ s72 γ σ max λ 2 σ σ max here γ denotes the constant coefficient to be determined for each case σ max is the maximum growth rate of linear baroclinic waves and λ σ σ max is the corresponding wavelength eq 42 defines the eddy velocity scale as the product of the eddy length scale l e and the eady growth rate σ e f 0 r i whereas 43 uses the product of the wavelength and growth rate of the most unstable baroclinic linear mode visbeck et al 1997 assigned the width of baroclinic zone as the eddy length scale and found that a constant prefactor γ 0 015 in 42 applied to a range of baroclinic processes over steep slopes however we found no optimal length scale for 42 after a series of tests not shown the topographic rhines scale is thus chosen as a representative case fig 8 e shows that the local form of 42 44 κ v97 γ f 0 r i loc l rh 2 is uncorrelated with the diagnosed diffusivity under the eady 1949 or phillips 1954 model setup κ s72 is equivalent to κ v97 if the deformation radius is used as the eddy length scale since the most unstable mode resulting from the interacting surface and bottom edge waves has fixed wavelength proportional to the deformation radius vallis 2006 in primitive equation simulations however the most unstable baroclinic mode is not necessarily excited by edge wave interactions and its wavelength has to be diagnosed locally in addition lateral shear of the alongshore flow tends to modulate the linear wave characteristics killworth 1980 we therefore conducted a linear stability analysis following the approach detailed in section 4 4 of ws18 to extract the most unstable modes whose wavelength is at least half of the deformation radius at each latitude across the slope region expanding the search range in wavelength does not change the result fig 8 f shows that the stone 1972 scaling is uncorrelated with the diagnosed eddy diffusivity 3 4 2 slope aware mixing length theory based scalings we now adapt these tested mlt based scalings to a sloping ocean bed by utilizing an empirical functional relation between the eddy buoyancy diffusivity and the local slope parameter that is similar to 19 our proposed scaling follows 45 κ mlt γ δ loc 1 δ loc γ u e l e here γ is a constant prefactor and γ 1 can be adjusted so that γ γ reaches the same order of magnitude as the mlt scaling coefficient diagnosed over a flat ocean bed δ loc 0 eq 45 differs from 36 by a factor of δ loc 1 δ loc γ which as we show in the following significantly improves its predictive skill we treat jansen et al s 2015 diagnostics over a flat ocean bed summarized in their fig 6 as a starting point to better frame the order of magnitude of γ in fig 9 a we plot the cross slope eddy diffusivity κ θ against the δ dependent mlt based scaling using the topographic rhines scale 16 and the eddy velocity 17 46a κ mlt γ f mlt δ loc u e l rh 46b f mlt δ loc δ loc 1 δ loc γ where γ 3 3 1 0 3 is selected to optimize the linear fit between κ mlt and κ θ and γ 1 0 1 0 2 simplifies 46 to κ mlt 0 33 u e l rh when δ loc 0 see table 3 the prefactor then reaches the same order of magnitude as that diagnosed by jansen et al 2015 importantly the correlation achieved by κ mlt against κ θ r 2 0 92 is much enhanced compared to the case shown in fig 8 a next we replace the topographic rhines scale in 46 with the slope half width table 1 and plot the redefined κ mlt against κ θ in fig 9 b the prefactor γ 4 0 1 0 4 is again chosen to optimize the diagnosis scaling linear fit which combined with γ 1 0 1 0 2 makes the prefactor asymptote to 4 0 1 0 2 in the flat bottom limit consistent with the value diagnosed by jansen et al 2015 when the baroclinic width was chosen as their eddy mixing length the correlation between κ θ and κ mlt r 2 0 82 slightly drops compared to the case shown in fig 9 a over steep slopes the topographic rhines scale is comparable in magnitude to the first rossby radius of deformation due to the suppressed eddy velocity scale and the increase of topographic pv gradient in fig 9 c we plot the relationship between the slope aware κ mlt with l rh substituted by l d in 46 and the diagnosed eddy diffusivity here γ 1 9 1 0 3 has the same order of magnitude as the prefactor when l rh serves as the mixing length however γ 1 0 1 0 3 makes the full coefficient of κ mlt approach o 1 in the flat bottomed ocean similar to the magnitude diagnosed by jansen et al 2015 the correlation is similarly strong r 2 0 90 as in the case shown in fig 9 a although we expect that the frictional scale to be less relevant over steep slopes adopting l f as the mixing length in 46 and assuming that l j l rh in 41 nevertheless yield a strong correlation between κ mlt and κ θ r 2 0 83 as shown in fig 9 d the prefactor has again been adjusted to optimize the diagnosis scaling linear fit and to account for the magnitude of the mlt based scaling reported by jansen et al 2015 the strong correlation does not imply that the eddy mixing is frictionally controlled over steep slopes but rather that the local buoyancy frequency h 0 n s d z h does not vary significantly the variation is within a factor of 2 across the entire channel leading to l f l rh based on 40 41 fig 9 a d indicates that the scaling 45 is insensitive to the eddy length scale chosen over steep slopes as long as the eddy velocity scale u e is used implementation of 45 should therefore prioritize the optimal mixing length scale that makes the scaling transition smoothly from the slope toward the open ocean if the diagnostics from the open ocean both the shelf and the open ocean are included in the comparison the correlation of the rhines scale based κ mlt 46 with the diagnosed diffusivity reduces to r 2 0 79 r 2 0 65 as shown in fig 5 c defining the frictional length scale which is partly dependent on the topographic rhines scale as the mixing length in 45 slightly modifies the diagnosis scaling correlation the correlation coefficient is r 2 0 71 if the open ocean is included and r 2 0 52 if both the shelf and the open ocean are included not shown in contrast neither the deformation radius nor the slope half width produces a diagnosis scaling correlation better than r 2 0 06 if the open ocean diagnostics are included our findings therefore suggest that the rhines scale is the most suitable choice for the eddy mixing length mirroring findings of jansen et al 2015 in the context of a flat bottomed ocean in fig 9 e f we also test the slope aware forms of the local visbeck et al 1997 scaling 47 κ v97 γ f mlt f 0 r i loc l rh 2 and the local stone 1972 scaling 48 κ s72 γ f mlt σ max λ 2 σ σ max these formulations do not show significant improvements in predictive skill compared to their slope unaware counterparts our findings suggest that accurate implementation of the mlt based scaling for steep slopes depends crucially on the subgrid eke budget 4 impact of along slope topographic variations sections 3 2 3 4 suggest that eddy buoyancy mixing across continental slopes can be reproduced via the geometric scaling the cf scaling or the δ dependent mlt based scaling that incorporates the eddy velocity scale u e and the topographic rhines scale l rh while both the geometric scaling and the cf scaling are able to quantify the eddy transfer across steep slopes with suitably chosen constant prefactors they require δ dependent prefactors to transition from the slope to the open ocean in this section we investigate the extent to which these slope aware scaling frameworks apply to continental slopes featuring topographic canyons and ridges over which standing meanders lead to stronger restratification and the topographically induced prograde flows tend to penetrate to the upper ocean c f section 2 3 4 1 meridional vs cross isobath eddy mixing in the context of corrugated continental slope we face a choice as whether to compare the scalings with the eddy buoyancy diffusivity directed across meridians 9a or across isobaths 10a to address this we first assess the functional dependence of eddy diffusivity on the two most crucial non dimensional parameters over steep slopes the local slope parameter and the local richardson number c f section 3 1 there is some freedom in defining these two parameters in the presence of canyons ridges because the mean geostrophic currents do not follow the isobaths fig 1 b one choice would be to completely neglect the zonal variations in the topography and mean flow and define these two parameters via the meridional components of the mean buoyancy and bathymetry gradients however the resulting δ loc and r i loc exhibit no correlation with the meridional eddy buoyancy transfer not shown instead we use the local slope parameter and the local richardson number defined by 11 and 12 respectively that is we ignore the cross isobath part of the mean flow and assume that the eddy buoyancy transfer either in the meridional direction or in the cross isobath direction is determined by the along isobath component of the large scale geostrophic current in fig 10 a we compare the zonally averaged slope parameter δ loc with the meridional eddy buoyancy diffusivity κ θ diagnostics have been drawn from three zonal regions across the channel i the region peripheral to the northern southern slope regions with ocean depths between 510 m and 3990 m and lying south of y 450 km ii the northern southern slope regions and iii the central slope region diagnostics from these regions have been plotted with light gray dark gray and blue markers respectively κ θ exhibits a much more scattered relationship with δ loc than in the smooth runs shown in fig 3 a the simple δ function fit 19 becomes limited in characterizing the variation of meridional mixing across corrugated slopes strongly negative diffusivities of o 100 m 2 s emerge on the peripheries of the continental slope and slightly negative eddy diffusivity with negative values of δ loc is found in the northern southern slope regions the negative values of δ loc are due to stationary recirculations residing over topographic ridges in fig 10 b we plot the cross isobath eddy diffusivity κ θ i s o defined by 10a against the local slope parameter averaged along isobaths 49 δ loc h h 0 δ loc d s d s here denotes the along isobath mean operator and the line integral operator is performed where h h 0 diagnostics from the shelf and open ocean regions defined by h 510 m 938 m and h 3568 m 3990 m respectively are plotted with light gray markers whereas the slope region defined by h 938 m 3568 m are plotted with blue markers our simulations show that the cross isobath eddy diffusivity is in general smaller in magnitude than the meridional one consistent with the example shown in fig 2 in addition the cross isobath eddy diffusivity appears to be better fit by our empirically derived function of δ loc 19 than the meridional eddy diffusivity indicating that the local slope parameter defined by 11 mainly constrains the cross isobath rather than meridional component of transient eddy buoyancy fluxes in fig 10 c and d we compare the relationship between the local richardson number and the eddy diffusivity under a zonal vs along isobath average respectively over corrugated slopes the local richardson number reaches o 1 0 2 o 1 0 7 due to the stronger restratification and thus weaker baroclinic shear of the flow the along isobath average calculation produces a better fit between the square root of the local richardson number 50 r i loc h h 0 r i loc d s d s and the eddy diffusivity κ θ i s o than that produced by the zonal average calculation 4 2 scaling cross isobath mixing over corrugated slopes in this section we evaluate the predictive skills of the scalings proposed in sections 3 2 3 4 over corrugated slopes we compare these scalings under an along isobath average because our diagnostics in fig 10 indicate that the local eddy diffusivity has stronger functional relationships with the local slope parameter and the local richardson number under an along isobath average than under a zonal average because the local slope parameter varies even along the isobaths of a corrugated slope due to the presence of standing eddies the δ dependent prefactors for these scalings are preserved from section 3 before the along isobath averages are made fig 11 a shows the relationship between κ θ i s o and the slope aware geometric scaling 51 κ geom topo γ f geom δ loc r i loc f 0 e loc in which the empirical function f geom is identical to 24b see table 3 for selected values of parameters in f geom and γ 1 02 1 0 2 is a constant chosen to optimize the linear fit between κ geom topo and κ θ i s o the diagnosis scaling correlation r 2 0 67 is smaller than for the case of zonally uniform slopes r 2 0 92 a fraction of diagnosed diffusivities such as those produced by corrug 200 λ t 12 5 y t highlighted with red markers and corrug 400 λ t 50 y t highlighted with blue markers are particularly poorly captured by 51 negative values of κ geom topo in corrug 400 λ t 50 y t indicates the presence of locally prograde fronts i e δ loc 0 associated with standing meanders in fig 11 b we investigate the factors that contribute to the diversion of diagnosed eddy diffusivity from the theoretical prediction by plotting the diagnosed geometric prefactor against the local slope parameter as in fig 4 b this plot shows that the empirical relation between γ geom and δ loc in the smooth simulations approximately applies to the corrug simulations however as the ocean bed becomes steeper the diagnosed prefactor exhibits more scatter in the corrug simulations than in the smooth simulations specifically for δ loc 10 the diagnosed geometric prefactor ranges between 0 94 1 84 in the smooth simulations but between 0 06 1 87 in the corrug simulations in fig 11 c we plot κ θ i s o against the slope aware cf scaling 52 κ cf topo γ f cf δ loc u e h h 0 n s 2 d z n h 0 h b d z in which n h h h h f cf is identical to 29b see table 3 for selected values of parameters in f cf and γ 8 9 1 0 4 is selected to optimize the linear fit the diagnosis scaling correlation r 2 0 73 is slightly stronger than that in fig 11 a but remains weaker than for the case of zonally uniform slopes r 2 0 86 as in the geometric case the weaker agreement between the diagnosed diffusivity and the scaling 52 shown in fig 11 c is partly due to the outlying results from corrug 200 λ t 12 5 y t and corrug 400 λ t 50 y t in fig 11 d we contrast κ θ i s o against the slope aware mlt based scaling 53 κ mlt topo γ f mlt δ loc u e l rh in which f mlt is identical to 46b see table 3 for selected value of parameter in f mlt and γ 4 6 1 0 3 optimizes the linear fit the diagnosis scaling correlation r 2 0 72 is comparable to those produced by the geometric and the cf scalings the weaker agreement between the diagnosed diffusivity and the scaling 53 contrasted to the smooth case r 2 0 92 is again partly attributed to the outlying results from corrug 200 λ t 12 5 y t and corrug 400 λ t 50 y t 4 3 cross slope averaged scaling of cross slope eddy mixing in the flat bottomed ocean context jansen et al 2015 proposed a parameterization using the bulk averaged eddy mixing over an entire baroclinic zone rather than using horizontally local properties this approach may also be favored over continental slopes as topographic corrugation leads to increased scatter of the diagnosed eddy diffusivity against the scalings proposed in this study see fig 11 in addition ws18 have shown that the eddy energy transfer becomes non local e g chen et al 2014 across steep slopes and any closure of the subgrid eddy energy from which the eddy velocity is provided based on the local production dissipation balance e g cessi 2008 may become inaccurate in fig 12 we plot the diagnosed cross isobath eddy diffusivity κ θ i s o against the three slope aware scalings after averaging over the continental slope regions defined by ocean depths in the range h 938 m 3568 m where denotes the bulk area mean operator diagnostics from both the smooth black markers and the corrug blue markers simulations are included all three scalings produce strong correlations r 2 0 80 with the diagnosed diffusivity across our suite of simulations the bulk eddy transfer coefficients in the smooth simulations are particularly closely reproduced with correlations exceeding r 2 0 89 and reaching r 2 0 98 for the mlt case 5 discussion and conclusion accurate representation of mesoscale eddy effects in coarse resolution ocean climate models remains a pressing challenge for the oceanographic community mid latitude mesoscale eddies over continental slopes in particular cannot be resolved even in eddy permitting global ocean models hallberg 2013 existing approaches of eddy parameterization have mostly been developed based on the open ocean turbulent properties and are thus independent of the bottom topography which may lead to incorrect water mass formations and adjustment of ocean general circulations over continental slopes in this article we have examined three numerically implementable scalings for eddy buoyancy transfer across retrograde slope fronts the geometric scaling originally developed by marshall et al 2012 a new cross front scaling derived via dimensional analysis and the mixing length theory mtl based scaling prandtl 1925 we demonstrate that both the geometric framework and the cf scaling are capable of quantifying the eddy diffusivity over the continental slope in isolation following the selection of suitable constant prefactor coefficients however in order to capture the eddy mixing across both the continental slope and the open ocean all three scaling approaches require the insertion of a prefactor that depends on the slope parameter δ we have shown that by making the prefactor a simple analytical function of the local slope parameter each of these scalings is able to reproduce the depth averaged eddy mixing over the slope and in the open ocean c f fig 5 however over continental shelves the eddy transfer coefficients are much less well captured by these scalings the reason for this is unclear and must be addressed in future work based on the studies focusing on continental shelves e g brink 2016 it should be noted that the continental shelves in our simulations are set to be unrealistically deep in order to isolate the cross slope eddy fluxes and therefore may have limited applicability to cross shelf eddy fluxes table 3 summarizes our proposed slope aware scalings with parameter values chosen based on our cross slope averaged calculation fig 12 which maximizes the agreements between the scalings and the diagnosed eddy diffusivity the prefactor for both the geometric framework and the cf scaling can be constructed as the sum of a sigmoid function e g hyperbolic tangent in this study and a decay function e g reciprocal function in this study of the local slope parameter which converge to empirical constants over the flat ocean bed and over steep slopes for mlt based scaling we propose a linear function of δ loc combined with a decay function however this function becomes unbounded if the isopycnals are completely flat over the slope i e δ loc for numerical implementation purposes one can fix this issue by replacing the linear function with a nonlinear one that asymptotes to an empirical constant or decay to zero when the slope parameter crosses a threshold value it should be noted that the sign of each slope aware scaling depends not only on the sign of the local slope parameter but also on the specific functional form of its prefactor a scaling designed for retrograde front i e δ loc 0 may thus stay positive when the slope parameter turns negative see fig 11 this issue can be addressed by adding a switch like heaviside function of δ loc that shuts down the mixing across a retrograde front when δ loc turns negative in the context of buoyancy driven prograde front i e δ loc 0 spall 2004 has previously proposed a slope dependent scaling for the eddy heat flux 54 v θ e 2 δ loc u tw δ θ where δ θ denotes the temperature or buoyancy difference across the front whose spatial span can be approximated by the slope width the scaling 54 was constructed to fit the analytical solution of eddy heat fluxes produced by the modified eady 1949 model blumsack and gierasch 1972 further rearrangement of 54 leads to 55 κ θ e 2 δ loc u tw w s which constitutes a mlt based scaling posed in terms of the thermal wind velocity and the width of the slope spall s 2004 results combined with our findings complement existing eddy parameterizations by incorporating the leading order effects of bottom topography the substantially differing dynamics induced by bottomcanyons ridges limits the applicability of the slope aware scalings developed based on eddy dynamics over zonally uniform slopes for instance our proposed scalings conceal the vertical structure of eddy mixing which may substantially impact the along slope flow in the presence of topographic corrugations this is reflected in fig 1 c d even slight bottom corrugation tends to expand the region occupied by topographically induced prograde flows notwithstanding these issues our recommended slope aware scalings produce much stronger correlations with the diagnosed cross isobath eddy diffusivity over corrugated slopes compared with those between the topography independent eddy parameterizations and diagnosed eddy transfer coefficients over zonally uniform slopes this indicates that adaption of existing eddy parameterizations via the δ functions is a promising avenue for future model development efforts parameterizing standing eddy effects over large scale topographic features remain an open challenge in physical oceanography though our scalings do not predict the standing eddy component of cross slope buoyancy flux they constitute a significant step toward parameterizing the transient component of cross slope buoyancy mixing and thus should be tested as parameterizations in coarse resolution models it is particularly important to investigate whether a coarse resolution model that can resolve large scale bathymetric variations but not transient eddy generation will be able to represent the standing eddy buoyancy fluxes across continental slopes such an investigation may be more pertinent to eddy permitting global ocean models e g uchida et al 2017 indeed for typical ipcc class earth system models with horizontal grid spacing of 1 or coarser even the continental shelf slope itself may be unresolved if eddy permitting models can indeed reproduce standing eddy fluxes a parameterization of the transient eddy buoyancy flux would be the only part that is required to represent the mesoscale to convert our proposed scalings into full closures of transient eddy buoyancy fluxes a priori knowledge of the eke or the total eddy energy is required modern ocean general circulation models such as the mom6 are increasingly maintaining prognostic subgrid eke or total eddy energy budgets e g jansen et al 2019 mak et al 2018 these models will serve as a natural starting point for testing slope aware eddy parameterizations however caution must taken given that most subgrid eddy energy budgets only reflect open ocean eddy properties over continental slopes lateral eke fluxes via anomalous pressure work are dominant in the upper ocean and eke tends to be converted into potential energy near the ocean bed ws18 both of which remain poorly constrained by existing eddy parameterizations e g eden and greatbatch 2008 maltrud and holloway 2008 5 5 maltrud and holloway 2008 and related work have proposed to implement a biharmonic or laplacian viscosity that forces a mean prograde flow along the isobaths of a continental slope thus ensembling the eddy rectified flow character however this approach is not energetically constrained in addition parameterization of eddy energy dissipation near topographic features remains a challenging research topic even for the well studied open ocean e g yang et al 2018 to accurately apply our proposed scalings existing formulations of subgrid eke budgets may need to be adapted to steep continental slopes though the slope aware scalings exhibit remarkable skill in quantifying the depth averaged cross slope eddy buoyancy transfer our idealized model configuration carries several caveats for instance we did not consider the effects of external buoyancy forcing which can considerably modulate the structure of slope fronts e g stewart and thompson 2013 time dependent wind forcing can also project onto mesoscale variability over steep slopes e g zhai and greatbatch 2007 renault et al 2016 and the evolution to equilibrium may be substantially modulated by eddy memory sinha and abernathey 2016 manucharyan et al 2017 manucharyan and isachsen 2019 tidal flows which have been completely neglected in this study may play a critical role in shaping the shelf break fronts brink 2012 2013 our study has focused on the cross slope eddy buoyancy transfer and it remains unclear how closely this is related to the isopycnal eddy mixing redi 1982 in the context of a flat bottomed ocean abernathey et al 2013 derived an analytical relation their eq 24 between the gm and the redi eddy transfer coefficients the merits of this relation in inferring the isopycnal diffusivity via the gm transfer coefficient particularly over continental slopes have yet to be investigated all these issues remain to be addressed in future investigations

sloping ocean bed appendix b additional parameter dependence of eddy buoyancy diffusivity the relation between b u loc and κ θ is illustrated in fig 14 a the eddy diffusivity rapidly decreases as the slope burger number increases from 0 over continental slopes however κ θ is rather insensitive to b u loc these can be understood via the relationships of δ loc and r i loc to the cross slope eddy diffusivity in the nearly flat bottomed ocean we have κ θ γ 1 δ loc 1 fig 3 a and κ θ γ 2 1 0 3 r i loc 1 2 fig 3 b where γ 1 50 and γ 2 1 350 then 15 leads to κ θ 1 0 3 4 50 γ 2 1 2 b u loc 1 2 in

have κ θ γ 1 δ loc fig 3 a and κ θ γ 2 1 0 3 r i loc 1 2 fig 3 b then 15 gives b u loc 0 95 for γ 1 2 5 and γ 2 75 which provides no information about the eddy diffusivity that is the eddy diffusivity is almost independent of the slope burger number over steep slopes in retrograde fronts fig 14 b contrasts the topographic rhines scale l rh with the cross slope eddy diffusivity we fit a weakly quadratic relation which produces a least squares error slightly smaller than that generated by an optimized linear fit by a factor of approximately 1 2 when diagnostics from the continental slope and the open ocean are considered the quadratic approximation is no better than a linear fit when the continental shelf is also included over the continental slope alone no clear correlation between the two quantities is found comparing κ θ against the first rossby radius of deformation or the rhines scale normalized by the deformation radius does not yield further insight not shown we plot the depth averaged eke and epe against the eddy diffusivity in fig 14 d and e respectively the two energy reservoirs are roughly equipartitioned with the local epe slightly higher the local eke the strength of the cross slope eddy mixing does not seem to be controlled by the amount of eddy energy alone indeed over continental slopes κ θ is generally below 120 m 2 s while neither the eke nor the epe are generally lower than that in regions away from the slope 
23989,baroclinic eddy restratification strongly influences the ocean s general circulation and tracer budgets and has been routinely parameterized via the gent mcwilliams gm scheme in coarse resolution ocean climate models these parameterizations have been improved via refinements of the gm eddy transfer coefficient using eddy resolving simulations and theoretical developments however previous efforts have focused primarily on the open ocean and the applicability of existing gm parameterization approaches to continental slopes remains to be addressed in this study we use a suite of eddy resolving process oriented simulations to test scaling relationships between eddy buoyancy diffusivity mean flow properties and topographic geometries in simulations of baroclinic turbulence over continental slopes we focus on the case of retrograde i e opposing the direction of topographic wave propagation winds a configuration that arises commonly around the margins of the subtropical gyres three types of scalings are examined namely the geometric framework developed by marshall et al 2012 a new cross front cf scaling derived via dimensional arguments and the mixing length theory mlt based scalings tested recently by jansen et al 2015 over a flat ocean bed the present study emphasizes the crucial role of the local slope parameter defined as the ratio between the topographic slope and the depth averaged isopycnal slope in controlling the nonlinear eddy buoyancy fluxes both the geometric framework and the cf scaling can reproduce the depth averaged eddy buoyancy transfer across alongshore uniform continental slopes for suitably chosen constant prefactors generalization of these scalings across both continental slope and open ocean environments requires the introduction of prefactors that depend on the local slope parameter via empirically derived analytical functions in contrast the mlt based scalings fail to quantify the eddy buoyancy transfer across alongshore uniform continental slopes when constant prefactors are adopted but can reproduce the cross slope eddy flux when the prefactors are adapted via empirical functions of the local slope parameter application of these scalings in prognostic ocean simulations also depends on an accurate representation of standing eddies associated with the topographic corrugations of the continental slope these findings offer a basis for extending existing approaches to parameterizing transient eddies and call for future efforts to parameterize standing eddies in coarse resolution ocean climate models

such a fine resolution mesoscale eddies cannot be resolved over continental slopes hallberg 2013 the rapid decrease of the ocean depth leads to a decrease of the rossby deformation radius and thus finer scales of unstable baroclinic modes compared to those in the open ocean in addition recent studies have revealed that baroclinic modes tend to be surface intensified over steep topography lacasce 2017 and require high vertical resolution to simulate in ocean models cast in geopotential coordinates e g stewart et al 2017 numerical experiments of freely evolving and wind driven baroclinic turbulence over topography point towards a bottom intensified eddy energy sink due to topographic rectification even in the absence of tides merryfield and holloway 1999 venaille 2012 wang and stewart 2018 ws18 hereafter indicating that eddy effects at the surface substantially differ from those near the sloping bottom e g lacasce 1998 lacasce and brink 2000 this invites the question to what extent do existing eddy parameterizations adopted by today s ocean climate models capture eddy behaviors over continental slopes the most widely used approach to parameterizing mesoscale eddies in coarse resolution ocean climate models is a combination of the gent and mcwilliams 1990 gm hereafter scheme which works to flatten isopycnals and release potential energy and the redi 1982 scheme which serves to flux tracers downgradient along isopycnals this approach hinges upon the prescription of the gm and redi eddy transfer coefficients which measure the strengths of adiabatic buoyancy and isopycnal mixing by transient eddies respectively depending on the large scale explicitly resolved flow properties in the quasi geostrophic qg ocean interior the gm transfer coefficient can be approximately related to the redi transfer coefficient abernathey et al 2013 therefore accurate construction of the former may shed light on the latter various schemes have been proposed to construct the gm eddy transfer coefficient using properties of the resolved flow for instance the mixing length theory mlt hereafter prandtl 1925 paradigm formulates the gm transfer coefficient as the product of an eddy length scale and a characteristic eddy velocity or equivalently the product of an inverse eddy time scale and the squared eddy length scale multiplied by a non dimensional prefactor

not necessarily transferable to continental slopes previous studies of cross slope eddy buoyancy transfer have relied principally on the modified qg eady 1949 or phillips 1954 models which predict that the ratio between the bottom slope and the isopycnal slope denoted by the slope parameter δ determines the stability of along slope flows blumsack and gierasch 1972 mechoso 1980 spall 2004

topographic wave propagation flows both the wavelengths and the growth rates of unstable waves decrease as the magnitude of δ increases by contrast for δ 0 corresponding to retrograde i e opposite to the direction of topographic wave propagation flows the linear growth rate instead increases but then drops to zero for δ 1 the linear prediction has proved to be qualitatively useful in interpreting

2013 a theoretical basis for interpreting the variation of nonlinear eddy buoyancy flux with the slope parameter in retrograde fronts remains elusive isachsen 2011 most of the aforementioned studies have also chosen to neglect the influence of topographic canyons ridges on eddy buoyancy transfer across continental slopes however this choice carries certain caveats because topographic canyons ridges were found to be ubiquitous along realistic continental margins see fig 5 of harris and whiteway 2011 for a global distribution of submarine canyons a number of studies have revealed that topographic canyons ridges can substantially enhance the onshore intrusions of mass and physical biogeochemical properties in retrograde slope fronts e g kämpf 2007 allen and hickey 2010 which are directly linked to the arrested topographically trapped waves over canyons ridges zhang and lentz 2017 2018 a paradigm for constructing the gm based eddy transfer coefficient that accounts for the effects of the bottom slope is yet to be developed such a paradigm should incorporate the aforementioned nonlinear eddy characteristics over continental slopes particularly in retrograde fronts where linear predictions proved to be ineffective this article serves as a first step to fill this crucial gap by constructing multiple slope aware and numerically implementable scalings of the depth averaged cross slope eddy buoyancy mixing focusing on the case of flows driven by retrograde wind forcing in the limit of a flat ocean bed most scalings reduce to the formulations that have been tested in previous studies consistent with the findings of harris and whiteway 2011 we also investigate to what extent topographic canyons ridges may impact the proposed scalings for transient eddy buoyancy fluxes the rest of this article is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the model configurations employed in this study compare the key characteristics of wind driven flows over an alongshore uniform slope and over a corrugated slope and highlight the quantitative influence of topographic corrugation on eddy buoyancy transfer in section 3 we propose the scalings for the depth averaged eddy buoyancy mixing across alongshore uniform continental slopes in section 4 we assess the transferability of these scalings to alongshore corrugated slopes discussion and conclusion follow in section 5 2 numerical simulations in this section we describe the model configuration of our simulations illustrate the simulated flow characters and quantify the cross slope eddy buoyancy fluxes all experiments use the mit general circulation model mitgcm hereafter marshall et al 1997 the quantitative performance of which in simulating continental shelf slope eddies has been evaluated in ws18 against an isopycnal coordinate model and a terrain following coordinate model 2 1 reference model configuration the configuration of our reference simulation follows that of ws18 the most salient details of which are reiterated here with reference physical parameters summarized in table 1 we consider a zonal channel with a continental shelf of 500 m depth located at the southern boundary of the domain the shelf is deeper than most realistic continental shelves e g cacchione et al 2002 to ensure that the flow field over the shelf and slope is adequately resolved the ocean depth is 4000 m at the northern boundary and shoals from the center of the domain toward the shelf across an idealized continental slope specifically the bathymetry z h x y is defined by 1 h x y z s 1 2 h s tanh y y s y t sin 2 π x λ t w s where x l x 2 l x 2 is the along slope distance longitude from the domain center y 0 l y is the offshore distance latitude z s 2250 m denotes the slope mid depth h s 3500 m represents the shelf height and w s 50 km is the slope half width the latitude of the center of the continental slope varies longitudinally see fig 1 with mean position y s 200 km wavelength λ t and onshore offshore excursion amplitude y t the channel spans 800 km and 500 km in the along slope and cross slope directions respectively throughout this work we will use along slope and longitudinal or zonal interchangeably and similarly for the cross slope with latitudinal or meridional the channel is posed on an f plane with a coriolis parameter f 0 1 1 0 4 s 1 as changes in depth dominate the background pv gradient and so the slope can be thought of as being oriented in any direction relative to meridians we use a horizontal grid spacing of 2 km and 70 vertical levels with vertical grid spacing increasing from 10 m at the surface to over 100 m at the ocean bed partial grid cells with a minimum non dimensional fraction of 0 1 are used to improve representation of flows over the continental slope griffies et al 2000 simulations conducted at higher 1 km horizontal grid resolution or based on 133 vertical levels yielded no qualitative differences from the results reported below the channel is forced at the surface by a steady alongshore wind stress with a cross shore profile defined by 2 τ x τ o sin 2 y l w 0 y l w here τ o 0 05 n m 2 denotes the maximum strength of wind which coincides with the mean offshore slope position y s 200 km l w 400 km measures for the width of forcing in the offshore direction and the negative sign on the right hand side of 2 corresponds to retrograde i e westward wind stress no surface buoyancy flux is prescribed at the ocean bed the channel is subject to a drag stress with quadratic coefficient c d 2 5 1 0 3 serving as a sink for energy and momentum imparted by the surface wind stress periodic boundary conditions are used in the alongshore direction no normal flow conditions are imposed at the shoreward and offshore edges of the domain the potential temperature is restored to a reference exponential profile across a sponge layer of 50 km width at the northern boundary with a maximum relaxation time scale of 7 days to facilitate the evolution of ocean flow into a statistically steady state this effectively fixes the first baroclinic rossby deformation radius 3 l d h 0 n s d z π f 0 at approximately 18 km in the deep open ocean where n s is the buoyancy frequency the surface k profile parameterization kpp large et al 1994 is used with its default setting for the reference simulation because almost no difference is yielded by replacing the kpp with a large diffusivity of 100 m 2 s for parameterizing convective instabilities all subsequent experiments follow the latter option for computational efficiency in addition an explicit biharmonic viscosity is used for numerical stability 2 2 experiments a suite of experiments are performed by varying the reference settings in section 2 1 specifically we independently adjust the maximum strength of wind the thermal expansion coefficient and importantly the slope geometry for each simulation which are summarized in table 2 we vary these dimensional parameters in such a way as to cover a wide range of continental slope configurations characterized by five non dimensional numbers discussed below and meanwhile avoid redundant runs the wind stress magnitude is quantified by a rossby number defined as 4 r τ τ 0 ρ 0 f 0 2 l w h which is varied between 1 56 1 0 6 and 6 25 1 0 6 corresponding to a wind driven overturning with its strength ranging from 0 25 m 2 s to 1 00 m 2 s per unit channel width and thus resembling those across the margins of mid latitude gyres e g colas et al 2013 and high latitude marginal seas e g manucharyan and isachsen 2019 the stratification off the shelf slope is quantified via the non dimensionalized buoyancy frequency 5 n h 0 n s y l y d z π f 0 h where n s y l y denotes the vertical buoyancy frequency at the northern boundary the first baroclinic rossby deformation radius determined by 5 measures from 12 km through 25 km mimicking the near slope ocean condition at mid high latitudes see e g figs 6 and 8 of chelton et al 1998 the slope steepness is measured by 6 s t h s 2 w s which is varied between 1 75 1 0 2 and 7 00 1 0 2 corresponding to a topographic slope angle ranging from 1 to 4 in the meridional direction consistent with typical slope steepnesses in the ocean e g cacchione et al 2002 the corrugation or roughness of the sloping ocean bed is quantified by the non dimensional alongshore bathymetric wavelength 7 λ 0 λ t 2 w s y t and the depth variation of the slope 8 ϒ max h m min h m h where h m is the height of ocean bed at the mean mid slope position y y s similar parameters to 4 and 8 are defined by brink 2010 to study tidal rectification over continental shelves and slopes in a barotropic ocean the simulations in table 2 are categorized into two groups one based on zonally uniform channels names beginning with smooth and the other characterized by along slope topographic variations names beginning with corrug with finite positive values of y t and λ t in 1 preliminary experimentation reveals that flows in the corrug runs may be affected by the northern sponge layer if the offshore excursions of the continental slope are sufficiently large we therefore expanded the channel width to 600 km while retaining identical relaxation at the northern 50 km wide boundary in all corrug simulations further expansion of the channel width to 800 km yielded negligible differences to the corrug results to facilitate comparison between simulations we partition the corrugated slope domains into southern central and northern slope regions delineated by the latitudes y y s w s y t y s w s y y s w s y s w s and y y s w s y s w s y t respectively as such the central slope region of a zonally uniform channel is also its entire slope region since y t 0 see fig 1 c d the southern and northern slope regions accommodate if any onshore intrusion of canyons and offshore excursion of ridges respectively all model runs integrate the three dimensional hydrostatic boussinesq momentum equations coupled with a linearized equation of state depending on potential temperature only each simulation is spun up from a resting state at a coarse 4 km resolution for 35 years until a statistically steady state is reached as determined from the time series of total kinetic energy the solutions are then interpolated onto a finer 2 km grid and re run for another 15 years to re establish statistical equilibrium daily outputs taken from the final 5 years are analyzed 2 3 simulated flows fig 1 a b illustrate snapshots of sea surface potential temperature color contours along with topographic geometries in the reference simulation smooth reference and in a simulation with a slightly corrugated continental slope corrug 200 λ t 12 5 y t λ t 200 km y t 12 5 km respectively selected isobaths black contours and quasi streamlines 1 1 the time mean surface horizontal velocity fields in our simulations are not exactly divergence free the quasi streamlines are selected contours of the quasi streamfunction calculated as ψ surf x y 0 y u z 0 d y of the time mean horizontal velocity field u h at sea surface white contours are superposed on the potential temperature where denotes a time average over the 5 year long analysis period vigorous eddies are visible in both simulations however while the surface mean flow is almost exactly aligned with the isobaths in fig 1 a standing meanders 2 2 in this article we use the terms standing meanders stationary meanders and standing eddies interchangeably with horizontal scales comparable to the zonal extent of the topographic variations arise and traverse the isobaths in fig 1 b numerous studies have shown that standing meanders in retrograde flows over a corrugated shelf slope result from the arrested pv waves generated by topographic variations allen 1975 wang and mooers 1976 csanady 1978 brink 1986 1991 connolly et al 2014 zhang and lentz 2017 2018 similar to those found in the antarctic circumpolar current over a topographic ridge treguier and mcwilliams 1990 stevens and ivchenko 1997 abernathey and cessi 2014 thompson and naveira garabato 2014 stewart and hogg 2017 accompanying the standing meanders is the lower contrast of potential temperature between the shelf slope and the open ocean suggesting stronger restratification compared to the case shown in fig 1 a in fig 1 c d we quantify the time zonal averages of potential temperature θ and zonal velocity u superposed on the logarithms of time zonal mean eddy kinetic energy eke 1 2 u 2 v 2 per unit mass where 1 l x d x denotes the zonal mean operator and the prime denotes the deviation of a quantity from its time mean eke exhibits similar structures and magnitudes between the simulations however in the presence of standing meanders the retrograde flow is weakened with its maximum strength shifted onshore and the topographically induced prograde flow see ws18 for the interpretation of prograde flow generation where u 0 m s occupies a larger area 2 4 cross slope eddy buoyancy mixing in this study we specifically focus on developing scalings for transient eddy buoyancy fluxes across alongshore uniform continental slopes and then assessing the transferability of these scalings to corrugated continental slopes which induce stronger restratification fig 1 a b and support weaker retrograde flows fig 1 c d for brevity a detailed examination of the dynamics of mesoscale eddies over corrugated continental slopes is deferred to a future study in the smooth simulations the cross slope fluxes can be equivalently defined as those across the meridians or across the isobaths over a corrugated slope however these two types of fluxes differ meridional fluxes at a fixed latitude are determined by flows both over the ridges and within the canyons at the same latitude and represent the deviations from the large scale zonal mean flow this type of fluxes can be readily decomposed into a transient eddy part and a standing eddy part e g bischoff and thompson 2014 however the cross isobath fluxes are confined above certain depths and are directly shaped by the topographic pv gradient this type of fluxes has been previously calculated to study fluid parcel exchanges between the shallow shelves and the open ocean e g brink 2010 2011 gan et al 2009 2013 or restated meridional fluxes may include both cross isobath and along isobath components whereas cross isobath fluxes stress the motions traversing absolute depths there is thus no reason to expect that a single scaling would apply to both types of eddy fluxes over a corrugated slope to illustrate the impact of standing meanders to the cross slope buoyancy transfer by transient eddies we first quantify the depth averaged eddy buoyancy diffusivities in fig 2 as functions of latitude using the meridional transient eddy heat fluxes 3 3 as our simulations employ a linear equation of state depending on the potential temperature only buoyancy flux is proportional to heat flux and we therefore use these two terms interchangeably in this article defined by 9a κ θ f θ h 0 θ y d z 9b f θ h 0 v θ d z the definition 9a 9b avoids ill defined κ θ in well mixed regions by integrating the eddy buoyancy flux f θ and mean buoyancy gradient separately e g jansen et al 2015 across the slope κ θ in the presence of canyons ridges red solid curve ranges from 10 m 2 s at y 150 km to 74 m 2 s at y 250 km and is in general larger than that in the zonally uniform channel for y 168 km blue curve which ranges from 5 m 2 s to 26 m 2 s across the same latitudinal range with its minimum reaching 3 m 2 s at y 163 km the enhanced meridional buoyancy diffusivity produced by corrug 200 λ t 12 5 y t is consistent with the weakened meridional temperature gradient over the shelf slope fig 1 a b we then calculate the buoyancy diffusivity using the cross isobath rather than the meridional heat fluxes 10a κ θ i s o h h 0 f θ i s o n h 0 h θ d z d s h h 0 10b f θ i s o h h 0 h h 0 h 0 u h θ d z d a here h h 0 is a selected isobath h is the horizontal gradient operator n h h h h is the offshore unit normal vector to the isobath d s denotes the infinitesimal arclength along the selected isobath h h 0 and d a denotes an infinitesimal horizontal area although κ θ i s o is defined as a function of h it is mapped onto fig 2 red dashed line as a function of the mean offshore distance of each isobath it should be noted that both 9b and 10b automatically eliminate the rotational component of transient eddy fluxes based on the two dimensional divergence theorem marshall and shutts 1981 fox kemper et al 2003 4 4 it follows from two dimensional divergence theorem that the total eddy flux across the boundary of a control area is equal to the integral of the divergence of eddy flux over this area the rotational component of the eddy flux vanishes via the divergence operator upon area integral in a periodic channel model subject to no normal flow lateral boundary conditions the divergent eddy flux can only traverse the open boundaries defined by isobaths in addition calculation of f θ i s o h h 0 via 10b is far more efficient than using the isobath normal components of the depth integrated eddy fluxes which have to be obtained by interpolating eddy fluxes from the regular model grids onto the lateral location of each isobath the cross isobath flux gradient are exactly identical to the meridional flux gradient for smooth runs the cross isobath buoyancy diffusivity κ θ i s o in corrug 200 λ t 12 5 y t is generally smaller in magnitude than the meridional diffusivity κ θ in either of the simulations shown here over the continental slope 3 scaling cross slope buoyancy mixing our findings in sections 2 3 2 4 suggest that the cross slope buoyancy transfer can be quantitatively modulated by standing eddies for instance standing eddies can drive stronger restratification figs 1 a b and 2 furthermore topographically induced prograde flows which were shown to be associated with upgradient buoyancy fluxes by transient eddies see fig 10 of ws18 tend to be enhanced in the presence of standing eddies fig 1 c d these quantitative differences should be factored into the scaling parameterization of cross slope buoyancy transfer which necessarily incorporate the effects of both transient and standing eddies however there is no basis yet for parameterizing standing eddy fluxes which must be addressed in future work the qualitative behavior of transient eddies such as the surface intensification of eke fig 1 c d nevertheless remain when topographic corrugation is introduced this makes the smooth simulations which carry the advantage of isolating the transient eddy fluxes from the standing meanders a natural starting point for our investigation in this article we focus on the local i e depth averaged cross slope eddy buoyancy mixing shown in fig 2 as a first step toward a more general parameterization these diagnostics integrate the vertical structure of the eddy fluxes which typically serve to restratify the ocean close to the surface but destratify close to the bottom slope ws18 see also appendix a however even the depth averaged eddy diffusivity may still turn negative over portions of the continental slope see fig 2 we note that recently developed parameterizations of eddy transfer in the open ocean are formulated in terms of similar depth averaged diffusivities jansen et al 2015 mak et al 2017 2018 in this section we aim to derive scalings of eddy buoyancy mixing that transition smoothly from zonally uniform continental slopes to open ocean environments and subsequently evaluate the transferability of these scalings to the corrugated continental slopes 3 1 parameter dependence of eddy buoyancy diffusivity to assess the effect of mean retrograde flow properties on the cross slope eddy mixing one has several options to define a parameter space within which three of the non dimensional numbers are arguably the most crucial the local slope parameter 11 δ loc h h h 0 n s 2 d z n h 0 h b d z the local richardson number 12 r i loc h f 0 2 h 0 n s 2 d z n h 0 h b d z 2 and the local slope burger number 13 b u loc h h f 0 h h 0 n s d z where n h h h h is the offshore isobath normal unit vector in the smooth simulations the lateral buoyancy gradient h b is almost exactly aligned with n fig 1 a and we therefore have 14 n h 0 h b d z h 0 h b d z h 0 m 2 d z later in section 4 we extend the definitions 11 12 to the corrug simulations in which the mean flows are no longer parallel to the bathymetry fig 1 b in the modified qg eady 1949 model the slope parameter hinges upon the sign of the lateral pv gradient at the ocean bed which determines the coupling of linear baroclinic modes at the bottom and at the surface vallis 2006 the dynamic meaning of the slope parameter defined by 11 is much less obvious in more general cases where interior pv gradients become finite but previous studies indicate that a quantitative relation between δ loc and cross slope eddy diffusivity still exists e g isachsen 2011 stewart and thompson 2013 the richardson number is an indicator of baroclinicity of the flow and has been used in multiple studies to parameterize eddy buoyancy fluxes e g visbeck et al 1997 marshall et al 2012 bachman and fox kemper 2013 finally recent study of hetland 2017 suggests that the slope burger number is critical in constraining the eddy growth in prograde fronts while its role in retrograde fronts has yet to be determined it should be noted that any two of these non dimensional numbers can be used to approximate the third hetland 2017 15 b u loc r i loc 1 2 h h n s f 0 n s f 0 m 2 h h n s 2 m 2 bottom slope isopycnal slope δ loc we also seek to understand the influences of three dimensional quantities on cross slope eddy mixing the topographic rhines scale 16 l rh u e β t β t f 0 h h h the local eke per horizontal area 1 h h 0 eke d z or equivalently the eddy velocity scale adopted in 16 17 u e 2 h h 0 eke dz and the local eddy potential energy epe per horizontal area aiki et al 2016 18 1 h i 1 n lay 1 epe i 1 h i 1 n lay 1 1 2 ρ 0 g i η i 1 2 2 where the subscript i denotes the counting of isopycnal layers from surface to bottom with its maximum denoted by n lay η i 1 2 is the isopycnal interface between layers i and i 1 and g i g ρ i 1 ρ i ρ 0 stands for the associated reduced gravity the local epe can be calculated either via the layers package in mitgcm e g mak et al 2018 or by converting the diagnostics on a geopotential coordinate system onto isopycnal coordinates following young 2012 in this study we follow the latter approach by selecting a total of n lay 71 isopycnal layers with buoyancy intervals selected based on the prescribed vertical discretization of the buoyancy field in the northern sponge layer previous studies have found these dimensional parameters to be salient in parameterizing eddy effects in the open ocean e g eden and greatbatch 2008 cessi 2008 marshall et al 2012 jansen et al 2015 we diagnose the non dimensional numbers 11 13 the dimensional quantities 16 18 and the cross slope eddy buoyancy diffusivity κ θ in portions of the model domain where the ocean depth lies between 510 m and 3990 m for simulations with widened continental slopes we further constrain the analysis to the region south of y 350 km i e at least 100 km away from the northern sponge layer to avoid the influence of the lateral boundaries and the weak topographic pv gradient β t in nearly flat regions ws18 has shown in their fig 3 that potential energy conversion from eke may occur throughout the water column between y 350 km and 450 km due to the buoyancy restoring at the northern boundary in the reference run these analysis regions aggregated across all smooth simulations yield 1428 latitudinal bands from which to draw diagnostics of 11 13 and 16 18 we then zonally average and plot these parameters against κ θ via gray markers in fig 3 and in appendix b diagnostics made within the continental slope region y y s w s y s w s which are consistently between 938 m and 3568 m depths in our simulations are highlighted using a darker gray tone we stress that although these controlling parameters were coupled in several ways to parameterize baroclinic eddy fluxes in previous studies e g visbeck et al 1997 spall 2004 jansen et al 2015 each of them in isolation does not necessarily have a functional relationship with the eddy diffusivity fig 3 a shows the relationship between the bottom slope steepness relative to the isopycnal slope and the cross slope eddy buoyancy diffusivity consistent with previous studies based on primitive equation simulations e g isachsen 2011 stewart and thompson 2013 cross slope eddy mixing is increasingly suppressed as δ deviates from 0 toward positive values however in contrast to the linear prediction blumsack and gierasch 1972 mechoso 1980 no stabilization of the flow is found for δ 1 in fact the cross slope eddy mixing appears to increase approximately linearly with δ for δ 1 the discrepancy between the linear prediction based on the modified eady 1949 or phillips 1951 model and the non linear model results is mainly due to the lack of interior pv gradient and flow nonlinearity in the former trodahl and isachsen 2018 ghaffari et al 2018 many functional forms could be used to fit the relation between κ θ and δ loc favoring simplicity we use a sum of a linear function and a reciprocal function 19 κ θ γ δ loc 1 φ δ loc γ as illustrated by fig 3 a here γ 2 5 is the estimated slope of the linear functional part φ 5 1 0 2 is a constant that adjusts the decay rate of the reciprocal functional part and γ 1 denotes a positive constant to accommodate the limit δ loc 0 i e nearly flat ocean bed case it should be noted that there is no theoretical basis for the functional fit 19 following previous studies e g stewart and thompson 2013 our approach is entirely empirical the least squares error produced by 19 decreases by a factor of 2 compared to a linear functional fit if diagnostics from both the continental slope and the open ocean regions are accounted for when diagnostics from the continental shelf are also included the relation 19 generates a slightly larger error than a linear fit partly due to the emergence of negative eddy diffusivity and local slope parameter this issue can be fixed by replacing the reciprocal function in 19 with an exponential decay however our key findings reported in later sections do not qualitatively depend on such modifications crucially the mathematically simple form of 19 helps to simplify our analysis contrasted to most other nonlinear functions the eddy diffusivity is then predicted to reach its minimum as δ loc 4 42 o 1 as the ocean bed becomes steeper eddy mixing starts to be constrained by the linear functional part of 19 for δ loc i e zero projection of isopycnal slope in the cross slope direction this simple approximation becomes unbounded we return to this point and discuss potential regularizations for this issue in section 5 fig 3 b exhibits widespread scatter of the local richardson number r i loc against the eddy diffusivity κ θ further examination suggests the relation 20 κ θ γ 1 0 3 r i loc 1 2 with γ varying from 1 to 350 depending on the simulations and geographic locations similar to 19 the relation 20 is empirical selected from many possible nonlinear fits the cases exhibiting weakly negative values of γ are those dominated by eddy destratification which are relatively rare in the smooth simulations see section 4 over continental slopes γ 75 yields a good fit for all simulations with the least squares error smaller than from an optimized linear fit by a factor of approximately 1 85 these results may seem counter intuitive as higher richardson number suggests weaker baroclinicity of the along slope flow and thus lower available potential energy reservoir in the classical eady 1949 model baroclinic mode growth rate is exactly proportional to f 0 r i e g pedlosky 1987 vallis 2006 suggesting an anti correlation between κ θ and r i loc 1 2 if the linear modes govern the eddy mixing existing eddy parameterizations also treat the eady growth rate as a key parameter e g visbeck et al 1997 marshall et al 2012 the relationships between the eddy diffusivity and the other selected parameters 13 and 16 18 are shown in appendix b of the potential controlling parameters explored only the local slope parameter δ loc in isolation exhibits a strong functional relation with the eddy diffusivity in both the continental slope and open ocean environments although the local richardson number r i loc constrains eddy buoyancy fluxes across the continental slope and has been incorporated in existing eddy parameterizations e g visbeck et al 1997 marshall et al 2012 bachman and fox kemper 2013 the eddy buoyancy diffusivity cannot be scaled by r i loc alone in the open ocean environment other parameters in isolation may exhibit functional relationships with the eddy diffusivity in the open ocean but not over the continental slope see appendix b these findings suggests that existing eddy parameterizations may be adaptable to continental slopes via the introduction of a dependence on the local slope parameter as shown in the following sections 3 2 scaling of eddy mixing via the geometric framework the observation that κ θ tends to scale with r i loc 1 2 fig 3 b motivates the application of a recently developed paradigm of eddy parameterization that combines the square root of the richardson number with the total eddy energy namely the geometric framework marshall et al 2012 bachman et al 2017 mak et al 2017 2018 specifically marshall et al 2012 defined 21 κ geom γ geom n s m 2 e γ geom r i f 0 e based on a geometric constraint on the eliassen palm flux tensor in quasi geostrophic flows here γ geom is a non dimensional prefactor whose magnitude is bounded by unity and e denotes the sum of the eke and the epe per unit mass in a coarse resolution ocean model if an additional prognostic equation for the subgrid eddy energy budget is implemented e g mak et al 2018 the only free parameter in 21 is γ geom which contains the information about the partition between the eke and epe and the anisotropy of the eddy buoyancy fluxes marshall et al 2012 it should be noted that the cross slope eddy diffusivity can turn negative even in a depth averaged sense over zonally uniform slopes fig 3 this contradicts other eddy parameterizations that permit vertically local destratification of flows by baroclinic eddies but ensure net potential energy destruction across a full water column e g ferrari et al 2010 this further motivates the application of the geometric framework over steep slopes the coefficient γ geom may become predominantly negative across a water column if the relative orientation of the eddy buoyancy flux to the mean buoyancy gradient is sufficiently small marshall et al 2012 fig 4 a demonstrates the performance of the local geometric scaling 22a κ geom γ r i loc f 0 e loc 22b e loc 1 h h 0 eke d z i 1 n lay 1 epe i in quantifying κ θ over continental slopes here γ γ geom 1 08 1 0 2 is a constant that optimizes the linear fit between the scaling 22a 22b and the diagnosed diffusivities and e loc denotes the depth averaged total eddy energy per unit mass a strong correlation r 2 0 87 is found the prefactor γ 1 08 1 0 2 is smaller than proposed by mak et al 2018 for open ocean applications by a factor of almost 4 reflecting the much less efficient extraction of the mean flow energy via downgradient eddy buoyancy fluxes over steep slopes marshall et al 2012 bachman et al 2017 and the bulk compensation between surface intensified baroclinic instability and bottom trapped eddy destratification ws18 the transition of the local geometric prefactor 23 γ geom κ θ r i loc f 0 e loc from the continental slopes toward the nearly flat regions can be quantified via the local slope parameter and is illustrated in fig 4 b approaching the nearly flat regions the prefactor ranges from 0 to over 0 1 with a median of approximately 0 04 consistent with the values adopted in idealized simulations of the antarctic circumpolar current mak et al 2017 2018 over continental slopes γ geom tends to converge between 0 01 and 0 02 the weakest mixing is found for δ loc between 0 5 and 4 0 a preliminary parameterization of 23 that captures this trend 24a γ geom γ f geom δ loc 24b f geom δ loc ψ tanh γ δ loc 1 δ loc γ is presented in fig 4 b where γ o 1 0 2 denotes a constant coefficient that sets the overall magnitude of the geometric prefactor and f geom is an empirical function that measures the variation of γ geom with δ loc two parameters are defined in f geom and summarized in table 3 ψ 1 35 captures the re scaled geometric prefactor over steep slopes and γ 0 1 controls the asymptotic approach of f geom to ψ for large δ loc and avoids f geom becoming ill defined as δ loc 0 eq 24a is then bounded by γ γ 0 08 i e twice as large as the value used by mak et al 2018 as δ loc 0 and converges to γ ψ 0 01 as δ loc substitution of this parameterization in place of the constant coefficient in 22 yields a closer agreement between κ geom and κ θ with their correlation raised to r 2 0 92 when the diagnostics from the open ocean both the open ocean and the continental shelf are included the diagnosis scaling correlation is r 2 0 61 r 2 0 45 not plotted with a constant prefactor but reaches r 2 0 90 r 2 0 76 with the parameterization 24 as illustrated in fig 5 a following bachman et al 2017 we proceed to investigate whether the predictive power of the geometric scaling subject to a constant prefactor is constrained by differing eddy energy types used in 22b to this end we recalculate κ geom with the total eddy energy e loc in 22a replaced by either the local eke or the local epe fig 4 c d indicates that although both energy types serve to establish positive correlations between the geometric scaling and the diagnosed eddy diffusivity the local epe appears to play a more important role over steep slopes this is in contrast with the finding of bachman et al 2017 that the predictive skill of the geometric formula is independent of the eddy energy type adopted over a flat bottomed ocean 3 3 the cross front scaling of eddy buoyancy transfer we next formulate an alternative scaling for the cross slope eddy buoyancy transfer conventional dimensional arguments suggest that the eddy diffusivity can be defined as the product of a squared length scale and a inverse time scale c f section 1 here we use the topographic rhines scale and the constant coriolis frequency to construct our scaling we stress that these choices are made based entirely on a variety of trials not shown rather than upon any theoretical basis because neither quantity in isolation has a functional relationship with the eddy diffusivity over the continental slope appendix b we further affix a local slope parameter to capture the variation of the eddy diffusivity over steep slopes shown in fig 3 a and define 25 κ cf γ cf δ loc l rh 2 f 0 here γ cf is a non dimensional coefficient and the subscript cf stands for cross front this name was motivated by an alternative writing of 25 26 κ cf δ loc l rh 2 f 0 h h n s 2 m 2 u e β t f 0 f 0 h h h h n s 2 m 2 u e β t β t h n s 2 m 2 u e β t u e n s 2 m 2 h which is a mlt like scaling with the characteristic eddy velocity defined in 17 and the eddy length scale n s 2 m 2 h measuring the horizontal distance required for the tilted isopycnals to span the entire ocean depth the rearrangement 26 suggests that κ cf does not explicitly depend on the topographic steepness but rather on the isopycnal slope if γ cf is defined as a constant the local cf scaling following 26 27 κ cf γ u e h h 0 n s 2 d z h 0 m 2 d z exhibits a strong correlation r 2 0 83 with the diagnosed cross slope eddy diffusivity fig 6 a where γ γ cf 4 1 0 4 has been chosen to optimize the linear fit the correlation reduces to r 2 0 70 if the diagnostics from the open ocean are included and to r 2 0 57 if both the continental shelf and open ocean portions are accounted for not shown which indicates that a constant prefactor is appropriate over steep slopes but unable to make the scaling transition smoothly from slopes toward the more flat regions the transition of the local cf prefactor 28a γ cf κ θ u e h s loc θ 28b s loc θ h 0 m 2 d z h 0 n s 2 d z from the continental slope to the nearly flat regions can be parameterized in terms of δ loc following the approach described in section 3 2 as shown in fig 6 b we propose a functional relation between the cf scaling prefactor and the local slope parameter that is similar to 24 29a γ cf γ f cf δ loc 29b f cf δ loc ψ tanh γ δ loc 1 2 δ loc γ where γ o 1 0 3 is a constant that sets the overall magnitude of γ cf as in 24b the parameters in 29b ψ 0 5 and γ 0 1 are selected to approximate the variation of the empirical function f cf with δ loc see table 3 then it follows that γ cf is bounded by γ γ 8 1 0 3 in the flat bottom limit and converges to γ ψ 4 1 0 4 over steep slopes replacement of the constant coefficient in 27 with the parameterization 29 yields a diagnosis scaling correlation of r 2 0 86 over steep slopes and of r 2 0 91 r 2 0 77 if one includes the diagnostics from the open ocean region both the open ocean and the shelf regions as shown in fig 5 b next we assess which of the variables that constitute the eddy length scale are most crucial in predicting the cross slope eddy diffusivity when γ cf is fixed as a constant in fig 6 c we plot a simplified form of the cf scaling 30 κ cf γ u e z s h 0 n s 2 d z h 0 m 2 d z with which we maintain the spatially varying isopycnal slope but replace the ocean depth h in 27 with the slope mid depth z s table 1 interestingly the diagnosis scaling correlation gets even stronger r 2 0 89 compared to the case with the original local cf form 27 further replacement of the local vertical stratification h 0 n s 2 d z h with the cross slope averaged vertical stratification leads to 31a κ cf γ u e z s n 0 2 1 h h 0 m 2 d z 31b n 0 2 slope 1 h h 0 n s 2 d z d a slope d a where the subscript slope denotes the region over which the integral is performed the modification 31 slightly changes the scatter pattern between the scaling and the diagnosed diffusivity but not the predictive skill of the cf scaling fig 6 d eqs 31a 31b also indicate that the cross slope eddy buoyancy fluxes f θ κ cf 1 h h 0 m 2 d z scale only with the characteristic eddy velocity u e reminiscent of the empirical findings by stewart and thompson 2016 that the eddy thickness fluxes across the antarctic continental margin scale with u e alone see their eq 25 if the isopycnal slope quantity in 27 is substituted by its cross slope average the correlation between κ θ and κ cf is diminished r 2 0 69 not shown maintaining the spatially varying ocean depth and local vertical stratification while replacing the spatially varying horizontal stratification with its cross slope average produces an even lower correlation between the scaling and the diagnosed eddy diffusivity r 2 0 41 not shown implementation of the cf formula over continental slopes for parameterization purposes should therefore preserve the spatial variation of the local isopycnal slope or at least the horizontal stratification we note that 26 resembles the eddy buoyancy transfer coefficient proposed by bachman and fox kemper 2013 32 κ b13 γ r i 0 31 u e n s 2 m 2 h which is diagnosed from a set of eady like spin down simulations see also bachman et al 2017 eq 32 differs from 26 by a factor of r i 0 31 over the continental slope the local richardson number varies between o 10 o 1 0 3 fig 3 b leading to the decrease of the predicted eddy diffusivity via κ b13 by a factor of 2 10 compared to κ cf in fig 7 a we plot the local form of 33 κ b13 γ r i loc 0 31 u e h h 0 n s 2 d z h 0 m 2 d z against κ θ with γ 2 5 1 0 3 chosen to minimize the linear mismatch the correlation r 2 0 59 between the two quantities is much lower than the case shown in fig 6 a by replacing the eddy velocity scale u e in 26 with the mean thermal wind velocity one obtains the eddy transfer coefficient formulated by fox kemper et al 2008 34 κ fk08 γ n s 2 h 2 f 0 which has been implemented to parameterize submesoscale eddy restratification in the mixed layer in global ocean climate models fox kemper et al 2011 as pointed out by bachman et al 2017 κ fk08 does not depend on the eddy energy budget due to its differing definition of the characteristic velocity scale in fig 7 b we compare the local form 35 κ fk08 γ h h 0 n s 2 d z f 0 with κ θ where γ 2 1 0 4 optimizes the linear fit an almost identical correlation r 2 0 59 compared to the case shown in fig 7 a is reached between κ θ and κ fk08 while the weakened correlation between κ b13 and diagnostics sources from the richardson number dependent multiplier in 33 it is mainly the omission of the isopycnal slope quantity i e m 2 n 2 that lowers the predictive skill of 35 3 4 slope dependent mixing length theory although the original form of the cf scaling 25 incorporates the local slope parameter δ loc further transformation 26 frames it as a mlt based scaling that is relatively insensitive to topographic steepness over continental slopes see also fig 6 b it is then natural to ask whether other mlt based eddy parameterizations most of which do not explicitly incorporate topographic effects apply to continental slopes this question is also practical in that modern ocean general circulation models such as the latest version of the modular ocean model mom6 have a set of mlt based eddy parameterizations implemented most of these parameterizations depend on a variety of optional length scales plus a prognostic subgrid eke budget to apply these parameterizations over continental slopes one has to first select the most appropriate eddy length scale 3 4 1 previous mixing length theory based scalings various studies have proposed that the eddy buoyancy transfer coefficient can be parameterized as 36 κ mlt u e l e where u e is drawn from the local eke budget following 17 and l e denotes an eddy length scale to be determined e g eden and greatbatch 2008 cessi 2008 jansen et al 2015 recently jansen et al 2015 has demonstrated that assigning the rhines scale defined via planetary vorticity gradient as the eddy length scale such that 37 κ mlt u e l rh broadly quantifies the eddy buoyancy mixing over a flat bottomed ocean via a suite of idealized simulations see their fig 6 the eddy length scale has previously been defined as the width of the baroclinic zone across which baroclinic eddies were mostly generated e g visbeck et al 1997 bachman and fox kemper 2013 jansen et al 2015 in the context of continental slope one choice for the width of the baroclinic zone is the width of the slope see table 1 i e 38 κ mlt u e w s this formulation has been reported to accurately quantify the cross slope eddy thickness flux in the antarctic slope front stewart and thompson 2016 eden and greatbatch 2008 have advocated to prescribe the eddy length scale not only by the rhines scale but also by the first rossby radius of deformation such that 39 κ mlt u e min l d l rh this approach was motivated by the observation that eddy mixing is more isotropic anisotropic and limited by the deformation radius rhines scale at mid low latitude eden 2007 others have chosen to only use the deformation radius when testing eddy parameterizations e g cessi 2008 eddy growth over a flat bottomed ocean subject to quadratic bottom drag and vanishing pv gradient can also be limited by a frictional scale l f e g jansen et al 2015 leading to 40 κ mlt u e l f l f h e c d where h e denotes the vertical scale of near bottom flow over topography h e can be identified with the prandtl e folding scale e g rhines 1970 treguier and mcwilliams 1990 merryfield and holloway 1999 brink 2016 see also appendix a and is naturally bounded by the ocean depth h i e 41 h e min l j f 0 h h 0 n s d z h where l j l rh stands for the width of near bottom jets and has been defined as the topographic rhines scale consistent with previous studies e g maltrud and vallis 1991 1992 thompson 2010 ws18 eqs 40 41 suggests that the jet width which may represent the scale at which nonlinear eddies equilibrate differs from the frictional scale by a factor of c d n s f 0 which is far less than unity across the regions of our interest with its maximum below 0 08 we thereby speculate that the eddy growth is much less constrained by the frictional scale than by the topographic rhines scale over continental slopes fig 8 a d compares κ θ with the eddy transfer coefficient 36 via different choices for the eddy length scale the correlations are invariably weak or even negative which may have been anticipated as no quantitative trend is revealed between the diagnosed eddy diffusivity and the local topographic rhines scale or the local eke see appendix b it should be noted that the actual application of the scaling 36 as eddy parameterizations also requires the knowledge of the subgrid eke which is not always available in coarse resolution ocean models we therefore assess two additional scalings that are independent of the local eke one developed by visbeck et al 1997 42 κ v97 γ f 0 r i l e 2 γ σ e l e 2 and the other by stone 1972 43 κ s72 γ σ max λ 2 σ σ max here γ denotes the constant coefficient to be determined for each case σ max is the maximum growth rate of linear baroclinic waves and λ σ σ max is the corresponding wavelength eq 42 defines the eddy velocity scale as the product of the eddy length scale l e and the eady growth rate σ e f 0 r i whereas 43 uses the product of the wavelength and growth rate of the most unstable baroclinic linear mode visbeck et al 1997 assigned the width of baroclinic zone as the eddy length scale and found that a constant prefactor γ 0 015 in 42 applied to a range of baroclinic processes over steep slopes however we found no optimal length scale for 42 after a series of tests not shown the topographic rhines scale is thus chosen as a representative case fig 8 e shows that the local form of 42 44 κ v97 γ f 0 r i loc l rh 2 is uncorrelated with the diagnosed diffusivity under the eady 1949 or phillips 1954 model setup κ s72 is equivalent to κ v97 if the deformation radius is used as the eddy length scale since the most unstable mode resulting from the interacting surface and bottom edge waves has fixed wavelength proportional to the deformation radius vallis 2006 in primitive equation simulations however the most unstable baroclinic mode is not necessarily excited by edge wave interactions and its wavelength has to be diagnosed locally in addition lateral shear of the alongshore flow tends to modulate the linear wave characteristics killworth 1980 we therefore conducted a linear stability analysis following the approach detailed in section 4 4 of ws18 to extract the most unstable modes whose wavelength is at least half of the deformation radius at each latitude across the slope region expanding the search range in wavelength does not change the result fig 8 f shows that the stone 1972 scaling is uncorrelated with the diagnosed eddy diffusivity 3 4 2 slope aware mixing length theory based scalings we now adapt these tested mlt based scalings to a sloping ocean bed by utilizing an empirical functional relation between the eddy buoyancy diffusivity and the local slope parameter that is similar to 19 our proposed scaling follows 45 κ mlt γ δ loc 1 δ loc γ u e l e here γ is a constant prefactor and γ 1 can be adjusted so that γ γ reaches the same order of magnitude as the mlt scaling coefficient diagnosed over a flat ocean bed δ loc 0 eq 45 differs from 36 by a factor of δ loc 1 δ loc γ which as we show in the following significantly improves its predictive skill we treat jansen et al s 2015 diagnostics over a flat ocean bed summarized in their fig 6 as a starting point to better frame the order of magnitude of γ in fig 9 a we plot the cross slope eddy diffusivity κ θ against the δ dependent mlt based scaling using the topographic rhines scale 16 and the eddy velocity 17 46a κ mlt γ f mlt δ loc u e l rh 46b f mlt δ loc δ loc 1 δ loc γ where γ 3 3 1 0 3 is selected to optimize the linear fit between κ mlt and κ θ and γ 1 0 1 0 2 simplifies 46 to κ mlt 0 33 u e l rh when δ loc 0 see table 3 the prefactor then reaches the same order of magnitude as that diagnosed by jansen et al 2015 importantly the correlation achieved by κ mlt against κ θ r 2 0 92 is much enhanced compared to the case shown in fig 8 a next we replace the topographic rhines scale in 46 with the slope half width table 1 and plot the redefined κ mlt against κ θ in fig 9 b the prefactor γ 4 0 1 0 4 is again chosen to optimize the diagnosis scaling linear fit which combined with γ 1 0 1 0 2 makes the prefactor asymptote to 4 0 1 0 2 in the flat bottom limit consistent with the value diagnosed by jansen et al 2015 when the baroclinic width was chosen as their eddy mixing length the correlation between κ θ and κ mlt r 2 0 82 slightly drops compared to the case shown in fig 9 a over steep slopes the topographic rhines scale is comparable in magnitude to the first rossby radius of deformation due to the suppressed eddy velocity scale and the increase of topographic pv gradient in fig 9 c we plot the relationship between the slope aware κ mlt with l rh substituted by l d in 46 and the diagnosed eddy diffusivity here γ 1 9 1 0 3 has the same order of magnitude as the prefactor when l rh serves as the mixing length however γ 1 0 1 0 3 makes the full coefficient of κ mlt approach o 1 in the flat bottomed ocean similar to the magnitude diagnosed by jansen et al 2015 the correlation is similarly strong r 2 0 90 as in the case shown in fig 9 a although we expect that the frictional scale to be less relevant over steep slopes adopting l f as the mixing length in 46 and assuming that l j l rh in 41 nevertheless yield a strong correlation between κ mlt and κ θ r 2 0 83 as shown in fig 9 d the prefactor has again been adjusted to optimize the diagnosis scaling linear fit and to account for the magnitude of the mlt based scaling reported by jansen et al 2015 the strong correlation does not imply that the eddy mixing is frictionally controlled over steep slopes but rather that the local buoyancy frequency h 0 n s d z h does not vary significantly the variation is within a factor of 2 across the entire channel leading to l f l rh based on 40 41 fig 9 a d indicates that the scaling 45 is insensitive to the eddy length scale chosen over steep slopes as long as the eddy velocity scale u e is used implementation of 45 should therefore prioritize the optimal mixing length scale that makes the scaling transition smoothly from the slope toward the open ocean if the diagnostics from the open ocean both the shelf and the open ocean are included in the comparison the correlation of the rhines scale based κ mlt 46 with the diagnosed diffusivity reduces to r 2 0 79 r 2 0 65 as shown in fig 5 c defining the frictional length scale which is partly dependent on the topographic rhines scale as the mixing length in 45 slightly modifies the diagnosis scaling correlation the correlation coefficient is r 2 0 71 if the open ocean is included and r 2 0 52 if both the shelf and the open ocean are included not shown in contrast neither the deformation radius nor the slope half width produces a diagnosis scaling correlation better than r 2 0 06 if the open ocean diagnostics are included our findings therefore suggest that the rhines scale is the most suitable choice for the eddy mixing length mirroring findings of jansen et al 2015 in the context of a flat bottomed ocean in fig 9 e f we also test the slope aware forms of the local visbeck et al 1997 scaling 47 κ v97 γ f mlt f 0 r i loc l rh 2 and the local stone 1972 scaling 48 κ s72 γ f mlt σ max λ 2 σ σ max these formulations do not show significant improvements in predictive skill compared to their slope unaware counterparts our findings suggest that accurate implementation of the mlt based scaling for steep slopes depends crucially on the subgrid eke budget 4 impact of along slope topographic variations sections 3 2 3 4 suggest that eddy buoyancy mixing across continental slopes can be reproduced via the geometric scaling the cf scaling or the δ dependent mlt based scaling that incorporates the eddy velocity scale u e and the topographic rhines scale l rh while both the geometric scaling and the cf scaling are able to quantify the eddy transfer across steep slopes with suitably chosen constant prefactors they require δ dependent prefactors to transition from the slope to the open ocean in this section we investigate the extent to which these slope aware scaling frameworks apply to continental slopes featuring topographic canyons and ridges over which standing meanders lead to stronger restratification and the topographically induced prograde flows tend to penetrate to the upper ocean c f section 2 3 4 1 meridional vs cross isobath eddy mixing in the context of corrugated continental slope we face a choice as whether to compare the scalings with the eddy buoyancy diffusivity directed across meridians 9a or across isobaths 10a to address this we first assess the functional dependence of eddy diffusivity on the two most crucial non dimensional parameters over steep slopes the local slope parameter and the local richardson number c f section 3 1 there is some freedom in defining these two parameters in the presence of canyons ridges because the mean geostrophic currents do not follow the isobaths fig 1 b one choice would be to completely neglect the zonal variations in the topography and mean flow and define these two parameters via the meridional components of the mean buoyancy and bathymetry gradients however the resulting δ loc and r i loc exhibit no correlation with the meridional eddy buoyancy transfer not shown instead we use the local slope parameter and the local richardson number defined by 11 and 12 respectively that is we ignore the cross isobath part of the mean flow and assume that the eddy buoyancy transfer either in the meridional direction or in the cross isobath direction is determined by the along isobath component of the large scale geostrophic current in fig 10 a we compare the zonally averaged slope parameter δ loc with the meridional eddy buoyancy diffusivity κ θ diagnostics have been drawn from three zonal regions across the channel i the region peripheral to the northern southern slope regions with ocean depths between 510 m and 3990 m and lying south of y 450 km ii the northern southern slope regions and iii the central slope region diagnostics from these regions have been plotted with light gray dark gray and blue markers respectively κ θ exhibits a much more scattered relationship with δ loc than in the smooth runs shown in fig 3 a the simple δ function fit 19 becomes limited in characterizing the variation of meridional mixing across corrugated slopes strongly negative diffusivities of o 100 m 2 s emerge on the peripheries of the continental slope and slightly negative eddy diffusivity with negative values of δ loc is found in the northern southern slope regions the negative values of δ loc are due to stationary recirculations residing over topographic ridges in fig 10 b we plot the cross isobath eddy diffusivity κ θ i s o defined by 10a against the local slope parameter averaged along isobaths 49 δ loc h h 0 δ loc d s d s here denotes the along isobath mean operator and the line integral operator is performed where h h 0 diagnostics from the shelf and open ocean regions defined by h 510 m 938 m and h 3568 m 3990 m respectively are plotted with light gray markers whereas the slope region defined by h 938 m 3568 m are plotted with blue markers our simulations show that the cross isobath eddy diffusivity is in general smaller in magnitude than the meridional one consistent with the example shown in fig 2 in addition the cross isobath eddy diffusivity appears to be better fit by our empirically derived function of δ loc 19 than the meridional eddy diffusivity indicating that the local slope parameter defined by 11 mainly constrains the cross isobath rather than meridional component of transient eddy buoyancy fluxes in fig 10 c and d we compare the relationship between the local richardson number and the eddy diffusivity under a zonal vs along isobath average respectively over corrugated slopes the local richardson number reaches o 1 0 2 o 1 0 7 due to the stronger restratification and thus weaker baroclinic shear of the flow the along isobath average calculation produces a better fit between the square root of the local richardson number 50 r i loc h h 0 r i loc d s d s and the eddy diffusivity κ θ i s o than that produced by the zonal average calculation 4 2 scaling cross isobath mixing over corrugated slopes in this section we evaluate the predictive skills of the scalings proposed in sections 3 2 3 4 over corrugated slopes we compare these scalings under an along isobath average because our diagnostics in fig 10 indicate that the local eddy diffusivity has stronger functional relationships with the local slope parameter and the local richardson number under an along isobath average than under a zonal average because the local slope parameter varies even along the isobaths of a corrugated slope due to the presence of standing eddies the δ dependent prefactors for these scalings are preserved from section 3 before the along isobath averages are made fig 11 a shows the relationship between κ θ i s o and the slope aware geometric scaling 51 κ geom topo γ f geom δ loc r i loc f 0 e loc in which the empirical function f geom is identical to 24b see table 3 for selected values of parameters in f geom and γ 1 02 1 0 2 is a constant chosen to optimize the linear fit between κ geom topo and κ θ i s o the diagnosis scaling correlation r 2 0 67 is smaller than for the case of zonally uniform slopes r 2 0 92 a fraction of diagnosed diffusivities such as those produced by corrug 200 λ t 12 5 y t highlighted with red markers and corrug 400 λ t 50 y t highlighted with blue markers are particularly poorly captured by 51 negative values of κ geom topo in corrug 400 λ t 50 y t indicates the presence of locally prograde fronts i e δ loc 0 associated with standing meanders in fig 11 b we investigate the factors that contribute to the diversion of diagnosed eddy diffusivity from the theoretical prediction by plotting the diagnosed geometric prefactor against the local slope parameter as in fig 4 b this plot shows that the empirical relation between γ geom and δ loc in the smooth simulations approximately applies to the corrug simulations however as the ocean bed becomes steeper the diagnosed prefactor exhibits more scatter in the corrug simulations than in the smooth simulations specifically for δ loc 10 the diagnosed geometric prefactor ranges between 0 94 1 84 in the smooth simulations but between 0 06 1 87 in the corrug simulations in fig 11 c we plot κ θ i s o against the slope aware cf scaling 52 κ cf topo γ f cf δ loc u e h h 0 n s 2 d z n h 0 h b d z in which n h h h h f cf is identical to 29b see table 3 for selected values of parameters in f cf and γ 8 9 1 0 4 is selected to optimize the linear fit the diagnosis scaling correlation r 2 0 73 is slightly stronger than that in fig 11 a but remains weaker than for the case of zonally uniform slopes r 2 0 86 as in the geometric case the weaker agreement between the diagnosed diffusivity and the scaling 52 shown in fig 11 c is partly due to the outlying results from corrug 200 λ t 12 5 y t and corrug 400 λ t 50 y t in fig 11 d we contrast κ θ i s o against the slope aware mlt based scaling 53 κ mlt topo γ f mlt δ loc u e l rh in which f mlt is identical to 46b see table 3 for selected value of parameter in f mlt and γ 4 6 1 0 3 optimizes the linear fit the diagnosis scaling correlation r 2 0 72 is comparable to those produced by the geometric and the cf scalings the weaker agreement between the diagnosed diffusivity and the scaling 53 contrasted to the smooth case r 2 0 92 is again partly attributed to the outlying results from corrug 200 λ t 12 5 y t and corrug 400 λ t 50 y t 4 3 cross slope averaged scaling of cross slope eddy mixing in the flat bottomed ocean context jansen et al 2015 proposed a parameterization using the bulk averaged eddy mixing over an entire baroclinic zone rather than using horizontally local properties this approach may also be favored over continental slopes as topographic corrugation leads to increased scatter of the diagnosed eddy diffusivity against the scalings proposed in this study see fig 11 in addition ws18 have shown that the eddy energy transfer becomes non local e g chen et al 2014 across steep slopes and any closure of the subgrid eddy energy from which the eddy velocity is provided based on the local production dissipation balance e g cessi 2008 may become inaccurate in fig 12 we plot the diagnosed cross isobath eddy diffusivity κ θ i s o against the three slope aware scalings after averaging over the continental slope regions defined by ocean depths in the range h 938 m 3568 m where denotes the bulk area mean operator diagnostics from both the smooth black markers and the corrug blue markers simulations are included all three scalings produce strong correlations r 2 0 80 with the diagnosed diffusivity across our suite of simulations the bulk eddy transfer coefficients in the smooth simulations are particularly closely reproduced with correlations exceeding r 2 0 89 and reaching r 2 0 98 for the mlt case 5 discussion and conclusion accurate representation of mesoscale eddy effects in coarse resolution ocean climate models remains a pressing challenge for the oceanographic community mid latitude mesoscale eddies over continental slopes in particular cannot be resolved even in eddy permitting global ocean models hallberg 2013 existing approaches of eddy parameterization have mostly been developed based on the open ocean turbulent properties and are thus independent of the bottom topography which may lead to incorrect water mass formations and adjustment of ocean general circulations over continental slopes in this article we have examined three numerically implementable scalings for eddy buoyancy transfer across retrograde slope fronts the geometric scaling originally developed by marshall et al 2012 a new cross front scaling derived via dimensional analysis and the mixing length theory mtl based scaling prandtl 1925 we demonstrate that both the geometric framework and the cf scaling are capable of quantifying the eddy diffusivity over the continental slope in isolation following the selection of suitable constant prefactor coefficients however in order to capture the eddy mixing across both the continental slope and the open ocean all three scaling approaches require the insertion of a prefactor that depends on the slope parameter δ we have shown that by making the prefactor a simple analytical function of the local slope parameter each of these scalings is able to reproduce the depth averaged eddy mixing over the slope and in the open ocean c f fig 5 however over continental shelves the eddy transfer coefficients are much less well captured by these scalings the reason for this is unclear and must be addressed in future work based on the studies focusing on continental shelves e g brink 2016 it should be noted that the continental shelves in our simulations are set to be unrealistically deep in order to isolate the cross slope eddy fluxes and therefore may have limited applicability to cross shelf eddy fluxes table 3 summarizes our proposed slope aware scalings with parameter values chosen based on our cross slope averaged calculation fig 12 which maximizes the agreements between the scalings and the diagnosed eddy diffusivity the prefactor for both the geometric framework and the cf scaling can be constructed as the sum of a sigmoid function e g hyperbolic tangent in this study and a decay function e g reciprocal function in this study of the local slope parameter which converge to empirical constants over the flat ocean bed and over steep slopes for mlt based scaling we propose a linear function of δ loc combined with a decay function however this function becomes unbounded if the isopycnals are completely flat over the slope i e δ loc for numerical implementation purposes one can fix this issue by replacing the linear function with a nonlinear one that asymptotes to an empirical constant or decay to zero when the slope parameter crosses a threshold value it should be noted that the sign of each slope aware scaling depends not only on the sign of the local slope parameter but also on the specific functional form of its prefactor a scaling designed for retrograde front i e δ loc 0 may thus stay positive when the slope parameter turns negative see fig 11 this issue can be addressed by adding a switch like heaviside function of δ loc that shuts down the mixing across a retrograde front when δ loc turns negative in the context of buoyancy driven prograde front i e δ loc 0 spall 2004 has previously proposed a slope dependent scaling for the eddy heat flux 54 v θ e 2 δ loc u tw δ θ where δ θ denotes the temperature or buoyancy difference across the front whose spatial span can be approximated by the slope width the scaling 54 was constructed to fit the analytical solution of eddy heat fluxes produced by the modified eady 1949 model blumsack and gierasch 1972 further rearrangement of 54 leads to 55 κ θ e 2 δ loc u tw w s which constitutes a mlt based scaling posed in terms of the thermal wind velocity and the width of the slope spall s 2004 results combined with our findings complement existing eddy parameterizations by incorporating the leading order effects of bottom topography the substantially differing dynamics induced by bottomcanyons ridges limits the applicability of the slope aware scalings developed based on eddy dynamics over zonally uniform slopes for instance our proposed scalings conceal the vertical structure of eddy mixing which may substantially impact the along slope flow in the presence of topographic corrugations this is reflected in fig 1 c d even slight bottom corrugation tends to expand the region occupied by topographically induced prograde flows notwithstanding these issues our recommended slope aware scalings produce much stronger correlations with the diagnosed cross isobath eddy diffusivity over corrugated slopes compared with those between the topography independent eddy parameterizations and diagnosed eddy transfer coefficients over zonally uniform slopes this indicates that adaption of existing eddy parameterizations via the δ functions is a promising avenue for future model development efforts parameterizing standing eddy effects over large scale topographic features remain an open challenge in physical oceanography though our scalings do not predict the standing eddy component of cross slope buoyancy flux they constitute a significant step toward parameterizing the transient component of cross slope buoyancy mixing and thus should be tested as parameterizations in coarse resolution models it is particularly important to investigate whether a coarse resolution model that can resolve large scale bathymetric variations but not transient eddy generation will be able to represent the standing eddy buoyancy fluxes across continental slopes such an investigation may be more pertinent to eddy permitting global ocean models e g uchida et al 2017 indeed for typical ipcc class earth system models with horizontal grid spacing of 1 or coarser even the continental shelf slope itself may be unresolved if eddy permitting models can indeed reproduce standing eddy fluxes a parameterization of the transient eddy buoyancy flux would be the only part that is required to represent the mesoscale to convert our proposed scalings into full closures of transient eddy buoyancy fluxes a priori knowledge of the eke or the total eddy energy is required modern ocean general circulation models such as the mom6 are increasingly maintaining prognostic subgrid eke or total eddy energy budgets e g jansen et al 2019 mak et al 2018 these models will serve as a natural starting point for testing slope aware eddy parameterizations however caution must taken given that most subgrid eddy energy budgets only reflect open ocean eddy properties over continental slopes lateral eke fluxes via anomalous pressure work are dominant in the upper ocean and eke tends to be converted into potential energy near the ocean bed ws18 both of which remain poorly constrained by existing eddy parameterizations e g eden and greatbatch 2008 maltrud and holloway 2008 5 5 maltrud and holloway 2008 and related work have proposed to implement a biharmonic or laplacian viscosity that forces a mean prograde flow along the isobaths of a continental slope thus ensembling the eddy rectified flow character however this approach is not energetically constrained in addition parameterization of eddy energy dissipation near topographic features remains a challenging research topic even for the well studied open ocean e g yang et al 2018 to accurately apply our proposed scalings existing formulations of subgrid eke budgets may need to be adapted to steep continental slopes though the slope aware scalings exhibit remarkable skill in quantifying the depth averaged cross slope eddy buoyancy transfer our idealized model configuration carries several caveats for instance we did not consider the effects of external buoyancy forcing which can considerably modulate the structure of slope fronts e g stewart and thompson 2013 time dependent wind forcing can also project onto mesoscale variability over steep slopes e g zhai and greatbatch 2007 renault et al 2016 and the evolution to equilibrium may be substantially modulated by eddy memory sinha and abernathey 2016 manucharyan et al 2017 manucharyan and isachsen 2019 tidal flows which have been completely neglected in this study may play a critical role in shaping the shelf break fronts brink 2012 2013 our study has focused on the cross slope eddy buoyancy transfer and it remains unclear how closely this is related to the isopycnal eddy mixing redi 1982 in the context of a flat bottomed ocean abernathey et al 2013 derived an analytical relation their eq 24 between the gm and the redi eddy transfer coefficients the merits of this relation in inferring the isopycnal diffusivity via the gm transfer coefficient particularly over continental slopes have yet to be investigated all these issues remain to be addressed in future investigations

simulations mixing is surface intensified and eddies are found to flux buoyancy up gradient approaching the sloping ocean bed the negative buoyancy diffusivity mirrors the formation of prograde flows

approximated by the topographic rhines scale the exact locations of sign reversal of buoyancy diffusivity do not follow a clear trend with the normalized height but are generally within π l e from the sloping ocean bed appendix b additional parameter dependence of eddy buoyancy diffusivity the relation between b u loc and κ θ is illustrated in fig 14 a the eddy diffusivity rapidly decreases as the slope burger number increases from 0 over continental slopes however κ θ is rather insensitive to b u loc these can be understood via the relationships of δ loc and r i loc to the cross slope eddy diffusivity in the nearly flat bottomed ocean we have κ θ γ 1 δ loc 1 fig 3 a and κ θ γ 2 1 0 3 r i loc 1 2 fig 3 b where γ 1 50 and γ 2 1 350 then 15 leads to κ θ 1 0 3 4 50 γ 2 1 2 b u loc 1 2 in fig 14 a we plot the corresponding functional fit for γ 2 1 γ 2 350 in solid dashed line which captures the rapid decay of eddy mixing with the slope burger number as the ocean bed becomes steeper we have κ θ γ 1 δ loc fig 3 a and κ θ γ 2 1 0 3 r i loc 1 2 fig 3 b then 15 gives b u loc 0 95 for γ 1 2 5 and γ 2 75 which provides no information about the eddy diffusivity that is the eddy diffusivity is almost independent of the slope burger number over steep slopes in retrograde fronts fig 14 b contrasts the topographic rhines scale l rh with the cross slope eddy diffusivity we fit a weakly quadratic relation which produces a least squares error slightly smaller than that generated by an optimized linear fit by a factor of approximately 1 2 when diagnostics from the continental slope and the open ocean are considered the quadratic approximation is no better than a linear fit when the continental shelf is also included over the continental slope alone no clear correlation between the two quantities is found comparing κ θ against the first rossby radius of deformation or the rhines scale normalized by the deformation radius does not yield further insight not shown we plot the depth averaged eke and epe against the eddy diffusivity in fig 14 d and e respectively the two energy reservoirs are roughly equipartitioned with the local epe slightly higher the local eke the strength of the cross slope eddy mixing does not seem to be controlled by the amount of eddy energy alone indeed over continental slopes κ θ is generally below 120 m 2 s while neither the eke nor the epe are generally lower than that in regions away from the slope
