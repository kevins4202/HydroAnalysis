21530,a subsystem of a large compliant floating hydrocarbon storage facility fhsf is established as a simplified model to validate its hydrodynamic performance the subsystem is composed of two floating hydrocarbon storage tanks floating tanks placed in a large moonpool of a rigid barge frame the barge frame is expected to serve as a breakwater as well as a protection to the floating tanks the wave induced responses of the subsystem with the existence of moonpool gaps are investigated through experimental and numerical studies the experimental studies followed a froude scaling ratio 1 45 were conducted in an ocean basin under various wave conditions corresponding to nearshore environments both free surface elevations in the moonpool gaps and the hydrodynamic responses of the three floating bodies were obtained besides a numerical model based on linear potential flow theory is developed and a dipole lid is introduced to incorporate the viscous effect on the resonant free surface motions comparable experimental and numerical results show that the free surface elevations in the moonpool gaps can be reasonably predicted next four different configurations of the subsystem were investigated and different hydrodynamic coupling behaviors between the fluid resonant motions the motions of the barge frame and the floating tanks are revealed it is demonstrated that the motions of the floating bodies and the resonant fluid motions in the narrow gaps are the smallest in the oblique sea the present study provides a useful reference for the design and hydrodynamic analysis of floating multi body systems for nearshore applications keywords ocean space utilization floating structure multi body hydrodynamics side by side fluid resonance 1 introduction ocean space utilization helps coastal cities and island based countries to create land space to fight against problems due to sea level rise in coastal areas where environmental conditions are relatively calm and water depth is shallow large floating structures lfss can be easily deployed there have been various applications of lfss such as floating oil storage base ueda 2015 floating solar farms dai et al 2020 etc these lfss can be categorized into continuous lfss and modular lfss the latter has the advantage that the hydrodynamic loads on the structure are reduced significantly however the large hydrodynamic loads on the connections of modular lfss may be a problem to address this problem the idea of compliant design can be introduced from the design of offshore platforms this can be achieved by restraining the modules of lfss by soft mooring lines since the modules of lfss compliantly move to environmental actions it is expected that the hydrodynamic loads on both structures and connections can reduce significantly recently this compliant design is applied to a floating hydrocarbon storage facility fhsf as shown in fig 1 in the fhsf 14 floating hydrocarbon storage tanks denoted as floating tanks below with two different maximum storage capacities are placed in proximity to each other and connected through a specially designed soft mooring system under the present design each floating tank can move independently in 6 degrees of freedom d o f compliantly to incident waves besides an articulated floating barge system is introduced the floating barge system is consisted of 25 rigid barges with interconnections and is a frame like structure with large moonpools the barge system is restrained by eight mooring dolphins which ensure the barge frame to move compliantly in heave the barge system serves as not only a protection for the single hull floating tank from the potential risk of ship collision but also breakwaters to reduce the wave excitations in the moonpool this practical arrangement is believed to be new to the best of the author s knowledge since the floating tanks and the floating barges are modular designs this system can be easily expanded more details on the fhsf can be found in zhang et al 2020 the present design applies to an 18 m coastal water depth site on this site the operational sea state has a significant wave height hs 1 0 m and a peak period tp 5s and the extreme sea state has a hs 1 8 m and tp 7s the wave spectrum of both sea states is the jonswap spectrum since the fhsf is a new concept verifying its hydrodynamic performance under incident water waves is of high importance in the authors previous study a promising hydrostatic and hydrodynamic performance of a single floating tank has been verified dai et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b however when a large number of floating tanks are assembled into a multibody system the hydrodynamic interactions among the floating barges and the floating tanks become complicated due to the complexity of the system see fig 1 it is well known that the hydrodynamic responses of the conventional lfs either continuous or modular may be evaluated through the hydroelastic method efficiently watanabe et al 2004 however the fhsf has more d o f than the conventional lfs because the floating tanks and the barge frame are softly connected in addition internal tank sloshing modes and free surface resonant motions in the gaps between the modules may induce strong hydrodynamic interactions a simplified numerical model may neglect important effects therefore a multi body hydrodynamic analysis is essential for a floating multi body system with a limited number of bodies many studies focused on the hydrodynamic interactions and mechanical couplings for example kim 1972 and ohkusu 1976 revealed the importance of hydrodynamic interactions between two ships following their studies kodan 1984 and fang and kim 1986 explored the motions of adjacent floating structures in oblique waves koo and kim 2005 compared the cases with and without the consideration of the hydrodynamic interactions of two side by side floating platforms it was found that neglecting hydrodynamic interactions may lead to a significant discrepancy in the motions of both platforms meanwhile to consider the mechanical couplings langley 1984 presented a general dynamic analysis method for floating multibody systems sun et al 2011 introduced the lagrange multiplier to solve the dynamic responses of float over installations as for the well known side by side floating liquefied natural gas flng and lng carrier lngc system connected through hawsers and fenders pessoa et al 2015 developed a linearized coupled model in the frequency domain which showed fairly good accuracy compared to experimental results recent research done by zhao et al 2018a presented a time domain analysis to investigate the hydrodynamic interactions between flng and lngc in their comprehensive work the coupling between sloshing and vessels motion and the effect of the connection system consisted of fenders and hawsers were presented the above research works were mostly based on linear potential theory however the nonlinear effect may contribute to the dynamic responses of the floating multibody system pessoa et al 2016 revealed that the second order wave excitations are important for the side by side floating system based on a fully nonlinear potential theory feng and bai 2017 developed a numerical model of two floating barges with and without connections the contribution of nonlinearities was found significant under a steeper wave condition in addition to the research on the interactions of floating bodies attention has also been paid to fluid resonances in the narrow gaps fluid resonant motions may occur when the incident wave frequency is close to natural frequencies of fluid resonant mode in narrow gaps and moonpools this phenomenon was identified clearly in experimental studies molin et al 2009 perić and swan 2015 yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2018b an analytical solution on the mode shape and corresponding natural frequencies in both narrow gaps and moonpools under infinite and finite water depth were derived by molin 2001 and molin et al 2018 respectively the existence of gap resonances may influence hydrodynamic forces on the two floating bodies as illustrated in lu et al 2011 and jiang et al 2019 kristiansen and faltinsen 2010 investigated the strong hydrodynamic couplings between the resonant piston mode in a narrow gap and the motions of a ship in shallow water the potential flow method tends to unphysically overestimate fluid resonances since the viscous effects are neglected computational fluid dynamic cfd method may be directly utilized to predict gap resonant motions yang et al 2018 or combined with potential flow models chua et al 2017 2018 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 however no existing research papers have been found applying cfd to the large floating multibody system because of the high computational cost instead potential flow theory is still favored for hydrodynamic analysis of a multibody system to overcome the problem in the framework of potential flow theory a rigid gap lid may be introduced to reduce the free surface oscillation buchner et al 2001 a flexible gap lid with generalized mode was developed by newman 2003 meanwhile chen 2005 introduced a free surface dissipation term on the free surface boundary condition recently a new method was implemented by lee and zhu 2018 to model viscous effects in resonant free surface motions through a dipole lid this method will be adopted in this paper these methods can effectively reduce unrealistic resonant free surface elevations although experimental results are still needed to tune the free surface dissipation factor compared to the research focusing on side by side floating systems the hydrodynamic interactions and mechanical couplings in a floating system with more than two bodies were less investigated lu et al 2010 investigated a three body system with three gaps in a two dimensional numerical wave tank ning et al 2018 reported the difference between a mono box and an equivalent tandem floating box system with narrow gaps in two dimensional cases we may note that the three dimensional effects may have a significant influence on a complex floating multibody system for a large array of floaters the wave structure interactions may be calculated with analytical or semi analytical solutions kagemoto and yue 1986 newman 2001 when the large array of floaters is the substructure of vlfs numerical methods with proper approximations can further accelerate the computations murai et al 1999 these methods were applied to floating structures in simple geometries recent research work was presented by otto et al 2020 on a floating mega island consisted of interconnected triangular pontoons the side length of a single module can be more than 250 m their numerical and experimental results demonstrated that the external region of the island has the worst dynamic responses it is also noted that the gap between the modules is only 7 m which is near negligible compared to the large dimension of the modules other floating multibody systems are frequently seen as floating wave energy converters wecs since wecs are characterized by specific dynamic behaviors aimed at extracting wave energy and designed to work under resonant conditions the related research is not reviewed here the literature review shows that the published research work with a focus on the hydrodynamics of floating systems with more than two bodies is few not to mention a complex floating system with 35 bodies in shallow water conditions in addition very few experimental results are available for the validation of a complex floating multi body system because of these gaps and the difficulties a decomposed strategy is adopted for hydrodynamic analysis of the fhsf which starts from an intermediate and simple subsystem see fig 3 this subsystem consists of two floating tanks and a surrounding barge frame the hydrodynamic analysis of the subsystem becomes more affordable for both experimental and numerical studies since the subsystem contains the major characteristics of the fhsf observations from this system can help to understand the hydrodynamic behaviors of the complex entire system especially the couplings among the floating modules also the subsystem can be treated as the outermost part of the fhsf the research on a modular lfs showed that the outermost modules appear to have maximum hydrodynamic responses ren et al 2019 therefore the observations from the subsystem may also qualify the conceptual design of the entire fhsf the present paper investigates the multi body hydrodynamic responses for the subsystem of fhsf with narrow gaps the main objective is to identify the hydrodynamic interactions between the floating bodies and the resonant fluid motions for the complex multi body system under various configurations which is rarely seen in the literature another objective of this paper is to verify the practical configuration of combining the floating breakwater with floating tanks extensive ocean basin experiments were conducted under various loading conditions wave headings and environmental conditions a linear potential flow theory based numerical model with a high order boundary element method hobem is established and a dipole damping lid is implemented to reduce resonant free surface elevations to a realistic level good agreement between the numerical and experimental results demonstrates that the potential flow panel method can be used to accurately predict the motion responses of the subsystem the analysis of the experimental and numerical results demonstrates the different patterns of hydrodynamic interactions in different configurations acquired knowledge may be a useful reference to the design of other coastal or even deep water floating multi body systems the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present the details of the fhsf subsystem a description of the experimental setup of the subsystem is introduced in section 3 and a numerical method based on linear potential theory is described in section 4 a description of the numerical model and validation of the dipole lid method are presented in section 5 these are followed by the comparisons between experimental and numerical results in section 6 finally the main conclusions and potential future work will be presented in section 7 2 the subsystem of the floating hydrocarbon storage facility the subsystem of the fhsf for validating study consists of a barge frame formed by four rigidly interconnected floating barges and two floating tanks with a storage capacity of 12500 m3 the enclosed barges form a frame like structure with a large moonpool it is called floating barge frame in the moonpool the two floating tanks are placed side by side with a 15 m gap the gap between the floating tanks and the barge frame is about 5 m herein we adopted froude number scaling law with a length scale factor of 1 45 and the corresponding time scale and force scale will be 1 45 and 1 45 3 respectively an articulated bridge is designed between the two floating tanks above the deck of the barge frame it has no contribution to either the structure or hydrodynamics in the present study the barge frame is moored with dolphins and moves only in heave pitch and roll with the existence of the two floating tanks the moonpool is now of irregular shape composed of various narrow gap regions as for the station keeping system the barge frame is restrained by 4 mooring dolphins at its four corners this is similar to the design in the fhsf except that 8 mooring dolphins are designed in the entire system a specially designed soft mooring system composed of 8 mooring lines is proposed to restrain the motion of floating tanks this mooring system links the floating tanks to the barge frame and works in any loading condition of the floating tanks these mooring lines are pre tensioned to prevent any of the mooring lines going slack and ensure that the floating tank and the barge frame will not collide even if one mooring line breaks the detailed layout of the mooring system can be found in the next section with a compliant design the two floating tanks can move in 6 d o f in the moonpool with the natural frequencies of motions in surge and sway outside the wave frequency range due to the complexity of the mooring system its equivalent global stiffness needs to be derived the equivalent stiffness in surge and sway is demonstrated here firstly the mooring force on the i th mooring line f m i can be expressed by the product of its stiffness k m i and its stretch as follows f m i k m i r i r i where r i is the vector pointing from the anchor point on the barge frame to the fairlead point on the floating tanks at a neutral position and r i the vector pointing from the anchor point on the barge frame to the fairlead point on the floating tanks at the new position this force may be decomposed into components in x and y direction the former is expressed as f x i f m i cos θ i f m i r i u r i u where θ i is the angle between r i and unit vector u in the x direction forces in the y direction will balance with each other due to the symmetry of the system next the equivalent global mooring stiffness k x can be determined k x i 1 8 f x i x where x is the displacement of the floating tanks in the x direction the equivalent global stiffness in sway and yaw can be derived similarly these equivalent global stiffnesses of the mooring system are plotted in fig 2 the mooring system behaves noticeably linear this is partly because of the assumption of constant stiffness of a single mooring line which is valid in this case since the floating tank can only move in a limited range where the stiffness variation of a single rope is expected to be small the main particulars of the three bodies and their inertia properties in the prototype are listed in table 1 table 2 table 3 and table 4 respectively the moments of inertia are calculated about their respective centers of gravity cog and the vertical cog is measured from the keel of the floating tank or barge frame the fhsf allows the floating tanks to store different hydrocarbon products under various loading conditions at the same time in the hydrodynamic study three loading conditions are defined based on the volume of stored hydrocarbon products in the tank 0 empty 20 partially loaded and 100 fully loaded of the design storage capacity the dynamic responses are expected to be larger in the empty condition than the other conditions as found in the previous study on a single floating tank under the design sea states wan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b therefore only the empty condition is discussed in this paper 3 experimental setup of the subsystem the experiments on the fhsf are divided into three phases focusing on a single floating tank supported by mooring fenders phase 1 the subsystem phase 2 and the entire fhsf phase 3 respectively to carry out the validation study we focus on the subsystem for more information on phase 1 and phase 3 refer to zhang et al 2019a and fonseca et al 2019 the experiments in phase 2 were undertaken in the ocean basin at sintef ocean the ocean basin has a plan area of 80 m by 60 m and its water depth was adjusted to 0 40 m to model a full scale water depth 18 m there are a double hinged wavemaker and a passive artificial beach on the opposite two ends of the basin the latter can absorb waves effectively giving a reflection of less than 10 fig 3 a and b show the detailed model test setup in the basin and a cross section view of the subsystem respectively the physical models in the basin are shown in fig 3 c the models were placed in the center of the basin 35 26 m from the wavemaker and 23 05 m away from the sidewall the dimensions and mass properties of the models are listed in table 1 to table 4 for ease of comparison to their prototype it is worth noting that the thin plates on the bottom slab see fig 3 d help reduce the motions of the floating tank as found in zhang et al 2019a b fig 3 b also shows four right handed coordinate systems defined in the model test one global coordinate system oxyz three local coordinate systems for three floating bodies the global coordinate system oxyz is fixed to the ocean basin and overlaps with the local coordinate system of the barge frame in still water the local coordinate system for the barge frame is defined at its mean position in still water and the origin is in the center of the water plane the x axes of the local and global coordinate systems are opposite to the wave propagation directions see fig 3 a and the z axes are pointing upwards from the mean free surface a similar definition is applied to the local coordinate systems for both floating tanks these coordinate systems are used in numerical models as well the station keeping system namely the soft mooring system and mooring dolphins were modeled in the test the mooring system was modeled by a group of linear springs in the tests see fig 3 c and e the stiffness of these mooring lines was scaled providing an equivalent horizontal stiffness of 1180 kn m the anchor points on the barge frame and the adjustable fairlead point on the tank wall were both 2 m above the mean water surface the detailed locations of these points were illustrated in fig 3 a the four mooring dolphins were fixed to the bottom of the basin each mooring dolphin was made of a steel tube and a red box see fig 3 a it was found that this design will introduce a stiffness of 1 0e9 kn m which is large enough to restrain the motions of the barge frame all these reported values are in full scale unless otherwise specified various key parameters were recorded through calibrated sensors the motions of the floating tanks and the barge frame were tracked by the qualisys oqus motion tracking system free surface elevations η t in the narrow gaps were measured by five resistance wave probes a single probe was made of two parallel stainless steel rods see fig 3 e these probes were mounted on the barge frame and their locations can be found in fig 3 a the recorded surface elevation was then transferred to the absolute free surface elevation referring to the global coordinate during post processing in addition two reference wave probes were set in the front and besides of the subsystem to monitor the wave fields several force transducers were used to measure forces on the mooring dolphins and tension forces on selected mooring lines see fig 3 e the accelerations of the two floating tanks were also measured to capture possible impact event the measurements from these sensors were synchronized with the incident waves with an output sampling frequency of 20 hz various combinations of loading conditions wave conditions and wave directions were explored in the model test etc the four cases selected for the analysis in this paper are listed in table 5 the different wave headings were achieved by rotating the model in the basin various wave conditions were tested however in this paper we focus on the white noise tests that provide the response amplitude operators raos of 6 d o f motions of the three bodies free surface elevations etc the significant wave height hs of the white noise is 2 m with the wave period varying from 4s to 20s 0 314 rad s to 1 57 rad s the white noise was calibrated without the presence of the subsystem the calibrated wave groups in the center of the subsystem are taken as the incident waves η in the comparison between the incident white noise spectrum and its target spectrum is shown in fig 4 which shows a very good agreement 4 numerical methodology the three dimensional linear potential flow theory is adopted in the numerical model applying potential flow panel method for wave structure interactions can be consulted in faltinsen 1993 therefore only a summary is presented here for completeness based on the inviscid irrotational and impressible assumption the velocity potential φ satisfies the governing laplace equation 2 φ 0 a complex velocity potential φ can be defined from φ re φ e i ω t where re is the real part ω is the incident wave frequency and t is time based on the linear assumption φ may be separated into radiation potentials j 1 n φ j incident wave potential φ i scattering potential φ s as expressed below φ φ i φ s j 1 n φ j where j stands for different modes of motion for an n body floating multibody system the radiation potential will include 6 n components assuming each body has 6 d o f motions it is noted that the sum of φ i and φ s is known as the diffraction potential φ d with the boundary conditions on the seabed wetted body surfaces the free surface and the radiation condition of outgoing waves in the far field a complete boundary value problem is defined the free surface boundary condition is linear to solve the problem green s theorem can be applied to derive integral equations in the boundaries for both radiation and diffraction problems respectively 2 π φ j x s b φ j ξ g n ξ d ξ s b n j g x ξ d ξ 2 π φ d x s b φ d ξ g n ξ d ξ 4 π φ i x here g ξ x is the green function in finite water depth and it is the velocity potential at point x induced by a source 4 π at point ξ s b is the wetted body surface the integral equations may be discretized over the mean wetted body surfaces using b splines basis functions this method is known as a high order boundary element method hobem the hobem is proven efficient and accurate lee and newman 2013 to simulate the thin plates on the bottom slab dipole elements may be introduced in the numerical model refer to lee and newman 2013 for more details in addition to introduce damping in the free surface resonant motions due to viscous effect which are neglected in potential flow a dipole plate may serve as a damping porous surface and can be placed anywhere in the fluid domain the boundary conditions over the dipole surface s d applies δ φ i ε ω φ n where ε is the damping coefficient an assumption has been undertaken that the pressure jump across the dipole surface is proportional to the normal velocity of the fluid the integral equations over the dipole damping plate are given as follows 2 π φ x s b φ g n ξ d s ξ i ω s d ε φ n ξ g n ξ d s ξ s b φ n ξ g d s ξ for field point x on sb 4 π φ n x s b φ g n ξ n x d s ξ i ω s d ε φ n ξ g n ξ n x d s ξ s b φ n ξ g n x d s ξ for field point x on the dipole surface sd once the velocity potential is solved the free surface elevation η can be solved by the dynamic free surface boundary condition below η 1 g φ t z 0 the added mass a i j potential damping b i j and the wave excitation forces f i on the body can be obtained from the equations below respectively a i j i ω b i j ρ s b n i φ j d s f i i ω ρ s b n i φ d d

added mass matrix b ext is the external damping matrix and b ω the potential damping matrix c is the hydrostatic restoring force and moment matrix and c ext is the external stiffness matrix contributed from the mooring system x ω and f ω are the displacement vector and the wave excitation force and moment vector 5 numerical model the numerical model is built in wamit v7 3 in full scale using the same definition of the coordinate system as in the experiment the high order patches of the numerical models are shown in fig 5 a b respectively the thin patches in light blue on the barge frame are the dipole plates to tune the resonant fluid motions to a realistic level consistent with the experiment the width of these dipole plates is 2 m the chosen damping coefficient for dipole plates will be discussed in section 6 to clarify the light blue patches on the floating tank is to simulate the thin plates on the bottom slab in total 112 subpanels of 32 patches are used to describe a single floating tank and 144 subpanels of 36 patches are used to describe the barge frame cubic b splines are used to describe all these patches to properly model the mooring system of the floating tank the soft mooring system is introduced through a linear restoring matrix this is suitable due to the linear property of the mooring system as discussed in section 2 since the motions of the barge frame are assumed small due to its large inertia the anchor points on the barge frame may be assumed as fixed in addition the influence of the mooring system in heave for the floating tanks is small therefore the mechanical coupling is simplified to the coupling between the surge and pitch of the floating tank the coupling term in the restoring matrix can be calculated as below k 15 k 51 k x z k 14 k 41 k y z where z is the vertical distance from the fairlead point to the origin of the local coordinate of the floating tank which is 2 m k y is the equivalent mooring stiffness in y direction k 15 k 51 k 14 and k 41 are the additional elements in the restoring matrix induced by mechanical coupling generally they can be denoted as k i j where the subscript stands for the stiffness in the ith mode induced by the jth mode of motion in the numerical analysis 180 frequencies between 0 4 rad s to 1 6 rad s are covered to capture the resonant phenomenon precisely in addition to account for the viscous effect 8 3 of the critical damping is introduced in pitch and roll 7 5 of the critical damping in heave is introduced to account for the damping effect induced by the thin plates those damping factors were estimated and linearized based on decay test results following the same procedure as in zhang et al 2019a b to reduce the unrealistic potential flow free surface motions in the gaps at near resonance frequencies a linear damping coefficient is introduced in the numerical model through dipole damping lids an iteration procedure was adopted to properly determine the damping coefficient by varying it from 0 to 0 5 with an increment of 0 1 case 1 the barge frame alone under 90 deg wave heading is selected for this study fig 6 shows the experimental and numerical raos of the free surface elevation for probe w11 located at the center of the barge frame see fig 3 the incident wave direction is also shown in the figure for ease of understanding several peaks corresponding to resonant mode trapped in the moonpool of the barge frame is evident the numerical method shows good accuracy in terms of the resonant frequencies but with damping coefficient 0 0 it overestimates the peak value significantly by increasing the damping coefficient it can be found that the free surface elevation can be effectively reduced a damping coefficient 0 5 provides the most ideal results where very good agreement can be found between the numerical and experimental results at almost all the resonant modes the good agreement indicates that the viscous effect on fluid resonances may be well captured by a simple dipole lid placed at the sharp corners unless specified the damping coefficient 0 5 is used for all cases discussed in the paper below 6 results and discussion following the validated numerical results of case 1 the hydrodynamic responses and couplings between the barge frame and the fluid resonances will be demonstrated the motions of the floating tanks in case 2 4 will be presented with a focus on the hydrodynamic couplings between the motions of the floating tanks and the barge frame and the fluid resonant motions 6 1 hydrodynamic responses of the barge frame in case 1 barge frame alone the motion raos of the barge frame alone in heave and roll and 90 wave heading case 1 are plotted in fig 7 a b the wave direction is shown by a schematic drawing in fig 7 a for ease of understanding this applies to the first graph in all the figures of raos hereafter in general the motions are very mild under all the investigated wave frequencies besides there exist several canceling frequencies on the raos in both heave and roll the canceling frequency occurs mainly due to the cancellation of excitation forces moments acting on the two side barges perpendicular to the direction of incident waves to illustrate the influence of fluid resonances on the dynamic responses of the barge frame fig 7 also compares the numerical raos with different free surface damping coefficients against the experimental results for all the remaining frequencies a very good agreement can be found between experimental and numerical results irrelevant to the damping factor exaggerated peaks can be found in both heave and roll at 1 19 rad s and one additional peak in the roll rao can be found at around 1 03 rad s when no damping is introduced this implies that there is a significant coupling between the fluid resonances and the motions of the barge frame fig 8 a d show the raos of the free surface elevations for wave probes w08 w11 locations of these wave probes can be found in fig 3 a special case with a fixed barge frame is analyzed in the numerical model to help identify the couplings between the motions of the barge frame and the fluid resonant motions the results for this case are denoted as bgffix the natural frequencies of resonant modes can be identified from these figures table 6 summarizes those natural frequencies for a moving barge case 1 it can be found that all these modes are accurately predicted in the numerical model table 7 compares the natural frequencies for the fixed barge case to the analytical formula derived by molin et al 2018 for fluid resonances in a moonpool again very good agreement is found between the analytical solutions and the numerical results in general the difference is within 1 except for mode 1 and mode 2 the difference is suspected to be caused by the shallow water effect since these two frequencies are quite low no piston mode is identified for the present case by comparing the results between the moving barge and the fixed barge case two major differences can be observed firstly a shift of certain fluid resonant peaks around 0 80 rad s and 1 03 rad s can be found when the barge frame is free to move in heave and roll specifically mode 1 shifts to 0 795 rad s compared to 0 838 rad s in the fixed barge frame case see fig 6 at 0 795 rad s the heave rao also presents a peak in addition a mode at 0 997 rad s shift to 1 035 rad s the latter is associated with the peak in the roll raos of the barge frame these reveal a strong coupling between motions of the barge frame and certain sloshing modes all the remaining sloshing modes tend to be less coupled to the motion of the barge frame mainly because the motion of the barge frame is near zero at these frequencies to further illustrate the coupling effect fig 9 compares the raos of free surface elevation in the entire free surface for the fixed barge frame and the moving barge frame in these figures x and y denote the coordinate of the free surface points it can be seen that the raos of the free surface are changed due to the motions of the barge frame in general the resonant fluid motion tends to be milder when the barge frame moves a similar shift of fluid resonant frequency due to the motion of a floating body with a moonpool was reported by mciver 2005 subsequently fredriksen et al 2015 confirmed that the resonant frequency of the piston mode in a moonpool will shift to the natural frequency of the floating structure the present results confirm that the fluid resonant frequency of certain resonant sloshing modes will also shift to the peak frequencies of the motions of the floating structure two more interesting findings are observed from these results firstly one additional resonant peak can be identified at 1 190 rad s on the raos of free surface elevations when the barge frame moves in heave and roll this frequency is associated with the peaks in the raos of the barge frame s motions the exaggerated peaks in fig 7 fig 10 c and d show the raos of free surface elevations in the entire free surface in the moonpool and surrounding the barge frame under wave frequency 1 190 rad s the mode shape is difficult to identify however the mode in the interior free surface is attributed to the coupling between the motion of the barge frame secondly a peak can be found at 1 138 rad s on the raos of free surface elevations in both the fixed and moving barge frame cases the raos of free surface elevation under this frequency are plotted in fig 10 a and b a different rao pattern can be found in the moonpool the latter tends to be a combination of mode 2 in the x direction and mode 4 in the y direction this may be caused by the additional radiation waves induced by the barge frame s motions these two observations again clearly show the coupling between the motions of the barge frame and the sloshing modes in the moonpool 6 2 hydrodynamic interactions in case 2 and case 3 the side by side and tandem configuration of the subsystem the fluid resonant motions and the hydrodynamic responses of the subsystem in the side by side configuration 0 deg wave heading and the tandem configuration 90 deg wave heading are investigated fig 11 a d show the raos of the free surface elevations for wave probes w08 w11 w10 and w12 the raos of the free surface elevations for the barge frame alone are plotted for comparison green dot curve a fairly good agreement can be found between the numerical and experimental results compared to those when the barge frame is fixed a clear shift can be found in the raos of the free surface elevation for w08 and w10 in addition the magnitudes of the raos of the free surface elevations are significantly influenced by the existence of the floating tanks for example the rao is enlarged by around two times for w12 between 0 85 rad s and 1 15 rad s it also has a much broader bandwidth so we cannot identify any modes in this range in contrast the rao for w10 is much smaller than that of w12 with a two times reduction between 0 6 rad s and 1 0 rad s the differences can be explained by the shielding effect induced by the floating tanks when the two floating tanks are placed in tandem 90 wave heading the raos of the free surface elevation for probe w08 and w12 are illustrated in fig 12 the raos at the other locations are much smaller than those in the side by side configuration because of the shielding effect thus they are not plotted good agreement is again found between the numerical and experimental results for the tandem configuration it seems the resonances are more severe under a wave frequency around 1 02 rad s where the maximum raos peak can be larger than 3 5 fig 13 shows the raos of the barge frame in heave and pitch and the raos of the barge frame alone are plotted for comparison in case 2 near canceling points can also be found in both heave and pitch comparable to that in the case of the barge frame alone the influence of hydrodynamic interactions on the raos of the barge frame tends to be marginal outside the range between 0 75 rad s and 1 20 rad s this may be because the long waves can easily transmit both the barge frame and the floating tanks in a shallow draft while the shorter waves are reflected by the barge frame this can also be supported by the fact that there is no obvious resonant peak in the raos of the free surface elevations see fig 11 on the contrary a noticeable fluctuation in the motion raos of the barge frame can be found between 0 75 and 1 2 rad s where both heave and pitch of the barge frame are reduced significantly because there is no obvious motion of the floating tanks see fig 13 the reduction is suspected to be at least partly caused by fluid resonances which are exaggerated in this range in general the raos of the barge frame signals the effect of strong hydrodynamic couplings in the present system in fig 14 the raos in 6 d o f of the two floating tanks in side by side configuration are illustrated where the floating tank 1 is denoted as tnk1 and floating tank 2 is denoted as tnk2 respectively see fig 3 the agreement between the numerical and experimental results is quite good in all the 6 d o f motions due to the symmetry of the subsystem the motions of the two floating tanks are identical in general all these raos reduce to a negligible level when the wave frequency is higher than 1 20 rad s furthermore the natural period in surge is larger than 16s and the natural period in pitch is about 10 2s both are far away from the operational hs 1 m tp 5 0 s and extreme hs 1 8 m tp 7 0 s sea states these imply that the wave frequency responses of the floating tanks should be mild it supports that the present compliant design works efficiently on reducing the wave frequency hydrodynamic responses of the subsystem in addition noticeable motions in sway and roll can be identified even in head sea conditions due to the hydrodynamic interactions for example in roll raos a peak exists at around 0 85 rad s which is related to the same peak on the free surface elevations for w11 see fig 11 c they can be of the same magnitude as the motions in surge and pitch and they are strongly coupled with the fluid resonant motions this type of hydrodynamic responses should be carefully considered in the design of a floating multibody system the raos of barge frame s motions in heave and roll and the raos of 6 d o f motions of the floating tanks in the tandem configuration case 3 are plotted in fig 15 and fig 16 respectively if we compare the raos in heave to those in the side by side configuration see fig 14 it can be found the heaving amplitude of the upstream floating tank increases to around 1 5 times that of the downstream floating tank at 0 65 rad s there is no significant fluid resonance in this range so this reduction can be explained by the shielding effect however there appears a different trend in the motions of floating tanks in sway and roll when the wave frequency is lower than 0 67 rad s for example at 0 63 rad s the experimental raos in the roll of the downstream floating tank is about 1 6 times larger than that of the upstream floating tank the numerical results show an over prediction of the raos in roll of the downstream floating tank at around 0 63 rad s natural period in roll the overprediction in the numerical model is suspected to be caused by the different viscous damping effects if we compare the raos in roll to those in pitch in case 2 see fig 14 c it can be found that the upstream floating tank has a much smaller rao at wave frequency around 0 63 rad s while the downstream floating tank has a comparable raos since 0 63 rad s is the natural frequency of roll and pitch motion it suggests that the upstream floating tank experiences larger damping forces in the tandem configuration the larger damping force may be induced by the large fluid resonance in the gap in the numerical model we apply the same damping factor to both floating tanks and this causes the discrepancies the underprediction of the raos in roll when ω 0 55 rad s tends to be similar to those found in zhang et al 2019a b and may be due to the nonlinearities in the experiment further study is needed in the future to further understand the fluid resonant motions and its coupling with the motion of the floating bodies the free surface elevations in the gaps and surrounding the barge frame are calculated based on the validated numerical models the results for the side by side configuration and the tandem configuration are plotted in fig 17 and fig 18 respectively in fig 17 a no resonance can be found in the fluid field when the wave frequency is around 0 616 rad s although the raos of floating tanks motions in both pitch and roll fig 14 d e show a peak this suggests that the resonant motions of the floating tank have a marginal influence on the fluid resonant motions fig 17 b is the raos at the frequency of 0 873 rad s there exists a resonant peak between the two floating tanks and a smaller resonant peak near the front corner of the barge frame while the raos are near zero between the floating tank and the side barge this can cause pressure difference which can induce transverse motions sway and roll of the floating tanks in fig 17 c we can also observe a large peak near the front inner corners of the barge frame with an rao larger than 3 0 and a second peak near the back inner corner of the barge frame this explains the peak in surge raos at around 1 050 rad s these results demonstrate the strong coupling between the fluid resonant motions and the motions of the floating tanks fig 17 d shows the magnitude of raos of free surface elevations at wave frequency 1 257 rad s where no resonant motion can be found it indicates that the present design may not experience serious resonant fluid motions in the operational sea state in the tandem configuration no significant resonant peak can be identified in long waves as in the side by side configuration for example in waves with frequency 0 616 rad s see fig 18 a however significantly different patterns of free surface motion can be found in fig 18 c when there exist strong fluid resonances at wave frequency 1 013 rad s three resonant peaks can be found in the front gap and two side gaps between the upstream floating tank and the barge frame however the raos of the free surface elevations around the downstream floating tank is near zero these findings on the one hand alert that the fluid resonant motions should be carefully considered when designing a similar floating system on the other hand they suggest that the influence of fluid resonant motions around the downstream floating bodies may not be significant at certain frequencies furthermore it is also identified that the diffracted wave may cause a large runup along the front side of the barge for both side by side and tandem configurations the barge needs to be designed with a sufficient freeboard to avoid overtopping water including nonlinear effects 6 3 hydrodynamic interactions in case 4 the subsystem in oblique seas it is also interesting to find out if the strong hydrodynamic interactions and free surface resonance identified for the other two wave headings could be different in oblique seas 45 deg wave heading fig 19 shows the experimental and numerical raos of the free surface elevation for different wave probes the frequencies of resonant modes are consistent with those in figs 8 and 11 this suggests that the natural frequencies of the resonant modes are not sensitive to wave headings however a significant reduction appears in the amplitude of the raos from over 3 5 to less than 2 0 compared to those in case 2 and case 3 the raos of the motions of the barge frame and the two floating tanks also show a significant reduction in the oblique seas which are illustrated in fig 20 and fig 21 respectively a surprising finding is that the rao of the barge frame s motion in heave is near zero for the wave frequencies larger than 1 0 rad s and it is only about half of those in the side by side and tandem configuration for the remaining frequencies see figs 12 and 17 a similar reduction can be found in its roll motion although the heave rao of the tank 1 increases compared to the side by side configuration it is still smaller than that in the tandem configuration the hydrodynamic couplings still exist in the subsystem but tend to be less significant for example the coupling between fluid resonant motion and sway is similar to that in the tandem configuration as shown in fig 21 b in general the hydrodynamic responses of the barge frame and the floating tanks and the fluid resonances tend to be much more moderate even in long waves under this wave heading therefore small wave frequency responses of the subsystem are expected in the realistic sea states these results also suggest that it may be possible to avoid large fluid resonant motions and responses of the floating bodies by proper orientation of a floating system to principle wave directions 7 conclusions hydrodynamic interactions for a subsystem of a novel fhsf are investigated through experimental and numerical analysis the subsystem consists of two floating hydrocarbon storage tanks and a barge frame and it models some of the major characteristics of the entire fhsf comparisons between numerical and experimental results are performed for 4 representative cases barge frame alone in 90 deg barge together with the two tanks in side by side 0 deg and tandem 90 deg configurations and an oblique sea condition 45 deg the investigation focuses on the fluid resonances in the narrow gaps and the hydrodynamic interactions in the subsystem the major findings are summarized as follows from the study of the side by side configuration 0 deg complex hydrodynamic interactions are observed between the resonant free surface motions the motions of the floating tanks and the motions of the barge frame the resonant free surface motions are found to be coupled to the sway and roll motion of the two floating tanks the magnitude of the motions in sway and roll can reach the same level as in surge and pitch even in 0 waves therefore it is concluded that hydrodynamic couplings should be carefully considered the conclusion is useful when designing a similar multibody floating system for example a multimodule lfs with relatively large gaps in the tandem configuration 90 deg a different resonant free surface behavior was observed which only occurs at the region close to the upstream floating tank shielding effects were found by the fact that the heaving motion of the upstream floating tank can be 1 5 times that of the downstream tank a contrary trend is found in roll and sway where the downstream floating tank shows larger motion at its resonant frequency the numerical results show a discrepancy with the experimental results especially in roll which suggests that the applied damping coefficient in roll should be larger for the upstream tank than for the downstream tank these findings suggest that for a tandem floating system the upstream body may not always show larger motion one last configuration when the subsystem is under 45 deg wave excitations the hydrodynamic responses of the barge frame and the floating tanks are found moderate even in long waves it may be associated with the effectiveness of the barge frame on reflecting the incident waves that can cause resonance therefore adjusting the direction of the floating system may be a potential solution to reduce both the resonant free surface motion and motions of the floating system in shallow water coastal areas finally it is noted that the raos of the floating bodies motion are all mild in the frequency range of the design sea states however the realistic hydrodynamic performance of the floating system needs to be carefully checked especially when there exist second order excitations therefore planned future work consists of conducting an extended hydrodynamic analysis on the performance of the subsystem and the entire system in the operational and extreme sea conditions credit authorship contribution statement chi zhang

21530,a subsystem of a large compliant floating hydrocarbon storage facility fhsf is established as a simplified model to validate its hydrodynamic performance the subsystem is composed of two floating hydrocarbon storage tanks floating tanks placed in a large moonpool of a rigid barge frame the barge frame is expected to serve as a breakwater as well as a protection to the floating tanks the wave induced responses of the subsystem with the existence of moonpool gaps are investigated through experimental and numerical studies the experimental studies followed a froude scaling ratio 1 45 were conducted in an ocean basin under various wave conditions corresponding to nearshore environments both free surface elevations in the moonpool gaps and the hydrodynamic responses of the three floating bodies were obtained besides a numerical model based on linear potential flow theory is developed and a dipole lid is introduced to incorporate the viscous effect on the resonant free surface motions comparable experimental and numerical results show that the free surface elevations in the moonpool gaps can be reasonably predicted next four different configurations of the subsystem were investigated and different hydrodynamic coupling behaviors between the fluid resonant motions the motions of the barge frame and the floating tanks are revealed it is demonstrated that the motions of the floating bodies and the resonant fluid motions in the narrow gaps are the smallest in the oblique sea the present study provides a useful reference for the design and hydrodynamic analysis of floating multi body systems for nearshore applications keywords ocean space utilization floating structure multi body hydrodynamics side by side fluid resonance 1 introduction ocean space utilization helps coastal cities and island based countries to create land space to fight against problems due to sea level rise in coastal areas where environmental conditions are relatively calm and water depth is shallow large floating structures lfss can be easily deployed there have been various applications of lfss such as floating oil storage base ueda 2015 floating solar farms dai et al 2020 etc these lfss can be categorized into continuous lfss and modular lfss the latter has the advantage that the hydrodynamic loads on the structure are reduced significantly however the large hydrodynamic loads on the connections of modular lfss may be a problem to address this problem the idea of compliant design can be introduced from the design of offshore platforms this can be achieved by restraining the modules of lfss by soft mooring lines since the modules of lfss compliantly move to environmental actions it is expected that the hydrodynamic loads on both structures and connections can reduce significantly recently this compliant design is applied to a floating hydrocarbon storage facility fhsf as shown in fig 1 in the fhsf 14 floating hydrocarbon storage tanks denoted as floating tanks below with two different maximum storage capacities are placed in proximity to each other and connected through a specially designed soft mooring system under the present design each floating tank can move independently in 6 degrees of freedom d o f compliantly to incident waves besides an articulated floating barge system is introduced the floating barge system is consisted of 25 rigid barges with interconnections and is a frame like structure with large moonpools the barge system is restrained by eight mooring dolphins which ensure the barge frame to move compliantly in heave the barge system serves as not only a protection for the single hull floating tank from the potential risk of ship collision but also breakwaters to reduce the wave excitations in the moonpool this practical arrangement is believed to be new to the best of the author s knowledge since the floating tanks and the floating barges are modular designs this system can be easily expanded more details on the fhsf can be found in zhang et al 2020 the present design applies to an 18 m coastal water depth site on this site the operational sea state has a significant wave height hs 1 0 m and a peak period tp 5s and the extreme sea state has a hs 1 8 m and tp 7s the wave spectrum of both sea states is the jonswap spectrum since the fhsf is a new concept verifying its hydrodynamic performance under incident water waves is of high importance in the authors previous study a promising hydrostatic and hydrodynamic performance of a single floating tank has been verified dai et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b however when a large number of floating tanks are assembled into a multibody system the hydrodynamic interactions among the floating barges and the floating tanks become complicated due to the complexity of the system see fig 1 it is well known that the hydrodynamic responses of the conventional lfs either continuous or modular may be evaluated through the hydroelastic method efficiently watanabe et al 2004 however the fhsf has more d o f than the conventional lfs because the floating tanks and the barge frame are softly connected in addition internal tank sloshing modes and free surface resonant motions in the gaps between the modules may induce strong hydrodynamic interactions a simplified numerical model may neglect important effects therefore a multi body hydrodynamic analysis is essential for a floating multi body system with a limited number of bodies many studies focused on the hydrodynamic interactions and mechanical couplings for example kim 1972 and ohkusu 1976 revealed the importance of hydrodynamic interactions between two ships following their studies kodan 1984 and fang and kim 1986 explored the motions of adjacent floating structures in oblique waves koo and kim 2005 compared the cases with and without the consideration of the hydrodynamic interactions of two side by side floating platforms it was found that neglecting hydrodynamic interactions may lead to a significant discrepancy in the motions of both platforms meanwhile to consider the mechanical couplings langley 1984 presented a general dynamic analysis method for floating multibody systems sun et al 2011 introduced the lagrange multiplier to solve the dynamic responses of float over installations as for the well known side by side floating liquefied natural gas flng and lng carrier lngc system connected through hawsers and fenders pessoa et al 2015 developed a linearized coupled model in the frequency domain which showed fairly good accuracy compared to experimental results recent research done by zhao et al 2018a presented a time domain analysis to investigate the hydrodynamic interactions between flng and lngc in their comprehensive work the coupling between sloshing and vessels motion and the effect of the connection system consisted of fenders and hawsers were presented the above research works were mostly based on linear potential theory however the nonlinear effect may contribute to the dynamic responses of the floating multibody system pessoa et al 2016 revealed that the second order wave excitations are important for the side by side floating system based on a fully nonlinear potential theory feng and bai 2017 developed a numerical model of two floating barges with and without connections the contribution of nonlinearities was found significant under a steeper wave condition in addition to the research on the interactions of floating bodies attention has also been paid to fluid resonances in the narrow gaps fluid resonant motions may occur when the incident wave frequency is close to natural frequencies of fluid resonant mode in narrow gaps and moonpools this phenomenon was identified clearly in experimental studies molin et al 2009 perić and swan 2015 yang et al 2019 zhao et al 2018b an analytical solution on the mode shape and corresponding natural frequencies in both narrow gaps and moonpools under infinite and finite water depth were derived by molin 2001 and molin et al 2018 respectively the existence of gap resonances may influence hydrodynamic forces on the two floating bodies as illustrated in lu et al 2011 and jiang et al 2019 kristiansen and faltinsen 2010 investigated the strong hydrodynamic couplings between the resonant piston mode in a narrow gap and the motions of a ship in shallow water the potential flow method tends to unphysically overestimate fluid resonances since the viscous effects are neglected computational fluid dynamic cfd method may be directly utilized to predict gap resonant motions yang et al 2018 or combined with potential flow models chua et al 2017 2018 kristiansen and faltinsen 2012 however no existing research papers have been found applying cfd to the large floating multibody system because of the high computational cost instead potential flow theory is still favored for hydrodynamic analysis of a multibody system to overcome the problem in the framework of potential flow theory a rigid gap lid may be introduced to reduce the free surface oscillation buchner et al 2001 a flexible gap lid with generalized mode was developed by newman 2003 meanwhile chen 2005 introduced a free surface dissipation term on the free surface boundary condition recently a new method was implemented by lee and zhu 2018 to model viscous effects in resonant free surface motions through a dipole lid this method will be adopted in this paper these methods can effectively reduce unrealistic resonant free surface elevations although experimental results are still needed to tune the free surface dissipation factor compared to the research focusing on side by side floating systems the hydrodynamic interactions and mechanical couplings in a floating system with more than two bodies were less investigated lu et al 2010 investigated a three body system with three gaps in a two dimensional numerical wave tank ning et al 2018 reported the difference between a mono box and an equivalent tandem floating box system with narrow gaps in two dimensional cases we may note that the three dimensional effects may have a significant influence on a complex floating multibody system for a large array of floaters the wave structure interactions may be calculated with analytical or semi analytical solutions kagemoto and yue 1986 newman 2001 when the large array of floaters is the substructure of vlfs numerical methods with proper approximations can further accelerate the computations murai et al 1999 these methods were applied to floating structures in simple geometries recent research work was presented by otto et al 2020 on a floating mega island consisted of interconnected triangular pontoons the side length of a single module can be more than 250 m their numerical and experimental results demonstrated that the external region of the island has the worst dynamic responses it is also noted that the gap between the modules is only 7 m which is near negligible compared to the large dimension of the modules other floating multibody systems are frequently seen as floating wave energy converters wecs since wecs are characterized by specific dynamic behaviors aimed at extracting wave energy and designed to work under resonant conditions the related research is not reviewed here the literature review shows that the published research work with a focus on the hydrodynamics of floating systems with more than two bodies is few not to mention a complex floating system with 35 bodies in shallow water conditions in addition very few experimental results are available for the validation of a complex floating multi body system because of these gaps and the difficulties a decomposed strategy is adopted for hydrodynamic analysis of the fhsf which starts from an intermediate and simple subsystem see fig 3 this subsystem consists of two floating tanks and a surrounding barge frame the hydrodynamic analysis of the subsystem becomes more affordable for both experimental and numerical studies since the subsystem contains the major characteristics of the fhsf observations from this system can help to understand the hydrodynamic behaviors of the complex entire system especially the couplings among the floating modules also the subsystem can be treated as the outermost part of the fhsf the research on a modular lfs showed that the outermost modules appear to have maximum hydrodynamic responses ren et al 2019 therefore the observations from the subsystem may also qualify the conceptual design of the entire fhsf the present paper investigates the multi body hydrodynamic responses for the subsystem of fhsf with narrow gaps the main objective is to identify the hydrodynamic interactions between the floating bodies and the resonant fluid motions for the complex multi body system under various configurations which is rarely seen in the literature another objective of this paper is to verify the practical configuration of combining the floating breakwater with floating tanks extensive ocean basin experiments were conducted under various loading conditions wave headings and environmental conditions a linear potential flow theory based numerical model with a high order boundary element method hobem is established and a dipole damping lid is implemented to reduce resonant free surface elevations to a realistic level good agreement between the numerical and experimental results demonstrates that the potential flow panel method can be used to accurately predict the motion responses of the subsystem the analysis of the experimental and numerical results demonstrates the different patterns of hydrodynamic interactions in different configurations acquired knowledge may be a useful reference to the design of other coastal or even deep water floating multi body systems the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present the details of the fhsf subsystem a description of the experimental setup of the subsystem is introduced in section 3 and a numerical method based on linear potential theory is described in section 4 a description of the numerical model and validation of the dipole lid method are presented in section 5 these are followed by the comparisons between experimental and numerical results in section 6 finally the main conclusions and potential future work will be presented in section 7 2 the subsystem of the floating hydrocarbon storage facility the subsystem of the fhsf for validating study consists of a barge frame formed by four rigidly interconnected floating barges and two floating tanks with a storage capacity of 12500 m3 the enclosed barges form a frame like structure with a large moonpool it is called floating barge frame in the moonpool the two floating tanks are placed side by side with a 15 m gap the gap between the floating tanks and the barge frame is about 5 m herein we adopted froude number scaling law with a length scale factor of 1 45 and the corresponding time scale and force scale will be 1 45 and 1 45 3 respectively an articulated bridge is designed between the two floating tanks above the deck of the barge frame it has no contribution to either the structure or hydrodynamics in the present study the barge frame is moored with dolphins and moves only in heave pitch and roll with the existence of the two floating tanks the moonpool is now of irregular shape composed of various narrow gap regions as for the station keeping system the barge frame is restrained by 4 mooring dolphins at its four corners this is similar to the design in the fhsf except that 8 mooring dolphins are designed in the entire system a specially designed soft mooring system composed of 8 mooring lines is proposed to restrain the motion of floating tanks this mooring system links the floating tanks to the barge frame and works in any loading condition of the floating tanks these mooring lines are pre tensioned to prevent any of the mooring lines going slack and ensure that the floating tank and the barge frame will not collide even if one mooring line breaks the detailed layout of the mooring system can be found in the next section with a compliant design the two floating tanks can move in 6 d o f in the moonpool with the natural frequencies of motions in surge and sway outside the wave frequency range due to the complexity of the mooring system its equivalent global stiffness needs to be derived the equivalent stiffness in surge and sway is demonstrated here firstly the mooring force on the i th mooring line f m i can be expressed by the product of its stiffness k m i and its stretch as follows f m i k m i r i r i where r i is the vector pointing from the anchor point on the barge frame to the fairlead point on the floating tanks at a neutral position and r i the vector pointing from the anchor point on the barge frame to the fairlead point on the floating tanks at the new position this force may be decomposed into components in x and y direction the former is expressed as f x i f m i cos θ i f m i r i u r i u where θ i is the angle between r i and unit vector u in the x direction forces in the y direction will balance with each other due to the symmetry of the system next the equivalent global mooring stiffness k x can be determined k x i 1 8 f x i x where x is the displacement of the floating tanks in the x direction the equivalent global stiffness in sway and yaw can be derived similarly these equivalent global stiffnesses of the mooring system are plotted in fig 2 the mooring system behaves noticeably linear this is partly because of the assumption of constant stiffness of a single mooring line which is valid in this case since the floating tank can only move in a limited range where the stiffness variation of a single rope is expected to be small the main particulars of the three bodies and their inertia properties in the prototype are listed in table 1 table 2 table 3 and table 4 respectively the moments of inertia are calculated about their respective centers of gravity cog and the vertical cog is measured from the keel of the floating tank or barge frame the fhsf allows the floating tanks to store different hydrocarbon products under various loading conditions at the same time in the hydrodynamic study three loading conditions are defined based on the volume of stored hydrocarbon products in the tank 0 empty 20 partially loaded and 100 fully loaded of the design storage capacity the dynamic responses are expected to be larger in the empty condition than the other conditions as found in the previous study on a single floating tank under the design sea states wan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b therefore only the empty condition is discussed in this paper 3 experimental setup of the subsystem the experiments on the fhsf are divided into three phases focusing on a single floating tank supported by mooring fenders phase 1 the subsystem phase 2 and the entire fhsf phase 3 respectively to carry out the validation study we focus on the subsystem for more information on phase 1 and phase 3 refer to zhang et al 2019a and fonseca et al 2019 the experiments in phase 2 were undertaken in the ocean basin at sintef ocean the ocean basin has a plan area of 80 m by 60 m and its water depth was adjusted to 0 40 m to model a full scale water depth 18 m there are a double hinged wavemaker and a passive artificial beach on the opposite two ends of the basin the latter can absorb waves effectively giving a reflection of less than 10 fig 3 a and b show the detailed model test setup in the basin and a cross section view of the subsystem respectively the physical models in the basin are shown in fig 3 c the models were placed in the center of the basin 35 26 m from the wavemaker and 23 05 m away from the sidewall the dimensions and mass properties of the models are listed in table 1 to table 4 for ease of comparison to their prototype it is worth noting that the thin plates on the bottom slab see fig 3 d help reduce the motions of the floating tank as found in zhang et al 2019a b fig 3 b also shows four right handed coordinate systems defined in the model test one global coordinate system oxyz three local coordinate systems for three floating bodies the global coordinate system oxyz is fixed to the ocean basin and overlaps with the local coordinate system of the barge frame in still water the local coordinate system for the barge frame is defined at its mean position in still water and the origin is in the center of the water plane the x axes of the local and global coordinate systems are opposite to the wave propagation directions see fig 3 a and the z axes are pointing upwards from the mean free surface a similar definition is applied to the local coordinate systems for both floating tanks these coordinate systems are used in numerical models as well the station keeping system namely the soft mooring system and mooring dolphins were modeled in the test the mooring system was modeled by a group of linear springs in the tests see fig 3 c and e the stiffness of these mooring lines was scaled providing an equivalent horizontal stiffness of 1180 kn m the anchor points on the barge frame and the adjustable fairlead point on the tank wall were both 2 m above the mean water surface the detailed locations of these points were illustrated in fig 3 a the four mooring dolphins were fixed to the bottom of the basin each mooring dolphin was made of a steel tube and a red box see fig 3 a it was found that this design will introduce a stiffness of 1 0e9 kn m which is large enough to restrain the motions of the barge frame all these reported values are in full scale unless otherwise specified various key parameters were recorded through calibrated sensors the motions of the floating tanks and the barge frame were tracked by the qualisys oqus motion tracking system free surface elevations η t in the narrow gaps were measured by five resistance wave probes a single probe was made of two parallel stainless steel rods see fig 3 e these probes were mounted on the barge frame and their locations can be found in fig 3 a the recorded surface elevation was then transferred to the absolute free surface elevation referring to the global coordinate during post processing in addition two reference wave probes were set in the front and besides of the subsystem to monitor the wave fields several force transducers were used to measure forces on the mooring dolphins and tension forces on selected mooring lines see fig 3 e the accelerations of the two floating tanks were also measured to capture possible impact event the measurements from these sensors were synchronized with the incident waves with an output sampling frequency of 20 hz various combinations of loading conditions wave conditions and wave directions were explored in the model test etc the four cases selected for the analysis in this paper are listed in table 5 the different wave headings were achieved by rotating the model in the basin various wave conditions were tested however in this paper we focus on the white noise tests that provide the response amplitude operators raos of 6 d o f motions of the three bodies free surface elevations etc the significant wave height hs of the white noise is 2 m with the wave period varying from 4s to 20s 0 314 rad s to 1 57 rad s the white noise was calibrated without the presence of the subsystem the calibrated wave groups in the center of the subsystem are taken as the incident waves η in the comparison between the incident white noise spectrum and its target spectrum is shown in fig 4 which shows a very good agreement 4 numerical methodology the three dimensional linear potential flow theory is adopted in the numerical model applying potential flow panel method for wave structure interactions can be consulted in faltinsen 1993 therefore only a summary is presented here for completeness based on the inviscid irrotational and impressible assumption the velocity potential φ satisfies the governing laplace equation 2 φ 0 a complex velocity potential φ can be defined from φ re φ e i ω t where re is the real part ω is the incident wave frequency and t is time based on the linear assumption φ may be separated into radiation potentials j 1 n φ j incident wave potential φ i scattering potential φ s as expressed below φ φ i φ s j 1 n φ j where j stands for different modes of motion for an n body floating multibody system the radiation potential will include 6 n components assuming each body has 6 d o f motions it is noted that the sum of φ i and φ s is known as the diffraction potential φ d with the boundary conditions on the seabed wetted body surfaces the free surface and the radiation condition of outgoing waves in the far field a complete boundary value problem is defined the free surface boundary condition is linear to solve the problem green s theorem can be applied to derive integral equations in the boundaries for both radiation and diffraction problems respectively 2 π φ j x s b φ j ξ g n ξ d ξ s b n j g x ξ d ξ 2 π φ d x s b φ d ξ g n ξ d ξ 4 π φ i x here g ξ x is the green function in finite water depth and it is the velocity potential at

known as a high order boundary element method hobem the hobem is proven efficient and accurate lee and newman 2013 to simulate the thin plates on the bottom slab dipole elements may be introduced in the numerical model refer to lee and newman 2013 for more details in addition to introduce damping in the free surface resonant motions due to viscous effect which are neglected in potential flow a dipole plate may serve as a damping porous surface and can be placed anywhere in the fluid domain the boundary conditions over the dipole surface s d applies δ φ i ε ω φ n where ε is the damping coefficient an assumption has been undertaken that the pressure jump across the dipole surface is proportional to the normal velocity of the fluid the integral equations over the dipole damping plate are given as follows 2 π φ x s b φ g n ξ d s ξ i ω s d ε φ n ξ g n ξ d s ξ s b φ n ξ g d s ξ for field point x on sb 4 π φ n x s b φ g n ξ n x d s ξ i ω s d ε φ n ξ g n ξ n x d s ξ s b φ n ξ g n x d s

contributed from the mooring system x ω and f ω are the displacement vector and the wave excitation force and moment vector 5 numerical model the numerical model is built in wamit v7 3 in full scale using the same definition of the coordinate system as in the experiment the high order patches of the numerical models are shown in fig 5 a b respectively the thin patches in light blue on the barge frame are the dipole plates to tune the resonant fluid motions to a realistic level consistent with the experiment the width of these dipole plates is 2 m the chosen damping coefficient for dipole plates will be discussed in section 6 to clarify the light blue patches on the floating tank is to simulate the thin plates on the bottom slab in total 112 subpanels of 32 patches are used to describe a single floating tank and 144 subpanels of 36 patches are used to describe the barge frame cubic b splines are used to describe all these patches to properly model the mooring system of the floating tank the soft mooring system is introduced through a linear restoring matrix this is suitable due to the linear property of the mooring system as discussed in section 2 since the motions of the barge frame are assumed small due to its large inertia the anchor points on the barge frame may be assumed as fixed in addition the influence of the mooring system in heave for the floating tanks is small therefore the mechanical coupling is simplified to the coupling between the surge and pitch of the floating tank the coupling term in the restoring matrix can be calculated as below k 15 k 51 k x z k 14 k 41 k y z where z is the vertical distance from the fairlead point to the origin of the local coordinate of the floating tank which is 2 m k y is the equivalent mooring stiffness in y direction k 15 k 51 k 14 and k 41 are the additional elements in the restoring matrix induced by mechanical coupling generally they can be denoted as k i j where the subscript stands for the stiffness in the ith mode induced by the jth mode of motion in the numerical analysis 180 frequencies between 0 4 rad s to 1 6 rad s are covered to capture the resonant phenomenon precisely in addition to account for the viscous effect 8 3 of the critical damping is introduced in pitch and roll 7 5 of the critical damping in heave is introduced to account for the damping effect induced by the thin plates those damping factors were estimated and linearized based on decay test results following the same procedure as in zhang et al 2019a b to reduce the unrealistic potential flow free surface motions in the gaps at near resonance frequencies a linear damping coefficient is introduced in the numerical model through dipole damping lids an iteration procedure was adopted to properly determine the damping coefficient by varying it from 0 to 0 5 with an increment of 0 1 case 1 the barge frame alone under 90 deg wave heading is selected for this study fig 6 shows the experimental and numerical raos of the free surface elevation for probe w11 located at the center of the barge frame see fig 3 the incident wave direction is also shown in the figure for ease of understanding several peaks corresponding to resonant mode trapped in the moonpool of the barge frame is evident the numerical method shows good accuracy in terms of the resonant frequencies but with damping coefficient 0 0 it overestimates the peak value significantly by increasing the damping coefficient it can be found that the free surface elevation can be effectively reduced a damping coefficient 0 5 provides the most ideal results where very good agreement can be found between the numerical and experimental results at almost all the resonant modes the good agreement indicates that the viscous effect on fluid resonances may be well captured by a simple dipole lid placed at the sharp corners unless specified the damping coefficient 0 5 is used for all cases discussed in the paper below 6 results and discussion following the validated numerical results of case 1 the hydrodynamic responses and couplings between the barge frame and the fluid resonances will be demonstrated the motions of the floating tanks in case 2 4 will be presented with a focus on the hydrodynamic couplings between the motions of the floating tanks and the barge frame and the fluid resonant motions 6 1 hydrodynamic responses of the barge frame in case 1 barge frame alone the motion raos of the barge frame alone in heave and roll and 90 wave heading case 1 are plotted in fig 7 a b the wave direction is shown by a schematic drawing in fig 7 a for ease of understanding this applies to the first graph in all the figures of raos hereafter in general the motions are very mild under all the investigated wave frequencies besides there exist several canceling frequencies on the raos in both heave and roll the canceling frequency occurs mainly due to the cancellation of excitation forces moments acting on the two side barges perpendicular to the direction of incident waves to illustrate the influence of fluid resonances on the dynamic responses of the barge frame fig 7 also compares the numerical raos with different free surface damping coefficients against the experimental results for all the remaining frequencies a very good agreement can be found between experimental and numerical results irrelevant to the damping factor exaggerated peaks can be found in both heave and roll at 1 19 rad s and one additional peak in the roll rao can be found at around 1 03 rad s when no damping is introduced this implies that there is a significant coupling between the fluid resonances and the motions of the barge frame fig 8 a d show the raos of the free surface elevations for wave probes w08 w11 locations of these wave probes can be found in fig 3 a special case with a fixed barge frame is analyzed in the numerical model to help identify the couplings between the motions of the barge frame and the fluid resonant motions the results for this case are denoted as bgffix the natural frequencies of resonant modes can be identified from these figures table 6 summarizes those natural frequencies for a moving barge case 1 it can be found that all these modes are accurately predicted in the numerical model table 7 compares the natural frequencies for the fixed barge case to the analytical formula derived by molin et al 2018 for fluid resonances in a moonpool again very good agreement is found between the analytical solutions and the numerical results in general the difference is within 1 except for mode 1 and mode 2 the difference is suspected to be caused by the shallow water effect since these two frequencies are quite low no piston mode is identified for the present case by comparing the results between the moving barge and the fixed barge case two major differences can be observed firstly a shift of certain fluid resonant peaks around 0 80 rad s and 1 03 rad s can be found when the barge frame is free to move in heave and roll specifically mode 1 shifts to 0 795 rad s compared to 0 838 rad s in the fixed barge frame case see fig 6 at 0 795 rad s the heave rao also presents a peak in addition a mode at 0 997 rad s shift to 1 035 rad s the latter is associated with the peak in the roll raos of the barge frame these reveal a strong coupling between motions of the barge frame and certain sloshing modes all the remaining sloshing modes tend to be less coupled to the motion of the barge frame mainly because the motion of the barge frame is near zero at these frequencies to further illustrate the coupling effect fig 9 compares the raos of free surface elevation in the entire free surface for the fixed barge frame and the moving barge frame in these figures x and y denote the coordinate of the free surface points it can be seen that the raos of the free surface are changed due to the motions of the barge frame in general the resonant fluid motion tends to be milder when the barge frame moves a similar shift of fluid resonant frequency due to the motion of a floating body with a moonpool was reported by mciver 2005 subsequently fredriksen et al 2015 confirmed that the resonant frequency of the piston mode in a moonpool will shift to the natural frequency of the floating structure the present results confirm that the fluid resonant frequency of certain resonant sloshing modes will also shift to the peak frequencies of the motions of the floating structure two more interesting findings are observed from these results firstly one additional resonant peak can be identified at 1 190 rad s on the raos of free surface elevations when the barge frame moves in heave and roll this frequency is associated with the peaks in the raos of the barge frame s motions the exaggerated peaks in fig 7 fig 10 c and d show the raos of free surface elevations in the entire free surface in the moonpool and surrounding the barge frame under wave frequency 1 190 rad s the mode shape is difficult to identify however the mode in the interior free surface is attributed to the coupling between the motion of the barge frame secondly a peak can be found at 1 138 rad s on the raos of free surface elevations in both the fixed and moving barge frame cases the raos of free surface elevation under this frequency are plotted in fig 10 a and b a different rao pattern can be found in the moonpool the latter tends to be a combination of mode 2 in the x direction and mode 4 in the y direction this may be caused by the additional radiation waves induced by the barge frame s motions these two observations again clearly show the coupling between the motions of the barge frame and the sloshing modes in the moonpool 6 2 hydrodynamic interactions in case 2 and case 3 the side by side and tandem configuration of the subsystem the fluid resonant motions and the hydrodynamic responses of the subsystem in the side by side configuration 0 deg wave heading and the tandem configuration 90 deg wave heading are investigated fig 11 a d show the raos of the free surface elevations for wave probes w08 w11 w10 and w12 the raos of the free surface elevations for the barge frame alone are plotted for comparison green dot curve a fairly good agreement can be found between the numerical and experimental results compared to those when the barge frame is fixed a clear shift can be found in the raos of the free surface elevation for w08 and w10 in addition the magnitudes of the raos of the free surface elevations are significantly influenced by the existence of the floating tanks for example the rao is enlarged by around two times for w12 between 0 85 rad s and 1 15 rad s it also has a much broader bandwidth so we cannot identify any modes in this range in contrast the rao for w10 is much smaller than that of w12 with a two times reduction between 0 6 rad s and 1 0 rad s the differences can be explained by the shielding effect induced by the floating tanks when the two floating tanks are placed in tandem 90 wave heading the raos of the free surface elevation for probe w08 and w12 are illustrated in fig 12 the raos at the other locations are much smaller than those in the side by side configuration because of the shielding effect thus they are not plotted good agreement is again found between the numerical and experimental results for the tandem configuration it seems the resonances are more severe under a wave frequency around 1 02 rad s where the maximum raos peak can be larger than 3 5 fig 13 shows the raos of the barge frame in heave and pitch and the raos of the barge frame alone are plotted for comparison in case 2 near canceling points can also be found in both heave and pitch comparable to that in the case of the barge frame alone the influence of hydrodynamic interactions on the raos of the barge frame tends to be marginal outside the range between 0 75 rad s and 1 20 rad s this may be because the long waves can easily transmit both the barge frame and the floating tanks in a shallow draft while the shorter waves are reflected by the barge frame this can also be supported by the fact that there is no obvious resonant peak in the raos of the free surface elevations see fig 11 on the contrary a noticeable fluctuation in the motion raos of the barge frame can be found between 0 75 and 1 2 rad s where both heave and pitch of the barge frame are reduced significantly because there is no obvious motion of the floating tanks see fig 13 the reduction is suspected to be at least partly caused by fluid resonances which are exaggerated in this range in general the raos of the barge frame signals the effect of strong hydrodynamic couplings in the present system in fig 14 the raos in 6 d o f of the two floating tanks in side by side configuration are illustrated where the floating tank 1 is denoted as tnk1 and floating tank 2 is denoted as tnk2 respectively see fig 3 the agreement between the numerical and experimental results is quite good in all the 6 d o f motions due to the symmetry of the subsystem the motions of the two floating tanks are identical in general all these raos reduce to a negligible level when the wave frequency is higher than 1 20 rad s furthermore the natural period in surge is larger than 16s and the natural period in pitch is about 10 2s both are far away from the operational hs 1 m tp 5 0 s and extreme hs 1 8 m tp 7 0 s sea states these imply that the wave frequency responses of the floating tanks should be mild it supports that the present compliant design works efficiently on reducing the wave frequency hydrodynamic responses of the subsystem in addition noticeable motions in sway and roll can be identified even in head sea conditions due to the hydrodynamic interactions for example in roll raos a peak exists at around 0 85 rad s which is related to the same peak on the free surface elevations for w11 see fig 11 c they can be of the same magnitude as the motions in surge and pitch and they are strongly coupled with the fluid resonant motions this type of hydrodynamic responses should be carefully considered in the design of a floating multibody system the raos of barge frame s motions in heave and roll and the raos of 6 d o f motions of the floating tanks in the tandem configuration case 3 are plotted in fig 15 and fig 16 respectively if we compare the raos in heave to those in the side by side configuration see fig 14 it can be found the heaving amplitude of the upstream floating tank increases to around 1 5 times that of the downstream floating tank at 0 65 rad s there is no significant fluid resonance in this range so this reduction can be explained by the shielding effect however there appears a different trend in the motions of floating tanks in sway and roll when the wave frequency is lower than 0 67 rad s for example at 0 63 rad s the experimental raos in the roll of the downstream floating tank is about 1 6 times larger than that of the upstream floating tank the numerical results show an over prediction of the raos in roll of the downstream floating tank at around 0 63 rad s natural period in roll the overprediction in the numerical model is suspected to be caused by the different viscous damping effects if we compare the raos in roll to those in pitch in case 2 see fig 14 c it can be found that the upstream floating tank has a much smaller rao at wave frequency around 0 63 rad s while the downstream floating tank has a comparable raos since 0 63 rad s is the natural frequency of roll and pitch motion it suggests that the upstream floating tank experiences larger damping forces in the tandem configuration the larger damping force may be induced by the large fluid resonance in the gap in the numerical model we apply the same damping factor to both floating tanks and this causes the discrepancies the underprediction of the raos in roll when ω 0 55 rad s tends to be similar to those found in zhang et al 2019a b and may be due to the nonlinearities in the experiment further study is needed in the future to further understand the fluid resonant motions and its coupling with the motion of the floating bodies the free surface elevations in the gaps and surrounding the barge frame are calculated based on the validated numerical models the results for the side by side configuration and the tandem configuration are plotted in fig 17 and fig 18 respectively in fig 17 a no resonance can be found in the fluid field when the wave frequency is around 0 616 rad s although the raos of floating tanks motions in both pitch and roll fig 14 d e show a peak this suggests that the resonant motions of the floating tank have a marginal influence on the fluid resonant motions fig 17 b is the raos at the frequency of 0 873 rad s there exists a resonant peak between the two floating tanks and a smaller resonant peak near the front corner of the barge frame while the raos are near zero between the floating tank and the side barge this can cause pressure difference which can induce transverse motions sway and roll of the floating tanks in fig 17 c we can also observe a large peak near the front inner corners of the barge frame with an rao larger than 3 0 and a second peak near the back inner corner of the barge frame this explains the peak in surge raos at around 1 050 rad s these results demonstrate the strong coupling between the fluid resonant motions and the motions of the floating tanks fig 17 d shows the magnitude of raos of free surface elevations at wave frequency 1 257 rad s where no resonant motion can be found it indicates that the present design may not experience serious resonant fluid motions in the operational sea state in the tandem configuration no significant resonant peak can be identified in long waves as in the side by side configuration for example in waves with frequency 0 616 rad s see fig 18 a however significantly different patterns of free surface motion can be found in fig 18 c when there exist strong fluid resonances at wave frequency 1 013 rad s three resonant peaks can be found in the front gap and two side gaps between the upstream floating tank and the barge frame however the raos of the free surface elevations around the downstream floating tank is near zero these findings on the one hand alert that the fluid resonant motions should be carefully considered when designing a similar floating system on the other hand they suggest that the influence of fluid resonant motions around the downstream floating bodies may not be significant at certain frequencies furthermore it is also identified that the diffracted wave may cause a large runup along the front side of the barge for both side by side and tandem configurations the barge needs to be designed with a sufficient freeboard to avoid overtopping water including nonlinear effects 6 3 hydrodynamic interactions in case 4 the subsystem in oblique seas it is also interesting to find out if the strong hydrodynamic interactions and free surface resonance identified for the other two wave headings could be different in oblique seas 45 deg wave heading fig 19 shows the experimental and numerical raos of the free surface elevation for different wave probes the frequencies of resonant modes are consistent with those in figs 8 and 11 this suggests that the natural frequencies of the resonant modes are not sensitive to wave headings however a significant reduction appears in the amplitude of the raos from over 3 5 to less than 2 0 compared to those in case 2 and case 3 the raos of the motions of the barge frame and the two floating tanks also show a significant reduction in the oblique seas which are illustrated in fig 20 and fig 21 respectively a surprising finding is that the rao of the barge frame s motion in heave is near zero for the wave frequencies larger than 1 0 rad s and it is only about half of those in the side by side and tandem configuration for the remaining frequencies see figs 12 and 17 a similar reduction can be found in its roll motion although the heave rao of the tank 1 increases compared to the side by side configuration it is still smaller than that in the tandem configuration the hydrodynamic couplings still exist in the subsystem but tend to be less significant for example the coupling between fluid resonant motion and sway is similar to that in the tandem configuration as shown in fig 21 b in general the hydrodynamic responses of the barge frame and the floating tanks and the fluid resonances tend to be much more moderate even in long waves under this wave heading therefore small wave frequency responses of the subsystem are expected in the realistic sea states these results also suggest that it may be possible to avoid large fluid resonant motions and responses of the floating bodies by proper orientation of a floating system to principle wave directions 7 conclusions hydrodynamic interactions for a subsystem of a novel fhsf are investigated through experimental and numerical analysis the subsystem consists of two floating hydrocarbon storage tanks and a barge frame and it models some of the major characteristics of the entire fhsf comparisons between numerical and experimental results are performed for 4 representative cases barge frame alone in 90 deg barge together with the two tanks in side by side 0 deg and tandem 90 deg configurations and an oblique sea condition 45 deg the investigation focuses on the fluid resonances in the narrow gaps and the hydrodynamic interactions in the subsystem the major findings are summarized as follows from the study of the side by side configuration 0 deg complex hydrodynamic interactions are observed between the resonant free surface motions the motions of the floating tanks and the motions of the barge frame the resonant free surface motions are found to be coupled to the sway and roll motion of the two floating tanks the magnitude of the motions in sway and roll can reach the same level as in surge and pitch even in 0 waves therefore it is concluded that hydrodynamic couplings should be carefully considered the conclusion is useful when designing a similar multibody floating system for example a multimodule lfs with relatively large gaps in the tandem configuration 90 deg a different resonant free surface behavior was observed which only occurs at the region close to the upstream floating tank shielding effects were found by the fact that the heaving motion of the upstream floating tank can be 1 5 times that of the downstream tank a contrary trend is found in roll and sway where the downstream floating tank shows larger motion at its resonant frequency the numerical results show a discrepancy with the experimental results especially in roll which suggests that the applied damping coefficient in roll should be larger for the upstream tank than for the downstream tank these findings suggest that for a tandem floating system the upstream body may not always show larger motion one last configuration when the subsystem is under 45 deg wave excitations the hydrodynamic responses of the barge frame and the floating tanks are found moderate even in long waves it may be associated with the effectiveness of the barge frame on reflecting the incident waves that can cause resonance therefore adjusting the direction of the floating system may be a potential solution to reduce both the resonant free surface motion and motions of the floating system in shallow water coastal areas finally it is noted that the raos of the floating bodies motion are all mild in the frequency range of the design sea states however the realistic hydrodynamic performance of the floating system needs to be carefully checked especially when there exist second order excitations therefore planned future work consists of conducting an extended hydrodynamic analysis on the performance of the subsystem and the entire system in the operational and extreme sea conditions credit authorship contribution statement chi zhang

21531,accidental leakages in underwater natural gas pipelines pose significant risks for the environment therefore it is essential to estimate the leakage rate and monitor the methane diffusion range outside the pipeline which is challengeable due to the presence of water the main contribution of this work is to establish the leakage rate calculation and gas dispersion models using the experimental and numerical methods firstly the influences of the pressure leakage orifice diameter and water depth on the leakage rate and gas dispersion process were revealed through experiments further according to the established experimental facilities the numerical models including the integral mathematical model and computational fluid dynamic model were established according to the axial velocity radius and spring height the two model were compared and validated in addition a field simulation using computational fluid dynamic model was conducted to quantify the gas leakage rate and dispersion prediction predicting the rising time and diffusion range the results indicate that the quantifying estimation correlation can predict the leakage rate in the sea with errors less than 16 47 and the computational fluid dynamic model could predict the dispersion process more accurately while the integral mathematical model could predict the dispersion process more quickly keywords natural gas pipelines underwater quantifying estimation leakage rate diffusion range 1 introduction pipeline distribution systems have been established to transport natural gas ng and hydrogen from fields to consumers with the aging of the pipeline systems and external loads such as corrosions and third party damages ng leakages from pipelines occur frequently posing hazards and risks to the environment and people robert et al 2014 compared with onshore pipelines the water environment of the sub sea gas pipeline is more complicated which leads to the pipeline failure more frequently once leakage occurs bubble plumes being formed hissong et al 2014 any leakage from an ng pipeline may lead to serious environmental and public safety impacts jiang et al 2020 van wijk et al 2014 such as fires explosions and water pollution especially when it comes to background leakages haghighi et al 2012 a background leakage is regarded as occurring when the ratio of the leakage orifice diameter to the pipe diameter is small or the working pressure is low to prevent the ocean from damage in addition to assessment of the long term reliability of pipeline materials it is extremely important to understand that the ng leakage rate and diffusion range of sub sea pipelines is a fundamental factor to be considered in the design and maintenance of safe pipelines and for emergency response nowadays leakage and dispersion estimation for ng pipelines has been attracting significant interests mainly in relation to the physical process by which the leaked gas diffuses in the soil or air many experimental and numerical studies have been conducted focusing on this topic with theoretical and empirical equations being determined however researches on the leakage and diffusion of gas in water required further study in 1998 montiel montiel et al 1998 established a mathematical model of accidental gas release from pipelines as a combination of the classical hole and pipe models for the calculation of gas releases without taking surrounding water into consideration when small leakage occurs the valves located at both ends of the pipeline remain open the leakage flow will reach a steady state when the gas releases to the air lu lu et al 2014 derived a mathematical model to calculate the leakage rate to take the water into consideration a series of experiments were performed to establish the empirical model of which some were conducted in laboratory with the water depth less than 2 m while some were conducted with the water depth below 50 m milgram 1983 engebretsen et al 1997 when the gas releases to the water dou 2015 modified lu s equation using the static pressure in water to replace the atmosphere pressure however as the gas releases to the water there will be a pressure gradient outside instead of being constant which will lead to great errors this fact also exists when the gas releases to the soil taking the soil into consideration ebrahimi moghadam ebrahimi moghadam et al 2016 ebrahimi moghadam et al 2018 derived an equation by fitting the simulation results besides a field experiment was performed in the norwegian sea with water depth of 844 m johansenet al 2001 although the experiments could provide the actual leakage information they cost money with limited experimental conditions cloete et al 2009 the numerical simulation cloete et al 2009 is proposed as an alternative approach that can solve the problems in the experiments the available numerical models include integral model and computational fluid dynamic cfd model several integral models are reported in the literature e g wimalaratne et al 2015 premathilake et al 2016 which were tested by the laboratory and field experiments these models are used to simulate and analyze numerous oil and gas release scenarios in which the subsurface oil or gas release and dispersion have been studied over the years some models are based on the multiphase cfd method a two phase eulerian eulerian cfd model was proposed by buscaglia buscaglia et al 2002 however the pure eulerian eulerian approach was computationally expensive and failed to capture the jet transition in modelling subsea gas release olsen and skjetne 2016a olsen and skjetne 2016b cloete et al 2009 developed a method coupled volume of fluid vof and discrete phase model dpm to simulate the plume and free surface behavior resulting from a sub sea gas pipe rupture olsen and skjetne 2016a olsen and skjetne 2016b simulated the underwater gas plume and free surface behavior which were demonstrated by accurately reproducing a small scale experiment the comparison between previous studies and current study is shown in table 1 the main contribution of this work is to establish the leakage rate calculation and gas dispersion models using the experimental and numerical methods firstly the influences of the pressure leakage orifice diameter and water depth on the leakage rate and gas dispersion process were revealed through experiments further according to the established experimental facilities the numerical models including the integral mathematical model and cfd model were established according to the axial velocity radius and spring height the two model were compared and validated in addition a field simulation using cfd model was conducted to quantify the gas leakage rate and dispersion prediction predicting the rising time and diffusion range the results indicate that the quantifying estimation correlation can predict the leakage rate in the sea 2 methodology 2 1 stress analysis of gas bubbles in water after the gas leaks to the water a gas bubble will be generated firstly which is affected by multiple forces during its growth neglecting the forces in the horizon direction the forces in the vertical direction are cared about including buoyancy f f the difference between buoyancy and gravity momentum force f m flow resistance force f d and surface tension force f σ as shown in fig 1 according to newton s second law ditmars and cederwall 1977 the forces follow 1 f f f m f d f σ m a p where m is the mass of the bubble kg a p is the acceleration m s2 eq 1 is derived based on the fact that in the inertial system the bubble is in a non equilibrium state with a certain acceleration to solve eq 1 the inertial force is introduced and eq 2 is then expressed as 2 f f f m f d f σ f i 0 the buoyancy force ditmars and cederwall 1977 can be expressed as 3 f f π d b 3 6 g ρ w ρ b where d b is the bubble diameter m g is the gravity acceleration m s2 ρ

the rising speed of the bubble m s c d is the resistance coefficient of the bubble movement which is related to the reynolds number r e ρ w u d d p μ w μ w is the dynamic viscosity of water pa s since thein previous investigations many experimental and numerical studies have been conducted with both theoretical and empirical equations being proposed however most present studies focus on gas diffusion in the water neglecting the leakage rate calculation which is very important for calculating the axial velocity plume radius spring height and rising time and surface diffusion area the characteristics as well as the location and size of gas plume underwater were not presented in detail moreover the models currently available for performing leakage dispersion range prediction show a major gap in the range of conditions over which they can be applied with a reasonable degree of accuracy some models were based on the integral model with large errors some models were based on the cfd model with the help of fluent software although both can be applied to portray the diffusion process the advantages and disadvantages between the two methods were not clarified hence calculation of the gas leakage rate from a sub sea pipeline based on experiments and simulations which determines the gas dispersion in the water may be a remarkable contribution to the state of the art moreover comparison between the integral model and cfd model can help us to decide which method should be chosen according to the actual situation when the bubble rises is relatively small the bubble can be regarded as a rigid body regardless of the bubble viscosity c d can be calculated as follows liao et al 2010 6 c d 24 r e 10 4 re 0 4 c d 18 5 r e 0 6 2 re 500 c d 0 44 500 re 2 10 5 the surface tension resistance wang 2006 can be calculated as 7 f σ π d k σ where σ is the interfacial tension coefficient n m when the gas flows into the water through the leakage the acceleration of the bubble will also accelerate the surrounding water which can be regarded as the virtual mass force ditmars and cederwall 1977 8 f i d d t ρ l α ρ w v d u d where v d π d p 3 6 is the bubble volume m3 α is the virtual mass force coefficient during the bubble formation process the bottom of the bubble adheres to the orifice the bubble volume gradually expands as the gas continues to leak into the bubble and the bubble center rises gradually the process is shown in fig 2 a c the expansion rate of bubble radius can be regarded as the rising speed of bubble center then the bubble rising speed can be expressed as ditmars and cederwall 1977 9 u d u 1 d r 1 d t d 3 v 1 4 π 1 3 d t 1 3 3 4 π 1 3 v 1 2 3 d v 1 d t where u 1 is the bubble expansion speed m s r 1 and d 1 are the bubble radius and diameter m v 1 is the bubble volume ditmars and cederwall 1977 which follows eq 10 m3 10 d v 1 d t q v the rising acceleration of the bubble is then expressed as ditmars and cederwall 1977 11 d u d d t 2 q v 2 9 3 4 π 1 3 v 1 5 3 therefore eq 8 can be rewritten as 12 f i ρ b α ρ w v 1 d u 1 d t u d d v 1 d t substituting eq s 9 10 and 11 into 12 yields 13 f i q v 2 3 π d 1 2 ρ b α ρ w eq 2 is

orifice as the gas continues to leak into the bubble the bottom of the bubble begins to depart from the leakage orifice through a narrow neck the bubble is connected to the leakage orifice until the neck breaks away this stage could be seen in fig 2 d during the departure process u 2 represents the departure speed of the bubble from the neck m s d 2 is the bubble diameter m v 2 is the bubble

formed under the momentum jet which can be called as the flow formation zone the initial bubble generates expands departs and rises during which the necking and bulging of the bubble plume can also be observed showing that the bubble has a process of shrinking inward and expanding outward further full development of the plume develops for the second stage which can be called as the shaped flow zone as shown in fig 3 in this stage the self buoyancy of the gas will replace the initial momentum as the dominated force and the impact of the initial momentum on the plume becomes negligible gas rising will cause turbulence which will entrap the surrounding water into the moving plume called the entrainment phenomenon the tip of the plume splits from the middle due to the shearing effect of the water on the plume the entire process is similar to the flower blooming the cut gas will return to the plume body again with the entrainment effect and continues to rise with the plume the fully developed ascending plume will form an inverted cone zone finally there is the surface flow stage when the gas reaches to the surface the entrained water will not flow into the atmosphere with the gas but flows radially outward on the horizontal surface driving the bubbles away from the plume axis this process will cause the water surface to rise forming a spring most gases will continue to flow into the atmosphere forming surface turbulence or boiling called the surface flow zone during the three stages the forces suffered by the plume are related to the leakage flow rate pressure orifice diameter water density and gravity acceleration the forces are also influenced by the frequency of the plume bulging the dimensional analysis method is used to analyze the forces during the plume rising process as shown in the following equation 20 f m d ρ g d p f 0 take the gas momentum flux m d water density ρ and leakage orifice diameter d as the basic dimensions three terms are derived

empirical coefficients milgram and burgess 1984 spalding 1963 woodward and mudan 1991 in the above equations in the integral model could be set as shown in table 2 in the above section the integral model is established of which the empirical coefficients are given the numerical solution steps of the integral model can be seen in fig 5 2 2 2 theoretical basis of cfd model for underwater gas dispersion 1 a coupled dpm vof model the euler lagrangian model regards the leaked gas as the lagrangian discrete phase and the surrounding water as the continuous euler phase these discrete phase particles flow in the continuous phase and interact with each other by exchanging mass momentum and energy which is also called as the coupled dpm vof model to capture the leaked gas in the water the two phase free surfaces can be tracked by the vof model solving the continuity equation momentum equation and energy equation as seen in the literatures li and chen 2018 li and chen 2016 for the dpm model the leaked gas is regarded as a discrete phase which is tracked by a balancing force applied to the discrete phase particles 2 bubble density and size models as the bubble rises in the water the depth where the bubble is located becomes smaller resulting in that the surrounding pressure changes significantly which leads to the bubble density decrease the density of underwater gas bubble can be expressed as li and chen 2018 li and chen 2016 40 ρ b m b p r t 41 p p 0 ρ l g h p where m b is the relative molecular mass of the leaked gas r is the general gas constant j kmol k p is the hydrostatic pressure suffered by the bubble pa p 0 is the atmospheric pressure pa h p is the water depth where the bubble is located m the bubble size is always regarded as constant in present models to simplify the calculation process however the bubble size varies from moment to moment due to bursting and merging when the bubble rises which leads to the existing model fails to accurately predict the diffusion of the bubble plume characteristics laux laux and johansen 1999 established a bubble size model under the euler frame by solving the transport equation which can predict the diffusion process accurately 3 experimental and simulation 3 1 experimental 3 1 1 experimental setup the experimental system consists of three parts pipeline data collection and underwater leakage parts the flow chart can be seen in fig 6 the total length of the pipeline loop is 251 5 m with the inner diameter of 42 mm the leakage system is mainly composed of a transparent water tank and a leakage section as shown in fig 7 the size of the water tank is 1 1 1 5 m a leakage is simulated by controlling a pneumatic valve on a branch pipe extending from the gas pipeline at the back of the control valve a leakage orifice is installed which controls the leakage flowrates by changing the diameter pressure transducers and mass flow meters are installed at the front and back of the leakage hole a high speed camera is arranged to observe the leakage diffusion process in real time the measuring range of the flowmeter is 0 01 1 nm3 h and the accuracy is 0 2 the measuring range of the pressure transmitter is 0 0 6 mpa and the accuracy is 0 5 fs the fastcam sa x2 high speed camera is chosen equipped with c mos image sensor which can take photos with 1024 1024 pixels at 13 500 frames per second in this study the shooting time is set as 5 s at a speed of 5000 frames per second 3 1 2 experimental scenarios the experiments were carried out under the following conditions the leakage orifice diameter of 1 2 and 3 mm the working pressure of 100 200 and 300 kpa the water depth of 30 60 and 90 cm the direct measured parameters were the leakage orifice size pressure and water depth the uncertainty was given by instrument error the uncertainty of the methane flow rate axial velocity plume radius and spring height should be calculated by the following formula moffat 1988 42 δ y i 1 n f x i δ x i 2 where fig 18 is the uncertainty of the directly measured variable fig 19 is the serial number of each variable to ensure the repeatability and reproducibility of experimental results each experiment was repeated three times of which the average value was calculated and analyzed and the uncertainty of each variable can also be calculated all of which were smaller than 2 5 validating that the experimental setup had acceptable accuracy 3 2 simulation when the water depth was 0 9 m and leakage hole size was 3 mm a three dimensional underwater diffusion model was established with the help of fluent software of which the size was 1 1 1 5 m the leakage orifice was located at the center of the bottom and the grid near the leakage point was refined as shown in fig 8 the calculation area was divided into water and air sections through the patch option the upper boundary of the air was set as the pressure outlet boundary the sides and bottom of the model were set as the non slip solid wall and the leakage hole with a radius of 1 5 mm at the bottom was set as the air mass flow inlet boundary condition in the dpm model corresponding to the leakage flowrate in the experiments the piso algorithm and k ε turbulence model were used it should be noted that bubble density and size for the model was imported by the udf functions to consider the bursting and merging process during gas rising the independence of different mesh grids of 67800 376000 1029000 should be conducted before the simulation when the water depth was 0 9 m and the leakage orifice diameter was 3 mm the results of the plume rising time obtained by different grid numbers and experiment could be seen in fig 9 considering the calculation accuracy and time the model with the grid number of 376 000 was selected for further simulations 4 results and discussion 4 1 experimental results and discussion 4 1 1 leakage rate when the pressure was 100 kpa with the leakage orifice diameter of 2 mm and the water depth of 90 cm the flow fluctuations were measured by flowmeter 1 and 2 as shown in fig 10 when there was no leakage the flow rates of the two flowmeters remained basically consistent at 16 59 nm3 h at about 20 s as the leakage valve opened instantly the flow rate of flowmeter 1 started to rise while that of flowmeter 2 started to decrease sharply after the leakage was stable for about 60 s as the leakage valve was closed the flow rates in the pipeline returned to the original value again the leakage flow could be calculated by the differences between the two measured flows during stable state pressure changes were recorded by transmitter 1 and 2 as shown in fig 11 when there was no leakage the pressure of transmitter 1 stabilized at 100 kpa and that of transmitter 2 stabilized at 99 17 kpa after the leakage valve opened instantly at about 20 s both dropped sharply and stabilized at about 40 s after being stable for 60 s as the leakage valve was closed the pressures returned to the original value again both the flow variation trend and the pressure change trend coincide with those of the pipeline with leakage into the air at 100 kpa the relationship between the leakage rate and the leakage hole diameter is seen in fig 12 when the water depth is 90 cm the relationship between the leakage rate and the pressure level is shown in fig 13 for a leakage hole diameter of 3 mm the relationship between the leakage rate and the water depth is shown in fig 14 in fig 12 the leakage rate increases with the increase of leakage hole size which approximately follows a kind of power function relationship moreover as the water depth increases the influence of the leakage hole on the leakage rate will be weakened in fig 13 the leakage rate increases with the increase of pressure which approximately follows a linear relationship and as the leakage hole size increases the slope gets larger in fig 14 the leakage rate decreases with the increase of water depth without an obvious function relationship comparing these three figures the change of the hole diameter has the greatest influence on the leakage rate followed by the pressure and the influence of the water depth is the smallest which were validated by the results shown in li s research li et al 2019 li and han 2020 4 1 2 underwater gas diffusion process at 100 kpa with the leakage orifice diameter of 1 mm and water depth of 90 cm the plume in the water could be seen in fig 15 in fig 15 the plumes successively went through the process of bubble generation expansion rupture and rising cycle which could also be seen in fig 16 when the pressure was 300 kpa with the leakage orifice diameter of 3 mm and water depth of 60 cm comparing these two conditions as the pressure and leakage hole diameter get larger and the water depth becomes smaller the initial momentum of the bubble plume will become larger and the diffusion of the bubble plume in the water will change from the bubble form to the small air mass moreover the effect of the shearing resistance of the water during the ascent is also reduced so that the axial ascending velocity of the plume becomes larger resulting in a decrease in the rise time and an increase in the fountain height on the water surface at the same time the radial diffusion velocity increases which makes the diffusion angle of the bubble plume increase and leads to the corresponding increase of the plume diameter the detailed influences on the gas diffusion process could be seen as follows 4 1 3 influencing factors on underwater gas diffusion 1 influence on axial velocity when the leakage hole diameter was 3 mm with the water depth of 90 cm the plumes at 100 200 and 300 kpa could be recorded as shown in fig 17 in fig 17 a at 100 kpa when the gas leakage rate was small the bubble plume was relatively sparse the diffusion radius and the spring height were also small and the time required by the plume to rise to the water surface was 1 46 s as the pressure increased the consumed time decreased while the other parameters increased which was validated by the results shown in li s research li et al 2019 li and han 2020 to describe the influences more clearly the axial velocity dispersion radius and spring height of the bubble plume were chosen to be calculated imagej image software was used to draw the pictures of consecutive frames from the saved plume videos the plume height difference of two consecutive picture was divided by the interval time calculating the axial velocity the depth of 9 monitoring points was 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 and 90 cm the axial velocity distribution of bubble plume could be obtained in table 3 and fig 18 the axial velocity increased with the increase of pressure and leakage orifice diameter while decreased with the increase of water depth the reason for this trend mainly results from the fact that as the pressure and leakage hole diameter get larger and the water depth becomes smaller the initial momentum of the bubble plume will become larger and the resistance of the water will become weak 2 influence on radius the radius of bubble plume could be obtained in table 4 and fig 19 the plume radius increased with the increase of pressure water depth and leakage orifice diameter the relation between the radius and the depth follows the linear function as the pressure and leakage hole diameter get larger the initial momentum of the bubble plume will become larger and as the water depth increases the resistance of the water will become stronger both contribute to the increase of the plume radius 3 influence on spring height when the water depth was 90 cm with the leakage orifice diameter of 3 mm the spring heights under different pressures could be obtained in fig 20 when the pressure was 100 200 and 300 kpa respectively the spring height reached the maximum value of 11 9 14 5 and 16 9 cm at 1 9 s 1 4 s and 1 2 s respectively the maximum spring heights under different conditions could be obtained as shown in fig 21 the spring height increased with the increase of pressure and leakage orifice diameter the relation between the spring height and the pressure follows the linear function 4 2 numerical results and discussion of integral model and cfd model when the leakage flowrate was 0 75 m3 h the cfd simulation results could be seen in fig 22 compared to the experimental results in fig 22 the plumes successively went through the process of bubble generation expansion rupture and rising cycle the plume obtained by cfd simulation agrees well with the experimental one in three diffusion stages as the leakage rate decreased the initial momentum of the bubble plume decreased leading to the decrease of the axial velocity the axial velocity with leakage rate of 0 21 and 0 37 m3 h obtained by cfd model integral model and experiments could be seen in fig 23 in fig 23 as the water depth increased the axial velocity decreased when the depth was constant as the leakage flow rate increased from 0 21 to 0 37 m3 h the axial velocity increased the axial velocity of the integral model was basically the same as the experimental one the result of cfd simulation was larger than the experimental one and as the water depth increased they got closer this resulted from the fact that the cfd model based on the reynolds time averaged turbulence method ignored the dissolution of gas in water and viscous forces between the bubbles and water the numerical results could be validated by the experimental results which indicated that both of the integral model and cfd model could be applied to calculate the axial velocity distribution in addition the radius could be obtained by the numerical models as shown in fig 24 in fig 24 as the water depth increased the radius increased when the depth was constant as the leakage flow rate increased from 0 21 to 0 37 m3 h the radius varied little the radius predicted by the integral model was basically the same as the experimental one while that of cfd simulation was slightly larger which indicated that both of the integral model and cfd model could be applied to calculate the plume radius besides the axial velocity and the radius the spring was also obtained as shown in fig 25 in fig 25 the spring could be depicted by the cfd model and experiments through high speed camera moreover the spring heights could be calculated by processing the figures for the integral model although the figure couldn t be drawn the spring height distribution in the radial direction on the water surface could be calculated directly of which the results could be seen in fig 26 when the water depth was 1 1 m in fig 26 the spring heights in the center line were obtained by the integral model which were 0 0508 0 0748 and 0 1305 m for the leakage rates of 0 21 0 37 and 0 84 m3 h respectively friedl friedl and fannelop 2000 established a relationship between the maximum spring height the average initial one and the center one calculated by the integral model as shown in eqs 43 and 44 43 h p 2 h f 44 h p max 3 1 h f thereafter the maximum and initial spring heights could be calculated likewise the initial spring height and maximum spring height of the cfd model and experiments can be obtained as shown in fig 27 in fig 27 as the leakage rate increased both of the initial and maximum spring heights increased moreover the errors between the numerical models and experiments could be calculated the average relative error of cfd model was 8 9 while that of the integral model was 17 2 which indicated that the cfd model had advantage over the integral model in calculating the spring heights from the results of axial velocity radius spring height the cfd model and the integral model are both effective to obtain the underwater gas diffusion process which were validated by the experimental results the cfd model could draw the visible diffusion figures and is affected little by its parameters although there are some assumptions and the results of the cfd model are more accurate than those of the integral model in the calculations of spring height however it wastes time the integral model saves time without drawing diffusion figures which is also influenced by the empirical parameters and when calculating the axial velocity and plume radius the errors of both of the cfd model and integral model are small therefore to obtain the detailed information and draw the leakage and diffusion process during researches the cfd model is the option however when we have to calculate the dispersion process as soon as possible to provide timely response strategy for the accidents the integral model can be applied 4 3 case study 4 3 1 leak rate prediction from the experimental study on the leakage rate the influencing factors on the leakage rate were revealed through the numerical study on the diffusion process the integral model and cfd model were validated in this section a large scale field pipeline was chosen for which the cfd simulation was conducted to establish the leakage rate and diffusion models the leakage hole diameters in the simulation were set as 5 10 15 and 20 mm the water depth was 5 10 15 and 20 m and the pressures were 3000 5000 7000 and 9000 kpa the relations between the leakage rate and the pressure orifice diameter water depth could be obtained respectively the correlations between the leakage rates and the three influencing factors were the same as those obtained in the laboratory experiments the leakage rate increased exponentially with the leakage orifice diameter linearly with the pressure and decreases with the increase of water depth for background leakages lu et al 2014 xie et al 2015 according to the fitted empirical equation for the buried gas pipelines ebrahimi moghadam et al 2016 the leakage rate of underwater gas pipelines could be calculated as 45 q 0 0591 h 750 9 0 951 0 167 d 1 8 p 0 95 where q is the leakage rate m3 h h is the water depth m d is the leakage orifice diameter mm p is the pressure kpa to verify the accuracy of eq 45 when the soil depth for the equation in literature ebrahimi moghadam et al 2016 and the water depth for eq 45 were both 0 the calculated leakage rates could be seen in fig 28 the errors of the established empirical leakage rate model in this study were less than 18 63 4 3 2 leakage diffusion process firstly the bubble plume velocity distribution in radial and axial directions was analyzed when the water depth was 15 m as shown in figs 29 and 30 respectively in fig 29 the radial velocity of the plume followed approximately gaussian function which validated the assumptions in the integral model in fig 30 the relationship between the axial velocity and water depth was the same as that obtained in experiments likewise the relation between the radius and the water depth was the same when the full scale water depth was considered the time consumed by the gas bubble reached to the water surface and the diffusion range on the surface were both of great significance to predict the leakage consequences which could provide solutions for the response strategy when the water depth was 15 m the time and the diffusion radius could be presented as 14 1 s and 3 9 m for 352 m3 h 10 6 s and 4 4 m for 735 m3 h 7 0 s and 5 4 m for 1116 m3 h 5 9 s and 6 5 m for 1469 m3 h 3 8 s and 8 1 m for 1852 m3 h as the leakage rate increased the time consumed got shorter while the diffusion radius increased 5 conclusions in this study a leakage rate estimation model and a dispersion prediction model were developed for sub sea gas pipelines using experimental and numerical simulation methods the following conclusions were drawn 1 the influences of the pressure leakage orifice diameter and water depth on the leakage rate and gas dispersion process were revealed through experiments the quantifying estimation correlation which can predict the leakage rate in the sea was established through the numerical models the errors were less than 16 47 2 the numerical models including the integral mathematical model and computational fluid dynamic model were established which were validated by the axial velocity radius and spring height the relative error for the spring height calculations of cfd model was 8 9 while that of the integral model was 17 2 3 the rising time and diffusion range of the leaked gas could be predicted by the established numerical models the results indicate that the computational fluid dynamic model could predict the dispersion process more accurately with more detailed information while the integral mathematical model could predict the dispersion process more quickly and directly 4 in the future the rising time and dispersion range could be calculated considering the ocean current moreover if the leaked gas above the water is ignited the consequences should be predicted to broadcast a warning

21531,accidental leakages in underwater natural gas pipelines pose significant risks for the environment therefore it is essential to estimate the leakage rate and monitor the methane diffusion range outside the pipeline which is challengeable due to the presence of water the main contribution of this work is to establish the leakage rate calculation and gas dispersion models using the experimental and numerical methods firstly the influences of the pressure leakage orifice diameter and water depth on the leakage rate and gas dispersion process were revealed through experiments further according to the established experimental facilities the numerical models including the integral mathematical model and computational fluid dynamic model were established according to the axial velocity radius and spring height the two model were compared and validated in addition a field simulation using computational fluid dynamic model was conducted to quantify the gas leakage rate

natural gas pipelines underwater quantifying estimation leakage rate diffusion range 1 introduction pipeline distribution systems have been established to transport natural gas ng and hydrogen from fields to consumers with the aging of the pipeline systems and external loads such as corrosions and third party damages ng leakages from pipelines occur frequently posing hazards and risks to the environment and people robert et al 2014 compared with onshore pipelines the water environment of the sub sea gas pipeline is more complicated which leads to the pipeline failure more frequently once leakage occurs bubble plumes being formed hissong et al 2014 any leakage from an ng pipeline may lead to serious environmental and public safety impacts jiang et al 2020 van wijk et al 2014 such as fires explosions and water pollution especially when it comes to background leakages haghighi et al 2012 a background leakage is regarded as occurring when the ratio of the leakage orifice diameter to the pipe diameter is small or the working pressure is low to prevent the ocean from damage in addition to assessment of the long term reliability of pipeline materials it is extremely important to understand that the ng leakage rate and diffusion range of sub sea pipelines is a fundamental factor to be considered in the design and maintenance of safe pipelines and for emergency response nowadays leakage and dispersion estimation for ng pipelines has been attracting significant interests mainly in relation to the physical process by which the leaked gas diffuses in the soil or air many experimental and numerical studies have been conducted focusing on this topic with theoretical and empirical equations being determined however researches on the leakage and diffusion of gas in water required further study in 1998 montiel montiel et al 1998 established a mathematical model of accidental gas release from pipelines as a combination of the classical hole and pipe models for the calculation of gas releases without taking surrounding water into consideration when small leakage occurs the valves located at both ends of the pipeline remain open the leakage flow will reach a steady state when the gas releases to the air lu lu et al 2014 derived a mathematical model to calculate the leakage rate to take the water into consideration a series of experiments were performed to establish the empirical model of which some were conducted in laboratory with the water depth less than 2 m while some were conducted with the water depth below 50 m milgram 1983 engebretsen et al 1997 when the gas releases to the water dou 2015 modified lu s equation using the static pressure in water to replace the atmosphere pressure however as the gas releases to the water there will be a pressure gradient outside instead of being constant which will lead to great errors this fact also exists when the gas releases to the soil taking the soil into consideration ebrahimi moghadam ebrahimi moghadam et al 2016 ebrahimi moghadam et al 2018 derived an equation by fitting the simulation results besides a field experiment was performed in the norwegian sea with water depth of 844 m johansenet al 2001 although the experiments could provide the actual leakage information they cost money with limited experimental conditions cloete et al 2009 the numerical simulation cloete et al 2009 is proposed as an alternative approach that can solve the problems in the experiments the available numerical models include integral model and computational fluid dynamic cfd model several integral models are reported in the literature e g wimalaratne et al 2015 premathilake et al 2016 which were tested by the laboratory and field experiments these models are used to simulate and analyze numerous oil and gas release scenarios in which the subsurface oil or gas release and dispersion have been studied over the years some models are based on the multiphase cfd method a two phase eulerian eulerian cfd model was proposed by buscaglia buscaglia et al 2002 however the pure eulerian eulerian approach was computationally expensive and failed to capture the jet transition in modelling subsea gas release olsen and skjetne 2016a olsen and skjetne 2016b cloete et al 2009 developed a method coupled volume of fluid vof and discrete phase model dpm to simulate the plume and free surface behavior resulting from a sub sea gas pipe rupture olsen and skjetne 2016a olsen and skjetne 2016b simulated the underwater gas plume and free surface behavior which were demonstrated by accurately reproducing a small scale experiment the comparison between previous studies and current study is shown in table 1 the main contribution of this work is to establish the leakage rate calculation and gas dispersion models using the experimental and numerical methods firstly the influences of the pressure leakage orifice diameter and water depth on the leakage rate and gas dispersion process were revealed through experiments further according to the established experimental facilities the numerical models including the integral mathematical model and cfd model were established according to the axial velocity radius and spring height the two model were compared and validated in addition a field simulation using cfd model was conducted to quantify the gas leakage rate and dispersion prediction predicting the rising time and diffusion range the results indicate that the quantifying estimation correlation can predict the leakage rate in the sea 2 methodology 2 1 stress analysis of gas bubbles in water after the gas leaks to the water a gas bubble will be generated firstly which is affected by multiple forces during its growth neglecting the forces in the horizon direction the forces in the vertical direction are cared about including buoyancy f f the difference between buoyancy and gravity momentum force f m flow resistance force f d and surface tension force f σ as shown in fig 1 according to newton s second law ditmars and cederwall 1977 the forces follow 1 f f f m f d f σ m a p where m is the mass of the bubble kg a p is the acceleration m s2 eq 1 is derived based on the fact that in the inertial system the bubble is in a non equilibrium state with a certain acceleration to solve eq 1 the inertial force is introduced and eq 2 is then expressed as 2 f f f m f d f σ f i 0 the buoyancy force ditmars and cederwall 1977 can be expressed as 3 f f π d b 3 6 g ρ w ρ b where d b is the bubble diameter m g is the gravity acceleration m s2 ρ

the rising speed of the bubble m s c d is the resistance coefficient of the bubble movement which is related to the reynolds number r e ρ w u d d p μ w μ w is the dynamic viscosity of water pa s since thein previous investigations many experimental and numerical studies have been conducted with both theoretical and empirical equations being proposed however most present studies focus on gas diffusion in the water neglecting the leakage rate calculation which is very important for calculating the axial velocity plume radius spring height and rising time and surface diffusion area the characteristics as well as the location and size of gas plume underwater were not presented in detail moreover the models currently available for performing leakage dispersion range prediction show a major gap in the range of conditions over which they can be applied with a reasonable degree of accuracy some models were based on the integral model with large errors some models were based on the cfd model with the help of fluent software although both can be applied to portray the diffusion process the advantages and disadvantages between the two methods were not clarified hence calculation of the gas leakage rate from a sub sea pipeline based on experiments and simulations which determines the gas dispersion in the water may be a remarkable contribution to the state of the art moreover comparison between the integral model and cfd model can help us to decide which method should be chosen according to the actual situation when the bubble rises is relatively small the bubble can be regarded as a rigid body regardless of the bubble viscosity c d can be calculated as follows liao et al 2010 6 c d 24 r e 10 4 re 0 4 c d 18 5 r e 0 6 2 re 500 c d 0 44 500 re 2 10 5 the surface tension resistance wang 2006 can be calculated as 7 f σ π d k σ where σ is the interfacial tension coefficient n m when the gas flows into the water through the leakage the acceleration of the bubble will also accelerate the surrounding water which can be regarded as the virtual mass force ditmars and cederwall 1977 8 f i d d t ρ l α ρ w v d u d where v d π d p 3 6 is the bubble volume m3 α is the virtual mass force coefficient during the bubble formation process the bottom of the bubble adheres to the orifice the bubble volume gradually expands as the gas continues to leak into the bubble and the bubble center rises gradually the process is shown in fig 2 a c the expansion rate of bubble radius can be regarded as the rising speed of bubble center then the bubble rising speed can be expressed as ditmars and cederwall 1977 9 u d u 1 d r 1 d t d 3 v 1 4 π 1 3 d t 1 3 3 4 π 1 3 v 1 2 3 d v 1 d t where u 1 is the bubble expansion speed m s r 1 and d 1 are the bubble radius and diameter m v 1 is the bubble volume ditmars and cederwall 1977 which follows eq 10 m3 10 d v 1 d t q v the rising acceleration of the bubble is then expressed as ditmars and cederwall 1977 11 d u d d t 2 q v 2 9 3 4 π 1 3 v 1 5 3 therefore eq 8 can be rewritten as 12 f i ρ b α ρ w v 1 d u 1 d t u d d v 1 d t substituting eq s 9 10 and 11 into 12 yields 13 f i q v 2 3 π d 1 2 ρ b α ρ w eq 2 is modified as 14 π d 1 3 6 g ρ b ρ w 4 ρ l q v 2 π d k 2 q v 2 8 π d 1 2 c d ρ w π d k σ q v 2 3 π d 1 2 ρ b α ρ w 0 eq 14 tells the forces suffered by the bubble before it departs from the leakage orifice as the gas continues to leak into the bubble the bottom of the bubble begins to depart from the leakage orifice through a narrow neck the bubble is connected to the leakage orifice until the neck breaks away this stage could be seen in fig 2 d during the departure process u 2 represents the departure speed of the bubble from the neck m s d 2 is the bubble diameter m v 2 is the bubble volume m3 therefore the bubble rising speed is ditmars and cederwall 1977 15 u d u 1 u 2 where the expansion rate u 1 1 3 3 4 π 1 3 v 2 2 3 d v 2 d t the volume increase of the bubble is the result of the leakage flowrate multiplied by the leakage time if the elongation speed of narrow neck is regarded as constant then ditmars and cederwall 1977 16 u 2 l d q v v 2 v 1 where l d is the length of narrow neck m which is generally considered as l d 0 5 d 2 therefore the rising acceleration of the bubble can be obtained ditmars and cederwall 1977 17 d u d d t d u 1 u 2 d t 2 q v 2 9 3 4 π 1 3 v 2

formed under the momentum jet which can be called as the flow formation zone the initial bubble generates expands departs and rises during which the necking and bulging of the bubble plume can also be observed showing that the bubble has a process of shrinking inward and expanding outward further full development of the plume develops for the second stage which can be called as the shaped flow zone as shown in fig 3 in this stage the self buoyancy of the gas will replace the initial momentum as the dominated force and the impact of the initial momentum on the plume becomes negligible gas rising will cause turbulence which will entrap the surrounding water into the moving plume called the entrainment phenomenon the tip of the plume splits from the middle due to the shearing effect of the water on the plume the entire process is similar to the flower blooming the cut gas will return to the plume body again with the entrainment effect and continues to rise with the plume the fully developed ascending plume will form an inverted cone zone finally there is the surface flow stage when the gas reaches to the surface the entrained water will not flow into the atmosphere with the gas but flows radially outward on the horizontal surface driving the bubbles away from the plume axis this process will cause the water surface to rise forming a spring most gases will continue to flow into the atmosphere forming surface turbulence or boiling called the surface flow zone during the three stages the forces suffered by the plume are related to the leakage flow rate pressure orifice diameter water density and gravity acceleration the forces are also influenced by the frequency of the plume bulging the dimensional analysis method is used to analyze the forces during the plume rising process as shown in the following equation 20 f m d ρ g d p f 0 take the gas momentum flux m d water density ρ and leakage orifice diameter d as the basic dimensions three terms are derived using π theorem to perform a factor analysis yuan as shown in equations 21 23 21 π 1 g ρ l d 3 m d 4 π g ρ l d ρ g v 2 4 π 1 f r 22 π 2 p d 2 m d 4 π p ρ g v 2 4 π e u 23 π 3 f ρ l 1 2 m d 1 2 d 2 4 π

pressure p b at the bottom the weight g w of the water the weight g w of the spring and the buoyancy b as shown in fig 4 the height of the spring on the water surface formed by the gas rising can be calculated by the conservation equation of momentum it is assumed that no vertical momentum flux flows out of the outer boundary for the integral model the balance equation is shown as 35 p a g w g f

empirical coefficients milgram and burgess 1984 spalding 1963 woodward and mudan 1991 in the above equations in the integral model could be set as shown in table 2 in the above section the integral model is established of which the empirical coefficients are given the numerical solution steps of the integral model can be seen in fig 5 2 2 2 theoretical basis of cfd model for underwater gas dispersion 1 a coupled dpm vof model the euler lagrangian model regards the leaked gas as the lagrangian discrete phase and the surrounding water as the continuous euler phase these discrete phase particles flow in the continuous phase and interact with each other by exchanging mass momentum and energy which is also called as the coupled dpm vof model to capture the leaked gas in the water the two phase free surfaces can be tracked by the vof model solving the continuity equation momentum equation and energy equation as seen in the literatures li and chen 2018 li and chen 2016 for the dpm model the leaked gas is regarded as a discrete phase which is tracked by a balancing force applied to the discrete phase particles 2 bubble density and size models as the bubble rises in the water the depth where the bubble is located becomes smaller resulting in that the surrounding pressure changes significantly which leads to the bubble density decrease the density of underwater gas bubble can be expressed as li and chen 2018 li and chen 2016 40 ρ b m b p r t 41 p p 0 ρ l g h p where m b is the relative molecular mass of the leaked gas r is the general gas constant j kmol k p is the hydrostatic pressure suffered by the bubble pa p 0 is the atmospheric pressure pa h p is the water depth where the bubble is located m the bubble size is always regarded as constant in present models to simplify the calculation process however the bubble size varies from moment to moment due to bursting and merging when the bubble rises which leads to the existing model fails to accurately predict the diffusion of the bubble plume characteristics laux laux and johansen 1999 established a bubble size model under the euler frame by solving the transport equation which can predict the diffusion process accurately 3 experimental and simulation 3 1 experimental 3 1 1 experimental setup the experimental system consists of three parts pipeline data collection and underwater leakage parts the flow chart can be seen in fig 6 the total length of the pipeline loop is 251 5 m with the inner diameter of 42 mm the leakage system is mainly composed of a transparent water tank and a leakage section as shown in fig 7 the size of the water tank is 1 1 1 5 m a leakage is simulated by controlling a pneumatic valve on a branch pipe extending from the gas pipeline at the back of the control valve a leakage orifice is installed which controls the leakage flowrates by changing the diameter pressure transducers and mass flow meters are installed at the front and back of the leakage hole a high speed camera is arranged to observe the leakage diffusion process in real time the measuring range of the flowmeter is 0 01 1 nm3 h and the accuracy is 0 2 the measuring range of the pressure transmitter is 0 0 6 mpa and the accuracy is 0 5 fs the fastcam sa x2 high speed camera is chosen equipped with c mos image sensor which can take photos with 1024 1024 pixels at 13 500 frames per second in this study the shooting time is set as 5 s at a speed of 5000 frames per second 3 1 2 experimental scenarios the experiments were carried out under the following conditions the leakage orifice diameter of 1 2 and 3 mm the working pressure of 100 200 and 300 kpa the water depth of 30 60 and 90 cm the direct measured parameters were the leakage orifice size pressure and water depth the uncertainty was given by instrument error the uncertainty of the methane flow rate axial velocity plume radius and spring height should be calculated by the following formula moffat 1988 42 δ y i 1 n f x i δ x i 2 where fig 18 is the uncertainty of the directly measured variable fig 19 is the serial number of each variable to ensure the repeatability and reproducibility of experimental results each experiment was repeated three times of which the average value was calculated and analyzed and the uncertainty of each variable can also be calculated all of which were smaller than 2 5 validating that the experimental setup had acceptable accuracy 3 2 simulation when the water depth was 0 9 m and leakage hole size was 3 mm a three dimensional underwater diffusion model was established with the help of fluent software of which the size was 1 1 1 5 m the leakage orifice was located at the center of the bottom and the grid near the leakage point was refined as shown in fig 8 the calculation area was divided into water and air sections through the patch option the upper boundary of the air was set as the pressure outlet boundary the sides and bottom of the model were set as the non slip solid wall and the leakage hole with a radius of 1 5 mm at the bottom was set as the air mass flow inlet boundary condition in the dpm model corresponding to the leakage flowrate in the experiments the piso algorithm and k ε turbulence model were used it should be noted that bubble density and size for the model was imported by the udf functions to consider the bursting and merging process during gas rising the independence of different mesh grids of 67800 376000 1029000 should be conducted before the simulation when the water depth was 0 9 m and the leakage orifice diameter was 3 mm the results of the plume rising time obtained by different grid numbers and experiment could be seen in fig 9 considering the calculation accuracy and time the model with the grid number of 376 000 was selected for further simulations 4 results and discussion 4 1 experimental results and discussion 4 1 1 leakage rate when the pressure was 100 kpa with the leakage orifice diameter of 2 mm and the water depth of 90 cm the flow fluctuations were measured by flowmeter 1 and 2 as shown in fig 10 when there was no leakage the flow rates of the two flowmeters remained basically consistent at 16 59 nm3 h at about 20 s as the leakage valve opened instantly the flow rate of flowmeter 1 started to rise while that of flowmeter 2 started to decrease sharply after the leakage was stable for about 60 s as the leakage valve was closed the flow rates in the pipeline returned to the original value again the leakage flow could be calculated by the differences between the two measured flows during stable state pressure changes were recorded by transmitter 1 and 2 as shown in fig 11 when there was no leakage the pressure of transmitter 1 stabilized at 100 kpa and that of transmitter 2 stabilized at 99 17 kpa after the leakage valve opened instantly at about 20 s both dropped sharply and stabilized at about 40 s after being stable for 60 s as the leakage valve was closed the pressures returned to the original value again both the flow variation trend and the pressure change trend coincide with those of the pipeline with leakage into the air at 100 kpa the relationship between the leakage rate and the leakage hole diameter is seen in fig 12 when the water depth is 90 cm the relationship between the leakage rate and the pressure level is shown in fig 13 for a leakage hole diameter of 3 mm the relationship between the leakage rate and the water depth is shown in fig 14 in fig 12 the leakage rate increases with the increase of leakage hole size which approximately follows a kind of power function relationship moreover as the water depth increases the influence of the leakage hole on the leakage rate will be weakened in fig 13 the leakage rate increases with the increase of pressure which approximately follows a linear relationship and as the leakage hole size increases the slope gets larger in fig 14 the leakage rate decreases with the increase of water depth without an obvious function relationship comparing these three figures the change of the hole diameter has the greatest influence on the leakage rate followed by the pressure and the influence of the water depth is the smallest which were validated by the results shown in li s research li et al 2019 li and han 2020 4 1 2 underwater gas diffusion process at 100 kpa with the leakage orifice diameter of 1 mm and water depth of 90 cm the plume in the water could be seen in fig 15 in fig 15 the plumes successively went through the process of bubble generation expansion rupture and rising cycle which could also be seen in fig 16 when the pressure was 300 kpa with the leakage orifice diameter of 3 mm and water depth of 60 cm comparing these two conditions as the pressure and leakage hole diameter get larger and the water depth becomes smaller the initial momentum of the bubble plume will become larger and the diffusion of the bubble plume in the water will change from the bubble form to the small air mass moreover the effect of the shearing resistance of the water during the ascent is also reduced so that the axial ascending velocity of the plume becomes larger resulting in a decrease in the rise time and an increase in the fountain height on the water surface at the same time the radial diffusion velocity increases which makes the diffusion angle of the bubble plume increase and leads to the corresponding increase of the plume diameter the detailed influences on the gas diffusion process could be seen as follows 4 1 3 influencing factors on underwater gas diffusion 1 influence on axial velocity when the leakage hole diameter was 3 mm with the water depth of 90 cm the plumes at 100 200 and 300 kpa could be recorded as shown in fig 17 in fig 17 a at 100 kpa when the gas leakage rate was small the bubble plume was relatively sparse the diffusion radius and the spring height were also small and the time required by the plume to rise to the water surface was 1 46 s as the pressure increased the consumed time decreased while the other parameters increased which was validated by the results shown in li s research li et al 2019 li and han 2020 to describe the influences more clearly the axial velocity dispersion radius and spring height of the bubble plume were chosen to be calculated imagej image software was used to draw the pictures of consecutive frames from the saved plume videos the plume height difference of two consecutive picture was divided by the interval time calculating the axial velocity the depth of 9 monitoring points was 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 and 90 cm the axial velocity distribution of bubble plume could be obtained in table 3 and fig 18 the axial velocity increased with the increase of pressure and leakage orifice diameter while decreased with the increase of water depth the reason for this trend mainly results from the fact that as the pressure and leakage hole diameter get larger and the water depth becomes smaller the initial momentum of the bubble plume will become larger and the resistance of the water will become weak 2 influence on radius the radius of bubble plume could be obtained in table 4 and fig 19 the plume radius increased with the increase of pressure water depth and leakage orifice diameter the relation between the radius and the depth follows the linear function as the pressure and leakage hole diameter get larger the initial momentum of the bubble plume will become larger and as the water depth increases the resistance of the water will become stronger both contribute to the increase of the plume radius 3 influence on spring height when the water depth was 90 cm with the leakage orifice diameter of 3 mm the spring heights under different pressures could be obtained in fig 20 when the pressure was 100 200 and 300 kpa respectively the spring height reached the maximum value of 11 9 14 5 and 16 9 cm at 1 9 s 1 4 s and 1 2 s respectively the maximum spring heights under different conditions could be obtained as shown in fig 21 the spring height increased with the increase of pressure and leakage orifice diameter the relation between the spring height and the pressure follows the linear function 4 2 numerical results and discussion of integral model and cfd model when the leakage flowrate was 0 75 m3 h the cfd simulation results could be seen in fig 22 compared to the experimental results in fig 22 the plumes successively went through the process of bubble generation expansion rupture and rising cycle the plume obtained by cfd simulation agrees well with the experimental one in three diffusion stages as the leakage rate decreased the initial momentum of the bubble plume decreased leading to the decrease of the axial velocity the axial velocity with leakage rate of 0 21 and 0 37 m3 h obtained by cfd model integral model and experiments could be seen in fig 23 in fig 23 as the water depth increased the axial velocity decreased when the depth was constant as the leakage flow rate increased from 0 21 to 0 37 m3 h the axial velocity increased the axial velocity of the integral model was basically the same as the experimental one the result of cfd simulation was larger than the experimental one and as the water depth increased they got closer this resulted from the fact that the cfd model based on the reynolds time averaged turbulence method ignored the dissolution of gas in water and viscous forces between the bubbles and water the numerical results could be validated by the experimental results which indicated that both of the integral model and cfd model could be applied to calculate the axial velocity distribution in addition the radius could be obtained by the numerical models as shown in fig 24 in fig 24 as the water depth increased the radius increased when the depth was constant as the leakage flow rate increased from 0 21 to 0 37 m3 h the radius varied little the radius predicted by the integral model was basically the same as the experimental one while that of cfd simulation was slightly larger which indicated that both of the integral model and cfd model could be applied to calculate the plume radius besides the axial velocity and the radius the spring was also obtained as shown in fig 25 in fig 25 the spring could be depicted by the cfd model and experiments through high speed camera moreover the spring heights could be calculated by processing the figures for the integral model although the figure couldn t be drawn the spring height distribution in the radial direction on the water surface could be calculated directly of which the results could be seen in fig 26 when the water depth was 1 1 m in fig 26 the spring heights in the center line were obtained by the integral model which were 0 0508 0 0748 and 0 1305 m for the leakage rates of 0 21 0 37 and 0 84 m3 h respectively friedl friedl and fannelop 2000 established a relationship between the maximum spring height the average initial one and the center one calculated by the integral model as shown in eqs 43 and 44 43 h p 2 h f 44 h p max 3 1 h f thereafter the maximum and initial spring heights could be calculated likewise the initial spring height and maximum spring height of the cfd model and experiments can be obtained as shown in fig 27 in fig 27 as the leakage rate increased both of the initial and maximum spring heights increased moreover the errors between the numerical models and experiments could be calculated the average relative error of cfd model was 8 9 while that of the integral model was 17 2 which indicated that the cfd model had advantage over the integral model in calculating the spring heights from the results of axial velocity radius spring height the cfd model and the integral model are both effective to obtain the underwater gas diffusion process which were validated by the experimental results the cfd model could draw the visible diffusion figures and is affected little by its parameters although there are some assumptions and the results of the cfd model are more accurate than those of the integral model in the calculations of spring height however it wastes time the integral model saves time without drawing diffusion figures which is also influenced by the empirical parameters and when calculating the axial velocity and plume radius the errors of both of the cfd model and integral model are small therefore to obtain the detailed information and draw the leakage and diffusion process during researches the cfd model is the option however when we have to calculate the dispersion process as soon as possible to provide timely response strategy for the accidents the integral model can be applied 4 3 case study 4 3 1 leak rate prediction from the experimental study on the leakage rate the influencing factors on the leakage rate were revealed through the numerical study on the diffusion process the integral model and cfd model were validated in this section a large scale field pipeline was chosen for which the cfd simulation was conducted to establish the leakage rate and diffusion models the leakage hole diameters in the simulation were set as 5 10 15 and 20 mm the water depth was 5 10 15 and 20 m and the pressures were 3000 5000 7000 and 9000 kpa the relations between the leakage rate and the pressure orifice diameter water depth could be obtained respectively the correlations between the leakage rates and the three influencing factors were the same as those obtained in the laboratory experiments the leakage rate increased exponentially with the leakage orifice diameter linearly with the pressure and decreases with the increase of water depth for background leakages lu et al 2014 xie et al 2015 according to the fitted empirical equation for the buried gas pipelines ebrahimi moghadam et al 2016 the leakage rate of underwater gas pipelines could be calculated as 45 q 0 0591 h 750 9 0 951 0 167 d 1 8 p 0 95 where q is the leakage rate m3 h h is the water depth m d is the leakage orifice diameter mm p is the pressure kpa to verify the accuracy of eq 45 when the soil depth for the equation in literature ebrahimi moghadam et al 2016 and the water depth for eq 45 were both 0 the calculated leakage rates could be seen in fig 28 the errors of the established empirical leakage rate model in this study were less than 18 63 4 3 2 leakage diffusion process firstly the bubble plume velocity distribution in radial and axial directions was analyzed when the water depth was 15 m as shown in figs 29 and 30 respectively in fig 29 the radial velocity of the plume followed approximately gaussian function which validated the assumptions in the integral model in fig 30 the relationship between the axial velocity and water depth was the same as that obtained in experiments likewise the relation between the radius and the water depth was the same when the full scale water depth was considered the time consumed by the gas bubble reached to the water surface and the diffusion range on the surface were both of great significance to predict the leakage consequences which could provide solutions for the response strategy when the water depth was 15 m the time and the diffusion radius could be presented as 14 1 s and 3 9 m for 352 m3 h 10 6 s and 4 4 m for 735 m3 h 7 0 s and 5 4 m for 1116 m3 h 5 9 s and 6 5 m for 1469 m3 h 3 8 s and 8 1 m for 1852 m3 h as the leakage rate increased the time consumed got shorter while the diffusion radius increased 5 conclusions in this study a leakage rate estimation model and a dispersion prediction model were developed for sub sea gas pipelines using experimental and numerical simulation methods the following conclusions were drawn 1 the influences of the pressure leakage orifice diameter and water depth on the leakage rate and gas dispersion process were revealed through experiments the quantifying estimation correlation which can predict the leakage rate in the sea was established through the numerical models the errors were less than 16 47 2 the numerical models including the integral mathematical model and computational fluid dynamic model were established which were validated by the axial velocity radius and spring height the relative error for the spring height calculations of cfd model was 8 9 while that of the integral model was 17 2 3 the rising time and diffusion range of the leaked gas could be predicted by the established numerical models the results indicate that the computational fluid dynamic model could predict the dispersion process more accurately with more detailed information while the integral mathematical model could predict the dispersion process more quickly and directly 4 in the future the rising time and dispersion range could be calculated considering the ocean current moreover if the leaked gas above the water is ignited the consequences should be predicted to broadcast a warning

21532,vibration response and damping effects on flexible aluminum tube placed in tube bundle under fluid interaction velocity of 0 5 m s using water tunnel is analyzed experimentally for drag and lift direction the study is undertaken to reduce the flow induced instabilities in heat exchanger proposing low vibrating design approach therefore three tube bundles in triangular arrangement using

vibrations show decreasing trend with increase in support plate thickness respectively moreover successive decrease in natural frequency of tube 9 6 hz influence the damping factors to increase for each tube bundle based on assessment it is noted that tube bundle comprising 3 6 mm thick support plate along 8 hz natural frequency shows maximum stability for given setup keywords water tunnel flow

heat exchangers are extensively utilized in oil and gas industry yang et al 2020 as well as nuclear sector due to their simple structure and multi purpose application under a wide range of working pressure naqvi et al 2019 the fluid interaction forces and flow velocity which are directly related to reynolds number and strouhal number are considered one of most critical aspect for the vibrations point of view goyder 2002a further the tube motion indicates intermittent to chaotic behavior with the increase in the flow pitch velocity lai et al 2020 that eventually leads to the short life span and damage of the heat exchanger quan et al 2019 beside this the flow induced vibrations play a positive role to increase the heat transfer rate duan et al 2016 2020 by increasing the fluid turbulence and reducing the temperature layer around the tubes of the shell and tube heat exchanger su et al 2016 2019 however this phenomenon is limited to the fact that if the flow induced vibrations increase up to a critical level large energy will be transferred which will lead to the high amplitude of acceleration in tube wang et al 2019 the large acceleration further generates instability in heat exchanger in both shell and tube side khushnood and nizam 2017 like severe tube leakage problem weaver et al 1988 collision damage and eventually the damage of entire tube bundle weaver and fitzpatrick 1988 khushnood et al 2012 therefore the vibration analysis under the interaction of tube and flowing fluid are believed to be more significant in comparison with the heat transfer applications pettigrew and taylor 2003a few researchers have presented their study to reduce the flow induced vibrations with enhanced heat transfer through different configurations and design approach as large amplitude of vibrations are not accepted in industrial sector in any case since it can lead to the brutal damage of the equipment goyder 2002b and further widen the path towards the sudden unplanned shutdown of the plant which is practically undesirable for instance a novel anti vibrating hexagonal clamping baffle plate is analyzed through cfd analysis under the influence of velocity baffle distance and profile for the heat transfer enhancement of shell and tube heat exchanger yu et al 2018 moreover in another study the motion of the tubes are investigated under different tube configurations for distinct p d ratio at variable flow velocities in cross flow direction of the fully immersed tubes wang et al 2019 furthermore in a simulation study the flow induced vibrations are studied in terms of vibration amplitude and frequency in cross flow direction and validated under three different flow velocities brockmeyer et al 2019 12 in another simulation study the impact of unsteady fluid forces are investigated on the tube bundle through forced vibration method in a triangular tube bundle geometry with a pitch ratio of 1 32 the study highlights that the lift force is mainly caused by the amplitude of the tube itself and is less effected by the degree of freedom in rotation and vibration direction chen et al 2020 likewise the vibrational displacement and frequency spectra of the first row of the tubes were investigated experimentally through the support plate and anti vibration bars quan et al 2019 moreover the vibrational amplitude and heat transfer effects were studied through a configuration of anti vibrational baffle plate under flow conditions for parallel flow shell and tube heat exchangers yu et al 2019 04 furthermore a simulation analysis is performed to increase and decrease the heat transfer rate and flow induced vibrations respectively through different design and configuration of baffle plates naqvi et al 2019 another study based on the heat transfer enhancement and vibration response of flexible tube of heat exchanger is investigated numerically ji et al 2016 08 while applying dynamic parameters through different tube size tube mass and flowing fluid the added mass is one of the unavoidable aspect in flow induced vibrations that varies the overall natural frequency and mode shapes of the system weaver 1993 moretti and lowery 1976 similarly lower diameter of channel reduces the vortex induced vibration that eventually increases the lift force in the vibrating tube zang and gao 2014 it is studied further that both the amplitude of vibration and pitch to diameter ratio drastically impact the lift coefficient pettigrew and taylor 2003b blevins and vibration 1990 moreover an experimental and numerical study on fluid elastic instability highlights that the time delay factor considerably depends on the critical velocity at generally low the void fraction lai et al 2020 03 lai et al 2020 09 the above studies fairly indicate the importance of the analysis of flow induced vibration therefore the current study is undertaken to experimentally analyze the vibration response and damping effects on the flexible aluminum tube under three distinct tube bundles comprised of intermediate support plates of thickness i e 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm respectively the damping analysis is investigated for the central tube of three tube bundles having distinct support plates under varying natural frequency of 9 8 7 and 6 hz respectively whereas the vibration response analysis is further performed at a fixed natural frequency of 8 hz through a novel approach by using closed loop water tunnel which is not previously reported however there exist some studies based on the analysis through vibration exciters using different tube material geometry and flow pattern under controlled conditions whereas in this study the extensive vibration and damping behavior of aluminum tube in a triangular pattern under fully flooded fluid interaction in cross flow pattern is performed the research further highlights the overall comparison of damping factors through three different intermediate support plates under four different natural frequencies leading to the conclusive trend that which arrangement is favorable for increasing the damping effects to control the vibrating phenomena for system stability therefore the current investigation can be considered as a significant contribution in the research for the efficient design of shell and tube heat exchanger 2 fluid elastic models to significantly investigate the impact of flow induced vibrations on interacting tube bundle several fluid elastic instability models have been proposed by the researchers for instance a model was proposed to explain the motion of cylindrical tube in the flowing fluid by using laplace s equation given as rao and yap 2011 1 d 2 x d τ 2 2 ζ d x d τ x ρ u 2 2 m ω n 2 0 717 1 c b p x τ 2 ω n d u 1 c b p m e a n d k d x where m d τ and cbp are mass outer diameter of tube non dimensional time and base pressure coefficient respectively a more simple and elementary stable model was proposed by applying energy balance for inline flow and transverse flow direction given as connors 1970 2 u f d k 2 π ξ m ρ d 2 0 5 here k indicates a constant its value was evaluated through distinct techniques the stability criteria was further modified to evaluate the value of k for both fluid damping controlled instability and fluid elastic stiffness controlled instability given as chen 1983a 3 u f v d 4 c g v 2 π ξ v m v ρ d 2 4 u f w d 4 c g w 2 π ξ w m w ρ d 2 equations 3 and 4 represents the stability model of the fluid damping controlled instability for both in vacuum and in still fluid respectively similarly the stability models for the fluid elastic stiffness controlled instability are represented by equations 5 and 6 given as 5 u f v d 2 π c f v 2 π ξ v m v ρ d 2 0 5 6 u f w d 2 π c f w 2 π ξ w m w ρ d 2 0 5 moreover equations 3 6 can be summarized in a combined function form as equation 7 7 u f v d f 2 π ξ v m v ρ d 2 m v ρ d 2 t d p n d t u r b u l e n c e c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s furthermore in another study the fluid damping controlled instability and fluid elastic stiffness controlled instability mechanism are further highlighted chen 1983b the friction between the support plate and vibrating tube yields greater damping at relatively low vibration amplitude a simple and applicable damping model related to the support plate thickness t span length l and number of spans n is developed given as pettigrew and taylor 2003c 8 ζ 5 n 1 n t l 0 5 3 the system description 3 1 experimental setup the vibration response and damping analysis is carried out through the closed loop low speed water tunnel with a fully flooded flow at a velocity of 0 5 m s the complete system consists of five main parts i e low speed water tunnel aluminum test tube bundle 10 hp motor with centrifugal pump water storage tank and tri axial accelerometer the schematic diagram of the experimental process loop with main components is illustrated in fig 1 the complete process of the system is defined as follow the water is extracted from the water tank through the suction line and accelerated with the help of a centrifugal pump coupled with 10 hp electric motor the water is then supplied ahead in the divergent section of the water tunnel through a pump delivery line here the pressure of the water is increased by decreasing the velocity of the fluid a flow straightener section is positioned among the metallic divergent and convergent section comprised of the honeycomb structure to keep the flow inline and uniform with a maximum turbulence intensity of 3 the convergent section is used to provide fully flooded uniform flow of water with a velocity of 0 5 m s two throttling globe valves are used in the delivery and recirculation line to control the inlet and outlet water flow rate in the test section of water tunnel the test section is made up of acrylic plates of 0 5 mm thickness for the vibrational analysis of central tube placed in a tube bundle here the flowing fluid interacts with the flexible test tube bundle which allows the tube to vibrate by the transmission of fluid force in both drag inline flow and lift transverse flow direction after interacting with the flexible tube bundle the water is returned in the storage tank through a recirculation line for cyclic closed loop operation the physical experimental setup of the water tunnel with the tube bundle for vibration and damping analysis is presented in fig 2 the pump suction inlet is coupled with the water storage tank though suction line whereas the delivery line of the pump is coupled with the inlet of the divergent section of the water tunnel the divergent section is used at the inlet of the water tunnel to increase the pressure and decrease the velocity of the flowing fluid as the study is undertaken on a relatively low water speed i e 0 5 m s a flow straightener comprised of honeycomb structure is employed in the water tunnel to produce the smooth inline flow stream moreover the inlet of the test section is coupled with the convergent section to attain fully flooded fluid flow the test section of water tunnel is used for the vibration and damping analysis of aluminum test tube bundle with a dimension of 200 mm 100 mm the tube generated vibration signals are sensed through the accelerometer placed at the top of the test tube labeled as 1 in fig 2 moreover the close loop of fluid in the water tunnel is attained by incorporating a recirculation line at the end of test section through which the water is collected again in the storage tank for the sake of reuse moreover the specifications of the experimental apparatus low speed closed loop water tunnel are given in table 1 the physical setup and linkage mechanism of aluminum test tube bundle along with the position of support plate and accelerometer is represented in fig 3 the presented flexible aluminum test tube bundle with the intermediate support plate is used for the vibration and damping analysis moreover the support plate is placed in the middle of the tube bundle the aluminum tubes are placed in a parallel tri angular arrangement in tube bundle with a fixed pitch to diameter p d ratio of 1 45 whereas the wall thickness of 0 9 mm is used for all the tubes in entire experimentation for the linkage of whole tube bundle assembly two acrylic plates are placed at the top and bottom of the tubes in the form of pair for rigid supporting with the help of supporting studs whereas the central test tube is passed throughout the upper acrylic sheet in order to sense the vibrations through accelerometer where it is supported by the tensioning nut as can be seen in fig 3 a b moreover the central monitored tube is grabbed from the bottom of the assembly by passing a piano wire through a pin hole in the tube above 1 5 mm from the bottom of tube bundle further the piano wire is tightened at the bottom through a nut and a washer labeled as 9 in fig 3 c additionally a closed view of the top and bottom of the tube bundle is presented in fig 3 b c respectively furthermore another acrylic sheet is placed at the top of the supporting studs to aid the tensioning mechanism for the adjustment of natural frequency of the central tube for this purpose a tensioning nut is installed at the top of the tube bundle labeled as 1 in fig 3 for tuning the desired natural frequency of the tube at 6 hz 7 hz 8 hz and 9 hz the tensioning nut is tightened or loosened which eventually exerts a force on the central tube with the aid of 0 2 mm thick piano wire for the determination of the tuned natural frequency the central tube is firstly set to the free vibrations after placing the tube bundle into the test section of the water tunnel and the tube generated vibrations are captured through the tri axial accelerometer these signals are further transferred to the laptop installed with node commander where they are decoded through sig view software to obtain the actual value of tuned natural frequency to analyze the vibration response of the central monitored tube for three distinct tube bundles comprised of support plates of 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm the central tube is tuned to 8 hz natural frequency however for the implementation of tuned natural frequency in the experiment the tube bundle is placed in the test section of the water tunnel where the central tube is vibrated through the interaction of flowing fluid at a velocity of 0 5 m s as shown in fig 2 whereas the generated vibrations are sensed through tri axial accelerometer for both drag and lift direction further for the implementation of the four natural frequencies i e 9 8 7 and 6 hz to evaluate damping factors the half bandwidth method is adopted for each tube bundle with support plate thickness of 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm respectively moreover the half bandwidth method is elaborated through fig 12 and equation 11 is used to calculate the damping ratio a top view of the tube bundle is presented in fig 4 it can be seen that the tubes are arranged in a triangular arrangement in which the highlighted tube represents the central monitored test tube the central test tube is mounted with wireless tri axial accelerometer to monitor the vibration response in both y and x direction which indicates the inline flow drag and the transverse flow lift direction respectively the design and geometry of the intermediate support plate is represented in fig 5 the experimentation is carried out separately through three different intermediate support plates in terms of their thickness i e 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm that are shown in fig 5 a b and c respectively the outer dimension of the support plate is kept constant for all the three intermediate support plates as 85 mm 85 mm it is important to highlight that the inner diameter of the central hole of the intermediate support plate is 13 2 mm whereas the inner diameter of all the remaining holes are kept at 12 7 mm the central hole of the support plate is designed i e 13 2 mm in such a manner to provide a clearance of 0 5 mm between the central tube outer diameter and the support plate hole inner diameter for the significant development of squeeze film besides this the remaining holes are kept purposely at 12 7 mm in diameter to provide transition fit in between the support plate holes and tubes of the bundle to grab the intermediate support plate at a fixed position moreover the specifications of the test tube bundle and intermediate support plate are listed in table 2 3 2 measurement procedure of experimentation in the present research work three triangular arrangement tube bundles having distinct intermediated support plates with a pitch to diameter ratio p d of 1 45 is used to examine the vibration response and damping effects by the interaction of the flowing fluid the central tube of the bundle is analyzed through g link tri axial accelerometer placed at the top of the test tube due to the fact that the central tube experience a large amplitude of vibrations with maximum flow irregularities the monitored tube is made flexible for the desired natural frequency with an uncertainty of 0 1 hz by tensioning the 0 2 mm thick piano wire in a special arrangement as shown in fig 3 whereas the three support plates of the thickness 2 2 8 and 3 6 mm are designed separately for the analysis the vibration signals are captured and transmitted through the accelerometer to the wsda base station connected with the laptop computer installed with node commander these signals are then decoded by the sig view software to analyze the obtained results a data acquisition loop of the system is represented in fig 6 the current research work is comprised of two pivotal analysis i e vibration response analysis and damping analysis for the three distinct triangular aluminum tube bundles using low speed water tunnel for both drag inline flow direction and lift transverse flow direction for vibration response analysis the dataset is recorded for 18 distinct period of times for every 30 min interval up to a maximum duration of 3 h for both drag inline flow and lift transverse flow directions these datasets are obtained at fixed natural frequency of 8 hz for the monitored test tube under three intermediate support plate thickness as the tube bundle interacts with the flowing fluid distinct patterns of vibration response are generated according to the tuned natural frequency i e 8 hz subjected to different intermediate support plate thickness used in the tube bundle moreover the extensive damping analysis in terms of damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number is further performed for 12 different setups of test tube bundles comprised of the three distinct intermediate support plate thickness i e 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm under four natural frequencies of the monitored tube at 9 8 7 and 6 hz respectively it is important to highlight that the said natural frequencies are associated with the central monitored aluminum tube of tube bundle labeled as 7 as shown in fig 3 a whereas the natural frequency of monitored tube for each setup is determined through accelerometer by setting the tube free vibrations as described in detail earlier finally the obtained results of the vibration response and damping factors for drag and lift are analyzed to conclude the overall behavior of the monitored aluminum tube 4 results and discussion 4 1 vibration response analysis moving fluid while going through the flexible tube centrally positioned in the tube bundle exerts force depending upon the flow speed and intermediate support plate thickness which allows the tube to displace from its original position the exerted force is responsible for the tube vibration in both drag inline flow and lift transverse flow direction the vibration effects are presented in the form of both vibration response and damping effects in the tube in the first step the signal acceleration behavior for the three tube bundles having distinct intermediate support plate thicknesses i e 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm is presented these signals are represented for the time interval of 10 s at a fixed natural frequency of 8 0 1 hz for each case fig 7 represents the oscillation motion of the tube in both drag inline flow direction and lift transverse flow direction under the influence of flowing fluid for the support plate thickness of 2 mm it can be seen that the tube accelerates with large amplitude in lift direction as compare to the drag direction the maximum observed variation in the acceleration is around 1 6 m s2 and 2 5 m s2 for drag and lift respectively moreover the variation is somewhat irregular in both cases when the support plate thickness is kept low at 2 mm moreover it is important to highlight that the tube begins to decelerate as the thickness of the intermediate support plate increases this is due to the fact that with the increase in the thickness of the intermediate support plate the area of the squeeze film between the outer surface of the tube and inner surface of the support plate increases which ultimately increase and decrease the damping ratio and vibrational acceleration respectively fig 8 represents the acceleration signal behavior of the central tube of bundle in case of 2 8 mm intermediate support plate thickness it can be observed that the signal accelerates between 1 m s2 and 2 m s2 for drag and lift respectively the variation of the acceleration signal is significantly low for 2 8 mm as compared to 2 mm support plate thickness which shows that the tube is vibrating for a lower amplitude as compared to the plate thickness of 2 mm thus approaching to a more stable condition upon the increase in the intermediate support plate thickness fig 9 further highlights the acceleration behavior of the signal in case of tube bundle with 3 6 mm intermediate support plate thickness as observed earlier the system follows the same trend of decreasing acceleration as compared to both the previous cases i e for spt 2 mm and spt 2 8 mm the maximum observed values for the acceleration in case of drag and lift are around 0 9 m s2 and 1 8 m s2 respectively the resulted signal trend highlights that the system experience a more stable condition in case of support plate thickness of 3 6 mm due to the further increase in the area of squeeze film between the tube and support plate it is much important to highlight that there is a limitation for the thickness of the intermediate support plate due to the fact that increasing the thickness of the plate will also increase the mass of the system which ultimately lead to the further irreversibility in the system therefore in this case the maximum thickness of 3 6 mm is suggested to overcome the vibrational issues of the tube bundle operated under fully flooded fluid flow with the velocity of 0 5 m s the tube response is further explained by its rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude the rms acceleration value is of much importance in sinusoidal wave form representation in vibration analysis moreover the dimensionless magnitude is calculated through the following relation given as 9 ψ a y d here a y is the amplitude of vibrations in m which is further evaluated for the calculation of dimensionless magnitude through the following relationship given as khalifa et al 2012 10 10 a y α r m s 4 π 2 f n 2 for the determination of rms acceleration m s2 the tube bundle is placed in the test section of the water tunnel along with the accelerometer fixed at the top of the central tube of the bundle in a vertical direction as shown in fig 2 under fluid interaction with the tube bundle the generated vibrations of the central aluminum tube are captured by the accelerometer which transmit wireless signals to the base station the signals are then further transferred to the laptop installed with node commander where they are decoded using sig view software the rms value of acceleration for each tube bundle setup is obtained respectively this rms value is then used to calculate the amplitude of the tube using equation 10 the rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude for drag inline flow direction is represented in fig 10 for the three distinct intermediate support plate thickness the data is recorded at every 30 min interval for a maximum duration of 180 min for each support plate thickness i e 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm it is important to highlight that both the rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude for drag follows a decreasing trend for every 30 min successive interval of time for the three intermediate support plate thickness this is due to the fact that the system develops a more smooth flow stream at maximum stability when operated for an extensive time period moreover the increase in the intermediate support plate thickness tends to decrease the rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude of the tube the support plate with smaller thickness i e 2 mm shows the largest rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude value and the support plate of thickness 3 6 mm shows the smallest rms acceleration value this is due to the fact that the squeeze film thickness between the tube and support plate increases with the increase in the support plate thickness which eventually increases the damping effect of the tube the minimum observed values of rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude are around 0 81 m s2 0 03 0 8 m s2 0 03 and 0 7 m s2 0 02 for the intermediate support plate thickness of 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm respectively this simply highlights that the tube vibrates with low amplitude for large value of intermediate support plate thickness both the rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude shows a decreasing trend when observed for every successive increase in the time span of experimentation i e from 30 min to 180 min the tube response is further explained in terms of rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude for the lift transverse flow direction as observed in fig 11 both the parameters for lift figures out almost the same accelerating trend as observed earlier for drag however it can be seen that greater intermediate support plate thickness considerably drops the rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude in lift direction as compared to the drag direction moreover both the rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude for lift direction is considerably large as compared to the drag direction the support plate with smaller thickness i e 2 mm shows the largest value and the support plate of thickness of 3 6 mm shows the smallest value for both rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude respectively the minimum observed value of rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude are around 1 97 m s2 0 06 1 75 m s2 0 05 and 1 74 m s2 0 05 for the intermediate support plate thickness of 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm respectively this indicate that the tube vibrates with low amplitude for large value of intermediate support plate thickness in lift direction as well both the rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude follows a decreasing trend with the passage of time and shows the highest values for the first 30 min for all the three support plate thicknesses i e 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm furthermore it is concluded that the observed rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude in drag direction is always smaller than that of lift direction the trend highlights that the tube displace with large amplitude in lift direction as compared to the drag direction moreover the above analysis shows that the tube stability is higher for the large support plate thickness i e spt 3 6 mm for both the drag and lift direction it is also observed that the tube shows more instability in lift direction as compare to drag direction for each support plate thickness hence lift direction analysis is considered to be the utmost critical concern to remove instabilities 4 2 damping analysis the flowing fluid field changes by passing through the flexible triangular tube bundle geometry and exerts some force which is responsible for the vibration of the tube in a tube bundle the fluid force is controlled by the damping force of the tube bundle which stabilizes the tube bundle back to its initial position there will be no vibration if the damping force is greater than the fluid force the damping force is mainly dependent upon the material geometry and thickness of the tube and intermediate support plate beside all of the factors the intermediate support plate thickness is highlighted as a major damping element for the efficient control of the tube vibrations the tube bundle fairly experience a more stable condition in terms of vibrational amplitude with the increase in the tube support plate thickness kim et al 1989 the half bandwidth method is used to calculate the damping ratio for different time periods according to this method the damping ratio ζ can be calculated as iqbal 2010 11 ζ f 2 f 1 2 f n where f n natural frequency of the signals in hz at maximum amplitude of the signal x max f 1 frequency value in hz at x max 2 of 3 db down from peak value lower than f n f2 frequency value in hz at xmax 2 of 3 db down from peak value higher than fn the x max is the maximum amplitude of signals in db and x max 2 is the value of the amplitude below 3 db down from x max as represented in fig 12 the logarithmic curve shows how rapidly the amplitude of vibrations decay moreover the damping of structure will be high if the vibration decays more rapidly khushnood and nizam 2017 the damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number against the intermediate support plate thickness for drag is represented in fig 13 the data is represented for the fixed natural frequency of the tube at 8 hz for drag direction under three support plate thicknesses i e 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm it can be seen that the central monitored tube exhibits higher damping as intermediate support plate thickness increases thus increase in the intermediate support plate thickness tends to increase the stability of the tube bundle this is because of the increase in the squeeze film area which eventually forms a damping layer around the outer surface of tube the large squeeze film area dissipates more energy and decreases the vibrational amplitude which tend to increase the overall damping phenomenon the scruton number is another dimensionless damping parameter used to study the damping behavior of the tube subjected to the flow induced vibrations it is also termed as mass damping or reduced damping that is equal to the product of mass ratio and damping factor blevins 1977 moreover the scruton number shows the inverse relation with the amplitude of the vibration therefore larger the value of the scruton number of the tube smaller will be the amplitude of displacement and vice versa the scruton number is evaluated through the following relationship given as hansen 2007 12 s c 2 m 2 π ζ ρ d 2 the tube bundle damping analysis is further evaluated in terms of logarithmic decrement δ it is defined as the rate of energy dissipation of vibration in the tube and can be calculated from damping ratio chowdhury et al 2000 as follows 13 δ 2 π ζ 1 ζ 2 the above relation shows that the amplitude of vibration will decline rapidly under higher energy dissipation rate moreover for the damping ratio 1 the above relation can be expressed as 14 δ 2 π ζ fig 13 highlights that the maximum damping effect is produced through the support plate thickness of 3 6 mm due to the increases in the area of the squeeze film between the tube and support plate hole the maximum value of damping ratio ζ logarithmic decrement δ and scruton number sc are observed to be 0 12 0 73 and 0 65 for the plate thickness of 3 6 mm in the drag direction respectively whereas the minimum value of all the three factors are observed for the plate thickness of 2 mm it is also important to highlight that the maximum change for all the three factors is observed when the support plate thickness increases from 2 mm to 2 8 mm although the plate thickness of 3 6 mm exhibits the highest value for ζ δ and sc but the difference between the values are observed to be less when the plate thickness increases from 2 8 mm to 3 6 mm fig 14 shows the behavior of damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number along the three intermediate support plate thickness for lift direction it can be seen that the damping effect produced in the lift direction is slightly higher as compared to the drag direction the squeeze film impacts on both lift and drag to significantly increase the damping effects on the tube under fully flooded fluid flow of 0 5 m s the scruton number and logarithmic decrement are also higher in the lift direction as compared to the drag direction although the trend is much similar for this case also in which the maximum and minimum damping is also observed on 3 6 mm and 2 mm support plate thickness respectively the maximum value for damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number are observed to be around 0 14 0 9 and 0 8 for support plate thickness of 3 6 mm respectively which shows that the 3 6 mm support plate thickness shows higher damping effects and tends to stable the system for the natural frequency of 8 hz in lift direction also moreover the above analysis also highlights that the damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number have larger value for lift direction rather than drag direction which indicates that support plate thickness phenomena is more significant to reduce the instabilities in lift direction as compared to drag direction as the natural frequency is of prime concern to evaluate the response of the vibrating body of the system in terms of both the amplitude of vibration and the damping factor therefore the damping effects of the tube are further investigated using three distinct support plate thicknesses 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm under four different natural frequencies i e 9 hz 8 hz 7 hz and 6 hz respectively the analysis further enhance the visualization aspect to estimate the overall damping phenomenon and stability of tube under varying support plate thickness for both drag and lift direction the variation of damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number along with the support plate thickness and natural frequency is highlighted in fig 15 for drag direction as can be seen that the damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number tends to decrease with the increase in natural frequency and increases with the increase in the intermediate support plate thickness for drag direction it further shows that as the natural frequency for the each plate thickness increases the damping effect of the tube gradually decreases which eventually leads to the instability of the overall system the experimentation is performed for the three distinct support plate thickness which highlights the conclusive trend of increased system s stability with the increase in the intermediate support plate thickness the plate of 2 mm shows less stability whereas the plate of 3 6 mm shows the higher stability as indicated by the damping factors the maximum damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number are observed to be around 0 11 0 69 and 0 61 0 14 0 89 and 0 79 and 0 15 0 93 and 0 83 for the support plate thickness of 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm respectively the quantitative measures figured out that the support plate of thickness 3 6 mm with a natural frequency of 8 hz is suitable to attain higher stability and damping factor as the natural frequency increases or the support plate thickness decreases the stability of the system critically decreases the damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number along with plate thickness and natural frequency for the lift direction is shown in fig 16 same trend for the lift direction is observed as that of drag direction but with a higher overall damping value the damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number decreases with the increase in natural frequency for every particular plate thickness whereas increases with the increase in support plate thickness lower the natural frequency of the tube higher will be the damping ratio of the system the maximum observed value of damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number are 0 12 0 77 and 0 69 0 19 1 21 and 1 08 and 0 2 1 24 and 1 11 for the support plate thickness of 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm respectively moreover it is noted that the analyzed damping effects for the lift direction is higher than that of drag direction furthermore less amount of energy is dissipated for every sequential increase in the value of natural frequency and hence less damping effects are produced the behavior of the damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number indorses that the support plate of thickness of 3 6 mm is favorable to produce highly damped and low vibrating system finally the percentage increase in the damping ratio upon successive decrease in natural frequency for both drag and lift direction under three support plate thickness i e 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm is highlighted in fig 17 the presented data gives a better overall understanding and quantitative measures for the ultimate trend of damping ratio of the tube subjected to the interaction of the flowing fluid it can be seen that the percentage increase for the change in natural frequency from 9 to 8 is high for all support plate thicknesses for drag as well as lift direction which eventually decreases upon sequential decrease in natural frequency the trend further highlights that as the natural frequency of the tube decreases the value of percentage increase for the damping ratio decreases therefore the presented vibrational analysis is performed at a fixed natural frequency i e 8 hz because it gives a higher overall percentage increase in damping ratio however the damping ratio always increases upon the decrease in the natural frequency as observed earlier but the successive difference in the value of damping ratio for the two subsequent natural frequencies in terms of percentage increase goes on decreasing for each support plate thickness moreover it is also important to highlight that the percentage increase is maximum at the support plate thickness of 2 8 mm when the natural frequency changes from 9 to 8 hz however with further increase in the support plate thickness i e 3 6 mm the percentage increase in damping ratio decreases but on the other side the vibrational amplitude at 3 6 mm support plate is considerably low as discussed earlier therefore the natural frequency of 8 hz at an intermediate support plate thickness of 3 6 mm is suggested for the current system from the above analysis it is clear that the system is more damped in terms of damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number if the natural frequency of the system is kept low however the amplitude of vibration increases with the decrease in natural frequency of the system ji et al 2016 08 lin and yu 2005 so a system for smaller vibrations can be designed by setting a high value of the natural frequency but at the same time damping effect of the system decreases on the other hand a high damping ratio impacts the system to vibrate with high amplitude of vibration furthermore the intermediate support plate thickness plays a vital role while selecting a natural frequency with a higher overall damping ratio of a system as employed in this study therefore the system with the natural frequency of 8 hz at support plate thickness of 3 6 mm is suggested to be the best solution for the current system while designing a highly damped system for relatively low amplitude of vibrations 5 conclusion the current analysis is carried out to study the stability of central tube of tube bundle in terms of vibration response and damping factors under the influence of flow induced vibrations the damping factors for central tube of each tube bundle are assessed at natural frequencies of 9 8 7 and 6 hz moreover the vibration response of central tube is further analyzed in terms of rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude at fixed natural frequency of 8 hz the extensive experimental analysis is performed to figure out that which configuration of tube bundle is more suitable in terms of damping and vibration response to achieve stability condition some key conclusions can be drawn as follows the rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude of the central tube tends to decrease with the increase in intermediate support plate thickness for both drag and lift direction further both the factors are observed relatively high for lift as compared to drag highlighting that large instabilities are associated with transverse flow direction lift at all support plate of thickness i e 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm the damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number tends to increase with increase in intermediate support plate thickness whereas decreases with the increase in natural frequency of the monitored tube for both drag and lift direction the percentage increase pi in damping ratio highlights that large energy dissipation occurs when the natural frequency of the tube decreases from 9 to 8 hz for each support plate thickness however further decrease in natural frequency results in minor percentage increase in damping ratio therefore the natural frequency of 8 hz along with support plate thickness of 3 6 mm is suggested for higher overall stability credit authorship contribution statement muhammad shahid

21532,vibration response and damping effects on flexible aluminum tube placed in tube bundle under fluid interaction velocity of 0 5 m s using water tunnel is analyzed experimentally for drag and lift direction the study is undertaken to reduce the flow induced instabilities in heat exchanger proposing low vibrating design approach therefore three tube bundles in triangular arrangement using distinct support plate thickness of 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm under p d ratio of 1 45 are developed respectively the vibrations are sensed through tri axial accelerometer mounted at top of central tube the damping factors are assessed for monitored central tube of each tube bundle at tuned natural frequencies of 9 8 7 and 6 hz respectively whereas tube vibration response is further analyzed in terms of rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude at fixed natural frequency of 8 hz the results highlight that the damping factors under all four natural frequencies exhibit increasing and the tube vibrations show decreasing trend with increase in support plate thickness respectively moreover successive decrease in natural frequency of tube 9 6 hz influence the damping factors to increase for each tube bundle based on assessment it is noted that tube bundle comprising 3 6 mm thick support plate along 8 hz natural frequency shows maximum stability for given setup keywords water tunnel flow

heat exchangers are extensively utilized in oil and gas industry yang et al 2020 as well as nuclear sector due to their simple structure and multi purpose application under a wide range of working pressure naqvi et al 2019 the fluid interaction forces and flow velocity which are directly related to reynolds number and strouhal number are considered one of most critical aspect for the vibrations point of view goyder 2002a further the tube motion indicates intermittent to chaotic behavior with the increase in the flow pitch velocity lai et al 2020 that eventually leads to the short life span and damage of the heat exchanger quan et al 2019 beside this the flow induced vibrations play a positive role to increase the heat transfer rate duan et al 2016 2020 by increasing the fluid turbulence and reducing the temperature layer around the tubes of the shell and tube heat exchanger su et al 2016 2019 however this phenomenon is limited to the fact that if the flow induced vibrations increase up to a critical level large energy will be transferred which will lead to the high amplitude of acceleration in tube wang et al 2019 the large acceleration further generates instability in heat exchanger in both shell and tube side khushnood and nizam 2017 like severe tube leakage problem weaver et al 1988 collision damage and eventually the damage of entire tube bundle weaver and fitzpatrick 1988 khushnood et al 2012 therefore the vibration analysis under the interaction of tube and flowing fluid are believed to be more significant in comparison with the heat transfer applications pettigrew and taylor 2003a few researchers have presented their study to reduce the flow induced vibrations with enhanced heat transfer through different configurations and design approach as large amplitude of vibrations are not accepted in industrial sector in any case since it can lead to the brutal damage of the equipment goyder 2002b and further widen the path towards the sudden unplanned shutdown of the plant which is practically undesirable for instance a novel anti vibrating hexagonal clamping baffle plate is analyzed through cfd analysis under the influence of velocity baffle distance and profile for the heat transfer enhancement of shell and tube heat exchanger yu et al 2018 moreover in another study the motion of the tubes are investigated under different tube configurations for distinct p d ratio at variable flow velocities in cross flow direction of the fully immersed tubes wang et al 2019 furthermore in a simulation study the flow induced vibrations are studied in terms of vibration amplitude and frequency in cross flow direction and validated under three different flow velocities brockmeyer et al 2019 12 in another simulation study the impact of unsteady fluid forces are investigated on the tube bundle through forced vibration method in a triangular tube bundle geometry with a pitch ratio of 1 32 the study highlights that the lift force is mainly caused by the amplitude of the tube itself and is less effected by the degree of freedom in rotation and vibration direction chen et al 2020 likewise the vibrational displacement and frequency spectra of the first row of the tubes were investigated experimentally through the support plate and anti vibration bars quan et al 2019 moreover the vibrational amplitude and heat transfer effects were studied through a configuration of anti vibrational baffle plate under flow conditions for parallel flow shell and tube heat exchangers yu et al 2019 04 furthermore a simulation analysis is performed to increase and decrease the heat transfer rate and flow induced vibrations respectively through different design and configuration of baffle plates naqvi et al 2019 another study based on the heat transfer enhancement and vibration response of flexible tube of heat exchanger is investigated numerically ji et al 2016 08 while applying dynamic parameters through different tube size tube mass and flowing fluid the added mass is one of the unavoidable aspect in flow induced vibrations that varies the overall natural frequency and mode shapes of the system weaver 1993 moretti and lowery 1976 similarly lower diameter of channel reduces the vortex induced vibration that eventually increases the lift force in the vibrating tube zang and gao 2014 it is studied further that both the amplitude of vibration and pitch to diameter ratio drastically impact the lift coefficient pettigrew and taylor 2003b blevins and vibration 1990 moreover an experimental and numerical study on fluid elastic instability highlights that the time delay factor considerably depends on the critical velocity at generally low the void fraction lai et al 2020 03 lai et al 2020 09 the above studies fairly indicate the importance of the analysis of flow induced vibration therefore the current study is undertaken to experimentally analyze the vibration response and damping effects on the flexible aluminum tube under three distinct tube bundles comprised of intermediate support plates of thickness i e 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm respectively the damping analysis is investigated for the central tube of three tube bundles having distinct support plates under varying natural frequency of 9 8 7 and 6 hz respectively whereas the vibration response analysis is further performed at a fixed natural frequency of 8 hz through a novel approach by using closed loop water tunnel which is not previously reported however there exist some studies based on the analysis through vibration exciters using different tube material geometry and flow pattern under controlled conditions whereas in this study the extensive vibration and damping behavior of aluminum tube in a triangular pattern under fully flooded fluid interaction in cross flow pattern is performed the research further highlights the overall comparison of damping factors through three different intermediate support plates under four different natural frequencies leading to the conclusive trend that which arrangement is favorable for increasing the damping effects to control the vibrating phenomena for system stability therefore the current investigation can be considered as a significant contribution in the research for the efficient design of shell and tube heat exchanger 2 fluid elastic models to significantly investigate the impact of flow induced vibrations on interacting tube bundle several fluid elastic instability models have been proposed by the researchers for instance a model was proposed to explain the motion of cylindrical tube in the flowing fluid by using laplace s equation given as rao and yap 2011 1 d 2 x d τ 2 2 ζ d x d τ x ρ u 2 2 m ω n 2 0 717 1 c b p x τ 2 ω n d u 1 c b p m e a n d k d x where m d τ and cbp are mass outer diameter of tube non dimensional time and base pressure coefficient respectively a more simple and elementary stable model was proposed by applying energy balance for inline flow and transverse flow direction given as connors 1970 2 u f d k 2 π ξ m ρ d 2 0 5 here k indicates a constant its value was evaluated through distinct techniques the stability criteria was further modified to evaluate the value of k for both fluid damping controlled instability and fluid elastic stiffness controlled instability given as chen 1983a 3 u f v d 4 c g v 2 π ξ v m v ρ d 2 4 u f w d 4 c g w 2 π ξ w m w ρ d 2 equations 3 and 4 represents the stability model of the fluid damping controlled instability for both in vacuum and in still fluid respectively similarly the stability models for the fluid elastic stiffness controlled instability are represented by equations 5 and 6 given as 5 u f v d 2 π c f v 2 π ξ v m v ρ d 2 0 5 6 u f w d 2 π c f w 2 π ξ w m w ρ d 2 0 5 moreover equations 3 6 can be summarized in a combined function form as equation 7 7 u f v d f 2 π ξ v m v ρ d 2 m v ρ d 2 t d p n d t u r b u l e n c e c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s furthermore in another study the fluid damping controlled instability and fluid elastic stiffness controlled instability mechanism are further highlighted chen 1983b the friction between the support plate and vibrating tube yields greater damping at relatively low vibration amplitude a simple and applicable damping model related to the support plate thickness t span length l and number of spans n is developed given as pettigrew and taylor 2003c 8 ζ 5 n 1 n t l 0 5 3 the system description 3 1 experimental setup the vibration response and damping analysis is carried out through the closed loop low speed water tunnel with a fully flooded flow at a velocity of 0 5 m s the complete system consists of five main parts i e low speed water tunnel aluminum test tube bundle 10 hp motor with centrifugal pump water storage tank and tri axial accelerometer the schematic diagram of the experimental process loop with main components is illustrated in fig 1 the complete process of the system is defined as follow the water is extracted from the water tank through the suction line and accelerated with the help of a centrifugal pump coupled with 10 hp electric motor the water is then supplied ahead in the divergent section of the water tunnel through a pump delivery line here the pressure of the water is increased by decreasing the velocity of the fluid a flow straightener section is positioned among the metallic divergent and convergent section comprised of the honeycomb structure to keep the flow inline and uniform with a maximum turbulence intensity of 3 the convergent section is used to provide fully flooded uniform flow of water with a velocity of 0 5 m s two throttling globe valves are used in the delivery and recirculation line to control the inlet and outlet water flow rate in the test section of water tunnel the test section is made up of acrylic plates of 0 5 mm thickness for the vibrational analysis of central tube placed in a tube bundle here the flowing fluid interacts with the flexible test tube bundle which allows the tube to vibrate by the transmission of fluid force in both drag inline flow and lift transverse flow direction after interacting with the flexible tube bundle the water is returned in the storage tank through a recirculation line for cyclic closed loop operation the physical experimental setup of the water tunnel with the tube bundle for vibration and damping analysis is presented in fig 2 the pump suction inlet is coupled with the water storage tank though suction line whereas the delivery line of the pump is coupled with the inlet of the divergent section of the water tunnel the divergent section is used at the inlet of the water tunnel to increase the pressure and decrease the velocity of the flowing fluid as the study is undertaken on a relatively low water speed i e 0 5 m s a flow straightener comprised of honeycomb structure is employed in the water tunnel to produce the smooth inline flow stream moreover the inlet of the test section is coupled with the convergent section to attain fully flooded fluid flow the test section of water tunnel is used for the vibration and damping analysis of aluminum test tube bundle with a dimension of 200 mm 100 mm the tube generated vibration signals are sensed through the accelerometer placed at the top of the test tube labeled as 1 in fig 2 moreover the close loop of fluid in the water tunnel is attained by incorporating a recirculation line at the end of test section through which the water is collected again in the storage tank for the sake of reuse moreover the specifications of the experimental apparatus low speed closed loop water tunnel are given in table 1 the physical setup and linkage mechanism of aluminum test tube bundle along with the position of support plate and accelerometer is represented in fig 3 the presented flexible aluminum test tube bundle with the intermediate support plate is used for the vibration and damping analysis moreover the support plate is placed in the middle of the tube bundle the aluminum tubes are placed in a parallel tri angular arrangement in tube bundle with a fixed pitch to diameter p d ratio of 1 45 whereas the wall thickness of 0 9 mm is used for all the tubes in entire experimentation for the linkage of whole tube bundle assembly two acrylic plates are placed at the top and bottom of the tubes in the form of pair for rigid supporting with the help of supporting studs whereas the central test tube is passed throughout the upper acrylic sheet in order to sense the vibrations through accelerometer where it is supported by the tensioning nut as can be seen in fig 3 a b moreover the central monitored tube is grabbed from the bottom of the assembly by passing a piano wire through a pin hole in the tube above 1 5 mm from the bottom of tube bundle further the piano wire is tightened at the bottom through a nut and a washer labeled as 9 in fig 3 c additionally a closed view of the top and bottom of the tube bundle is presented in fig 3 b c respectively furthermore another acrylic sheet is placed at the top of the supporting studs to aid the tensioning mechanism for the adjustment of natural frequency of the central tube for this purpose a tensioning nut is installed at the top of the tube bundle labeled as 1 in fig 3 for tuning the desired natural frequency of the tube at 6 hz 7 hz 8 hz and 9 hz the tensioning nut is tightened or loosened which eventually exerts a force on the central tube with the aid of 0 2 mm thick piano wire for the determination of the tuned natural frequency the central tube is firstly set to the free vibrations after placing the tube bundle into the test section of the water tunnel and the tube generated vibrations are captured through the tri axial accelerometer these signals are further transferred to the laptop installed with node commander where they are decoded through sig view software to obtain the actual value of tuned natural frequency to analyze the vibration response of the central monitored tube for three distinct tube bundles comprised of support plates of 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm the central tube is tuned to 8 hz natural frequency however for the implementation of tuned natural frequency in the experiment the tube bundle is placed in the test section of the water tunnel where the central tube is vibrated through the interaction of flowing fluid at a velocity of 0 5 m s as shown in fig 2 whereas the generated vibrations are sensed through tri axial accelerometer for both drag and lift direction further for the implementation of the four natural frequencies i e 9 8 7 and 6 hz to evaluate damping factors the half bandwidth method is adopted for each tube bundle with support plate thickness of 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm respectively moreover the half bandwidth method is elaborated through fig 12 and equation 11 is used to calculate the damping ratio a top view of the tube bundle is presented in fig 4 it can be seen that the tubes are arranged in a triangular arrangement in which the highlighted tube represents the central monitored test tube the central test tube is mounted with wireless tri axial accelerometer to monitor the vibration response in both y and x direction which indicates the inline flow drag and the transverse flow lift direction respectively the design and geometry of the intermediate support plate is represented in fig 5 the experimentation is carried out separately through three different intermediate support plates in terms of their thickness i e 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm that are shown in fig 5 a b and c respectively the outer dimension of the support plate is kept constant for all the three intermediate support plates as 85 mm 85 mm it is important to highlight that the inner diameter of the central hole of the intermediate support plate is 13 2 mm whereas the inner diameter of all the remaining holes are kept at 12 7 mm the central hole of the support plate is designed i e 13 2 mm in such a manner to provide a clearance of 0 5 mm between the central tube outer diameter and the support plate hole inner diameter for the significant development of squeeze film besides this the remaining holes are kept purposely at 12 7 mm in diameter to provide transition fit in between the support plate holes and tubes of the bundle to grab the intermediate support plate at a fixed position moreover the specifications of the test tube bundle and intermediate support plate are listed in table 2 3 2 measurement procedure of experimentation in the present research work three triangular arrangement tube bundles having distinct intermediated support plates with a pitch to diameter ratio p d of 1 45 is used to examine the vibration response and damping effects by the interaction of the flowing fluid the central tube of the bundle is analyzed through g link tri axial accelerometer placed at the top of the test tube due to the fact that the central tube experience a large amplitude of vibrations with maximum flow irregularities the monitored tube is made flexible for the desired natural frequency with an uncertainty of 0 1 hz by tensioning the 0 2 mm thick piano wire in a special arrangement as shown in fig 3 whereas the three support plates of the thickness 2 2 8 and 3 6 mm are designed separately for the analysis the vibration signals are captured and transmitted through the accelerometer to the wsda base station connected with the laptop computer installed with node commander these signals are then decoded by the sig view software to analyze the obtained results a data acquisition loop of the system is represented in fig 6 the current research work is comprised of two pivotal analysis i e vibration response analysis and damping analysis for the three distinct triangular aluminum tube bundles using low speed water tunnel for both drag inline flow direction and lift transverse flow direction for vibration response analysis the dataset is recorded for 18 distinct period of times for every 30 min interval up to a maximum duration of 3 h for both drag inline flow and lift transverse flow directions these datasets are obtained at fixed natural frequency of 8 hz for the monitored test tube under three intermediate support plate thickness as the tube bundle interacts with the flowing fluid distinct patterns of vibration response are generated according to the tuned natural frequency i e 8 hz subjected to different intermediate support plate thickness used in the tube bundle moreover the extensive damping analysis in terms of damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number is further performed for 12 different setups of test tube bundles comprised of the three distinct intermediate support plate thickness i e 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm under four natural frequencies of the monitored tube at 9 8 7 and 6 hz respectively it is important to highlight that the said natural frequencies are associated with the central monitored aluminum tube of tube bundle labeled as 7 as shown in fig 3 a whereas the natural frequency of monitored tube for each setup is determined through accelerometer by setting the tube free vibrations as described in detail earlier finally the obtained results of the vibration response and damping factors for drag and lift are analyzed to conclude the overall behavior of the monitored aluminum tube 4 results and discussion 4 1 vibration response analysis moving fluid while going through the flexible tube centrally positioned in the tube bundle exerts force depending upon the flow speed and intermediate support plate thickness which allows the tube to displace from its original position the exerted force is responsible for the tube vibration in both drag inline flow and lift transverse flow direction the vibration effects are presented in the form of both vibration response and damping effects in the tube in the first step the signal acceleration behavior for the three tube bundles having distinct intermediate support plate thicknesses i e 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm is presented these signals are represented for the time interval of 10 s at a fixed natural frequency of 8 0 1 hz for each case fig 7 represents the oscillation motion of the tube in both drag inline flow direction and lift transverse flow direction under the influence of flowing fluid for the support plate thickness of 2 mm it can be seen that the tube accelerates with large amplitude in lift direction as compare to the drag direction the maximum observed variation in the acceleration is around 1 6 m s2 and 2 5 m s2 for drag and lift respectively moreover the variation is somewhat irregular in both cases when the support plate thickness is kept low at 2 mm moreover it is important to highlight that the tube begins to decelerate as the thickness of the intermediate support plate increases this is due to the fact that with the increase in the thickness of the intermediate support plate the area of the squeeze film between the outer surface of the tube and inner surface of the support plate increases which ultimately increase and decrease the damping ratio and vibrational acceleration respectively fig 8 represents the acceleration signal behavior of the central tube of bundle in case of 2 8 mm intermediate support plate thickness it can be observed that the signal accelerates between 1 m s2 and 2 m s2 for drag and lift respectively the variation of the acceleration signal is significantly low for 2 8 mm as compared to 2 mm support plate thickness which shows that the tube is vibrating for a lower amplitude as compared to the plate thickness of 2 mm thus approaching to a more stable condition upon the increase in the intermediate support plate thickness fig 9 further highlights the acceleration behavior of the signal in case of tube bundle with 3 6 mm intermediate support plate thickness as observed earlier the system follows the same trend of decreasing acceleration as compared to both the previous cases i e for spt 2 mm and spt 2 8 mm the maximum observed values for the acceleration in case of drag and lift are around 0 9 m s2 and 1 8 m s2 respectively the resulted signal trend highlights that the system experience a more stable condition in case of support plate thickness of 3 6 mm due to the further increase in the area of squeeze film between the tube and support plate it is much important to highlight that there is a limitation for the thickness of the intermediate support plate due to the fact that increasing the thickness of the plate will also increase the mass of the system which ultimately lead to the further irreversibility in the system therefore in this case the maximum thickness of 3 6 mm is suggested to overcome the vibrational issues of the tube bundle operated under fully flooded fluid flow with the velocity of 0 5 m s the tube response is further explained by its rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude the rms acceleration value is of much importance in sinusoidal wave form representation in vibration analysis moreover the dimensionless magnitude is calculated through the following relation given as 9 ψ a y d here a y is the amplitude of vibrations in m which is further evaluated for the calculation of dimensionless magnitude through the following relationship given as khalifa et al 2012 10 10 a y α r m s 4 π 2 f n 2 for the determination of rms acceleration m s2 the tube bundle is placed in the test section of the water tunnel along with the accelerometer fixed at the top of the central tube of the bundle in a vertical direction as shown in fig 2 under fluid interaction with the tube bundle the generated vibrations of the central aluminum tube are captured by the accelerometer which transmit wireless signals to the base station the signals are then further transferred to the laptop installed with node commander where they are decoded using sig view software the rms value of acceleration for each tube bundle setup is obtained respectively this rms value is then used to calculate the amplitude of the tube using equation 10 the rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude for drag inline flow direction is represented in fig 10 for the three distinct intermediate support plate thickness the data is recorded at every 30 min interval for a maximum duration of 180 min for each support plate thickness i e 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm it is important to highlight that both the rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude for drag follows a decreasing trend for every 30 min successive interval of time for the three intermediate support plate thickness this is due to the fact that the system develops a more smooth flow stream at maximum stability when operated for an extensive time period moreover the increase in the intermediate support plate thickness tends to decrease the rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude of the tube the support plate with smaller thickness i e 2 mm shows the largest rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude value and the support plate of thickness 3 6 mm shows the smallest rms acceleration value this is due to the fact that the squeeze film thickness between the tube and support plate increases with the increase in the support plate thickness which eventually increases the damping effect of the tube the minimum observed values of rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude are around 0 81 m s2 0 03 0 8 m s2 0 03 and 0 7 m s2 0 02 for the intermediate support plate thickness of 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm respectively this simply highlights that the tube vibrates with low amplitude for large value of intermediate support plate thickness both the rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude shows a decreasing trend when observed for every successive increase in the time span of experimentation i e from 30 min to 180 min the tube response is further explained in terms of rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude for the lift transverse flow direction as observed in fig 11 both the parameters for lift figures out almost the same accelerating trend as observed earlier for drag however it can be seen that greater intermediate support plate thickness considerably drops the rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude in lift direction as compared to the drag direction moreover both the rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude for lift direction is considerably large as compared to the drag direction the support plate with smaller thickness i e 2 mm shows the largest value and the support plate of thickness of 3 6 mm shows the smallest value for both rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude respectively the minimum observed value of rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude are around 1 97 m s2 0 06 1 75 m s2 0 05 and 1 74 m s2 0 05 for the intermediate support plate thickness of 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm respectively this indicate that the tube vibrates with low amplitude for large value of intermediate support plate thickness in lift direction as well both the rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude follows a decreasing trend with the passage of time and shows the highest values for the first 30 min for all the three support plate thicknesses i e 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm furthermore it is concluded that the observed rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude in drag direction is always smaller than that of lift direction the trend highlights that the tube displace with large amplitude in lift direction as compared to the drag direction moreover the above analysis shows that the tube stability is higher for the large support plate thickness i e spt 3 6 mm for both the drag and lift direction it is also observed that the tube shows more instability in lift direction as compare to drag direction for each support plate thickness hence lift direction analysis is considered to be the utmost critical concern to remove instabilities 4 2 damping analysis the flowing fluid field changes by passing through the flexible triangular tube bundle geometry and exerts some force which is responsible for the vibration of the tube in a tube bundle the fluid force is controlled by the damping force of the tube bundle which stabilizes the tube bundle back to its initial position there will be no vibration if the damping force is greater than the fluid force the damping force is mainly dependent upon the material geometry and thickness of the tube and intermediate support plate beside all of the factors the intermediate support plate thickness is highlighted as a major damping element for the efficient control of the tube vibrations the tube bundle fairly experience a more stable condition in terms of vibrational amplitude with the increase in the tube support plate thickness kim et al 1989 the half bandwidth method is used to calculate the damping ratio for different time periods according to this method the damping ratio ζ can be calculated as iqbal 2010 11 ζ f 2 f 1 2 f n where f n natural frequency of the signals in hz at maximum amplitude of the signal x max f 1 frequency value in hz at x max 2 of 3 db down from peak value lower than f n f2 frequency value in hz at xmax 2 of 3 db down from peak value higher than fn the x max is the maximum amplitude of signals in db and x max 2 is the value of the amplitude below 3 db down from x max as represented in fig 12 the logarithmic curve shows how rapidly the amplitude of vibrations decay moreover the damping of structure will be high if the vibration decays more rapidly khushnood and nizam 2017 the damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number against the intermediate support plate thickness for drag is represented in fig 13 the data is represented for the fixed natural frequency of the tube at 8 hz for drag direction under three support plate thicknesses i e 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm it can be seen that the central monitored tube exhibits higher damping as intermediate support plate thickness increases thus increase in the intermediate support plate thickness tends to increase the stability of the tube bundle this is because of the increase in the squeeze film area which eventually forms a damping layer around the outer surface of tube the large squeeze film area dissipates more energy and decreases the vibrational amplitude which tend to increase the overall damping phenomenon the scruton number is another dimensionless damping parameter used to study the damping behavior of the tube subjected to the flow induced vibrations it is also termed as mass damping or reduced damping that is equal to the product of mass ratio and damping factor blevins 1977 moreover the scruton number shows the inverse relation with the amplitude of the vibration therefore larger the value of the scruton number of the tube smaller will be the amplitude of displacement and vice versa the scruton number is evaluated through the following relationship given as hansen 2007 12 s c 2 m 2 π ζ ρ d 2 the tube bundle damping analysis is further evaluated in terms of logarithmic decrement δ it is defined as the rate of energy dissipation of vibration in the tube and can be calculated from damping ratio chowdhury et al 2000 as follows 13 δ 2 π ζ 1 ζ 2 the above relation shows that the amplitude of vibration will decline rapidly under higher energy dissipation rate moreover for the damping ratio 1 the above relation can be expressed as 14 δ 2 π ζ fig 13 highlights that the maximum damping effect is produced through the support plate thickness of 3 6 mm due to the increases in the area of the squeeze film between the tube and support plate hole the maximum value of damping ratio ζ logarithmic decrement δ and scruton number sc are observed to be 0 12 0 73 and 0 65 for the plate thickness of 3 6 mm in the drag direction respectively whereas the minimum value of all the three factors are observed for the plate thickness of 2 mm it is also important to highlight that the maximum change for all the three factors is observed when the support plate thickness increases from 2 mm to 2 8 mm although the plate thickness of 3 6 mm exhibits the highest value for ζ δ and sc but the difference between the values are observed to be less when the plate thickness increases from 2 8 mm to 3 6 mm fig 14 shows the behavior of damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number along the three intermediate support plate thickness for lift direction it can be seen that the damping effect produced in the lift direction is slightly higher as compared to the drag direction the squeeze film impacts on both lift and drag to significantly increase the damping effects on the tube under fully flooded fluid flow of 0 5 m s the scruton number and logarithmic decrement are also higher in the lift direction as compared to the drag direction although the trend is much similar for this case also in which the maximum and minimum damping is also observed on 3 6 mm and 2 mm support plate thickness respectively the maximum value for damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number are observed to be around 0 14 0 9 and 0 8 for support plate thickness of 3 6 mm respectively which shows that the 3 6 mm support plate thickness shows higher damping effects and tends to stable the system for the natural frequency of 8 hz in lift direction also moreover the above analysis also highlights that the damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number have larger value for lift direction rather than drag direction which indicates that support plate thickness phenomena is more significant to reduce the instabilities in lift direction as compared to drag direction as the natural frequency is of prime concern to evaluate the response of the vibrating body of the system in terms of both the amplitude of vibration and the damping factor therefore the damping effects of the tube are further investigated using three distinct support plate thicknesses 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm under four different natural frequencies i e 9 hz 8 hz 7 hz and 6 hz respectively the analysis further enhance the visualization aspect to estimate the overall damping phenomenon and stability of tube under varying support plate thickness for both drag and lift direction the variation of damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number along with the support plate thickness and natural frequency is highlighted in fig 15 for drag direction as can be seen that the damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number tends to decrease with the increase in natural frequency and increases with the increase in the intermediate support plate thickness for drag direction it further shows that as the natural frequency for the each plate thickness increases the damping effect of the tube gradually decreases which eventually leads to the instability of the overall system the experimentation is performed for the three distinct support plate thickness which highlights the conclusive trend of increased system s stability with the increase in the intermediate support plate thickness the plate of 2 mm shows less stability whereas the plate of 3 6 mm shows the higher stability as indicated by the damping factors the maximum damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number are observed to be around 0 11 0 69 and 0 61 0 14 0 89 and 0 79 and 0 15 0 93 and 0 83 for the support plate thickness of 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm respectively the quantitative measures figured out that the support plate of thickness 3 6 mm with a natural frequency of 8 hz is suitable to attain higher stability and damping factor as the natural frequency increases or the support plate thickness decreases the stability of the system critically decreases the damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number along with plate thickness and natural frequency for the lift direction is shown in fig 16 same trend for the lift direction is observed as that of drag direction but with a higher overall damping value the damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number decreases with the increase in natural frequency for every particular plate thickness whereas increases with the increase in support plate thickness lower the natural frequency of the tube higher will be the damping ratio of the system the maximum observed value of damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number are 0 12 0 77 and 0 69 0 19 1 21 and 1 08 and 0 2 1 24 and 1 11 for the support plate thickness of 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm respectively moreover it is noted that the analyzed damping effects for the lift direction is higher than that of drag direction furthermore less amount of energy is dissipated for every sequential increase in the value of natural frequency and hence less damping effects are produced the behavior of the damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number indorses that the support plate of thickness of 3 6 mm is favorable to produce highly damped and low vibrating system finally the percentage increase in the damping ratio upon successive decrease in natural frequency for both drag and lift direction under three support plate thickness i e 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm is highlighted in fig 17 the presented data gives a better overall understanding and quantitative measures for the ultimate trend of damping ratio of the tube subjected to the interaction of the flowing fluid it can be seen that the percentage increase for the change in natural frequency from 9 to 8 is high for all support plate thicknesses for drag as well as lift direction which eventually decreases upon sequential decrease in natural frequency the trend further highlights that as the natural frequency of the tube decreases the value of percentage increase for the damping ratio decreases therefore the presented vibrational analysis is performed at a fixed natural frequency i e 8 hz because it gives a higher overall percentage increase in damping ratio however the damping ratio always increases upon the decrease in the natural frequency as observed earlier but the successive difference in the value of damping ratio for the two subsequent natural frequencies in terms of percentage increase goes on decreasing for each support plate thickness moreover it is also important to highlight that the percentage increase is maximum at the support plate thickness of 2 8 mm when the natural frequency changes from 9 to 8 hz however with further increase in the support plate thickness i e 3 6 mm the percentage increase in damping ratio decreases but on the other side the vibrational amplitude at 3 6 mm support plate is considerably low as discussed earlier therefore the natural frequency of 8 hz at an intermediate support plate thickness of 3 6 mm is suggested for the current system from the above analysis it is clear that the system is more damped in terms of damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number if the natural frequency of the system is kept low however the amplitude of vibration increases with the decrease in natural frequency of the system ji et al 2016 08 lin and yu 2005 so a system for smaller vibrations can be designed by setting a high value of the natural frequency but at the same time damping effect of the system decreases on the other hand a high damping ratio impacts the system to vibrate with high amplitude of vibration furthermore the intermediate support plate thickness plays a vital role while selecting a natural frequency with a higher overall damping ratio of a system as employed in this study therefore the system with the natural frequency of 8 hz at support plate thickness of 3 6 mm is suggested to be the best solution for the current system while designing a highly damped system for relatively low amplitude of vibrations 5 conclusion the current analysis is carried out to study the stability of central tube of tube bundle in terms of vibration response and damping factors under the influence of flow induced vibrations the damping factors for central tube of each tube bundle are assessed at natural frequencies of 9 8 7 and 6 hz moreover the vibration response of central tube is further analyzed in terms of rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude at fixed natural frequency of 8 hz the extensive experimental analysis is performed to figure out that which configuration of tube bundle is more suitable in terms of damping and vibration response to achieve stability condition some key conclusions can be drawn as follows the rms acceleration and dimensionless magnitude of the central tube tends to decrease with the increase in intermediate support plate thickness for both drag and lift direction further both the factors are observed relatively high for lift as compared to drag highlighting that large instabilities are associated with transverse flow direction lift at all support plate of thickness i e 2 mm 2 8 mm and 3 6 mm the damping ratio logarithmic decrement and scruton number tends to increase with increase in intermediate support plate thickness whereas decreases with the increase in natural frequency of the monitored tube for both drag and lift direction the percentage increase pi in damping ratio highlights that large energy dissipation occurs when the natural frequency of the tube decreases from 9 to 8 hz for each support plate thickness however further decrease in natural frequency results in minor percentage increase in damping ratio therefore the natural frequency of 8 hz along with support plate thickness of 3 6 mm is suggested for higher overall stability credit authorship contribution statement muhammad shahid

21533,the concept of modular floating structures mfs offers a unique avenue to explore new and sustainable ways for addressing issues of coastal urbanization and sea level rise in the proximity of coastal cities this concept is easily implemented in calm waters without the interference of waves yet its implementation in open water poses greater challenges particularly in terms of habitability and comfort the current study examines the feasibility of the concept in two locations in mild sea zone near singapore and in open water conditions at the eastern mediterranean sea both conditions are examined in operational and extreme storms it is shown that the mfs configuration can attenuate incident waves of short periods this reduces the motion amplitudes of the inner modules with respect to the exterior modules facing the waves it is also presented that during extreme storms the chosen configuration is less effective and the motion amplitudes of all modules within the mfs fabric are almost identical to further increase the acceptable sea states the study proposes a unique floating seawall design which provides a substantial wave reduction in long wave periods the study presents the efficiency of the new configuration in operational weather and a 100 years storm keywords coastal expansion artificial islands modular floating structures hydrodynamic interaction floating breakwaters 1 introduction by 2050 it is estimated that 50 of the global population will live in coastal cities at the frontline of climate change events rosenzweig et al 2010 strain et al 2019 the most prominent of these events being global mean sea level rise slr climbing at an accelerating rate slr continues to baffle scientists that aim to predict its long term projections the challenge in achieving such forecasts is due in most part to the uncertainty regarding the potential contributions of ice sheets greenland and antarctica in 2013 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc published the comprehensive fifth assessment report ar5 conveying that the total slr will increase in up to ca 1 0 m by 2100 church et al 2013 however a recent study claims that slr will exceed 2 0 m by 2100 more than twice the value put forward by the ipcc just six years earlier bamber et al 2019 for many of the low lying communities it means that the threat is closer and much more grave than previously anticipated furthermore to date 2 4 billion people live in coastal communities 40 of the global population and the demand for urban space is on the rise as a result of demographic and urbanization processes sengupta et al 2018 united nations 2017 in order to overcome these problems the proposed study offers an alternative way to increase the available land resources to the adjacent marine environment of coastal cities by modular floating structures mfs the hypothesis is that mfs offers a unique new and sustainable solution for addressing issues related to coastal urbanization and global sea level rise in addition mfs has the potential to decrease the pressure on greenfield development key in reducing atmospheric co2 answers the demand for real estate closer to urban centers while making use of existing infrastructures e g power plants airports etc the traditional approach for expansion to the marine environment is through land reclamation a destructive and wasteful method that is considered obsolete in many developed countries duan et al 2016 peduzzi 2014 in recent years the concept of very large floating structures vlfs was proclaimed as a more sustainable solution for land reclamation andrianov 2006 drimer and gafter 2017 fujikubo 2005 kashiwagi 2000 ohmatsu 2005 wang et al 2007 but thus far has yet to fulfill its promise this is mainly as a result of production complexity detrimental environmental effects such as the local light climate and its consequences on the ecosystem and high production costs furthermore mega floats are usually designed to serve a single purpose e g airport storage facility etc and are not considered a viable alternative for residential development lamas pardo et al 2015 the mfs concept has the potential to solve all these deficiencies by using medium size relative to operated ship sizes rigid modules that create a large scale consolidated platform for urban development these floating modules or building units can be designed ad hoc for any urban purpose e g residential recreational facilities parks etc and can be arranged and rearranged in numerous spatial configurations this facilitates future growth and development as it can be realized by simply adding new modules in correlation to actual demand the concept of a floating city has been mentioned in the open literature more than 100 years ago french author jules verne 1828 1905 wrote the novels floating city and the floating islands in 1871 and 1895 respectively in more recent years the concept of a floating city composed of modular structures has been rehashed in the conceptual world of architects and town planners some notable examples can be found in the following references burt 2013 czapiewska et al 2013 ingels 2019 olthuis and keuning 2010 to mention only a few however thus far none of these utopian plans have yet to evolve into a complete realization of the program that said offshore technologies have made a great leap forward in recent years in both applications and scientific contributions e g downie et al 2000 hirdaris et al 2014 but these developments are almost exclusively tailored to the needs of the energy industry fossil and renewable to date there is no compliance between the utopian architectural plans and factual offshore engineering fig 1 demonstrates the conceptual gap between architectural proposals fig 1 a c and actual offshore projects from recent years fig 1 d f it is clear that typical offshore structures are too industrial and robust for normative urban applications and perhaps even too expensive therefore in order to bring the urban mfs concept into realization there is a need to narrow the gap between currently available engineering solutions technology and architectural design concept the proposed mfs concept aims to narrow this gap by providing engineering solutions and design methodologies suitable for urban needs offshore the main unit of analysis in this research explores the hydrodynamic responses of the mfs by implementing a multi body configuration to reduce motion amplitudes influencing occupant comfort habitability requirements expected in residential buildings such as occupant comfort criteria adds unique challenges to the design of offshore structures and play a significant role in its feasibility the use of onshore residential regulations for occupant comfort criteria is not widely discussed in the literature however this is one of the main criteria to define the performance limit of the mfs and it must be considered as a primary constraint in the design process in wang et al 2020 it was demonstrated that a single module with compliant mooring reaches a performance limit at a certain sea state this limit relates to the acceptable motions allowed in residential buildings the current study examines whether the allowable significant wave height could be increased by the global responses of the multi body configuration as such this study focuses on the service limit state design of offshore structure for urban use proof of feasibility of mfs from the structural and technological points of view using a multi disciplinary research approach was presented in wang et al 2018 2019 these studies included relevant aspects from the disciplines of naval architecture marine engineering civil engineering and architecture and town planning to solve the hydrodynamics of the proposed concept the analysis system ansys aqwa was used since the aim of the current presented research is to provide a proof of concept it was crucial to use a known and validated numerical tools mendonça ana et al 2012 pérez arribas and lópez piñeiro 2007 ren et al 2019 obviously in order to further capture local phenomena associated to nonlinear structural response or internal forces at the connections of adjacent modules further analysis is required which is beyond the scope of the current study and is considered for future research the study also examines extreme weather events where the use of breakwaters can be crucial conventional breakwaters such as rubble mound caissons or the combination the two composite breakwaters can provide the required wave protection needed for the feasibility of mfs but they pose similar environmental issues to land reclamation they change the natural near shore current destroy coastal sand balance and ecological systems liang et al 2004 in addition to their environmental shortcomings conventional breakwaters are technologically limited where water depth plays a critical role at water deeper than 30 m conventional breakwaters become unrealistic from a financial perspective tutuarima and d angremond 1998 a sustainable alternative to conventional breakwaters is floating breakwaters which allow the transport of water and sand and are not restricted by water depth considering the two alternatives in the context of sea level rise it is obvious that floating breakwaters are preferable because of their ability to adapt naturally to new conditions instead of conventional breakwaters that require continual vertical extension to this end this study examines the efficiency of the conversion of a decommissioned ultra large crude carrier ulcc into a floating breakwater in addition to wave attenuation the reuse of decommissioned ocean going ships helps to mitigate labor and environmental health issues associated with shipbreaking particularly in pakistan india bangladesh and china the main demolition markets of the world demaria 2010 neşer et al 2008 rahman et al 2019 yılmaz et al 2016 moreover it endorses a circular economy approach that reduces resource waste construction time and costs linked with the fabrication of new breakwaters in order to characterize the global dynamic response of the mfs the analysis focuses on a frequency domain to explore the range of wave periods prior to a spectral analysis in time domain for a given significant wave height the hydrodynamic interaction of the chosen 15 modules in the calculated environment is accounted for in the potential function solution the allowable motions in the calculated system adhere primarily to acceleration as a function of the frequencies acceptable in residential buildings iso 6897 1984 it is correlated to tall buildings that are susceptible to wind loads lamb et al 2016 the seakeeping based motion criteria accepted in the marine industry are generally less stringent and therefore may be used as a secondary input to determine the comfort level in relation to motion in the vertical direction only this is achieved by calculating the motion sickness doze value in z direction msdvz iso 2631 1997 the paper is divided into three main sections the first section outlines the methodology and the design procedure for single module and a multi body mfs configuration the next section explores the performance of the mfs in extreme weather for both sheltered and open water conditions which includes the seawall performance the third section investigates the performance of the mfs in operational weather conditions based on long term annual wave statistics the study ends with a summary and conclusions 2 design and methodology for mfs this section outlines the design methodology used in this study both the module and the mfs system are introduced a theoretical background of wave and structure interaction is also concisely discussed together with an explanation of the equation of motion and the response amplitude operator rao hydrodynamic analysis is performed with ansys aqwa that calculates the linear response of the mfs bodies in regular waves mathworks matlab is used for creating the module geometry the boundary elements model and the required input data for ansys aqwa run files in dat format mathworks matlab is also used for post processing which includes data analysis retrieving the relevant data from ansys aqwa output files in lis format and calculating the response amplitude in irregular waves this analysis platform was validated in a previous study for a single module wang et al 2020 in addition to other studies such as drimer and gafter 2017 and the studies by nallayarasu and kumar 2017 rahmdel et al 2016 that have shown good agreement between ansys aqwa and experimental results 2 1 the mfs layout a schematic arrangement of an arbitrary mfs system is presented in fig 2 and is considered in the current study the asymmetry of the layout is intentional as it allows for potential marine traffic to move within the mfs in addition the modules location in the mfs grid could be revised to optimize its performance and to reduce local wave resonance the major openings are currently shown in the leeward side of the schematic mfs in the current study the hydrodynamic analysis represents only the northwest quarter of the mfs layout composed of 15 modules the module type is chosen as module9000 was developed in an earlier study wang et al 2019 and is briefly described in section 2 2 the results throughout this paper are primarily given with respect to three representative modules in line with the waves direction shown in fig 2 as modules 1 10 and 15 the primary wave direction is from 45 to the longitudinal axis of the modules which is an optimal angle of attack for module9000 in terms of minimal motions amplitudes wang et al 2020 since the mfs modules are based on ship manufacturing sizes and maritime standards they can be fabricated at almost any commercial shipyard and as such obviates the need for modifying or creating new facilities in the typical module design module9000 the substructure hull length over all is 100 m and the maximal beam is 30 m this aspect significantly reduces the production costs since the module is within panamax size limits the compliance to marine regulation also dictates more stringent environmental regulations than the customary residential standards onshore marpol 2005 the analysis presented in the current study assumes that the modules are connected by ship to ship sts fenders acting as springs and not as dampers or dashpots and a compliant mooring system the distance between the adjacent modules is 4 5 m which is the diameter of a large off the shelf sts fender the function of the compliant mooring is to keep the modules in their position as schematically shown in fig 2 by resisting the horizontal loads generated by wind current and wave drift it should be emphasized that the influence of the mooring on the motion response of the module has a minor effect as it does not sufficiently mitigate the vertical motions heave roll and pitch considered more critical in terms of occupant comfort wang et al 2020 the current study does not apply additional interface connectors constraints or any mechanical joints that may be positioned in between the modules e g bridges pathways and roads in order to characterize the motion behavior of an mfs in real sea conditions in the frequency domain a range of storms with periods range from 5 to 40 s are explored rather than one typical case in the time domain investigation in the frequency domain is a relatively novel design approach as most studies on the topic of modular floating structures are explicitly focused on the connectors flexible or fixed ren et al 2019 riggs et al 2000 1998 riggs and ertekin 1993 xia et al 2016 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a 2015b 2017 however by correlating the modules main particulars to the incident wave periods or by arranging the modules in a way that enables them to perform adequately as individual entities will not only improve their reliability but will also reduce the loads on the connections therefore the results of free floating conditions are required to safely design the connection between two or more adjacent modules this approach opens an interesting debate as to what degree the connectors between adjacent modules are key to the improvement of their motion response and at what cost the level of rigidity of the connection yields a tradeoff between the mfs and the vlfs concepts the mfs is constructed from relatively small rigid modules to facilitate production and to reduce structural loads and costs in case the adjacent modules are fastened with compliant connections i e free floating the global bending moment associated with the structure spatial dimensions is determined by the length of one module 100 m but as the stiffness of the connection between the adjacent modules increases so does the local loads actual connection facilities and the global bending moment determined eventually by the length of all the consolidated modules 1000 m the global bending moments increase exponentially with the systems length until it becomes a vlfs with all the pro and cons discussed earlier the mfs module considered in this study module9000 was designed to meet the imo regulations in adherence to the requirements needed for unrestricted navigation wang et al 2019 however this was done for a standalone module that is not part of a consolidated platform once the modules are combined in their multi body mfs configuration moored side by side and separated by only 4 5 m sts fenders as shown in fig 2 they risk colliding into one another during severe storms in commercial shipping to avoid the risks of harming the ship or the port facilities commercial vessels leave the port during a heavy storm as out at sea far from any objects is the safest place however separating the modules to a safe distance for sufficient clearance before incoming storms is considered impractical in the context of the urban setting 2 2 the typical building units the modules the design methodology of the mfs modules is divided into two main phases based on their requirements 1 ultimate limit state uls and 2 service limit state sls fig 3 shows a proposed algorithm to design a typical module input 1 includes the design parameters for the chosen module configuration e g the geometry of the module and the weights distribution this input data initiates an iterative process encompassed by hydrostatic and structural analysis if the chosen design does not successfully comply to a given set of structural or stability regulations the substructure or superstructure dimensions should be changed this can be done for example by increasing the beam of the substructure to improve stability or by reducing the number of superstructure floors to reduce the load once the design of the module complies to the given regulations the module can be classified as an approved offshore structure based on the class notation it was aiming for however being a valid offshore structure does not necessarily make it a compatible structure for residential use wang et al 2019 therefore input 2 sls includes environment conditions that assess whether this offshore structure is acceptable for residential use mainly from an occupant comfort point of view this is achieved through a hydrodynamic analysis and occupant comfort regulations for residential buildings wang et al 2020 the main building unit for the presented mfs structure in module9000 is a twin hull barge with six buildings 10 floors each as schematically shown in the in fig 2 the main particulars and hydrostatics of module9000 are presented in table 1 for zero trim and zero heel conditions the design origins which have led to this configuration can be found in earlier studies wang et al 2020 2019 the multi body hydrodynamic analysis considers the 15 modules in the northwest corner of the mfs formation shown in fig 2 this is the corner directly facing the waves where the modules responses are expected to have the maximum motion amplitudes the analysis is performed in the frequency domain with no constraints between the modules these free floating conditions simulate the motions of the modules with compliant mooring lines the added stiffness from the mooring does not have a major contribution on the calculated vertical amplitudes in heave roll and pitch associated with occupant comfort special consideration should be given to the stiffness of the selected sts fenders to avoid chaotic motion responses riggs et al 2000 xia et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the current study examines two types of environmental conditions the first condition is sheltered water that represent conditions typical for bays manmade or natural or any type of water inlet that may provide protection from extreme waves storm with return periods of 100 years the second condition is open water where the mfs system is situated in an unprotected area open sea and as this study proves is dependent on breakwaters to reduce the wave amplitudes in extreme weather 2 3 theoretical background the mathematical problem consists of a nonlinear wave structure interaction that solves the velocity potential based on the equation of continuity as given in equation 1 laplace equation 1 2 φ 0 where φ is defined so that φ is the flow velocity the boundary conditions are the seabed wet surface area of the modules kinematic free surface and the radiation conditions the potential flow is formulated under the assumption of incompressible inviscid and irrotational fluid where the wave elevation is of small steepness in respect to kinematic free surface fig 4 shows the analysis model of the fluid structure interaction domain and its coordinate system the formulation of the procedure of the fluid forces on the modules presented in fig 5 leads to the equation of motion a thorough description of the full mathematical formulation can be found in the reference literature e g ansys 2011 and faltinsen 1993 the diffraction force occurs when the incident waves froude krylov force encounter the stationary module and distributes in its presence the radiation force occurs due to the dynamic response of the module caused by the incident wave force which generates additional waves the added mass m a and damping c are the hydrodynamic coefficients 6 6 matrix and k is the hydrostatic restoring matrix acting as spring constants based on the equation of motion the response amplitude operator raos indicated as x can be calculated when writing x x 0 e i ω t and f f 0 e i ω t for an incident wave of unit amplitude as given in equation 2 2 ω 2 m s m a ω i ω c ω k s x ω f ω the raos are principal operators in the hydrodynamic analysis even though they are calculated in the first order they are the input basis for any further analysis including nonlinear analysis in time domain which can simulate nonlinear connections by assuming small wave steepness the calculated raos presented in this study shows the heave pitch and roll motions for modules 1 10 and 15 of the analysis model presented in fig 2 it is performed based on the selected environmental conditions sheltered or open water for both conditions the transition from the linear raos calculated in regular harmonic wave environment to real sea representation irregular waves is performed with the spectral density function in this study the jonswap spectrum was selected as it is appropriate to the waves in the eastern mediterranean sea for the open water conditions drimer and gafter 2017 and the sheltered water conditions near singapore ren et al 2019 in order to understand the global dynamic response of the mfs modules the raos are calculated about the center of gravity cog of each module in various wave lengths based on an earlier hydrodynamic assessment conducted for module9000 it has been established that in terms of absolute values the amplitude in the z direction governs the calculated acceleration for both seakeeping and occupant comfort criteria for residential buildings wang et al 2020 therefore the analysis in this study focuses on heave roll and pitch motions all the degrees of freedom contributing to the motion amplitude in the z direction in addition the position of the modules to the incident waves is in an angle of 45 as oblique wave direction causes lower motion amplitudes than waves on the bow stern or beam wang et al 2020 the mutual motion response between the modules of the mfs fabric is obtained by the mutual reflection of waves between the modules this means that part of the waves induced by motions of the other modules radiation and further on those reflected by other modules come toward the corresponding module as additional incident waves and diffracted the various mutual responses in the hydrodynamic calculation is considered by assuming a linear analysis a local motion matrix for each module is evaluated by assuming that all other modules are dynamically fixed the global response of the mfs is obtained by assembling the obtained local matrices with the combined matrix method that includes 6 n 6 n full hydrodynamic interactions among n bodies kim 2003 lee 1995 according to the linear formulation of the wave body interaction the diffraction force is the integration of the pressure obtained for the fixed bodies problem where all the modules are fixed the radiation forces 6 6 matrix for each module are obtained by oscillating each module in a unit amplitude and a single dof for each of the 6 dofs while the other modules are fixed in this way the equations of motion for each module provide the raos which consider the interaction between all the modules oscillating in 6 dofs correct for the first order aqwa ansys calculate hydrodynamic coefficients which take full account of hydrodynamic interaction up to 20 interacting structures ansys 2011 in this study 15 interacting structures are modeled in the mfs layout fig 2 and five interacting structures are modeled in the seawall section 3 2 a flowchart describing the analysis process graphically is shown in fig 6 3 extreme weather in open and sheltered water conditions 3 1 extreme weather conditions the use of extreme weather input as presented in this section ensures that the multi body mfs configuration will be able to sustain extreme loads without structural damage or failure these conditions allow to explore the modules response at the edge of the loading capacity envelope in terms of wave heights and periods this section examines the extreme weather conditions of the two predefined locations sheltered and open water conditions the analysis is performed by using the analysis procedure outlined in the previous section together with a statistical wave data given in table 2 strom conditions of 50 and 100 years return periods are considered in order to calculate structures endurance at ultimate limit state design uls annual storms one year return are generally considered for service or operational conditions sls but the worst annual storm sets the threshold between the maximum requirement for sls design and the minimum requirement for uls the hydrodynamic analysis is performed with the periods given in table 2 for the two stipulated locations the additional input required for the analysis is given in table 1 to provide a complete assessment on the selected modules response and to present a broader wave spectrum the wave periods at each location are extended in the region of interest sheltered water between 5 00 and 7 00 and open water between 10 90 and 15 89 the number of interval steps is increased to obtain more accurate results the periods taken for the sheltered water location are 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 78 6 56 6 33 6 11 5 89 5 67 5 44 5 22 5 4 5 4 3 4 1 3 9 3 7 3 5 the periods taken for the open water location are 36 34 32 30 28 26 24 22 20 18 16 15 44 14 89 14 33 13 78 13 22 12 67 12 11 11 56 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 the results of the analysis are presented in fig 7 and fig 8 for sheltered and open water conditions respectively the real sea representation rms included in these figures is based on the significant wave heights hm0 given in table 2 fig 7 shows the results of the sheltered water conditions the results yield an adequate motion response in the given storm waves periods the max heave for module 1 in the 100 years storm tp 7 s is 0 211 modules 10 and 15 in the same analysis system have lower motion amplitudes 0 05 and 0 02 respectively due to the protection they receive from the outer modules the rms amplitudes obtained in real sea conditions show the maximum heave for module 1 during a 100 years storm with significant wave height hm0 of 1 8 m is ca 0 057 m the heave motion for modules 10 and 15 are 0 030 m and 0 017 m respectively this means that the multi body configuration successfully reduces the motion amplitudes of the inner modules in these conditions also comfort criteria considered as sls is met with great margins as presented in section 4 for operational conditions the results of the open water conditions are given in fig 8 the results show that the max heave for module 1 in the 100 years storm tp 15 89 s is 0 928 which is almost the same motion amplitude as the incident wave the heave motions of the inner modules 10 and 15 are of the same order of magnitudes as the outer module it is concluded that in these wave periods ca 10 16 s the multi body environment does not provide the required protection or substantial wave attenuation that improves the inner modules motion response the results for real sea representation show that the maximum heave for module 1 in the 100 years storm at a significant wave height hm0 of 8 5 m is about 1 81 m modules 10 and 15 are also oscillating around the same amplitude values with about 1 0 difference from module 1 both results are about three orders of magnitude higher than the value calculated for the sheltered water conditions it is perhaps obvious that the inner modules are better protected in relation to the outer modules directly facing the propagating waves however the study demonstrates the performance boundary of the chosen arrangement to certain sea states wavelength it is further demonstrated that this performance limit is proportional to modules main particulars which is very important design aspect in the two stipulated conditions the heave motion clearly picks up towards 1 0 as the wavelength increases eventually if the wave is long enough the floating body will match to its amplitude this is the tendency of all the axial dofs the rotational dofs on the other hand aspire to zero as the wavelength increases hence there is an inherent relation between the motion response to the module s dimensions which is induced by the propagating wavelength therefore based on the obtained results it is demonstrated that the main particulars of the analyzed modules are adequate for storms with peak period of ca 7 s and wave height of ca 2 m thus in open water conditions the multi body configuration does not provide an effective wave attenuation to the current design of the modules and additional and more effective break water must be applied a proposed breakwater is discussed in the next section 3 2 floating sea wall the calculated vertical motions of the three open water modules investigated in extreme weather conditions are far too great for the realization of urban space at sea the relative vertical motion between two adjacent modules can reach almost 4 0 m making it both impractical and unsafe especially when considering the fact that each module weighs an estimated 31 365 0 tons table 1 the use of constraints connectors to mitigate the vertical displacement is also impractical due to the high loads at the local fastening points there are two ways to surpass this limitation one is by increasing the modules dimensions fig 3 input 1 substructure geometry and two by reducing the wave heights fig 3 input 2 chosen environment the proposal presented in this paper is to reduce the wave heights by using a sustainable floating breakwaters concept floating seawall the incident wave height interacting with the mfs modules must be regulated to match the chosen structural parameters of module9000 naturally the larger the rigid modules are the better they can uphold high waves however by increasing the module s dimensions the associated structural loads influenced chiefly by the global wave bending moment will increase as well and thus increasing costs substantially an alternative way is to place a breakwater to reduce the incoming waves height from an economic point of view the tradeoff between the costs of larger modules and the necessity of a floating breakwater should be investigated on a case by case basis however it is beyond the scope of this study the proposed seawall unit floating breakwater is constructed from decommissioned ultra large crude carrier ulcc with the following dimensions length l 400 beam b 60 and draft t 40 m the modules are comprised of two ulcc hulls rigidly connected alongside with clearance of 20 m between them to increase their effective beam drimer et al 1992 these modules are moored with conventional compliant mooring systems the seawall is positioned 90 to the incident wave headings to maximize the area of sheltered water on its leeward side the mooring system can be designed to meet regulations code such as offshore standard position mooring dnv 2010 or any international association of classification societies iacs equivalent dealing with long term four points mooring in this study the seawall is constructed from five modules spaced 400 m apart the clearance between the two rows is 120 m the second row shifts in x direction exactly 400 m in relation to the first as shown in fig 9 the distance between the seawall units ensures their safety during extreme storms and their spatial layout could be further optimized to meet urban and performance needs the performance of the seawall or any type of floating breakwater is commonly expressed by the transmission coefficient ct written as ct ht hi where ht is the transmitted wave height leeward side of the seawall and hi is the incident wave height peña et al 2011 the hydrodynamics of the presented seawall are analyzed with the wave periods given in table 2 for open water conditions to provide feasible conditions for the open water mfs an attempt was made to reduce the design wave height of 100 years storm t 15 9 s and hmo 8 5 m the presented sea wall configuration fig 9 was chosen and optimized for this task reducing the wave heights of 50 and 100 years storms the parametric study results presented in fig 10 and fig 11 show seawall efficiency in terms of transmitted coefficient ct for 100 t 16 s and annual years storms t 11 s the ct of the annual storm is ca 0 6 where the ct of the 100 years storm is ca 0 2 this is a substantial difference the seawall performance decreased in shorter wave periods as the wavelength is closer to the seawall units dimensions which brings the seawall units to resonate this resonance depicts the dynamic response of the rigid body in waves and must not be confused with the natural frequency of the structure which occurs at much higher frequencies therefore not every type of large structures breakwaters placed in front of an mfs will bring the required wave attenuation as the wave reduction is not linearly satisfied for all cases the full hydrodynamic model in fig 12 shows the 15 mfs modules on the leeward side of the floating seawall in wave periods of 16 s 100 years storm in fig 13 all the transmitted wave values above 0 5 are omitted indicating that the transmission coefficient in the leeward side of the seawall is lower than 0 5 these results are for the floating breakwater system with wavelength to beam ratio λ b of 2 82 where the wavelength λ is ca 395 m and the total beam of the module b is 140 m the wavelength λ is calculated with the dispersion theory for the surface of deep water waves linear wave theory given in equation 3 where t is the wave periods in seconds 3 λ g 2 π t 2 fig 14 shows the 15 mfs modules on the leeward side of the floating seawall in wave periods of 11 s storm with an annual return period in fig 15 all the transmitted wave values above 0 5 are omitted and it is clear that the seawall performance is reduced compared to the results obtained in 16 s the wavelength to beam ratio λ b in this case is 1 32 the results of the open water conditions in the protected side of the seawall are presented in fig 16 both raos and rms the significant wave heights used are taken from table 2 and corresponds to the calculated wave periods table 3 summarizes the rms motion amplitudes for the three modules 1 10 and 15 with or without the floating seawall it is important to note that in the current conditions modules 1 10 and 15 are not the best performing modules within the mfs layout as can be seen in figs 12 and 14 in this section a new and practical method is offered to reduce the wave heights in extreme weather condition using simple reflective rigid floating structures the aim was to reduce the motions of the mfs modules in their multi body environment for safety and structural longevity the results showed that the concept of floating breakwaters made from converted decommissioned ulcc or any other type of large vessels e g fpsos or lng carriers is a valid approach for wave attenuation in addition the seawall modules offer additional urban space inside and on the weather deck which can be utilized for various activities such as parks commercial space offloading platforms storage facilities and different industrial uses 4 operational weather conditions in the context of this research the sls design refers to occupant comfort and is evaluated against the acceptable motion criteria of residential buildings the sheltered water conditions presented in table 2 are considered as very mild this means that anything below these values can be considered calm water conditions where occupant comfort regulations can be met with great margins as can be seen in the results presented in fig 7 therefore in the case of sheltered water the extreme weather conditions provide sufficient input raos and rms to assess its dynamic behavior with relation to occupant comfort regulations and annual wave statistics are not required in operational weather conditions in open water the single module type module9000 reaches a performance limit at significant wave height of ca 1 0 m wang et al 2019 the initial research motivation is to increase the allowable wave height with respect to occupant comfort using multibody configuration this section provides the hydrodynamic behavior of modules 1 10 and 15 in operational weather conditions with the floating seawall alongside the hydrodynamic behavior of a single module in free float without the floating seawall the operational wave conditions used for the open water conditions provides the wave heights periods and their annual probability based on 24 years of measurements and statistical analysis of wave climate levin et al 2019b the processed data is given in table 4 the mfs layout used in the current analysis includes the floating seawall outlined in the previous section the rms values presented in fig 17 shows the amplitudes heave roll and pitch of the three modules 1 10 and 15 together with a single module9000 for reference the periods taken for the analysis are 5 5 5 6 6 5 7 7 5 8 8 5 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 and 20 using the significant wave heights hm0 given in table 4 the amplitudes difference between the single module9000 and the sheltered mfs modules module 1 10 and 15 intensify as the wave height increases in heave motion the modules on the leeward side of the seawall developed half of the motion amplitudes of the reference module form significant wave of 2 m onwards the chart in fig 17 also present the probability of the hm0 as given in table 4 fig 18 shows the acceleration range of the two stipulated conditions sheltered and open water with floating breakwaters against four occupant comfort and seakeeping benchmarks iso 6897 1984 iso 10137 2007 nordforsk 1987 it also includes the single module9000 in free float the backgrounds fields from a to d shows the relevant occupant comfort and seakeeping criteria in terms of allowed accelerations the original iso charts indicate the acceleration range as a function of the frequency f in hz here the results are presented as a function of the significant wave height the relation between the frequency f and the significant wave height hm0 is given in equations 4 and 5 where t p is the peak period in seconds 4 f t p 1 5 t p 5 45 h m 0 the heave rms amplitude are transformed to acceleration with the expression given in equation 6 where ω is the angular frequency radians per second and a is the max rms amplitudes in meters are presented in fig 17 6 a c c r m s ω 2 a the mfs modules perform adequately in all the specified conditions however the performance in open water conditions is entirely dependent on the floating seawall 5 summary and conclusions the current study offers an additional validation for the mfs concept feasibility and its compatibility for offshore dwelling it is demonstrated that the multi body mfs configuration is effective in mitigating the motion amplitudes of the inner modules at short wave periods up to ca 7 s typical to the investigated location near singapore this without the implementation of mechanical constraints or the need of a floating breakwater the fundamental comfort requirements cannot be exclusively dependent on a constraint mechanism but needs to be an integrated part of the inherent stability of the module because mechanical devices are prone to failure naturally constraint mechanism can and should be implemented once the module is inherently stable to deal with smaller oscillation and performance enhancements at longer wave periods typical to the investigated location in the eastern mediterranean sea the floating seawall was proven effective which supports the application of the mfs concept also in open water for the conditions stipulated in this study the combination of relatively small modules and a large vlfs type structure such as the floating seawall is very effective and offer a unique way to explore new design options in addition the positive influence of reusing decommissioned naval structures to create floating breakwater resonates beyond the direct contribution to the mfs feasibility it prevents unaccountable shipbreaking it improves the calculated life cycle assessment of these structures end of life phase and it saves resources and time the seawall configuration presented in this study enables the mfs modules to meet the required occupant comfort standards beyond the significant wave height of 3 0 m using the same environmental conditions without the seawall the modules fail to deliver the required performance at ca 1 5 m significant wave height furthermore the reduction of the modules heave motion amplitudes in extreme weather conditions such as a 100 years storm from 1 83 m without the seawall to 0 68 m with the seawall shows the potential of these composite units in open water conditions of the eastern mediterranean sea the current research validates the concept of modular floating structures for urban use both in mild sea zones and in open water conditions the current study helps to close the gap of the utopian architecture proposals for sustainable offshore dwelling and yields an initial proof of feasibility from the global hydrodynamic response of the mfs the topic presented in the current study calls for additional research from various disciplines in order to encapsulate its entire scope matters such as land use policies life cycle assessment and cost benefit analysis are vital for future implementation that said investigating the contribution of mechanical nonlinear constraint to the

21533,the concept of modular floating structures mfs offers a unique avenue to explore new and sustainable ways for addressing issues of coastal urbanization and sea level rise in the proximity of coastal cities this concept is easily implemented in calm waters without the interference of waves yet its implementation in open water poses greater challenges particularly in terms of habitability and comfort the current study examines the feasibility of the concept in two locations in mild sea zone near singapore and in open water conditions at the eastern mediterranean sea both conditions are examined in operational and extreme storms it is shown that the mfs configuration can attenuate incident waves of short periods this reduces the motion amplitudes of the inner modules with respect to the exterior modules facing the waves it is also presented that during extreme storms the chosen configuration is less effective and the motion amplitudes of all modules within the mfs fabric are almost identical to further increase the acceptable sea states the study proposes a unique floating seawall design which provides a substantial wave reduction in long wave periods the study presents the efficiency of the new configuration in operational weather and a 100 years storm keywords coastal expansion artificial islands modular floating structures hydrodynamic interaction floating breakwaters 1 introduction by 2050 it is estimated that 50 of the global population will live in coastal cities at the frontline of climate change events rosenzweig et al 2010 strain et al 2019 the most prominent of these events being global mean sea level rise slr climbing at an accelerating rate slr continues to baffle scientists that aim to predict its long term projections the challenge in achieving such forecasts is due in most part to the uncertainty regarding the potential contributions of ice sheets greenland and antarctica in 2013 the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc published the comprehensive fifth assessment report ar5 conveying that the total slr will increase in up to ca 1 0 m by 2100 church et al 2013 however a recent study claims that slr will exceed 2 0 m by 2100 more than twice the value put forward by the ipcc just six years earlier bamber et al 2019 for many of the low lying communities it means that the threat is closer and much more grave than previously anticipated furthermore to date 2 4 billion people live in coastal communities 40 of the global population and the demand for urban space is on the rise as a result of demographic and urbanization processes sengupta et al 2018 united nations 2017 in order to overcome these problems the proposed study offers an alternative way to increase the available land resources to the adjacent marine environment of coastal cities by modular floating structures mfs the hypothesis is that mfs offers a unique new and sustainable solution for addressing issues related to coastal urbanization and global sea level rise in addition mfs has the potential to decrease the pressure on greenfield development key in reducing atmospheric co2 answers the demand for real estate closer to urban centers while making use of existing infrastructures e g power plants airports etc the traditional approach for expansion to the marine environment is through land reclamation a destructive and wasteful method that is considered obsolete in many developed countries duan et al 2016 peduzzi 2014 in recent years the concept of very large floating structures vlfs was proclaimed as a more sustainable solution for land reclamation andrianov 2006 drimer and gafter 2017 fujikubo 2005 kashiwagi 2000 ohmatsu 2005 wang et al 2007 but thus far has yet to fulfill its promise this is mainly as a result of production complexity detrimental environmental effects such as the local light climate and its consequences on the ecosystem and high production costs furthermore mega floats are usually designed to serve a single purpose e g airport storage facility etc and are not considered a viable alternative for residential development lamas pardo et al 2015 the mfs concept has the potential to solve all these deficiencies by using medium size relative to operated ship sizes rigid modules that create a large scale consolidated platform for urban development these floating modules or building units can be designed ad hoc for any urban purpose e g residential recreational facilities parks etc and can be arranged and rearranged in numerous spatial configurations this facilitates future growth and development as it can be realized by simply adding new modules in correlation to actual demand the concept of a floating city has been mentioned in the open literature more than 100 years ago french author jules verne 1828 1905 wrote the novels floating city and the floating islands in 1871 and 1895 respectively in more recent years the concept of a floating city composed of modular structures has been rehashed in the conceptual world of architects and town planners some notable examples can be found in the following references burt 2013 czapiewska et al 2013 ingels 2019 olthuis and keuning 2010 to mention only a few however thus far none of these utopian plans have yet to evolve into a complete realization of the program that said offshore technologies have made a great leap forward in recent years in both applications and scientific contributions e g downie et al 2000 hirdaris et al 2014 but these developments are almost exclusively tailored to the needs of the energy industry fossil and renewable to date there is no compliance between the utopian architectural plans and factual offshore engineering fig 1 demonstrates the conceptual gap between architectural proposals fig 1 a c and actual offshore projects from recent years fig 1 d f it is clear that typical offshore structures are too industrial and robust for normative urban applications and perhaps even too expensive therefore in order to bring the urban mfs concept into realization there is a need to narrow the gap between currently available engineering solutions technology and architectural design concept the proposed mfs concept aims to narrow this gap by providing engineering solutions and design methodologies suitable for urban needs offshore the main unit of analysis in this research explores the hydrodynamic responses of the mfs by implementing a multi body configuration to reduce motion amplitudes influencing occupant comfort habitability requirements expected in residential buildings such as occupant comfort criteria adds unique challenges to the design of offshore structures and play a significant role in its feasibility the use of onshore residential regulations for occupant comfort criteria is not widely discussed in the literature however this is one of the main criteria to define the performance limit of the mfs and it must be considered as a primary constraint in the design process in wang et al 2020 it was demonstrated that a single module with compliant mooring reaches a performance limit at a certain sea state this limit relates to the acceptable motions allowed in residential buildings the current study examines whether the allowable significant wave height could be increased by the global responses of the multi body configuration as such this study focuses on the service limit state design of offshore structure for urban use proof of feasibility of mfs from the structural and technological points of view using a multi disciplinary research approach was presented in wang et al 2018 2019 these studies included relevant aspects from the disciplines of naval architecture marine engineering civil engineering and architecture and town planning to solve the hydrodynamics of the proposed concept the analysis system ansys aqwa was used since the aim of the current presented research is to provide a proof of concept it was crucial to use a known and validated numerical tools mendonça ana et al 2012 pérez arribas and lópez piñeiro 2007 ren et al 2019 obviously in order to further capture local phenomena associated to nonlinear structural response or internal forces at the connections of adjacent modules further analysis is required which is beyond the scope of the current study and is considered for future research the study also examines extreme weather events where the use of breakwaters can be crucial conventional breakwaters such as rubble mound caissons or the combination the two composite breakwaters can provide the required wave protection needed for the feasibility of mfs but they pose similar environmental issues to land reclamation they change the natural near shore current destroy coastal sand balance and ecological systems liang et al 2004 in addition to their environmental shortcomings conventional breakwaters are technologically limited where water depth plays a critical role at water deeper than 30 m conventional breakwaters become unrealistic from a financial perspective tutuarima and d angremond 1998 a sustainable alternative to conventional breakwaters is floating breakwaters which allow the transport of water and sand and are not restricted by water depth considering the two alternatives in the context of sea level rise it is obvious that floating breakwaters are preferable because of their ability to adapt naturally to new conditions instead of conventional breakwaters that require continual vertical extension to this end this study examines the efficiency of the conversion of a decommissioned ultra large crude carrier ulcc into a floating breakwater in addition to wave attenuation the reuse of decommissioned ocean going ships helps to mitigate labor and environmental health issues associated with shipbreaking particularly in pakistan india bangladesh and china the main demolition markets of the world demaria 2010 neşer et al 2008 rahman et al 2019 yılmaz et al 2016 moreover it endorses a circular economy approach that reduces resource waste construction time and costs linked with the fabrication of new breakwaters in order to characterize the global dynamic response of the mfs the analysis focuses on a frequency domain to explore the range of wave periods prior to a spectral analysis in time domain for a given significant wave height the hydrodynamic interaction of the chosen 15 modules in the calculated environment is accounted for in the potential function solution the allowable motions in the calculated system adhere primarily to acceleration as a function of the frequencies acceptable in residential buildings iso 6897 1984 it is correlated to tall buildings that are susceptible to wind loads lamb et al 2016 the seakeeping based motion criteria accepted in the marine industry are generally less stringent and therefore may be used as a secondary input to determine the comfort level in relation to motion in the vertical direction only this is achieved by calculating the motion sickness doze value in z direction msdvz iso 2631 1997 the paper is divided into three main sections the first section outlines the methodology and the design procedure for single module and a multi body mfs configuration the next section explores the performance of the mfs in extreme weather for both sheltered and open water conditions which includes the seawall performance the third section investigates the performance of the mfs in operational weather conditions based on long term annual wave statistics the study ends with a summary and conclusions 2 design and methodology for mfs this section outlines the design methodology used in this study both the module and the mfs system are introduced a theoretical background of wave and structure interaction is also concisely discussed together with an explanation of the equation of motion and the response amplitude operator rao hydrodynamic analysis is performed with ansys aqwa that calculates the linear response of the mfs bodies in regular waves mathworks matlab is used for creating the module geometry the boundary elements model and the required input data for ansys aqwa run files in dat format mathworks matlab is also used for post processing which includes data analysis retrieving the relevant data from ansys aqwa output files in lis format and calculating the response amplitude in irregular waves this analysis platform was validated in a previous study for a single module wang et al 2020 in addition to other studies such as drimer and gafter 2017 and the studies by nallayarasu and kumar 2017 rahmdel et al 2016 that have shown good agreement between ansys aqwa and experimental results 2 1 the mfs layout a schematic arrangement of an arbitrary mfs system is presented in fig 2 and is considered in the current study the asymmetry of the layout is intentional as it allows for potential marine traffic to move within the mfs in addition the modules location in the mfs grid could be revised to optimize its performance and to reduce local wave resonance the major openings are currently shown in the leeward side of the schematic mfs in the current study the hydrodynamic analysis represents only the northwest quarter of the mfs layout composed of 15 modules the module type is chosen as module9000 was developed in an earlier study wang et al 2019 and is briefly described in section 2 2 the results throughout this paper are primarily given with respect to three representative modules in line with the waves direction shown in fig 2 as modules 1 10 and 15 the primary wave direction is from 45 to the longitudinal axis of the modules which is an optimal angle of attack for module9000 in terms of minimal motions amplitudes wang et al 2020 since the mfs modules are based on ship manufacturing sizes and maritime standards they can be fabricated at almost any commercial shipyard and as such obviates the need for modifying or creating new facilities in the typical module design module9000 the substructure hull length over all is 100 m and the maximal beam is 30 m this aspect significantly reduces the production costs since the module is within panamax size limits the compliance to marine regulation also dictates more stringent environmental regulations than the customary residential standards onshore marpol 2005 the analysis presented in the current study assumes that the modules are connected by ship to ship sts fenders acting as springs and not as dampers or dashpots and a compliant mooring system the distance between the adjacent modules is 4 5 m which is the diameter of a large off the shelf sts fender the function of the compliant mooring is to keep the modules in their position as schematically shown in fig 2 by resisting the horizontal loads generated by wind current and wave drift it should be emphasized that the influence of the mooring on the motion response of the module has a minor effect as it does not sufficiently mitigate the vertical motions heave roll and pitch considered more critical in terms of occupant comfort wang et al 2020 the current study does not apply additional interface connectors constraints or any mechanical joints that may be positioned in between the modules e g bridges pathways and roads in order to characterize the motion behavior of an mfs in real sea conditions in the frequency domain a range of storms with periods range from 5 to 40 s are explored rather than one typical case in the time domain investigation in the frequency domain is a relatively novel design approach as most studies on the topic of modular floating structures are explicitly focused on the connectors flexible or fixed ren et al 2019 riggs et al 2000 1998 riggs and ertekin 1993 xia et al 2016 xu et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a 2015b 2017 however by correlating the modules main particulars to the incident wave periods or by arranging the modules in a way that enables them to perform adequately as individual entities will not only improve their reliability but will also reduce the loads on the connections therefore the results of free floating conditions are required to safely design the connection between two or more adjacent modules this approach opens an interesting debate as to what degree the connectors between adjacent modules are key to the improvement of their motion response and at what cost the level of rigidity of the connection yields a tradeoff between the mfs and the vlfs concepts the mfs is constructed from relatively small rigid modules to facilitate production and to reduce structural loads and costs in case the adjacent modules are fastened with compliant connections i e free floating the global bending moment associated with the structure spatial dimensions is determined by the length of one module 100 m but as the stiffness of the connection between the adjacent modules increases so does the local loads actual connection facilities and the global bending moment determined eventually by the length of all the consolidated modules 1000 m the global bending moments increase exponentially with the systems length until it becomes a vlfs with all the pro and cons discussed earlier the mfs module considered in this study module9000 was designed to meet the imo regulations in adherence to the requirements needed for unrestricted navigation wang et al 2019 however this was done for a standalone module that is not part of a consolidated platform once the modules are combined in their multi body mfs configuration moored side by side and separated by only 4 5 m sts fenders as shown in fig 2 they risk colliding into one another during severe storms in commercial shipping to avoid the risks of harming the ship or the port facilities commercial vessels leave the port during a heavy storm as out at sea far from any objects is the safest place however separating the modules to a safe distance for sufficient clearance before incoming storms is considered impractical in the context of the urban setting 2 2 the typical building units the modules the design methodology of the mfs modules is divided into two main phases based on their requirements 1 ultimate limit state uls and 2 service limit state sls fig 3 shows a proposed algorithm to design a typical module input 1 includes the design parameters for the chosen module configuration e g the geometry of the module and the weights distribution this input data initiates an iterative process encompassed by hydrostatic and structural analysis if the chosen design does not successfully comply to a given set of structural or stability regulations the substructure or superstructure dimensions should be changed this can be done for example by increasing the beam of the substructure to improve stability or by reducing the number of superstructure floors to reduce the load once the design of the module complies to the given regulations the module can be classified as an approved offshore structure based on the class notation it was aiming for however being a valid offshore structure does not necessarily make it a compatible structure for residential use wang et al 2019 therefore input 2 sls includes environment conditions that assess whether this offshore structure is acceptable for residential use mainly from an occupant comfort point of view this is achieved through a hydrodynamic analysis and occupant comfort regulations for residential buildings wang et al 2020 the main building unit for the presented mfs structure in module9000 is a twin hull barge with six buildings 10 floors each as schematically shown in the in fig 2 the main particulars and hydrostatics of module9000 are presented in table 1 for zero trim and zero heel conditions the design origins which have led to this configuration can be found in earlier studies wang et al 2020 2019 the multi body hydrodynamic analysis considers the 15 modules in the northwest corner of the mfs formation shown in fig 2 this is the corner directly facing the waves where the modules responses are expected to have the maximum motion amplitudes the analysis is performed in the frequency domain with no constraints between the modules these free floating conditions simulate the motions of the modules with compliant mooring lines the added stiffness from the mooring does not have a major contribution on the calculated vertical amplitudes in heave roll and pitch associated with occupant comfort special consideration should be given to the stiffness of the selected sts fenders to avoid chaotic motion responses riggs et al 2000 xia et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 the current study examines two types of environmental conditions the first condition is sheltered water that represent conditions typical for bays manmade or natural or any type of water inlet that may provide protection from extreme waves storm with return periods of 100 years the second condition is open water where the mfs system is situated in an unprotected area open sea and as this study proves is dependent on breakwaters to reduce the wave amplitudes in extreme weather 2 3 theoretical background the mathematical problem consists of a nonlinear wave structure interaction that solves the velocity potential based on the equation of continuity as given in equation 1 laplace equation 1 2 φ 0 where φ is defined so that φ is the flow velocity the boundary conditions are the seabed wet surface area of the modules kinematic free surface and the radiation conditions the potential flow is formulated under the assumption of incompressible inviscid and irrotational fluid where the wave elevation is of small steepness in respect to kinematic free surface fig 4 shows the analysis model of the fluid structure interaction domain and its coordinate system the formulation of the procedure of the fluid forces on the modules presented in fig 5 leads to the equation of motion a thorough description of the full mathematical formulation can be found in the reference literature e g ansys 2011 and faltinsen 1993 the diffraction force occurs when the incident waves froude krylov force encounter the stationary module and distributes in its presence the radiation force occurs due to the dynamic response of the module caused by the incident wave force which generates additional waves the added mass m a and damping c are the hydrodynamic coefficients 6 6 matrix and k is the hydrostatic restoring matrix acting as spring constants based on the equation of motion the response amplitude operator raos indicated as x can be calculated when writing x x 0 e i ω t and f f 0 e i ω t for an incident wave of unit amplitude as given in equation 2 2 ω 2 m s m a ω i ω c ω k s x ω f ω the raos are principal operators in the hydrodynamic analysis even though they are calculated in the first order they are the input basis for any further analysis including nonlinear analysis in time domain which can simulate nonlinear connections by assuming small wave steepness the calculated raos presented in this study shows the heave pitch and roll motions for modules 1 10 and 15 of the analysis model presented in fig 2 it is performed based on the selected environmental conditions sheltered or open water for both conditions the transition from the linear raos calculated in regular harmonic wave environment to real sea representation irregular waves is performed with the spectral density function in this study the jonswap spectrum was selected as it is appropriate to the waves in the eastern mediterranean sea for the open water conditions drimer and gafter 2017 and the sheltered water conditions near singapore ren et al 2019 in order to understand the global dynamic response of the mfs modules the raos are calculated about the center of gravity cog of each module in various wave lengths based on an earlier hydrodynamic assessment conducted for module9000 it has been established that in terms of absolute values the amplitude in the z direction governs the calculated acceleration for both seakeeping and occupant comfort criteria for residential buildings wang et al 2020 therefore the analysis in this study focuses on heave roll and pitch motions all the degrees of freedom contributing to the motion amplitude in the z direction in addition the position of the modules to the incident waves is in an angle of 45 as oblique wave direction causes lower motion amplitudes than waves on the bow stern or beam wang et al 2020 the mutual motion response between the modules of the mfs fabric is obtained by the mutual reflection of waves between the modules this means that part of the waves induced by motions of the other modules radiation and further on those reflected by other modules come toward the corresponding module as additional incident waves and diffracted the various mutual responses in the hydrodynamic calculation is considered by assuming a linear analysis a local motion matrix for each module is evaluated by assuming that all other modules are dynamically fixed the global response of the mfs is obtained by assembling the obtained local matrices with the combined matrix method that includes 6 n 6 n full hydrodynamic interactions among n bodies kim 2003 lee 1995 according to the linear formulation of the wave body interaction the diffraction force is the integration of the pressure obtained for the fixed bodies problem where all the modules are fixed the radiation forces 6 6 matrix for each module are obtained by oscillating each module in a unit amplitude and a single dof for each of the 6 dofs while the other modules are fixed in this way the equations of motion for each module provide the raos which consider the interaction between all the modules oscillating in 6 dofs correct for the first order aqwa ansys calculate hydrodynamic coefficients which take full account of hydrodynamic interaction up to 20 interacting structures ansys 2011 in this study 15 interacting structures are modeled in the mfs layout fig 2 and five interacting structures are modeled in the seawall section 3 2 a flowchart describing the analysis process graphically is shown in fig 6 3 extreme weather in open and sheltered water conditions 3 1 extreme weather conditions the use of extreme weather input as presented in this section ensures that the multi body mfs configuration will be able to sustain extreme loads without structural damage or failure these conditions allow to explore the modules response at the edge of the loading capacity envelope in terms of wave heights and periods this section examines the extreme weather conditions of the two predefined locations sheltered and open water conditions the analysis is performed by using the analysis procedure outlined in the previous section together with a statistical wave data given in table 2 strom conditions of 50 and 100 years return periods are considered in order to calculate structures endurance at ultimate limit state design uls annual storms one year return are generally considered for service or operational conditions sls but the worst annual storm sets the threshold between the maximum requirement for sls design and the minimum requirement for uls the hydrodynamic analysis is performed with the periods given in table 2 for the two stipulated locations the additional input required for the analysis is given in table 1 to provide a complete assessment on the selected modules response and to present a broader wave spectrum the wave periods at each location are extended in the region of interest sheltered water between 5 00 and 7 00 and open water between 10 90 and 15 89 the number of interval steps is increased to obtain more accurate results the periods taken for the sheltered water location are 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 78 6 56 6 33 6 11 5 89 5 67 5 44 5 22 5 4 5 4 3 4 1 3 9 3 7 3 5 the periods taken for the open water location are 36 34 32 30 28 26 24 22 20 18 16 15 44 14 89 14 33 13 78 13 22 12 67 12 11 11 56 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 the results of the analysis are presented in fig 7 and fig 8 for sheltered and open water conditions respectively the real sea representation rms included in these figures is based on the significant wave heights hm0 given in table 2 fig 7 shows the results of the sheltered water conditions the results yield an adequate motion response in the given storm waves periods the max heave for module 1 in the 100 years storm tp 7 s is 0 211 modules 10 and 15 in the same analysis system have lower motion amplitudes 0 05 and 0 02 respectively due to the protection they receive from the outer modules the rms amplitudes obtained in real sea conditions show the maximum heave for module 1 during a 100 years storm with significant wave height hm0 of 1 8 m is ca 0 057 m the heave motion for modules 10 and 15 are 0 030 m and 0 017 m respectively this means that the multi body configuration successfully reduces the motion amplitudes of the inner modules in these conditions also comfort criteria considered as sls is met with great margins as presented in section 4 for operational conditions the results of the open water conditions are given in fig 8 the results show that the max heave for module 1 in the 100 years storm tp 15 89 s is 0 928 which is almost the same motion amplitude as the incident wave the heave motions of the inner modules 10 and 15 are of the same order of magnitudes as the outer module it is concluded that in these wave periods ca 10 16 s the multi body environment does not provide the required protection or substantial wave attenuation that improves the inner modules motion response the results for real sea representation show that the maximum heave for module 1 in the 100 years storm at a significant wave height hm0 of 8 5 m is about 1 81 m modules 10 and 15 are also oscillating around the same amplitude values with about 1 0 difference from module 1 both results are about three orders of magnitude higher than the value calculated for the sheltered water conditions it is perhaps obvious that the inner modules are better protected in relation to the outer modules directly facing the propagating waves however the study demonstrates the performance boundary of the chosen arrangement to certain sea states wavelength it is further demonstrated that this performance limit is proportional to modules main particulars which is very important design aspect in the two stipulated conditions the heave motion clearly picks up towards 1 0 as the wavelength increases eventually if the wave is long enough the floating body will match to its amplitude this is the tendency of all the axial dofs the rotational dofs on the other hand aspire to zero as the wavelength increases hence there is an inherent relation between the motion response to the module s dimensions which is induced by the propagating wavelength therefore based on the obtained results it is demonstrated that the main particulars of the analyzed modules are adequate for storms with peak period of ca 7 s and wave height of ca 2 m thus in open water conditions the multi body configuration does not provide an effective wave attenuation to the current design of the modules and additional and more effective break water must be applied a proposed breakwater is discussed in the next section 3 2 floating sea wall the calculated vertical motions of the three open water modules investigated in extreme weather conditions are far too great for the realization of urban space at sea the relative vertical motion between two adjacent modules can reach almost 4 0 m making it both impractical and unsafe especially when considering the fact that each module weighs an estimated 31 365 0 tons table 1 the use of constraints connectors to mitigate the vertical displacement is also impractical due to the high loads at the local fastening points there are two ways to surpass this limitation one is by increasing the modules dimensions fig 3 input 1 substructure geometry and two by reducing the wave heights fig 3 input 2 chosen environment the proposal presented in this paper is to reduce the wave heights by using a sustainable floating breakwaters concept floating seawall the incident wave height interacting with the mfs modules must be regulated to match the chosen structural parameters of module9000 naturally the larger the rigid modules are the better they can uphold high waves however by increasing the module s dimensions the associated structural loads influenced chiefly by the global wave bending moment will increase as well and thus increasing costs substantially an alternative way is to place a breakwater to reduce the incoming waves height from an economic point of view the tradeoff between the costs of larger modules and the necessity of a floating breakwater should be investigated on a case by case basis however it is beyond the scope of this study the proposed seawall unit floating breakwater is constructed from decommissioned ultra large crude carrier ulcc with the following dimensions length l 400 beam b 60 and draft t 40 m the modules are comprised of two ulcc hulls rigidly connected alongside with clearance of 20 m between them to increase their effective beam drimer et al 1992 these modules are moored with conventional compliant mooring systems the seawall is positioned 90 to the incident wave headings to maximize the area of sheltered water on its leeward side the mooring system can be designed to meet regulations code such as offshore standard position mooring dnv 2010 or any international association of classification societies iacs equivalent dealing with long term four points mooring in this study the seawall is constructed from five modules spaced 400 m apart the clearance between the two rows is 120 m the second row shifts in x direction exactly 400 m in relation to the first as shown in fig 9 the distance between the seawall units ensures their safety during extreme storms and their spatial layout could be further optimized to meet urban and performance needs the performance of the seawall or any type of floating breakwater is commonly expressed by the transmission coefficient ct written as ct ht hi where ht is the transmitted wave height leeward side of the seawall and hi is the incident wave height peña et al 2011 the hydrodynamics of the presented seawall are analyzed with the wave periods given in table 2 for open water conditions to provide feasible conditions for the open water mfs an attempt was made to reduce the design wave height of 100 years storm t 15 9 s and hmo 8 5 m the presented sea wall configuration fig 9 was chosen and optimized for this task reducing the wave heights of 50 and 100 years storms the parametric study results presented in fig 10 and fig 11 show seawall efficiency in terms of transmitted coefficient ct for 100 t 16 s and annual years storms t 11 s the ct of the annual storm is ca 0 6 where the ct of the 100 years storm is ca 0 2 this is a substantial difference the seawall performance decreased in shorter wave periods as the wavelength is closer to the seawall units dimensions which brings the seawall units to resonate this resonance depicts the dynamic response of the rigid body in waves and must not be confused with the natural frequency of the structure which occurs at much higher frequencies therefore not every type of large structures breakwaters placed in front of an mfs will bring the required wave attenuation as the wave reduction is not linearly satisfied for all cases the full hydrodynamic model in fig 12 shows the 15 mfs modules on the leeward side of the floating seawall in wave periods of 16 s 100 years storm in fig 13 all the transmitted wave values above 0 5 are omitted indicating that the transmission coefficient in the leeward side of the seawall is lower than 0 5 these results are for the floating breakwater system with wavelength to beam ratio λ b of 2 82 where the wavelength λ is ca 395 m and the total beam of the module b is 140 m the wavelength λ is calculated with the dispersion theory for the surface of deep water waves linear wave theory given in equation 3 where t is the wave periods in seconds 3 λ g 2 π t 2 fig 14 shows the 15 mfs modules on the leeward side of the floating seawall in wave periods of 11 s storm with an annual return period in fig 15 all the transmitted wave values above 0 5 are omitted and it is clear that the seawall performance is reduced compared to the results obtained in 16 s the wavelength to beam ratio λ b in this case is 1 32 the results of the open water conditions in the protected side of the seawall are presented in fig 16 both raos and rms the significant wave heights used are taken from table 2 and corresponds to the calculated wave periods table 3 summarizes the rms motion amplitudes for the three modules 1 10 and 15 with or without the floating seawall it is important to note that in the current conditions modules 1 10 and 15 are not the best performing modules within the mfs layout as can be seen in figs 12 and 14 in this section a new and practical method is offered to reduce the wave heights in extreme weather condition using simple reflective rigid floating structures the aim was to reduce the motions of the mfs modules in their multi body environment for safety and structural longevity the results showed that the concept of floating breakwaters made from converted decommissioned ulcc or any other type of large vessels e g fpsos or lng carriers is a valid approach for wave attenuation in addition the seawall modules offer additional urban space inside and on the weather deck which can be utilized for various activities such as parks commercial space offloading platforms storage facilities and different industrial uses 4 operational weather conditions in the context of this research the sls design refers to occupant comfort and is evaluated against the acceptable motion criteria of residential buildings the sheltered water conditions presented in table 2 are considered as very mild this means that anything below these values can be considered calm water conditions where occupant comfort regulations can be met with great margins as can be seen in the results presented in fig 7 therefore in the case of sheltered water the extreme weather conditions provide sufficient input raos and rms to assess its dynamic behavior with relation to occupant comfort regulations and annual wave statistics are not required in operational weather conditions in open water the single module type module9000 reaches a performance limit at significant wave height of ca 1 0 m wang et al 2019 the initial research motivation is to increase the allowable wave height with respect to occupant comfort using multibody configuration this section provides the hydrodynamic behavior of modules 1 10 and 15 in operational weather conditions with the floating seawall alongside the hydrodynamic behavior of a single module in free float without the floating seawall the operational wave conditions used for the open water conditions provides the wave heights periods and their annual probability based on 24 years of measurements and statistical analysis of wave climate levin et al 2019b the processed data is given in table 4 the mfs layout used in the current analysis includes the floating seawall outlined in the previous section the rms values presented in fig 17 shows the amplitudes heave roll and pitch of the three modules 1 10 and 15 together with a single module9000 for reference the periods taken for the analysis are 5 5 5 6 6 5 7 7 5 8 8 5 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 and 20 using the significant wave heights hm0 given in table 4 the amplitudes difference between the single module9000 and the sheltered mfs modules module 1 10 and 15 intensify as the wave height increases in heave motion the modules on the leeward side of the seawall developed half of the motion amplitudes of the reference module form significant wave of 2 m onwards the chart in fig 17 also present the probability of the hm0 as given in table 4 fig 18 shows the acceleration range of the two stipulated conditions sheltered and open water with floating breakwaters against four occupant comfort and seakeeping benchmarks iso 6897 1984 iso 10137 2007 nordforsk 1987 it also includes the single module9000 in free float the backgrounds fields from a to d shows the relevant occupant comfort and seakeeping criteria in terms of allowed accelerations the original iso charts indicate the acceleration range as a function of the frequency f in hz here the results are presented as a function of the significant wave height the relation between the frequency f and the significant wave height hm0 is given in equations 4 and 5 where t p is the peak period in seconds 4 f t p 1 5 t p 5 45 h m 0 the heave rms amplitude are transformed to acceleration with the expression given in equation 6 where ω is the angular frequency radians per second and a is the max rms amplitudes in meters are presented in fig 17 6 a c c r m s ω 2 a the mfs modules perform adequately in all the specified conditions however the performance in open water conditions is entirely dependent on the floating seawall 5 summary and conclusions the current study offers an additional validation for the mfs concept feasibility and its compatibility for offshore dwelling it is demonstrated that the multi body mfs configuration is effective in mitigating the motion amplitudes of the inner modules at short wave periods up to ca 7 s typical to the investigated location near singapore this without the implementation of mechanical constraints or the need of a floating breakwater the fundamental comfort requirements cannot be exclusively dependent on a constraint mechanism but needs to be an integrated part of the inherent stability of the module because mechanical devices are prone to failure naturally constraint mechanism can and should be implemented once the module is inherently stable to deal with smaller oscillation and performance enhancements at longer wave periods typical to the investigated location in the eastern mediterranean sea the floating seawall was proven effective which supports the application of the mfs concept also in open water for the conditions stipulated in this study the combination of relatively small modules and a large vlfs type structure such as the floating seawall is very effective and offer a unique way to explore new design options in addition the positive influence of reusing decommissioned naval structures to create floating breakwater resonates beyond the direct contribution to the mfs feasibility it prevents unaccountable shipbreaking it improves the calculated life cycle assessment of these structures end of life phase and it saves resources and time the seawall configuration presented in this study enables the mfs modules to meet the required occupant comfort standards beyond the significant wave height of 3 0 m using the same environmental conditions without the seawall the modules fail to deliver the required performance at ca 1 5 m significant wave height furthermore the reduction of the modules heave motion amplitudes in extreme weather conditions such as a 100 years storm from 1 83 m without the seawall to 0 68 m with the seawall shows the potential of these composite units in open water conditions of the eastern mediterranean sea the current research validates the concept of modular floating structures for urban use both in mild sea zones and in open water conditions the current study helps to close the gap of the utopian architecture proposals for sustainable offshore dwelling and yields an initial proof of feasibility from the global hydrodynamic response of the mfs the topic presented in the current study calls for additional research from various disciplines in order to encapsulate its entire scope matters such as land use policies life cycle assessment and cost benefit analysis are vital for future implementation that said investigating the contribution of mechanical nonlinear constraint to the

21534,the analysis for wave attenuation by multiple thin porous walls submerged in water of uniform finite depth is carried out under the acceptance of linear theory of water waves two different types of barrier configurations are considered namely partially immersed walls and bottom standing walls a set of coupled fredholm type integral equations are obtained for the boundary value problem by employing havelock s inversion formulae and continuity of water wave potential across the gap below or above the walls the methodology adopted to solve these integral equations is multi term galerkin s approximation with chebychev s polynomials as a set of basis functions multiplied by suitable weights also the square root singularity of fluid velocity at the edge of the porous walls is precisely handled the numerical results are depicted for reflection and transmission coefficients dissipation of wave energy and dynamic wave force against wavenumber for different parametric values involving in the barrier configurations this theory demonstrates that the dynamic wave forces exerted on the porous walls are reduced significantly as the magnitude of the porous effect parameter is increased the present study is ratified with the existing results in the literature of water waves for a single as well as double rigid barriers and single porous barrier keywords multiple porous walls havelock s inversion formulae multi term galerkin approximation reflection and transmission coefficients dynamic wave force dissipation of wave energy 1 introduction attenuation of wave height and wave force on the coastal structures and harbours is a crucial challenge for the naval engineers and researchers breakwater of various geometrical configurations are constructed to protect offshore region from the incoming wave attack rigid breakwaters of different configurations are used extensively by dean 1945 ursell 1947 levine and rodemich 1958 evans 1970 porter 1972 and many others researchers during past few decades it is widely accepted that the porous structures are more suitable compared to the rigid structures for designing breakwaters as more wave energy is dissipated and accordingly wave load is reduced on the structure in the last few decades effect of perforated walls on incoming waves have been studied enormously after the work of sollitt and cross 1972 they obtained the solution with a modification to darcy s law for normally incident wave scattering in deep water a porous wavemaker theory with a vertical porous plate was developed by chwang 1983 in finite depth water yu 1995 examined the wave diffraction by a semi infinite porous barriers with boundary condition which found in the formulation of sollitt and cross 1972 employing the method of least square approximation lee and chwang 2000 analyzed the scattering and radiation problems involving porous barriers for four different configurations mciver 2005 investigated wave diffraction by a set of n breakwater segments in water of finite depth and reduced the problem into integral equations using green s theorem isaacson et al 1998 proposed the problem of wave interaction by a thin vertical partially immersed perforated barriers and compared the experimental results of some physical quantities utilizing multi term galerkin approximation li et al 2015 discussed the rapid convergence of the solution to the

recent research works have drawn huge attention to the wave interaction by two or more vertical barriers roy et al 2016a 2016b studied water wave scattering by two unequal vertical barriers and two

considering a small gap approximation evans and porter 2015 examined wave transmission through narrow apertures in barrier across a channel recently roy et al 2019 illustrated scattering of water waves by three different barrier configurations which are partially immersed in water of uniform finite depth under the consideration of linearized water wave theory apart from the problems of porous barriers with uniform porosity wave attenuation by porous barriers having non uniform porosity is a modern issue of significant interest to the researchers tao et al 2009 considered wave diffraction by a perforated circular breakwater with non uniform permeability varies along the direction of circumference of the circular barrier utilizing the scaled boundary finite element method wave interaction with non uniform porous cylinder was studied by song and tao 2010 recently gupta and gayen 2018 2019 and sarkar et al 2020 considered porous barriers of non uniform permeability in water of uniform finite depth the study of water wave scattering by multiple porous barriers has been found in the literature of karmakar et al 2013 and karmakar and soares 2014 who examined flexible porous barriers on obliquely incident surface waves by adopting least square method and wide spacing approximation recently behera et al 2020 proposed the problem of wave attenuation by multiple outer porous barriers of two configurations namely bottom standing and surface piercing in the presence of an inner rigid cylinder they discovered that as the number of outer porous barriers is increased the hydrodynamic forces applied on the inner rigid cylinder are diminished this paper deals with wave attenuation by multiple thin vertical surface piercing as well as bottom standing walls in the water of uniform finite depth assuming linear theory of water waves due to symmetric arrangement of the barriers about mean vertical the velocity potential is divided into two parts as symmetric and anti symmetric employing havelock s inversion formulae the boundary value problem is reduced to a set of coupled integral equations of fredholm type multi term galerkin s technique involving chebychev s polynomials as basis functions multiplied with suitable weights is considered to solve these integral equations approximately numerical estimates of reflection and transmission coefficients wave force and dissipation of wave energy obtained here are plotted graphically against wave number by taking different parametric values the existing results of das et al 1997 mandal and dolai 1994 li et al 2015 lee and chwang 2000 for two or single rigid as well as porous thin partially immersed and bottom standing barriers are recovered in order to ratify the accuracy of the present study 2 mathematical formulation we choose rectangular cartesian coordinate system in which y axis and x z plane being taken as vertically downwards and undisturbed mean free surface respectively in water of

the desired accuracy we consider only three terms n 2 in galerkin s approximation of the functions g j l s a t j l 1 2 and take into account sufficient number of terms of each infinite series arising in mathematical formulation the square root singularities at sharp and submerged ends of the porous walls have been handled with proper choice of basis functions in galerkin s approximations 6 1 validation of our present result in table 1 a and 1b a comparison between our present results and the results of table 1 of das et al 1997 has been established for partially immersed and bottom standing walls respectively in both of these two configurations the parametric values are taken as a 1 h a 2 h 0 2 b 1 h 0 3 b 2 h 0 301 g j 0 so that the four barrier configuration becomes nearly a double barrier configuration an agreement up to 3 4 decimal places of our present results with those of das et al 1997 is observed from tables 1 a and 1b thereby confirming that for very close values of b 1 h and b 2 h the four vertical walls behave as two vertical walls table 2 a and 2b exhibit comparisons between our present results and the results of tables 1 and 4 of mandal and dolai 1994 for a single thin vertical rigid barrier agreement of these two results up to 2 3 decimal places establishes that the results of a single partially immersed barrier or a single bottom standing barrier can be recovered for very small spacing between the barriers both tables 1 and 2 validate the exactness of the present method and the accuracy of the numerical estimates in table 3 our result obtained from the present method is compared with the results of tables 5 and 6 of li et al 2015 for b 1 h 0 001 b 2 h 0 2 g j 1 0 25 i α 0 with different truncation size of the infinite sum for the velocity potential these comparisons show quite a good agreement of 3 4 decimal places for both the two configurations of the porous barriers this again validates the accuracy of our adapted method tables 4 a and 4b stand to ratify the correctness of the expression of the wave energy dissipation as given in 5 6 the estimates for r 2 t 2 and 1 j are presented in tables 4a and 4b for respectively partially immersed and bottom standing walls with a 1 h 0 25 a 2 h 0 45 b 1 h 0 7 b 2 h 0 8 g j 1 0 25 i α 60 the graphs of figs 6 and 10 in lee and chwang 2000 for a single porous barrier have been recovered in fig 3 by taking a 1 h a 2 h 0 5 b 1 h 0 001 b 2 h 0 0011 α 0 for partially immersed barrier and with a 1 h a 2 h 0 25 b 1 h 0 001 b 2 h 0 0011 α 0 for bottom standing barrier respectively the asterisks in fig 3 represent the results of lee and chwang 2000 and the coincidence of the asterisks on the graphs corresponding to our results ratifies the correctness of the present method 6 2 results for partially immersed walls in fig 4 r is plotted against k h for different values of the porous effect parameter g j with b 1 h 0 5 b 2 h 1 0 α 30 fig 4 a is depicted for equal walls with a 1 h a 2 h 0 5 and fig 4 b is depicted for unequal walls with a 1 h 0 3 a 2 h 0 5 these two figures reveals that r does not vanish for porous walls g j 0 5 whereas r vanishes at some discrete frequencies for rigid walls g j 0 the effect of porosity upon the reflection and transmission coefficients is observed in fig 5 both the fig 5 a and 5b presents three graphs for respectively the absolute value of reflection and transmission coefficients against k h corresponding to g j 0 1 1 i the values of the other parameters are chosen as a 1 h 0 4 a 2 h 0 65 b 1 h 3 0 b 2 h 5 0 and α 60 fig 5 a shows that maxima of r decrease whereas fig 5 b shows that minima of t increase as the magnitude of permeability increases this phenomenon is due to the dissipation of wave energy through the pores of the walls the effect of separation lengths between the walls on the magnitude of reflection and transmission coefficients is examined in fig 6 in this figure r and t are depicted against k h with different lengths of separation between the four walls with a 1 h a 2 h 0 45 α 45 it can be drawn as an observation from the fig 6 a and 6b that the amount of reflection increases and the amount of transmission decreases with increasing lengths of separation between the barriers with different angles of incidence α 0 45 60 r and t are plotted in fig 7 taking a 1 h 0 15 a 2 h 0 35 b 1 h 3 5 b 2 h 6 0 g j 1 it is observed from the three graphs of fig 7 a and 7b that oscillations in both r and t increase as the angle of the incoming waves decreases it is also observed from fig 7 b that an increase in angle of incidence also increases amount of transmission in fig 8 dimensionless wave force w f is depicted against wave number for different values of the porous effect parameter g j 0 5 1 1 i taking a 1 h 0 25 a 2 h 0 45 b 1 h 3 5 b 2 h 4 5 α 60 this figure demonstrates that as the magnitude of the porous effect parameter increases the hydrodynamic wave forces exerted on the walls diminishes significantly dissipation of wave energy and dimensionless wave force are depicted in fig 9 a and 9b for different angles of incidence α 0 30 45 60 with a 1 h 0 45 a 2 h 0 25 b 1 h 2 0 b 2 h 3 0 g j 0 5 i these results exhibit that more energy is dissipated and consequently wave force is reduced on the walls with angle of incidence 6 3 results for bottom standing walls the numerical estimates of r for four bottom standing walls are depicted in fig 10 a and 10b for b 1 h 1 5 b 2 h 3 0 α 45 with two different values of porous effect parameter g j the graphs of fig 10 a are plotted for equal walls with a 1 h a 2 h 0 5 and the graphs of fig 10b are depicted for two unequal walls with a 1 h 0 3 a 2 h 0 5 it is observed from fig 10 a and 10b that r vanishes at some discrete frequencies for rigid walls g j 0 in fig 11 r and t are depicted against k h for a 1 h 0 25 a 2 h 0 55 b 1 h 3 5 b 2 h 4 0 α 60 three graphs in each of fig 11 a and 11b are plotted corresponding to g j 0 1 1 i fig 11 a shows that the amount of reflection decreases as magnitude of porosity increases and fig 11 b exhibits that amount of transmission increases as the porosity increases in case of porous walls g j 1 1 i the effect of different angles of incidence waves on the magnitude of reflection and transmission coefficients is shown in fig 12 the configuration of the bottom standing walls are chosen as a 1 h 0 45 a 2 h 0 65 b 1 h 2 5 b 2 h 4 0 g j 1 i like partially immersed walls more oscillation in r is observed in fig 12 a with decreasing angle of incidence in this case too it is observed from the fig 12 b that amount of transmission increases as the angle of incidence increases in fig 13 dissipation of wave energy j is plotted against wavenumber for three different barrier configurations viz four barriers two barriers and a single barrier with g j 1 α 45 the values of the associated parameters are taken as a 1 h 0 35 a 2 h 0 55 b 1 h 3 0 b 2 h 5 0 for four barriers a two barrier configuration is obtained from this four barrier configuration by taking b 1 h 3 0 b 2 h 3 001 according to this configuration the two barriers are immersed in finite depth water from depth a 2 below the mean surface a single barrier configuration is obtained from those four barriers by considering a 1 h 0 35 a 2 h 0 999 b 1 h 0 001 b 2 h 3 001 and this single barrier is immersed from depth a 1 below the mean free surface within uniform depth water this graphical depiction affirms that more wave energy is dissipated as the number walls increases thus multiple walls helps to reduce wave energy on the barrier and protect the offshore structure as well the dimensionless wave force is depicted against wavenumber for different magnitude of porous effect parameter g j 0 5 1 1 i in fig 14 with a 1 h 0 45 a 2 h 0 25 b 1 h 2 5 b 2 h 4 0 α 30 it is noticed from fig 14 that amount of wave force on the walls reduces as the magnitude of the porous effect parameter increases a comparative study has been carried out for the dissipation of wave energy and the dimensionless wave force over the angle of incidence in fig 15 a and 15b by depicting these two physical quantities against wavenumber we take a 1 h 0 55 a 2 h 0 35 b 1 h 1 0 b 2 h 3 0 g j 1 i in both the two figures the same behaviour as established in fig 9 a and 9b for partially immersed walls is also observed in this case also 7 conclusions the present study deals with the problem of wave attenuation by multiple thin vertical permeable walls in uniform finite depth havelock s expansion of water wave potential alongwith havelock s inversion formulae have been employed to reduce the bvp to a pair of integral equations in terms of difference of potentials multi term galerkin approximation technique is then employed to obtain approximate solution of these integral equations considering the square root singularity at the edge of the walls the basis functions are chosen to be chebychev s polynomials multiplied by suitable weights some existing results in the literature of water waves are recovered in order to ratify the exactness and the accuracy of the present method some new interesting results are exhibited graphically for reflection and transmission coefficients wave energy dissipation dimensionless hydrodynamic wave force our study reveals that the dissipation of wave energy increases and consequently wave force on the walls decreases as the angle of incidence decreases moreover few comparative results between walls of equal lengths and unequal lengths are presented graphically more reflection of incident waves is observed with increasing magnitude of porous effect parameter in addition to increase the lengths of separation between the walls helps to enhance the oscillatory behaviour of r also a remarkable observation that multiple barriers are more efficient for reducing wave energy is exhibited in few graphical representation credit authorship

21534,the analysis for wave attenuation by multiple thin porous walls submerged in water of uniform finite depth is carried out under the acceptance of linear theory of water waves two different types of barrier configurations are considered namely partially immersed walls and bottom standing walls a set of coupled fredholm type integral equations are obtained for the boundary value problem by employing havelock s inversion formulae and continuity of water wave potential across the gap below or above the walls the methodology adopted to solve these integral equations is multi term galerkin s approximation with chebychev s polynomials as a set of basis functions multiplied by suitable weights also the square root singularity of fluid velocity at the edge of the porous walls is precisely handled the numerical results are depicted for reflection and transmission coefficients dissipation of wave energy and dynamic wave force against wavenumber for different parametric values involving in the barrier configurations this theory demonstrates that the dynamic wave forces exerted on the porous walls are reduced significantly as the magnitude of the porous effect parameter is increased the present study is ratified with the existing results in the literature of water waves for a single as well as double rigid barriers and single porous barrier keywords multiple porous walls havelock s inversion formulae multi term galerkin approximation reflection and transmission coefficients dynamic wave force dissipation of wave energy 1 introduction attenuation of wave height and wave force on the coastal structures and harbours is a crucial challenge for the naval engineers and researchers breakwater of various geometrical configurations are constructed to protect offshore region from the incoming wave attack rigid breakwaters of different configurations are used extensively by dean 1945 ursell 1947 levine and rodemich 1958 evans 1970 porter 1972 and many others researchers during past few decades it is widely accepted that the porous structures are more suitable compared to the rigid structures for designing breakwaters as more wave energy is dissipated and accordingly wave load is reduced on the structure in the last few decades effect of perforated walls on incoming waves have been studied enormously after the work of sollitt and cross 1972 they obtained the solution with a modification to darcy s law for normally incident wave scattering in deep water a porous wavemaker theory with a vertical porous plate was developed by chwang 1983 in finite depth water yu 1995 examined the wave diffraction by a semi infinite porous barriers with boundary condition which found in the formulation of sollitt and cross 1972 employing the method of least square approximation lee and chwang 2000 analyzed the scattering and radiation problems involving porous barriers for four different configurations mciver 2005 investigated wave diffraction by a set of n breakwater segments in water of finite depth and reduced the problem into integral equations using green s theorem isaacson et al 1998 proposed the problem of wave interaction by a thin vertical partially immersed perforated barriers and compared the experimental results of some physical quantities utilizing multi term galerkin approximation li et al 2015 discussed the rapid convergence of the solution to the problem of water wave scattering by thin vertical porous barriers sahoo et al 2000 analyzed the trapping and generation of surface wave by submerged vertical porous barriers in finite water depth few recent research works have drawn huge attention to the wave interaction by two or more vertical barriers roy et al 2016a 2016b studied water wave scattering by two unequal vertical barriers and two submerged plates by adopting galerkin s approximation technique teng et al 2018 employed boundary element method bem to discuss wave transmission through vertical thin walls with apertures in channels considering a small gap approximation evans and porter 2015 examined wave transmission through narrow apertures in barrier across a channel recently roy et al 2019 illustrated scattering of water waves by three different barrier configurations which are partially immersed in water of uniform finite depth under the consideration of linearized water wave theory apart from the problems of porous barriers with uniform porosity wave attenuation by porous barriers having non uniform porosity is a modern issue of significant interest to the researchers tao et al 2009 considered wave diffraction by a perforated circular breakwater with non uniform permeability varies along the direction of circumference of the circular barrier utilizing the scaled boundary finite element method wave interaction with non uniform porous cylinder was studied by song and tao 2010 recently gupta and gayen 2018 2019 and sarkar et al 2020 considered porous barriers of non uniform permeability in water of uniform finite depth the study of water wave scattering by multiple porous barriers has been found in the literature of karmakar et al 2013 and karmakar and soares 2014 who examined flexible porous barriers on obliquely incident surface waves by adopting least square method and wide spacing approximation recently behera et al 2020 proposed the problem of wave attenuation by multiple outer porous barriers of two configurations namely bottom standing and surface piercing in the presence of an inner rigid cylinder they discovered that as the number of outer porous barriers is increased the hydrodynamic forces applied on the inner rigid cylinder are diminished this paper deals with wave attenuation by multiple thin vertical surface piercing as well as bottom standing walls in the water of uniform finite depth assuming linear theory of water waves due to symmetric arrangement of the barriers about mean vertical the velocity potential is divided into two parts as symmetric and anti symmetric employing havelock s inversion formulae the boundary value problem is reduced to a set of coupled integral equations of fredholm type multi term galerkin s technique involving chebychev s polynomials as basis functions multiplied with suitable weights is considered to solve these integral equations approximately numerical estimates of reflection and transmission coefficients wave force and dissipation of wave energy obtained here are plotted graphically against wave number by taking different parametric values the existing results of das et al 1997 mandal and dolai 1994 li et al 2015 lee and chwang 2000 for two or single rigid as well as porous thin partially immersed and bottom standing barriers are recovered in order to ratify the accuracy of the present study 2 mathematical formulation we choose rectangular cartesian coordinate system in which y axis and x z plane being taken as vertically downwards and undisturbed mean free surface respectively in water of

vertical rigid wall extending throughout the fluid region with appropriate use of green s identity to the functions φ x y and its complex conjugate φ x y we have derived the energy identity relation considering that the whole fluid region is bounded by the lines y 0 b 2 x c x b 2 0 0 y a 2 y 0 b 1 x b 2 x b 1 0 0 y a 1 y 0 b 1 x b 1 x b 1 0 0 y a 1 y 0 b 2 x b 1 x b 2 0 0 y a 2 y 0 c x b 2 x c 0

transmission coefficients dissipation of wave energy and dimensionless wave force are evaluated with different parametric values and depicted against wavenumber in several figures in order to achieve the desired accuracy we consider only three terms n 2 in galerkin s approximation of the functions g j l s a t j l 1 2 and take into account sufficient number of terms of each infinite series arising in mathematical formulation the square root singularities at sharp and submerged ends of the porous walls have been handled with proper choice of basis functions in galerkin s approximations 6 1 validation of our present result in table 1 a and 1b a comparison between our present results and the results of table 1 of das et al 1997 has been established for partially immersed and bottom standing walls respectively in both of these two configurations the parametric values are taken as a 1 h a 2 h 0 2 b 1 h 0 3 b 2 h 0 301 g j 0 so that the four barrier configuration becomes nearly a double barrier configuration an agreement up to 3 4 decimal places of our present results with those of das et al 1997 is observed from tables 1 a and 1b thereby confirming that for very close values of b 1 h and b 2 h the four vertical walls behave as two vertical walls table 2 a and 2b exhibit comparisons between our present results and the results of tables 1 and 4 of mandal and dolai 1994 for a single thin vertical rigid barrier agreement of these two results up to 2 3 decimal places establishes that the results of a single partially immersed barrier or a single bottom standing barrier can be recovered for very small spacing between the barriers both tables 1 and 2 validate the exactness of the present method and the accuracy of the numerical estimates in table 3 our result obtained from the present method is compared with the results of tables 5 and 6 of li et al 2015 for b 1 h 0 001 b 2 h 0 2 g j 1 0 25 i α 0 with different truncation size of the infinite sum for the velocity potential these comparisons show quite a good agreement of 3 4 decimal places for both the two configurations of the porous barriers this again validates the accuracy of our adapted method tables 4 a and 4b stand to ratify the correctness of the expression of the wave energy dissipation as given in 5 6 the estimates for r 2 t 2 and 1 j are presented in tables 4a and 4b for respectively partially immersed and bottom standing walls with a 1 h 0 25 a 2 h 0 45 b 1 h 0 7 b 2 h 0 8 g j 1 0 25 i α 60 the graphs of figs 6 and 10 in lee and chwang 2000 for a single porous barrier have been recovered in fig 3 by taking a 1 h a 2 h 0 5 b 1 h 0 001 b 2 h 0 0011 α 0 for partially immersed barrier and with a 1 h a 2 h 0 25 b 1 h 0 001 b 2 h 0 0011 α 0 for bottom standing barrier respectively the asterisks in fig 3 represent the results of lee and chwang 2000 and the coincidence of the asterisks on the graphs corresponding to our results ratifies the correctness of the present method 6 2 results for partially immersed walls in fig 4 r is plotted against k h for different values of the porous effect parameter g j with b 1 h 0 5 b 2 h 1 0 α 30 fig 4 a is depicted for equal walls with a 1 h a 2 h 0 5 and fig 4 b is depicted for unequal walls with a 1 h 0 3 a 2 h 0 5 these two figures reveals that r does not vanish for porous walls g j 0 5 whereas r vanishes at some discrete frequencies for rigid walls g j 0 the effect of porosity upon the reflection and transmission coefficients is observed in fig 5 both the fig 5 a and 5b presents three graphs for respectively the absolute value of reflection and transmission coefficients against k h corresponding to g j 0 1 1 i the values of the other parameters are chosen as a 1 h 0 4 a 2 h 0 65 b 1 h 3 0 b 2 h 5 0 and α 60 fig 5 a shows that maxima of r decrease whereas fig 5 b shows that minima of t increase as the magnitude of permeability increases this phenomenon is due to the dissipation of wave energy through the pores of the walls the effect of separation lengths between the walls on the magnitude of reflection and transmission coefficients is examined in fig 6 in this figure r and t are depicted against k h with different lengths of separation between the four walls with a 1 h a 2 h 0 45 α 45 it can be drawn as an observation from the fig 6 a and 6b that the amount of reflection increases and the amount of transmission decreases with increasing lengths of separation between the barriers with different angles of incidence α 0 45 60 r and t are plotted in fig 7 taking a 1 h 0 15 a 2 h 0 35 b 1 h 3 5 b 2 h 6 0 g j 1 it is observed from the three graphs of fig 7 a and 7b that oscillations in both r and t increase as the angle of the incoming waves decreases it is also observed from fig 7 b that an increase in angle of incidence also increases amount of transmission in fig 8 dimensionless wave force w f is depicted against wave number for different values of the porous effect parameter g j 0 5 1 1 i taking a 1 h 0 25 a 2 h 0 45 b 1 h 3 5 b 2 h 4 5 α 60 this figure demonstrates that as the magnitude of the porous effect parameter increases the hydrodynamic wave forces exerted on the walls diminishes significantly dissipation of wave energy and dimensionless wave force are depicted in fig 9 a and 9b for different angles of incidence α 0 30 45 60 with a 1 h 0 45 a 2 h 0 25 b 1 h 2 0 b 2 h 3 0 g j 0 5 i these results exhibit that more energy is dissipated and consequently wave force is reduced on the walls with angle of incidence 6 3 results for bottom standing walls the numerical estimates of r for four bottom standing walls are depicted in fig 10 a and 10b for b 1 h 1 5 b 2 h 3 0 α 45 with two different values of porous effect parameter g j the graphs of fig 10 a are plotted for equal walls with a 1 h a 2 h 0 5 and the graphs of fig 10b are depicted for two unequal walls with a 1 h 0 3 a 2 h 0 5 it is observed from fig 10 a and 10b that r vanishes at some discrete frequencies for rigid walls g j 0 in fig 11 r and t are depicted against k h for a 1 h 0 25 a 2 h 0 55 b 1 h 3 5 b 2 h 4 0 α 60 three graphs in each of fig 11 a and 11b are plotted corresponding to g j 0 1 1 i fig 11 a shows that the amount of reflection decreases as magnitude of porosity increases and fig 11 b exhibits that amount of transmission increases as the porosity increases in case of porous walls g j 1 1 i the effect of different angles of incidence waves on the magnitude of reflection and transmission coefficients is shown in fig 12 the configuration of the bottom standing walls are chosen as a 1 h 0 45 a 2 h 0 65 b 1 h 2 5 b 2 h 4 0 g j 1 i like partially immersed walls more oscillation in r is observed in fig 12 a with decreasing angle of incidence in this case too it is observed from the fig 12 b that amount of transmission increases as the angle of incidence increases in fig 13 dissipation of wave energy j is plotted against wavenumber for three different barrier configurations viz four barriers two barriers and a single barrier with g j 1 α 45 the values of the associated parameters are taken as a 1 h 0 35 a 2 h 0 55 b 1 h 3 0 b 2 h 5 0 for four barriers a two barrier configuration is obtained from this four barrier configuration by taking b 1 h 3 0 b 2 h 3 001 according to this configuration the two barriers are immersed in finite depth water from depth a 2 below the mean surface a single barrier configuration is obtained from those four barriers by considering a 1 h 0 35 a 2 h 0 999 b 1 h 0 001 b 2 h 3 001 and this single barrier is immersed from depth a 1 below the mean free surface within uniform depth water this graphical depiction affirms that more wave energy is dissipated as the number walls increases thus multiple walls helps to reduce wave energy on the barrier and protect the offshore structure as well the dimensionless wave force is depicted against wavenumber for different magnitude of porous effect parameter g j 0 5 1 1 i in fig 14 with a 1 h 0 45 a 2 h 0 25 b 1 h 2 5 b 2 h 4 0 α 30 it is noticed from fig 14 that amount of wave force on the walls reduces as the magnitude of the porous effect parameter increases a comparative study has been carried out for the dissipation of wave energy and the dimensionless wave force over the angle of incidence in fig 15 a and 15b by depicting these two physical quantities against wavenumber we take a 1 h 0 55 a 2 h 0 35 b 1 h 1 0 b 2 h 3 0 g j 1 i in both the two figures the same behaviour as established in fig 9 a and 9b for partially immersed walls is also observed in this case also 7 conclusions the present study deals with the problem of wave attenuation by multiple thin vertical permeable walls in uniform finite depth havelock s expansion of water wave potential alongwith havelock s inversion formulae have been employed to reduce the bvp to a pair of integral equations in terms of difference of potentials multi term galerkin approximation technique is then employed to obtain approximate solution of these integral equations considering the square root singularity at the edge of the walls the basis functions are chosen to be chebychev s polynomials multiplied by suitable weights some existing results in the literature of water waves are recovered in order to ratify the exactness and the accuracy of the present method some new interesting results are exhibited graphically for reflection and transmission coefficients wave energy dissipation dimensionless hydrodynamic wave force our study reveals that the dissipation of wave energy increases and consequently wave force on the walls decreases as the angle of incidence decreases moreover few comparative results between walls of equal lengths and unequal lengths are presented graphically more reflection of incident waves is observed with increasing magnitude of porous effect parameter in addition to increase the lengths of separation between the walls helps to enhance the oscillatory behaviour of r also a remarkable observation that multiple barriers are more efficient for reducing wave energy is exhibited in few graphical representation credit authorship
