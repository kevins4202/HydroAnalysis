1745,groundwater provides perennial ubiquitous and high quality freshwater supplies for humanity globally difficulties in the collection and collation of groundwater records have hindered our understanding of large scale groundwater dynamics this study collected groundwater level depth gld records from 909 groundwater wells across china and the spatiotemporal changes in gld were investigated in unconfined and confined aquifers from 2005 to 2016 nationally the gld distributions were highly heterogeneous with average standard deviation glds of 11 9 20 3 and 21 6 26 4 m in unconfined and confined aquifers respectively from 2005 to 2016 the glds decreased significantly over the energy limited region due to increased precipitation but increased significantly over the water limited region due to high groundwater abstraction the gld changes in confined aquifers were larger than those in unconfined aquifers due to the smaller storativity in confined aquifers the correlations between the glds and grace total water storage tws anomalies over the water limited region were higher than those over the energy limited region indicating that groundwater storage contributed more to tws over arid areas than humid areas this study highlights the increasing groundwater storage in the energy limited region and the decreasing groundwater storage in the water limited region i e enhanced regional differences in groundwater resources the results improve our understanding of groundwater dynamics in different aquifers and climatic conditions and hence advance robust groundwater management and policy development in china keywords groundwater level depth climatic conditions grace tws water limited conditions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater is a perennial ubiquitous and high quality freshwater resource that provides approximately 50 of the water supply for domestic and agricultural irrigation water consumption globally cuthbert et al 2019 siebert et al 2010 the availability of groundwater resources has become an important factor influencing population growth and distribution industrial structures and socioeconomic development especially in arid and semiarid regions around the world noori et al 2021 wada et al 2010 understanding groundwater dynamics under global change is critical for enhancing global water and food security both now and in the future jasechko and perrone 2021 rodell et al 2009 groundwater level depth gld is the depth to the water level below the land surface which is a primary measure used in groundwater resource research anderson 2007 fan et al 2013 because the spatiotemporal distributions of glds directly reflect the availability of groundwater resources glds have been widely investigated at local and regional scales by hydrogeological agricultural and socioeconomic research communities belder et al 2004 cheng and wu 2007 green et al 2011 a general conclusion of these past studies is that intensified water consumption has led to gld deepening over areas that have been highly dependent on groundwater resources for human livelihoods and socioeconomic development pauloo et al 2020 shrestha 2021 zhang et al 2021 nevertheless due to the limited groundwater observations and difficulties of gld record collection few studies have investigated gld dynamics at large scales such as at the national continental and global scales berghuijs et al 2022 doll and fiedler 2008 fan et al 2013 taylor et al 2013 fan et al 2013 attempted to present a global pattern of shallow glds using records compiled from government archives and published literature but the reliability of the gld results in africa and asia has yet to be verified due to large data gaps noori et al 2021 recently investigated gld variations in the arid part of iran from 2002 to 2015 using high resolution groundwater measurements and provided ground based evidence of iran s widespread groundwater depletion these studies focused on shallow gld dynamics over arid regions few studies have been concerned with deep gld dynamics at large scales especially over humid regions in many global scale groundwater studies the relatively humid regions were excluded due to the limited observation records in these regions berghuijs et al 2022 fan et al 2013 moreover two basic scientific questions need to be answered what are the differences between gld changes in different aquifers i e shallow versus deep aquifers and unconfined versus confined aquifers what are the main factors influencing gld changes under different climatic conditions gld dynamics in different aquifers reflect groundwater storage changes at different depths and glds examined under different climatic conditions reflect the influences of climate on groundwater variations china spans multiple climatic zones and is one of the most water stressed countries in the world jia et al 2019 qiu 2010 because groundwater is an important water resource many studies have investigated gld changes in certain regions of china especially over the north china plain duan et al 2015 sun et al 2019 yang et al 2021 for example yang et al 2021 studied gld evaluations in the north china plain in the past 40 years and found that glds decreased in both unconfined and confined aquifers however an in depth investigation of gld dynamics in different aquifers across china has not been conducted thus far in addition a comparison of gld changes under different climatic conditions needs to be further investigated this study employed gld records derived from 909 groundwater wells across china during 2005 2016 to address the two scientific issues mentioned above specifically the objectives of this study are to i analyze the gld changes in unconfined and confined aquifers under different climatic conditions and ii explore the main natural and anthropogenic factors influencing the intra annual and interannual gld changes the results will be critical to understanding groundwater characteristics and controls in various aquifers and climatic regions and hence advance groundwater management and policy development nationally 2 materials and methods the gld records were obtained from the geological environment monitoring yearbook of china groundwater level depth compiled by the china institute of geological environment monitoring the yearbook has been published since 2005 and data from 2005 to 2016 were used in this study the gld was measured using automatic monitoring equipment e g pressure water level gauges and manual monitoring equipment e g measuring ropes clocks and sounders the monitoring frequencies included daily 5 day 10 day 15 day and monthly frequencies depending on the local reliance on groundwater resources and the available monitoring equipment a negative value indicates that the water level was above ground this occurred mainly in natural outcrops and under artesian conditions the gld observations obtained in confined aquifers describe the energy state of the aquifer including the pressure potential which is absent in the measurements of unconfined aquifers these gld measurements were located in regions that were not directly affected by groundwater abstraction gld records from approximately 1700 groundwater wells were documented in the yearbook due to both human and equipment issues that naturally arise the records contained missing and invalid values leading to incomplete time series wells with at least five years of complete records were selected to investigate the intra annual groundwater cycle in this study the selection of a five year threshold represented a tradeoff between the data series length and well number which could reflect relatively stable states of hydrological variables when the data were insufficient and allowed more wells to be used thus resulting in more spatially representative samples zhang et al 2016b the gld records of 909 wells met these criteria including 496 unconfined wells and 413 confined wells table 1 for the unconfined wells the proportions of porous karst and fractured aquifers were 92 3 6 9 and 0 4 respectively fig 1 for the confined wells the proportions of these three aquifer types were 72 2 22 5 and 4 8 respectively all the records were aggregated into monthly average values to facilitate comparisons among wells anomalies of glds were calculated as the deviations of the monthly values from the annual average value which were used to analyze the intra annual groundwater characteristics nevertheless the selected gld time series were inappropriate for the trend analysis one reason was that the five year as well as the six year and seven year records for some wells were relatively short compared to the 12 year study period the other reason was that large uncertainties existed when no data were available at the beginning and end of a time series two criteria were further proposed to ensure the accuracy of the trend analysis and the use of as much data as possible the time series must have contained i at least 8 years of complete records during the study period and ii at least one year of complete records between the first two and last two years of the study period gld records of 219 unconfined wells and 167 confined wells were chosen for the trend analysis because hydrological variables have clear seasonal components the average seasonal cycle is always removed from monthly values when the data series length is limited pascolini campbell et al 2021 wang et al 2018b the deseasonalized gld can be calculated as follows zhang et al 2016a 1 d g l d i g l d i g l d j where dgld i m is the deseasonalized gld gld i m is the monthly gld and g l d j is the average gld in a given month where j i 12 i 12 1 leads to 1 j 12 linear regression via least squares estimation was used to determine the dgld trends and student s t test was conducted to determine whether the trend was significant at the 95 p 0 05 99 p 0 01 and 99 9 p 0 001 confidence levels ramsey 1980 winter 2013 three climatic regions were classified based on the aridity index ai proposed by mcvicar et al 2012 the energy limited region ai 0 76 equitant region 0 76 ai 1 35 and water limited region ai 1 35 fig s1 the ai is the ratio of the mean annual potential evapotranspiration pet to precipitation pet was estimated by the penman monteith model recommended by the food and agriculture organization this model is commonly used in investigations of climatic classifications allen et al 1998 greve et al 2019 the equitant region represents a transitional zone meaning that the climatic characteristics may straddle those of energy limited and water limited regions the evapotranspiration data were obtained from an evapotranspiration dataset based on the penman monteith leuning model with a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 zhang et al 2019 the monthly total water storage anomaly twsa data were collected from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace rl06 mascon solutions version rl06m processed by the center for space research with a resolution of 0 25 0 25 save et al 2016 all grid data were resampled to a 0 5 0 5 resolution pearson correlation coefficients were used to investigate the relationships between the glds and grace twsas since they can represent the causal relationships between the changes in gld and total water storage tws the water supply for human use and the renewable groundwater data of provincial administrative divisions were collected from the water resources bulletin released by the ministry of water resources of china mwrc 2016 different geologic basins cover multiple administrative divisions the water supply data in terms of water sources included data on the surface water supply groundwater supply i e groundwater abstraction and other water supplies such as sewage treatment and seawater desalination the renewable groundwater data contained the amount of precipitation and surface water that served to recharge aquifers although the water supply and renewable groundwater data have uncertainties due to illegal pumping and nonmeasured abstractions this issued dataset is authoritative and relatively reliable two ratios reflecting groundwater use statuses were calculated to explore the potential causes of gld changes 2 r gw ws gw ws total 100 3 r g w m a x ws gw gw renewable 100 where ws gw and ws total are the groundwater supply volume km3 and total water supply volume km3 respectively gw renewable is the renewable groundwater volume km3 r gw is the proportion of the current groundwater supply to the total water supply and r g w m a x is the proportion of the groundwater supply to the renewable groundwater which represents the balance between groundwater supply and recharge under sustainable conditions if r g w m a x is 100 it indicates that the groundwater abstraction exceeds its renewable capacity 3 results 3 1 intra annual gld patterns in unconfined and confined aquifers in china fig 2 shows the gld distributions of groundwater wells in unconfined and confined aquifers across china the spatial coverage of these groundwater wells in the east was much denser than that in the west reflecting the current groundwater use status across china fig 2a b the dense population and fast developing economy in the east are highly dependent on groundwater resources especially in the northern china central china and eastern china fig s2 the gld values in unconfined aquifers ranged from 0 8 to 240 m with an average of 11 9 m and a standard deviation of 20 3 m fig 2a the glds in confined aquifers were between 0 9 and 314 m with an average of 21 6 m and a standard deviation of 26 4 m fig 2b the gld values in confined aquifers were approximately twice as deep as those in unconfined aquifers fig 2d e shows the intra annual variations of glds in unconfined and confined aquifers under three climatic regions for a given climatic region the glds in unconfined aquifers exhibited similar seasonal patterns as those in confined aquifers but the maximum and minimum values occurred in different months between the two aquifer types for the energy limited region the largest glds in confined aquifers occurred two months before those in unconfined aquifers january versus march whereas the smallest glds in these two aquifer types occurred in the same month july for the water limited region both the largest and smallest glds in unconfined aquifers occurred one month before those in confined aquifers june versus july and january versus february in addition the aquifer types influence the gld variations fig 3 shows that the magnitudes of intra annual gld variations were largest in fractured aquifers followed by karst aquifers and porous aquifers this is because the storativity values are smallest in fractured aquifers followed by karst aquifers and porous aquifers generally the gld patterns identified over the energy limited region are opposite to those identified over the water limited region for both unconfined and confined aquifers fig 2d e in the energy limited region a larger gld corresponds to a lower precipitation fig 2f g and vice versa as unconfined aquifers are likely to be recharged by precipitation in this region moeck et al 2020 however in the water limited region the intra annual glds are affected by the combined effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration fig s3 the groundwater level pattern is opposite of the precipitation pattern due to the high evapotranspiration occurring during the summer months condon et al 2020 gnann et al 2019 this can be confirmed by the findings of wang et al 2018a who demonstrated that groundwater was not supplemented by increased precipitation but was consumed by evapotranspiration in arid regions notably evapotranspiration induced by groundwater fed irrigation is important in shaping the gld patterns over the water limited region guo and shen 2015 pan et al 2017 for example pan et al 2017 found that evapotranspiration induced by groundwater fed irrigation accounted for 29 55 of the total evapotranspiration during the growing season march may of winter wheat in the haihe river basin of china it is interesting that the glds from march to may showed rapid increases in this region fig s2c we speculate that these changes may have been caused by significant groundwater extraction for irrigation during this period 3 2 interannual gld changes in unconfined and confined aquifers across china the trends in the deseasonalized glds dglds in unconfined aquifers are shown in fig 4 a which varied between 2 34 and 2 07 m a 1 the dglds in unconfined aquifers increased significantly p 0 01 at 115 out of 219 wells whereas they decreased significantly p 0 01 at 59 wells among the unconfined wells 30 82 and 107 wells were located in the energy limited equitant and water limited regions respectively regarding the regional average the dgld decreased significantly at a rate of 0 06 m a 1 p 0 001 in the energy limited region fig 5 a the dglds in the equitant and water limited regions increased significantly at rates of 0 05 p 0 001 and 0 12 p 0 001 m a 1 respectively fig 5b c to exclude the effect of bias induced by large gld changes in only a few aquifers we repeated the analysis 1000 times by randomly resampling 95 of the wells each time and found consistent changes in each case gray curves in fig 5 notably because only 30 wells were located in the energy limited region the repeated analyses were conducted for a reduced 435 iterations in addition fig 4a shows that there were two zones with dense groundwater monitoring the beijing tianjin zone and the henan plain zone the dglds changed dramatically from 0 73 to 2 07 m a 1 in the beijing tianjin zone fig 4b and increased significantly in most wells in the henan plain zone fig 4c the dgld changes in confined aquifers ranged from 3 76 to 2 25 m a 1 which were larger than those in unconfined aquifers fig 4d this is because confined aquifers have relatively small storativity and thus small volume changes lead to large head changes in these aquifers kuang et al 2020 sophocleous 1991 the dglds in confined aquifers increased significantly p 0 01 at 80 out of 167 wells and decreased significantly p 0 01 at 63 wells two zones in fig 4d exhibited significantly increasing dgld trends the beijing tianjin zone fig 4e and the northern anhui jiangsu zone fig 4f these two zones have high domestic water consumption and agricultural water abstraction long et al 2020 thomas 2008 it is worth noting that the northern anhui jiangsu zone experienced a significant precipitation reduction from 2005 to 2016 which was also an important cause of the increasing glds in this zone fig s4 among the confined wells 52 63 and 52 wells were located in the energy limited equitant and water limited regions respectively regarding the regional average the dgld decreased significantly at a rate of 0 29 p 0 001 fig 4d m a 1 for the energy limited region and increased significantly at a rate of 0 37 p 0 001 fig 4f m a 1 over the water limited region indicating increased net groundwater recharge in the humid areas and increased groundwater discharge in the arid areas although the dgld decreased insignificantly p 0 1 over the equitant region from 2005 to 2016 local characteristics should be noted fig s5 in terms of void types the decrease in dgld for porous aquifers was much larger than that for karst aquifers 0 44 m a 1 versus 0 03 m a 1 fig 6 for confined aquifers in the energy limited region 3 3 potential causes of regional differences in gld trends this study finds significant regional differences in interannual gld changes the glds increased in the water limited region of china which was consistent with the results of existing research in china and other arid regions around the world cao et al 2014 noori et al 2021 as stated in previous studies the deepening of glds in arid areas is mainly due to groundwater abstraction for different purposes such as domestic water supply agricultural irrigation socioeconomic development and ecosystem conservation aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 ashraf et al 2017 feng et al 2013 fig 7 shows the proportions of the groundwater supply to the total water supply i e r gw in the provincial administrative divisions of china the r gw values in the equitant and water limited administrative divisions were much larger than those in the energy limited administrative divisions specifically the two largest r gw values pink bars in fig 7 were 77 4 and 59 2 in hebei and beijing water limited administrative divisions respectively although the absolute groundwater supply volume decreased and annual precipitation increased in these two administrative divisions from 2005 to 2016 the glds continued to increase i e groundwater depletion continued to occur fig s6m n this was because the groundwater supply far exceeded the renewable groundwater with r g w m a x values of 124 8 and 104 7 for hebei and beijing respectively red bars in fig 7 various measures have been implemented to address groundwater depletion in this region including establishing the south to north water diversion project reducing irrigation consumption improving water efficiency and implementing tiered water prices chen et al 2013 shen and wu 2017 zhou et al 2020 long et al 2020 indicated that the groundwater depletion in beijing was reduced by 6 4 km3 approximately 0 39 m from 2006 to 2018 under the combined impacts of water diverted by the south to north water diversion project and the implementation of irrigation reduction policies nevertheless the r gw and r g w m a x values in the energy limited administrative divisions were much smaller than those in the water limited and equitant administrative divisions as abundant surface water can meet the demands of human water use the gld changes were almost unaffected by the groundwater supply but were impacted by precipitation in some administrative divisions with low ai values fig 8 a for example the glds tended to decrease due to increased precipitation in jiangxi zhejiang and hunan fig s6a c this finding can be confirmed by the results of moeck et al 2020 who indicated that there was a high dependency of groundwater recharge on precipitation in humid areas in addition fig 8b shows the relationships between the glds and grace twsas as groundwater is an important component of the tws generally the changes in gld and twsa were negatively correlated in each aquifer because small gld means large groundwater storage and vice versa the negative relationships were grouped for the three climatic regions because they can represent the causal relationships between the changes in gld and tws fig 9 the mean correlation coefficients r in unconfined aquifers for the energy limited equitant and water limited regions were 0 39 0 43 and 0 51 respectively fig 9b and the mean r values in the confined aquifers were 0 41 0 45 and 0 51 for those three climatic regions fig 9d the r values over the water limited region were larger than those over the energy limited region both in unconfined and confined aquifers indicating that groundwater storage contributed more to tws over relatively arid areas than over relatively humid areas although the glds in unconfined and confined aquifers reflect groundwater storage dynamics under different hydrogeologic conditions the correlation coefficients between the glds and twsas were similar between the two aquifers positive correlation coefficients existed fig 9a and 9c which might be caused by two reasons i groundwater only accounts for a small proportion of the tws and there is no causal relationship between the two factors so the correlation coefficients are only statistical values and ii phase time lags exist between physical processes which means that large scale trends picked up by the grace satellites on a different spatial and temporal scale are not yet reflected in the gld changes müller schmied et al 2014 nazemi and wheater 2015 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with previous studies generally gld studies based on observation records are inadequate in relatively humid regions of asia in the literature berghuijs et al 2022 fan et al 2013 moeck et al 2020 for example fan et al 2013 presented global distributions of shallow glds at 1 603 781 well sites compiled from government archives and published literature but large data gaps for asia remained berghuijs et al 2022 used a global synthesis of field estimated 5237 sites groundwater recharge to show that first order recharge follows a simple function of ai but humid regions were excluded due to the data shortages for domestic studies in china numerous studies have investigated gld changes in arid regions especially in the north china plain liu and zheng 2016 pan et al 2017 whereas gld studies in humid regions were limited and have focused mainly on a few sites and regional scales liu et al 2023 yang et al 2012 the current status of insufficient research on glds in humid regions hampers the comprehensive understanding of global groundwater dynamics the launch of grace satellites provided a new perspective and means to investigate groundwater dynamics massoud et al 2021 save et al 2016 scanlon et al 2018 groundwater storage variations can be obtained from the difference between the grace tws and surface water as well as the soil water estimated from hydrological and land surface models liu et al 2019 massoud et al 2018 rateb et al 2020 the trends in gld could be deduced from grace based groundwater storage variations however there are two disadvantages of grace based gld studies first the true gld values are difficult to quantify due to the lack of hydrogeological data the gld is an important hydrologic variable because its depth directly determines whether human access to groundwater is feasible second this method cannot obtain spatial distributions of groundwater at a relatively finer resolution due to the footprint of grace satellites numerical simulations are another commonly used method for groundwater studies and these methods include groundwater models hydrological models land surface models and earth system models fan et al 2013 li et al 2022 rateb et al 2020 scanlon et al 2018 due to the lack of monitoring records these simulations performed at large scales have been rarely calibrated or validated with groundwater observations often leading to unreliable results observed glds are benchmarks of groundwater studies based on remote sensing and numeric modeling this study presents the true values and trends in glds in china and summarizes the differences in gld variations in unconfined and confined aquifers which helps to improve the reliability of groundwater estimations using remote sensing and numerical simulations at large scales 4 2 limitations and future research several issues faced in this research may be examined in future studies first this study used observed data as much as possible to ensure the reliability of the results however the spatial distribution of groundwater wells in this dataset was uneven with a denser well network in the east than in the west which reflected the spatial distributions of groundwater use fig 7 the dense population and fast developing economy are highly dependent on groundwater resources in the east especially in the beijing tianjin zone in addition although the gld data were only 12 years in length and were not enough to reflect the complete groundwater cycle this is a relatively complete long and available dataset second the groundwater monitoring methods and frequencies varied among the groundwater wells thus leading to uncertainties in the results liu and zheng 2016 despite that manual monitoring is not as precise as automatic monitoring both approaches reflect groundwater changes the differential trends and changes in glds are the most important in groundwater research in addition the records were processed into monthly values to reduce the impact of different monitoring frequencies third uncertainties exist in the arithmetic mean method and linear trend test used in this study a random resampling approach was used to reduce the effect of these methods on the results finally whilst this study examined the causation in spatial and temporal trends in gld this study did not attempt to quantify and model the innate groundwater physics that would lead to the causation due to the lack of information about groundwater physical factors such as geological features and hydraulic parameters which control the hydraulic response throughout an aquifer and throughout time abbott et al 2019 milly et al 2014 scanlon et al 2018 shen 2018 further work is warranted to determine the more precise physical mechanisms including important geologic and hydrogeologic controls for the causality and trends noted in this analysis 5 summary and conclusion this study investigated the spatiotemporal gld changes in unconfined and confined aquifers across china from 2005 to 2016 for the first time the results showed that the glds in both unconfined and confined aquifers decreased over the energy limited region but increased over the water limited region the gld variations were mainly impacted by increased precipitation in the energy limited region and by groundwater abstraction in the water limited region the correlations between the glds and grace twsas were higher over the water limited region than over the energy limited region indicating that groundwater storage contributes more to tws over relatively arid areas than humid areas this study elucidates key trends in glds under different climatic conditions and highlights enhanced regional differences in groundwater resources i e increasing groundwater storage in humid areas and decreasing groundwater storage in arid areas the results extend the current scope of groundwater research and fill the gap in the primary large scale groundwater research in humid regions of china these improved understandings of groundwater in turn vitally underpin robust groundwater management and policy

the gld records of 909 wells met these criteria including 496 unconfined wells and 413 confined wells table 1 for the unconfined wells the proportions of porous karst and fractured aquifers were 92 3 6 9 and 0 4 respectively fig 1 for the confined wells the proportions of these three aquifer types were 72 2 22 5 and 4 8 respectively all the records were aggregated into monthly average values to facilitate comparisons among wells anomalies of glds were calculated as the deviations of the monthly values from the annual average value which were used to analyze the intra annual groundwater characteristics nevertheless the selected gld time series were inappropriate for the trend analysis one reason was that the five year as well as the six year and seven year records for some wells were relatively short compared to the 12 year study period the other reason was that large uncertainties existed when no data were available at the beginning and end of a time series two criteria were further proposed to ensure the accuracy of the trend analysis and the use of as much data as possible the time series must have contained i at least 8 years of complete records during the study period and ii at least one year of complete records between the first two and last two years of the study period gld records of 219 unconfined wells and 167 confined wells were chosen for the trend analysis because hydrological variables have clear seasonal components the average seasonal cycle is always removed from monthly values when the data series length is limited pascolini campbell et al 2021 wang et al 2018b the deseasonalized gld can be calculated as follows zhang et al 2016a 1 d g l d i g l d i g l d j where dgld i m is the deseasonalized gld gld i m is the monthly gld and g l d j is the average gld in a given month where j i 12 i 12 1 leads to 1 j 12 linear regression via least squares estimation was used to determine the dgld trends and student s t test was conducted to determine whether the trend was significant at the 95 p 0 05 99 p 0 01 and 99 9 p 0 001 confidence levels ramsey 1980 winter 2013 three climatic regions were classified based on the aridity index ai proposed by mcvicar et al 2012 the energy limited region ai 0 76 equitant region 0 76 ai 1 35 and water limited region ai 1 35 fig s1 the ai is the ratio of the mean annual potential evapotranspiration pet to precipitation pet was estimated by the penman monteith model recommended by the food and agriculture organization this model is commonly used in investigations of climatic classifications allen et al 1998 greve et al 2019 the equitant region represents a transitional zone meaning that the climatic characteristics may straddle those of energy limited and water limited regions the evapotranspiration data were obtained from an evapotranspiration dataset based on the penman monteith leuning model with a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 zhang et al 2019 the monthly total water storage anomaly twsa data were collected from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace rl06 mascon solutions version rl06m processed by the center for space research with a resolution of 0 25 0 25 save et al 2016 all grid data were resampled to a 0 5 0 5 resolution pearson correlation coefficients were used to investigate the relationships between the glds and grace twsas since they can represent the causal relationships between the changes in gld and total water storage tws the water supply for human use and the renewable groundwater data of provincial administrative divisions were collected from the water resources bulletin released by the ministry of water resources of china mwrc 2016 different geologic basins cover multiple administrative divisions the water supply data in terms of water sources included data on the surface water supply groundwater supply i e groundwater abstraction and other water supplies such as sewage treatment and seawater desalination the renewable groundwater data contained the amount of precipitation and surface water that served to recharge aquifers although the water supply and renewable groundwater data have uncertainties due to illegal pumping and nonmeasured abstractions this issued dataset is authoritative and relatively reliable two ratios reflecting groundwater use statuses were calculated to explore the potential causes of gld changes 2 r gw ws gw ws total 100 3 r g w m a x ws gw gw renewable 100 where ws gw and ws total are the groundwater supply volume km3 and total water supply volume km3 respectively gw renewable is the renewable groundwater volume km3 r gw is the proportion of the current groundwater supply to the total water supply and r g w m a x is the proportion of the groundwater supply to the renewable groundwater which represents the balance between groundwater supply and recharge under sustainable conditions if r g w m a x is 100 it indicates that the groundwater abstraction exceeds its renewable capacity 3 results 3 1 intra annual gld patterns in unconfined and confined aquifers in china fig 2 shows the gld distributions of groundwater wells in unconfined and confined aquifers across china the spatial coverage of these groundwater wells in the east was much denser than that in the west reflecting the current groundwater use status across china fig 2a b the dense population and fast developing economy in the east are highly dependent on groundwater resources especially in the northern china central china and eastern china fig s2 the gld values in unconfined aquifers ranged from 0 8 to 240 m with an average of 11 9 m and a standard deviation of 20 3 m fig 2a the glds in confined aquifers were between 0 9 and 314 m with an average of 21 6 m and a standard deviation of 26 4 m fig 2b the gld values in confined aquifers were approximately twice as deep as those in unconfined aquifers fig 2d e shows the intra annual variations of glds in unconfined and confined aquifers under three climatic regions for a given climatic region the glds in unconfined aquifers exhibited similar seasonal patterns as those in confined aquifers but the maximum and minimum values occurred in different months between the two aquifer types for the energy limited region the largest glds in confined aquifers occurred two months before those in unconfined aquifers january versus march whereas the smallest glds in these two aquifer types occurred in the same month july for the water limited region both the largest and smallest glds in unconfined aquifers occurred one month before those in confined aquifers june versus july and january versus february in addition the aquifer types influence the gld variations fig 3 shows that the magnitudes of intra annual gld variations were largest in fractured aquifers followed by karst aquifers and porous aquifers this is because the storativity values are smallest in fractured aquifers followed by karst aquifers and porous aquifers generally the gld patterns identified over the energy limited region are opposite to those identified over the water limited region for both unconfined and confined aquifers fig 2d e in the energy limited region a larger gld corresponds to a lower precipitation fig 2f g and vice versa as unconfined aquifers are likely to be recharged by precipitation in this region moeck et al 2020 however in the water limited region the intra annual glds are affected by the combined effects of precipitation and evapotranspiration fig s3 the groundwater level pattern is opposite of the precipitation pattern due to the high evapotranspiration occurring during the summer months condon et al 2020 gnann et al 2019 this can be confirmed by the findings of wang et al 2018a who demonstrated that groundwater was not supplemented by increased precipitation but was consumed by evapotranspiration in arid regions notably evapotranspiration induced by groundwater fed irrigation is important in shaping the gld patterns over the water limited region guo and shen 2015 pan et al 2017 for example pan et al 2017 found that evapotranspiration induced by groundwater fed irrigation accounted for 29 55 of the total evapotranspiration during the growing season march may of winter wheat in the haihe river basin of china it is interesting that the glds from march to may showed rapid increases in this region fig s2c we speculate that these changes may have been caused by significant groundwater extraction for irrigation during this period 3 2 interannual gld changes in unconfined and confined aquifers across china the trends in the deseasonalized glds dglds in unconfined aquifers are shown in fig 4 a which varied between 2 34 and 2 07 m a 1 the dglds in unconfined aquifers increased significantly p 0 01 at 115 out of 219 wells whereas they decreased significantly p 0 01 at 59 wells among the unconfined wells 30 82 and 107 wells were located in the energy limited equitant and water limited regions respectively regarding the regional average the dgld decreased significantly at a rate of 0 06 m a 1 p 0 001 in the energy limited region fig 5 a the dglds in the equitant and water limited regions increased significantly at rates of 0 05 p 0 001 and 0 12 p 0 001 m a 1 respectively fig 5b c to exclude the effect of bias induced by large gld changes in only a few aquifers we repeated the analysis 1000 times by randomly resampling 95 of the wells each time and found consistent changes in each case gray curves in fig 5 notably because only 30 wells were located in the energy limited region the repeated analyses were conducted for a reduced 435 iterations in addition fig 4a shows that there were two zones with dense groundwater monitoring the beijing tianjin zone and the henan plain zone the dglds changed dramatically from 0 73 to 2 07 m a 1 in the beijing tianjin zone fig 4b and increased significantly in most wells in the henan plain zone fig 4c the dgld changes in confined aquifers ranged from 3 76 to 2 25 m a 1 which were larger than those in unconfined aquifers fig 4d this is because confined aquifers have relatively small storativity and thus small volume changes lead to large head changes in these aquifers kuang et al 2020 sophocleous 1991 the dglds in confined aquifers increased significantly p 0 01 at 80 out of 167 wells and decreased significantly p 0 01 at 63 wells two zones in fig 4d exhibited significantly increasing dgld trends the beijing tianjin zone fig 4e and the northern anhui jiangsu zone fig 4f these two zones have high domestic water consumption and agricultural water abstraction long et al 2020 thomas 2008 it is worth noting that the northern anhui jiangsu zone experienced a significant precipitation reduction from 2005 to 2016 which was also an important cause of the increasing glds in this zone fig s4 among the confined wells 52 63 and 52 wells were located in the energy limited equitant and water limited regions respectively regarding the regional average the dgld decreased significantly at a rate of 0 29 p 0 001 fig 4d m a 1 for the energy limited region and increased significantly at a rate of 0 37 p 0 001 fig 4f m a 1 over the water limited region indicating increased net groundwater recharge in the humid areas and increased groundwater discharge in the arid areas although the dgld decreased insignificantly p 0 1 over the equitant region from 2005 to 2016 local characteristics should be noted fig s5 in terms of void types the decrease in dgld for porous aquifers was much larger than that for karst aquifers 0 44 m a 1 versus 0 03 m a 1 fig 6 for confined aquifers in the energy limited region 3 3 potential causes of regional differences in gld trends this study finds significant regional differences in interannual gld changes the glds increased in the water limited region of china which was consistent with the results of existing research in china and other arid regions around the world cao et al 2014 noori et al 2021 as stated in previous studies the deepening of glds in arid areas is mainly due to groundwater abstraction for different purposes such as domestic water supply agricultural irrigation socioeconomic development and ecosystem conservation aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 ashraf et al 2017 feng et al 2013 fig 7 shows the proportions of the groundwater supply to the total water supply i e r gw in the provincial administrative divisions of china the r gw values in the equitant and water limited administrative divisions were much larger than those in the energy limited administrative divisions specifically the two largest r gw values pink bars in fig 7 were 77 4 and 59 2 in hebei and beijing water limited administrative divisions respectively although the absolute groundwater supply volume decreased and annual precipitation increased in these two administrative divisions from 2005 to 2016 the glds continued to increase i e groundwater depletion continued to occur fig s6m n this was because the groundwater supply far exceeded the renewable groundwater with r g w m a x values of 124 8 and 104 7 for hebei and beijing respectively red bars in fig 7 various measures have been implemented to address groundwater depletion in this region including establishing the south to north water diversion project reducing irrigation consumption improving water efficiency and implementing tiered water prices chen et al 2013 shen and wu 2017 zhou et al 2020 long et al 2020 indicated that the groundwater depletion in beijing was reduced by 6 4 km3 approximately 0 39 m from 2006 to 2018 under the combined impacts of water diverted by the south to north water diversion project and the implementation of irrigation reduction policies nevertheless the r gw and r g w m a x values in the energy limited administrative divisions were much smaller than those in the water limited and equitant administrative divisions as abundant surface water can meet the demands of human water use the gld changes were almost unaffected by the groundwater supply but were impacted by precipitation in some administrative divisions with low ai values fig 8 a for example the glds tended to decrease due to increased precipitation in jiangxi zhejiang and hunan fig s6a c this finding can be confirmed by the results of moeck et al 2020 who indicated that there was a high dependency of groundwater recharge on precipitation in humid areas in addition fig 8b shows the relationships between the glds and grace twsas as groundwater is an important component of the tws generally the changes in gld and twsa were negatively correlated in each aquifer because small gld means large groundwater storage and vice versa the negative relationships were grouped for the three climatic regions because they can represent the causal relationships between the changes in gld and tws fig 9 the mean correlation coefficients r in unconfined aquifers for the energy limited equitant and water limited regions were 0 39 0 43 and 0 51 respectively fig 9b and the mean r values in the confined aquifers were 0 41 0 45 and 0 51 for those three climatic regions fig 9d the r values over the water limited region were larger than those over the energy limited region both in unconfined and confined aquifers indicating that groundwater storage contributed more to tws over relatively arid areas than over relatively humid areas although the glds in unconfined and confined aquifers reflect groundwater storage dynamics under different hydrogeologic conditions the correlation coefficients between the glds and twsas were similar between the two aquifers positive correlation coefficients existed fig 9a and 9c which might be caused by two reasons i groundwater only accounts for a small proportion of the tws and there is no causal relationship between the two factors so the correlation coefficients are only statistical values and ii phase time lags exist between physical processes which means that large scale trends picked up by the grace satellites on a different spatial and temporal scale are not yet reflected in the gld changes müller schmied et al 2014 nazemi and wheater 2015 4 discussion 4 1 comparison with previous studies generally gld studies based on observation records are inadequate in relatively humid regions of asia in the literature berghuijs et al 2022 fan et al 2013 moeck et al 2020 for example fan et al 2013 presented global distributions of shallow glds at 1 603 781 well sites compiled from government archives and published literature but large data gaps for asia remained berghuijs et al 2022 used a global synthesis of field estimated 5237 sites groundwater recharge to show that first order recharge follows a simple function of ai but humid regions were excluded due to the data shortages for domestic studies in china numerous studies have investigated gld changes in arid regions especially in the north china plain liu and zheng 2016 pan et al 2017 whereas gld studies in humid regions were limited and have focused mainly on a few sites and regional scales liu et al 2023 yang et al 2012 the current status of insufficient research on glds in humid regions hampers the comprehensive understanding of global groundwater dynamics the launch of grace satellites provided a new perspective and means to investigate groundwater dynamics massoud et al 2021 save et al 2016 scanlon et al 2018 groundwater storage variations can be obtained from the difference between the grace tws and surface water as well as the soil water estimated from hydrological and land surface models liu et al 2019 massoud et al 2018 rateb et al 2020 the trends in gld could be deduced from grace based groundwater storage variations however there are two disadvantages of grace based gld studies first the true gld values are difficult to quantify due to the lack of hydrogeological data the gld is an important hydrologic variable because its depth directly determines whether human access to groundwater is feasible second this method cannot obtain spatial distributions of groundwater at a relatively finer resolution due to the footprint of grace satellites numerical simulations are another commonly used method for groundwater studies and these methods include groundwater models hydrological models land surface models and earth system models fan et al 2013 li et al 2022 rateb et al 2020 scanlon et al 2018 due to the lack of monitoring records these simulations performed at large scales have been rarely calibrated or validated with groundwater observations often leading to unreliable results observed glds are benchmarks of groundwater studies based on remote sensing and numeric modeling this study presents the true values and trends in glds in china and summarizes the differences in gld variations in unconfined and confined aquifers which helps to improve the reliability of groundwater estimations using remote sensing and numerical simulations at large scales 4 2 limitations and future research several issues faced in this research may be examined in future studies first this study used observed data as much as possible to ensure the reliability of the results however the spatial distribution of groundwater wells in this dataset was uneven with a denser well network in the east than in the west which reflected the spatial distributions of groundwater use fig 7 the dense population and fast developing economy are highly dependent on groundwater resources in the east especially in the beijing tianjin zone in addition although the gld data were only 12 years in length and were not enough to reflect the complete groundwater cycle this is a relatively complete long and available dataset second the groundwater monitoring methods and frequencies varied among the groundwater wells thus leading to uncertainties in the results liu and zheng 2016 despite that manual monitoring is not as precise as automatic monitoring both approaches reflect groundwater changes the differential trends and changes in glds are the most important in groundwater research in addition the records were processed into monthly values to reduce the impact of different monitoring frequencies third uncertainties exist in the arithmetic mean method and linear trend test used in this study a random resampling approach was used to reduce the effect of these methods on the results finally whilst this study examined the causation in spatial and temporal trends in gld this study did not attempt to quantify and model the innate groundwater physics that would lead to the causation due to the lack of information about groundwater physical factors such as geological features and hydraulic parameters which control the hydraulic response throughout an aquifer and throughout time abbott et al 2019 milly et al 2014 scanlon et al 2018 shen 2018 further work is warranted to determine the more precise physical mechanisms including important geologic and hydrogeologic controls for the causality and trends noted in this analysis 5 summary and conclusion this study investigated the spatiotemporal gld changes in unconfined and confined aquifers across china from 2005 to 2016 for the first time the results showed that the glds in both unconfined and confined aquifers decreased over the energy limited region but increased over the water limited region the gld variations were mainly impacted by increased precipitation in the energy limited region and by groundwater abstraction in the water limited region the correlations between the glds and grace twsas were higher over the water limited region than over the energy limited region indicating that groundwater storage contributes more to tws over relatively arid areas than humid areas this study elucidates key trends in glds under different climatic conditions and highlights enhanced regional differences in groundwater resources i e increasing groundwater storage in humid areas and decreasing groundwater storage in arid areas the results extend the current scope of groundwater research and fill the gap in the primary large scale groundwater research in humid regions of china these improved understandings of groundwater in turn vitally underpin robust groundwater management and policy

1746,this work deepens the issue of groundwater connectivity and the behavior of permeable alluvial pathways from a thermodynamic viewpoint groundwater pathways have been inferred from geological data upon a starting dataset of 2000 mc simulations of alluvial sediment ratios each mc realization is thresholded upon a certain sediment s ratio threshold within the unit interval each ensemble of connected locations forms a subsurface pathway and the latter is fitted through a gibbs distribution gd each distribution s best fit exponent is proportional to the local entropy in a random point of the connected pathway gd s exponents decrease at the increase of the threshold prescribed for defining an alluvial pathway proving that a higher conductivity threshold enables identifying a highly efficient pathway where groundwater flow encounters less resistance tending to be more conveyed moreover more probable pathways return lower gd exponents lower gd exponents imply a lower energy dissipation within a groundwater pathway hence the latter is thermodynamically more efficient and colder than its less probable counterparts moreover most probable groundwater pathways are close to a thermodynamical equilibrium zero free energy making their spatial probable structure more ordered to energetic fluctuations in addition the estimation of gd s exponents for a randomly sampled connected pathways subset enables to highlight the fractal nature of a subsurface pathway the gd s exponent weak variation across scales underlines its role as a signature of the whole pathway as of its portions these results achieved only from geological data are important for understanding the patterns of groundwater and contaminant pathways and are strikingly consistent with the latest findings of the research in hydrological systems thermodynamics this work frames groundwater pathways delineation within a novel thermodynamic framework and reconciles their spatial behavior to that of their surface counterparts keywords groundwater pathways gibbs distribution thermodynamics connectivity fractals data availability data repository is reported within the manuscript in the dedicated section 1 introduction the spatial organization of groundwater permeable sediments is fundamental in understanding key subsurface flow and transport processes the issue of delineating highly permeable subsurface pathways see e g schiavo 2022 becomes conceptually and operatively difficult to be managed hand in hand with the high degree of aquifer facies spatial heterogeneity which is subject to multiple sources of uncertainty see e g schiavo 2023 the most recent research faces this issue by proposing some interesting results for example zehe et al 2021 underline the importance of preferential pathways detection for properly understanding groundwater transport processes while schiavo et al 2022 propose a novel framework to detect preferential groundwater flow pathways from an energetic viewpoint preferential pathways such as drainage networks for surface runoff are commonly investigated from an energetic perspective disregarding geology lithology vegetation or climate rinaldo et al 1996 this way of approaching the problem is well established and the extraction of drainage networks relying upon energetic data i e digital elevation models local elevation see deschaux and souriau 1996 stolar et al 2007 is widely known and applied within hydrological sciences e g howard 1990 and rodriguez iturbe et al 1998 groundwater problems cannot be treated in respect of their surface counterparts by neglecting the effect of geology several pieces of research were dedicated to the study of the fractal spatial organization of soil matrix fractures lu et al 2019 the relationship between fractures and soil matrix heterogeneous density and permeability fields neuman 2008 and the multifractality of soil samples guadagnini et al 2012 to geological basins weathering navarre sitchler and brantley 2007 however something misses within the present knowledge to be fully able to recombine surface and groundwater processes within a unique framework the work of berkowitz and zehe 2020 was dedicated to highlighting the common aspects shared by these two water worlds which seem to share their most intimate spatial organization patterns many research works e g rigon et al 1994 rinaldo et al 1995 rinaldo et al 1995 rinaldo et al 1996 rinaldo et al 2014 exposed how the fractal behavior of river networks spatial organization is inseparable from landscape organization and retains a precise thermodynamic signature zhou and wong 2008 however river network extraction does not take into account any aspect related to geology vegetation o r roughness rinaldo et al 1996 and this research gap in connecting these aspects must be filled a recent work proposed by schiavo 2022 frames the delineation of permeable groundwater pathways in alluvial aquifers from a novel viewpoint just relying on geological data the result returns a probabilistic delineation of preferential flow pathways hence insights about subsurface connectivity in highly heterogeneous domains the present work aims therefore to investigate this kind of groundwater pathway relying upon a dataset of monte carlo mc alluvial soil realizations this way investigating a thermodynamic system in its widest meaning was opened by numerous works with different aims and only exemplary ones will here be cited for example parker and troutman 1989 troutman and karlinger 1989 and troutman 1992 investigated surface drainage networks topology and connectivity features through stochastic drainage network realizations the energetic patterns of landscapes hence the structure of connected trees and their sub branches within a fractal system conceptualization were analyzed by zhou and wong 2008 moreover the fractal behavior and self organization of river networks were studied by rinaldo et al 1996 and rodriguez iturbe et al 1998 relying upon the experimental points underlined by leopold 1962 two points particularly come into the present discussion the first regards a boltzmann like distribution called gibbs distribution troutman and karlinger 1992 rinaldo et al 1996 kissell and poserina 2017 that can be used to express the density function of spanning connected structure the second explains that the exponent of this exponential density function regulates the thermodynamic behavior either of the entire network of each branch hence is fundamental in understanding the fractal nature of tree like networks like river branching networks see e g parker and troutman 1989 rinaldo et al 1996 zhou and wong 2008 groundwater pathways cannot be dissimilar to other forms of connected structures that are present in nature which have been proven to employ similar rules for carving networks in rivers ecosystems and pathways banavar et al 1999 therefore groundwater pathways as connected structures are places where energy dissipation processes take place along with the structure of the pathway itself rinaldo et al 1996 d odorico and rigon 2003 energy production and dissipation again can be inspected by employing proper boltzmann like relationships like the gibbs distribution this means that all the quantities describing a system d odorico and rigon 2003 like the geometry length width of a pathway as well as its energetic dissipation measures given by geological based local permeability values are precisely consistent with the need for energy dissipation through the pathway schiavo et al 2022 the second law of thermodynamic refers to physical entropy clausius 1857 which according to shannon 1948 is strongly related to pathways spatial organization the concepts about entropy influence on networks topological features or connections haven been investigated such for irreversible mixing and reaction processes and their predictability chiogna and rolle 2017 thus the entropy of a groundwater pathway can be quantified once the probabilistic assessment of the pathway itself is achieved then by employing the 6 the entropy of a pathway must be coupled with the concept of its temperature see rinaldo et al 1996 banavar et al 1999 d odorico and rigon 2003 the latter describing the local energy fluctuations within a system hence its tendency for further organizing toward saving more energy being more efficient rinaldo et al 1996 showed that the most likely surface network retains the lowest possibility of further modifications in its structure hence in its pathway because of minimizing the local flux or discharge baptista et al 2020 a connected structure s which exactly minimizes a measure of potential energy measure e j h γ s the second term is called hamiltonian and is expressed upon a boltzmann like function upon a proper exponent in rinaldo et al 1996 γ and conversely its dissipation d j h γ s see e g howard 1990 and schiavo et al 2022 has a temperature of t 0 and the lowest possible entropy hence is the most organized configuration possible for the connected structure energy power production in groundwater pathways as well as in rivers see leopold and langbein 1962 howard 1990 is proportional to the local discharge conveyed within the pathway this is reasonable if one thinks to discharge as darcian velocity times the wetted area the former one given by a dissipation quantity conductivity multiplied by a driving gradient see berkowitz and zehe 2020 schiavo et al 2022 the higher the discharge through a pathway the higher is the need for local energy dissipation under this light leopold and langbein 1962 quantities involved in energy production or dissipation processes like conductivity hydraulic gradient width water depth groundwater discharge potential energy and entropy must be considered all together within the same thermodynamic framework moreover zehe et al 2019 discussed how a hydrological system always does its best to fulfill the second principle of thermodynamics by tending to a zero free state energy hence the most efficient possible spatial configuration at each time of analysis the goal of the present work is to assess if a precise signature of groundwater geological inferred pathways here investigated under a completely novel light can be identified within the framework of gds like the well acknowledged one proposed for connected surface structures e g troutman and karlinger 1992 rinaldo et al 1996 and if it may teach something about how groundwater preferential pathways are organized and how to be interpreted from a thermodynamic perspective this way gds are applied to each realization of a monte carlo mc ensemble of alluvial soil ratios this work grounds on the dataset outcome from the work published by schiavo 2022 see data sources section for availability and is organized as follows the methodology section illustrates the general framework of how to treat alluvial soil ratios delineate alluvial pathways and apply a gibbs distribution either for each mc inferred alluvial pathway and within the probability space the results section illustrates the achieved results in detail reporting gibbs distribution exponents estimated for groundwater pathways for both realizations and within the probability space the discussion section frames the present results within a thermodynamic and energetic framework connecting themselves with the available literature in the end the conclusions section summarizes major novelty and research impacting points 2 methodology let an investigation domain be considered and discretized into i 1 n regularly gridded cells identified by their coordinates x i x i y i each i th domain location is embedded by a simulated ratio of permeable sediments within the unit interval upon which a connected pathway can be delineated for each mc simulation the detailed procedure for delineating groundwater pathways can be found in schiavo 2022 here is itemized in the following steps each one referring to a different fig 1 s panel a borehole depth averaged lithological data are divided into alluvial permeable and non alluvial fine poorly permeable sediments by taking the most prevalent one along bore s depth b the binary variable embedding each bore s lithological characterization i e prevalent alluvial facies or not is modeled as a random variable upon a proper variographic analysis c this is repeated for a sufficient number of monte carlo mc realizations in number to be defined as described at the end of this section d a first threshold on alluvial sediments ratio is chosen to consider as vehiculating groundwater flow only locations embedded by a value of alluvial ratio higher than the threshold itself for each mc realization of the ensemble each simulation s locations where the local value of permeable sediments exceeds the fixed threshold are considered as alluvial and vice versa as not alluvial e a second probabilistic threshold is taken after having treated each over threshold local alluvial ratio as an indicator variable ruled by a bernoulli like distribution which is related to the local probability of having a groundwater pathway f the point e can be explained by introducing an indicator variable as follows for the local simulated alluvial ratio of sediment 1 i s x i 1 i f r s x i t h r 0 i f r s x i t h r w i t h r 1 s s 1 s being each mc realization r s x i the local simulated permeable sediments ratio at the i th cell the s th realization and i s x i is the value of i x i in realization s of the mc ensemble then χ x i was computed as 2 χ x i 1 s s 1 s i s x i q s q an integer between 1 and s being the number of mc simulations where the indicator is equal to one at the i th location as well as done in schiavo et al 2023 therefore the indicator i x i is a random variable that follows a bernoulli distribution johnson et al 1993 bertsekas 2002 with probability χ x i given by p i x i 1 χ x i of the local aquifer s soil being mostly alluvial then histogram informing about the total density of alluvial locations for each mc realization g upon a proper threshold thr on alluvial ratio is achieved h which must be fitted through a gibbs distribution for each realization returning an exponent β and across realizations exponents β to return an exponent ρ in the probability space j each alluvial location s ensemble i s i s x i becomes a vector of logical values 0 or 1 which can be fitted upon the following distribution 3 p r i t h r 1 r i t h r 1 β in the present context of hydrological and geological sciences as well as in many applications within these fields see the introduction section and references therein a gibb s distribution gd see e g kissell and poserina 2017 is a well known density function usually employed to describe connected structures like in the case of drainage tree like networks and may preferred to the 3 being a one parameter curve type a gd of values of the logical variable 1 can be written as follows 4 p r i t h r β exp β r i exp β r i in this application r i r x i the local i th permeable sediments ratio which may exceed a prescribed threshold thr or not according to the 1 and β is a proper fitting exponent of the exponential like cumulative distribution itself and p r i t h r the probability of having a local alluvial ratio r i upon a threshold thr on the simaulated alluvial ratio the latter exponent varies upon the threshold on the whole realization simulated ratios hence for s mc simulations and t threshold thr values one comes up with e s t possible β exponents to be employed within the 4 furthermore if the probability χ x i of a location being embedded by a permeable sediments ratio higher than a threshold is considered it can be expressed through a gd too in the probability space 5 p χ i p ρ exp ρ χ i p exp ρ χ i p being χ i χ x i p the probability between 0 and 1 that the local i th permeable sediments ratio r i which exceeds thr or not hence is a logical value exceeds a probability p and ρ is a proper fitting exponent of the exponential like cumulative distribution itself for each threshold thr each domain location becomes embedded with one value of χ x i as the mean across possible ratios r i for each employed probability threshold p one comes up with one possible ρ exponent fitting the whole pathway s probabilities of exceeding a probability threshold p for each realization of a groundwater pathway following the approach exposed in leopold and langbein 1962 the local entropy can be assessed using the probability threshold employed within eq 5 hence delimiting the area with a minimum probability of residing on a groundwater alluvial pathway as follows 6 ϕ i ϕ x i d h i t log χ x j where stemming from the second principle of thermodynamics given a local total energy dissipation h i the absolute water table level for phreatic aquifers for a system at the temperature t ϕ i is the local entropy to be calculated for a specific alluvial pathway the latter delineated upon a minimum permeable sediment threshold thr and a probability one p χ x j is the probability of a location j of being part of such a pathway the last term of the 6 basically interprets the adverse probability of having a pathway in an i th location of the space thus the local steady entropy state of a groundwater pathway is proportional to the local energy dissipation a proper number of mc realizations can be defined by inspecting the progressive statistical moments e g mean and variance across the realizations which must reach a steady value details not shown gibbs distributions or boltzmann like distributions employed to describe the spatial structure of surface networks enable to highlight the relationship between the temperature of a network rinaldo et al 1996 banavar et al 1999 zehe et al 2019 and its spatial structure within the present context temperature implies an energy availability in a certain point of the network and subsequently the possibility of its dissipation through a proper resistance i e the local conductivity value baptista et al 2020 potential energy conductivity and entropy are quantities related to the same exponential function 4 which is generally employed in thermodynamics to represent the temperature as a control variable this implies that employing the 4 with its original meaning leads to 7 p r i t h r exp β r i exp h i t implying that for the system temperature t k a gibbs distribution enables assessing that more probable pathways where the local energy is likely higher than that found where the probability of finding a connected permeable pathway is lower are colder than lower probable ones at the end the equality between the last member of the 7 and its counterpart within the 6 must be underlined 3 results 3 1 statistics of groundwater pathways the starting dataset see data source section is composed of 2000 mc simulations of alluvial sediment ratios resembling the ratio of permeable geomaterials in an alluvial aquifer located within the province of lecco lombardy northern italy see fig 1 geomaterials and stratigraphic domain characterization is available upon i borehole data which for ease of representation are depicted in fig 1 colored upon the prevalent lithologic group across surficial aquifer s thickness and ii some hydrogeological sections see schiavo et al 2022 here not shown the hydrogeological setting of the domain retains a clear alluvial and fluvioglacial origin with tongues of permeable sediments conveyed in the proximity of surface river bodies such as alluvial fans more details in cavallin et al 1983 schiavo et al 2022 schiavo 2022 and with a larger scale of inspection in fontana et al 2014 a collection of s 2000 mc realizations of bi dimensional depth averaged alluvial soil ratios see schiavo 2022 and references therein have been obtained from a sequential gaussian simulations ensemble sgsim see deutsch and journel 1997 and 100 threshold values from thr 0 01 to 1 0 are chosen as well as p 0 01 1 0 probability thresholds each mc realization is thresholded a different threshold upon different alluvial sediments ratios as the following fig 2 illustrates for several exemplary realizations each mc realization s distribution values are then fitted through a proper exponent according to the 4 the following fig 3 reports an exemplary realization of alluvial soil ratios panel a being fitted upon a maximum likelihood estimated ml details not shown β exponent panel b while panel c wraps up all s 2000 fitted exponents for two exemplary thresholds once each mc realization has been thresholded upon 100 threshold values from 0 to 1 and best fitting β exponents are achieved the latter e ones are collected across realizations and their values are examined upon each fixed threshold the result of this step is illustrated in fig 4 panel a clearly showing how the exponent β non linearly decreases as the threshold employed to delineate each realization s alluvial locations collection increases this is true for both median minimum and maximum β values as underlined in schiavo 2022 the most relevant threshold values on alluvial ratios to be considered for retrieving alluvial pathways consistent with available piezometric and hydrogeological information are between 0 50 and 0 90 although the whole range of exponents here presented is worthy of being analyzed the higher the employed alluvial threshold the narrower the alluvial pathway that can be delineated across the domain like in fig 2 s panels furthermore the mean across thresholded alluvial ratios ρ the local probability χ x i of having a pathway exceeding a minimum alluvial threshold return as many exponents as many are the employed thresholds applied to the variable χ x i see schiavo 2022 again the exponent ρ decreases hand in hand with the increase of the threshold employed to affect all the mc simulations employed to achieve the local probability values values of β exponents depicted in fig 4 s panel a show a spanning range that decreases as the increase of thresholds moreover if a gd like expression can be employed to model fig 4 s panel b for example for probability spatial distributions obtained for threshold values between 0 10 and 0 90 the latter interval returns an exponent value of 0 32 0 30 for the whole ρ exponents range proving that the distribution of probability s exponents ρ can be themselves interpreted via gd the value of the β exponent and in the same way for ρ can be further investigated at various spatial inspection scales the values reported in fig 4 panel a have been obtained for s 2000 mc realizations of subsurface structures by taking all the locations fulfilling the condition of being regarded as mostly alluvial now a further synthetic numerical experiment is done by taking m 1000 subsets of different lengths ranges between 2 and 77 500 cells of each s th mc realization then each alluvial connected substructure is fitted through a gd 4 as done earlier in this paper the result for one exemplary mc alluvial soil realization and spanning all possible thresholds from 0 01 to 1 of alluvial soil ratio is reported in fig 5 for a reasonable threshold interval 0 1 0 9 fig 4 s panel c illustrates exponents across m randomly taken subsets i e connected pathways of various lengths for each threshold the result is strikingly similar to panel a s one at least for median values this aspect is underlined via fig 4 s panel d where the overall gd exponent across thresholds is fitted for randomly taken subsets blue line or for all locations of one mc realization exceeding a varying alluvial threshold the result of the overall fitting procedure via gd returns exponent values of 0 329 blue line subsets and 0 318 orange line which are very close to each other this means that the behavior of a gd s exponent β is scale free hence fractal rinaldo et al 1996 rodriguez iturbe et al 1998 since its dependence on the size of the sample of alluvial connected locations is incredibly poor similar results can of course be obtained by employing all the other mc realizations with a barely perceptible variation in the gd s exponent in any case between 0 31 and 0 34 of the distribution across thresholds 3 2 entropy of groundwater pathways entropy states are calculated for the last case study upon using various probability thresholds on χ x i the following fig 5 illustrates some panels along two exemplary transects panel a and f local entropy values are offered in panels d and i being calculated upon eq 6 and they decrease with the increase of the employed probability threshold imposed on χ x i for delineating a pathway this non linear relationship between the probability and the local entropy state thus the local energy dissipation is embedded within the 6 at a local scale fig 5 s panels b and g depict locations where the probability χ of finding a pathway upon an alluvial threshold of 0 50 is the highest and at these locations the local entropy fluctuations and energetic dissipation ones are the highest too groundwater pathways with a modest 0 50 occurrence probability are still quite disordered hence retaining high entropy values as well as spanning wide ranges of conductivities between nearby locations indeed locations embedded with high probability values are also those where entropy ones are negligible see panels b d and g i for the two exemplary transects nevertheless a full domain scale inspection reveals that the higher the employed threshold thr for delineating a pathway the closer the system to the zero free energy i e the average entropy is closer to zero with varying alluvial ratio thresholds the system might assume certain configurations hence pathways with the proper width permeability and occurrence probability χ to maximize energy dissipation lowering the local entropy to be as close as possible to the thermodynamic equilibrium rodriguez iturbe et al 1998 zehe et al 2019 in other words each groundwater system tends to reach the best possible energetic configuration these statements are fundamental to understanding the behavior of a groundwater system as a thermodynamic one moreover median entropy values too at a full scale are around zero meaning that ordered and disordered parts of a groundwater pathway are in a sort of balance at a wider inspection scale these findings exactly overlap the concept of zero free energy as a thermodynamic equilibrium point of a streamflow generation system discussed by zehe et al 2019 fig 6 s panels enable to deepen these findings and understand more about the thermodynamic behavior of a groundwater system upon varying delineating minimum probabilities panels a and c illustrate a hydrogeological section a a see fig 1 panel a where highly permeable aquifer bodies are highlighted by red dashed boxes panels b and d illustrates pathways probability and entropy via boxplots respectively while panel e is employed for appraising groundwater discharges quantified along section a a for details about groundwater discharges quantification see schiavo 2023 four types of pathways are investigated panels a and c as those delineated through minimum probabilistic thresholds of 0 50 purple line 0 75 yellow line 0 90 red line and 0 95 blue line as well as in schiavo 2022 as well as previously stated the highest permeable locations are those which are embedded by the highest probability of having a groundwater pathway by construction moreover highly permeable pathways are those with the lowest entropy values and with an energetic state closer to the zero free energy proposed by zehe et al 2019 hence more probable pathways are more energetically efficient and spatially ordered the spatial order comes from high probability values χ of having a pathway in a certain location and the energetic efficiency is confirmed by the alluvial nature of soils where local fluxes find less resistance being the path more conductive see baptista et al 2020 and high discharges tend to be conveyed this is confirmed by panel e s discharges which are generally higher where pathways are more permeable hence the soil is more conductive and therefore the probability of a highly permeable pathway is high and entropy magnitude tends to be negligible furthermore while highly permeable pathways see e g that delineated upon thr 0 95 are very close to being optimal since their overall entropy is close to zero on average see first boxplot in panel d less permeable ones are farther from a thermodynamic equilibrium the lower is the minimum alluvial soil threshold they are delineated with clayey silty or rocky parts of an aquifer body are those where conveyed discharges are low energy dissipation is high due to low conductivity and high local resistivity to groundwater flow hence entropy is high and the flow conduits may be highly disordered 4 discussion these results need to be discussed in several points first it is significant that geologically inferred preferential pathways within groundwater domains behave in the same way as river networks see e g troutman and karlinger 1992 and rinaldo et al 1996 hence their distribution can be appraised through fitting a gd this point is important for improving the current knowledge of driving similar but different hydrological processes in this case surface and groundwater flow pathways within a common phenomenon interpreting distribution the core result of the present work is the behavior of β and ρ exponent upon varying alluvial ratio thresholds and their framing within an energetic framework the higher the alluvial threshold the higher is the minimum alluvial ratio required for considering a depth averaged aquifer location as mostly alluvial hence being able to be crossed by a preferential pathway within the surficial aquifer the higher the threshold the lower the groundwater flow s minimum resistance within an alluvial aquifer location hence groundwater flow is likely to be conveyed where flow resistance is lower and the flux variable i e groundwater discharge is higher than elsewhere see e g baptista et al 2020 and schiavo 2022 the β and ρ exponents here presented retained a precise energetic signature as well as briefly reminded in the introduction of this work drainage networks are likely to be energetically described by a gd or a bolzmann like density function rinaldo et al 1996 the exponent of the cumulative distribution describing a tree shaped connected structure i e p s exp h γ s t regardless of gibbs parameter t is called hamiltonian and depicts the energetic state of the system rinaldo et al 1996 proved that for certain connected structure s the lower the values h γ s the lower the energy e j h γ s retained by the system and conversely its dissipation d j h γ s see e g howard 1990 schiavo et al 2022 that must locally respect an energy balance this comparison is fundamental to understanding the position of the present work since higher thresholds upon alluvial ratios return lower β exponents and narrower pathways the energy resistance d j that the flow encounters through them is lower than that one may obtain for higher exponents thus employing lower alluvial thresholds moreover higher ρ thresholds employed within the 5 return more probable pathways upon a previously fixed threshold thr flow resistance is lower too than is less probable pathways furthermore higher alluvial thresholds thr return more conductive hence less resistive flow pathways through the local aquifer body if the energy dissipation is framed as a kinetic variable d v m where v m s is local planar flow velocity and m a real exponent usually m 2 higher thresholds return lower energy dissipation along the pathway hence a colder one while wider pathways are described by higher gd s exponents and are locally more dissipative the same can be assessed for higher probable pathways inferred via higher p probability thresholds which are more likely to be delineated in locations where groundwater flow dissipates less energy and hence is more conveyed the higher the entropy the hotter the less conveyed and hence the wider and more dispersed is the flow pathway and it can be univocally described upon a gd 4 thus through its exponent β or the 5 hence upon exponent p if working in the probability space the spatial organization s stability of preferential pathways within the subsurface is resembled by their local occurrence probability χ x i which is higher for highly probable pathways where the groundwater body s conductivity is higher hence the flow is more conveyed and the average width is narrower than elsewhere across the domain groundwater connected pathways sharing a minimum alluvial soil ratio are fractals since their connectivity attribute is scale independent this can be achieved by fitting β exponents of a gd obtained by taking randomly sized samples of a connected pathway like the one referring to one mc realization of alluvial soil values exponents β across all possible thresholds are extremely weakly dependent on the size of the sample under investigation i e on the portion of the connected pathway to be fitted through a gd these last results fully reconcile the connectivity of geologically inferred subsurface pathways with previous literature about the fractality of self organized drainage networks see e g rigon et al 1994 and rinaldo et al 1995 in the end the variability of the exponent β across randomly taken pathways portions decreases with the increase of the employed alluvial threshold this implies that even slightly varying values of β may be appraised for different lengths of an alluvial pathway this range decreases with the temperature see rinaldo et al 1996 of the connected structure hence a cold subsurface pathway retains a limited spatial variability complementary as said with a high local probability that flow resides in a location a high degree of local order due to negative entropy values or close to zero as consequences of poorly varying gd exponents the temperature of a groundwater system rinaldo et al 1996 is directly dependent on its spatial structure highly probable groundwater pathways are significantly colder than those delineated upon lower probabilities the reason for that can be achieved by thinking that energy variations induced by a groundwater system alter its local energy values in other words its total local energy a system poorly sensitive to energy variations i e a pathway carved upon a very high probabilistic threshold p across equiprobable mc simulations is colder than another carved upon lower probabilistic requirements this means that gd exponents fully explain the order of the pathway hence its closeness or farness from a zero free energy thermodynamic point zehe et al 2019 this appears particularly interesting for transport problems at least for advective non reactive ones which may be considered disregarding geo chemical interactions and processes as underlined by zehe et al 2019 and zehe et al 2021 preferential flow self organization entropy work and contaminant transport are intimately related thus understanding one of these processes helps in understanding the others the findings in the present work state that highly probable pathways are those which are likely to be very permeable hence likely to convey high discharges moreover to be less resistive conduits with low temperature due to this larger energetic inertia the fluid and solutes are likely to be located within these pathways to meet the order in the flow path distribution as reflected in lower entropies then delineating most probable groundwater pathways would play a decisive role in understanding contaminants fate at least at a large scale which may subsequently vary according to particular boundary conditions or geo chemical ones low entropy values are proven to be likely where the probability of having a highly conductive pathway is high hence discharge tends to be more conveyed due to the porous medium s lower resistivity permeability for example in sandy or gravely aquifers on the contrary high entropy values can be assessed where permeabilities are low like in clayey or rocky soils and the flow tends to be less ordered hence retains less energetic efficiency and is more disperse see baptista et al 2020 thus retrieving gd s exponents for surrogating energy entropy signatures free energy and entropy is a novelty for geologically inferred groundwater pathways placing these findings in the context of the most advanced research within this field 5 conclusions the present work s major results can be summarized as follows preferential groundwater pathways achieved from solely geological data can be delineated upon an alluvial soil threshold thr and within the probability space upon a p one for each realization of an mc ensemble continuous alluvial locations can be fitted upon a gibbs distribution which has already been employed as a proper density function to describe connected structures such as surface drainage networks the fitting exponents β and ρ decrease at the increase of the alluvial threshold employed to delineate a groundwater pathway and their ml estimated range of variation higher exponents return both narrower and more probable connected structures then energy production and dissipation are lower there than elsewhere as resembled by lower exponents values which are proportional to the local system s energy as in the case of surface networks moreover higher conductive or probable connected pathways are colder than their lower probable counterparts because more stable to energy fluctuations than wider less conductive hence more resisting low conveying and thermodynamically hotter pathways where energy dissipation hence entropy is higher in the end gibbs distribution seems a proper choice to describe groundwater preferential pathways being employed to describe the intimate relationship between sediments spatial organization and energy production and dissipation along a groundwater pathway moreover the fractal and scale independent nature of alluvial pathways reconciles this viewpoint with the literature referring to energy based connected structures like optimal channel networks e g rinaldo et al 1996 and more in general surface drainage networks this is particularly interesting aiming to frame different phenomena or ways of assessing the physical reality regarding subsurface pathways features within a unique conceptual hence mathematical framework these results have been achieved starting from a geological set up and this represents a significant novelty in respect of the viewpoint drainage networks are framed their framing within the present scientific knowledge is strikingly consistent and complementary with available literature and theoretical energy related flow conceptualization achieved so far e g rinaldo et al 1996 about the thermodynamic framework zehe et al 2019 2021 and schiavo et al 2022 for the spatial organization of connected structures and baptista et al 2020 for the minimum energy dissipation within the most conductive conduits furthermore this work demonstrates upon a real data application that a groundwater system reaches a quasi thermodynamic equilibrium condition where the probability of having a highly permeable pathway is very high this work contributes to the scientific community by presenting a perspective from which geologically inferred connected structures can be framed within the same framework of surface drainage networks and may be usefully investigated toward a deeper appraisal of groundwater flow in complex systems a final remark is devoted to underlining how understanding groundwater systems and natural ones in a wider sense enables us to closely acknowledge the beauty of nature where nothing is random and what seems so is just highly organized and carefully dependent on phenomenological laws similar between different phenomena

1746,this work deepens the issue of groundwater connectivity and the behavior of permeable alluvial pathways from a thermodynamic viewpoint groundwater pathways have been inferred from geological data upon a starting dataset of 2000 mc simulations of alluvial sediment ratios each mc realization is thresholded upon a certain sediment s ratio threshold within the unit interval each ensemble of connected locations forms a subsurface pathway and the latter is fitted through a gibbs distribution gd each distribution s best fit exponent is proportional to the local entropy in a random point of the connected pathway gd s exponents decrease at the increase of the threshold prescribed for defining an alluvial pathway proving that a higher conductivity threshold enables identifying a highly efficient pathway where groundwater flow encounters less resistance tending to be more conveyed moreover more probable pathways return lower gd exponents lower gd exponents imply a lower energy dissipation within a groundwater pathway hence the latter is thermodynamically more efficient and colder than its less probable counterparts moreover most probable groundwater pathways are close to a thermodynamical equilibrium zero free energy making their spatial probable structure more ordered to energetic fluctuations in addition the estimation of gd s exponents for a randomly sampled connected pathways subset enables to highlight the fractal nature of a subsurface pathway the gd s exponent weak variation across scales underlines its role as a signature of the whole pathway as of its portions these results achieved only from geological data are important for understanding the patterns of groundwater and contaminant pathways and are strikingly consistent with the latest findings of the research in hydrological systems thermodynamics this work frames groundwater pathways delineation within a novel thermodynamic framework and reconciles their spatial behavior to that of their surface counterparts keywords groundwater pathways gibbs distribution thermodynamics connectivity fractals data availability data repository is reported within the manuscript in the dedicated section 1 introduction the spatial organization of groundwater permeable sediments is fundamental in understanding key subsurface flow and transport processes the issue of delineating highly permeable subsurface pathways see e g schiavo 2022 becomes conceptually and operatively difficult to be managed hand in hand with the high degree of aquifer facies spatial heterogeneity which is subject to multiple sources of uncertainty see e g schiavo 2023 the most recent research faces this issue by proposing some interesting results for example zehe et al 2021 underline the importance of preferential pathways detection for properly understanding groundwater transport processes while schiavo et al 2022 propose a novel framework to detect preferential groundwater flow pathways from an energetic viewpoint preferential pathways such as drainage networks for surface runoff are commonly investigated from an energetic perspective disregarding geology lithology vegetation or climate rinaldo et al 1996 this way of approaching the problem is well established and the extraction of drainage networks relying upon energetic data i e digital elevation models local elevation see deschaux and souriau 1996 stolar et al 2007 is widely known and applied within hydrological sciences e g howard 1990 and rodriguez iturbe et al 1998 groundwater problems cannot be treated in respect of their surface counterparts by neglecting the effect of geology several pieces of research were dedicated to the study of the fractal spatial organization of soil matrix fractures lu et al 2019 the relationship between fractures and soil matrix heterogeneous density and permeability fields neuman 2008 and the multifractality of soil samples guadagnini et al 2012 to geological basins weathering navarre sitchler and brantley 2007 however something misses within the present knowledge to be fully able to recombine surface and groundwater processes within a unique framework the work of berkowitz and zehe 2020 was dedicated to highlighting the common aspects shared by these two water worlds which seem to share their most intimate spatial organization patterns many research works e g rigon et al 1994 rinaldo et al 1995 rinaldo et al 1995 rinaldo et al 1996 rinaldo et al 2014 exposed how the fractal behavior of river networks spatial organization is inseparable from landscape organization and retains a precise thermodynamic signature zhou and wong 2008 however river network extraction does not take into account any aspect related to geology vegetation o r roughness rinaldo et al 1996 and this research gap in connecting these aspects must be filled a recent work proposed by schiavo 2022 frames the delineation of permeable groundwater pathways in alluvial aquifers from a novel viewpoint just relying on geological data the result returns a probabilistic delineation of preferential flow pathways hence insights about subsurface connectivity in highly heterogeneous domains the present work aims therefore to investigate this kind of groundwater pathway relying upon a dataset of monte carlo mc alluvial soil realizations this way investigating a thermodynamic system in its widest meaning was opened by numerous works with different aims and only exemplary ones will here be cited for example parker and troutman 1989 troutman and karlinger 1989 and troutman 1992 investigated surface drainage networks topology and connectivity features through stochastic drainage network realizations the energetic patterns of landscapes hence the structure of connected trees and their sub branches within a fractal system conceptualization were analyzed by zhou and wong 2008 moreover the fractal behavior and self organization of river networks were studied by rinaldo et al 1996 and rodriguez iturbe et al 1998 relying upon the experimental points underlined by leopold 1962 two points particularly come into the present discussion the first regards a boltzmann like distribution called gibbs distribution troutman and karlinger 1992 rinaldo et al 1996 kissell and poserina 2017 that can be used to express the density function of spanning connected structure the second explains that the exponent of this exponential density function regulates the thermodynamic behavior either of the entire network of each branch hence is fundamental in understanding the fractal nature of tree like networks like river branching networks see e g parker and troutman 1989 rinaldo et al 1996 zhou and wong 2008 groundwater pathways cannot be dissimilar to other forms of connected structures that are present in nature which have been proven to employ similar rules for carving networks in rivers ecosystems and pathways banavar et al 1999 therefore groundwater pathways as connected structures are places where energy dissipation processes take place along with the structure of the pathway itself rinaldo et al 1996 d odorico and rigon 2003 energy production and dissipation again can be inspected by employing proper boltzmann like relationships like the gibbs distribution this means that all the quantities describing a system d odorico and rigon 2003 like the geometry length width of a pathway as well as its energetic dissipation measures given by geological based local permeability values are precisely consistent with the need for energy dissipation through the pathway schiavo et al 2022 the second law of thermodynamic refers to physical entropy clausius 1857 which according to shannon 1948 is strongly related to pathways spatial organization the concepts about entropy influence on networks topological features or connections haven been investigated such for irreversible mixing and reaction processes and their predictability chiogna and rolle 2017 thus the entropy of a groundwater pathway can be quantified once the probabilistic assessment of the pathway itself is achieved then by employing the 6 the entropy of a pathway must be coupled with the concept of its temperature see rinaldo et al 1996 banavar et al 1999 d odorico and rigon 2003 the latter describing the local energy fluctuations within a system hence its tendency for further organizing toward saving more energy being more efficient rinaldo et al 1996 showed that the most likely surface network retains the lowest possibility of further modifications in its structure hence in its pathway because of minimizing the local flux or discharge baptista et al 2020 a connected structure s which exactly minimizes a measure of potential energy measure e j h γ s the second term is called hamiltonian and is expressed upon a boltzmann like function upon a proper exponent in rinaldo et al 1996 γ and conversely its dissipation d j h γ s see e g howard 1990 and schiavo et al 2022 has a temperature of t 0 and the lowest possible entropy hence is the most organized configuration possible for the connected structure energy power production in groundwater pathways as well as in rivers see leopold and langbein 1962 howard 1990 is proportional to the local discharge conveyed within the pathway this is reasonable if one thinks to discharge as darcian velocity times the wetted area the former one given by a dissipation quantity conductivity multiplied by a driving gradient see berkowitz and zehe 2020 schiavo et al 2022 the higher the discharge through a pathway the higher is the need for local energy dissipation under this light leopold and langbein 1962 quantities involved in energy production or dissipation processes like conductivity hydraulic gradient width water depth groundwater discharge potential energy and entropy must be considered all together within the same thermodynamic framework moreover zehe et al 2019 discussed how a hydrological system always does its best to fulfill the second principle of thermodynamics by tending to a zero free state energy hence the most efficient possible spatial configuration at each time of analysis the goal of the present work is to assess if a precise signature of groundwater geological inferred pathways here investigated under a completely novel light can be identified within the framework of gds like the well acknowledged one proposed for connected surface structures e g troutman and karlinger 1992 rinaldo et al 1996 and if it may teach something about how groundwater preferential pathways are organized and how to be interpreted from a thermodynamic perspective this way gds are applied to each realization of a monte carlo mc ensemble of alluvial soil ratios this work grounds on the dataset outcome from the work published by schiavo 2022 see data sources section for availability and is organized as follows the methodology section illustrates the general framework of how to treat alluvial soil ratios delineate alluvial pathways and apply a gibbs distribution either for each mc inferred alluvial pathway and within the probability space the results section illustrates the achieved results in detail reporting gibbs distribution exponents estimated for groundwater pathways for both realizations and within the probability space the discussion section frames the present results within a thermodynamic and energetic framework connecting themselves with the available literature in the end the conclusions section summarizes major novelty and research impacting points 2 methodology let an investigation domain be considered and discretized into i 1 n regularly gridded cells identified by their coordinates x i x i y i each i th domain location is embedded by a simulated ratio of permeable sediments within the unit interval upon which a connected pathway can be delineated for each mc simulation the detailed procedure for delineating groundwater pathways can be found in schiavo 2022 here is itemized in the following steps each one referring to a different fig 1 s panel a borehole depth averaged lithological data are divided into alluvial permeable and non alluvial fine poorly permeable sediments by taking the most prevalent one along bore s depth b the binary variable embedding each bore s lithological characterization i e prevalent alluvial facies or not is modeled as a random variable upon a proper variographic analysis c this is repeated for a sufficient number of monte carlo mc realizations in number to be defined as described at the end of this section d a first threshold on alluvial sediments ratio is chosen to consider as vehiculating groundwater flow only locations embedded by a value of alluvial ratio higher than the threshold itself for each mc realization of the ensemble each simulation s locations where the local value of permeable sediments exceeds the fixed threshold are considered as alluvial and vice versa as not alluvial e a second probabilistic threshold is taken after having treated each over threshold local alluvial ratio as an indicator variable ruled by a bernoulli like distribution which is related to the local probability of having a groundwater pathway f the point e can be explained by introducing an indicator variable as follows for the local simulated alluvial ratio of sediment 1 i s x i 1 i f r s x i t h r 0 i f r s x i t h r w i t h r 1 s s 1 s being each mc realization r s x i the local simulated permeable sediments ratio at the i th cell the s th realization and i s x i is the value of i x i in realization s of the mc ensemble then χ x i was computed as 2 χ x i 1 s s 1 s i s x i q s q an integer between 1 and s being the number of mc simulations where the indicator is equal to one at the i th location as well as done in schiavo et al 2023 therefore the indicator i x i is a random variable that follows a bernoulli distribution johnson et al 1993 bertsekas 2002 with probability χ x i given by p i x i 1 χ x i of the local aquifer s soil being mostly alluvial then histogram informing about the total density of alluvial locations for each mc realization g upon a proper threshold thr on alluvial ratio is achieved h which must be fitted through a gibbs distribution for each realization returning an exponent β and across realizations exponents β to return an exponent ρ in the probability space j each alluvial location s ensemble i s i s x i becomes a vector of logical values 0 or 1 which can be fitted upon the following distribution 3 p r i t h r 1 r i t h r 1 β in the present context of hydrological and geological sciences as well as in many applications within these fields see the introduction section and references therein a gibb s distribution gd see e g kissell and poserina 2017 is a well known density function usually employed to describe connected structures like in the case of drainage tree like networks and may preferred to the 3 being a one parameter curve type a gd of values of the logical variable 1 can be written as follows 4 p r i t h r β exp β r i exp β r i in this application r i r x i the local i th permeable sediments ratio which may exceed a prescribed threshold thr or not according to the 1 and β is a proper fitting exponent of the exponential like cumulative distribution itself and p r i t h r the probability of having a local alluvial ratio r i upon a threshold thr on the simaulated alluvial ratio the latter exponent varies upon the threshold on the whole realization simulated ratios hence for s mc simulations and t threshold thr values one comes up with e s t possible β exponents to be employed within the 4 furthermore if the probability χ x i of a location being embedded by a permeable sediments ratio higher than a threshold is considered it can be expressed through a gd too in the probability space 5 p χ i p ρ exp ρ χ i p exp ρ χ i p being χ i χ x i p the probability between 0 and 1 that the local i th permeable sediments ratio r i which exceeds thr or not hence is a logical value exceeds a probability p and ρ is a proper fitting exponent of the exponential like cumulative distribution itself for each threshold thr each domain location becomes embedded with one value of χ x i as the mean across possible ratios r i for each employed probability threshold p one comes up with one possible ρ exponent fitting the whole pathway s probabilities of exceeding a probability threshold p for each realization of a groundwater pathway following the approach exposed in leopold and langbein 1962 the local entropy can be assessed using the probability threshold employed within eq 5 hence delimiting the area with a minimum probability of residing on a groundwater alluvial pathway as follows 6 ϕ i ϕ x i d h i t log χ x j where stemming from the second principle of thermodynamics given a local total energy dissipation h i the absolute water table level for phreatic aquifers for a system at the temperature t ϕ i is the local entropy to be calculated for a specific alluvial pathway the latter delineated upon a minimum permeable sediment threshold thr and a probability one p χ x j is the probability of a location j of being part of such a pathway the last term of the 6 basically interprets the adverse probability of having a pathway in an i th location of the space thus the local steady entropy state of a groundwater pathway is proportional to the local energy dissipation a proper number of mc realizations can be defined by inspecting the progressive statistical moments e g mean and variance across the realizations which must reach a steady value details not shown gibbs distributions or boltzmann like distributions employed to describe the spatial structure of surface networks enable to highlight the relationship between the temperature of a network rinaldo et al 1996 banavar et al 1999 zehe et al 2019 and its spatial structure within the present context temperature implies an energy availability in a certain point of the network and subsequently the possibility of its dissipation through a proper resistance i e the local conductivity value baptista et al 2020 potential energy conductivity and entropy are quantities related to the same exponential function 4 which is generally employed in thermodynamics to represent the temperature as a control variable this implies that employing the 4 with its original meaning leads to 7 p r i t h r exp β r i exp h i t implying that for the system temperature t k a gibbs distribution enables assessing that more probable pathways where the local energy is likely higher than that found where the probability of finding a connected permeable pathway is lower are colder than lower probable ones at the end the equality between the last member of the 7 and its counterpart within the 6 must be underlined 3 results 3 1 statistics of groundwater pathways the starting dataset see data source section is composed of 2000 mc simulations of alluvial sediment ratios resembling the ratio of permeable geomaterials in an alluvial aquifer located within the province of lecco lombardy northern italy see fig 1 geomaterials and stratigraphic domain characterization is available upon i borehole data which for ease of representation are depicted in fig 1 colored upon the prevalent lithologic group across surficial aquifer s thickness and ii some hydrogeological sections see schiavo et al 2022 here not shown the hydrogeological setting of the domain retains a clear alluvial and fluvioglacial origin with tongues of permeable sediments conveyed in the proximity of surface river bodies such as alluvial fans more details in cavallin et al 1983 schiavo et al 2022 schiavo 2022 and with a larger scale of inspection in fontana et al 2014 a collection of s 2000 mc realizations of bi dimensional depth averaged alluvial soil ratios see schiavo 2022 and references therein have been obtained from a sequential gaussian simulations ensemble sgsim see deutsch and journel 1997 and 100 threshold values from thr 0 01 to 1 0 are chosen as well as p 0 01 1 0 probability thresholds each mc realization is thresholded a different threshold upon different alluvial sediments ratios as the following fig 2 illustrates for several exemplary realizations each mc realization s distribution values are then fitted through a proper exponent according to the 4 the following fig 3 reports an exemplary realization of alluvial soil ratios panel a being fitted upon a maximum likelihood estimated ml details not shown β exponent panel b while panel c wraps up all s 2000 fitted exponents for two exemplary thresholds once each mc realization has been thresholded upon 100 threshold values from 0 to 1 and best fitting β exponents are achieved the latter e ones are collected across realizations and their values are examined upon each fixed threshold the result of this step is illustrated in fig 4 panel a clearly showing how the exponent β non linearly decreases as the threshold employed to delineate each realization s alluvial locations collection increases this is true for both median minimum and maximum β values as underlined in schiavo 2022 the most relevant threshold values on alluvial ratios to be considered for retrieving alluvial pathways consistent with available piezometric and hydrogeological information are between 0 50 and 0 90 although the whole range of exponents here presented is worthy of being analyzed the higher the employed alluvial threshold the narrower the alluvial pathway that can be delineated across the domain like in fig 2 s panels furthermore the mean across thresholded alluvial ratios ρ the local probability χ x i of having a pathway exceeding a minimum alluvial threshold return as many exponents as many are the employed thresholds applied to the variable χ x i see schiavo 2022 again the exponent ρ decreases hand in hand with the increase of the threshold employed to affect all the mc simulations employed to achieve the local probability values values of β exponents depicted in fig 4 s panel a show a spanning range that decreases as the increase of thresholds moreover if a gd like expression can be employed to model fig 4 s panel b for example for probability spatial distributions obtained for threshold values between 0 10 and 0 90 the latter interval returns an exponent value of 0 32 0 30 for the whole ρ exponents range proving that the distribution of probability s exponents ρ can be themselves interpreted via gd the value of the β exponent and in the same way for ρ can be further investigated at various spatial inspection scales the values reported in fig 4 panel a have been obtained for s 2000 mc realizations of subsurface structures by taking all the locations fulfilling the condition of being regarded as mostly alluvial now a further synthetic numerical experiment is done by taking m 1000 subsets of different lengths ranges between 2 and 77 500 cells of each s th mc realization then each alluvial connected substructure is fitted through a gd 4 as done earlier in this paper the result for one exemplary mc alluvial soil realization and spanning all possible thresholds from 0 01 to 1 of alluvial soil ratio is reported in fig 5 for a reasonable threshold interval 0 1 0 9 fig 4 s panel c illustrates exponents across m randomly taken subsets i e connected pathways of various lengths for each threshold the result is strikingly similar to panel a s one at least for median values this aspect is underlined via fig 4 s panel d where the overall gd exponent across thresholds is fitted for randomly taken subsets blue line or for all locations of one mc realization exceeding a varying alluvial threshold the result of the overall fitting procedure via gd returns exponent values of 0 329 blue line subsets and 0 318 orange line which are very close to each other this means that the behavior of a gd s exponent β is scale free hence fractal rinaldo et al 1996 rodriguez iturbe et al 1998 since its dependence on the size of the sample of alluvial connected locations is incredibly poor similar results can of course be obtained by employing all the other mc realizations with a barely perceptible variation in the gd s exponent in any case between 0 31 and 0 34 of the distribution across thresholds 3 2 entropy of groundwater pathways entropy states are calculated for the last case study upon using various probability thresholds on χ x i the following fig 5 illustrates some panels along two exemplary transects panel a and f local entropy values are offered in panels d and i being calculated upon eq 6 and they decrease with the increase of the employed probability threshold imposed on χ x i for delineating a pathway this non linear relationship between the probability and the local entropy state thus the local energy dissipation is embedded within the 6 at a local scale fig 5 s panels b and g depict locations where the probability χ of finding a pathway upon an alluvial threshold of 0 50 is the highest and at these locations the local entropy fluctuations and energetic dissipation ones are the highest too groundwater pathways with a modest 0 50 occurrence probability are still quite disordered hence retaining high entropy values as well as spanning wide ranges of conductivities between nearby locations indeed locations embedded with high probability values are also those where entropy ones are negligible see panels b d and g i for the two exemplary transects nevertheless a full domain scale inspection reveals that the higher the employed threshold thr for delineating a pathway the closer the system to the zero free energy i e the average entropy is closer to zero with varying alluvial ratio thresholds the system might assume certain configurations hence pathways with the proper width permeability and occurrence probability χ to maximize energy dissipation lowering the local entropy to be as close as possible to the thermodynamic equilibrium rodriguez iturbe et al 1998 zehe et al 2019 in other words each groundwater system tends to reach the best possible energetic configuration these statements are fundamental to understanding the behavior of a groundwater system as a thermodynamic one moreover median entropy values too at a full scale are around zero meaning that ordered and disordered parts of a groundwater pathway are in a sort of balance at a wider inspection scale these findings exactly overlap the concept of zero free energy as a thermodynamic equilibrium point of a streamflow generation system discussed by zehe et al 2019 fig 6 s panels enable to deepen these findings and understand more about the thermodynamic behavior of a groundwater system upon varying delineating minimum probabilities panels a and c illustrate a hydrogeological section a a see fig 1 panel a where highly permeable aquifer bodies are highlighted by red dashed boxes panels b and d illustrates pathways probability and entropy via boxplots respectively while panel e is employed for appraising groundwater discharges quantified along section a a for details about groundwater discharges quantification see schiavo 2023 four types of pathways are investigated panels a and c as those delineated through minimum probabilistic thresholds of 0 50 purple line 0 75 yellow line 0 90 red line and 0 95 blue line as well as in schiavo 2022 as well as previously stated the highest permeable locations are those which are embedded by the highest probability of having a groundwater pathway by construction moreover highly permeable pathways are those with the lowest entropy values and with an energetic state closer to the zero free energy proposed by zehe et al 2019 hence more probable pathways are more energetically efficient and spatially ordered the spatial order comes from high probability values χ of having a pathway in a certain location and the energetic efficiency is confirmed by the alluvial nature of soils where local fluxes find less resistance being the path more conductive see baptista et al 2020 and high discharges tend to be conveyed this is confirmed by panel e s discharges which are generally higher where pathways are more permeable hence the soil is more conductive and therefore the probability of a highly permeable pathway is high and entropy magnitude tends to be negligible furthermore while highly permeable pathways see e g that delineated upon thr 0 95 are very close to being optimal since their overall entropy is close to zero on average see first boxplot in panel d less permeable ones are farther from a thermodynamic equilibrium the lower is the minimum alluvial soil threshold they are delineated with clayey silty or rocky parts of an aquifer body are those where conveyed discharges are low energy dissipation is high due to low conductivity and high local resistivity to groundwater flow hence entropy is high and the flow conduits may be highly disordered 4 discussion these results need to be discussed in several points first it is significant that geologically inferred preferential pathways within groundwater domains behave in the same way as river networks see e g troutman and karlinger 1992 and rinaldo et al 1996 hence their distribution can be appraised through fitting a gd this point is important for improving the current knowledge of driving similar but different hydrological processes in this case surface and groundwater flow pathways within a common phenomenon interpreting distribution the core result of the present work is the behavior of β and ρ exponent upon varying alluvial ratio thresholds and their framing within an energetic framework the higher the alluvial threshold the higher is the minimum alluvial ratio required for considering a depth averaged aquifer location as mostly alluvial hence being able to be crossed by a preferential pathway within the surficial aquifer the higher the threshold the lower the groundwater flow s minimum resistance within an alluvial aquifer location hence groundwater flow is likely to be conveyed where flow resistance is lower and the flux variable i e groundwater discharge is higher than elsewhere see e g baptista et al 2020 and schiavo 2022 the β and ρ exponents here presented retained a precise energetic signature as well as briefly reminded in the introduction of this work drainage networks are likely to be energetically described by a gd or a bolzmann like density function rinaldo et al 1996 the exponent of the cumulative distribution describing a tree shaped connected structure i e p s exp h γ s t regardless of gibbs parameter t is called hamiltonian and depicts the energetic state of the system rinaldo et al 1996 proved that for certain connected structure s the lower the values h γ s the lower the energy e j h γ s retained by the system and conversely its dissipation d j h γ s see e g howard 1990 schiavo et al 2022 that must locally respect an energy balance this comparison is fundamental to understanding the position of the present work since higher thresholds upon alluvial ratios return lower β exponents and narrower pathways the energy resistance d j that the flow encounters through them is lower than that one may obtain for higher exponents thus employing lower alluvial thresholds moreover higher ρ thresholds employed within the 5 return more probable pathways upon a previously fixed threshold thr flow resistance is lower too than is less probable pathways furthermore higher alluvial thresholds thr return more conductive hence less resistive flow pathways through the local aquifer body if the energy dissipation is framed as a kinetic variable d v m where v m s is local planar flow velocity and m a real exponent usually m 2 higher thresholds return lower energy dissipation along the pathway hence a colder one while wider pathways are described by higher gd s exponents and are locally more dissipative the same can be assessed for higher probable pathways inferred via higher p probability thresholds which are more likely to be delineated in locations where groundwater flow dissipates less energy and hence is more conveyed the higher the entropy the hotter the less conveyed and hence the wider and more dispersed is the flow pathway and it can be univocally described upon a gd 4 thus through its exponent β or the 5 hence upon exponent p if working in the probability space the spatial organization s stability of preferential pathways within the subsurface is resembled by their local occurrence probability χ x i which is higher for highly probable pathways where the groundwater body s conductivity is higher hence the flow is more conveyed and the average width is narrower than elsewhere across the domain groundwater connected pathways sharing a minimum alluvial soil ratio are fractals since their connectivity attribute is scale independent this can be achieved by fitting β exponents of a gd obtained by taking randomly sized samples of a connected pathway like the one referring to one mc realization of alluvial soil values exponents β across all possible thresholds are extremely weakly dependent on the size of the sample under investigation i e on the portion of the connected pathway to be fitted through a gd these last results fully reconcile the connectivity of geologically inferred subsurface pathways with previous literature about the fractality of self organized drainage networks see e g rigon et al 1994 and rinaldo et al 1995 in the end the variability of the exponent β across randomly taken pathways portions decreases with the increase of the employed alluvial threshold this implies that even slightly varying values of β may be appraised for different lengths of an alluvial pathway this range decreases with the temperature see rinaldo et al 1996 of the connected structure hence a cold subsurface pathway retains a limited spatial variability complementary as said with a high local probability that flow resides in a location a high degree of local order due to negative entropy values or close to zero as consequences of poorly varying gd exponents the temperature of a groundwater system rinaldo et al 1996 is directly dependent on its spatial structure highly probable groundwater pathways are significantly colder than those delineated upon lower probabilities the reason for that can be achieved by thinking that energy variations induced by a groundwater system alter its local energy values in other words its total local energy a system poorly sensitive to energy variations i e a pathway carved upon a very high probabilistic threshold p across equiprobable mc simulations is colder than another carved upon lower probabilistic requirements this means that gd exponents fully explain the order of the pathway hence its closeness or farness from a zero free energy thermodynamic point zehe et al 2019 this appears particularly interesting for transport problems at least for advective non reactive ones which may be considered disregarding geo chemical interactions and processes as underlined by zehe et al 2019 and zehe et al 2021 preferential flow self organization entropy work and contaminant transport are intimately related thus understanding one of these processes helps in understanding the others the findings in the present work state that highly probable pathways are those which are likely to be very permeable hence likely to convey high discharges moreover to be less resistive conduits with low temperature due to this larger energetic inertia the fluid and solutes are likely to be located within these pathways to meet the order in the flow path distribution as reflected in lower entropies then delineating most probable groundwater pathways would play a decisive role in understanding contaminants fate at least at a large scale which may subsequently vary according to particular boundary conditions or geo chemical ones low entropy values are proven to be likely where the probability of having a highly conductive pathway is high hence discharge tends to be more conveyed due to the porous medium s lower resistivity permeability for example in sandy or gravely aquifers on the contrary high entropy values can be assessed where permeabilities are low like in clayey or rocky soils and the flow tends to be less ordered hence retains less energetic efficiency and is more disperse see baptista et al 2020 thus retrieving gd s exponents for surrogating energy entropy signatures free energy and entropy is a novelty for geologically inferred groundwater pathways placing these findings in the context of the most advanced research within this field 5 conclusions the present work s major results can be summarized as follows preferential groundwater pathways achieved from solely geological data can be delineated upon an alluvial soil threshold thr and within the probability space upon a p one for each realization of an mc ensemble continuous alluvial locations can be fitted upon a gibbs distribution which has already been employed as a proper density function to describe connected structures such as surface drainage networks the fitting exponents β and ρ decrease at the increase of the alluvial threshold employed to delineate a groundwater pathway and their ml estimated range of variation higher exponents return both narrower and more probable connected structures then energy production and dissipation are lower there than elsewhere as resembled by lower exponents values which are proportional to the local system s energy as in the case of surface networks moreover higher conductive or probable connected pathways are colder than their lower probable counterparts because more stable to energy fluctuations than wider less conductive hence more resisting low conveying and thermodynamically hotter pathways where energy dissipation hence entropy is higher in the end gibbs distribution seems a proper choice to describe groundwater preferential pathways being employed to describe the intimate relationship between sediments spatial organization and energy production and dissipation along a groundwater pathway moreover the fractal and scale independent nature of alluvial pathways reconciles this viewpoint with the literature referring to energy based connected structures like optimal channel networks e g rinaldo et al 1996 and more in general surface drainage networks this is particularly interesting aiming to frame different phenomena or ways of assessing the physical reality regarding subsurface pathways features within a unique conceptual hence mathematical framework these results have been achieved starting from a geological set up and this represents a significant novelty in respect of the viewpoint drainage networks are framed their framing within the present scientific knowledge is strikingly consistent and complementary with available literature and theoretical energy related flow conceptualization achieved so far e g rinaldo et al 1996 about the thermodynamic framework zehe et al 2019 2021 and schiavo et al 2022 for the spatial organization of connected structures and baptista et al 2020 for the minimum energy dissipation within the most conductive conduits furthermore this work demonstrates upon a real data application that a groundwater system reaches a quasi thermodynamic equilibrium condition where the probability of having a highly permeable pathway is very high this work contributes to the scientific community by presenting a perspective from which geologically inferred connected structures can be framed within the same framework of surface drainage networks and may be usefully investigated toward a deeper appraisal of groundwater flow in complex systems a final remark is devoted to underlining how understanding groundwater systems and natural ones in a wider sense enables us to closely acknowledge the beauty of nature where nothing is random and what seems so is just highly organized and carefully dependent on phenomenological laws similar between different phenomena

1747,dissolved organic matter dom as a large carbon pool is key to biogeochemical cycles especially in some unique areas karst rivers typically exhibit unique biogeochemical characteristics and different human inputs whether and how these special differences affect dom distribution transport and composition are not clear here 134 samples were obtained from the daning river a typical karst river located in the mountain landscapes of the yangtze river during both the dry and wet seasons multiple methods including uv visible absorption three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy parallel factor analysis parafac principal component analysis pca and correlation analysis were used to research the molecular compositions optical properties and origins of dom during the wet season there was higher aromaticity and intensity of uv absorbing functional groups in dom the higher fmax of the protein like component in the wet season suggested more biological sources in dom pca indicated that autochthonous sources and biodegradation were the main sources of dom during the two seasons during the dry season forest showed the opposite effect on dom quality when compared to farmland and urban the findings demonstrated that monsoonal climate and biogeochemical processes were the primary reasons for the differences in dom components and sources which benefits the understanding of carbon biogeochemical processes in the karst rivers more importantly the analysis of dom composition and sources can provide valuable insights into identifying potential contaminants and understanding water quality variations which is beneficial to the concrete implementation of water protection keywords dissolved organic matter dom carbon biogeochemistry carbon cycles mountain landscape multi scale land use land cover data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom as a large carbon c pool in rivers is widely distributed in natural waters and more than half of which is dissolved organic carbon doc patriarca et al 2020 zhang et al 2011 dom a soluble heterogeneous mixture with a complex structure comprises conjugated aliphatic and aromatic groups dalmagro et al 2017 dom owns active biogeochemical properties and serves a crucial factor in controlling the mobility of organic pollutants and heavy metals aiken et al 2011 this unique nature significantly contributes to the intricate process in pollutant transport and fate for instance dom origin is reported to closely link to its chemical composition and thus its fate ni and li 2022 ni and li 2023 moreover research indicated that dom quality governed the dom biodegradation and thus largely contributed to aquatic co2 production zhang et al 2023 dom not only drives the delivery and transfer of substances but also plays a central role in the linkages of connecting c biogeochemical cycles within the terrestrial inland water and oceanic ecosystems ni et al 2020a dom may be affected by many processes e g rainfall degradation and human activities li et al 2022b while degradation and terrestrial input are among the two main processes yi et al 2021 terrestrial input introduces nutrients humic substances proteins and so on which can change the dom sources component and transformation zhang et al 2022 zhu et al 2019 active nitrogen n can be obtained by the photodegradation of dom which benefits the growth of phytoplankton bushaw et al 1996 furthermore refractory dom a potential carbon sink can be produced during the biodegradation process jiao et al 2010 hence it is significant to unravel sources transport and transformation processes of aquatic dom which are expected to reflect the changing natural environment and anthropogenic activities natural dom s chemical compositions and characters are used to trace the sources and environmental behaviors of dom causse et al 2017 to better understand dom sources transport transformation and environmental behaviors in river systems multiple effective methods are required optical technology has become one of the most effective methods for dom studies because of the intrinsic spectroscopic properties for different dom fractions the spectral slope and absorption coefficient have been widely used to dynamically monitor and characterize dom components and properties liu et al 2019a wei et al 2018 the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem technique integrated with parallel factor analysis parafac has been widely applied to distinguish dom sources because of the capacity of effectively sort overlapped fluorescent components into independent parts fan et al 2021 therefore combination of uv visible spectroscopy and the eem parafac technique help to identify the composition and sources of dom qualitatively and quantitatively and further explore its key role in the biogeochemical cycle at the molecular level about 15 of global earth land areas are karst areas ipcc climate 2007 which affect terrestrial c cycles and c uptaking liu et al 2018 in karst areas rivers usually have a higher dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentration because of the chemical weathering of carbonates he et al 2021 this characteristic benefits the biological carbon pump process which involves the shift from inorganic carbon into organic carbon and thereby affects the c cycle liu et al 2018 xia et al 2022 carbonate dissolution coupled photosynthesis significantly controls the c cycle in karst rivers liu et al 2010 and further regulates the generation and consumption of dom a previous study showed that the rock weathering rate has a negative correlation with dom abundance in the karst river lü et al 2020 the irregular rainfall in karst areas may change soil hydrology water and runoff status affecting dom composition and source in rivers kellerman et al 2018 however it remains unclear the important role that watershed land use land cover lulc plays in regulating the variability of dom in karst river ecosystems and whether the effects of lulc are consistent across a range of spatiotemporal scales shang et al 2018 furthermore studies on dom dynamic process and main influence factors are limited in the karst rivers therefore more studies on understanding the transport transformation and environmental behaviors of dom in karst rivers are urgently needed to achieve a better understanding of the global c cycle china has the largest karst area in the world i e 0 9 1 3 million km2 mainly located in the southwest region daning river a representative river with karst characteristics is located in the upper yangtze river in the three gorges reservoir tgr region this area also shows the different natural conditions and human activities from upstream to downstream it is understandably that there are highly variable exogenous and groundwater inputs to the river system in this area thereby affecting dom sources transport and composition the daning river is an ideal place to research dom migration and transformation in the aquatic systems of the karst area in relation to human activities and seasonality here multiple optical technologies including uv visible spectroscopy and eem parafac combined with statistical analysis were applied to further understand the karst riverine dom biogeochemistry cycle in the daning river of mountain landscapes the purpose of this research was to underscore the spatial and temporal variability in characteristics of dom in karst rivers and explore the possible sources and influencing mechanism we test the hypotheses that 1 climate seasonality will affect the molecular compositions and sources of dom under multi scales land use land cover and 2 autochthonous sources and biogeochemical processes drive the variations of dom in the karst rivers this study was devoted to reveal the dom biogeochemical processes in the karst rivers and key influencing factors this will further enrich the understanding of c cycle in

emission ex em 225 320 nm and 275 320 nm in the two seasons c1 could be classified as peak b protein like which is regarded as tyrosine like substance shi et al 2021 c2 with a peak of ex em 225 425 nm was considered as peak a humic like representing humic like fluorescence in the ultraviolet range zhu et al 2021 another peak of ex em 300 425 nm in c2 was regarded as peak m which represented biological degradation humic like zhao et al 2016 moreover c2 represented humic like and microbial oxidized components fellman et al 2009 zhu et al 2021 hence c2 could be regarded as mixture compounds of humus and microorganisms c3 had a peak of ex em 260 450 nm and was considered as peak c a traditional humic like lee et al 2008 stedmon et al 2003 it is worth noting that humic substances in c2 and c3 have different maximum ex and em wavelengths which is likely due to the different components and formation mechanism of dom xu et al 2021 furthermore the redshifted fluorescence peak of c3 indicated high aromatic and molecular weight compounds in c3 zhu et al 2021 c4 had a peak of ex em 280 330 nm it could be regarded as peak t protein like representing a tryptophan like substance lee et al 2021 the percentages of the identified eem components c1 c2 c3 and c4 in the two seasons are depicted in fig 4 and table s4 the percentages of c1 c2 and c4 showed significant variations p 0 001 in the two seasons the percentage of protein like c1 and c4 was higher than humic like c3 in the two seasons the percentage of mixed sources of c2 was higher in the dry season 38 62 when compared to the wet season 28 61 3 4 relationships between dom and water quality there were different relationships between dom and water quality during two seasons water quality seemed to be strongly related to dom quality variables in the dry season figs 7 and 8 in the dry season a280 c1 c2 and c3 showed significant p 0 05 relationships with do and codmn e2 e4 fi and hix showed significant p 0 05 relationships with dic in the wet season e2 e4 and c4 showed significant p 0 05 negative relationships with do c1 and c3 showed significant p 0 05 relationships with dic hix was positively correlated with codmn p 0 05 3 5 pca for seasonal variation of dom quality in the dry season three principal components pcs eigenvalue 1 were extracted which explained 83 12 of the total variance table 3 pc1 explained 46 14 of the variance and had strong loadings on c1 c3 c2 and moderate loadings on suva254 a280 and do pc2 explained 16 93 of the variance with moderate loadings of dic e2 e4 and sr while pc3 accounting for 12 21 of the variance with moderate loadings of suva254 a280 and c4 in the wet season three pcs with eigenvalue 1 were extracted and explained 69 57 of the total variance table 3 pc1 make up of strong loadings on c2 c1 and c3 explaining 32 51 of the variance pc2 accounting for 22 79 of the variance had a strong loading on do e2 e4 and c4 pc3 explained 14 27 of the total variance with loadings on suva254 and a280 3 6 effects of multi scale lulc on dom quality the compositions of lulc at multiple scales upstream each sampling site are shown in fig 6 and table s5 as the increasing of radius of the circular buffer proportion of forest land increased while proportions of farmland urban and water decreased at the four different circle buffers in the daning river the first three predominant land use types were forest 54 11 81 97 farmland 13 14 26 39 and urban 3 78 13 60 fig 6 table s5 the relationships between multiple lulc compositions and seasonal dom quality are shown in figs 7 and 8 lulc within the circles buffers upstream of sampling sites had more correlation with dom quality in the dry season than that in the wet season figs 7 and 8 during the wet season lulc within the circular buffers with different radius had comparable correlations with dom quality e2 e4 was positively correlated with urban coverage when circular buffers with radius of 500 m in the dry season lulc types including forest farmland urban and unused within circular buffers of radius of 500 and 1000 m at the upstream of sampling sites had same correlations with e2 e4 and fi and stronger than others two buffer scales e2 e4 and fi were positively correlated with farmland and urban coverage and negatively correlated with forest coverage lulc types of circular buffers with radius of 100 m at the upstream of sampling sites had the least correlation with dom quality 4 discussion 4 1 drivers of dom optical indicators variations in the monsoonal wet season the higher suva254 and e2 e4 fig 2 and table s3 indicated a higher aromatic and colored functional groups in dom peacock et al 2014 this could be partially attributed to the lower light intensity in the wet season which is beneficial to the high molecular weight dom accumulation resulting in higher aromaticity dom jiang et al 2018 more precipitation in the wet season enhanced terrigenous inputs of high aromaticity and colored functional groups of dom fichot and benner 2012 these two processes could lead to a lower sr fig 2 table s3 the relatively higher a280 in the dry season demonstrated higher protein of dom wang et al 2009 in the dry season relatively lower terrigenous inputs could amplify the effect of metabolism of algae and aquatic bacteria with base flow fellman et al 2009 resulting in relatively higher protein and sr of dom fig 2 the mean values of bix in both seasons were 0 8 0 93 vs 0 82 for dry and wet seasons fig 2 and table s3 indicating a biologic microbial source of dom table s1 however the wider bix range and lower mean values in the wet season indicate relatively lower biologic microbial sources and more terrestrial sources of dom especially at some sampling sites ma and li 2020 a bi plot of hix and bix fig s1 clearly indicated that dom was dominated by biologic microbial sources as reflected by bix 0 8 in both seasons the higher humification of dom can be found in the dry season as reflected by the higher hix values fig 2 and table s3 tipping et al 2009 this could be explained as follows in the dry season small molecules of dom are degraded by microorganisms eventually leading to the accumulation of large molecules resulting in higher humification in dom mayorga et al 2005 meyer and edwards 1990 furthermore there is low contribution of rainwater dilution and exogenous input by runoff during the dry season 4 2 temporal variations of dom sources and its potential controls dom had the same fluorescent components in both seasons fig 4 however the fmax and percentage of the four components were different fig 5 and s2 these findings indicated that more rainfall in the wet season enhanced terrigenous input and accumulation in the rivers via runoff and leaching shi et al 2020 therefore it is easily understood that the fmax of components in the wet season 968 84 684 81 a u was higher with respective to the dry season 554 17 448 87 a u fig s2 mao and li 2019 ni et al 2020b meanwhile the higher percentage of c1 in the wet season fig 5 and table s4 demonstrated a higher percentage of tyrosine like the higher percentage of c2 in the dry season fig 5 and table s4 indicated that there was more content of humic like fluorescence in the ultraviolet range microbial oxidized components and humic like components zhu et al 2021 the significantly seasonal variations in the c1and c2 proportion were inconsistent with some studies ma et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 this could be caused by the unique characteristics of the karst rivers and is explained as follows the higher ambient temperature in the wet season facilitated microbial extracellular enzyme activities resulting in production and release of more protein like dom cruz paredes et al 2021 shang et al 2018 moreover the studied karst rivers are located in the mountainous areas and human and animals wastes were directly discharged without further treatment as well as organic manure inputs by runoff which is useful for the primary production and metabolism of algae enhancing protein like abundance simon et al 2010 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 in addition higher light intensity promotes the stronger aquatic photosynthesis consistent with lower dic concentrations in the wet season which can promote phytoplankton metabolism and biological carbon pump resulting in more protein like dom xia et al 2022 the unique carbon cycling groundwater inputs and biological processes in the karst riversaffects the physicochemical characteristics of surface water he et al 2022 and further affects the composition of dom lü et al 2020 this was demonstrated by the negative correlation between c1 and do in the dry and negative correlation between c1 and dic in the wet season figs 7 and 8 the higher percentage of c4 in the dry season fig 5 indicated a higher percentage of tryptophan like coble 1996 in the dry season groundwater fed carbonate karst river systems in which nutrient rich clear water facilitates increased primary productivity and produces more protein like dom ma and li 2020 pu et al 2017 the seasonal variation in eem components indicated that the dominant sources of dom in the two seasons were variable due to different biodegradation and photo degradation processes by temperature and light changes as well as the unique biological carbon pump effect in karst rivers monsoonal climate strongly affects the dom sources composition and optical properties in the dry season pc1 was characteristic of large molecule accumulation and small molecule degradation coble 2007 with high negative loadings of protein like c1 and high positive loading of large molecule fractions c3 and mixture source fractions c2 coble 1996 liu et al 2019a as well as moderate negative loadings of aromaticity of dom suva254 and a280 pc2 represented autochthonous sources supported by moderate loadings on dic e2 e4 and sr pc3 indicates that autochthonous sources have moderate loadings on protein like c4 in the monsoonal wet season pc1 represented the process of large molecule accumulation and small molecule degradation supported by high negative loadings of c2 c3 and high positive loading of c1 coble 1996 liu et al 2019a pc2 represented the colored dom and carbonate dissolution in the karst river supported by moderate loadings of do e2 e4 sr c4 and low loading of dic pc3 was interpreted as the accumulation of aromaticity large molecule as well as exogenous source input supported by moderate loadings of suva254 and a280 pca indicated that the seasonal variation in dom was mainly due to biodegradation and the uniqueness of karst water carbon cycling more than external input 4 3 spatial variations of dom in relation to multi scale lulc in general lulc can influence the components and sources of riverine dom by regulating the riparian environment and increase exogenous chemical outputs further influencing the components and sources of dom liu et al 2017 as reflected by fig 7 previous studies have also shown that multiple spatial scales of land use are important factors in regulating nutrient and carbon both organic and inorganic carbon export from soils to rivers gu et al 2022b li et al 2022c riparian land use patterns within different buffer zones have significant effects on river nutrients and dom gu et al 2022b zhang et al 2023 meanwhile the effect of riparian lulc on river dom can be changed by hydrological conditions groundwater input and the uniqueness of the river itself borges et al 2018 li et al 2022a however in this research lulc effects on river dom were comparable in different radius buffers during the wet season moreover there were little significant correlations between multiple spatial scales of lulc and dom quality fig 8 these may be caused that severe soil and ditch erosion in the karst area can altered land water connectivity and reduce runoff input guo et al 2020a as well as dilution effect in the wet season meanwhile high forest coverage can improve soil stability and thus reduce terrestrial inputs which makes the effect of lulc on river dom is greatly attenuated felgate et al 2021 therefore multiple spatial scales of lulc have little effects on river dom in the dry season lulc types in circular buffers with radius of 500 and 1000 m had comparable effects on dom quality and stronger than those in circular buffers with radius of 100 and 250 m fig 7 this is consistent with reports that land use on narrower riparian zones plays a limited role in transporting nutrients and organic matter to streams shi et al 2017 within a circular buffer radius of 250 m there was a significant correlation between suva254 and forest fig 7 which was probably due to that the topsoil of forest area usually contains highly aromatic and recalcitrant substances of dom inamdar et al 2012 when the radius of circular buffers increased to 500 and 1000 m suva254 was not significantly correlated with forest which is due to that higher forest cover fig 6 and table s5 improves soil stability and reduces humic like dom export felgate et al 2021 e2 e4 and fi within circular buffers of 500 and 1000 m radius were positively associated with farmland urbanization fig 7 indicating that human induced land use leads to anthropogenic discharges and thus increases the levels of protein like and chromophoric fractions in riverine dom mcdonough et al 2020 the negative correlation between fi and forest fig 7 supported the study by lambert et al 2017 while was contrary to some other studies liu et al 2019b these inconsistent findings suggested that dom composition is variable in response to lulc type and that these variations reflect differences in regional environments including historical lulc types and biogeochemical processes in karst rivers in general in the dry season farmland and urban land exhibit contrasting roles in regulating the variability of dom characteristics and composition in contrast to the forestland in the study area previous studies have shown that dom chemical compositions play a vital role in interactions of heavy metal dom yamashita and jaffé 2008 understandably dom regulated by diverse land use types can have different effects on the transport and transformation of environmental pollutants ca heavy metals guo et al 2020b zhang et al 2022 the process above further affects water quality and biogeochemical cycle in the aquatic systems this phenomenon is particularly noteworthy in ecologically fragile karst regions in which these effects are likely to be amplified 4 4 implications dom can route delivery and transfer of nutrients metals and organic matter in aquatic ecosystems and then affect water quality situation battin et al 2008 dom composition and optical indicators can identify the types sources and key influencing factors of organic pollutants in water system carstea et al 2016 wang et al 2017 dom serves as a key precursor of disinfection products i e the formation pattern of disinfection byproducts is closely related to the composition and properties of dom zhou et al 2022 consequently understanding the characteristics of dom is highly valuable in providing insights into water quality condition and predicting potential contamination enabling proactive measures to be taken to improve water quality in a timely manner therefore analysis of dom compositions and optical properties plays a vital role in water quality management and water environmental protection the photodegradation and biodegradation process of dom can affect the formation of carbon sources and sinks jiao et al 2010 this phenomenon is more evident in the karst rivers because of carbonate dissolution groundwater supply and the unique carbon cycle liu et al 2010 our work provides important support for determining the potential role of karst rivers in china s national carbon neutral and international sustainable development goal sdg considering the influence of rapidly change of land use types anthropogenic activities and gas emission gu et al 2022a gu et al 2022b future research should be pay more attention to revealing dom sources components and optical properties as well as its couplings with gas exchange water quality assessment and potential pollution identification in river systems in the rapid urbanization areas land use management can mitigate nutrient inputs and gas emission in inland waters 5 conclusion the dissolved organic matter dom compositions and sources of the daning river in the karst area were underscored using uv vis optical indicators and eem parafac dom optical properties sources and compositions showed seasonal and spatial variations there was obviously higher aromaticity in dom during the wet season the component percentages indicated greater protein fraction of dom in the monsoonal wet season principle component analysis indicated that biodegradation is the primary driving force for dom variation during the two seasons the effects of lulc on dom characteristics and composition are more pronounced in the dry season the correlations between dom quality and lulc within circular buffers of radius of 500 and 1000 m were similar during the dry season and were stronger than others two buffer scales the combined results demonstrated that autochthonous sources and biogeochemical processes including biodegradation photodegradation and biological carbon pump in the karst rivers are most important to the seasonal and spatial changes in dom compositions and sources understanding the properties of dom is effective in studying transport and fate of contaminants water quality assessment and pollutant identification further we found that the distinct land use types exhibit contrasting impacts on the dom dynamics highlighting the importance of considering land use as a significant driver of dom variations therefore this research will be beneficial for comprehending the key effects of dom on biogeochemical cycles in the karst rivers and will further provide a well informed view of water quality monitoring and protection in the karst areas credit authorship

1747,dissolved organic matter dom as a large carbon pool is key to biogeochemical cycles especially in some unique areas karst rivers typically exhibit unique biogeochemical characteristics and different human inputs whether and how these special differences affect dom distribution transport and composition are not clear here 134 samples were obtained from the daning river a typical karst river located in the mountain landscapes of the yangtze river during both the dry and wet seasons multiple methods including uv visible absorption three dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy parallel factor analysis parafac principal component analysis pca and correlation analysis were used to research the molecular compositions optical properties and origins of dom during the wet season there was higher aromaticity and intensity of uv absorbing functional groups in dom the higher fmax of the protein like component in the wet season suggested more biological sources in dom pca indicated that autochthonous sources and biodegradation were the main sources of dom during the two seasons during the dry season forest showed the opposite effect on dom quality when compared to farmland and urban the findings demonstrated that monsoonal climate and biogeochemical processes were the primary reasons for the differences in dom components and sources which benefits the understanding of carbon biogeochemical processes in the karst rivers more importantly the analysis of dom composition and sources can provide valuable insights into identifying potential contaminants and understanding water quality variations which is beneficial to the concrete implementation of water protection keywords dissolved organic matter dom carbon biogeochemistry carbon cycles mountain landscape multi scale land use land cover data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom as a large carbon c pool in rivers is widely distributed in natural waters and more than half of which is dissolved organic carbon doc patriarca et al 2020 zhang et al 2011 dom a soluble heterogeneous mixture with a complex structure comprises conjugated aliphatic and aromatic groups dalmagro et al 2017 dom owns active biogeochemical properties and serves a crucial factor in controlling the mobility of organic pollutants and heavy metals aiken et al 2011 this unique nature significantly contributes to the intricate process in pollutant transport and fate for instance dom origin is reported to closely link to its chemical composition and thus its fate ni and li 2022 ni and li 2023 moreover research indicated that dom quality governed the dom biodegradation and thus largely contributed to aquatic co2 production zhang et al 2023 dom not only drives the delivery and transfer of substances but also plays a central role in the linkages of connecting c biogeochemical cycles within the terrestrial inland water and oceanic ecosystems ni et al 2020a dom may be affected by many processes e g rainfall degradation and human activities li et al 2022b while degradation and terrestrial input are among the two main processes yi et al 2021 terrestrial input introduces nutrients humic substances proteins and so on which can change the dom sources component and transformation zhang et al 2022 zhu et al 2019 active nitrogen n can be obtained by the photodegradation of dom which benefits the growth of phytoplankton bushaw et al 1996 furthermore refractory dom a potential carbon sink can be produced during the biodegradation process jiao et al 2010 hence it is significant to unravel sources transport and transformation processes of aquatic dom which are expected to reflect the changing natural environment and anthropogenic activities natural dom s chemical compositions and characters are used to trace the sources and environmental behaviors of dom causse et al 2017 to better understand dom sources transport transformation and environmental behaviors in river systems multiple effective methods are required optical technology has become one of the most effective methods for dom studies because of the intrinsic spectroscopic properties for different dom fractions the spectral slope and absorption coefficient have been widely used to dynamically monitor and characterize dom components and properties liu et al 2019a wei et al 2018 the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem technique integrated with parallel factor analysis parafac has been widely applied to distinguish dom sources because of the capacity of effectively sort overlapped fluorescent components into independent parts fan et al 2021 therefore combination of uv visible spectroscopy and the eem parafac technique help to identify the composition and sources of dom qualitatively and quantitatively and further explore its key role in the biogeochemical cycle at the molecular level about 15 of global earth land areas are karst areas ipcc climate 2007 which affect terrestrial c cycles and c uptaking liu et al 2018 in karst areas rivers usually have a higher dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentration because of the chemical weathering of carbonates he et al 2021 this characteristic benefits the biological carbon pump process which involves the shift from inorganic carbon into organic carbon and thereby affects the c cycle liu et al 2018 xia et al 2022 carbonate dissolution coupled photosynthesis significantly controls the c cycle in karst rivers liu et al 2010 and further regulates the generation and consumption of dom a previous study showed that the rock weathering rate has a negative correlation with dom abundance in the karst river lü et al 2020 the irregular rainfall in karst areas may change soil hydrology water and runoff status affecting dom composition and source in rivers kellerman et al 2018 however it remains unclear the important role that watershed land use land cover lulc plays in regulating the variability of dom in karst river ecosystems and whether the effects of lulc are consistent across a range of spatiotemporal scales shang et al 2018 furthermore studies on dom dynamic process and main influence factors are limited in the karst rivers therefore more studies on understanding the transport transformation and environmental behaviors of dom in karst rivers are urgently needed to achieve a better understanding of the global c cycle china has the largest karst area in the world i e 0 9 1 3 million km2 mainly located in the southwest region daning river a representative river with karst characteristics is located in the upper yangtze river in the three gorges reservoir tgr region this area also shows the different natural conditions and human activities from upstream to downstream it is understandably that there are highly variable exogenous and groundwater inputs to the river system in this area thereby affecting dom sources transport and composition the daning river is an ideal place to research dom migration and transformation in the aquatic systems of the karst area in relation to human activities and seasonality here multiple optical technologies including uv visible spectroscopy and eem parafac combined with statistical analysis were applied to further understand the karst riverine dom biogeochemistry cycle in the daning river of mountain landscapes the purpose of this research was to underscore the spatial and temporal variability in characteristics of dom in karst rivers and explore the possible sources and influencing mechanism we test the hypotheses that 1 climate seasonality will affect the molecular compositions and sources of dom under multi scales land use land cover and 2 autochthonous sources and biogeochemical processes drive the variations of dom in the karst rivers this study was devoted to reveal the dom biogeochemical processes in the karst rivers and key influencing factors this will further enrich the understanding of c cycle in relation to dry and wet seasonality and human disturbance 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the daning river is located in the wushan county and wuxi county 31 04 31 44 n 108 44 110 11 e of

were obtained from 35 sample sites in the daning river fig 1 each running water sample was obtained at about 10 cm below the water surface using an acid washed plastic container whatman glass microfiber filters with 0 7 μm pore size was used to filter the water samples the filtered samples were preserved in acid washed high density polyethylene hdpe bottles in the dark and transported with ice to the laboratory electrical conductivity ec ph do and water temperature twater were measured in situ using an hq40d multi parameters system hach usa with carefully calibrated and stabilized for

the measurement error was 2 the uv vis absorbance of dom was determined using lambda 35 uv vis spectrometer perkinelmer usa with a measurement accuracy of 5 dom optical properties were researched by suva254 cook et al 2017 a280 kolic et al 2014 e2 e4 peacock et al 2014 and sr fichot and benner 2012 the eem spectra of dom were determined by spectrofluorometer hitachi f 7000 japan the emission em scans were performed in a range of 250 500 nm and excitation ex scans were performed in a range of 200 400 nm both types of scans were performed with 2 nm increments eem of deionized water was used as blanks to offset the influence of water raman scattering all the eems were determined in duplicate with a measurement error below 2 murphy et al 2010 matlab r2007 and the dom fluor toolbox were used to perform parafac modeling wang et al 2017 during the procedure of parafac analysis necessary operations e g outlier identification the optimal number of components split half analysis have been performed for better results then dom components were identified through the shape and location of peaks the detailed information about dom optical indices is shown in table s1 2 3 land use land cover lulc delineation to examine the effects of multi scale riparian lulc on dom circular buffers with radius of 100 250 500 and 1000 m at upstream of sampling sites were extracted by arcgis 10 2 software

forest land i e forest grassland shrubland water and unused land i e bare land and wetland fig 1 2 4 statistical analyses the wet and dry seasonal variations in the key water quality parameters and dom optical properties were evaluated by the nonparametric mann whitney u test ma et al 2021 the relationships among the concentration of doc and suva254 a280 e2 e4 sr fi bix hix c1 c2 c3 c4 water quality parameters and lulc of circular buffers with different radius were performed by correlation analyses the possible dom sources and compositions were researched by principal component analysis

were made using spss 18 0 3 results 3 1 parameters of water quality the parameters of key water quality are shown in table 1 ec codmn and ph had no significant variations during the two seasons the mean ph value in the wet season 8 57 0 36 was slightly higher than that in the dry season 8 18 0 25 the average ec in the dry 283 51 64 92 μs cm and wet seasons 284 47 76 67 μs cm was similar the

value of dic in the dry season 27 84 4 56 mg l was higher in contrast to the wet season 24 11 6 46 c the mean value of do was higher in the dry season 11 75 1 57 mg l in comparison to the wet season 8 63 0 64 mg l as expected the average of twater in the dry season 12 30 1 23 c was much lower when compared to the wet season 18 72 3 93 c 3 2 the optical properties of dom by uv vis absorbance and fluorescence the values of suva254 a280 e2 e4 sr fi bix and hix are shown in figs 2 and 3 and table s3 suva254 e2 e4 bix and hix indicated significant seasonal and spatial variations p 0 001 the average and median of a280 were slightly higher in the dry season with an average of 3 85 2 56 0 28 9 81 in the dry season and 3 31 1 39 1 29 7 62 in the wet season the median of sr was comparable

spatial changes of suva254 e2 e4 bix and hix were observed in the daning river areas with different lulc during the two seasons fig 3 and table s3 3 3 eem components of dom by parafac analysis the eem based components of dom are shown in fig 3 and table 2 parafac analysis extracted four similar components from the eem dataset during the two seasons fig 3 c1 had two obvious peaks at excitation emission ex em 225 320 nm and 275 320 nm in the two seasons c1 could be classified as peak b protein like which is regarded as tyrosine like substance shi et al 2021 c2 with a peak of ex em 225 425 nm was considered as peak a humic like representing humic like fluorescence in the ultraviolet range zhu et al 2021 another peak of ex em 300 425 nm in c2 was regarded as peak m which represented biological degradation humic like zhao et al 2016 moreover c2 represented humic like and microbial oxidized components fellman et al 2009 zhu et al 2021 hence c2 could be regarded as mixture compounds of humus and microorganisms c3 had a peak of ex em 260 450 nm and was considered as peak c a traditional humic like lee et al 2008 stedmon et al 2003 it is worth noting that humic substances in c2 and c3 have different maximum ex and em wavelengths which is likely due to the different components and formation mechanism of dom xu et al 2021 furthermore the redshifted fluorescence peak of c3 indicated high aromatic and molecular weight compounds in c3 zhu et al 2021 c4 had a peak of ex em 280 330 nm it could be regarded as peak t protein like representing a tryptophan like substance lee et al 2021 the percentages of the identified eem components c1 c2 c3 and c4 in the two seasons are depicted in fig 4 and table s4 the percentages of c1 c2 and c4 showed significant variations p 0 001 in the two seasons the percentage of protein like c1 and c4 was higher than humic like c3 in the two seasons the percentage of mixed sources of c2 was higher in the dry season 38 62 when compared to the wet season 28 61 3 4 relationships between dom and water quality there were different relationships between dom and water quality during two seasons water quality seemed to be strongly related to dom quality variables in the dry season figs 7 and 8 in the dry season a280 c1 c2 and c3 showed significant p 0 05 relationships with do and codmn e2 e4 fi and hix showed significant p 0 05 relationships with dic in the wet season e2 e4 and c4 showed significant p 0 05 negative relationships with do c1 and c3 showed significant p 0 05 relationships with dic hix was positively correlated with codmn p 0 05 3 5 pca for seasonal variation of dom quality in the dry season three principal components pcs eigenvalue 1 were extracted which explained 83 12 of the total variance table 3 pc1 explained 46 14 of the variance and had strong loadings on c1 c3 c2 and moderate loadings on suva254 a280 and do pc2 explained 16 93 of the variance with moderate loadings of dic e2 e4 and sr while pc3 accounting for 12 21 of the variance with moderate loadings of suva254 a280 and c4 in the wet season three pcs with eigenvalue 1 were extracted and explained 69 57 of the total variance table 3 pc1 make up of strong loadings on c2 c1 and c3 explaining 32 51 of the variance pc2 accounting for 22 79 of the variance had a strong loading on do e2 e4 and c4 pc3 explained 14 27 of the total variance with loadings on suva254 and a280 3 6 effects of multi scale lulc on dom quality the compositions of lulc at multiple scales upstream each sampling site are shown in fig 6 and table s5 as the increasing of radius of the circular buffer proportion of forest land increased while proportions of farmland urban and water decreased at the four different circle buffers in the daning river the first three predominant land use types were forest 54 11 81 97 farmland 13 14 26 39 and urban 3 78 13 60 fig 6 table s5 the relationships between multiple lulc compositions and seasonal dom quality are shown in figs 7 and 8 lulc within the circles buffers upstream of sampling sites had more correlation with dom quality in the dry season than that in the wet season figs 7 and 8 during the wet season lulc within the circular buffers with different radius had comparable correlations with dom quality e2 e4 was positively correlated with urban coverage when circular buffers with radius of 500 m in the dry season lulc types including forest farmland urban and unused within circular buffers of radius of 500 and 1000 m at the upstream of sampling sites had same correlations with e2 e4 and fi and stronger than others two buffer scales e2 e4 and fi were positively correlated with farmland and urban coverage and negatively correlated with forest coverage lulc types of circular buffers with radius of 100 m at the upstream of sampling sites had the least correlation with dom quality 4 discussion 4 1 drivers of dom optical indicators variations in the monsoonal wet season the higher suva254 and e2 e4 fig 2 and table s3 indicated a higher aromatic and colored functional groups in dom peacock et al 2014 this could be partially attributed to the lower light intensity in the wet season which is beneficial to the high molecular weight dom accumulation resulting in higher aromaticity dom jiang et al 2018 more precipitation in the wet season enhanced terrigenous inputs of high aromaticity and colored functional groups of dom fichot and benner 2012 these two processes could lead to a lower sr fig 2 table s3 the relatively higher a280 in the dry season demonstrated higher protein of dom wang et al 2009 in the dry season relatively lower terrigenous inputs could amplify the effect of metabolism of algae and aquatic bacteria with base flow fellman et al 2009 resulting in relatively higher protein and sr of dom fig 2 the mean values of bix in both seasons were 0 8 0 93 vs 0 82 for dry and wet seasons fig 2 and table s3 indicating a biologic microbial source of dom table s1 however the wider bix range and lower mean values in the wet season indicate relatively lower biologic microbial sources and more terrestrial sources of dom especially at some sampling sites ma and li 2020 a bi plot of hix and bix fig s1 clearly indicated that dom was dominated by biologic microbial sources as reflected by bix 0 8 in both seasons the higher humification of dom can be found in the dry season as reflected by the higher hix values fig 2 and table s3 tipping et al 2009 this could be explained as follows in the dry season small molecules of dom are degraded by microorganisms eventually leading to the accumulation of large molecules resulting in higher humification in dom mayorga et al 2005 meyer and edwards 1990 furthermore there is low contribution of rainwater dilution and exogenous input by runoff during the dry season 4 2 temporal variations of dom sources and its potential controls dom had the same fluorescent components in both seasons fig 4 however the fmax and percentage of the four components were different fig 5 and s2 these findings indicated that more rainfall in the wet season enhanced terrigenous input and accumulation in the rivers via runoff and leaching shi et al 2020 therefore it is easily understood that the fmax of components in the wet season 968 84 684 81 a u was higher with respective to the dry season 554 17 448 87 a u fig s2 mao and li 2019 ni et al 2020b meanwhile the higher percentage of c1 in the wet season fig 5 and table s4 demonstrated a higher percentage of tyrosine like the higher percentage of c2 in the dry season fig 5 and table s4 indicated that there was more content of humic like fluorescence in the ultraviolet range microbial oxidized components and humic like components zhu et al 2021 the significantly seasonal variations in the c1and c2 proportion were inconsistent with some studies ma et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 this could be caused by the unique characteristics of the karst rivers and is explained as follows the higher ambient temperature in the wet season facilitated microbial extracellular enzyme activities resulting in production and release of more protein like dom cruz paredes et al 2021 shang et al 2018 moreover the studied karst rivers are located in the mountainous areas and human and animals wastes were directly discharged without further treatment as well as organic manure inputs by runoff which is useful for the primary production and metabolism of algae enhancing protein like abundance simon et al 2010 wilson and xenopoulos 2009 in addition higher light intensity promotes the stronger aquatic photosynthesis consistent with lower dic concentrations in the wet season which can promote phytoplankton metabolism and biological carbon pump resulting in more protein like dom xia et al 2022 the unique carbon cycling groundwater inputs and biological processes in the karst riversaffects the physicochemical characteristics of surface water he et al 2022 and further affects the composition of dom lü et al 2020 this was demonstrated by the negative correlation between c1 and do in the dry and negative correlation between c1 and dic in the wet season figs 7 and 8 the higher percentage of c4 in the dry season fig 5 indicated a higher percentage of tryptophan like coble 1996 in the dry season groundwater fed carbonate karst river systems in which nutrient rich clear water facilitates increased primary productivity and produces more protein like dom ma and li 2020 pu et al 2017 the seasonal variation in eem components indicated that the dominant sources of dom in the two seasons were variable due to different biodegradation and photo degradation processes by temperature and light changes as well as the unique biological carbon pump effect in karst rivers monsoonal climate strongly affects the dom sources composition and optical properties in the dry season pc1 was characteristic of large molecule accumulation and small molecule degradation coble 2007 with high negative loadings of protein like c1 and high positive loading of large molecule fractions c3 and mixture source fractions c2 coble 1996 liu et al 2019a as well as moderate negative loadings of aromaticity of dom suva254 and a280 pc2 represented autochthonous sources supported by moderate loadings on dic e2 e4 and sr pc3 indicates that autochthonous sources have moderate loadings on protein like c4 in the monsoonal wet season pc1 represented the process of large molecule accumulation and small molecule degradation supported by high negative loadings of c2 c3 and high positive loading of c1 coble 1996 liu et al 2019a pc2 represented the colored dom and carbonate dissolution in the karst river supported by moderate loadings of do e2 e4 sr c4 and low loading of dic pc3 was interpreted as the accumulation of aromaticity large molecule as well as exogenous source input supported by moderate loadings of suva254 and a280 pca indicated that the seasonal variation in dom was mainly due to biodegradation and the uniqueness of karst water carbon cycling more than external input 4 3 spatial variations of dom in relation to multi scale lulc in general lulc can influence the components and sources of riverine dom by regulating the riparian environment and increase exogenous chemical outputs further influencing the components and sources of dom liu et al 2017 as reflected by fig 7 previous studies have also shown that multiple spatial scales of land use are important factors in regulating nutrient and carbon both organic and inorganic carbon export from soils to rivers gu et al 2022b li et al 2022c riparian land use patterns within different buffer zones have significant effects on river nutrients and dom gu et al 2022b zhang et al 2023 meanwhile the effect of riparian lulc on river dom can be changed by hydrological conditions groundwater input and the uniqueness of the river itself borges et al 2018 li et al 2022a however in this research lulc effects on river dom were comparable in different radius buffers during the wet season moreover there were little significant correlations between multiple spatial scales of lulc and dom quality fig 8 these may be caused that severe soil and ditch erosion in the karst area can altered land water connectivity and reduce runoff input guo et al 2020a as well as dilution effect in the wet season meanwhile high forest coverage can improve soil stability and thus reduce terrestrial inputs which makes the effect of lulc on river dom is greatly attenuated felgate et al 2021 therefore multiple spatial scales of lulc have little effects on river dom in the dry season lulc types in circular buffers with radius of 500 and 1000 m had comparable effects on dom quality and stronger than those in circular buffers with radius of 100 and 250 m fig 7 this is consistent with reports that land use on narrower riparian zones plays a limited role in transporting nutrients and organic matter to streams shi et al 2017 within a circular buffer radius of 250 m there was a significant correlation between suva254 and forest fig 7 which was probably due to that the topsoil of forest area usually contains highly aromatic and recalcitrant substances of dom inamdar et al 2012 when the radius of circular buffers increased to 500 and 1000 m suva254 was not significantly correlated with forest which is due to that higher forest cover fig 6 and table s5 improves soil stability and reduces humic like dom export felgate et al 2021 e2 e4 and fi within circular buffers of 500 and 1000 m radius were positively associated with farmland urbanization fig 7 indicating that human induced land use leads to anthropogenic discharges and thus increases the levels of protein like and chromophoric fractions in riverine dom mcdonough et al 2020 the negative correlation between fi and forest fig 7 supported the study by lambert et al 2017 while was contrary to some other studies liu et al 2019b these inconsistent findings suggested that dom composition is variable in response to lulc type and that these variations reflect differences in regional environments including historical lulc types and biogeochemical processes in karst rivers in general in the dry season farmland and urban land exhibit contrasting roles in regulating the variability of dom characteristics and composition in contrast to the forestland in the study area previous studies have shown that dom chemical compositions play a vital role in interactions of heavy metal dom yamashita and jaffé 2008 understandably dom regulated by diverse land use types can have different effects on the transport and transformation of environmental pollutants ca heavy metals guo et al 2020b zhang et al 2022 the process above further affects water quality and biogeochemical cycle in the aquatic systems this phenomenon is particularly noteworthy in ecologically fragile karst regions in which these effects are likely to be amplified 4 4 implications dom can route delivery and transfer of nutrients metals and organic matter in aquatic ecosystems and then affect water quality situation battin et al 2008 dom composition and optical indicators can identify the types sources and key influencing factors of organic pollutants in water system carstea et al 2016 wang et al 2017 dom serves as a key precursor of disinfection products i e the formation pattern of disinfection byproducts is closely related to the composition and properties of dom zhou et al 2022 consequently understanding the characteristics of dom is highly valuable in providing insights into water quality condition and predicting potential contamination enabling proactive measures to be taken to improve water quality in a timely manner therefore analysis of dom compositions and optical properties plays a vital role in water quality management and water environmental protection the photodegradation and biodegradation process of dom can affect the formation of carbon sources and sinks jiao et al 2010 this phenomenon is more evident in the karst rivers because of carbonate dissolution groundwater supply and the unique carbon cycle liu et al 2010 our work provides important support for determining the potential role of karst rivers in china s national carbon neutral and international sustainable development goal sdg considering the influence of rapidly change of land use types anthropogenic activities and gas emission gu et al 2022a gu et al 2022b future research should be pay more attention to revealing dom sources components and optical properties as well as its couplings with gas exchange water quality assessment and potential pollution identification in river systems in the rapid urbanization areas land use management can mitigate nutrient inputs and gas emission in inland waters 5 conclusion the dissolved organic matter dom compositions and sources of the daning river in the karst area were underscored using uv vis optical indicators and eem parafac dom optical properties sources and compositions showed seasonal and spatial variations there was obviously higher aromaticity in dom during the wet season the component percentages indicated greater protein fraction of dom in the monsoonal wet season principle component analysis indicated that biodegradation is the primary driving force for dom variation during the two seasons the effects of lulc on dom characteristics and composition are more pronounced in the dry season the correlations between dom quality and lulc within circular buffers of radius of 500 and 1000 m were similar during the dry season and were stronger than others two buffer scales the combined results demonstrated that autochthonous sources and biogeochemical processes including biodegradation photodegradation and biological carbon pump in the karst rivers are most important to the seasonal and spatial changes in dom compositions and sources understanding the properties of dom is effective in studying transport and fate of contaminants water quality assessment and pollutant identification further we found that the distinct land use types exhibit contrasting impacts on the dom dynamics highlighting the importance of considering land use as a significant driver of dom variations therefore this research will be beneficial for comprehending the key effects of dom on biogeochemical cycles in the karst rivers and will further provide a well informed view of water quality monitoring and protection in the karst areas credit authorship

1748,mountain water resources are considered to be the world s water towers still despite their importance for downstream societies and ecosystems and their vulnerability to climate change they remain poorly understood it is the case in particular of mountain groundwater systems their complexity makes them difficult to conceptualize while their remoteness makes them difficult to study both observationally and instrumentally understanding mountain hydrogeological systems is mostly limited by the lack of characterization of the subsurface geologic framework and by the limited understanding of the role of geological structures on groundwater flow and on surface water groundwater interaction removing methodological barriers is therefore a necessary step for improving the understanding of mountain hydrogeological systems to tackle this problem we develop a comprehensive multi disciplinary approach to gain insights into the hydrogeological role of geological structures in ungauged mountain catchments the methodology consists of several complementary methods 1 geological mapping at multiple scales 2 a geophysical study including on ground electrical resistivity tomography ert and gravimetry transects and a uav based magnetic survey 3 hydraulic data including a 9 km long transect of streamflow measurements in the recession period the long term normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and varied hydric markers e g a thermal spring and a puddle the methodology is tested in the parque nacional del río clarillo an ungauged catchment in the andes mountains 130 km2 that is illustrative of the complexity of mountain hydrosystems featuring fault zones weathered zones intrusive rocks and volcano sedimentary successions an increase of approximately 50 in the streamflow is observed over a short distance of 1 km such a localized and significant increase in the baseflow is not related to any superficial supply and can only be explained by groundwater exfiltration based on the multiscale geological mapping and geophysical survey a regional n s fault and a secondary set of e w local faults are identified in the vicinity of the resurgence area which conjointly are likely to export groundwater from a neighbouring subcatchment up to the resurgence area downstream of the resurgence area no significant change in the baseflow is observed corresponding to the presence of an impermeable granitic pluton identified by the geological and geophysical mapping finally a fractured zone in the andean foothills is identified in the volcanic unit which coincides with a perennial thermal spring indicating upwelling flow and hydrogeological connectivity between the mountain block and the alluvial basin the results strongly support the ability of the proposed methodology to identify geological structures that substantially impact the evolution of the baseflow through the catchment the complementary multi disciplinary methods are used innovatively to infer the link between geological and hydrogeological structures the methodology does not aim to fully characterize the geological framework of the catchment but pragmatically focuses on hydrogeologically pertinent structures that may impact baseflow and consequently catchment management keywords structural geology uav based magnetic hydrogeophysics fault zone mountain aquifer groundwater surface water interaction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction interest in mountain catchments has been growing recently markovich et al 2019 and references within mountains serve as water reservoirs for downstream alluvial basins due to the heavy precipitation they receive immerzeel et al 2020 somers and mckenzie 2020 more than half of humanity depends on mountain hydrosystems for their water supply grêt regamey et al 2012 snow and glacier dominated hydrosystems supply more than one sixth of the world s population barnett et al 2005 human dependence on these systems is all the more critical as they are particularly vulnerable to climate change beniston 2003 huss et al 2017 viviroli et al 2011 understanding the functioning of mountain blocks and their hydraulic connectivity with anthropized basins downstream is thus critical for water resource management kamenik et al 2001 mcdonnell 2003 soulsby et al 2007 as well as for society s resilience to climate change hayashi 2020 viviroli et al 2020 furthermore mountain catchments constitute preserved spaces and biosphere reserves in some cases harbouring endemic or native species clarke et al 2008 freeman et al 2007 meyer et al 2007 and providing various ecosystem services egan and price 2017 however despite their importance mountain hydrogeological systems remain poorly understood bishop et al 2008 owing to their inherent complexity stemming from significant topographic climatic and geological gradients in particular the interplay of geology geomorphology and climate on groundwater flow and related variables is barely understood condon and maxwell 2015 gleeson and manning 2008 winter 2001 for example groundwater flow scale depth distribution markovich et al 2019 roques et al 2014 and recharge mccord et al 1997 nicolas et al 2019 sanford 2002 white and burbey 2007 groundwater surface water interaction brunner et al 2009 fleckenstein et al 2010 groundwater timescales jasechko et al 2016 and river ecology and biogeochemistry kolbe et al 2016 weyer et al 2014 the geological heterogeneity of mountain blocks related to multiscale fracturing lithological discontinuities weathering etc is likely to substantially control groundwater flow as significant gradients of the hydraulic conductivity induce flow anisotropy leray et al 2012 2013 flow channelling intercatchment flow fan 2019 and possibly groundwater exfiltration bense et al 2013 caine et al 1996 scibek et al 2016 although studies indicate that geological structures substantially impact groundwater surface water interaction schaller and fan 2009 and stream flowrate and regime most studies have focused on the role of climate and geomorphology condon and maxwell 2015 cuthbert et al 2019 gleeson and manning 2008 welch and allen 2012 the geological complexity of hydrogeological systems strongly impedes the generalization of in situ observations and site specific results and accordingly limits the development of unified hydrogeological frameworks markovich et al 2019 wilson and guan 2004 worse mountain hydrogeological systems remain mainly uncharacterized as their steep topographic gradients and remoteness strongly limit access and site instrumentation the scientific bottleneck regarding the understanding of the hydrogeological functioning of mountain groundwater systems is therefore above all a methodological gap the filling of which requires the improved characterization of their subsurface geologic framework bense et al 2013 markovich et al 2019 groundwater flow paths and origins in mountain catchments have traditionally been inferred using hydrogeochemistry water stable isotopes and environmental tracers such as noble gases and anthropogenic tracers alvarez campos et al 2022 baraer et al 2015 hilberg 2016 jung et al 2021 ma et al 2018 manning and solomon 2005 as they directly derive from flow processes these methods can theoretically compensate for the lack of direct observations of hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradients from standard hydraulic methods boreholes pumping tests ginn et al 2009 however because of water mixing processes they constitute integrative methods that remain poorly effective to differentiate between hydrogeological models at the local scale troldborg et al 2007 and to identify hydrogeologically pertinent structures in complex systems leray et al 2012 hence in the absence of end member waters with significantly different chemical signatures the deconvolution of tracers and hydrogeochemical data is extremely challenging water balance analysis is a straightforward method that has been mainly used for the estimation of water balance components and for closing the water balance andermann et al 2012 cochand et al 2019 hood and hayashi 2015 mcclymont et al 2010 however closing the water balance may be strongly impaired in small ungauged catchments where the large amount of data required is not satisfied as ground data are rarely available and remote sensing data are often too coarse acharya et al 2021 hobouchian et al 2017 longuevergne et al 2010 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 besides addressing the role of geological structures on groundwater flow and surface water groundwater interaction implicitly requires the selection of characterization methods that are able to image geological discontinuities that is those with a relatively fine resolution tens of meters in this context geophysics has emerged as a non destructive method to survey the subsurface at various scales and depths and in some occasions hydrogeological processes binley et al 2015 robinson et al 2008 electrical resistivity tomography ert has been widely used samouelian et al 2005 for soil moisture studies araya vargas et al 2021 the identification of groundwater aquifer geometry and the study of geological structures ball et al 2010 martos rosillo et al 2019 robert et al 2011 ert cross sections can be aligned to reveal resistivity contrasts resulting from geological structures and to construct a 3d representation based on previous geological knowledge figueroa et al 2021 gravity surveys can be performed at different spatial scales from local to regional and can identify tiny changes in gravity to obtain structural information telford et al 1990 gravity surveys are generally used to delineate the basement depth of sedimentary basins abbott and louie 2000 figueroa et al 2021 murty and raghavan 2002 yáñez et al 2015 however they can also be used to identify geological contacts and discontinuities that do not outcrop ruelleu et al 2010 while they can be used to image geological structures the abovementioned methods and many more geophysical methods are unable to image hydrogeological features without an additional hydraulic based constraint such as groundwater level water resurgences etc besides ground geophysical surveys of mountain catchments are limited by their remoteness which has raised interest in the use of aerial surveys so far aerial geophysical surveys have been conducted by helicopter or airplane for large scale studies 1 000 km2 focusing on major regional geological structures dumont et al 2021 hussien et al 2017 lopez loera et al 2015 reeves 2005 vittecoq et al 2019 yet the recent emergence of drones uav has offered a potential means to explore the subsurface framework at much smaller scales and more systematically thanks to their smaller clearance distances less than 50 m and closer profiles hydrogeology is fundamentally at the cross roads of various disciplines and multidisciplinary approaches have naturally shown their value for characterizing understanding and managing groundwater as the joint use of various methods makes it possible to more widely cover the parameters space kreamer et al 2021 regarding mountain catchments studies based on various methods became essential to develop a more in depth knowledge of hydrogeological systems and to propose new conceptual models of their hydrogeological functioning christensen et al 2020 manning et al 2021 markovich et al 2021 ruiz pereira et al 2023 somers et al 2016 however the choice of data that are informative and complementary enough and the interaction between disciplines that may not share the same approaches and perceptions are in itself challenging the main objective of this study is to develop a novel multi disciplinary approach to assess the hydrogeological role of geological features at the catchment scale in ungauged mountain catchments to do so we perform a thorough geological characterization through a multiscale geological mapping and ground and aerial geophysical instrumentation to accurately outline both the surface and the subsurface geological framework to clearly establish the impact of geological features and heterogeneity on hydrogeological structures hydrogeological information is retrieved from various sources and various data types including spatially distributed baseflow measurements the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and a thermal spring location and temperature the multidisciplinary methodology is designed to get a comprehensive understanding of the system and establish a causal link between geological and hydrogeological features which cannot be achieved by each of the methods separately the scope of this study is functional and pragmatical aiming to identify the key geological structures for groundwater flow but not the entire geological framework and focusing on a key hydrological variable which is the streamflow in the following section we present the application of the methodology to the parque nacional del río clarillo an ungauged mountain catchment in chile whose large geological heterogeneity is illustrative of both the scientific and methodological challenges to the analysis of mountain groundwater systems after presenting the results in section 3 we discuss the capacity of various hydrogeological conceptual models to explain the observed streamflow variations and hydric singularities as well as the differentiating aspects and novelty of the proposed approach 2 study site and methodology 2 1 study site 2 1 1 climatic context the parque nacional del río clarillo is an ungauged catchment with an area of 130 km2 located 35 km southeast of santiago 33 72 70 49 fig 1 a and b situated in a semi arid climate the park is suffering from the uninterrupted drought that has been affecting central chile since 2010 and had led to a decrease in precipitation of about 30 in this region garreaud et al 2020 though presenting significant interannual variability the average annual precipitation downstream of the park historically amounted to approximately 700 mm during the period 1990 2010 dmc 2023 however since the beginning of the drought it very often does not exceed 300 mm and reached 400 mm on very few occasions dmc 2023 accordingly observations by park rangers and technical studies niemeyer 2002 point at a severe reduction of the río clarillo baseflow of close to 75 still these observations should be interpreted with caution as they remain very sparse the río clarillo regime is pluvionival with streamflow maintained by snowmelt in the upper part of the catchment while snowmelt historically lasted up to the end of march the past few years have shown an earlier melting which rarely persists after january according to observations by park rangers 2 1 2 geological context the present day configuration of the andes of central chile is marked by the development of two margin parallel ranges the coastal cordillera to the west and the principal cordillera to the east separated by the central depression alluvial plain the study area is located on the western margin of the principal cordillera fig 1a and is uplifted by more than 2 000 m over the central depression by the cumulative displacement of the west vergent san ramón pocuro fault system srpfs armijo et al 2010 rauld 2002 the geology of the río clarillo catchment records the evolution of the western margin of the eocene miocene abanico basin fig 1c this includes the volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the extensional phase of the abanico basin the abanico formation oligocene miocene and the volcanic rocks that represent the tectonic inversion of the basin that is the miocene farellones formation charrier et al 2002 these stratified units are intruded by granitic rocks of the la obra pluton c a 21 ma fig 1c however at the scale of this work there is no consensus on whether the rock bodies outcropping in the río clarillo catchment should be assigned to these formal units fock 2005 piquer et al 2021 2017 thiele 1980 at the regional scale the abanico formation shows intense deformation of tight west vergent folds in the westernmost outcrops that gradually decreases towards the east to wide and open folds the farellones formation lies unconformably over the tight folds affecting the abanico formation in the westernmost outcrops showing less intense folding and becomes gradually parallel to the underlying abanico formation towards the east charrier et al 2002 fock 2005 scarce pliocene to holocene alluvial and fluvial deposits are preserved in the main fluvial valley and in tributary ravines from the mouth of the río clarillo valley alluvial deposits show a strong increase in thickness towards the central depression reaching a thickness of up to 500 m gonzález et al 2018 yáñez et al 2015 2 2 geological methodology the geological survey consisted of a regional geological mapping 1 100 000 scale of the whole río clarillo catchment fig 1c refining the previous geological maps in the area to assess controls on primary permeability since there is no consensus on the assignment of these rock units to the formal lithostratigraphic units in the area fock 2005 piquer et al 2021 thiele 1980 strictly lithological units were defined and mapped as for the controls on structural features on secondary permeability faults folds and fracture zones were surveyed at a finer scale focusing on fracture systems along the riverbed and on hilltops where rock outcrops are observed 2 3 geophysical methods the geophysical study involves the joint use of a uav based aeromagnetic system with only limited previous applications in the andes sanhueza et al 2022 yáñez et al 2020 and on ground transect data obtained from ert and gravimetry as shown in fig 1c transect a a and the drone coverage are oriented east west to perpendicularly intersect the main structures present in the study site as the srfps is n s oriented see section 2 1 2 for a description of the geological context as shown in fig 1c a second roughly e w transect b b is also performed this transect is located 10 km northeast of the río clarillo catchment in the río coipo valley and was performed to gain insights on the geological structures on the eastern flank of the la obra pluton where the rough topography prevents the use of ground based geophysical methods along the primary transect a a furthermore having two parallel profiles allows a 3d view of the geology to be obtained n s along strike variations we use the same methodological approach in both transects the results of this second transect are presented in the supplementary material nevertheless their contribution to our geological interpretation of the study area is included in the discussion 2 3 1 electrical resistivity electrical resistivity tomography is an exploration method that measures the subsurface distribution of electrical resistivity with high resolution dahlin 2001 it can be used to detect water saturated areas and the depth of the contact between the sediment surface layer and the basement unit as well as to identify fracture and fault zones in the basement unit which show lower resistivity compared to the surrounding unfractured rock as the ert method has optimal definition in the shallow subsurface it is limited to depths of around 250 300 m depending on the dipole separation data were acquired using an abem terrameter ls2 guideline geo stockholm sweden the measurement protocol involved a dipole dipole array with 48 electrodes and a 20 m inter electrode spacing each profile was 1 km long with an investigation depth of about 250 350 m the dipole dipole array was chosen for its particularly good definition of the vertical structures typically present in faults and geological layers loke 2004 samouelian et al 2005 the río clarillo and río coipo transects are respectively composed of six and seven profiles the former having fewer profiles due to field conditions both transects present a 500 m overlap between each profile to obtain a better characterization of the structures the apparent resistivity datasets obtained in the field for each profile were inverted separately to obtain 2d resistivity cross sections the data were inverted using the zonres2d software kaminsky 2010 each profile was then stitched to the adjacent one to obtain the full transect using the stitching tool in the oasis montaj software seequent christchurch new zealand this stitching method is necessary to obtain the full length transect without noticeable edge effects at the extremes of the profiles 2 3 2 gravimetry gravimetry measures the gravity field caused by differences in mass distribution below the surface variations in the residual gravity anomaly i e the difference between properly corrected gravity observations and the regional field see a description of this process later in this section can be indirectly associated with the subsurface density distribution which can in turn be used to infer geological information along the measured profile we used a cg 5 autograv relative gravimeter scintrex concord on canada with a resolution of 5 μgal and a trimble r4 gnss trimble westminster co usa receiver that gives the position and altitude with a precision of less than 30 cm the río clarillo transect a a has 56 gravimetric stations spaced 50 m apart along a 2 5 km long profile fig 1c the río coipo transect b b presents 72 gravimetric stations spaced 100 m apart along a 7 km long profile fig 1c gravity data were corrected using standard procedures telford et al 1990 1 the tidal correction is computed by the instrument during all the measurements and the drift correction is estimated as a linear function during the day with measurements at the base station at the beginning and end of the day 2 the latitude correction was computed using the wgs84 reference ellipsoid 3 the absolute gravity value was obtained using the base station at the department of geophysics of the university of chile universidad de chile gravity dgf 979 416 07 mgal 4 the free air and bouguer corrections were computed using the altitude obtained from the differential gnss and assuming a mean subsurface density of 2 67 g cm3 and 5 the terrain correction was calculated with a high resolution digital terrain model with a 5 m resolution aw3d standard product acquired from ntt data corporation finally the regional effect was removed to obtain the residual anomaly along the profile due to the effect of the low density bodies under the principal cordillera at deeper crustal levels for this purpose the bouguer anomaly of santiago obtained by yáñez et al 2015 was removed from our data then the result was processed using the rock measurement performed at a point of zero anomaly as a constraint after correcting the gravity observations we obtained a residual gravity anomaly suitable for geologically constrained gravity modelling the modelling process consisted of a forward modelling using the modelvision software encom with the model output being compared to the residual gravity anomaly 2 3 3 uav based magnetic survey in the magnetic method the magnetic properties of rocks are measured using a magnetometer it provides a valuable tool to map geology and structural networks if they involve magnetic contrasts the operational simplicity of total field magnetometers in which the magnetic field is recorded almost instantaneously regardless of the sensor or platform orientation make them very suitable for use in mobile platforms such as airplanes ships or uavs we used a bartington mag03 fluxgate magnetometer bartington instruments oxon united kingdom with three orthogonal components mounted on a uav system we surveyed one block see spatial distribution in fig 1c purple polygon the polygon is 6 600 m long and 1 800 m wide covering large parts of the reserve and both side contacts of the intrusive unit lines were flown in the n s direction with a line separation of 200 m and a flight altitude of 50 80 m above terrain level the location was recorded with a standard gps with an accuracy of 5 m the following corrections were applied to the raw magnetic field observations 1 removal of diurnal variations 2 removal of the earth s magnetic field igrf international geomagnetic reference field and 3 recovery of the total magnetic field from the three component fluxgate magnetometer for details see sanhueza et al 2022 after data correction we obtained a residual magnetic field dominated by magnetic sources in the shallow crust the data were then reduced to the magnetic pole rtp an approach which aims to centre anomalies over their source blakely 1995 the magnetic data were then interpreted qualitatively by comparing the rtp map with geological hydraulic and additional geophysical information 2 4 streamflow measurements remote sensing data and hydric markers the streamflow rate was measured from the outlet of the national park up to the confluence of the two main tributaries of the río clarillo 9 km further upstream fig 1b the measurements were carried out at least every kilometre and when possible at smaller intervals in the sectors of interest that is where the flow exhibited significant variation data were acquired with an acoustic doppler velocimeter flowtracker sontek three campaigns were completed during the 2019 recession period austral autumn to better evidence the contribution of groundwater to the baseflow the first and third campaigns are complete campaign from the outlet p0 to the confluence p8 while the second campaign is simply a small scale campaign between points p4 and p5 if the streamflow measurements cannot be quantitatively compared between each campaign the three campaigns exhibit similar trends and features and can serve as cross validation some data points are missing due to technical logistical or staff complications on site e g point p5 during the third campaign we also considered different types of soft hydric data i e qualitative data which are essential in ungauged catchments seibert and mcdonnell 2015 the soft data were mainly obtained from the knowledge of the nearby community of pirque the testimony of park rangers and the authors observations during field campaigns to complement the streamflow analysis and to obtain a long term assessment of the streamflow dynamics and the persistence of possible resurgence zones we analysed ndvi time series the ndvi measures the difference between infrared and red light to quantify vegetation presence and density using reflectance bands it is the most common index used in remote sensing to understand drought processes gu et al 2007 2008 related plant water stress ballester et al 2019 katsoulas et al 2016 and to evaluate groundwater fluctuation and vegetation cover pan et al 2008 seeyan et al 2014 the ndvi was obtained from the modis mcd43a4 product schaaf and wang 2015 through the google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 from 24 feb 2000 to 31 dec 2019 that is covering the drought period and the previous decade 2 5 conceptual hydrogeological models we develop various conceptual hydrogeological models and discuss hypotheses in relation to the streamflow evolution through the catchment as argued later in section 3 4 the groundwater surface water interaction is highly likely to be related to geological discontinuities geological controls on groundwater surface water interaction are further reinforced by a parallel sensitivity study not shown here of baseflow evolution through the catchment to varying uniform recharge rates on homogeneous numerical models in which topography driven groundwater flows do not reproduce the streamflow measurements carried out in our catchment therefore the conceptual models differ mostly in terms of the drainage surfaces and geological structures involved in the groundwater surface water interaction the conceptual models are presented in detail in section 4 1 following the joint interpretation of data presented in section 3 4 to offer a more quantitative point of view the proposed conceptual models can be segregated by simple mass balance assuming steady state conditions with no storage in the soil nor in the aquifer a relatively low direct runoff coefficient considering the forest cover and relatively constant baseflow over the year the effective precipitation in each catchment defined as total rainfall minus actual evapotranspiration can be directly compared to the baseflow per drainage area i e what goes in goes out a mean yearly value for effective precipitation is estimated from ground based meteorological data for the period 1985 2013 as acquired by the park administration in the vicinity of the catchment outlet p0 fig 1 the estimated effective precipitation over the catchment in this period is close to 120 mm 3 results we successively present the results of the geological mapping for hydrogeological considerations the geophysical results and the results related to streamflow measurements and remote sensing analysis 3 1 geology strictly based on lithological characteristics fig 1c four rock units were defined and mapped in the studied area some of which were recognized in more than one stratigraphic position the first is an andesitic unit composed mainly of andesitic lava flows and hypabyssal porphyritic intrusives with minor andesitic tuffs and sandstones this unit was recognized west of the newly identified papagayo fault presented in the next paragraph and at the base and in the middle of this fault hanging wall the second is a sedimentary unit which is a sandstone dominated unit that also includes conglomerate lithic tuff and andesite intercalations and crops out discreetly in the footwall of the papagayo fault extensively in the middle section of its hanging wall and as a small wedge within its upper section the third is a stratified dacitic unit which is composed of brightly coloured dacitic lavas and tuffs recognized in the upper section of the papagayo fault hanging wall the fourth unit is a granitic unit composed of monzogranites syenogranites and granodiorites which outcrops in the western flank of the principal cordillera intruding the stratified volcanic and sedimentary rocks the structural features of the study area allow the recognition of two distinct structural domains the first is a western domain limited by the main trace of the west vergent san ramón fault and a newly identified n s reverse fault which here is called the papagayo fault fig 1c this domain shows tight short wavelength 2 4 km folds and minor inverse faults generating highly dipping strata the second domain is located to the east of the papagayo fault and shows low dips on the flanks of long wavelength 6 8 km folds however 2 km east of the papagayo fault a west vergent anticline is recognized in the hilltops affecting the andesitic and sedimentary units directly beneath the anticline faulting and fracturing is recognized affecting the granitic rocks outcropping along the riverbanks a detailed structural survey in this area showed a zone with a high fracture density with vertical and closely spaced ns and ew striking sets and minor inclined nw and ne striking sets criss crossed zone in fig 1c 3 2 geophysical study fig 2 presents the magnetic field reduced to the magnetic pole the advantage of this representation is that it tends to show a direct correlation between the magnetic anomaly and the causative magnetic source i e a positive correlation when the magnetic source is more magnetic than the surroundings and a negative correlation for the opposite case on this map we identify four zones mainly oriented north south going from west to east the first 2 000 m of the profile zone 1 presents a strong positive magnetic anomaly that is relatively homogenous in the ns direction inside this zone a short wavelength less than 200 m but persistent negative anomaly is observed at longitude 361 000e secondly in zone 2 between 362 000e and 364 000e we observe a negative anomaly with its larger amplitude in the northern half and tapering off southward this broad negative domain is followed to the east by another negative domain zone 3 of the same length and signal amplitude 60 to 80 nt but decreasing southward and westward the limit between zone 2 and zone 3 is a fairly linear positive ns anomaly around 364 000e finally zone 4 extends east of 366 000e and is characterized by a broad positive anomaly that seems to extend beyond the study area in agreement with the geological map the mineralogical composition of geological units and susceptibility samples taken from outcrops table 1 the magnetic sources associated with zones 1 and 4 represent volcano sedimentary units with mid to high contents of ferromagnetic minerals in contrast the negative magnetic anomaly of zones 2 and 3 can be associated with the intrusive body mapped in the geology this intrusive has a consistently more felsic mineralogy and low magnetic susceptibility with a clear negative contrast compared with the volcanic units in the flanking domains table 1 the sharp transition between magnetic zones 3 and 4 can be associated with the mapped contact between the intrusive unit and the volcanic unit at the eastern border of the intrusion meanwhile at the western limit of the study area we can identify a similarly sharp transition between zones 1 and 2 in good agreement with the contact between the intrusive and volcanic rocks we postulate that the positive anomaly at 364 000 e which separates zones 2 and 3 represents a fault that provided room for the emplacement of more mafic magmatism the andesites of the flanking zones 1 and 4 and or a path for hydrothermal circulation and secondary magnetic enhancement due to contact metamorphism this anomaly is hence associated to the newly identified papagayo fault which appears to be a large scale regional fault according to the gravimetric survey carried out in the río coipo catchment looking at the path of the river entering zone 2 going west we see a change in direction from e w to s n which may be another sign of the influence of this fault on the river network finally in zone 1 the relative negative anomaly at 361 000e may be related to a demagnetization of the volcanic rocks caused by the hydrothermal fluid circulation at the piedmont fault zone the río clarillo ert profile fig 3 can be separated into two well defined zones identified as zones 1 and 2 on the aeromagnetic map zone 1 is defined at distances of between 0 and 1 300 m along the profile where the environment is much more conductive than the other part of the profile 100 500 ω m versus more than 1000 ω m eastward in this zone there are some small wavelength heterogeneities 100 200 m that are relatively positive and tabular along profile distances of 200 400 m and 800 1000 m and a shallow sub horizontal negative anomaly along profile distance of 100 500 m magnetic zone 2 is partially represented between 1 300 3 600 m on the ert profile it contains a shallow 50 m depth almost continuous and relatively conductive layer 300 ω m above a resistant body 1000 ω m the geological interpretation is based on the locations of the two aeromagnetic zones the higher resolution of the ert profile compared to the magnetic data suggest the presence of a shallow layer of sediments overlying the volcanic and intrusive units zone 1 evidences a more conductive layer which likely represents the alluvions that cover the volcanoclastic rocks of the western flank of the study area the magnetic signal in this zone cannot be used to discriminate this sedimentary unit probably due to its low magnetic content the vertical conductive structure between 400 and 500 m and the horizontal thin layer between 0 and 400 m are likely to be associated with the location of the thermal spring as this really low resistivity can be associated with saturated sediments zone 2 between distances of 1 300 and 3 600 m the eastern portion of the ert profile occurs within the granitic intrusion and is covered by a thin layer of alluvial material the high and rather homogeneous resistivity underneath the thin conductive cover suggests that this intrusive is a relatively homogeneous unit that is probably cut by structures at distances of 2 000 m and 2 800 m along the ert profile even though no regional large scale structures are defined in this area piquer et al 2021 observed and mapped secondary structures inside the granitic intrusion at similar locations which supports our working hypothesis on the discontinuity of the granitic body these results indicate that these heterogeneities represent faults or fold axes in the geology associated with the domain of high electrical resistivity the gravity anomaly along the río clarillo valley transect fig 4 upper panel shows two distinctive sectors a western sector characterized by a relative negative anomaly 5 mgal between distances of 0 500 m along the profile to the east is a wide zone with a relatively steep gradient 2 mgal km between distances of 500 1 500 m along the profile the remainder of the profile between distances of 1 500 3 500 m shows a relatively flat gravimetric response at 2 5 mgal the proposed density model considers a background density of 2 67 gr cc as well as the structures and layers defined at the subsurface by ert and magnetic interpretations densities for intrusive and volcanic rocks are based on in situ rock sample measurements table 1 while sediment density is obtained from yáñez et al 2015 as shown in fig 4 upper panel the model response is in good agreement with observations and is thus a plausible solution that is consistent with geological observations low density and thick sedimentary cover above the volcanic basement explain the lower gravity of the western side the thickness of the sedimentary unit decreases eastward in line with the decrease of the amplitude in the negative gravity signal this sedimentary body represents the alluvial fan at the piedmont considering the interpretation of the ert profile the low resistivity zone at a distance of around 500 m is here represented as a fractured area in the volcanic unit and a low density area in the sediment layer 1 85 gr cc as seen on the ert profile as a low resistivity zone below 50 ω m this low density zone extends between distances of 0 and 400 m in the sediment layer and probably represents a clay dominated body associated with the thermal spring zone recognized in the area towards the east zone 2 an almost flat signal is modelled as the gravimetric response of the more felsic intrusive body 2 63 gr cc covered by a relatively thin layer of sediments in this zone the sediment cover is approximately 50 m which agrees well with the ert transect which shows a covering of intermediate resistivity material of a similar thickness at the contact between the two zones at a distance of around 1 300 m there is a small decrease in the gravity anomaly this negative anomaly is associated with a low density fractured zone this contact zone is associated with the fractures induced by the intrusive emplacement the fracture zone identified at a distance of 500 m could favour groundwater exfiltration creating a preferential upwelling flow according to the location of the thermal spring over this fault the proximity of the two fracture zones which are located at along profile distances of 500 m and 1 300 m and their similar vertical structure indicate that a joint fault system may be connected at depth and act as listric faults 3 3 streamflow measurements and remote sensing analysis streamflow measurements acquired during the 2019 recession are displayed with regards to drainage or upslope area fig 5 a few interesting features are observed first we observe a significant increase of the streamflow at point p1 grey triangles in fig 5 however this increase is not systematically observed within the same recession period orange squares in fig 5 second and most notably it exhibits a significant increase of approximately 50 within a 1 km distance between p5 and p4 p3 we interpret this variation as groundwater exfiltration as there is no significant increase of the drainage area and there is no affluent observed in the area or a superficial supply of any type snowmelt water bodies groundwater exfiltration has been observed in the carrizal area fig 1c by park rangers who have noted that water is usually seen disappearing in the river while they are going back up the río clarillo which is consistent with the lower streamflow rate from p4 to p5 additionally some hydric features are observed downstream of point p5 such as a permanent puddle about 50 m uphill and a curtain of dripping water on the east at the riverbank the persistency of the groundwater exfiltration is confirmed by the difference in ndvi between the carrizal area and the entire national park the carrizal area is displayed here as a strip 1 000 m in length and 500 m in width along the east side of the river where geological and hydric features have been observed over the period 2000 2019 the mean ndvi in the carrizal area was 0 57 while it was 0 36 in the entire national park the difference in ndvi between the carrizal area and the entire national park is almost systematically positive fig 6 indicating that the carrizal area has denser vegetation due to a higher water availability in conclusion both qualitative observations and quantitative data indicate that the groundwater exfiltration between p5 and p4 has persisted for at least the last two decades 3 4 joint interpretation of geophysical and geological results and hydraulic markers the interpretation of the magnetic map allows us to describe four north south zones the ert and the gravity transects overlap zones 1 and 2 and indicate a similar spatial extent of these zones which reinforces our results and interpretations moreover the thermal spring is identified using each of the geophysical methods indicating a relationship between this feature and the presence of a fault inside the volcanic unit the temperature of the thermal spring is about 23 c as the geothermal gradient is about 3 c 100 m in this region muñoz and hamza 1993 valdenegro et al 2019 it is possible to approximate at first order that this thermal source is fed along a 300 m deep structure at least which is supported by the ert interpretation and the gravity modelling both methods indicate that the thermal spring is likely associated to upwelling flow along a fault or fractures zone as seen on other locations along the andes in central chile figueroa et al 2021 our second hydraulic indicator is the increase of baseflow that was measured between points 5 and 4 this area was only monitored with a uav based magnetic study the contact between the volcanic unit at the eastern end of the reserve and the intrusive unit might be of significance for the increase of the river baseflow nevertheless the location of the increase in the river flow is not exactly located over the contact defined on the aeromagnetic map fig 2 according to the geological map the resurgence area close to the contact presents a pattern of local east west fractures criss crossed zone in fig 1c as seen at the western edge of the contact between the intrusive unit and the volcanic unit fig 4 a highly damaged zone engenders the structural control of water flows 4 discussion based on the various observations described in the previous section we first discuss the capacity of various conceptual hydrogeological models to explain the observed streamflow variations and hydric singularities we then discuss the differentiating aspects and novelty of the proposed multi disciplinary approach for characterizing groundwater flow patterns in mountain catchments and for identifying structural controls on groundwater flow patterns and surface water groundwater interaction 4 1 conceptual hydrogeological models we propose three different conceptual models based on the observed geological features first groundwater exfiltration between p5 and p4 p3 could simply originate from the local drainage of lateral hillslopes in the carrizal area which are partly composed of alluvial deposits model 1 of table 2 fig 7 however the carrizal area offers a very small drainage area 3 km2 from p4 to p5 and 9 km2 from p3 to p5 which we argue is likely insufficient to explain the full extent of the resurgence second as the exfiltration occurs in the vicinity of the contact between the intrusive and volcanic units it could be related to a reduction of the groundwater seepage area that is a reduction of the active depth of the system due to a much less permeable underlying unit outcropping model 2 of table 2 fig 7 consistent with the results from section 3 2 in that case the drainage area could be the entire catchment area upstream of point p5 which is close to 100 km2 finally as shown on the geological map fig 1c and described in section 3 1 the carrizal area shows a large number of heterogeneities inside the intrusive unit it is described as highly fractured in relation to a local e w steeply dipping fault zone criss crossed zone in fig 1c and close to the n s major papagayo fault this local fault zone and the associated water resurgence may be a local effect of the e w faults and the fracture network in this area with no influence of regional structures still it is likely that the principal n s structure is directly related to these e w faults forming a fault network with secondary structures perpendicular to the major one supporting evidence for this last model is provided by the very low streamflow from the nearest downstream tributary los bueyes green catchment in fig 7 with no significant streamflow increase measured at p2 the catchment contributing to this tributary is directly stroke by the n s fault identified by both the geological mapping and uav based magnetic results this n s structure likely exports groundwater of the contributing subcatchment to the identified resurgence area model 3 of table 2 fig 7 as presented in table 2 and above each conceptual model corresponds to significantly different drainage areas model 2 can be discarded as the estimated flow from simple mass balance as presented in section 2 5 is seven times larger than the resurgence flow in model 1 and model 3 the estimated flow is 0 22 and 0 90 times the resurgence flow respectively thus model 3 is the most likely scenario considering the drainage area of each sub catchment hypothetically a combination of models 1 and 3 might as well explain the resurgence processes considering the uncertainty in the simple hydrological balance presented in section 2 5 4 2 differentiating aspects and novelty of the approach this work presents a methodology to identify structural controls on groundwater flow patterns and surface water groundwater interaction the scope of the methodology is above all functional in the sense that it aims to identify the key geological structures for groundwater flow but in no way to characterize the entire geological framework this functional scope necessarily impacts the scale of the study which is neither at the fault scale for example there is no topological analysis of the faults zone nor at the catchment scale as the elementary bulk unit this functional scope besides impacts the methodological choices made following the informational content of well known data and technics as the current approach aims at linking geological structures to hydrogeological structures it is inevitable to acquire hydraulic related data for that aspect widely used methods based on dissolved elements environmental tracers water isotopes hydrogeochemistry are directly related to transport processes and hence to groundwater flow and hydraulic gradient however their inability to clearly identify local scale processes mainly due to mixing limits their use when addressing problems related to groundwater flow architecture as it is the case here on the contrary baseflow measurement is an easily accessible data that can be related to local flow processes as the resolution of spatially distributed measurements can be arbitrary fixed beyond this consideration streamflow is a variable of interest in various disciplines including hydroecology in that sense the comprehensive methodology proposed here could be easily extended to hydroecology or hydrobiology the novelty of the proposed methodology lies mainly in the innovative implementation of classical methods from various disciplines that are conjointly designed and iteratively carried out the geological study has been indeed conducted at multiple scales at a traditional main scale 1 100 000 and at a finer scale to incorporate some elements e g the n e secondary fracture zone that would confirm hydraulic observations it results in a hybrid geological map partly fed by hydrogeological considerations regarding geophysical surveys they significantly complement the multiscale geological mapping the inclusion of a second geophysical transect in the north of the study area transect b b n fig 1c confirms the general n s orientation and regional scale of some structures results presented in supplementary material meanwhile the uav based magnetic study performed here at high resolution in comparison to previous studies does not only provide valuable information in remote areas but also constitutes a unifying method allowing the creation of a coherent geological model thanks to its fast and large covering finally while spatially distributed streamflow campaigns are not commonly used in hydrology they have shown here to be valuable to identify and confirm critical features of the baseflow evolution within the catchment if spatially distributed flow measurements may seem tedious low cost instrumentation and recently developed optical methods could allow a systematization of measurements 5 conclusions we propose a comprehensive methodology to unravel geological controls on groundwater flow and surface water groundwater interaction in mountain catchments geological mapping on ground and aerial geophysics and hydraulic data are acquired to simultaneously image geological structures and their hydrogeological manifestations using the novel methodology we identify peculiar hydric behaviours in an ungauged andean catchment including a significant and localized groundwater exfiltration that seems to be imported from a neighbouring subcatchment and related to the presence of a regional n s fault and a secondary set of e w local faults the novelty of the methodology mainly lies in the innovative implementation of classical methods multi scale geological mapping spatially distributed streamflow measurements high resolution aerial geophysics this novel methodology is distinguished by its pragmatism in that it focuses on the geological structures that are the most significant for flow without aiming to characterize the entire geological framework the findings have significant implications for the management and monitoring of the study site as flow singularities such as the abrupt streamflow change that may strongly affect the biogeochemical conditions in the river like biogeochemical hotspots credit authorship contribution statement etienne marti writing

1748,mountain water resources are considered to be the world s water towers still despite their importance for downstream societies and ecosystems and their vulnerability to climate change they remain poorly understood it is the case in particular of mountain groundwater systems their complexity makes them difficult to conceptualize while their remoteness makes them difficult to study both observationally and instrumentally understanding mountain hydrogeological systems is mostly limited by the lack of characterization of the subsurface geologic framework and by the limited understanding of the role of geological structures on groundwater flow and on surface water groundwater interaction removing methodological barriers is therefore a necessary step for improving the understanding of mountain hydrogeological systems to tackle this problem we develop a comprehensive multi disciplinary approach to gain insights into the hydrogeological role of geological structures in ungauged mountain catchments the methodology consists of several complementary methods 1 geological mapping at multiple scales 2 a geophysical study including on ground electrical resistivity tomography ert and gravimetry transects and a uav based magnetic survey 3 hydraulic data including a 9 km long transect of streamflow measurements in the recession period the long term normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and varied hydric markers e g a thermal spring and a puddle the methodology is tested in the parque nacional del río clarillo an ungauged catchment in the andes mountains 130 km2 that is illustrative of the complexity of mountain hydrosystems featuring fault zones weathered zones intrusive rocks and volcano sedimentary successions an increase of approximately 50 in the streamflow is observed over a short distance of 1 km such a localized and significant increase in the baseflow is not related to any superficial supply and can only be explained by groundwater exfiltration based on the multiscale geological mapping and geophysical survey a regional n s fault and a secondary set of e w local faults are identified in the vicinity of the resurgence area which conjointly are likely to export groundwater from a neighbouring subcatchment up to the resurgence area downstream of the resurgence area no significant change in the baseflow is observed corresponding to the presence of an impermeable granitic pluton identified by the geological and geophysical mapping finally a fractured zone in the andean foothills is identified in the volcanic unit which coincides with a perennial thermal spring indicating upwelling flow and hydrogeological connectivity between the mountain block and the alluvial basin the results strongly support the ability of the proposed methodology to identify geological structures that substantially impact the evolution of the baseflow through the catchment the complementary multi disciplinary methods are used innovatively to infer the link between geological and hydrogeological structures the methodology does not aim to fully characterize the geological framework of the catchment but pragmatically focuses on hydrogeologically pertinent structures that may impact baseflow and consequently catchment management keywords structural geology uav based magnetic hydrogeophysics fault zone mountain aquifer groundwater surface water interaction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction interest in mountain catchments has been growing recently markovich et al 2019 and references within mountains serve as water reservoirs for downstream alluvial basins due to the heavy precipitation they receive immerzeel et al 2020 somers and mckenzie 2020 more than half of humanity depends on mountain hydrosystems for their water supply grêt regamey et al 2012 snow and glacier dominated hydrosystems supply more than one sixth of the world s population barnett et al 2005 human dependence on these systems is all the more critical as they are particularly vulnerable to climate change beniston 2003 huss et al 2017 viviroli et al 2011 understanding the functioning of mountain blocks and their hydraulic connectivity with anthropized basins downstream is thus critical for water resource management kamenik et al 2001 mcdonnell 2003 soulsby et al 2007 as well as for society s resilience to climate change hayashi 2020 viviroli et al 2020 furthermore mountain catchments constitute preserved spaces and biosphere reserves in some cases harbouring endemic or native species clarke et al 2008 freeman et al 2007 meyer et al 2007 and providing various ecosystem services egan and price 2017 however despite their importance mountain hydrogeological systems remain poorly understood bishop et al 2008 owing to their inherent complexity stemming from significant topographic climatic and geological gradients in particular the interplay of geology geomorphology and climate on groundwater flow and related variables is barely understood condon and maxwell 2015 gleeson and manning 2008 winter 2001 for example groundwater flow scale depth distribution markovich et

groundwater timescales jasechko et al 2016 and river ecology and biogeochemistry kolbe et al 2016 weyer et al 2014 the geological heterogeneity of mountain blocks related to multiscale fracturing lithological discontinuities weathering etc is likely to substantially control groundwater flow as significant gradients of the hydraulic conductivity induce flow anisotropy leray et al 2012 2013 flow channelling intercatchment flow fan 2019 and possibly groundwater exfiltration bense et al 2013 caine et al 1996 scibek et al 2016 although studies indicate that geological structures substantially impact groundwater surface water interaction schaller and fan 2009 and stream flowrate and regime most studies have focused on the role of climate and geomorphology condon and maxwell 2015 cuthbert et al 2019 gleeson and manning 2008 welch and allen 2012 the geological complexity of hydrogeological systems strongly impedes the generalization of in situ observations and site specific results and accordingly limits the development of unified hydrogeological frameworks markovich et al 2019 wilson and guan 2004 worse mountain hydrogeological systems remain mainly uncharacterized as their steep topographic gradients and remoteness strongly limit access and site instrumentation the scientific bottleneck regarding the understanding of the hydrogeological functioning of mountain groundwater systems is therefore above all a methodological gap the filling of which requires the improved characterization of their subsurface geologic framework bense et al 2013 markovich et al 2019 groundwater flow paths and origins in mountain catchments have traditionally been inferred using hydrogeochemistry water stable isotopes and environmental tracers such as noble gases and anthropogenic tracers alvarez campos et al 2022 baraer et al 2015 hilberg 2016 jung et al 2021 ma et al 2018 manning and solomon 2005 as they directly derive from flow processes these methods can theoretically compensate for the lack of direct observations of hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradients from standard hydraulic methods boreholes pumping tests ginn et al 2009 however because of water mixing processes they constitute integrative methods that remain poorly effective to differentiate between hydrogeological models at the local scale troldborg et al 2007 and to identify hydrogeologically pertinent structures in complex systems leray et al 2012 hence in the absence of end member waters with significantly different chemical signatures the deconvolution of tracers and hydrogeochemical data is extremely challenging water balance analysis is a straightforward method that has been mainly used for the estimation of water balance components and for closing the water balance andermann et al 2012 cochand et al 2019 hood and hayashi 2015 mcclymont et al 2010 however closing the water balance may be strongly impaired in small ungauged catchments where the large amount of data required is not satisfied as ground data are rarely available and remote sensing data are often too coarse acharya et al 2021 hobouchian et al 2017 longuevergne et al 2010 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 besides addressing the role of geological structures on groundwater flow and surface water groundwater interaction implicitly requires the selection of characterization methods that are able to image geological discontinuities that is those with a relatively fine resolution tens of meters in this context geophysics has emerged as a non destructive method to survey the subsurface at various scales and depths and in some occasions hydrogeological processes binley et al 2015 robinson et al 2008 electrical resistivity tomography ert has been widely used samouelian et al 2005 for soil moisture studies araya vargas et al 2021 the identification of groundwater aquifer geometry and the study of geological structures ball et al 2010 martos rosillo et al 2019 robert et al 2011 ert cross sections can be aligned to reveal resistivity contrasts resulting from geological structures and to construct a 3d representation based on previous geological knowledge figueroa et al 2021 gravity surveys can be performed at different spatial scales from local to regional and can identify tiny changes in gravity to obtain structural information telford et al 1990 gravity surveys are generally used to delineate the basement depth of sedimentary basins abbott and louie 2000 figueroa et al 2021 murty and raghavan 2002 yáñez et al 2015 however they can also be used to identify geological contacts and discontinuities that do not outcrop ruelleu et al 2010 while they can be used to image geological structures the abovementioned methods and many more geophysical methods are unable to image hydrogeological features without an additional hydraulic based constraint such as groundwater level water resurgences etc besides ground geophysical surveys of mountain catchments are limited by their remoteness which has raised interest in the use of aerial surveys so far aerial geophysical surveys have been conducted by helicopter or airplane for large scale studies 1 000 km2 focusing on major regional geological structures dumont et al 2021 hussien et al 2017 lopez loera et al 2015 reeves 2005 vittecoq et al 2019 yet the recent emergence of drones uav has offered a potential means to explore the subsurface framework at much smaller scales and more systematically thanks to their smaller clearance distances less than 50 m and closer profiles hydrogeology is fundamentally at the cross roads of various disciplines and multidisciplinary approaches have naturally shown their value for characterizing understanding and managing groundwater as the joint use of various methods makes it possible to more widely cover the parameters space kreamer et al 2021 regarding mountain catchments studies based on various methods became essential to develop a more in depth knowledge of hydrogeological systems and to propose new conceptual models of their hydrogeological functioning christensen et al 2020 manning et al 2021 markovich et al 2021 ruiz pereira et al 2023 somers et al 2016 however the choice of data that are informative and complementary enough and the interaction between disciplines that may not share the same approaches and perceptions are in itself challenging the main objective of this study is to develop a novel multi disciplinary approach to assess the hydrogeological role of geological features at the catchment scale in ungauged mountain catchments to do so we perform a thorough geological characterization through a multiscale geological mapping and ground and aerial geophysical instrumentation to accurately outline both the surface and the subsurface geological framework to clearly establish the impact of geological features and heterogeneity on hydrogeological structures hydrogeological information is retrieved from various sources and various data types including spatially distributed baseflow measurements the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and a thermal spring location and temperature the multidisciplinary methodology is designed to get a comprehensive understanding of the system and establish a causal link between geological and hydrogeological features which cannot be achieved by each of the methods separately the scope of this study is functional and pragmatical aiming to identify the key geological structures for groundwater flow but not the entire geological framework and focusing on a key hydrological variable which is the streamflow in the following section we present the application of the methodology to the parque nacional del río clarillo an ungauged mountain catchment in chile whose large geological heterogeneity is illustrative of both the scientific and methodological challenges to the analysis of mountain groundwater systems after presenting the results in section 3 we discuss the capacity of various hydrogeological conceptual models to explain the observed streamflow variations and hydric singularities as well as the differentiating aspects and novelty of the proposed approach 2 study site and methodology 2 1 study site 2 1 1 climatic context the parque nacional del río clarillo is an ungauged catchment with an area of 130 km2 located 35 km southeast of santiago 33 72 70 49 fig 1 a and b situated in a semi arid climate the park is suffering from the uninterrupted drought that has been affecting central chile since 2010 and had led to a decrease in precipitation of about 30 in this region garreaud et al 2020 though presenting significant interannual variability the average annual precipitation downstream of the park historically amounted to approximately 700 mm during the period 1990 2010 dmc 2023 however since the beginning of the drought it very often does not exceed 300 mm and reached 400 mm on very few occasions dmc 2023 accordingly observations by park rangers and technical studies niemeyer 2002 point at a severe reduction of the río clarillo baseflow of close to 75 still these observations should be interpreted with caution as they remain very sparse the río clarillo regime is pluvionival with streamflow maintained by snowmelt in the upper part of the catchment while snowmelt historically lasted up to the end of march the past few years have shown an earlier melting which rarely persists after january according to observations by park rangers 2 1 2 geological context the present day configuration of the andes of central chile is marked by the development of two margin parallel ranges the coastal cordillera to the west and the principal cordillera to the east separated by the central depression alluvial plain the study area is located on the western margin of the principal cordillera fig 1a and is uplifted by more than 2 000 m over the central depression by the cumulative displacement of the west vergent san ramón pocuro fault system srpfs armijo et al 2010 rauld 2002 the geology of the río clarillo catchment records the evolution of the western margin of the eocene miocene abanico basin fig 1c this includes the volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the extensional phase of the abanico basin the abanico formation oligocene miocene and the volcanic rocks that represent the tectonic inversion of the basin that is the miocene farellones formation charrier et al 2002 these stratified units are intruded by granitic rocks of the la obra pluton c a 21 ma fig 1c however at the scale of this work there is no consensus on whether the rock bodies outcropping in the río clarillo catchment should be assigned to these formal units fock 2005 piquer et al 2021 2017 thiele 1980 at the regional scale the abanico formation shows intense deformation of tight west vergent folds in the westernmost outcrops that gradually decreases towards the east to wide and open folds the farellones formation lies unconformably over the tight folds affecting the abanico formation in the westernmost outcrops showing less intense folding and becomes gradually parallel to the underlying abanico formation towards the east charrier et al 2002 fock 2005 scarce pliocene to holocene alluvial and fluvial deposits are preserved in the main fluvial valley and in tributary ravines from the mouth of the río clarillo valley alluvial deposits show a strong increase in thickness towards the central depression reaching a thickness of up to 500 m gonzález et al 2018 yáñez et al 2015 2 2 geological methodology the geological survey consisted of a regional geological mapping 1 100 000 scale of the whole río clarillo catchment fig 1c refining the previous geological maps in the area to assess controls on primary permeability since there is no consensus on the assignment of these rock units to the formal lithostratigraphic units in the area fock 2005 piquer et al 2021 thiele 1980 strictly lithological units were defined and mapped as for the controls on structural features on secondary permeability faults folds and fracture zones were surveyed at a finer scale focusing on fracture systems along the riverbed and on hilltops where rock outcrops are observed 2 3 geophysical methods the geophysical study involves the joint use of a uav based aeromagnetic system with only limited previous applications in the andes sanhueza et al 2022 yáñez et al 2020 and on ground transect data obtained from ert and gravimetry as shown in fig 1c transect a a and the drone coverage are oriented east west to perpendicularly intersect the main structures present in the study site as the srfps is n s oriented see section 2 1 2 for a description of the geological context as shown in fig 1c a second roughly e w transect b b is also performed this transect is located 10 km northeast of the río clarillo catchment in the río coipo valley and was performed to gain insights on the geological structures on the eastern flank of the la obra pluton where the rough topography prevents the use of ground based geophysical methods along the primary transect a a furthermore having two parallel profiles allows a 3d view of the geology to be obtained n s along strike variations we use the same methodological approach in both transects the results of this second transect are presented in the supplementary material nevertheless their contribution to our geological interpretation of the study area is included in the discussion 2 3 1 electrical resistivity electrical resistivity tomography is an exploration method that measures the subsurface distribution of electrical resistivity with high resolution dahlin 2001 it can be used to detect water saturated areas and the depth of the contact between the sediment surface layer and the basement unit as well as to identify fracture and fault zones in the basement unit which show lower resistivity compared to the surrounding unfractured rock as the ert method has optimal definition in the shallow subsurface it is limited to depths of around 250 300 m depending on the dipole separation data were acquired using an abem terrameter ls2 guideline geo stockholm sweden the measurement protocol involved a dipole dipole array with 48 electrodes and a 20 m inter electrode spacing each profile was 1 km long with an investigation depth of about 250 350 m the dipole dipole array was chosen for its particularly good definition of the vertical structures typically present in faults and geological layers loke 2004 samouelian et al 2005 the río clarillo and río coipo transects are respectively composed of six and seven profiles the former having fewer profiles due to field conditions both transects present a 500 m overlap between each profile to obtain a better characterization of the structures the apparent resistivity datasets obtained in the field for each profile were inverted separately to obtain 2d resistivity cross sections the data were inverted using the zonres2d software kaminsky 2010 each profile was then stitched to the adjacent one to obtain the full transect using the stitching tool in the oasis montaj software seequent christchurch new zealand this stitching method is necessary to obtain the full length transect without noticeable edge effects at the extremes of the profiles 2 3 2 gravimetry gravimetry measures the gravity field caused by differences in mass distribution below the surface variations in the residual gravity anomaly i e the difference between properly corrected gravity observations and the regional field see a description of this process later in this section can be indirectly associated with the subsurface density distribution which can in turn be used to infer geological information along the measured profile we used a cg 5 autograv relative gravimeter scintrex concord on canada with a resolution of 5 μgal and a trimble r4 gnss trimble westminster co usa receiver that gives the position and altitude with a precision of less than 30 cm the río clarillo transect a a has 56 gravimetric stations spaced 50 m apart along a 2 5 km long profile fig 1c the río coipo transect b b presents 72 gravimetric stations spaced 100 m apart along a 7 km long profile fig 1c gravity data were corrected using standard procedures telford et al 1990 1 the tidal correction is computed by the instrument during all the measurements and the drift correction is estimated as a linear function during the day with measurements at the base station at the beginning and end of the day 2 the latitude correction was computed using the wgs84 reference ellipsoid 3 the absolute gravity value was obtained using the base station at the department of geophysics of the university of chile universidad de chile gravity dgf 979 416 07 mgal 4 the free air and bouguer corrections were computed using the altitude obtained from the differential gnss and assuming a mean subsurface density of 2 67 g cm3 and 5 the terrain correction was calculated with a high resolution digital terrain model with a 5 m resolution aw3d standard product acquired from ntt data corporation finally the regional effect was removed to obtain the residual anomaly along the profile due to the effect of the low density bodies under the principal cordillera at deeper crustal levels for this purpose the bouguer anomaly of santiago obtained by yáñez et al 2015 was removed from our data then the result was processed using the rock measurement performed at a point of zero anomaly as a constraint after correcting the gravity observations we obtained a residual gravity anomaly suitable for geologically constrained gravity modelling the modelling process consisted of a forward modelling using the modelvision software encom with the model output being compared to the residual gravity anomaly 2 3 3 uav based magnetic survey in the magnetic method the magnetic properties of rocks are measured using a magnetometer it provides a valuable tool to map geology and structural networks if they involve magnetic contrasts the operational simplicity of total field magnetometers in which the magnetic field is recorded almost instantaneously regardless of the sensor or platform orientation make them very suitable for use in mobile platforms such as airplanes ships or uavs we used a bartington mag03 fluxgate magnetometer bartington instruments oxon united kingdom with three orthogonal components mounted on a uav system we surveyed one block see spatial distribution in fig 1c purple polygon the polygon is 6 600 m long and 1 800 m wide covering large parts of the reserve and both side contacts of the intrusive unit lines were flown in the n s direction with a line separation of 200 m and a flight altitude of 50 80 m above terrain level the location was recorded with a standard gps with an accuracy of 5 m the following corrections were applied to the raw magnetic field observations 1 removal of diurnal variations 2 removal of the earth s magnetic field igrf international geomagnetic reference field and 3 recovery of the total magnetic field from the three component fluxgate magnetometer for details see sanhueza et al 2022 after data correction we obtained a residual magnetic field dominated by magnetic sources in the shallow crust the data were then reduced to the magnetic pole rtp an approach which aims to centre anomalies over their source blakely 1995 the magnetic data were then interpreted qualitatively by comparing the rtp map with geological hydraulic and additional geophysical information 2 4 streamflow measurements remote sensing data and hydric markers the streamflow rate was measured from the outlet of the national park up to the confluence of the two main tributaries of the río clarillo 9 km further upstream fig 1b the measurements were carried out at least every kilometre and when possible at smaller intervals in the sectors of interest that is where the flow exhibited significant variation data were acquired with an acoustic doppler velocimeter flowtracker sontek three campaigns were completed during the 2019 recession period austral autumn to better evidence the contribution of groundwater to the baseflow the first and third campaigns are complete campaign from the outlet p0 to the confluence p8 while the second campaign is simply a small scale campaign between points p4 and p5 if the streamflow measurements cannot be quantitatively compared between each campaign the three campaigns exhibit similar trends and features and can serve as cross validation some data points are missing due to technical logistical or staff complications on site e g point p5 during the third campaign we also considered different types of soft hydric data i e qualitative data which are essential in ungauged catchments seibert and mcdonnell 2015 the soft data were mainly obtained from the knowledge of the nearby community of pirque the testimony of park rangers and the authors observations during field campaigns to complement the streamflow analysis and to obtain a long term assessment of the streamflow dynamics and the persistence of possible resurgence zones we analysed ndvi time series the ndvi measures the difference between infrared and red light to quantify vegetation presence and density using reflectance bands it is the most common index used in remote sensing to understand drought processes gu et al 2007 2008 related plant water stress ballester et al 2019 katsoulas et al 2016 and to evaluate groundwater fluctuation and vegetation cover pan et al 2008 seeyan et al 2014 the ndvi was obtained from the modis mcd43a4 product schaaf and wang 2015 through the google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 from 24 feb 2000 to 31 dec 2019 that is covering the drought period and the previous decade 2 5 conceptual hydrogeological models we develop various conceptual hydrogeological models and discuss hypotheses in relation to the streamflow evolution through the catchment as argued later in section 3 4 the groundwater surface water interaction is highly likely to be related to geological discontinuities geological controls on groundwater surface water interaction are further reinforced by a parallel sensitivity study not shown here of baseflow evolution through the catchment to varying uniform recharge rates on homogeneous numerical models in which topography driven groundwater flows do not reproduce the streamflow measurements carried out in our catchment therefore the conceptual models differ mostly in terms of the drainage surfaces and geological structures involved in the groundwater surface water interaction the conceptual models are presented in detail in section 4 1 following the joint interpretation of data presented in section 3 4 to offer a more quantitative point of view the proposed conceptual models can be segregated by simple mass balance assuming steady state conditions with no storage in the soil nor in the aquifer a relatively low direct runoff coefficient considering the forest cover and relatively constant baseflow over the year the effective precipitation in each catchment defined as total rainfall minus actual evapotranspiration can be directly compared to the baseflow per drainage area i e what goes in goes out a mean yearly value for effective precipitation is estimated from ground based meteorological data for the period 1985 2013 as acquired by the park administration in the vicinity of the catchment outlet p0 fig 1 the estimated effective precipitation over the catchment in this period is close to 120 mm 3 results we successively present the results of the geological mapping for hydrogeological considerations the geophysical results and the results related to streamflow measurements and remote sensing analysis 3 1 geology strictly based on lithological characteristics fig 1c four rock units were defined and mapped in the studied area some of which were recognized in more than one stratigraphic position the first is an andesitic unit composed mainly of andesitic lava flows and hypabyssal porphyritic intrusives with minor andesitic tuffs and sandstones this unit was recognized west of the newly identified papagayo fault presented in the next paragraph and at the base and in the middle of this fault hanging wall the second is a sedimentary unit which is a sandstone dominated unit that also includes conglomerate lithic tuff and andesite intercalations and crops out discreetly in the footwall of the papagayo fault extensively in the middle section of its hanging wall and as a small wedge within its upper section the third is a stratified dacitic unit which is composed of brightly coloured dacitic lavas and tuffs recognized in the upper section of the papagayo fault hanging wall the fourth unit is a granitic unit composed of monzogranites syenogranites and granodiorites which outcrops in the western flank of the principal cordillera intruding the stratified volcanic and sedimentary rocks the structural features of the study area allow the recognition of two distinct structural domains the first is a western domain limited by the main trace of the west vergent san ramón fault and a newly identified n s reverse fault which here is called the papagayo fault fig 1c this domain shows tight short wavelength 2 4 km folds and minor inverse faults generating highly dipping strata the second domain is located to the east of the papagayo fault and shows low dips on the flanks of long wavelength 6 8 km folds however 2 km east of the papagayo fault a west vergent anticline is recognized in the hilltops affecting the andesitic and sedimentary units directly beneath the anticline faulting and fracturing is recognized affecting the granitic rocks outcropping along the riverbanks a detailed structural survey in this area showed a zone with a high fracture density with vertical and closely spaced ns and ew striking sets and minor inclined nw and ne striking sets criss crossed zone in fig 1c 3 2 geophysical study fig 2 presents the magnetic field reduced to the magnetic pole the advantage of this representation is that it tends to show a direct correlation between the magnetic anomaly and the causative magnetic source i e a positive correlation when the magnetic source is more magnetic than the surroundings and a negative correlation for the opposite case on this map we identify four zones mainly oriented north south going from west to east the first 2 000 m of the profile zone 1 presents a strong positive magnetic anomaly that is relatively homogenous in the ns direction inside this zone a short wavelength less than 200 m but persistent negative anomaly is observed at longitude 361 000e secondly in zone 2 between 362 000e and 364 000e we observe a negative anomaly with its larger amplitude in the northern half and tapering off southward this broad negative domain is followed to the east by another negative domain zone 3 of the same length and signal amplitude 60 to 80 nt but decreasing southward and westward the limit between zone 2 and zone 3 is a fairly linear positive ns anomaly around 364 000e finally zone 4 extends east of 366 000e and is characterized by a broad positive anomaly that seems to extend beyond the study area in agreement with the geological map the mineralogical composition of geological units and susceptibility samples taken from outcrops table 1 the magnetic sources associated with zones 1 and 4 represent volcano sedimentary units with mid to high contents of ferromagnetic minerals in contrast the negative magnetic anomaly of zones 2 and 3 can be associated with the intrusive body mapped in the geology this intrusive has a consistently more felsic mineralogy and low magnetic susceptibility with a clear negative contrast compared with the volcanic units in the flanking domains table 1 the sharp transition between magnetic zones 3 and 4 can be associated with the mapped contact between the intrusive unit and the volcanic unit at the eastern border of the intrusion meanwhile at the western limit of the study area we can identify a similarly sharp transition between zones 1 and 2 in good agreement with the contact between the intrusive and volcanic rocks we postulate that the positive anomaly at 364 000 e which separates zones 2 and 3 represents a fault that provided room for the emplacement of more mafic magmatism the andesites of the flanking zones 1 and 4 and or a path for hydrothermal circulation and secondary magnetic enhancement due to contact metamorphism this anomaly is hence associated to the newly identified papagayo fault which appears to be a large scale regional fault according to the gravimetric survey carried out in the río coipo catchment looking at the path of the river entering zone 2 going west we see a change in direction from e w to s n which may be another sign of the influence of this fault on the river network finally in zone 1 the relative negative anomaly at 361 000e may be related to a demagnetization of the volcanic rocks caused by the hydrothermal fluid circulation at the piedmont fault zone the río clarillo ert profile fig 3 can be separated into two well defined zones identified as zones 1 and 2 on the aeromagnetic map zone 1 is defined at distances of between 0 and 1 300 m along the profile where the environment is much more conductive than the other part of the profile 100 500 ω m versus more than 1000 ω m eastward in this zone there are some small wavelength heterogeneities 100 200 m that are relatively positive and tabular along profile distances of 200 400 m and 800 1000 m and a shallow sub horizontal negative anomaly along profile distance of 100 500 m magnetic zone 2 is partially represented between 1 300 3 600 m on the ert profile it contains a shallow 50 m depth almost continuous and relatively conductive layer 300 ω m above a resistant body 1000 ω m the geological interpretation is based on the locations of the two aeromagnetic zones the higher resolution of the ert profile compared to the magnetic data suggest the presence of a shallow layer of sediments overlying the volcanic and intrusive units zone 1 evidences a more conductive layer which likely represents the alluvions that cover the volcanoclastic rocks of the western flank of the study area the magnetic signal in this zone cannot be used to discriminate this sedimentary unit probably due to its low magnetic content the vertical conductive structure between 400 and 500 m and the horizontal thin layer between 0 and 400 m are likely to be associated with the location of the thermal spring as this really low resistivity can be associated with saturated sediments zone 2 between distances of 1 300 and 3 600 m the eastern portion of the ert profile occurs within the granitic intrusion and is covered by a thin layer of alluvial material the high and rather homogeneous resistivity underneath the thin conductive cover suggests that this intrusive is a relatively homogeneous unit that is probably cut by structures at distances of 2 000 m and 2 800 m along the ert profile even though no regional large scale structures are defined in this area piquer et al 2021 observed and mapped secondary structures inside the granitic intrusion at similar locations which supports our working hypothesis on the discontinuity of the granitic body these results indicate that these heterogeneities represent faults or fold axes in the geology associated with the domain of high electrical resistivity the gravity anomaly along the río clarillo valley transect fig 4 upper panel shows two distinctive sectors a western sector characterized by a relative negative anomaly 5 mgal between distances of 0 500 m along the profile to the east is a wide zone with a relatively steep gradient 2 mgal km between distances of 500 1 500 m along the profile the remainder of the profile between distances of 1 500 3 500 m shows a relatively flat gravimetric response at 2 5 mgal the proposed density model considers a background density of 2 67 gr cc as well as the structures and layers defined at the subsurface by ert and magnetic interpretations densities for intrusive and volcanic rocks are based on in situ rock sample measurements table 1 while sediment density is obtained from yáñez et al 2015 as shown in fig 4 upper panel the model response is in good agreement with observations and is thus a plausible solution that is consistent with geological observations low density and thick sedimentary cover above the volcanic basement explain the lower gravity of the western side the thickness of the sedimentary unit decreases eastward in line with the decrease of the amplitude in the negative gravity signal this sedimentary body represents the alluvial fan at the piedmont considering the interpretation of the ert profile the low resistivity zone at a distance of around 500 m is here represented as a fractured area in the volcanic unit and a low density area in the sediment layer 1 85 gr cc as seen on the ert profile as a low resistivity zone below 50 ω m this low density zone extends between distances of 0 and 400 m in the sediment layer and probably represents a clay dominated body associated with the thermal spring zone recognized in the area towards the east zone 2 an almost flat signal is modelled as the gravimetric response of the more felsic intrusive body 2 63 gr cc covered by a relatively thin layer of sediments in this zone the sediment cover is approximately 50 m which agrees well with the ert transect which shows a covering of intermediate resistivity material of a similar thickness at the contact between the two zones at a distance of around 1 300 m there is a small decrease in the gravity anomaly this negative anomaly is associated with a low density fractured zone this contact zone is associated with the fractures induced by the intrusive emplacement the fracture zone identified at a distance of 500 m could favour groundwater exfiltration creating a preferential upwelling flow according to the location of the thermal spring over this fault the proximity of the two fracture zones which are located at along profile distances of 500 m and 1 300 m and their similar vertical structure indicate that a joint fault system may be connected at depth and act as listric faults 3 3 streamflow measurements and remote sensing analysis streamflow measurements acquired during the 2019 recession are displayed with regards to drainage or upslope area fig 5 a few interesting features are observed first we observe a significant increase of the streamflow at point p1 grey triangles in fig 5 however this increase is not systematically observed within the same recession period orange squares in fig 5 second and most notably it exhibits a significant increase of approximately 50 within a 1 km distance between p5 and p4 p3 we interpret this variation as groundwater exfiltration as there is no significant increase of the drainage area and there is no affluent observed in the area or a superficial supply of any type snowmelt water bodies groundwater exfiltration has been observed in the carrizal area fig 1c by park rangers who have noted that water is usually seen disappearing in the river while they are going back up the río clarillo which is consistent with the lower streamflow rate from p4 to p5 additionally some hydric features are observed downstream of point p5 such as a permanent puddle about 50 m uphill and a curtain of dripping water on the east at the riverbank the persistency of the groundwater exfiltration is confirmed by the difference in ndvi between the carrizal area and the entire national park the carrizal area is displayed here as a strip 1 000 m in length and 500 m in width along the east side of the river where geological and hydric features have been observed over the period 2000 2019 the mean ndvi in the carrizal area was 0 57 while it was 0 36 in the entire national park the difference in ndvi between the carrizal area and the entire national park is almost systematically positive fig 6 indicating that the carrizal area has denser vegetation due to a higher water availability in conclusion both qualitative observations and quantitative data indicate that the groundwater exfiltration between p5 and p4 has persisted for at least the last two decades 3 4 joint interpretation of geophysical and geological results and hydraulic markers the interpretation of the magnetic map allows us to describe four north south zones the ert and the gravity transects overlap zones 1 and 2 and indicate a similar spatial extent of these zones which reinforces our results and interpretations moreover the thermal spring is identified using each of the geophysical methods indicating a relationship between this feature and the presence of a fault inside the volcanic unit the temperature of the thermal spring is about 23 c as the geothermal gradient is about 3 c 100 m in this region muñoz and hamza 1993 valdenegro et al 2019 it is possible to approximate at first order that this thermal source is fed along a 300 m deep structure at least which is supported by the ert interpretation and the gravity modelling both methods indicate that the thermal spring is likely associated to upwelling flow along a fault or fractures zone as seen on other locations along the andes in central chile figueroa et al 2021 our second hydraulic indicator is the increase of baseflow that was measured between points 5 and 4 this area was only monitored with a uav based magnetic study the contact between the volcanic unit at the eastern end of the reserve and the intrusive unit might be of significance for the increase of the river baseflow nevertheless the location of the increase in the river flow is not exactly located over the contact defined on the aeromagnetic map fig 2 according to the geological map the resurgence area close to the contact presents a pattern of local east west fractures criss crossed zone in fig 1c as seen at the western edge of the contact between the intrusive unit and the volcanic unit fig 4 a highly damaged zone engenders the structural control of water flows 4 discussion based on the various observations described in the previous section we first discuss the capacity of various conceptual hydrogeological models to explain the observed streamflow variations and hydric singularities we then discuss the differentiating aspects and novelty of the proposed multi disciplinary approach for characterizing groundwater flow patterns in mountain catchments and for identifying structural controls on groundwater flow patterns and surface water groundwater interaction 4 1 conceptual hydrogeological models we propose three different conceptual models based on the observed geological features first groundwater exfiltration between p5 and p4 p3 could simply originate from the local drainage of lateral hillslopes in the carrizal area which are partly composed of alluvial deposits model 1 of table 2 fig 7 however the carrizal area offers a very small drainage area 3 km2 from p4 to p5 and 9 km2 from p3 to p5 which we argue is likely insufficient to explain the full extent of the resurgence second as the exfiltration occurs in the vicinity of the contact between the intrusive and volcanic units it could be related to a reduction of the groundwater seepage area that is a reduction of the active depth of the system due to a much less permeable underlying unit outcropping model 2 of table 2 fig 7 consistent with the results from section 3 2 in that case the drainage area could be the entire catchment area upstream of point p5 which is close to 100 km2 finally as shown on the geological map fig 1c and described in section 3 1 the carrizal area shows a large number of heterogeneities inside the intrusive unit it is described as highly fractured in relation to a local e w steeply dipping fault zone criss crossed zone in fig 1c and close to the n s major papagayo fault this local fault zone and the associated water resurgence may be a local effect of the e w faults and the fracture network in this area with no influence of regional structures still it is likely that the principal n s structure is directly related to these e w faults forming a fault network with secondary structures perpendicular to the major one supporting evidence for this last model is provided by the very low streamflow from the nearest downstream tributary los bueyes green catchment in fig 7 with no significant streamflow increase measured at p2 the catchment contributing to this tributary is directly stroke by the n s fault identified by both the geological mapping and uav based magnetic results this n s structure likely exports groundwater of the contributing subcatchment to the identified resurgence area model 3 of table 2 fig 7 as presented in table 2 and above each conceptual model corresponds to significantly different drainage areas model 2 can be discarded as the estimated flow from simple mass balance as presented in section 2 5 is seven times larger than the resurgence flow in model 1 and model 3 the estimated flow is 0 22 and 0 90 times the resurgence flow respectively thus model 3 is the most likely scenario considering the drainage area of each sub catchment hypothetically a combination of models 1 and 3 might as well explain the resurgence processes considering the uncertainty in the simple hydrological balance presented in section 2 5 4 2 differentiating aspects and novelty of the approach this work presents a methodology to identify structural controls on groundwater flow patterns and surface water groundwater interaction the scope of the methodology is above all functional in the sense that it aims to identify the key geological structures for groundwater flow but in no way to characterize the entire geological framework this functional scope necessarily impacts the scale of the study which is neither at the fault scale for example there is no topological analysis of the faults zone nor at the catchment scale as the elementary bulk unit this functional scope besides impacts the methodological choices made following the informational content of well known data and technics as the current approach aims at linking geological structures to hydrogeological structures it is inevitable to acquire hydraulic related data for that aspect widely used methods based on dissolved elements environmental tracers water isotopes hydrogeochemistry are directly related to transport processes and hence to groundwater flow and hydraulic gradient however their inability to clearly identify local scale processes mainly due to mixing limits their use when addressing problems related to groundwater flow architecture as it is the case here on the contrary baseflow measurement is an easily accessible data that can be related to local flow processes as the resolution of spatially distributed measurements can be arbitrary fixed beyond this consideration streamflow is a variable of interest in various disciplines including hydroecology in that sense the comprehensive methodology proposed here could be easily extended to hydroecology or hydrobiology the novelty of the proposed methodology lies mainly in the innovative implementation of classical methods from various disciplines that are conjointly designed and iteratively carried out the geological study has been indeed conducted at multiple scales at a traditional main scale 1 100 000 and at a finer scale to incorporate some elements e g the n e secondary fracture zone that would confirm hydraulic observations it results in a hybrid geological map partly fed by hydrogeological considerations regarding geophysical surveys they significantly complement the multiscale geological mapping the inclusion of a second geophysical transect in the north of the study area transect b b n fig 1c confirms the general n s orientation and regional scale of some structures results presented in supplementary material meanwhile the uav based magnetic study performed here at high resolution in comparison to previous studies does not only provide valuable information in remote areas but also constitutes a unifying method allowing the creation of a coherent geological model thanks to its fast and large covering finally while spatially distributed streamflow campaigns are not commonly used in hydrology they have shown here to be valuable to identify and confirm critical features of the baseflow evolution within the catchment if spatially distributed flow measurements may seem tedious low cost instrumentation and recently developed optical methods could allow a systematization of measurements 5 conclusions we propose a comprehensive methodology to unravel geological controls on groundwater flow and surface water groundwater interaction in mountain catchments geological mapping on ground and aerial geophysics and hydraulic data are acquired to simultaneously image geological structures and their hydrogeological manifestations using the novel methodology we identify peculiar hydric behaviours in an ungauged andean catchment including a significant and localized groundwater exfiltration that seems to be imported from a neighbouring subcatchment and related to the presence of a regional n s fault and a secondary set of e w local faults the novelty of the methodology mainly lies in the innovative implementation of classical methods multi scale geological mapping spatially distributed streamflow measurements high resolution aerial geophysics this novel methodology is distinguished by its pragmatism in that it focuses on the geological structures that are the most significant for flow without aiming to characterize the entire geological framework the findings have significant implications for the management and monitoring of the study site as flow singularities such as the abrupt streamflow change that may strongly affect the biogeochemical conditions in the river like biogeochemical hotspots credit authorship contribution statement etienne marti writing

1749,hot springs in fault zones play a critical role in studying the structural effects on the evolution of geothermal systems the northern red river fault zone lies in the western part of yunnan southwest china with hot springs ranging from low medium to high temperatures from 2013 to 2019 thirty water samples were collected to analyze hydrochemical characteristics and structural effects the hydrochemical compositions of hot springs mainly come from the weathering or dissolution of the carbonate evaporite and silicate minerals and the cation exchange high contents of f and si in the hot springs of high temperature enhance water rock interactions for hot springs along faults there is a positive correlation between tds and circulation depth li cl ratios show that geothermal waters have three reservoir sources of different depths hot spring waters from shallower reservoirs are mainly ca so4 or ca hco3 type and those from deeper reservoirs are na hco3 type hydrochemical compositions of the hot springs are controlled by faults in terms of circulation depth and geothermal reservoirs hot spring waters are mixed with the proportions of cold water ranging from 60 to 90 the hot springs with varying mixing ratios may indicate the heterogeneity of fault networks and different reservoir sources this study underlines the hydrochemical evolution of geothermal water along faults with key implications for the understanding and exploitation of geothermal systems in the fault zone and similar regions keywords hot spring isotope hydrochemistry geothermal water red river fault zone data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as natural outlets of geothermal waters hot springs hydrochemical and isotopic compositions can reflect the hydrogeological features of geothermal systems naik et al 2002 ferguson and grasby 2011 karimi et al 2017 larsen et al 2001 analyzed the major ion chemistry and stable isotopes which concluded that the springs and seeps originate from the hydrogeologic compartments in the tecopa basin usa sasaki et al 2021 analyzed the hydrochemical compositions of hot springs and found that the concentration of ions corresponds to higher subsurface temperatures in the toyama prefecture japan li and cl as conservative elements are hardly affected by precipitation and adsorption their relationships are typically stable which makes them useful for tracing the sources of geothermal waters giggenbach 1991 sánchez et al 2013 high permeability pathways commonly associated with faults can be conduits for deep derived fluids due to lower pressure along them mailloux et al 1999 sibson 2000 blomgren 2016 zucchi 2020 there are many studies about structure controls on geochemistry and isotope signatures of geothermal waters johnson et al 2013 found that geothermal wells with abnormal temperatures are consistent with structural boundaries based on measurements of groundwater chemical isotopic and thermal properties of 120 wells in the southeastern espinola basin new mexico sánchez et al 2013 determined that the hydrochemical evolution of geothermal water in the villarrica chihuio area of the south andes is strongly dependent on structurally controlled heat transfer mechanism based on faults volcanic activities lithologies and geochemical characteristics of hot springs wrage et al 2017 found that fault kinematics and geometry fundamentally control geothermal waters in the southern volcanic zone of chile by using the relationships between hydrochemical type and cl b ratios and trace metals tectonic activities determine fault geometry and kinematics and a study of their relationships with hydrochemical compositions may be of great significance for understanding the evolution of hydrothermal systems in fault zones the northern red river fault zone lies in the western part of yunnan southwest china with more than 200 hot springs occurrence which is a suitable study area xiang and zhou 2001 hot springs of high temperature commonly occur along with faults in the non magmatic activity areas previous studies of hot springs in these areas have focused either on the hydrochemical characteristics and isotope compositions peng and jones 2013 zhenhua et al 2018 wu et al 2021 or related to the seismic activities zhou et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 despite these advances few studies have been conducted on the role of faults in controlling hot springs in the study area and the heat sources and groundwater circulation need further investigation and analysis to clarify the control effect of faults on the geothermal system evolution this paper examines the major ions and trace elements hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o of hot springs and geothermal wells this study aims to 1 identify the origin of the hydrochemical compositions 2 investigate the evolution of the hydrochemical types 3 summarize the links between hydrochemical parameters of hot springs and structural features the results will be helpful in understanding the hydrological features of geothermal systems and provide insights into the relationships between tectonic activities and geothermal systems by clarifying the role of faults in the formation of hot springs and examining the evolution process of geothermal systems it is of great significance to guide the exploration of geothermal resources of high temperature in the fault zone and similar regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 geological setting the red river fault zone is a strike slip fault zone formed by the plate collision and is the tectonic boundary between the indosinian block and the yangtze block lyu et al 2020 fig 1 a the strata are almost fully exposed except for the neo proterozoic sinian and lower paleozoic cambrian the cenozoic strata are mainly composed of sand gravel and conglomerate the mesozoic rocks are mainly sandstone limestone dolomite and shale the main lithologies in paleozoic strata are limestone dolomite shale and basalt the paleo proterozoic strata are metamorphic rocks fig 1b fig 2 the red river fault zone was still active during the neotectonic period which can be judged by the mountain ridges river systems marked dislocations and near horizontal scratches on the fracture surface allen et al 1984 schoenbohm et al 2006 based on the focal mechanism solutions of earthquakes the kinematic properties and dynamic mechanism of faults in the study area were analyzed zhu et al 2004 liu et al 2022 fig 1b the direction of the p axis maximum regional stress δ 1 is roughly in the nw direction the direction of the t axis minimum regional stress δ 3 is approximately in the ew direction zhu et al 2004 the modern tectonic stress field shows the approximately nw extrusion and ew extension along the red river fault zone wan 2012 the primary active faults in the study area are as follows fig 1b fig 2 longpan qiaohou fault lqf weixi qiaohou fault wqf lijiang jianchuan fault ljf heqing eryuan fault hef chenghai binchuan fault cbf and red river fault rrf the red river fault and weixi qiaohou fault are nw trending dextral strike slip faults xu et al 2021 they transformed from a sinistral strike slip in the early cenozoic to a dextral strike slip in pliocene leloup et al 1995 chung et al 1998 zhou et al 2022 the other three faults are ne trending sinistral strike slip faults or normal faults starting from the pliocene and similar to the most recent neogene movement of the red river fault wang et al 1998 2 2 sampling and analytical procedures six field investigations were conducted from 2013 to 2019 to collect water samples table 1 water samples were taken from the natural hot springs and geothermal wells and all thirty samples were collected processed and analyzed in the same way all samples were collected in 550 ml polyethylene bottles rinsed at least three times with the spring or well waters the water samples were sent to the beijing research institute of uranium geology and beijing institute of hydrogeology and engineering geology to conduct the chemical analysis water temperatures t were measured in situ by using a mik tp101 probe type digital thermometer and eh and ph with a mik ct 6821 portable ph orp meter elevations were determined by the mobile phone with the compass software k na ca and mg were analyzed by dionex ics 1100 ion chromatography cl f no3 and so4 by

software parkhurst and appelo 2013 the geochemical speciation analysis was performed and the selected minerals saturation indices si were also calculated 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical compositions physicochemical parameters and hydrochemical compositions of the water samples are summarized in tables 1 and 2 the ionic compositions and element concentration ranges of different hydrochemical types are shown in figs 3 and 4 all the samples can be divided into four groups table 3 based on the piper diagram the schoeller diagram and the multi rectangular diagram fig 3a 3b and 3c a ca so4 type waters b na so4 type waters c ca hco3 type waters and d na hco3 type waters the temperature ph and total dissolved solids tds of these four group waters vary dramatically table 3 fig 4a the concentrations of f and si are roughly positively correlated with temperature fig 4b the cl so4 hco3 diagram fig 5 is mainly used to interpret the major geochemical processes of geothermal fluids giggenbach 1988 the low cl and high hco3 or so4 concentrations place the geothermal waters close to the steam heated water field fig 6 a shows the spatial distribution of water samples related to faults one located in the lijiang jianchuan fault ljf four in the heqing eryuan fault hef seven in the wexi qiaohou fault wqf thirteen in the red river fault rrf fig 6b is associated with hydrochemical types among the thirty water samples three are classified as group a two as group b six as group c and nineteen as group d the group a waters ca so4 type are leaching from sandstone or limestone and dolomite of the triassic formation the temperatures of them ymd8 ymd9 and yxy2 are about 32 with tds above 1000 mg l and ph are calcareous to neutral table 3 as shown in fig 4a and table 3 the temperatures of group b na so4 type springs are similar to those in group a in which temperatures are relatively lower the hot spring yj2 of group b 1 na so4 cl type emerges from the quaternary sand and silt overlying the triassic sandstone the tds of yj2 is the highest among all the water samples the water in ye6 is na so4 type group b 2 which emerges from the quaternary sand and silt overlying the permian basalts and carbonate rocks compared with the group b 1 water ye6 has a little higher temperature similar ph and relatively lower tds the temperature of the steam of ye6 can reach 84 2 c the group c waters are ca hco3 type among them the ylj2 ye2 ye4 and ye5 are the group c 1 waters ca na hco3 type except for ylj2 which is directly exposed in permian basalt other waters ye2 ye4 and ye5 are exposed in quaternary sand and silt overlying the permian basalts and silurian carbonate rocks the average temperature ph and tds are 70 5 c 6 9 and 998 mg l respectively the group c 2 waters ca hco3 type ylj1 ymd7 are formed by leaching from sandstone and carbonate rocks of triassic and cretaceous ages compared with the group c 1 waters these springs have lower temperatures neutral ph and relatively low tds group d na hco3 type has three subgroups where the group d 1 waters na hco3 type occur in different host rocks sandstone mudstone shale carbonate rock basalt and metamorphic rocks the yj1 2 ye1 ye3 ye7 yyb1 yyb2 yyb3 yyb4 yd1 ymd4 ymd6 ymd10 1 and ymd10 2 waters belong to this hydrochemical type table 3 the average temperature ph and tds are about 49 c 7 1 and 1008 mg l respectively the group d 2 waters na ca hco3 type ymd1 ymd2 ymd3 and ymd5 emerge from the quaternary sand and silt overlying the permian basalts and carbonate rocks these hot springs have discharge temperatures of 38 1 to 57 4 c with ph between 6 7 and 7 2 and tds between 597 and 919 mg l the group d 3 water samples na hco3 type ye1 6 ye1 8 are taken from flowing geothermal wells tapping the limestone of the devonian age compared with the group d 2 waters these waters have a higher temperature alkaline ph and relatively higher tds the temperatures of these wells are the highest and so as the f and si contents fig 4a f and si are indicator elements in geothermal water and their concentrations roughly increase with increasing temperature fig 4b 3 2 stable isotope compositions the δ2h and δ18o values of the water samples are present in fig 7 a which are compared to the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 the local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 8 07δ18o 10 52 han et al 2022 and the soil water line swl δ2h 7 12δ18o 12 17 han et al 2022 the ca so4 type group a and the na so4 type group b waters show similar δ2h and δ18o values δ2h from 109 4 to 84 3 δ18o from 14 5 to 11 9 and lie close to the gmwl and lmwl the δ18o values of the ca hco3 type group c and na hco3 type group d waters show positive shifts with δ18o ranging from 17 to 9 1 and 15 7 to 10 3 respectively among them the δ18o value of ylj2 is abnormally positive furthermore the δ18o shift occurs in water samples in ljf hef wqf and rrf fig 7b and there are no positive correlations between δ18o values circulation depths and reservoir temperatures fig 7c the relationships between cl and δ18o are shown in fig 7d except that the cl value of ylj2 is too high the δ18o values of other water samples increase without the accompanying increase of cl 3 3 geothermometry the na k mg ternary diagram allows the judgment of the equilibrium state of geothermal waters giggenbach 1988 fully or partially equilibrated waters are both suitable for reservoir temperature estimation with caption ratio geothermometers all the hot spring samples belong to immature waters fig 8 which means the cation ratio geothermometers are not suitable according to previous studies wu et al 2021 a quartz geothermometer with no steam loss fournier 1977 is used here instead of other sio2 geothermometers the circulation depth of the geothermal waters is estimated by using eqs 1 and 2 which are 1669 m for the ca so4 type waters group a 1954 3870 m for the na so4 type waters group b 2314 3036 m for the ca hco3 type waters group c and 2415 4502 m for na hco3 type waters group d the circulation depth of geothermal waters can reach up to 4 5 km in the heqing eryuan fault and 4 km in the weixi qiaohou fault and the red river fault and only 3 km in the jianchuan lijiang fault 4 discussion 4 1 origin and evolution of hydrochemical compositions identifying the source of the hydrochemical composition of geothermal water is a prerequisite for analyzing its circulation and evolution the main geochemical processes originating the chemical compositions are listed in table 4 4 1 1 isotopic indicators of groundwater origin the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are commonly used as an indicator of the origin of geothermal waters krishnaraj et al 2011 the slope of swl is lower than lmwl fig 7a which is due to the evaporation of the stored soil water han et al 2022 most samples are situated along the gmwl and lmwl and above the swl providing evidence for an origin from meteoric water with little or no evaporation fig 7a the cl so4 hco3 diagram fig 5 shows that the water samples are of the steam heated type except for group b 1 which is the mixed cl so4 water it has been confirmed that there are salt bearing strata at a depth of 1000 2000 m which may be the source of relatively high cl in the hot spring of group b 1 yu 1997 zhenhua et al 2018 in fig 7b the high content of cl greater than500 mg l in the similar range of δ18o values is due to the dissolution of halite other than evaporation cl in group b 1 water is from the dissolution of halite the δ18o values of some hco3 waters show positive shifts with only minor changes in cl concentration which suggests that the soil waters do not contribute to the recharge therefore evaporation had little effect on the isotopic compositions of recharge water the excess δ18o may be due to the isotope exchange between groundwater and δ18o rich carbonate or silicate rocks clark and fritz 1997 capaccioni et al 2011 the degree of δ18o shift is related to the circulation path the residence time or the contribution of geothermal fluids mao et al 2015 the δ18o value of ylj2 is abnormally positive which needs further exploration 4 1 2 water rock interactions the hydrochemical compositions of groundwater depend on the weathering and dissolution of minerals appelo and postma 2005 therefore water rock interaction is the main process contributing to the hydrochemistry of hot springs the relationships between major ions and saturation indices are plotted to reveal these processes figs 9 and 10 the group a ca so4 type waters have ca mg hco3 so4 ratios equal to 1 which indicates that ca mg hco3 and so4 ions originate from the dissolution of calcite dolomite anhydrite and gypsum fig 9e table 4 the group b 1 na so4 cl type spring falls above the 1 1 line with the highest cl content among all the water samples indicating that cl comes from the dissolution of halite reaction 6 in table 4 and na has other sources except for group b 1 the contents of cl in other water samples are low less than5 meq l and the saturation indices of halite are less than 0 fig 9a therefore cl of the other groups are not from the dissolution of halite minerals possibly caused by mixing with atmospheric precipitation or other waters to produce trace amounts of cl as shown in fig 9b and 9f the excess na in group b 1 na so4 cl type and group b 2 na so4 type waters originate from the albite reaction reaction 3 in table 4 and cation exchange with na in or onto secondary silicate minerals kaolinite produced from silicate weathering farid et al 2015 the ca so4 and ca mg hco3 so4 ratios of group b waters are all less than 1 where the depletion of ca may be related to the cation exchange fig 9c and 9e as shown in fig 9c 9d and 9e group b samples are similar to group a in which the ca mg hco3 and so4 ions are obtained from the dissolution of calcite dolomite anhydrite and gypsum table 4 the silicate dissolution and cation exchange in group c 2 waters can be negligible fig 9b and 9f geothermal waters from group c 1 and group c 2 have ca so4 ratios that exceed 1 and the increases in ca concentrations are accompanied by the decrease in so4 fig 9b which indicates that there are other processes besides the gypsum and anhydrite dissolution the ca mg and hco3 in group c 1 and group c 2 waters may originate from the dissolution of calcite and dolomite as shown in fig 9b and 9f the water samples in group d 1 d 2 and d 3 have experienced different degrees of silicate dissolution and cation exchange resulting in higher na contents the yd1 ymd6 of group d 1 and group d 3 water samples have ca so4 ratios less than 1 where the excess of so4 relative to ca may be related to gypsum dissolution and the cation exchange resulting in the loss of ca fig 9c the calcite precipitation can also lead to the lower ca concentrations chae et al 2006 calcite precipitation can be confirmed by calcite saturation or oversaturation of the water samples from these groups fig 9j and 9 k ca so4 ratios of about 1 for other waters from group d indicate that the source of the above ions may be the dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite which is also confirmed by the linear relationship between the saturation indices and the sum of ca and so4 fig 9h and 9i the saturation indices of calcite and dolomite in groups d 1 d 2 and d 3 waters are close to 0 or greater than 0 except for yyb3 and yyb4 of group d 1 mixing of different groundwaters occurs near seepage zones and springs vents leading to the subsaturation of calcite even though the original water was saturated before mixing appelo and postma 2005 the lower temperature and tds of yyb3 33 168 mg l and yyb4 36 5 146 mg l compared with nearby hot springs also confirm the mixing with shallow cold water most of the waters are approximately saturated or oversaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite fig 9j 9 k and 9 l which may be due to co2 degassing or the common ion effect i e the dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite leading to calcite precipitation farid et al 2015 yang et al 2019 the calculated pco2 values are larger than the atmospheric one 10 3 5 atm which means that the co2 g input has other sources in addition to the atmospheric source possibly the degradation of organic matter in soils at depth acero et al 2015 the oversaturation with respect to calcite is attributed to degassing of co2 as it is negatively correlated with pco2 of water samples from groups c 1 d 1 and d 3 fig 10a minor elements in geothermal waters are useful in understanding the degree of water rock interaction göb et al 2013 al ameri et al 2014 these ions have higher reactivities in geothermal waters resulting in increased leaching from the host rock alçiçek et al 2018 as shown in fig 4b f and si concentrations are roughly positively correlated with temperature indicating that fluorite and silicate solubility increases with rising temperatures the relationship between the calcite saturation indices and the f concentration fig 10b suggests that calcite precipitation reduces the ca concentration promoting the dissolution of fluorite based on the above discussion the main geochemical processes controlling geothermal water evolution are summarized in fig 11 4 2 structural controls on hydrochemical compositions the hydrochemical compositions of hot springs and geothermal wells have been analyzed previously and their spatial distributions with respect to faults will be discussed to unravel the control effect in the development of geothermal waters the circulation depths of geothermal waters are related to fault permeability the relationships between hydrochemical compositions circulation depths and thermal reservoirs will be further discussed 4 2 1 circulation depths effects statistical correlations between hydrochemical compositions and circulation depths suggest a possible origin of hot springs since the circulation depths are estimated by multiple parameters from different sources eqs 1 and 2 there will be some errors in the results due to the mixing of shallow groundwater with geothermal water silica concentration will be diluted leading to an underestimation of the circulation depth fig 12 a shows na dominance in waters with deep circulation depth greater than 4000 m ca dominance in waters with relative shallow circulation depth less than 2000 m and others with intermediate circulation depth 2000 4000 m contain na or ca dominant waters which suggests that hydrochemical compositions are related to the circulation depth hco3 dominates in most hot springs group c and group d and contributions of so4 are more prominent in hot springs with shallower circulation depth there is a positive correlation between tds and circulation depth fig 12b indicating that circulation depth controls the hydrochemical compositions of hot springs 4 2 2 faults depths effects the tectonics are mainly nw trending and ne trending faults which are at an angle less than 90 to the maximum regional stress direction approximately nw direction fig 1b these faults are more likely to open up and form high permeability zones wan 2012 causing most hot springs located along the nw trending faults the faults provide pathways for groundwater circulation and connect the deep geothermal reservoirs faults can connect thermal reservoirs at different depths allowing for multiple sources of geothermal water li and cl are conservative elements whose relationships indicate common reservoir sources since their concentrations in geothermal waters of different origins often vary widely arnórsson and andrésdóttir 1995 yi et al 2021 as shown in fig 12c and 12d li is strongly positively correlated with cl in group d 2 na ca hco3 and hef waters r2 values close to 1 and weakly positively correlated with cl in wqf and rrf waters r2 values of 0 55 and 0 67 which suggests that springs controlled by the same faults originate from the similar reservoirs li cl ratios of the geothermal waters associated with faults have three trends fig 12d indicating that at least three reservoir sources hot springs from shallow reservoirs are mostly of ca so4 or ca hco3 type and those from deep reservoirs are na hco3 type waters 4 2 3 evolution of geothermal waters through different reservoirs mixing with shallow groundwater is one of the main processes affecting the hydrochemical characteristics of geothermal waters a silica enthalpy mixing model is an effective tool to evaluate the geothermal water component in mixed waters and to estimate the temperature of the geothermal reservoir based on the measured temperature and steam table data truesdell and fournier 1977 wolfgang and hans joachim 1999 belhai 2013 yi et al 2021 fig 13 the lines intersect the solubility curve of quartz and the intersection point gives provides the values of enthalpy which can be converted into reservoir temperature three lines between the geothermal waters and cold water indicate that they come from at least three geothermal reservoirs of different temperatures fig 14 for the springs geothermal waters in wqf the reservoir temperature is about 175 200 the reservoir temperatures of hef waters and some waters in rrf ye3 ye4 ye6 and ye7 are between 225 and 250 meanwhile the reservoir temperatures of the other waters in rrf are about 125 150 the reservoir temperatures vary widely along the same fault which may be attributed to the heterogeneity of faults tian et al 2021 compared with the reservoir temperatures calculated by the quartz geothermometer fig 7c the results herein are higher which means that geothermal water would be mixed with shallow cold water fig 14 from fig 13 the mixing of cold water in these waters is about 60 90 one of the possible explanations for the high mixing ratios is that the geothermal water is continuously mixing cold water from various pathways during its rising processes which is closely related to the permeability of the geothermal system controlled by the local scale fault networks fig 1b the control effects of faults on the hydrochemistry of hot springs have potential implications for the geothermal water evolution in other similar fault zones the development of fissures in the fault zone leads to more and longer groundwater flow paths the meteoric water in the recharge area infiltrates quickly along the fissures and is less affected by evaporation the hot springs with a deeper circulation depth have experienced a long time water rock interaction and thus have higher tds while li cl ratios are useful to study the source of hot springs it is necessary to combine the lithology of geothermal reservoirs and geothermal settings to understand the geothermal waters evolution from different reservoirs the conceptual model of the mixing process fig 14 can better explain the high proportions of cold water mixing in the hot springs this is of great significance to the simulation of geothermal systems and the exploration of geothermal resources of high temperatures in the fault zone and similar regions 5 conclusions the various hydrochemical types of hot springs are associated with the regional distribution of fault networks in the northern red river zone according to the hydrochemical compositions all the water samples are classified into four hydrochemical groups i group a ca so4 type waters ii group b na so4 type waters iii group c ca hco3 type waters iv group d na hco3 type waters ca and mg mainly come from the carbonate evaporite and silicate minerals weathering or dissolution k and na from the evaporate and silicate minerals dissolution and cation exchange hco3 from the carbonate and silicate minerals dissolution so4 and cl from the evaporite minerals dissolution anhydrite gypsum and halite the oversaturation of calcite is attributed to degassing of co2 high contents of f and si in the hot springs with increasing temperature enhance water rock interactions hydrochemical compositions of the hot springs are controlled by faults in terms of circulation depth and geothermal reservoirs for hot springs along faults there is a positive correlation between tds and circulation depth li cl ratios show that geothermal waters have three reservoir sources of different depths hot springs from shallow reservoirs are mostly of ca so4 or ca hco3 type and those from deep reservoirs are na hco3 type waters the hot spring waters are mixed with the proportions of cold water ranging from 60 to 90 the hot springs with varying mixing ratios may indicate the addition of cold water from different pathways which is related to the heterogeneity of faults in the northern red river fault zone the

1749,hot springs in fault zones play a critical role in studying the structural effects on the evolution of geothermal systems the northern red river fault zone lies in the western part of yunnan southwest china with hot springs ranging from low medium to high temperatures from 2013 to 2019 thirty water samples were collected to analyze hydrochemical characteristics and structural effects the hydrochemical compositions of hot springs mainly come from the weathering or dissolution of the carbonate evaporite and silicate minerals and the cation exchange high contents of f and si in the hot springs of high temperature enhance water rock interactions for hot springs along faults there is a positive correlation between tds and circulation depth li cl ratios show that geothermal waters have three reservoir sources of different depths hot spring waters from shallower reservoirs are mainly ca so4 or ca hco3 type and those from deeper reservoirs are na hco3 type hydrochemical compositions of the hot springs are controlled by faults in terms of circulation depth and geothermal reservoirs hot spring waters are mixed with the proportions of cold water ranging from 60 to 90 the hot springs with varying mixing ratios may indicate the heterogeneity of fault networks and different reservoir sources this study underlines the hydrochemical evolution of geothermal water along faults with key implications for the understanding and exploitation of geothermal systems in the fault zone and similar regions keywords hot spring isotope hydrochemistry geothermal water red river fault zone data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as natural outlets of geothermal waters hot springs hydrochemical and isotopic compositions can reflect the hydrogeological features of geothermal systems naik et al 2002 ferguson and grasby 2011 karimi et al 2017 larsen et al 2001 analyzed the major ion chemistry and stable isotopes which concluded that the springs and seeps originate from the hydrogeologic compartments in the tecopa basin usa sasaki et al 2021 analyzed the hydrochemical compositions of hot springs and found that the concentration of ions corresponds to higher subsurface temperatures in the toyama prefecture japan li and cl as conservative elements are hardly affected by precipitation and adsorption their relationships are typically stable which makes them useful for tracing the sources of geothermal waters giggenbach 1991 sánchez et al 2013 high permeability pathways commonly associated with faults can be conduits for deep derived fluids due to lower pressure along them mailloux et al 1999 sibson 2000 blomgren 2016 zucchi 2020 there are many studies about structure controls on geochemistry and isotope signatures of geothermal waters johnson et al 2013 found that geothermal wells with abnormal temperatures are consistent with structural boundaries based on measurements of groundwater chemical isotopic and thermal properties of 120 wells in the southeastern espinola basin new mexico sánchez et al 2013 determined that the hydrochemical evolution of geothermal water in the villarrica chihuio area of the south andes is strongly dependent on structurally controlled heat transfer mechanism based on faults volcanic activities lithologies and geochemical characteristics of hot springs wrage et al 2017 found that fault kinematics and geometry fundamentally control geothermal waters in the southern volcanic zone of chile by using the relationships between hydrochemical type and cl b ratios and trace metals tectonic activities determine fault geometry and kinematics and a study of their relationships with hydrochemical compositions may be of great significance for understanding the evolution of hydrothermal systems in fault zones the northern red river fault zone lies in the western part of yunnan southwest china with more than 200 hot springs occurrence which is a suitable study area xiang and zhou 2001 hot springs of high temperature commonly occur along with faults in the non magmatic activity areas previous studies of hot springs in these areas have focused either on the hydrochemical characteristics and isotope compositions peng and jones 2013 zhenhua et al 2018 wu et al 2021 or related to the seismic activities zhou et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 despite these advances few studies have been conducted on the role of faults in controlling hot springs in the study area and the heat sources and groundwater circulation need further investigation and analysis to clarify the control effect of faults on the geothermal system evolution this paper examines the major ions and trace elements hydrogen δ2h and oxygen δ18o of hot springs and geothermal wells this study aims to 1 identify the origin of the hydrochemical compositions 2 investigate the evolution of the hydrochemical types 3 summarize the links between hydrochemical parameters of hot springs and structural features the results will be helpful in understanding the hydrological features of geothermal systems and provide insights into the relationships between tectonic activities and geothermal systems by clarifying the role of faults in the formation of hot springs and examining the evolution process of geothermal systems it is of great significance to guide the exploration of geothermal resources of high temperature in the fault zone and similar regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 geological setting the red river fault zone is a strike slip fault zone formed by the plate collision and is the tectonic boundary between the indosinian block and the yangtze block lyu et al 2020 fig 1 a the strata are almost fully exposed except for the neo proterozoic sinian and lower paleozoic cambrian the cenozoic strata are mainly composed of sand gravel and conglomerate the mesozoic rocks are mainly sandstone limestone dolomite and shale the main lithologies in paleozoic strata are limestone dolomite shale and basalt the paleo proterozoic strata are metamorphic rocks fig 1b fig 2 the red river fault zone was still active during the neotectonic period which can be judged by the mountain ridges river systems marked dislocations and near horizontal scratches on the fracture surface allen et al 1984 schoenbohm et al 2006 based on the focal mechanism solutions of earthquakes the kinematic properties and dynamic mechanism of faults in the study area were analyzed zhu et al 2004 liu et al 2022 fig 1b the direction of the p axis maximum regional stress δ 1 is roughly in the nw direction the direction of the t axis minimum regional stress δ 3 is approximately in the ew direction zhu et al 2004 the modern tectonic stress field shows the approximately nw extrusion and ew extension along the red river fault zone wan 2012 the primary active faults in the study area are as follows fig 1b fig 2 longpan qiaohou fault lqf weixi qiaohou fault wqf lijiang jianchuan fault ljf heqing eryuan fault hef chenghai binchuan fault cbf and red river fault rrf the red river fault and weixi qiaohou fault are nw trending dextral strike slip faults xu et al 2021 they transformed from a sinistral strike slip in the early cenozoic to a dextral strike slip in pliocene leloup et al 1995 chung et al 1998 zhou et al 2022 the other three faults are ne trending sinistral strike slip faults or normal faults starting from the pliocene and similar to the most recent neogene movement of the red river fault wang et al 1998 2 2 sampling and analytical procedures six field investigations were conducted from 2013 to 2019 to collect water samples table 1 water samples were taken from the natural hot springs and geothermal wells and all thirty samples were collected processed and analyzed in the same way all samples were collected in 550 ml polyethylene bottles rinsed at least three times with the spring or well waters the water samples were sent to the beijing research institute of uranium geology and beijing institute of hydrogeology and engineering geology to conduct the chemical analysis water temperatures t were measured in situ by using a mik tp101 probe type digital thermometer and eh and ph

software parkhurst and appelo 2013 the geochemical speciation analysis was performed and the selected minerals saturation indices si were also calculated 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical compositions physicochemical parameters and hydrochemical compositions of the water samples are summarized in tables 1 and 2 the ionic compositions and element concentration ranges of different hydrochemical types are shown in figs 3 and 4 all the samples can be divided into four groups table 3 based on the piper diagram the schoeller diagram and the multi rectangular diagram fig 3a 3b and 3c a ca so4 type waters b na so4 type waters c ca hco3 type waters and d na hco3 type waters the temperature ph and total dissolved solids tds of these four group waters vary dramatically table 3 fig 4a the concentrations of f and si are roughly positively correlated with temperature fig 4b the cl so4 hco3 diagram fig 5 is mainly used to interpret the major geochemical processes of geothermal fluids giggenbach 1988 the low cl and high hco3 or so4 concentrations place the geothermal waters close to the steam heated water field fig 6 a shows the spatial distribution of water samples related to faults one located in the lijiang jianchuan fault ljf four in the heqing eryuan fault hef seven in the wexi qiaohou fault wqf thirteen in the red river fault rrf fig 6b is associated with hydrochemical types among the thirty water samples three are classified as group a two as group b six as group c and nineteen as group d the group a waters ca so4 type are leaching from sandstone or limestone and dolomite of the triassic formation the temperatures of them ymd8 ymd9 and yxy2 are about 32 with tds above 1000 mg l and ph are calcareous to neutral table 3 as shown in fig 4a and table 3 the temperatures of group b na so4 type springs are similar to those in group a in which temperatures are relatively lower the hot spring yj2 of group b 1 na so4 cl type emerges from the quaternary sand and silt overlying the triassic sandstone the tds of yj2 is the highest among all the water samples the water in ye6 is na so4 type group b 2 which emerges from the quaternary sand and silt overlying the permian basalts and carbonate rocks compared with the group b 1 water ye6 has a little higher temperature similar ph and relatively lower tds the temperature of the steam of ye6 can reach 84 2 c the group c waters are ca hco3 type among them the ylj2 ye2 ye4 and ye5 are the group c 1 waters ca na hco3 type except for ylj2 which is directly exposed in permian basalt other waters ye2 ye4 and ye5 are exposed in quaternary sand and silt overlying the permian basalts and silurian carbonate rocks the average temperature ph and tds are 70 5 c 6 9 and 998 mg l respectively the group c 2 waters ca hco3 type ylj1 ymd7 are formed by leaching from sandstone and carbonate rocks of triassic and cretaceous ages compared with the group c 1 waters these springs have lower temperatures neutral ph and relatively low tds group d na hco3 type has three subgroups where the group d 1 waters na hco3 type occur in different host rocks sandstone mudstone shale carbonate rock basalt and metamorphic rocks the yj1 2 ye1 ye3 ye7 yyb1 yyb2 yyb3 yyb4 yd1 ymd4 ymd6 ymd10 1 and ymd10 2 waters belong to this hydrochemical type table 3 the average temperature ph and tds are about 49 c 7 1 and 1008 mg l respectively the group d 2 waters na ca hco3 type ymd1 ymd2 ymd3 and ymd5 emerge from the quaternary sand and silt overlying the permian basalts and carbonate rocks these hot springs have discharge temperatures of 38 1 to 57 4 c with ph between 6 7 and 7 2 and tds between 597 and 919 mg l the group d 3 water samples na hco3 type ye1 6 ye1 8 are taken from flowing geothermal wells tapping the limestone of the devonian age compared with the group d 2 waters these waters have a higher temperature alkaline ph and relatively higher tds the temperatures of these wells are the highest and so as the f and si contents fig 4a f and si are indicator elements in geothermal water and their concentrations roughly increase with increasing temperature fig 4b 3 2 stable isotope compositions the δ2h and δ18o values of the water samples are present in fig 7 a which are compared to the global meteoric water line gmwl δ2h 8δ18o 10 craig 1961 the local meteoric water line lmwl δ2h 8 07δ18o 10 52 han et al 2022 and the soil water line swl δ2h 7 12δ18o 12 17 han et al 2022 the ca so4 type group a and the na so4 type group b waters show similar δ2h and δ18o values δ2h from 109 4 to 84 3 δ18o from 14 5 to 11 9 and lie close to the gmwl and lmwl the δ18o values of the ca hco3 type group c and na hco3 type group d waters show positive shifts with δ18o ranging from 17 to 9 1 and 15 7 to 10 3 respectively among them the δ18o value of ylj2 is abnormally positive furthermore the δ18o shift occurs in water samples in ljf hef wqf and rrf fig 7b and there are no positive correlations between δ18o values circulation depths and reservoir temperatures fig 7c the relationships between cl and δ18o are shown in fig 7d except that the cl value of ylj2 is too high the δ18o values of other water samples increase without the accompanying increase of cl 3 3 geothermometry the na k mg ternary diagram allows the judgment of the equilibrium state of geothermal waters giggenbach 1988 fully or partially equilibrated waters are both suitable for reservoir temperature estimation with caption ratio geothermometers all the hot spring samples belong to immature waters fig 8 which means the cation ratio geothermometers are not suitable according to previous studies wu et al 2021 a quartz geothermometer with no steam loss fournier 1977 is used here instead of other sio2 geothermometers the circulation depth of the geothermal waters is estimated by using eqs 1 and 2 which are 1669 m for the ca so4 type waters group a 1954 3870 m for the na so4 type waters group b 2314 3036 m for the ca hco3 type waters group c and 2415 4502 m for na hco3 type waters group d the circulation depth of geothermal waters can reach up to 4 5 km in the heqing eryuan fault and 4 km in the weixi qiaohou fault and the red river fault and only 3 km in the jianchuan lijiang fault 4 discussion 4 1 origin and evolution of hydrochemical compositions identifying the source of the hydrochemical composition of geothermal water is a prerequisite for analyzing its circulation and evolution the main geochemical processes originating the chemical compositions are listed in table 4 4 1 1 isotopic indicators of groundwater origin the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are commonly used as an indicator of the origin of geothermal waters krishnaraj et al 2011 the slope of swl is lower than lmwl fig 7a which is due to the evaporation of the stored soil water han et al 2022 most samples are situated along the gmwl and lmwl and above the swl providing evidence for an origin from meteoric water with little or no evaporation fig 7a the cl so4 hco3 diagram fig 5 shows that the water samples are of the steam heated type except for group b 1 which is the mixed cl so4 water it has been confirmed that there are salt bearing strata at a depth of 1000 2000 m which may be the source of relatively high cl in the hot spring of group b 1 yu 1997 zhenhua et al 2018 in fig 7b the high content of cl greater than500 mg l in the similar range of δ18o values is due to the dissolution of halite other than evaporation cl in group b 1 water is from the dissolution of halite the δ18o values of some hco3 waters show positive shifts with only minor changes in cl concentration which suggests that the soil waters do not contribute to the recharge therefore evaporation had little effect on the isotopic compositions of recharge water the excess δ18o may be due to the isotope exchange between groundwater and δ18o rich carbonate or silicate rocks clark and fritz 1997 capaccioni et al 2011 the degree of δ18o shift is related to the circulation path the residence time or the contribution of geothermal fluids mao et al 2015 the δ18o value of ylj2 is abnormally positive which needs further exploration 4 1 2 water rock interactions the hydrochemical compositions of groundwater depend on the weathering and dissolution of minerals appelo and postma 2005 therefore water rock interaction is the main process contributing to the hydrochemistry of hot springs the relationships between major ions and saturation indices are plotted to reveal these processes figs 9 and 10 the group a ca so4 type waters have ca mg hco3 so4 ratios equal to 1 which indicates that ca mg hco3 and so4 ions originate from the dissolution of calcite dolomite anhydrite and gypsum fig 9e table 4 the group b 1 na so4 cl type spring falls above the 1 1 line with the highest cl content among all the water samples indicating that cl comes from the dissolution of halite reaction 6 in table 4 and na has other sources except for group b 1 the contents of cl in other water samples are low less than5 meq l and the saturation indices of halite are less than 0 fig 9a therefore cl of the other groups are not from the dissolution of halite minerals possibly caused by mixing with atmospheric precipitation or other waters to produce trace amounts of cl as shown in fig 9b and 9f the excess na in group b 1 na so4 cl type and group b 2 na so4 type waters originate from the albite reaction reaction 3 in table 4 and cation exchange with na in or onto secondary silicate minerals kaolinite produced from silicate weathering farid et al 2015 the ca so4 and ca mg hco3 so4 ratios of group b waters are all less than 1 where the depletion of ca may be related to the cation exchange fig 9c and 9e as shown in fig 9c 9d and 9e group b samples are similar to group a in which the ca mg hco3 and so4 ions are obtained from the dissolution of calcite dolomite anhydrite and gypsum table 4 the silicate dissolution and cation exchange in group c 2 waters can be negligible fig 9b and 9f geothermal waters from group c 1 and group c 2 have ca so4 ratios that exceed 1 and the increases in ca concentrations are accompanied by the decrease in so4 fig 9b which indicates that there are other processes besides the gypsum and anhydrite dissolution the ca mg and hco3 in group c 1 and group c 2 waters may originate from the dissolution of calcite and dolomite as shown in fig 9b and 9f the water samples in group d 1 d 2 and d 3 have experienced different degrees of silicate dissolution and cation exchange resulting in higher na contents the yd1 ymd6 of group d 1 and group d 3 water samples have ca so4 ratios less than 1 where the excess of so4 relative to ca may be related to gypsum dissolution and the cation exchange resulting in the loss of ca fig 9c the calcite precipitation can also lead to the lower ca concentrations chae et al 2006 calcite precipitation can be confirmed by calcite saturation or oversaturation of the water samples from these groups fig 9j and 9 k ca so4 ratios of about 1 for other waters from group d indicate that the source of the above ions may be the dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite which is also confirmed by the linear relationship between the saturation indices and the sum of ca and so4 fig 9h and 9i the saturation indices of calcite and dolomite in groups d 1 d 2 and d 3 waters are close to 0 or greater than 0 except for yyb3 and yyb4 of group d 1 mixing of different groundwaters occurs near seepage zones and springs vents leading to the subsaturation of calcite even though the original water was saturated before mixing appelo and postma 2005 the lower temperature and tds of yyb3 33 168 mg l and yyb4 36 5 146 mg l compared with nearby hot springs also confirm the mixing with shallow cold water most of the waters are approximately saturated or oversaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite fig 9j 9 k and 9 l which may be due to co2 degassing or the common ion effect i e the dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite leading to calcite precipitation farid et al 2015 yang et al 2019 the calculated pco2 values are larger than the atmospheric one 10 3 5 atm which means that the co2 g input has other sources in addition to the atmospheric source possibly the degradation of organic matter in soils at depth acero et al 2015 the oversaturation with respect to calcite is attributed to degassing of co2 as it is negatively correlated with pco2 of water samples from groups c 1 d 1 and d 3 fig 10a minor elements in geothermal waters are useful in understanding the degree of water rock interaction göb et al 2013 al ameri et al 2014 these ions have higher reactivities in geothermal waters resulting in increased leaching from the host rock alçiçek et al 2018 as shown in fig 4b f and si concentrations are roughly positively correlated with temperature indicating that fluorite and silicate solubility increases with rising temperatures the relationship between the calcite saturation indices and the f concentration fig 10b suggests that calcite precipitation reduces the ca concentration promoting the dissolution of fluorite based on the above discussion the main geochemical processes controlling geothermal water evolution are summarized in fig 11 4 2 structural controls on hydrochemical compositions the hydrochemical compositions of hot springs and geothermal wells have been analyzed previously and their spatial distributions with respect to faults will be discussed to unravel the control effect in the development of geothermal waters the circulation depths of geothermal waters are related to fault permeability the relationships between hydrochemical compositions circulation depths and thermal reservoirs will be further discussed 4 2 1 circulation depths effects statistical correlations between hydrochemical compositions and circulation depths suggest a possible origin of hot springs since the circulation depths are estimated by multiple parameters from different sources eqs 1 and 2 there will be some errors in the results due to the mixing of shallow groundwater with geothermal water silica concentration will be diluted leading to an underestimation of the circulation depth fig 12 a shows na dominance in waters with deep circulation depth greater than 4000 m ca dominance in waters with relative shallow circulation depth less than 2000 m and others with intermediate circulation depth 2000 4000 m contain na or ca dominant waters which suggests that hydrochemical compositions are related to the circulation depth hco3 dominates in most hot springs group c and group d and contributions of so4 are more prominent in hot springs with shallower circulation depth there is a positive correlation between tds and circulation depth fig 12b indicating that circulation depth controls the hydrochemical compositions of hot springs 4 2 2 faults depths effects the tectonics are mainly nw trending and ne trending faults which are at an angle less than 90 to the maximum regional stress direction approximately nw direction fig 1b these faults are more likely to open up and form high permeability zones wan 2012 causing most hot springs located along the nw trending faults the faults provide pathways for groundwater circulation and connect the deep geothermal reservoirs faults can connect thermal reservoirs at different depths allowing for multiple sources of geothermal water li and cl are conservative elements whose relationships indicate common reservoir sources since their concentrations in geothermal waters of different origins often vary widely arnórsson and andrésdóttir 1995 yi et al 2021 as shown in fig 12c and 12d li is strongly positively correlated with cl in group d 2 na ca hco3 and hef waters r2 values close to 1 and weakly positively correlated with cl in wqf and rrf waters r2 values of 0 55 and 0 67 which suggests that springs controlled by the same faults originate from the similar reservoirs li cl ratios of the geothermal waters associated with faults have three trends fig 12d indicating that at least three reservoir sources hot springs from shallow reservoirs are mostly of ca so4 or ca hco3 type and those from deep reservoirs are na hco3 type waters 4 2 3 evolution of geothermal waters through different reservoirs mixing with shallow groundwater is one of the main processes affecting the hydrochemical characteristics of geothermal waters a silica enthalpy mixing model is an effective tool to evaluate the geothermal water component in mixed waters and to estimate the temperature of the geothermal reservoir based on the measured temperature and steam table data truesdell and fournier 1977 wolfgang and hans joachim 1999 belhai 2013 yi et al 2021 fig 13 the lines intersect the solubility curve of quartz and the intersection point gives provides the values of enthalpy which can be converted into reservoir temperature three lines between the geothermal waters and cold water indicate that they come from at least three geothermal reservoirs of different temperatures fig 14 for the springs geothermal waters in wqf the reservoir temperature is about 175 200 the reservoir temperatures of hef waters and some waters in rrf ye3 ye4 ye6 and ye7 are between 225 and 250 meanwhile the reservoir temperatures of the other waters in rrf are about 125 150 the reservoir temperatures vary widely along the same fault which may be attributed to the heterogeneity of faults tian et al 2021 compared with the reservoir temperatures calculated by the quartz geothermometer fig 7c the results herein are higher which means that geothermal water would be mixed with shallow cold water fig 14 from fig 13 the mixing of cold water in these waters is about 60 90 one of the possible explanations for the high mixing ratios is that the geothermal water is continuously mixing cold water from various pathways during its rising processes which is closely related to the permeability of the geothermal system controlled by the local scale fault networks fig 1b the control effects of faults on the hydrochemistry of hot springs have potential implications for the geothermal water evolution in other similar fault zones the development of fissures in the fault zone leads to more and longer groundwater flow paths the meteoric water in the recharge area infiltrates quickly along the fissures and is less affected by evaporation the hot springs with a deeper circulation depth have experienced a long time water rock interaction and thus have higher tds while li cl ratios are useful to study the source of hot springs it is necessary to combine the lithology of geothermal reservoirs and geothermal settings to understand the geothermal waters evolution from different reservoirs the conceptual model of the mixing process fig 14 can better explain the high proportions of cold water mixing in the hot springs this is of great significance to the simulation of geothermal systems and the exploration of geothermal resources of high temperatures in the fault zone and similar regions 5 conclusions the various hydrochemical types of hot springs are associated with the regional distribution of fault networks in the northern red river zone according to the hydrochemical compositions all the water samples are classified into four hydrochemical groups i group a ca so4 type waters ii group b na so4 type waters iii group c ca hco3 type waters iv group d na hco3 type waters ca and mg mainly come from the carbonate evaporite and silicate minerals weathering or dissolution k and na from the evaporate and silicate minerals dissolution and cation exchange hco3 from the carbonate and silicate minerals dissolution so4 and cl from the evaporite minerals dissolution anhydrite gypsum and halite the oversaturation of calcite is attributed to degassing of co2 high contents of f and si in the hot springs with increasing temperature enhance water rock interactions hydrochemical compositions of the hot springs are controlled by faults in terms of circulation depth and geothermal reservoirs for hot springs along faults there is a positive correlation between tds and circulation depth li cl ratios show that geothermal waters have three reservoir sources of different depths hot springs from shallow reservoirs are mostly of ca so4 or ca hco3 type and those from deep reservoirs are na hco3 type waters the hot spring waters are mixed with the proportions of cold water ranging from 60 to 90 the hot springs with varying mixing ratios may indicate the addition of cold water from different pathways which is related to the heterogeneity of faults in the northern red river fault zone the control effect of faults on the hydrochemistry of hot springs is of potential significance to the evolution of geothermal water which is helpful to geothermal system model construction and the exploitation and utilization of hot springs in fault zones credit authorship contribution statement yanqiu wu conceptualization methodology writing original draft xun zhou supervision writing review
