8585,soil moisture content smc retrievals from synthetic aperture radar sar observations do not exactly match with in situ references due to imperfect retrieval algorithms and uncertainties in the model parameters sar observations and in situ references information on the uncertainty of smc retrievals would contribute to their applicability this paper presents a methodology for deriving the smc retrieval uncertainty and decomposing this in its constituents a bayesian calibration framework was used for deriving the total uncertainty and the model parameter uncertainty the methodology was demonstrated with the integral equation method iem surface scattering model which was employed for reproducing sentinel 1 backscatter σ 0 observations and the retrieval of smc over four sparsely vegetated fields in the netherlands for two meadows the calibrated surface roughness parameter distributions are remarkably similar between the ascending and the descending sentinel 1 orbits as well as between the two meadows and yield consistent smc retrievals for the calibration and validation periods rmsds of 0 076 m3 m 3 to 0 11 m3 m 3 these results are promising for operational retrieval of smc over meadows in contrast the surface roughness parameter distributions of two fallow maize fields differ significantly and the surface roughness conditions changing over time result in less consistent smc retrievals calibration rmsds of 0 096 m3 m 3 and 0 13 m3 m 3 versus validation rmsds of 0 26 m3 m 3 the smc retrieval uncertainty derived with the bayesian calibration successfully reproduces the uncertainty estimated empirically using in situ references the main uncertainty originates from the in situ references and the sentinel 1 observations whereas the contribution from the surface roughness parameters is relatively small the presented research yields further insights into the surface roughness of agricultural fields and smc retrieval uncertainties and these insights can be used to guide sar based smc product developments keywords soil moisture content remote sensing sentinel 1 satellites retrieval uncertainty uncertainty sources soil surface roughness 1 introduction the soil moisture content smc is a key state variable in climatological meteorological hydrological and ecological processes its control on the exchanges of water and energy at the land surface plays an important role in the development of climate and weather systems global climate observing system 2016 massari et al 2014 seneviratne et al 2010 in addition it is important for the partitioning of rainfall in infiltration and runoff beck et al 2009 massari et al 2014 wanders et al 2014 regarded as an indicator for the onset of droughts miralles et al 2016 seneviratne et al 2010 vautard et al 2007 and essential for vegetation growth feddes et al 1976 ines et al 2013 hence information about the smc would benefit a number of applications microwave remote sensing observations from satellites can be used to monitor smc over large spatial domains examples of satellite based smc products are ascat at 25km and 50km wagner et al 2013 amsr 2 at 0 1 and 0 25 zhang et al 2017 kim et al 2015 smos at on average 43km kerr et al 2010 kerr et al 2016 and smap at 3km 9km and 36km resolution chan et al 2016 chan et al 2018 das et al 2019 however these products have a too coarse spatial resolution for many hydrological and agricultural applications de lange et al 2014 carranza et al 2019 pierdicca et al 2014 backscatter σ 0 observations by synthetic aperture radar sar instruments can be used to estimate the smc at much finer scale even up to agricultural field scale e g amazirh et al 2018 el hajj et al 2017 lievens and verhoest 2012 su et al 1997 bauer marschallinger et al 2019 developed an operational 1km resolution smc product from sentinel 1 sar σ 0 observations based on a change detection algorithm that assumes static surface roughness and vegetation conditions however at the field scale this assumption is unlikely to hold because spatial surface roughness and vegetation effects on the σ 0 are not averaged out over a large area bauer marschallinger et al 2019 in those situations the relation between the σ 0 signal and smc must be separated from the effects of surface roughness and vegetation before the smc can be estimated reliably kornelsen and coulibaly 2013 paloscia et al 2013 verhoest et al 2008 physically based scattering models such as the integral equation method iem for surfaces fung et al 1992 and the tor vergata model for vegetation bracaglia et al 1995 simulate the scattering contributions from soil vegetation systems based on prescribed electromagnetic characteristics this supports the application of these models to various site conditions and sensor configurations paloscia et al 2013 petropoulos et al 2015 the understanding of backscattering processes baghdadi et al 2002 balenzano et al 2012 wang et al 2018 and the propagation of uncertainty sources satalino et al 2002 van der velde et al 2012a surface scattering models including the frequently used iem model simulate the scattering of electromagnetic waves from a surface and are used to estimate the σ 0 from soils ulaby and long 2014 the surface roughness essentially governs the σ 0 response and thus the sensitivity to smc the parameterisation of the surface roughness is therefore an important input measuring the surface roughness was part of many field campaigns such as emac 94 su et al 1997 floodgen in 1994 1998 and 1999 baghdadi et al 2004 orgeval 94 zribi et al 1997 ope3 in 2002 joseph et al 2010 smapvex12 mcnairn et al 2015 smapvex16 ia hornbuckle et al 2017 and smapvex16 mb mcnairn et al 2016 however baghdadi et al 2002 baghdadi et al 2004 and su et al 1997 have shown that the iem model does not accurately reproduce σ 0 observations using measured surface roughness parameters lievens et al 2011 and verhoest et al 2008 attributed this to both uncertainties in the surface roughness measurements and simplifications in the representation of surfaces a pragmatic approach for applying surface scattering models to land surfaces is considering the surface roughness parameters as effective parameters obtained by model calibration instead of field measurements baghdadi et al 2002 lievens et al 2011 lievens and verhoest 2012 rahman et al 2008 su et al 1997 verhoest et al 2008 verhoest et al 2007 the calibration of the surface roughness parameters is accomplished by searching for a parameter set that results in a match between σ 0 observations and model simulations subsequently the calibrated surface roughness parameters can be used to retrieve smc from other σ 0 observations and or on other fields su et al 1997 in addition to the surface roughness parameterisation the smc estimates from σ 0 observations will contain uncertainties specific for the selected retrieval algorithm de lannoy et al 2014 pathe et al 2009 and due to uncertainty in the σ 0 observations benninga et al 2019 pathe et al 2009 the σ 0 observations contain uncertainty from calibration uncertainties sensor instabilities and speckle effects which are together referred to as radiometric uncertainty benninga et al 2019 furthermore smc references are required for the calibration of scattering models and the validation of the smc retrievals the smc references are typically obtained from in situ measurements this introduces uncertainties due to a smc probe s measurement uncertainty cosh et al 2005 and spatial scale mismatches with satellite observed smc western and blöschl 1999 cosh et al 2006 a horizontal spatial scale mismatch between the smc at an in situ monitoring station and field averaged smc originates from differences in land cover soil texture and structure and local features such as nearby ditches and subsurface drainage pipes a vertical spatial scale mismatch originates from the sentinel 1 c band σ 0 observations having a sampling depth that varies from the surface to a depth of1cm to 10cm nolan and fatland 2003 ulaby et al 1996 whereas in practice smc measurements at 5cm or 10cm depth with an influence zone of e g 4cm above and below the probe benninga et al 2018 often have to be adopted for calibration and validation purposes e g bauer marschallinger et al 2019 chan et al 2018 kornelsen and coulibaly 2013 pathe et al 2009 van der velde et al 2015 information on the uncertainty of smc retrievals is essential to assess their reliability and for their applicability for example for the assimilation of smc retrievals into land surface models and for combining smc products pierdicca et al 2014 verhoest et al 2007 de lannoy et al 2014 verhoest et al 2007 estimated the uncertainty of smc retrievals with the iem model by defining uncertainty distributions for the surface roughness parameters as a result of assumed surface roughness parameter uncertainties of 7 5 15 and 25 verhoest et al 2007 reported smc retrieval uncertainties standard deviations of 0 023 m3 m 3 0 041 m3 m 3 and 0 060 m3 m 3 respectively vernieuwe et al 2011 continued on the study by verhoest et al 2007 by considering the correlation between the parameters based on a synthetically generated surface roughness data set doubková et al 2012 and pathe et al 2009 estimated the uncertainty of smc retrievals from parameter uncertainty assumptions and the radiometric uncertainty pulvirenti et al 2018 defined fuzzy logic rules in order to assign a degree of uncertainty low medium high to each smc retrieval these previous studies however relied on assumptions regarding the uncertainty of model parameters for the estimation of the smc retrieval uncertainty this is reflected in the applied calibration methods in general which ignore uncertainties and aim for one optimal parameter set that results in a match between observations and simulations e g joseph et al 2008 lievens et al 2011 verhoest et al 2007 bayesian calibration approaches allow for the derivation of parameter distributions and the separation of parameter uncertainty from the total simulation uncertainty based on statistical assumptions of which the validity can be verified barber et al 2012 de lannoy et al 2014 haddad et al 1996 notarnicola et al 2006 notarnicola and posa 2004 pierdicca et al 2014 for example using semi empirical oh surface scattering models oh et al 1992 oh et al 2002 haddad et al 1996 pierdicca et al 2014 and pierdicca et al 2010 formulated bayesian frameworks for the retrieval of surface roughness parameters and smc along with estimates of their retrieval uncertainty bayesian frameworks cannot be solved analytically for highly nonlinear models vrugt 2016 such as physically based scattering models to provide an efficient solution for such models the differential evolution adaptive metropolis package dream vrugt 2016 implements a multi chain markov chain monte carlo simulation algorithm for generating samples from the posterior distributions that describe the parameter uncertainty and the total simulation uncertainty de lannoy et al 2014 used dream to calibrate a radiative transfer model for simulating smos l band brightness temperatures and to estimate the uncertainty of the parameters and the total simulation uncertainty in this study the uncertainties involved in surface scattering model simulations and smc retrievals were investigated we focused on the calibration of the iem surface roughness parameters and therefore used sentinel 1 σ 0 observations and smc measurements from sparsely vegetated fields namely two meadows and two fallow cultivated parcels the bayesian calibration was performed with dream the paper extends on previous research on smc retrieval from sar σ 0 observations by 1 adopting a bayesian calibration framework for deriving the uncertainty of the iem surface roughness parameters and the total uncertainty 2 assessing the derived smc retrieval uncertainty against the uncertainty estimated empirically using in situ references and 3 decomposing the total uncertainty in its four constituents 2 definitions of uncertainties the standard deviation is selected as uncertainty measure the standard deviation of the differences between two data sets such as smc retrievals and references is often referred to as the unbiased root mean square deviation urmsd kerr et al 2016 1 urmsd t 1 n y e t y r y e y r t 2 n where n stands for the number of match ups between estimates y e and references y r t stands for the observation number and the bars denote the means of y e and y r a smc retrieval its total uncertainty and constituents are illustrated in fig 1 the surface roughness parameters for retrieving the smc as well as the parameter uncertainty u p and total uncertainty were derived with bayesian calibrations using dream as described in section 4 we refer to the total uncertainty that is derived with the bayesian calibration as u total b the surface roughness parameter set with the highest posterior probability also referred to as the maximum a posteriori map vrugt 2016 de lannoy et al 2014 lu et al 2017 was used for the optimal smc retrieval u total b should be of similar magnitude as the empirical uncertainty of smc retrievals for cases that the bayesian calibration was statistically valid de lannoy et al 2014 the empirical smc retrieval uncertainty can be calculated with eq 1 using in situ references the u total b and u p are visualized by two histograms in fig 1 which partly overlap and show that the distribution of the u total b is wider than the distribution of the u p this is expected as u p is one of the constituents of the total uncertainty the other constituents are inherent to the in situ references and the satellite observations namely the measurement uncertainty of the station probes providing the in situ references u sp the in situ references uncertainty attributable to a spatial scale mismatch with sentinel 1 observed smc u s s 1 and sentinel 1 s radiometric uncertainty u s 1 fig 1 illustrates that u sp and u s s 1 apply to the in situ references and u s 1 applies to the smc retrievals in section 3 the u sp u s s 1 and u s 1 are quantified next to its estimation with the bayesian calibration the total uncertainty can be found by combining its constituents this is referred to as u total c and can be calculated by following the addition rule for variances moore et al 2017 2 u total c u sp 2 u s s 1 2 u s 1 2 u p 2 cov where cov stands for the covariance terms between the uncertainty constituents the constituents are assumed to be uncorrelated whereby cov reduces to 0 the relative contributions of u sp u s s 1 u s 1 and u p can then be calculated in a similar fashion as was done in van der velde et al 2012b 3 rc sp u sp 2 u total c 2 4 rc s s 1 u s s 1 2 u total c 2 5 rc s 1 u s 1 2 u total c 2 and 6 rc p u p 2 u total c 2 with eq 2 we can evaluate to what extent u total c explains u total b and with eqs 3 6 we can assess their individual relative contributions 3 data 3 1 study region fields and periods the smc measurements used as references were collected by monitoring stations in the twente region located in the eastern part of the netherlands fig 2 the twente region is flat with some elevated glacial ridges and it has a temperate oceanic climate with a cfb köppen geiger climate classification beck et al 2018 the smc monitoring stations in this region are collectively known as the twente network dente et al 2011 2012 van der velde et al in review 2019 stations are installed at the border of fields for safety and continuity reasons adjacent to monitoring stations we selected two meadows hereafter field i and ii and two fallow cultivated fields field iii and iv as study fields for which we collected additional field measurements in total on 87 occasions the study fields and the locations of the field measurements are shown in fig 3 field i and iii are adjacent to the same monitoring station the study fields have loamy sandy surface layers supplement 1 details the study fields surface layer soil textures and bulk densities from the soil physical map of the netherlands bofek2012 wösten et al 2013 table 1 lists the study periods we used the winter season of october 2016 march 2017 for the calibration of the surface roughness parameters and the winter season of october 2017 march 2018 for the validation of σ 0 simulations and smc retrievals the study periods are taken outside the growing season from october after harvesting and other agricultural practices to march before ploughing and sowing so that the fields were fallow or covered with non growing sparse vegetation and no agricultural practices were applied during the study periods in between the winter seasons several agricultural practices are applied on cultivated fields field iii and iv such as sowing harvesting manuring and ploughing on meadows field i and ii typically no ploughing is applied and the surface roughness is expected to change little table 2 lists the land covers at the locations of the smc monitoring stations and on the study fields during the calibration and validation period field i and ii are covered with grass which is virtually static and sparse during winters field measurements with the li cor lai 2000 li cor 1992 indicated leaf area indices lai of 1 1m2 m 2 and 1 3m2 m 2 outside the growing season versus maximums of 8 0m2 m 2 and 7 7m2 m 2 in the growing season for field i and ii respectively benninga et al 2020a field iii and iv were fallow with remaining maize stubble in the winter of 2016 2017 in the winter of 2017 2018 field iii was again fallow with maize stubble whereas field iv was used to grow winter wheat table 2 indicates that also the land cover at station iv changed between the calibration and the validation period this station was installed on 20 may 2016 in the first period after installation the land cover at the station s location was similar to the study field the second year it was covered with grassy vegetation because the area with the station probes was no longer directly subjected to agricultural practices 3 2 soil moisture content references the smc monitoring stations are equipped with 5tm probes meter group 2019 installed at nominal depths of 5cm 10cm 20cm 40cm and 80cm of which the readings are stored every 15 min we used the 5cm smc measurements collected at sentinel 1 overpass times as the in situ references the probes at 5cm depth provide an integrated measurement over a soil depth of 1cm to 9cm benninga et al 2018 the smc measurements inside the study fields revealed an inconsistency in the station measurements of field iv during the period may 2016 november 2016 the station measurements had a bias of 0 024m3 m 3 with respect to the field measurements whereas for the period april 2017 september 2017 the bias increased to 0 12m3 m 3 see table s3 this likely is a consequence of the change in the land cover at the station s location from fallow with maize stubble to grassy vegetation see table 2 and section 3 1 3 2 1 measurement uncertainty a soil specific calibration function was developed for the station probes of the twente network van der velde et al in review 2019 the calibration accuracy quantified by eq 1 between the calibrated probe measurements and gravimetrically determined volumetric smc gvsmc references is 0 027 m3 m 3 we adopted this value as general measure for the u sp 3 2 2 spatial scale mismatch uncertainty the horizontal and vertical spatial scale mismatches have a systematic and a variable impact on differences between the smc references and sentinel 1 observed smc the systematic component is a bias which will implicitly be accounted for via the calibration of the surface roughness parameters the variable component is u s s 1 which contributes to the uncertainty of sentinel 1 smc retrievals the u s s 1 was quantified by eq 1 between the station measurements and the spatial mean of the 0cm 5cm layer smc measurements inside field i iv supplement 2 provides further information on the estimation of u s s 1 the values for u s s 1 in table s3 demonstrate that adopting the station measurements as reference for the sentinel 1 smc retrievals introduces a significant amount of uncertainty varying from 0 036 m3 m 3 to 0 068 m3 m 3 we adopted the mean of 0 051 m3 m 3 over field i iv as the common measure for u s s 1 3 3 sentinel 1 imagery 3 3 1 data processing the sentinel 1 constellation provides images in c band 5 405ghz over land in interferometric wide swath iw mode at vv and vh polarization we only used the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations in vv polarization because of the higher expected sensitivity to smc than the vh polarization e g amazirh et al 2018 el hajj et al 2017 and because the definitions of the surface roughness parameters in the iem model are different for vv and vh due to underlying assumptions the radiometric accuracy is specified at 1db three standard deviations after multi looking the ground range detected grd high resolution hr product has a resolution of 20 m 22 m 4 4 equivalent number of looks torres et al 2012 bourbigot et al 2016 to obtain sentinel 1 backscatter σ 0 we downloaded level 1 grd hr iw sentinel 1 images from the copernicus open access hub copernicus 2019 and processed them using the following operations in esa s sentinel application platform snap v6 0 european space agency 2019 1 apply orbit file 2 thermal noise removal and 3 range doppler terrain correction including radiometric normalization to σ 0 in m2 m 2 with projected local incidence angles on a geographic grid wgs84 with a pixel spacing of 9 0e 5 equivalent to 10m 6 1m at the study region s latitude subsequently the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations were averaged over the study fields excluding a 20 m distance from the borders of the fields and 40 m from trees and buildings to avoid possible influences of features outside the fields see the net area in table 2 the last step was to convert the σ 0 values to decibel db table 3 specifies the orbits that cover the study region sentinel 1a provides images since 3 october 2014 and sentinel 1b since 28 september 2016 the combination of sentinel 1a and sentinel 1b gives a temporal resolution of 1 5 days over the study region however frozen conditions wet snow and intercepted rain can disturb σ 0 observations and we masked the sentinel 1 observations for these weather related surface conditions with the masking rules presented in benninga et al 2019 which are summarized in supplement 3 furthermore in situ references that decreased during frozen soil periods van der velde et al in review 2019 were removed and from 18 january 2018 to 16 march 2018 the smc monitoring station adjacent to field ii was malfunctioning and no references are available for this period table 4 lists the number of sentinel 1 observations with a matching in situ reference before and after masking for the above mentioned weather related surface conditions 3 3 2 radiometric uncertainty sentinel 1 s radiometric uncertainty s s 1 indb was estimated by the standard deviation of sentinel 1 σ 0 observations from a target which is assumed time invariant benninga et al 2019 this resulted in a second order power function between s s 1 and the surface area over which the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations are averaged the smc retrieval uncertainty due to the s s 1 being u s 1 is then derived through combination with the σ 0 to smc sensitivity which follows from simulations with the iem model 4 methods 4 1 surface scattering model application iem is a physically based surface scattering model fung et al 1992 that has widely been used to simulate the σ 0 from bare and sparsely vegetated land surfaces readers are referred to ulaby and long 2014 for more background on the iem model and to kornelsen and coulibaly 2013 for a discussion of previous studies in which iem was used vegetation effects are not accounted for by the iem model and accordingly we limited the calibration and validation periods to the fallow or non growing sparse vegetation conditions outside the growing season see section 3 1 the applicability of the iem model to sparse grass covers is justified by the results of van der velde and su 2009 and van der velde et al 2012a van der velde and su 2009 found that for c band σ 0 observations the effects of grass with a normalized difference vegetation index ndvi varying from 0 15 in winters to 0 55 in summers are small throughout the entire year these ndvi values correspond to lai values of approximately 0 38 m2 m 2 to 1 63 m2 m 2 knyazikhin et al 1999 tesemma et al 2014 which is comparable to our lai measurements outside the growing season moreover the smc retrieval uncertainties attributable to vegetation effects were found to be fairly small compared to uncertainties caused by the surface roughness parameterisation van der velde et al 2012a the iem model requires parameterisations on the dielectric and geometric properties of the land surface the dielectric properties were estimated with the mironov soil dielectric mixing model mironov et al 2009 smc and the soil textures from supplement 1 served as input to the mironov model the geometry of the land also known as the surface roughness is parameterised by the root mean square surface height s the autocorrelation length c l and an autocorrelation function the exponential autocorrelation function was selected because it is viewed as most appropriate for agricultural fields ulaby and long 2014 verhoest et al 2008 callens et al 2006 have shown that changes in surface roughness due to heavy rainfall are limited when no agricultural practices were applied recently the study periods were taken such that no agricultural practices were applied within them see section 3 1 and therefore surface roughness can be assumed time invariant this assumption is discussed in section 5 3 agricultural surfaces are generally anisotropic verhoest et al 2008 and the fields are viewed from a different direction in sentinel 1 s ascending and descending orbits causing that the surface roughness would be different for these orbits this is especially expected for the fallow maize fields which have tillage rows see fig 3 the meadows do not have a clear row structure the anisotropy of the study fields was considered by separating the calibration of s and c l for the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations made in the ascending and in the descending orbits by combining the two ascending orbits 15 and 88 and the two descending orbits 37 and 139 respectively the surface roughness parameters were calibrated on two incidence angles see table 3 and the varying smc conditions encountered during the calibration period 4 2 bayesian model calibration bayesian model calibration derives posterior parameter distributions conditioned on prior parameter distributions prior and the match between model simulations and reference data likelihood by solving bayes rule vrugt 2016 7 p θ z likelihood prior where p θ z is the resulting posterior probability density function pdf of the parameters θ given the reference data z the likelihood function evaluates how well the model reproduces z given θ by describing the pdf of the residuals between simulations and references the generalized likelihood function derived by schoups and vrugt 2010 offers a wide flexibility in heteroscedasticity distribution and autocorrelation of the residuals the likelihood model parameters have to be inferred jointly with the model parameters or must be given a fixed value the validity of the residual model can be verified with a residual analysis for more background on residual analysis readers are referred to lu et al 2017 scharnagl et al 2011 schoups and vrugt 2010 and thyer et al 2009 4 3 application of dream we adopted a simple implementation of the generalized likelihood function and assumed homoscedastic gaussian and uncorrelated residuals these assumptions are often made and convenient to use e g lu et al 2017 raj et al 2018 scharnagl et al 2011 and lead to the common standard least squares approach schoups and vrugt 2010 in section 5 1 the validity of the residual model is verified with a residual analysis the standard deviation of the residuals σ 0 has to be inferred with the calibration the two surface roughness parameters in combination with σ 0 bring the dimensionality number of unknowns at three the validity of the iem model is limited to medium surface roughness conditions with ks 3 where k is the free space wavenumber baghdadi et al 2004 su et al 1997 for the wavelength of sentinel 1 this corresponds to a maximum s of 2 68cm for c l no iem validity domain has been formulated calibration ranges of 0 2cm to 400cm have been used and the resulting calibrated c l values ranged from 1 4cm to 13cm for maize and bare agricultural fields joseph et al 2010 joseph et al 2008 lievens et al 2011 satalino et al 2002 verhoest et al 2007 and from 0 2cm to 7cm for a mosaic of grasslands and wetlands van der velde et al 2012a non informative uniform priors are preferred for scientific objectivity lunn et al 2013 notarnicola and posa 2004 notarnicola et al 2006 we defined the prior distributions as uniform distributions with the ranges 0 1cm 2 68cm for s and 0 1cm 100cm for c l the prior distribution of σ 0 is defined as a uniform distribution with ranges 0db 2db we used the standard dream settings vrugt 2016 with ten markov chains a burn in of 50 of the realizations is recommended to allow initialization to the posterior parameter distributions vrugt 2016 convergence of the chains was assessed by the multivariate gelman rubin convergence diagnostic r d where r d below 1 2 indicates convergence brooks and gelman 1998 vrugt 2016 and by visual inspection of the mixing of the markov chains raj et al 2018 vrugt 2016 7000 realizations per chain appeared sufficient to reach convergence after 50 of the realizations which results in 35000 samples describing the posterior parameter distributions 4 4 soil moisture content retrieval the map surface roughness parameter set was used for the optimal σ 0 simulations and smc retrievals these were evaluated against the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations and in situ smc references respectively with the root mean square deviation rmsd the unbiased rmsd urmsd and the pearson correlation coefficient r p defined in supplement 4 for the retrieval of smc from the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations we generated look up tables of σ 0 simulations for smc values ranging from 0 01 m3 m 3 to 0 75 m3 m 3 with an increment of 0 001 m3 m 3 and combinations of soil textures incidence angles and surface roughness parameter sets a smc retrieval is then taken equal to the smc value for which the minimum difference between σ 0 simulations and a sentinel 1 σ 0 observation is found for deriving u total b we generated 1000 σ 0 residual samples from the skew exponential power distribution that underlies the likelihood function schoups and vrugt 2010 using the σ 0 that was found for the map surface roughness parameter set the resulting 1000 smc retrievals with the map surface roughness parameters after superimposing the σ 0 residual samples on a sentinel 1 σ 0 observation describe u total b for the computation of u p we randomly sampled 1000 surface roughness parameter sets from their posterior distributions and derived 1000 smc retrievals 5 results and discussion 5 1 residual analysis the residual analysis plots for the bayesian calibrations are included in supplement 5 1 the figures a in figs s1 s4 show for fields i to iv that the residual variances are generally independent of the simulated σ 0 which justifies the use of a homoscedastic residual model the figures b show that the deviations from the theoretical quantiles for a gaussian distribution are only substantial for a few σ 0 simulations at the tails and not systematic among the calibration cases so we accepted the validity of the gaussian residual distribution only for field iv a number of outliers can be observed which is further discussed with regard to the σ 0 simulations in section 5 3 the calibration cases show some autocorrelation with mean values of 0 40 at a lag of one time step and 0 28 at a lag of two time steps figures c in figs s1 s4 in the bayesian calibration of process models such as rainfall runoff models schoups and vrugt 2010 and terrestrial ecosystem models lu et al 2017 autocorrelation in the residuals can be accounted for with autoregressive residual models however the iem model does not contain state variables using autoregressive residual models therefore does not change the posterior parameter distributions nor the residual analysis plots of our calibration results in supplement 6 this is demonstrated by showing for field i the calibration results obtained with a first order and a second order autoregressive residual model supplement 5 2 contains the residual analysis plots for the validation period figs s5 s8 show that the homoscedastic gaussian residual model is generally also valid for the validation period the quantile quantile plots already give an outlook on the performances of the σ 0 simulations and smc retrievals in the validation period regarding field i the quantile quantile plot fig s5b is steeper larger dispersion than the quantile quantile plot for the calibration period and it reveals a bias compare to the plot s origin 0 0 hence a slightly degraded performance and a bias are expected for the validation period for field ii the quantile quantile plots for the calibration and the validation period figs s2b and s6b are comparable so we expect similar performances for field iii fig s7b and field iv fig s8b steep lines and high biases are observed suggesting worse performances for the validation period 5 2 posterior parameter distributions figs 4 7 show the posterior parameter sets and the map s and c l for fields i to iv joseph et al 2008 lievens et al 2011 rahman et al 2008 and verhoest et al 2007 already reported that multiple optimal combinations of s and c l are possible the scatter plots in figs 4 7 illustrate that the posterior distributions of the surface roughness parameters actually cover a large part of the solution space and that the s and c l are highly correlated spearman s rank correlation coefficient r s is 0 97 to 1 0 individual values of s or c l therefore do not contain much information about the surface roughness for example s values of 0 5cm to 1 5cm are found in the posterior parameter distributions of all the fields hence both s and c l or a ratio between them should be used to characterize the roughness of a surface from figs 4 7 it is clear that the relation between s and c l is non linear and that the simple s c l ratio will not suffice instead it is approximately a square root relation and the parameter z s s 2 c l zribi and dechambre 2002 is suitable for characterizing the roughness of the surfaces for the meadows figs 4 and 5 the ascending and the descending orbits posterior distributions coincide in other words the surface roughness is similar for the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations made in the ascending and in the descending orbits this is an indication that the meadows have an isotropic surface roughness at least in sentinel 1 s ascending and descending orbit viewing directions therefore we also calibrated the surface roughness parameters with the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations from both passes combined of which the results are also shown in figs 4 and 5 the parameter sets obtained from the combined calibration were used in the remainder of this paper furthermore the posterior parameter distributions of the two meadows are quite similar the map s values are 0 16cm and 0 18cm and the c l values are 1 31cm and 1 49cm for field i and field ii respectively in section 5 3 we discuss the cross validation results of the map surface roughness parameters of field i applied to retrieve the smc for field ii and vice versa for the fallow maize fields figs 6 and 7 the ascending and the descending orbits posterior distributions are different this was expected as these fields do have an anisotropic surface due to tillage rows and these are viewed from different angles in the ascending and descending orbits 5 3 retrievals the map smc retrievals u p and u total b are plotted as time series in fig 8 and table 5 lists the performance metrics of the map smc retrievals for the calibration and the validation period time series and performance metrics of the forward σ 0 simulations using the smc references and calibrated surface roughness parameters as input to the iem model are shown in fig 9 and table 6 respectively 5 3 1 meadows the performance of the meadows map σ 0 simulations is comparable for the calibration and the validation period this indicates that the surface roughness remained similar which can be explained by the fact that no ploughing was applied on the meadows the increase in the empirical uncertainty urmsd eq 1 of the smc retrievals can be explained by the wetter conditions during the validation period iem model simulations show that the σ 0 to smc sensitivity diminishes with increasing smc see for example fig 3 in altese et al 1996 and the results in benninga et al 2019 which results in larger smc deviations for equal σ 0 deviations under wetter conditions because of this the smc retrieval uncertainty distributions in fig 8 are also wider at higher smc and they are skewed towards the higher smc levels the posterior surface roughness parameter distributions and the map values are quite similar for the two meadows to further verify this we performed a cross validation by retrieving the smc for field ii using the map surface roughness parameters of field i and vice versa table 5 lists the smc retrieval performances and supplement 7 includes the smc and σ 0 time series figures the calibration has aimed to optimize the rmsd of the σ 0 simulations so it could be expected that the rmsd for the calibration period is higher using the map parameter set of the other meadow in general the smc retrieval performances are comparable using the map surface roughness parameter sets obtained for the other meadow 5 3 2 fallow fields the validation performances for the fallow fields are considerably worse than the calibration performances field iii was fallow with maize stubble during both the calibration and the validation period but the surface roughness is likely to be different due to agricultural practices in between furthermore figs 8c and 9c show in the validation period three distinctive periods from 14 october 2017 to 10 november 2017 with low smc retrievals high σ 0 simulations from 15 november 2017 to 14 january 2018 with high smc retrievals low σ 0 simulations and from 15 january 2018 to 21 march 2018 with low smc retrievals high σ 0 simulations however the field was harvested in september october 2017 and not ploughed after may 2017 so changes in surface roughness due to agricultural practices and heavy rainfall were not expected this result demonstrates that even under these circumstances the fallow field cannot be simulated with a single set of surface roughness parameters besides sentinel 1 σ 0 observations of up to 3db in the calibration period and 2db in the validation period were acquired for field iii with a maximum of 1 62db these sentinel 1 observations all originate from relative orbit number 15 the iem model with an exponential autocorrelation function for the surface roughness cannot reproduce such high σ 0 observations with any set of surface roughness parameters therefore we omitted the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations of field iii acquired in relative orbit 15 for further analysis in this study an additional calibration was performed exclusively on the sentinel 1 observations acquired in relative orbit 88 of which the results are presented in supplement 8 the posterior parameter distributions fig s14 and the σ 0 simulation performances fig s17 for this calibration are however similar to the calibration on both ascending orbits using the original surface roughness parameter sets and omitting the orbit 15 sentinel 1 σ 0 observations does improve the σ 0 simulation and smc retrieval performances tables 5 and 6 for field iv the validation performances are more degraded than for field iii this can be explained by the different land covers in the calibration and the validation period table 2 and by the bias in the in situ references during the validation period section 3 2 fig 10 a shows the residuals of the map smc retrievals with the original references and with the references corrected for the bias of 0 12 m3 m 3 part of the residuals can indeed be explained by this bias however still three periods can be distinguished in the residuals between 17 october 2017 and the sowing of the winter wheat on 10 november 2017 the rmsd against the bias corrected references is 0 10 m3 m 3 13 observations between 13 november 2017 and 6 december 2017 the rmsd is smallest with a value of 0 050 m3 m 3 10 observations and after 15 december 2017 the rmsd is 0 19 m3 m 3 32 observations the development of the winter wheat vegetation on this field during the validation period does not have a large effect as this should otherwise be visible as a gradual trend in the residuals extending to april 2018 moreover at the end of the validation period the wheat cover is still sparse as is shown in fig 10b a number of heavy rainfall events occurred between 6 december 2017 and 15 december 2017 in total 64 mm callens et al 2006 demonstrated that rainfall smoothens the surface and reduces the surface roughness on recently tilled fields indeed the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations being lower after 15 december 2017 is in accordance with a reduced surface roughness a number of outliers were observed in the residual analysis plots of the calibrations on field iv as visualized in fig s4 the σ 0 simulations in the first part of the calibration period between 14 october 2016 and 6 november 2016 hold the largest residuals and all these residuals are on one side of the quantile quantile plots this indicates that the surface roughness conditions has changed within the calibration period as discussed in the previous paragraphs for both fallow fields the same holds between the calibration and the validation period as well as within the validation periods 5 3 3 note on the soil moisture content references it should be noted that the smc references extend to higher levels than saturated smcs generally observed bofek2012 wösten et al 2013 lists saturated smc values of 0 44 m3 m 3 0 45 m3 m 3 for the surface layers 0cm to 23cm depth of field i to iv these values are exceeded by the station smc measurements this can be partly attributed to higher organic matter content and root density near the soil surface organic matter increases smc values especially in sandy and loamy sandy soils minasny and mcbratney 2018 in addition local soil variability is not captured by bofek2012 local soil variability is not considered in the probes calibration function and roots and macropores in the probes influence zone can increase measured smc benninga et al 2018 however even with consideration of these factors the very high smc measurements especially for field ii seem unrealistic in absolute sense nevertheless the correlations between the station and field measurements listed in table s3 are high it can therefore be expected that the station measurements capture the temporal variability of the adjacent field s smc the absolute smc measurement values may still deviate from realistic values this will affect the surface roughness parameters obtained by the calibration and for the smc retrieval over independent periods or fields it may be necessary to apply an unbiasing procedure this is reflected in the meadows cross validation results see tables 5 and 6 the rmsds which include the bias in the mean are generally higher than the original calibration metrics whereas the r p and urmsds which exclude this bias are comparable 5 4 retrieval uncertainty fig 11 shows u total b in comparison to the uncertainty of the map smc retrievals estimated empirically using the smc references and fig 12 shows u total b relative to u total c for bins of smc references the empirical uncertainty is quantified with eq 1 but without removing the bias for each bin separately to preserve the integrity of the time series pdfs for field i and ii both the calibration and the validation period are included figs 11a and b since it was found that the parameters calibrated for the cultivated fields field iii and iv are invalid for the validation period the latter period is not included in figs 11c f as a consequence of that and because the ascending and descending orbits are separated for field iii and iv the total number of pairs is larger for field i and ii and for visualization purposes the number of pairs per bin in figs 11 and 12 is ten for field i and ii and five for field iii and iv the increasing empirical uncertainty and u total b with increasing smc in fig 11 are explained by the diminishing σ 0 to smc sensitivity with increasing smc as was discussed in section 5 3 1 both the increasing trend and the magnitude of the empirical uncertainty are rather closely approximated by u total b in other words the smc retrieval uncertainty derived with the bayesian calibration does successfully reproduce the uncertainty estimated empirically this does however not hold for field iv as explained in section 5 3 2 the iem model does not correctly reproduce the σ 0 of field iv within the calibration period with a single set of surface roughness parameters as a consequence the likelihood function implementation with a homoscedastic residual standard deviation is not valid over the complete calibration period fig 12 shows that the combination of u sp u s s 1 u s 1 and u p i e u total c approximately explains u total b except for field iv again fig 12 also shows the relative squared contributions of u sp u s s 1 u s 1 and u p namely rc sp rc s s 1 rc s 1 and rc p the rc p is relatively small and constant across the investigated smc domain with an average of 13 over the smc domain and fields i to iii this means that the u p increases with smc because the total uncertainty increases with increasing smc from the assumption that u sp and u s s 1 are equal to 0 027 m3 m 3 and 0 051 m3 m 3 across the entire smc domain follows that their relative contributions rc sp and rc s s 1 decrease with increasing smc because the total uncertainty increases with smc the average rc sp and rc s s 1 decrease respectively from 13 and 46 at a smc of 0 26 m3 m 3 to 4 and 15 at a smc of 0 53 m3 m 3 the average rc s 1 increases from 31 at a smc of 0 26 m3 m 3 to 67 at a smc of 0 53 m3 m 3 which is explained by the increasing u s 1 with increasing smc benninga et al 2019 the u s 1 is found to be the dominant driver for the increasing smc retrieval uncertainty with increasing smc for field iii the rc s 1 is even larger than for the other fields at an equal smc level because of field iii s smaller surface area 6 conclusions the total uncertainty and its constituents were investigated for smc retrievals from sentinel 1 σ 0 observations over four sparsely vegetated fields two meadows and two fallow cultivated fields a bayesian framework was used for calibrating the surface roughness parameters that are input to the iem surface scattering model and for deriving the parameter and total uncertainty distributions subsequently these distributions were used to retrieve the smc and its uncertainty and the relative contributions of four uncertainty sources were evaluated this resulted in the following conclusions 1 the simplest implementation of the likelihood function using a homoscedastic gaussian residual model describes the simulation residuals an exception is when the iem model is not capable of reproducing the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations in a calibration or validation period with a single set of surface roughness parameters 2 the surface roughness parameters s and c l are highly correlated with spearman s rank correlation coefficients r s of 0 97 to 1 0 the s and c l have approximately a square root relation and the parameter z s s 2 c l which was already introduced in zribi and dechambre 2002 is shown to be suitable for characterizing the roughness of the surfaces this result also implies that it is valid to fix one of the parameters s or c l for simplifying the calibration while still acquiring the same posterior z s distribution 3 for the two meadows the surface roughness parameter distributions coincide for sentinel 1 s ascending and descending orbits despite the different directions from which sentinel 1 views the fields in these passes furthermore the surface roughness parameter distributions of the two meadows are quite similar in contrast for the two fallow fields the surface roughness parameter distributions depend on the pass direction and the distributions differ between the two fields this is attributed to the anisotropic nature of these surfaces caused by tillage rows 4 the performance of the smc retrievals for the calibration period expressed by the rmsd is between 0 076 m3 m 3 and 0 13 m3 m 3 the validation results for an independent period confirm that for the meadows the surface roughness parameters can be used across years for the fallow fields however the surface roughness conditions change not only between the calibration and the validation period but even within single winter periods 5 the total smc retrieval uncertainty derived with the bayesian calibration successfully reproduces the uncertainty estimated empirically using in situ references including the trend of increasing uncertainty with increasing smc 6 the in situ references measurement uncertainty u sp and spatial scale mismatch uncertainty u s s 1 the smc retrieval uncertainty due to sentinel 1 s radiometric uncertainty u s 1 and the parameter uncertainty u p constitute the total uncertainty the main uncertainty originates from the in situ references and the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations whereas the contribution from the surface roughness parameters is relatively small the two meadows coinciding surface roughness parameter distributions for the ascending and descending orbits their similar surface roughness and consistent smc retrievals for the calibration and validation period are promising results for operational retrieval of smc over meadows the value of such a smc product would be substantial as meadows cover a major portion of the land in use for agriculture e g 71 in the study region twente and 55 in the netherlands in 2017 ministerie van economische zaken 2017 therefore further research to the selection of a common surface roughness parameter set for meadows and the associated retrieval uncertainty would be interesting to improve the performance of the sentinel 1 smc retrievals it will be essential to reduce the in situ references uncertainties and the radiometric uncertainty the references uncertainties can be reduced by averaging multiple spatially distributed measurements reducing the impact of radiometric uncertainty can be achieved by accepting a coarser spatial resolution or a further improvement of the sar image processing by the bayesian calibration of the iem model further insights into the surface roughness of agricultural fields and smc retrieval uncertainties have been derived these insights can be used to guide sar based smc product developments moreover the study shows the utility of bayesian calibration approaches for deriving such new insights and the presented methodology may serve as an example for the bayesian calibration of other scattering model applications 7 data availability the smc measurements that

8585,soil moisture content smc retrievals from synthetic aperture radar sar observations do not exactly match with in situ references due to imperfect retrieval algorithms and uncertainties in the model parameters sar observations and in situ references information on the uncertainty of smc retrievals would contribute to their applicability this paper presents a methodology for deriving the smc retrieval uncertainty and decomposing this in its constituents a bayesian calibration framework was used for deriving the total uncertainty and the model parameter uncertainty the methodology was demonstrated with the integral equation method iem surface scattering model which was employed for reproducing sentinel 1 backscatter σ 0 observations and the retrieval of smc over four sparsely vegetated fields in the netherlands for two meadows the calibrated surface roughness parameter distributions are remarkably similar between the ascending and the descending sentinel 1 orbits as well as between the two meadows and yield consistent smc retrievals for the calibration and validation periods rmsds of 0 076 m3 m 3 to 0 11 m3 m 3 these results are promising for operational retrieval of smc over meadows in contrast the surface roughness parameter distributions of two fallow maize fields differ significantly and the surface roughness conditions changing over time result in less consistent smc retrievals calibration rmsds of 0 096 m3 m 3 and 0 13 m3 m 3 versus validation rmsds of 0 26 m3 m 3 the smc retrieval uncertainty derived with the bayesian calibration successfully reproduces the uncertainty estimated empirically using in situ references the main uncertainty originates from the in situ references and the sentinel 1 observations whereas the contribution from the surface roughness parameters is relatively small the presented research yields further insights into the surface roughness of agricultural fields and smc retrieval uncertainties and these insights can be used to guide sar based smc product developments keywords soil moisture content remote sensing sentinel 1 satellites retrieval uncertainty uncertainty sources soil surface roughness 1 introduction the soil moisture content smc is a key state variable in climatological meteorological hydrological and ecological processes its control on the exchanges of water and energy at the land surface plays an important role in the development of climate and weather systems global climate observing system 2016 massari et al 2014 seneviratne et al 2010 in addition it is important for the partitioning of rainfall in infiltration and runoff beck et al 2009 massari et al 2014 wanders et al 2014 regarded as an indicator for the onset of droughts miralles et al 2016 seneviratne et al 2010 vautard et al 2007 and essential for vegetation growth feddes et al 1976 ines et al 2013 hence information about the smc would benefit a number of applications microwave remote sensing observations from satellites can be used to monitor smc over large spatial domains examples of satellite based smc products are ascat at 25km and 50km wagner et al 2013 amsr 2 at 0 1 and 0 25 zhang et al 2017 kim et al 2015 smos at on average 43km kerr et al 2010 kerr et al 2016 and smap at 3km 9km and 36km resolution chan et al 2016 chan et al 2018 das et al 2019 however these products have a too coarse spatial resolution for many hydrological and agricultural applications de lange et al 2014 carranza et al 2019 pierdicca et al 2014 backscatter σ 0 observations by synthetic aperture radar sar instruments can be used to estimate the smc at much finer scale even up to agricultural field scale e g amazirh et al 2018 el hajj et al 2017 lievens and verhoest 2012 su et al 1997 bauer marschallinger et al 2019 developed an operational 1km resolution smc product from sentinel 1 sar σ 0 observations based on a change detection algorithm that assumes static surface roughness and vegetation conditions however at the field scale this assumption is unlikely to hold because spatial surface roughness and vegetation effects on the σ 0 are not averaged out over a large area bauer marschallinger et al 2019 in those situations the relation between the σ 0 signal and smc must be separated from the effects of surface roughness and vegetation before the smc can be estimated reliably kornelsen and coulibaly 2013 paloscia et al 2013 verhoest et al 2008 physically based scattering models such as the integral equation method iem for surfaces fung et al 1992 and the tor vergata model for vegetation bracaglia et al 1995 simulate the scattering contributions from soil vegetation systems based on prescribed electromagnetic characteristics this supports the application of these models to various site conditions and sensor configurations paloscia et al 2013 petropoulos et al 2015 the understanding of backscattering processes baghdadi et al 2002 balenzano et al 2012 wang et al 2018 and the propagation of uncertainty sources satalino et al 2002 van der velde et al 2012a surface scattering models including the frequently used iem model simulate the scattering of electromagnetic waves from a surface and are used to estimate the σ 0 from soils ulaby and long 2014 the surface roughness essentially governs the σ 0 response and thus the sensitivity to smc the parameterisation of the surface roughness is therefore an important input measuring the surface roughness was part of many field campaigns such as emac 94 su et al 1997 floodgen in 1994 1998 and 1999 baghdadi et al 2004 orgeval 94 zribi et al 1997 ope3 in 2002 joseph et al 2010 smapvex12 mcnairn et al 2015 smapvex16 ia hornbuckle et al 2017 and smapvex16 mb mcnairn et al 2016 however baghdadi et al 2002 baghdadi et al 2004 and su et al 1997 have shown that the iem model does not accurately reproduce σ 0 observations using measured surface roughness parameters lievens et al 2011 and verhoest et al 2008 attributed this to both uncertainties in the surface roughness measurements and simplifications in the representation of surfaces a pragmatic approach for applying surface scattering models to land surfaces is considering the surface roughness parameters as effective parameters obtained by model calibration instead of field measurements baghdadi et al 2002 lievens et al 2011 lievens and verhoest 2012 rahman et al 2008 su et al 1997 verhoest et al 2008 verhoest et al 2007 the calibration of the surface roughness parameters is accomplished by searching for a parameter set that results in a match between σ 0 observations and model simulations subsequently the calibrated surface roughness parameters can be used to retrieve smc from other σ 0 observations and or on other fields su et al 1997 in addition to the surface roughness parameterisation the smc estimates from σ 0 observations will contain uncertainties specific for the selected retrieval algorithm de lannoy et al 2014 pathe et al 2009 and due to uncertainty in the σ 0 observations benninga et al 2019 pathe et al 2009 the σ 0 observations contain uncertainty from calibration uncertainties sensor instabilities and speckle effects which are together referred to as radiometric uncertainty benninga et al 2019 furthermore smc references are required for the calibration of scattering models and the validation of the smc retrievals the smc references are typically obtained from in situ measurements this introduces uncertainties due to a smc probe s measurement uncertainty cosh et al 2005 and spatial scale mismatches with satellite observed smc western and blöschl 1999 cosh et al 2006 a horizontal spatial scale mismatch between the smc at an in situ monitoring station and field averaged smc originates from differences in land cover soil texture and structure and local features such as nearby ditches and subsurface drainage pipes a vertical spatial scale mismatch originates from the sentinel 1 c band σ 0 observations having a sampling depth that varies from the surface to a depth of1cm to 10cm nolan and fatland 2003 ulaby et al 1996 whereas in practice smc measurements at 5cm or 10cm depth with an influence zone of e g 4cm above and below the probe benninga et al 2018 often have to be adopted for calibration and validation purposes e g bauer marschallinger et al 2019 chan et al 2018 kornelsen and coulibaly 2013 pathe et al 2009 van der velde et al 2015 information on the uncertainty of smc retrievals is essential to assess their reliability and for their applicability for example for the assimilation of smc retrievals into land surface models and for combining smc products pierdicca et al 2014 verhoest et al 2007 de lannoy et al 2014 verhoest et al 2007 estimated the uncertainty of smc retrievals with the iem model by defining uncertainty distributions for the surface roughness parameters as a result of assumed surface roughness parameter uncertainties of 7 5 15 and 25 verhoest et al 2007 reported smc retrieval uncertainties standard deviations of 0 023 m3 m 3 0 041 m3 m 3 and 0 060 m3 m 3 respectively vernieuwe et al 2011 continued on the study by verhoest et al 2007 by considering the correlation between the parameters based on a synthetically generated surface roughness data set doubková et al 2012 and pathe et al 2009 estimated the uncertainty of smc retrievals from parameter uncertainty assumptions and the radiometric uncertainty pulvirenti et al 2018 defined fuzzy logic rules in order to assign a degree of uncertainty low medium high to each smc retrieval these previous studies however relied on assumptions regarding the uncertainty of model parameters for the estimation of the smc retrieval uncertainty this is reflected in the applied calibration methods in general which ignore uncertainties and aim for one optimal parameter set that results in a match between observations and simulations e g joseph et al 2008 lievens et al 2011 verhoest et al 2007 bayesian calibration approaches allow for the derivation of parameter distributions and the separation of parameter uncertainty from the total simulation uncertainty based on statistical assumptions of which the validity can be verified barber et al 2012 de lannoy et al 2014 haddad et al 1996 notarnicola et al 2006 notarnicola and posa 2004 pierdicca et al 2014 for example using semi empirical oh surface scattering models oh et al 1992 oh et al 2002 haddad et al 1996 pierdicca et al 2014 and pierdicca et al 2010 formulated bayesian frameworks for the retrieval of surface roughness parameters and smc along with estimates of their retrieval uncertainty bayesian frameworks cannot be solved analytically for highly nonlinear models vrugt 2016 such as physically based scattering models to provide an efficient solution for such models the differential evolution adaptive metropolis package dream vrugt 2016 implements a multi chain markov chain monte carlo simulation algorithm for generating samples from the posterior distributions that describe the parameter uncertainty and the total simulation uncertainty de lannoy et al 2014 used dream to calibrate a radiative transfer model for simulating smos l band brightness temperatures and to estimate the uncertainty of the parameters and the total simulation uncertainty in this study the uncertainties involved in surface scattering model simulations and smc retrievals were investigated we focused on the calibration of the iem surface roughness parameters and therefore used sentinel 1 σ 0 observations and smc measurements from sparsely vegetated fields namely two meadows and two fallow cultivated parcels the bayesian calibration was performed with dream the paper extends on previous research on smc retrieval from sar σ 0 observations by 1 adopting a bayesian calibration framework for deriving the uncertainty of the iem surface roughness parameters and the total uncertainty 2 assessing the derived smc retrieval uncertainty against the uncertainty estimated empirically using in situ references and 3 decomposing the total uncertainty in its four constituents 2 definitions of uncertainties the standard deviation is selected as uncertainty measure the standard deviation of the differences between two data sets such as smc retrievals and references is often referred to as the unbiased root mean square deviation urmsd kerr et al 2016 1 urmsd t 1

retrieval its total uncertainty and constituents are illustrated in fig 1 the surface roughness parameters for retrieving the smc as well as the parameter uncertainty u p and total uncertainty were derived with bayesian calibrations using dream as described in section 4 we refer to the total uncertainty that is derived with the bayesian calibration as u total b the surface roughness parameter set with the highest posterior probability also referred to as the maximum a posteriori map vrugt 2016 de lannoy et al 2014 lu et al 2017 was used for the optimal smc retrieval u total b should be of similar magnitude as the empirical uncertainty of smc retrievals for cases that the bayesian calibration was statistically valid de lannoy et al 2014 the empirical smc retrieval uncertainty can be calculated with eq 1 using in situ references the u total b and u p are visualized by two histograms in fig 1 which partly overlap and show that the distribution of the u total b is wider than the distribution of the u p this is expected as u p is one of the constituents of the total uncertainty the other constituents are inherent to the in situ references and the satellite observations namely the measurement uncertainty of the station probes providing the in situ references u sp the in situ references uncertainty attributable to a spatial scale mismatch with sentinel 1 observed smc u s s 1 and sentinel 1 s radiometric uncertainty u s 1 fig 1 illustrates that u sp and u s s 1 apply to the in situ references and u s 1 applies to the smc retrievals in section 3 the u sp u s s 1 and u s 1 are quantified next to its estimation with the bayesian calibration the total uncertainty can be found by combining its constituents this is referred to as u total c and can be calculated by following the addition rule for variances moore et al 2017 2 u total c u sp 2 u s s 1 2 u s 1 2 u p 2 cov where cov stands for the covariance terms between the uncertainty constituents the constituents are assumed to be uncorrelated whereby cov reduces to 0 the relative contributions of u sp u s s 1 u s 1 and u p can then be calculated in a similar fashion as was done in van der velde et al 2012b 3 rc sp u sp 2 u total c 2 4 rc s s 1 u s s 1 2 u total c 2 5 rc s 1 u s 1 2 u total c 2 and 6 rc p u p 2 u total c 2 with eq 2 we can evaluate to what extent u total c explains u total b and with eqs 3 6 we can assess their individual relative contributions 3 data 3 1 study region fields and periods the smc measurements used as references were collected by monitoring stations in the twente region

march 2018 for the validation of σ 0 simulations and smc retrievals the study periods are taken outside the growing season from october after harvesting and other agricultural practices to march before ploughing and sowing so that the fields were fallow or covered with non growing sparse vegetation and no agricultural practices were applied during the study periods in between the winter seasons several agricultural practices are applied on cultivated fields field iii and iv such as sowing harvesting manuring and ploughing on meadows field i and ii typically no ploughing is applied and the surface roughness is expected to change little table 2 lists the land covers at the locations of the smc monitoring stations and on the study fields during the calibration and validation period field i and ii are covered with grass which is virtually static and sparse during winters field measurements with the li cor lai 2000 li cor 1992 indicated leaf area indices lai of 1 1m2 m 2 and 1 3m2 m 2 outside the growing season versus maximums of 8 0m2 m 2 and 7 7m2 m 2 in the growing season for field i and ii respectively benninga et al 2020a field iii and iv were fallow with remaining maize stubble in the winter of 2016 2017 in the winter of 2017 2018 field iii was again fallow with maize stubble whereas field iv was used to grow winter wheat table 2 indicates that also the land cover at station iv changed between the calibration and the validation period this station was installed on 20 may 2016 in the first period after installation the land cover at the station s location was similar to the study field the second year it was covered with grassy vegetation because the area with the station probes was no longer directly subjected to agricultural practices 3 2 soil moisture content references the smc monitoring stations are equipped with 5tm probes meter group 2019 installed at nominal depths of 5cm 10cm 20cm 40cm and 80cm of which the readings are stored every 15 min we used the 5cm smc measurements collected at sentinel 1 overpass times as the in situ references the probes at 5cm depth provide an integrated measurement over a soil depth of 1cm to 9cm benninga et al 2018 the smc measurements inside the study fields revealed an inconsistency in the station measurements of field iv during the period may 2016 november 2016 the station measurements had a bias of 0 024m3 m 3 with respect to the field measurements whereas for the period april 2017 september 2017 the bias increased to 0 12m3 m 3 see table s3 this likely is a consequence of the change in the land cover at the station s location from fallow with maize stubble to grassy vegetation see table 2 and section 3 1 3 2 1 measurement uncertainty a soil specific calibration function was developed for the station probes of the twente network van der velde et al in review 2019 the calibration accuracy quantified by eq 1 between the calibrated probe measurements and gravimetrically determined volumetric smc gvsmc references is 0 027 m3 m 3 we adopted this value as general measure for the u sp 3 2 2 spatial scale mismatch uncertainty the horizontal and vertical spatial scale mismatches have a systematic and a variable impact on differences between the smc references and sentinel 1 observed smc the systematic component is a bias which will implicitly be accounted for via the calibration of the surface roughness parameters the variable component is u s s 1 which contributes to the uncertainty of sentinel 1 smc retrievals the u s s 1 was quantified by eq 1 between the station measurements and the spatial mean of the 0cm 5cm layer smc measurements inside field i iv supplement 2 provides further information on the estimation of u s s 1 the values for u s s 1 in table s3 demonstrate that adopting the station measurements as reference for the sentinel 1 smc retrievals introduces a significant amount of uncertainty varying from 0 036 m3 m 3 to 0 068 m3 m 3 we adopted the mean of 0 051 m3 m 3 over field i iv as the common measure for u s s 1 3 3 sentinel 1 imagery 3 3 1 data processing the sentinel 1 constellation provides images in c band 5 405ghz over land in interferometric wide swath iw mode at vv and vh polarization we only used the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations in vv polarization because of the higher expected sensitivity to smc than the vh polarization e g amazirh et al 2018 el hajj et al 2017 and because the definitions of the surface roughness parameters in the iem model are different for vv and vh due to underlying assumptions the radiometric accuracy is specified at 1db three standard deviations after multi looking the ground range detected grd high resolution hr product has a resolution of 20 m 22 m 4 4 equivalent number of looks torres et al 2012 bourbigot et al 2016 to obtain sentinel 1 backscatter σ 0 we downloaded level 1 grd hr iw sentinel 1 images from the copernicus open access hub copernicus 2019 and processed them using the following operations in esa s sentinel application platform snap v6 0 european space agency 2019 1 apply orbit file 2 thermal noise removal and 3 range doppler terrain correction including radiometric normalization to σ 0 in m2 m 2 with projected local incidence angles on a geographic grid wgs84 with a pixel spacing of 9 0e 5 equivalent to 10m 6 1m at the study region s latitude subsequently the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations were averaged over the study fields excluding a 20 m distance from the borders of the fields and 40 m from trees and buildings to avoid possible influences of features outside the fields see the net area in table 2 the last step was to convert the σ 0 values to decibel db table 3 specifies the orbits that cover the study region sentinel 1a provides images since 3 october 2014 and sentinel 1b since 28 september 2016 the combination of sentinel 1a and sentinel 1b gives a temporal resolution of 1 5 days over the study region however frozen conditions wet snow and intercepted rain can disturb σ 0 observations and we masked the sentinel 1 observations for these weather related surface conditions with the masking rules presented in benninga et al 2019 which are summarized in supplement 3 furthermore in situ references that decreased during frozen soil periods van der velde et al in review 2019 were removed and from 18 january 2018 to 16 march 2018 the smc monitoring station adjacent to field ii was malfunctioning and no references are available for this period table 4 lists the number of sentinel 1 observations with a matching in situ reference before and after masking for the above mentioned weather related surface conditions 3 3 2 radiometric uncertainty sentinel 1 s radiometric uncertainty s s 1 indb was estimated by the standard deviation of sentinel 1 σ 0 observations from a target which is assumed time invariant benninga et al 2019 this resulted in a second order power function between s s 1 and the surface area over which the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations are averaged the smc retrieval uncertainty due to the s s 1 being u s 1 is then derived through combination with the σ 0 to smc sensitivity which follows from simulations with the iem model 4 methods 4 1 surface scattering model application iem is a physically based surface scattering model fung et al 1992 that has widely been used to simulate the σ 0 from bare and sparsely vegetated land surfaces readers are referred to ulaby and long 2014 for more background on the iem model and to kornelsen and coulibaly 2013 for a discussion of previous studies in which iem was used vegetation effects are not accounted for by the iem model and accordingly we limited the calibration and validation periods to the fallow or non growing sparse vegetation conditions outside the growing season see section 3 1 the applicability of the iem model to sparse grass covers is justified by the results of van der velde and su 2009 and van der velde et al 2012a van der velde and su 2009 found that for c band σ 0 observations the effects of grass with a normalized difference vegetation index ndvi varying from 0 15 in winters to 0 55 in summers are small throughout the entire year these ndvi values correspond to lai values of approximately 0 38 m2 m 2 to 1 63 m2 m 2 knyazikhin et al 1999 tesemma et al 2014 which is comparable to our lai measurements outside the growing season moreover the smc retrieval uncertainties attributable to vegetation effects were found to be fairly small compared to uncertainties caused by the surface roughness parameterisation van der velde et al 2012a the iem model requires parameterisations on the dielectric and geometric properties of the land surface the dielectric properties were estimated with the mironov soil dielectric mixing model mironov et al 2009 smc and the soil textures from supplement 1 served as input to the mironov model the geometry of the land also known as the surface roughness is parameterised by the root mean square surface height s the autocorrelation length c l and an autocorrelation function the exponential autocorrelation function was selected because it is viewed as most appropriate for agricultural fields ulaby and long 2014 verhoest et al 2008 callens et al 2006 have shown that changes in surface roughness due to heavy rainfall are limited when no agricultural practices were applied recently the study periods were taken such that no agricultural practices were applied within them see section 3 1 and therefore surface roughness can be assumed time invariant this assumption is discussed in section 5 3 agricultural surfaces are generally anisotropic verhoest et al 2008 and the fields are viewed from a different direction in sentinel 1 s ascending and descending orbits causing that the surface roughness would be different for these orbits this is especially expected for the fallow maize fields which have tillage rows see fig 3 the meadows do not have a clear row structure the anisotropy of the study fields was considered by separating the calibration of s and c l for the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations made in the ascending and in the descending orbits by combining the two ascending orbits 15 and 88 and the two descending orbits 37 and 139 respectively the surface roughness parameters were calibrated on two incidence angles see table 3 and the varying smc conditions encountered during the calibration period 4 2 bayesian model calibration bayesian model calibration derives posterior parameter distributions conditioned on prior parameter distributions prior and the match between model simulations and reference data likelihood by solving bayes rule vrugt 2016 7 p θ z likelihood prior where p θ z is the resulting posterior probability density function pdf of the parameters θ given the reference data z the likelihood function evaluates how well the model reproduces z given θ by describing the pdf of the residuals between simulations and references the generalized likelihood function derived by schoups and vrugt 2010 offers a wide flexibility in heteroscedasticity distribution and autocorrelation of the residuals the likelihood model parameters have to be inferred jointly with the model parameters or must be given a fixed value the validity of the residual model can be verified with a residual analysis for more background on residual analysis readers are referred to lu et al 2017 scharnagl et al 2011 schoups and vrugt 2010 and thyer et al 2009 4 3 application of dream we adopted a simple implementation of the generalized likelihood function and assumed homoscedastic gaussian and uncorrelated residuals these assumptions are often made and convenient to use e g lu et al 2017 raj et al 2018 scharnagl et al 2011 and lead to the common standard least squares approach schoups and vrugt 2010 in section 5 1 the validity of the residual model is verified with a residual analysis the standard deviation of the residuals σ 0 has to be inferred with the calibration the two surface roughness parameters in combination with σ 0 bring the dimensionality number of unknowns at three the validity of the iem model is limited to medium surface roughness conditions with ks 3 where k is the free space wavenumber baghdadi et al 2004 su et al 1997 for the wavelength of sentinel 1 this corresponds to a maximum s of 2 68cm for c l no iem validity domain has been formulated calibration ranges of 0 2cm to 400cm have been used and the resulting calibrated c l values ranged from 1 4cm to 13cm for maize and bare agricultural fields joseph et al 2010 joseph et al 2008 lievens et al 2011 satalino et al 2002 verhoest et al 2007 and from 0 2cm to 7cm for a mosaic of grasslands and wetlands van der velde et al 2012a non informative uniform priors are preferred for scientific objectivity lunn et al 2013 notarnicola and posa 2004 notarnicola et al 2006 we defined the prior distributions as uniform distributions with the ranges 0 1cm 2 68cm for s and 0 1cm 100cm for c l the prior distribution of σ 0 is defined as a uniform distribution with ranges 0db 2db we used the standard dream settings vrugt 2016 with ten markov chains a burn in of 50 of the realizations is recommended to allow initialization to the posterior parameter distributions vrugt 2016 convergence of the chains was assessed by the multivariate gelman rubin convergence diagnostic r d where r d below 1 2 indicates convergence brooks and gelman 1998 vrugt 2016 and by visual inspection of the mixing of the markov chains raj et al 2018 vrugt 2016 7000 realizations per chain appeared sufficient to reach convergence after 50 of the realizations which results in 35000 samples describing the posterior parameter distributions 4 4 soil moisture content retrieval the map surface roughness parameter set was used for the optimal σ 0 simulations and smc retrievals these were evaluated against the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations and in situ smc references respectively with the root mean square deviation rmsd the unbiased rmsd urmsd and the pearson correlation coefficient r p defined in supplement 4 for the retrieval of smc from the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations we generated look up tables of σ 0 simulations for smc values ranging from 0 01 m3 m 3 to 0 75 m3 m 3 with an increment of 0 001 m3 m 3 and combinations of soil textures incidence angles and surface roughness parameter sets a smc retrieval is then taken equal to the smc value for which the minimum difference between σ 0 simulations and a sentinel 1 σ 0 observation is found for deriving u total b we generated 1000 σ 0 residual samples from the skew exponential power distribution that underlies the likelihood function schoups and vrugt 2010 using the σ 0 that was found for the map surface roughness parameter set the resulting 1000 smc retrievals with the map surface roughness parameters after superimposing the σ 0 residual samples on a sentinel 1 σ 0 observation describe u total b for the computation of u p we randomly sampled 1000 surface roughness parameter sets from their posterior distributions and derived 1000 smc retrievals 5 results and discussion 5 1 residual analysis the residual analysis plots for the bayesian calibrations are included in supplement 5 1 the figures a in figs s1 s4 show for fields i to iv that the residual variances are generally independent of the simulated σ 0 which justifies the use of a homoscedastic residual model the figures b show that the deviations from the theoretical quantiles for a gaussian distribution are only substantial for a few σ 0 simulations at the tails and not systematic among the calibration cases so we accepted the validity of the gaussian residual distribution only for field iv a number of outliers can be observed which is further discussed with regard to the σ 0 simulations in section 5 3 the calibration cases show some autocorrelation with mean values of 0 40 at a lag of one time step and 0 28 at a lag of two time steps figures c in figs s1 s4 in the bayesian calibration of process models such as rainfall runoff models schoups and vrugt 2010 and terrestrial ecosystem models lu et al 2017 autocorrelation in the residuals can be accounted for with autoregressive residual models however the iem model does not contain state variables using autoregressive residual models therefore does not change the posterior parameter distributions nor the residual analysis plots of our calibration results in supplement 6 this is demonstrated by showing for field i the calibration results obtained with a first order and a second order autoregressive residual model supplement 5 2 contains the residual analysis plots for the validation period figs s5 s8 show that the homoscedastic gaussian residual model is generally also valid for the validation period the quantile quantile plots already give an outlook on the performances of the σ 0 simulations and smc retrievals in the validation period regarding field i the quantile quantile plot fig s5b is steeper larger dispersion than the quantile quantile plot for the calibration period and it reveals a bias compare to the plot s origin 0 0 hence a slightly degraded performance and a bias are expected for the validation period for field ii the quantile quantile plots for the calibration and the validation period figs s2b and s6b are comparable so we expect similar performances for field iii fig s7b and field iv fig s8b steep lines and high biases are observed suggesting worse performances for the validation period 5 2 posterior parameter distributions figs 4 7 show the posterior parameter sets and the map s and c l for fields i to iv joseph et al 2008 lievens et al 2011 rahman et al 2008 and verhoest et al 2007 already reported that multiple optimal combinations of s and c l are possible the scatter plots in figs 4 7 illustrate that the posterior distributions of the surface roughness parameters actually cover a large part of the solution space and that the s and c l are highly correlated spearman s rank correlation coefficient r s is 0 97 to 1 0 individual values of s or c l therefore do not contain much information about the surface roughness for example s values of 0 5cm to 1 5cm are found in the posterior parameter distributions of all the fields hence both s and c l or a ratio between them should be used to characterize the roughness of a surface from figs 4 7 it is clear that the relation between s and c l is non linear and that the simple s c l ratio will not suffice instead it is approximately a square root relation and the parameter z s s 2 c l zribi and dechambre 2002 is suitable for characterizing the roughness of the surfaces for the meadows figs 4 and 5 the ascending and the descending orbits posterior distributions coincide in other words the surface roughness is similar for the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations made in the ascending and in the descending orbits this is an indication that the meadows have an isotropic surface roughness at least in sentinel 1 s ascending and descending orbit viewing directions therefore we also calibrated the surface roughness parameters with the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations from both passes combined of which the results are also shown in figs 4 and 5 the parameter sets obtained from the combined calibration were used in the remainder of this paper furthermore the posterior parameter distributions of the two meadows are quite similar the map s values are 0 16cm and 0 18cm and the c l values are 1 31cm and 1 49cm for field i and field ii respectively in section 5 3 we discuss the cross validation results of the map surface roughness parameters of field i applied to retrieve the smc for field ii and vice versa for the fallow maize fields figs 6 and 7 the ascending and the descending orbits posterior distributions are different this was expected as these fields do have an anisotropic surface due to tillage rows and these are viewed from different angles in the ascending and descending orbits 5 3 retrievals the map smc retrievals u p and u total b are plotted as time series in fig 8 and table 5 lists the performance metrics of the map smc retrievals for the calibration and the validation period time series and performance metrics of the forward σ 0 simulations using the smc references and calibrated surface roughness parameters as input to the iem model are shown in fig 9 and table 6 respectively 5 3 1 meadows the performance of the meadows map σ 0 simulations is comparable for the calibration and the validation period this indicates that the surface roughness remained similar which can be explained by the fact that no ploughing was applied on the meadows the increase in the empirical uncertainty urmsd eq 1 of the smc retrievals can be explained by the wetter conditions during the validation period iem model simulations show that the σ 0 to smc sensitivity diminishes with increasing smc see for example fig 3 in altese et al 1996 and the results in benninga et al 2019 which results in larger smc deviations for equal σ 0 deviations under wetter conditions because of this the smc retrieval uncertainty distributions in fig 8 are also wider at higher smc and they are skewed towards the higher smc levels the posterior surface roughness parameter distributions and the map values are quite similar for the two meadows to further verify this we performed a cross validation by retrieving the smc for field ii using the map surface roughness parameters of field i and vice versa table 5 lists the smc retrieval performances and supplement 7 includes the smc and σ 0 time series figures the calibration has aimed to optimize the rmsd of the σ 0 simulations so it could be expected that the rmsd for the calibration period is higher using the map parameter set of the other meadow in general the smc retrieval performances are comparable using the map surface roughness parameter sets obtained for the other meadow 5 3 2 fallow fields the validation performances for the fallow fields are considerably worse than the calibration performances field iii was fallow with maize stubble during both the calibration and the validation period but the surface roughness is likely to be different due to agricultural practices in between furthermore figs 8c and 9c show in the validation period three distinctive periods from 14 october 2017 to 10 november 2017 with low smc retrievals high σ 0 simulations from 15 november 2017 to 14 january 2018 with high smc retrievals low σ 0 simulations and from 15 january 2018 to 21 march 2018 with low smc retrievals high σ 0 simulations however the field was harvested in september october 2017 and not ploughed after may 2017 so changes in surface roughness due to agricultural practices and heavy rainfall were not expected this result demonstrates that even under these circumstances the fallow field cannot be simulated with a single set of surface roughness parameters besides sentinel 1 σ 0 observations of up to 3db in the calibration period and 2db in the validation period were acquired for field iii with a maximum of 1 62db these sentinel 1 observations all originate from relative orbit number 15 the iem model with an exponential autocorrelation function for the surface roughness cannot reproduce such high σ 0 observations with any set of surface roughness parameters therefore we omitted the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations of field iii acquired in relative orbit 15 for further analysis in this study an additional calibration was performed exclusively on the sentinel 1 observations acquired in relative orbit 88 of which the results are presented in supplement 8 the posterior parameter distributions fig s14 and the σ 0 simulation performances fig s17 for this calibration are however similar to the calibration on both ascending orbits using the original surface roughness parameter sets and omitting the orbit 15 sentinel 1 σ 0 observations does improve the σ 0 simulation and smc retrieval performances tables 5 and 6 for field iv the validation performances are more degraded than for field iii this can be explained by the different land covers in the calibration and the validation period table 2 and by the bias in the in situ references during the validation period section 3 2 fig 10 a shows the residuals of the map smc retrievals with the original references and with the references corrected for the bias of 0 12 m3 m 3 part of the residuals can indeed be explained by this bias however still three periods can be distinguished in the residuals between 17 october 2017 and the sowing of the winter wheat on 10 november 2017 the rmsd against the bias corrected references is 0 10 m3 m 3 13 observations between 13 november 2017 and 6 december 2017 the rmsd is smallest with a value of 0 050 m3 m 3 10 observations and after 15 december 2017 the rmsd is 0 19 m3 m 3 32 observations the development of the winter wheat vegetation on this field during the validation period does not have a large effect as this should otherwise be visible as a gradual trend in the residuals extending to april 2018 moreover at the end of the validation period the wheat cover is still sparse as is shown in fig 10b a number of heavy rainfall events occurred between 6 december 2017 and 15 december 2017 in total 64 mm callens et al 2006 demonstrated that rainfall smoothens the surface and reduces the surface roughness on recently tilled fields indeed the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations being lower after 15 december 2017 is in accordance with a reduced surface roughness a number of outliers were observed in the residual analysis plots of the calibrations on field iv as visualized in fig s4 the σ 0 simulations in the first part of the calibration period between 14 october 2016 and 6 november 2016 hold the largest residuals and all these residuals are on one side of the quantile quantile plots this indicates that the surface roughness conditions has changed within the calibration period as discussed in the previous paragraphs for both fallow fields the same holds between the calibration and the validation period as well as within the validation periods 5 3 3 note on the soil moisture content references it should be noted that the smc references extend to higher levels than saturated smcs generally observed bofek2012 wösten et al 2013 lists saturated smc values of 0 44 m3 m 3 0 45 m3 m 3 for the surface layers 0cm to 23cm depth of field i to iv these values are exceeded by the station smc measurements this can be partly attributed to higher organic matter content and root density near the soil surface organic matter increases smc values especially in sandy and loamy sandy soils minasny and mcbratney 2018 in addition local soil variability is not captured by bofek2012 local soil variability is not considered in the probes calibration function and roots and macropores in the probes influence zone can increase measured smc benninga et al 2018 however even with consideration of these factors the very high smc measurements especially for field ii seem unrealistic in absolute sense nevertheless the correlations between the station and field measurements listed in table s3 are high it can therefore be expected that the station measurements capture the temporal variability of the adjacent field s smc the absolute smc measurement values may still deviate from realistic values this will affect the surface roughness parameters obtained by the calibration and for the smc retrieval over independent periods or fields it may be necessary to apply an unbiasing procedure this is reflected in the meadows cross validation results see tables 5 and 6 the rmsds which include the bias in the mean are generally higher than the original calibration metrics whereas the r p and urmsds which exclude this bias are comparable 5 4 retrieval uncertainty fig 11 shows u total b in comparison to the uncertainty of the map smc retrievals estimated empirically using the smc references and fig 12 shows u total b relative to u total c for bins of smc references the empirical uncertainty is quantified with eq 1 but without removing the bias for each bin separately to preserve the integrity of the time series pdfs for field i and ii both the calibration and the validation period are included figs 11a and b since it was found that the parameters calibrated for the cultivated fields field iii and iv are invalid for the validation period the latter period is not included in figs 11c f as a consequence of that and because the ascending and descending orbits are separated for field iii and iv the total number of pairs is larger for field i and ii and for visualization purposes the number of pairs per bin in figs 11 and 12 is ten for field i and ii and five for field iii and iv the increasing empirical uncertainty and u total b with increasing smc in fig 11 are explained by the diminishing σ 0 to smc sensitivity with increasing smc as was discussed in section 5 3 1 both the increasing trend and the magnitude of the empirical uncertainty are rather closely approximated by u total b in other words the smc retrieval uncertainty derived with the bayesian calibration does successfully reproduce the uncertainty estimated empirically this does however not hold for field iv as explained in section 5 3 2 the iem model does not correctly reproduce the σ 0 of field iv within the calibration period with a single set of surface roughness parameters as a consequence the likelihood function implementation with a homoscedastic residual standard deviation is not valid over the complete calibration period fig 12 shows that the combination of u sp u s s 1 u s 1 and u p i e u total c approximately explains u total b except for field iv again fig 12 also shows the relative squared contributions of u sp u s s 1 u s 1 and u p namely rc sp rc s s 1 rc s 1 and rc p the rc p is relatively small and constant across the investigated smc domain with an average of 13 over the smc domain and fields i to iii this means that the u p increases with smc because the total uncertainty increases with increasing smc from the assumption that u sp and u s s 1 are equal to 0 027 m3 m 3 and 0 051 m3 m 3 across the entire smc domain follows that their relative contributions rc sp and rc s s 1 decrease with increasing smc because the total uncertainty increases with smc the average rc sp and rc s s 1 decrease respectively from 13 and 46 at a smc of 0 26 m3 m 3 to 4 and 15 at a smc of 0 53 m3 m 3 the average rc s 1 increases from 31 at a smc of 0 26 m3 m 3 to 67 at a smc of 0 53 m3 m 3 which is explained by the increasing u s 1 with increasing smc benninga et al 2019 the u s 1 is found to be the dominant driver for the increasing smc retrieval uncertainty with increasing smc for field iii the rc s 1 is even larger than for the other fields at an equal smc level because of field iii s smaller surface area 6 conclusions the total uncertainty and its constituents were investigated for smc retrievals from sentinel 1 σ 0 observations over four sparsely vegetated fields two meadows and two fallow cultivated fields a bayesian framework was used for calibrating the surface roughness parameters that are input to the iem surface scattering model and for deriving the parameter and total uncertainty distributions subsequently these distributions were used to retrieve the smc and its uncertainty and the relative contributions of four uncertainty sources were evaluated this resulted in the following conclusions 1 the simplest implementation of the likelihood function using a homoscedastic gaussian residual model describes the simulation residuals an exception is when the iem model is not capable of reproducing the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations in a calibration or validation period with a single set of surface roughness parameters 2 the surface roughness parameters s and c l are highly correlated with spearman s rank correlation coefficients r s of 0 97 to 1 0 the s and c l have approximately a square root relation and the parameter z s s 2 c l which was already introduced in zribi and dechambre 2002 is shown to be suitable for characterizing the roughness of the surfaces this result also implies that it is valid to fix one of the parameters s or c l for simplifying the calibration while still acquiring the same posterior z s distribution 3 for the two meadows the surface roughness parameter distributions coincide for sentinel 1 s ascending and descending orbits despite the different directions from which sentinel 1 views the fields in these passes furthermore the surface roughness parameter distributions of the two meadows are quite similar in contrast for the two fallow fields the surface roughness parameter distributions depend on the pass direction and the distributions differ between the two fields this is attributed to the anisotropic nature of these surfaces caused by tillage rows 4 the performance of the smc retrievals for the calibration period expressed by the rmsd is between 0 076 m3 m 3 and 0 13 m3 m 3 the validation results for an independent period confirm that for the meadows the surface roughness parameters can be used across years for the fallow fields however the surface roughness conditions change not only between the calibration and the validation period but even within single winter periods 5 the total smc retrieval uncertainty derived with the bayesian calibration successfully reproduces the uncertainty estimated empirically using in situ references including the trend of increasing uncertainty with increasing smc 6 the in situ references measurement uncertainty u sp and spatial scale mismatch uncertainty u s s 1 the smc retrieval uncertainty due to sentinel 1 s radiometric uncertainty u s 1 and the parameter uncertainty u p constitute the total uncertainty the main uncertainty originates from the in situ references and the sentinel 1 σ 0 observations whereas the contribution from the surface roughness parameters is relatively small the two meadows coinciding surface roughness parameter distributions for the ascending and descending orbits their similar surface roughness and consistent smc retrievals for the calibration and validation period are promising results for operational retrieval of smc over meadows the value of such a smc product would be substantial as meadows cover a major portion of the land in use for agriculture e g 71 in the study region twente and 55 in the netherlands in 2017 ministerie van economische zaken 2017 therefore further research to the selection of a common surface roughness parameter set for meadows and the associated retrieval uncertainty would be interesting to improve the performance of the sentinel 1 smc retrievals it will be essential to reduce the in situ references uncertainties and the radiometric uncertainty the references uncertainties can be reduced by averaging multiple spatially distributed measurements reducing the impact of radiometric uncertainty can be achieved by accepting a coarser spatial resolution or a further improvement of the sar image processing by the bayesian calibration of the iem model further insights into the surface roughness of agricultural fields and smc retrieval uncertainties have been derived these insights can be used to guide sar based smc product developments moreover the study shows the utility of bayesian calibration approaches

8586,we present a novel technology for monitoring changes in aquifer depth using handpump vibration data this builds on our previous works using data to track handpump usage and facilitate handpump maintenance systems in rural parts of kenya our motivation is to develop a cost effective and scalable infrastructure to monitor shallow aquifers in regions where handpumps are already part of water infrastructure but where traditional sources of groundwater monitoring data may be limited or non existent the data is generated using accelerometer sensors attached to the handles of nine handpumps in the study site in kenya instrumented for a year these time series data from handpumps are individually modelled using machine learning methods to track the changes in the water level with respect to the bottom of the rising main results show promise in modelling handpump vibration data with machine learning approaches to provide useful aquifer monitoring information from the accidental infrastructure of community handpumps this technology is intended to complement existing hydrogeological modelling and one of our key future goals is to integrate these machine learning outputs with hydrogeological information to develop more refined and robust models for shallow aquifer monitoring keywords aquifer monitoring water column handpumps machine learning lstm novel techniques 1 introduction groundwater is directly linked to united nations sustainable development goal 6 sdg 6 clean water and sanitation for all by 2030 un 2018 it is also inexplicably linked to other sdgs related to poverty eradication food security gender equality sustainability of cities and human settlement combating climate change and protecting terrestrial ecosystems hope and rouse 2013 howard 2014 un 2018 wwap 2019 it is estimated that groundwater provides around 50 of all drinking water and 40 of all agricultural irrigation worldwide fao 2011 in africa groundwater is the major source of drinking water and its use for irrigation is expected to increase substantially to tackle growing food insecurity macdonald et al 2012 the magnitude of groundwater s significance is in sharp contrast to the dearth of reliable quantitative information on groundwater resources especially in africa macdonald et al 2012 fan et al 2013 un 2018 available data on global groundwater storage estimates often based on decade old studies with large uncertainties limit effective governance of groundwater systems richey et al 2015 like any other resources groundwater resource management requires monitoring to make informed plans by water users and water service providers at regional and national levels however long term monitoring data are often scarce in africa and wherever data are available inconsistencies in methodologies used at different times make comparisons difficult and trend unclear comte et al 2016 traditional groundwater monitoring technologies xu et al 2012 van camp et al 2013 kelbe et al 2016 are often data resource and time intensive recent efforts have shown remote sensing observations can provide useful cost effective auxiliary data to improve global groundwater estimates richey et al 2015 we propose a novel complementary shallow aquifer monitoring technology that utilizes the continent s existing handpump infrastructure handpumps remain a reliable and low cost method to access groundwater in the context of rural water supply for around 200 million people in sub saharan africa thomson et al 2012 we aim to explore if a network of these handpumps can potentially provide auxillary information that can be exploited using machine learning approaches to monitor the underlying shallow aquifer systems previous efforts have shown that vibration data collected at the handpump s handle are indicative of pump malfunction thomson et al 2012 greeff et al 2019 changes in the characteristics of vibration data potentially due to handpump malfunction can be tracked using novelty detection approaches higher novelty scores signify departure from normal operating conditions remote transmission of these novelty scores as part of a handpump maintenance infrastructure can be used for rapid pump maintenance the changes in vibration data were shown to be indicative of changes in the water level at the borehole under controlled circumstances colchester et al 2014 colchester et al 2017 these works showed that the vibration generated at the handpump s handle are affected by the weight of the system i e the weight of the rods and the volume of water inside the rising main in general the deeper the water level the higher the volume of water inside the rising main and the stronger the observed vibration the variation in vibration characteristics was exploited to estimate the water level at the borehole of the handpump these experiments were performed using two datasets 1 data from a handpump on the university site primarily installed to perform condition monitoring related research and 2 few weeks of data from handpumps in the study site in kenya both datasets were collected under controlled settings i e handpump users were mostly limited to the research team and the pump strokes and duration were fairly consistent given the short data collection period the dataset neither captured long term variation in the aquifer level nor faced challenges commonly encountered during normal operations e g wide variation in the pumping style variation in the water column at different times of the day handpump breakdown and subsequent repairs etc besides for the dataset from the kenya study site instead of actually measuring the varying water column the handpump rod length was used as an approximate measure of the depth of water in the borehole the preliminary results of these experiments motivated this follow up field study to determine if 1 the vibration data obtained from community handpumps in an unconstrained real world setting can be used to track long term changes in aquifer level a conditional yes and 2 the results generalize across different depths of shallow aquifer systems yes provided a handpump maintenance infrastructure is already in place there is an opportunity to dual purpose the vibration data to monitor shallow aquifer at minimal extra cost the distributed maintenance infrastructure greeff et al 2019 allows adaptive transmission of handpump vibration data controlling when and how much of data is transmitted thus saving cost in resource constrained settings the adaptive framework blends in well with the proposed aquifer monitoring system whose predictions are only expected to be based on data from normally operational handpumps this framework is further detailed in section 2 1 1 related works and our contribution machine learning approaches have been explored to understand hydrological processes and facilitate water resource management herrera et al 2010 yaseen et al 2019 achieng 2019 these approaches have also been used to model variations in aquifer level based on hydro climatic data e g rainfall temperature nayak et al 2006 behzad et al 2010 yoon et al 2011 taormina et al 2012 tapoglou et al 2014 suryanarayana et al 2014 sahoo et al 2017 these efforts have mostly implemented standard regression approaches e g support vector regression svr bishop 2006 gaussian processes gps rasmussen 2004 multi layer perceptron regression mlp regression robert 2014 or various hybrid combinations of the same a recent work has shown long short term memory networks lstms outperformed standard mlp regression to predict water table depth by using 14 years of monthly water diversion evaporation precipitation temperature and time as input data zhang et al 2018 these efforts show the potential of using machine learning approaches to predict long term changes in aquifer level in areas where hydrogeological data are difficult or expensive to obtain the proposed work also compares lstms with mlp regression for aquifer prediction however unlike all prior work the proposed framework is novel because 1 it uses handpump vibration data to model changes in water level and 2 setting aside the specific types of models used the proposed framework combines regression and novelty detection approaches to develop a novel shallow aquifer monitoring technology that is designed to work alongside a handpump maintenance infrastructure the proposed framework can also be extended to incorporate hydro climatic data or outputs from hydrogeological models in an effort to facilitate reproducibility and data reuse the dataset greeff et al 2020 1 1 the dataset will be available at the cited address once the embargo is lifted and the software manandhar 2019 are both made publicly available 2 methods in this work we use a machine learning approach to model water column variation in a borehole based on vibration data observed at the handle of the handpump we note that there are two types of changes in the water level i the daily change in water level due to daily drawdown and recovery and ii the long term seasonal change in water level due to aquifer discharge and recharge in this work we are interested in the latter although modelling the daily cycle is in itself an interesting problem the challenge here is the unavailability of sufficient relevant vibration data because the drawdown occurs rapidly and is often associated with pump priming whose vibration characteristics were observed to be different and the recovery by definition is associated with pump disuse which does not generate any vibration data the majority of the vibration data collected during pumping corresponds to the available daily water level at the borehole which in the long term changes similarly to the daily maximum water level we exploit this long term change in the vibration data to model the long term change in water level at the borehole which we expect to approximately correspond to the variation in the corresponding shallow aquifer from which the water is being drawn out we expect the water column variation in the borehole to approximately correspond to the variation in the corresponding shallow aquifer system from which the water is being drawn out we use a regression model to learn a mapping function from vibration data to water column since we expect vibration data at each handpump to be unique an independent model is learned for each handpump to learn such a model a collection of vibration data and corresponding water column observations are required these data are collected at three different sites three handpumps per site in the study area to test if the model generalizes to different depths of shallow aquifer systems a schematic of the shallow aquifer monitoring framework is shown in fig 1 the proposed framework is designed to work alongside a handpump maintenance system represented by dashed lines and not part of the framework itself the handpump maintenance system monitors the condition of handpumps by tracking the changes in characteristics of vibration data using a novelty detection approach the outputs of this novelty detection approach known as novelty scores may be used to flag a potential pump malfunction if the future vibration data looks substantially different from the previously observed data thus facilitating rapid maintenance greeff et al 2019 the proposed technology is based on vibration data obtained from community handpumps which are regularly used and tend to break down quite frequently once every few months on average depending on the severity of malfunction and the type of subsequent repair the characteristics of vibration data may change substantially affecting the outputs of the regression model the vibration data will also change when the water in the borehole reaches previously unobserved levels when the characteristics of the vibration data changes substantially the regression model learned using previously observed vibration data may not provide correct estimation during such circumstances the novelty scores may also serve as a guideline to indicate the confidence in the regression model s outputs where higher novelty scores would correspond to lower confidence in the regression model s outputs when the vibration data has changed due to a pump malfunction and subsequent repair a simple solution to continue using the same regression model may be to calibrate the post repair vibration data back to the pre repair data we propose using a regression model to learn a map from post repair to pre repair vibration data by assuming the vibration data averaged over few days pre vs post repair are the same with respect to the water column estimation model this simple calibration technique inherently assumes the daily maximum height of water column in the borehole does not change substantially in a few days which is generally not a bad assumption based on fig 7 to avoid confusing water column related regression with calibration related regression the latter is referred to as calibration in rest of the document data from nine handpumps are collected for over a year out of which two thirds are used for learning the model i e training for novelty detection and training and validation for regression and the remaining one thirds are used for evaluating the model i e testing 2 1 study area and sample selection the study area is located in kwale county kenya south of mombasa and adjacent to northern tanzania as shown in fig 2 from western shimba hills to eastern coastal plain the area slopes towards the indian ocean the county population of 880 000 people mostly live in rural areas 82 with the majority 70 living below the poverty line of less than usd 1 25 a day knbs 2005 the study area includes the long established coastal tourism industry in diani and the more recent mining and commercial sugar production industries to sustainably manage the resulting competition for water resources reliable data on groundwater is vital a hydrogeological study of the area ferrer et al 2019 reports on the groundwater level change in the coastal coral and sand formations pleistocene magarini kalindini but not the deeper mazeras sandstone during a la nina year they find groundwater levels vary from 4 m below groundwater level bgl to 27 m bgl in response to the wetter and drier periods they also note communities depend on groundwater from boreholes with handpumps as well as open wells in the shallow aquifer in contrast the commercial use for irrigation and mining is largely in the deeper aquifer system with limited interaction with the shallow aquifer the monitoring sites selected for this study are all non commercial community handpumps readers interested in further hydrogeological or socio economic details of the study area may refer to ferrer et al 2019 katuva et al 2019 to test if the model generalizes to handpumps drawing water from different depths of shallow aquifer systems three different monitoring sites are selected corresponding to three different depth ranges shallow medium and deep where these categories are arbitrarily defined based on available samples table 1 summarizes table of columns tocs and water columns wcs at the boreholes at the time of sensor installation we also note that all boreholes were mechanically drilled the rate of daily drawdown recovery as well as long term discharge recharge are expected to differ at these three sites due to different hydrogeological socio economic and other factors besides the water columns in the boreholes in the coast are directly affected by both daily and bi weekly tidal cycles pre processing steps related to removing tidal effects are further described in section 3 1 2 2 regression approaches for water column estimation regression approaches are supervised learning techniques that map examples inputs to continuous labels outputs we use these approaches to map handpump vibration data inputs to their corresponding water column data outputs a wide variety of regression approaches exist e g relevance vector machines rvms gaussian processes gps decision forest tree regression multi layer perceptron regression mlp regression etc although experiments were performed using different types of regression approaches yielding comparable results we focus on mlp also known as feedforward neural network regression because they form a natural baseline to compare with long short term memory lstm networks the primary approach implemented in this work since we wish to provide temporal context to model water column data in terms of past examples of daily handpump vibration data lstms constitute a suitable model for our application 2 2 1 recurrent neural networks rnns feedforward networks do not have feedback i e outputs of the model are not fed back into itself when feedforward networks are extended to include feedback connections they are called recurrent neural networks rnns since feedforward networks assume samples are independent they are unable to utilize information from past samples recurrent neural networks rnns overcome this limitation by allowing information from past samples to persist by using feedback connections they do so by repeating the feedback loop structure recursively to model a sequence of samples as shown in fig 3 the recursive framework allows parameters to be shared across the repetitive structures which in turn makes parameter estimation feasible however although theoretically possible in practice rnns are unable to model long term dependence because gradients propagated over many stages tend to either vanish more common or explode rarely but causing much damage to optimization goodfellow et al 2016 2 2 2 long short term memory lstm networks to solve rnn s long term dependence problem gated rnns are the most effective solutions designed to date they do so by allowing gradients to flow for a long duration using gated self loops examples of gated rnns include long short term memory lstm networks and gated recurrent units grus goodfellow et al 2016 the former being the most widely used lstms have the same basic repetitive structure like rnns except the repeating structure called lstm cell has three gated self loops fig 4 a forget gate decides what information will be discarded from the previous cell state an input gate controls what new information will be stored in the current cell state then the outputs from the forget gate and the input gate are used to update the old cell state into a new cell state finally an output gate decides what information will be output from the new cell state the corresponding equations are 1 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 2 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 3 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c 4 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 5 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 6 h t o t tanh c t where 1 2 4 and 5 6 correspond to respectively forget input and output gates here c t is the current cell state x t is the current input vector h t is the current hidden layer vector containing the oututs of all lstm cells and b s and w s are respectively biases and weights different variations of lstms have been successfully implemented in many applications e g unconstrained handwriting recognition graves et al 2009 speech recognition graves 2013 handwriting generation graves 2013 machine translation sutskever et al 2014 image captioning kiros et al 2014 vinyals et al 2014 rnns and lstms have also been implemented to estimate aquifer using hydro climatic data zhang et al 2018 given the relatively small size of the training data we opt for a simple neural network architecture consisting of a lstm unit a drop out unit to prevent over fitting and a dense layer in sequence fig 5 as more data becomes available in future there are opportunities to implement deeper e g stacked layers and other variations e g shared layers of networks which are further discussed in section 5 the model was implemented in keras using tensorflow backend the model parameters learning rate 10 2 10 5 number of hidden nodes 50 200 epochs 10 200 batch size 10 50 and input time steps 1 14 days were coarsely optimized using separate training and validation sets with 80 20 splits a separate test set one third of data was held out for evaluating the trained model the training validation and test sets were split sequentially in time from past to future to reflect a real implementation scenario 2 3 novelty detection approaches for condition monitoring in a standard binary supervised classification approach bishop 2006 models of normality and abnormality are learned either separately or simultaneously using examples of normal and abnormal observations respectively when there are not enough examples of abnormal observations one way to classify these examples is to only learn a model of normality from normal examples and use this model to classify new examples novelty detection is a type of such one class classification approach which has been applied in many fields including electronic it security healthcare informatics industrial monitoring etc pimentel et al 2014 this approach is very applicable to condition monitoring in handpumps because usually compared to normal handpump operations there are very limited examples of abnormal handpump operations e g broken seal valve or handle malfunction etc different types of novelty detection approaches exist e g k nearest neighbour k nn kernel density estimation kde mixture models one class support vector machines one class svms pimentel et al 2014 bishop 2006 in this work we use a gaussian mixture model gmm bishop 2006 to learn a normal model by representing normal examples with a mixture of multivariate normal densities here an appropriate number of the mixture components is determined based on the data by using dirichlet process mixtures blei and jordan 2006 based on a publicly available toolbox morton and torrione 2013 for each handpump a gaussian mixture model is used to learn a normal model based on daily average frequency features generated from handpump vibration data to help parameter estimation in the mixture model instead of using all 20 frequency bins only the first three principal components are considered which represent more than 95 of total variance in data the mixture model can be used to compute log likelihood of examples the inverse of which can be considered as novelty scores i e lower the log likelihood more novel the examples since gmm provides probabilistic novelty scores it is suitable for our application where we intend to use the novelty scores as a measure of confidence of the regression model s outputs 3 data 3 1 water column data to both learn and evaluate the regression model water column in the borehole represents the ground truth the water column is measured using a diver sensor manufactured by van essen instruments that is fixed close to the bottom of the rising main fig 6 a details the nomenclatures used in this document where water column represents the ground truth for learning the regression model data is collected at a sampling interval of five minutes an example data collected over few days is shown in fig 6b where the blue line shows a typical daily cycle of draw down during the day followed by recovery during the night since our primary goal is to track the variation in the aquifer level we use the daily recovered level approximated by the daily maximum level as the ground truth for modelling water column in the boreholes in the coast is affected by both daily and bi weekly tidal cycles considering the daily maximum level removes the daily cycle blue line in fig 6c and low pass filtering the resulting data removes the bi weekly cycle orange line in fig 6c fig 7 a and c show the change in water column data in the boreholes at three monitoring sites shallow medium and deep with reference to the start date these data have been compensated with respect to the atmospheric pressure and pre processed to represent daily recovered level theoretically a network of these diver sensors would allow us to directly monitor the shallow aquifer without having to do any modelling however given the intended scale of the proposed technology country to sub continent such monitoring program would be cost prohibitively impractical here the costs not only refer to the cost of the sensor but also the ones involved in installing the sensor and downloading the data periodically both extremely laborious process 3 2 handpump vibration data the vibration data is collected using a consumer grade accelerometer sensor attached to the handle of the handpump as shown in fig 8 a the sensor measures accelerometer data in three orthogonal axes at a sampling frequency of 95 hz a typical pumping cycle i e a cycle of the handle being raised and pushed down corresponds to one second interval an example data collected over few pumping cycles is shown in fig 8b in machine learning approaches raw data are often first summarized by useful information known as features before using them to learn a model the low frequency component of the data which corresponds to the pumping motion is found to be uninformative of water column variation the pumping motion is removed using a high pass filter and the resulting high pass filtered time series signal top plot in fig 8c is transformed to frequency domain using a morelet transform the magntiude of the morelet transfrom bottom plot in fig 8c averaged across the time window represents the frequency features corresponding to that window a daily average of these temporal windows along with the corresponding daily maximum water column represent a feature label pair a collection of these feature label pairs per handpump constitutes a training and testing dataset for that handpump vibration data maybe unavailable for a period of time due to several reasons most commonly due to battery or sensor malfunction or handpump disuse a handpump may be temporarily out of operation usually because of malfunction or alternate water sources e g surface water being available during rainy season or school closures in case of handpumps installed at the schools we propose using gaussian processes rasmussen 2004 to impute frequency features corresponding to missing days unfortunately for two handpumps one shallow and one deep too much data were missing to allow reasonable data imputation hence we only report results on the seven remaining handpumps since the highest proportion of data is available for the medium depth handpumps we provide detailed results for that site while only providing key results for the other two sites 4 results the machine learning approaches described in section 2 are used to perform several experiments related to water column estimation using the dataset described in section 3 at this stage our primary goal is to assess the feasibility of the proposed technology in a real world setting i e whether vibration data from a collection of community handpumps at a location can be used to infer the trend in water column variation of the corresponding aquifer 4 1 novelty detection analysis figs 9 11 show the novelty scores of training blue dots and test red dots examples in terms of log likelihood of examples given the normal model in general the examples in future incrementally appear to be more different from the normal examples this trend is expected because the vibration data is expected to change over time either due to gradual pump wear and or change in water level in the borehole to previously unobserved levels a relatively smooth change or due to severe pump malfunction and subsequent repair a relatively abrupt change a continuous drop in the log likelihood suggesting a gradual change in vibration data may correspond to change in water column over time e g fig 10c on the other hand an abrupt change in vibration data due to severe pump malfunction repair often corresponds to a sharp drop in the log likelihood most of these cases e g fig 10a and b etc stand out visually and are aligned to their corresponding pump repair dates black dashed lines whenever the repair dates are available these insights from novelty detection analysis help understand the results of experiments related to calibration and water column estimation 4 2 vibration data calibration usually the novelty scores appear to be higher i e the log likelihood values are lower immediately following a repair e g fig 9b indicating a substantial change in the vibration data after the repair to enable using a single regression model to estimate water column the post repair vibration data is calibrated to match the pre repair data an example of this calibration process is detailed in fig 9 where the top row shows the features generated from the vibration data fig 9a the log likelihoods fig 9b and the water column estimates fig 9c and the bottom row shows the corresponding plots after calibration since a very simple regression model was used to calibrate the vibration data its quality is expected to degrade as further calibrations are performed in future in the example the second calibration does not work as well as the first calibration as part of our future work we intend to explore more principled ways to model this problem e g transfer learning which is discussed in section 5 4 3 water column estimation analysis for medium depth handpumps results are shown for lstm and for reference compared to mlp regression in fig 10 for shallow and deep handpumps results are only shown for lstm in fig 11 in both figures each column corresponds to results for a particular handpump where the rows correspond to the novelty scores novelty scores post calibration lstm estimates and mlp estimates only in fig 10 from top to bottom the estimates for training validation and test sets are shown in blue orange and red colours respectively the estimates are shown in terms of their 95 confidence interval based on 10 iterations of training lstm model with random initialization while parameters for each approach were coarsely optimized using cross validation we have not performed exhaustive parameter optimization because our primary goal at this stage is to assess whether the estimates roughly tracks the true changes in water column rather than obtain the best possible outputs a summary of results for all handpumps for both mlp and lstm techniques are provided in table 2 results show that in general vibration data are indicative of changes in the water column lstm generally outperforms standard mlp regression technique where lstm is expected to perform even better as more training data become available in most cases pump repairs change the vibration data features substantially which when corrected via calibration does somewhat help to improve water column estimation but the frequency and or the nature of repairs may determine the efficacy of the simple calibration technique implemented in this work nevertheless the novelty detection outputs provide a reasonably accurate guideline to determine when to trust the regression model outputs typically a drop in the log likelihood corresponds to either an inaccurate water column estimate or one with high uncertainty the proposed technology is intended to be implemented at scale by concurrently modeling a network of community handpumps rather than estimating continuous changes in water column at individual boreholes our ultimate goal is to use a network of handpumps to infer the overall trend in the water levels in the corresponding shallow aquifer with this goal in mind we plot the fractional change in water columns at the boreholes at two locations with respect to a common reference date fig 12 a and b show these plots for medium and shallow handpumps respectively these results show the estimated changes in water column approximately track the true trend however the estimates deteriorate as we start predicting further ahead in time due to the limitations in the model which are discussed in section 4 4 similar plots are not shown for deep handpumps because the difference in their water column data variation suggests that there may be differences in the hydrogeological dynamics of the aquifers from which the two deep handpumps are drawing water 4 4 limitations despite the resources invested in collecting a unique handpump vibration dataset using novel sensing technology in terms of hydrogeology one year of data is insufficient to track long term changes in aquifer level few years of data may be required to capture a typical range of aquifer level changes in the current dataset validation and test data are often very different from training data complicating both training and testing the model approximately 15 of data were missing usually over continuous streams of time from days to months primarily due to discharged batteries or other hardware related problems handpump malfunction or temporary handpump disuse because of availability of alternate water sources during rainy season e g rain harvesting surface water despite using gaussian processes to impute the missing data the accuracy of the imputed data degrades as the duration of missing data increases the effectiveness of the vibration data calibration technique depends on the frequency and type of handpump repair with the calibration being less effective as the number and or severity of breakdowns repairs increase although the novelty scores provide a guideline to assess the confidence of the water column estimates better techniques are required to model this problem in a principled manner e g transfer learning 5 conclusions the proposed technology based on handpump vibration data and machine learning approaches show promise in providing useful aquifer monitoring information in resource constrained regions where alternate sources of data are either scarce or cost prohibitive and where handpumps already constitute part of the rural water infrastructure in regions where handpump maintenance infrastructure is already in place there is an opportunity to use the vibration data for the additional purpose of providing rudimentary shallow aquifer monitoring at minimal extra cost as expected going from constrained to unconstrained real world environment brings challenges the most pressing one concerns frequent handpump breakdown and subsequent repair that complicates learning a consistent model to estimate changes in water level beside the solutions implemented in this work in the form of novelty scores and vibration data calibration we intend to explore more principled methods in future to model this problem given a pre trained model transfer learning zoph et al 2016 yang et al 2017 allows learning a variation of the learned model for a dataset with different characteristics by only requiring a relatively smaller dataset further field experiments will be required to determine if transfer learning is feasible and how much new data hours days will be required to re train the model we note that in practice the proposed technology is designed to be implemented at scale using a network of handpumps as long as a sufficiently large number of these handpumps at a location are operational the framework may allow useful approximate inference about the underlying aquifer behaviour within a degree of uncertainty further large scale field experiments are required to ascertain the viability of this technology for real world application as well as to determine under which conditions this technology is likely to fail and succeed we note that the proposed technology is aimed to complement cost effectively any traditional hydrogeological models rather than replace them as part of our future work there are opportunities to model multiple handpumps simultaneously and fuse hydro climatic data and wherever available outputs from hydrogeological models multi task learning extensions of lstm liu et al 2016 chen et al 2018 are well suited to model such scenarios given the increasing global importance of groundwater monitoring technology there needs to be more research to fill the gap between available state of the art but cost prohibitive technologies and the capacity of developing nations to adopt them novel cost effective technologies that utilize the available infrastructure of these regions may be a plausible path moving forward given the success and ongoing trials of machine learning approaches to solve global socio developmental challenges beckel et al 2013 blumenstock et al 2015 jean et al 2016 rolnick et al 2019 experimentation of these approaches may provide cost effective complementary options to boost on going progress in hydrogeological modeling to monitor

8586,we present a novel technology for monitoring changes in aquifer depth using handpump vibration data this builds on our previous works using data to track handpump usage and facilitate handpump

2014 un 2018 wwap 2019 it is estimated that groundwater provides around 50 of all drinking water and 40 of all agricultural irrigation worldwide fao 2011 in africa groundwater is the major source of drinking water and its use for irrigation is expected to increase substantially to tackle growing food insecurity macdonald et al 2012 the magnitude of groundwater s significance is in sharp contrast to the dearth of reliable quantitative information on groundwater resources especially in africa macdonald et al 2012 fan et al 2013 un 2018 available data on global groundwater storage estimates often based on decade old studies with large uncertainties limit effective governance of groundwater systems richey et al 2015 like any other resources groundwater resource management requires monitoring to make informed plans by water users and water service providers at regional and national levels however long term monitoring data are often scarce in africa and wherever data are available inconsistencies in methodologies used at different times make comparisons difficult and trend unclear comte et al 2016 traditional groundwater monitoring technologies xu et al 2012 van camp et al 2013 kelbe et al 2016 are often data resource and time intensive recent efforts have shown remote sensing observations can provide useful cost effective auxiliary data to improve global groundwater estimates richey et al 2015 we propose a novel complementary shallow aquifer monitoring technology that utilizes the continent s existing handpump infrastructure handpumps remain a reliable and low cost method to access groundwater in the context of rural water supply for around 200 million people in sub saharan africa thomson et al 2012 we aim to explore if a network of these handpumps can potentially provide auxillary information that can be exploited using machine learning approaches to monitor the underlying shallow aquifer systems previous efforts have shown that vibration data collected at the handpump s handle are indicative of pump malfunction thomson et al 2012 greeff et al 2019 changes in the characteristics of vibration data potentially due to handpump malfunction can be tracked using novelty detection approaches higher novelty scores signify departure from normal operating conditions remote transmission of these novelty scores as part of a handpump maintenance infrastructure can be used for rapid pump maintenance the changes in vibration data were shown to be indicative of changes in the water level at the borehole under controlled circumstances colchester et al 2014 colchester et al 2017 these works showed that the vibration generated at the handpump s handle are affected by the weight of the system i e the weight of the rods and the volume of water inside the rising main in general the deeper the water level the higher the volume of water inside the rising main and the stronger the observed vibration the variation in vibration characteristics was exploited to estimate the water level at the borehole of the handpump these experiments were performed using two datasets 1 data from a handpump on the university site primarily installed to perform condition monitoring related research and 2 few weeks of data from handpumps in the study site in kenya both datasets were collected under controlled settings i e handpump users were mostly limited to the research team and the pump strokes and duration were fairly consistent given the short data collection period the dataset neither captured long term variation in the aquifer level nor faced challenges commonly encountered during normal operations e g wide variation in the pumping style variation in the water column at different times of the day handpump breakdown and subsequent repairs etc besides for the dataset from the kenya study site instead of actually measuring the varying water column the handpump rod length was used as an approximate measure of the depth of water in the borehole the preliminary results of these experiments motivated this follow up field study to determine if 1 the vibration data obtained from community handpumps in an unconstrained real world setting can be used to track long term changes in aquifer level a conditional yes and 2 the results generalize across different depths of shallow aquifer systems yes provided a handpump maintenance infrastructure is already in place there is an opportunity to dual purpose the vibration data to monitor shallow aquifer at minimal extra cost the distributed maintenance infrastructure greeff et al 2019 allows adaptive transmission of handpump vibration data controlling when and how much of data is transmitted thus saving cost in resource constrained settings the adaptive framework blends in well with the proposed aquifer monitoring system whose predictions are only expected to be based on data from normally operational handpumps this framework is further detailed in section 2 1 1 related works and our contribution machine learning approaches have been explored to understand hydrological processes and facilitate water resource management herrera et al 2010 yaseen et al 2019 achieng 2019 these approaches have also been used to model variations in aquifer level based on hydro climatic data e g rainfall temperature nayak et al 2006 behzad et al 2010 yoon et al 2011 taormina et al 2012 tapoglou et al 2014 suryanarayana et al 2014 sahoo et al 2017 these efforts have mostly implemented standard regression approaches e g support vector regression svr bishop 2006 gaussian processes gps rasmussen 2004 multi layer perceptron regression mlp regression robert 2014 or various hybrid combinations of the same a recent work has shown long short term memory networks lstms outperformed standard mlp regression to predict water table depth by using 14 years of monthly water diversion evaporation precipitation temperature and time as input data zhang et al 2018 these efforts show the potential of using machine learning approaches to predict long term changes in aquifer level in areas where hydrogeological data are difficult or expensive to obtain the proposed work also compares lstms with mlp regression for aquifer prediction however unlike all prior work the proposed framework is novel because 1 it uses handpump vibration data to model changes in water level and 2 setting aside the specific types of models used the proposed framework combines regression and novelty detection approaches to develop a novel shallow aquifer monitoring technology that is designed to work alongside a handpump maintenance infrastructure the proposed framework can also be extended to incorporate hydro climatic data or outputs from hydrogeological models in an effort to facilitate reproducibility and data reuse the dataset greeff et al 2020 1 1 the dataset will be available at the cited address once the embargo is lifted and the software manandhar 2019 are both made publicly available 2 methods in this work we use a machine learning approach to model water column variation in a borehole based on vibration data observed at the handle of the handpump we note that there are two types of changes in the water level i the daily change in water level due to daily drawdown and recovery and ii the long term seasonal change in water level due to aquifer discharge and recharge in this work we are interested in the latter although modelling the daily cycle is in itself an interesting problem the challenge here is the unavailability of sufficient relevant vibration data because the drawdown occurs rapidly and is often associated with pump priming whose vibration characteristics were observed to be different and the recovery by definition is associated with pump disuse which does not generate any vibration data the majority of the vibration data collected during pumping corresponds to the available daily water level at the borehole which in the long term changes similarly to the daily maximum water level we exploit this long term change in the vibration data to model the long term change in water level at the borehole which we expect to approximately correspond to the variation in the corresponding shallow aquifer from which the water is being drawn out we expect the water column variation in the borehole to approximately correspond to the variation in the corresponding shallow aquifer system from which the water is being drawn out we use a regression model to learn a mapping function from vibration data to water column since we expect vibration data at each handpump to be unique an independent model is learned for each handpump to learn such a model a collection of vibration data and corresponding water column observations are required these data are collected at three different sites three handpumps per site in the study area to test if the model generalizes to different depths of shallow aquifer systems a schematic of the shallow aquifer monitoring framework is shown in fig 1 the proposed framework is designed to work alongside a handpump maintenance system represented by dashed lines and not part of the framework itself the handpump maintenance system monitors the condition of handpumps by tracking the changes in characteristics of vibration data using a novelty detection approach the outputs of this novelty detection approach known as novelty scores may be used to flag a potential pump malfunction if the future vibration data looks substantially different from the previously observed data thus facilitating rapid maintenance greeff et al 2019 the proposed technology is based on vibration data obtained from community handpumps which are regularly used and tend to break down quite frequently once every few months on average depending on the severity of malfunction and the type of subsequent repair the characteristics of vibration data may change substantially affecting the outputs of the regression model the vibration data will also change when the water in the borehole reaches previously unobserved levels when the characteristics of the vibration data changes substantially the regression model learned using previously observed vibration data may not provide correct estimation during such circumstances the novelty scores may also serve as a guideline to indicate the confidence in the regression model s outputs where higher novelty scores would correspond to lower confidence in the regression model s outputs when the vibration data has changed due to a pump malfunction and subsequent repair a simple solution to continue using the same regression model may be to calibrate the post repair vibration data back to the pre repair data we propose using a regression model to learn a map from post repair to pre repair vibration data by assuming the vibration data averaged over few days pre vs post repair are the same with respect to the water column estimation model this simple calibration technique inherently assumes the daily maximum height of water column in the borehole does not change substantially in a few days which is generally not a bad assumption based on fig 7 to avoid confusing water column related regression with calibration related regression the latter is referred to as calibration in rest of the document data from nine handpumps are collected for over a year out of which two thirds are used for learning the model i e training for novelty detection and training and validation for regression and the remaining one thirds are used for evaluating the model i e testing 2 1 study area and sample selection the study area is located in kwale county kenya south of mombasa and adjacent to northern tanzania as shown in fig 2 from western shimba hills to eastern coastal plain the area slopes towards the indian ocean the county population of 880 000 people mostly live in rural areas 82 with the majority 70 living below the poverty line of less than usd 1 25 a day knbs 2005 the study area includes the long established coastal tourism industry in diani and the more recent mining and commercial sugar production industries to sustainably manage the resulting competition for water resources reliable data on groundwater is vital a hydrogeological study of the area ferrer et al 2019 reports on the groundwater level change in the coastal coral and sand formations pleistocene magarini kalindini but not the deeper mazeras sandstone during a la nina year they find groundwater levels vary from 4 m below groundwater level bgl to 27 m bgl in response to the wetter and drier periods they also note communities depend on groundwater from boreholes with handpumps as well as open wells in the shallow aquifer in contrast the commercial use for irrigation and mining is largely in the deeper aquifer system with limited interaction with the shallow aquifer the monitoring sites selected for this study are all non commercial community handpumps readers interested in further hydrogeological or socio economic details of the study area may refer to ferrer et al 2019 katuva et al 2019 to test if the model generalizes to handpumps drawing water from different depths of shallow aquifer systems three different monitoring sites are selected corresponding to three different depth ranges shallow medium and deep where these categories are arbitrarily defined based on available samples table 1 summarizes table of columns tocs and water columns wcs at the boreholes at the time of sensor installation we also note that all boreholes were mechanically drilled the rate of daily drawdown recovery as well as long term discharge recharge are expected to differ at these three sites due to different hydrogeological socio economic and other factors besides the water columns in the boreholes in the coast are directly affected by both daily and bi weekly tidal cycles pre processing steps related to removing tidal effects are further described in section 3 1 2 2 regression approaches for water column estimation regression approaches are supervised learning techniques that map examples inputs to continuous labels outputs we use these approaches to map handpump vibration data inputs to their corresponding water column data outputs a wide variety of regression approaches exist e g relevance vector machines rvms gaussian processes gps decision forest tree regression multi layer perceptron regression mlp regression etc although experiments were performed using different types of regression approaches yielding comparable results we focus on mlp also known as feedforward neural network regression because they form a natural baseline to compare with long short term memory lstm networks the primary approach implemented in this work since we wish to provide temporal context to model water column data in terms of past examples of daily handpump vibration data lstms constitute a suitable model for our application 2 2 1 recurrent neural networks rnns feedforward networks do not have feedback i e outputs of the model are not fed back into itself when feedforward networks are extended to include feedback connections they are called recurrent neural networks rnns since feedforward networks assume samples are independent they are unable to utilize information from past samples recurrent neural networks rnns overcome this limitation by allowing information from past samples to persist by using feedback connections they do so by repeating the feedback loop structure recursively to model a sequence of samples as shown in fig 3 the recursive framework allows parameters to be shared across the repetitive structures which in turn makes parameter estimation feasible however although theoretically possible in practice rnns are unable to model long term dependence because gradients propagated over many stages tend to either vanish more common or explode rarely but causing much damage to optimization goodfellow et al 2016 2 2 2 long short term memory lstm networks to solve rnn s long term dependence problem gated rnns are the most effective solutions designed to date they do so by allowing gradients to flow for a long duration using gated self loops examples of gated rnns include long short term memory lstm networks and gated recurrent units grus goodfellow et al 2016 the former being the most widely used lstms have the same basic repetitive structure like rnns except the repeating structure called lstm cell has three gated self loops fig 4 a forget gate decides what information will be discarded from the previous cell state an input gate controls what new information will be stored in the current cell state then the outputs from the forget gate and the input gate are used to update the old cell state into a new cell state finally an output gate decides what information will be output from the new cell state the corresponding equations are 1 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f 2 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 3 c t tanh w c h t 1 x t b c 4 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 5 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o 6 h t o t tanh c t where 1 2 4 and 5 6 correspond to respectively forget input and output gates here c t is the current cell state x t is the current input vector h t is the current hidden layer vector containing the oututs of all lstm cells and b s and w s are respectively biases and weights different variations of lstms have been successfully implemented in many applications e g unconstrained handwriting recognition graves et al 2009 speech recognition graves 2013 handwriting generation graves 2013 machine translation sutskever et al 2014 image captioning kiros et al 2014 vinyals et al 2014 rnns and lstms have also been implemented to estimate aquifer using hydro climatic data zhang et al 2018 given the relatively small size of the training data we opt for a simple neural network architecture consisting of a lstm unit a drop out unit to prevent over fitting and a dense layer in sequence fig 5 as more data becomes available in future there are opportunities to implement deeper e g stacked layers and other variations e g shared layers of networks which are further discussed in section 5 the model was implemented in keras using tensorflow backend the model parameters learning rate 10 2 10 5 number of hidden nodes 50 200 epochs 10 200 batch size 10 50 and input time steps 1 14 days were coarsely optimized using separate training and validation sets with 80 20 splits a separate test set one third of data was held out for evaluating the trained model the training validation and test sets were split sequentially in time from past to future to reflect a real implementation scenario 2 3 novelty detection approaches for condition monitoring in a standard binary supervised classification approach bishop 2006 models of normality and abnormality are learned either separately or simultaneously using examples of normal and abnormal observations respectively when there are not enough examples of abnormal observations one way to classify these examples is to only learn a model of normality from normal examples and use this model to classify new examples novelty detection is a type of such one class classification approach which has been applied in many fields including electronic it security healthcare informatics industrial monitoring etc pimentel et al 2014 this approach is very applicable to condition monitoring in handpumps because usually compared to normal handpump operations there are very limited examples of abnormal handpump operations e g broken seal valve or handle malfunction etc different types of novelty detection approaches exist e g k nearest neighbour k nn kernel density estimation kde mixture models one class support vector machines one class svms pimentel et al 2014 bishop 2006 in this work we use a gaussian mixture model gmm bishop 2006 to learn a normal model by representing normal examples with a mixture of multivariate normal densities here an appropriate number of the mixture components is determined based on the data by using dirichlet process mixtures blei and jordan 2006 based on a publicly available toolbox morton and torrione 2013 for each handpump a gaussian mixture model is used to learn a normal model based on daily average frequency features generated from handpump vibration data to help parameter estimation in the mixture model instead of using all 20 frequency bins only the first three principal components are considered which represent more than 95 of total variance in data the mixture model can be used to compute log likelihood of examples the inverse of which can be considered as novelty scores i e lower the log likelihood more novel the examples since gmm provides probabilistic novelty scores it is suitable for our application where we intend to use the novelty scores as a measure of confidence of the regression model s outputs 3 data 3 1 water column data to both learn and evaluate the regression model water column in the borehole represents the ground truth the water column is measured using a diver sensor manufactured by van essen instruments that is fixed close to the bottom of the rising main fig 6 a details the nomenclatures used in this document where water column represents the ground truth for learning the regression model data is collected at a sampling interval of five minutes an example data collected over few days is shown in fig 6b where the blue line shows a typical daily cycle of draw down during the day followed by recovery during the night since our primary goal is to track the variation in the aquifer level we use the daily recovered level approximated by the daily maximum level as the ground truth for modelling water column in the boreholes in the coast is affected by both daily and bi weekly tidal cycles considering the daily maximum level removes the daily cycle blue line in fig 6c and low pass filtering the resulting data removes the bi weekly cycle orange line in fig 6c fig 7 a and c show the change in water column data in the boreholes at three monitoring sites shallow medium and deep with reference to the start date these data have been compensated with respect to the atmospheric pressure and pre processed to represent daily recovered level theoretically a network of these diver sensors would allow us to directly monitor the shallow aquifer without having to do any modelling however given the intended scale of the proposed technology country to sub continent such monitoring program would be cost prohibitively impractical here the costs not only refer to the cost of the sensor but also the ones involved in installing the sensor and downloading the data periodically both extremely laborious process 3 2 handpump vibration data the vibration data is collected using a consumer grade accelerometer sensor attached to the handle of the handpump as shown in fig 8 a the sensor measures accelerometer data in three orthogonal axes at a sampling frequency of 95 hz a typical pumping cycle i e a cycle of the handle being raised and pushed down corresponds to one second interval an example data collected over few pumping cycles is shown in fig 8b in machine learning approaches raw data are often first summarized by useful information known as features before using them to learn a model the low frequency component of the data which corresponds to the pumping motion is found to be uninformative of water column variation the pumping motion is removed using a high pass filter and the resulting high pass filtered time series signal top plot in fig 8c is transformed to frequency domain using a morelet transform the magntiude of the morelet transfrom bottom plot in fig 8c averaged across the time window represents the frequency features corresponding to that window a daily average of these temporal windows along with the corresponding daily maximum water column represent a feature label pair a collection of these feature label pairs per handpump constitutes a training and testing dataset for that handpump vibration data maybe unavailable for a period of time due to several reasons most commonly due to battery or sensor malfunction or handpump disuse a handpump may be temporarily out of operation usually because of malfunction or alternate water sources e g surface water being available during rainy season or school closures in case of handpumps installed at the schools we propose using gaussian processes rasmussen 2004 to impute frequency features corresponding to missing days unfortunately for two handpumps one shallow and one deep too much data were missing to allow reasonable data imputation hence we only report results on the seven remaining handpumps since the highest proportion of data is available for the medium depth handpumps we provide detailed results for that site while only providing key results for the other two sites 4 results the machine learning approaches described in section 2 are used to perform several experiments related to water column estimation using the dataset described in section 3 at this stage our primary goal is to assess the feasibility of the proposed technology in a real world setting i e whether vibration data from a collection of community handpumps at a location can be used to infer the trend in water column variation of the corresponding aquifer 4 1 novelty detection analysis figs 9 11 show the novelty scores of training blue dots and test red dots examples in terms of log likelihood of examples given the normal model in general the examples in future incrementally appear to be more different from the normal examples this trend is expected because the vibration data is expected to change over time either due to gradual pump wear and or change in water level in the borehole to previously unobserved levels a relatively smooth change or due to severe pump malfunction and subsequent repair a relatively abrupt change a continuous drop in the log likelihood suggesting a gradual change in vibration data may correspond to change in water column over time e g fig 10c on the other hand an abrupt change in vibration data due to severe pump malfunction repair often corresponds to a sharp drop in the log likelihood most of these cases e g fig 10a and b etc stand out visually and are aligned to their corresponding pump repair dates black dashed lines whenever the repair dates are available these insights from novelty detection analysis help understand the results of experiments related to calibration and water column estimation 4 2 vibration data calibration usually the novelty scores appear to be higher i e the log likelihood values are lower immediately following a repair e g fig 9b indicating a substantial change in the vibration data after the repair to enable using a single regression model to estimate water column the post repair vibration data is calibrated to match the pre repair data an example of this calibration process is detailed in fig 9 where the top row shows the features generated from the vibration data fig 9a the log likelihoods fig 9b and the water column estimates fig 9c and the bottom row shows the corresponding plots after calibration since a very simple regression model was used to calibrate the vibration data its quality is expected to degrade as further calibrations are performed in future in the example the second calibration does not work as well as the first calibration as part of our future work we intend to explore more principled ways to model this problem e g transfer learning which is discussed in section 5 4 3 water column estimation analysis for medium depth handpumps results are shown for lstm and for reference compared to mlp regression in fig 10 for shallow and deep handpumps results are only shown for lstm in fig 11 in both figures each column corresponds to results for a particular handpump where the rows correspond to the novelty scores novelty scores post calibration lstm estimates and mlp estimates only in fig 10 from top to bottom the estimates for training validation and test sets are shown in blue orange and red colours respectively the estimates are shown in terms of their 95 confidence interval based on 10 iterations of training lstm model with random initialization while parameters for each approach were coarsely optimized using cross validation we have not performed exhaustive parameter optimization because our primary goal at this stage is to assess whether the estimates roughly tracks the true changes in water column rather than obtain the best possible outputs a summary of results for all handpumps for both mlp and lstm techniques are provided in table 2 results show that in general vibration data are indicative of changes in the water column lstm generally outperforms standard mlp regression technique where lstm is expected to perform even better as more training data become available in most cases pump repairs change the vibration data features substantially which when corrected via calibration does somewhat help to improve water column estimation but the frequency and or the nature of repairs may determine the efficacy of the simple calibration technique implemented in this work nevertheless the novelty detection outputs provide a reasonably accurate guideline to determine when to trust the regression model outputs typically a drop in the log likelihood corresponds to either an inaccurate water column estimate or one with high uncertainty the proposed technology is intended to be implemented at scale by concurrently modeling a network of community handpumps rather than estimating continuous changes in water column at individual boreholes our ultimate goal is to use a network of handpumps to infer the overall trend in the water levels in the corresponding shallow aquifer with this goal in mind we plot the fractional change in water columns at the boreholes at two locations with respect to a common reference date fig 12 a and b show these plots for medium and shallow handpumps respectively these results show the estimated changes in water column approximately track the true trend however the estimates deteriorate as we start predicting further ahead in time due to the limitations in the model which are discussed in section 4 4 similar plots are not shown for deep handpumps because the difference in their water column data variation suggests that there may be differences in the hydrogeological dynamics of the aquifers from which the two deep handpumps are drawing water 4 4 limitations despite the resources invested in collecting a unique handpump vibration dataset using novel sensing technology in terms of hydrogeology one year of data is insufficient to track long term changes in aquifer level few years of data may be required to capture a typical range of aquifer level changes in the current dataset validation and test data are often very different from training data complicating both training and testing the model approximately 15 of data were missing usually over continuous streams of time from days to months primarily due to discharged batteries or other hardware related problems handpump malfunction or temporary handpump disuse because of availability of alternate water sources during rainy season e g rain harvesting surface water despite using gaussian processes to impute the missing data the accuracy of the imputed data degrades as the duration of missing data increases the effectiveness of the vibration data calibration technique depends on the frequency and type of handpump repair with the calibration being less effective as the number and or severity of breakdowns repairs increase although the novelty scores provide a guideline to assess the confidence of the water column estimates better techniques are required to model this problem in a principled manner e g transfer learning 5 conclusions the proposed technology based on handpump vibration data and machine learning approaches show promise in providing useful aquifer monitoring information in resource constrained regions where alternate sources of data are either scarce or cost prohibitive and where handpumps already constitute part of the rural water infrastructure in regions where handpump maintenance infrastructure is already in place there is an opportunity to use the vibration data for the additional purpose of providing rudimentary shallow aquifer monitoring at minimal extra cost as expected going from constrained to unconstrained real world environment brings challenges the most pressing one concerns frequent handpump breakdown and subsequent repair that complicates learning a consistent model to estimate changes in water level beside the solutions implemented in this work in the form of novelty scores and vibration data calibration we intend to explore more principled methods in future to model this problem given a pre trained model transfer learning zoph et al 2016 yang et al 2017 allows learning a variation of the learned model for a dataset with different characteristics by only requiring a relatively smaller dataset further field experiments will be required to determine if transfer learning is feasible and how much new data hours days will be required to re train the model we note that in practice the proposed technology is designed to be implemented at scale using a network of handpumps as long as a sufficiently large number of these handpumps at a location are operational the framework may allow useful approximate inference about the underlying aquifer behaviour within a degree of uncertainty further large scale field experiments are required to ascertain the viability of this technology for real world application as well as to determine under which conditions this technology is likely to fail and succeed we note that the proposed technology is aimed to complement cost effectively any traditional hydrogeological models rather than replace them as part of our future work there are opportunities to model multiple handpumps simultaneously and fuse hydro climatic data and wherever available outputs from hydrogeological models multi task learning extensions of lstm liu et al 2016 chen et al 2018 are well suited to model such scenarios given the increasing global importance of groundwater monitoring technology there needs to be more research to fill the gap between available state of the art but cost prohibitive technologies and the capacity of developing nations to adopt them novel cost effective technologies that utilize the available infrastructure of these regions may be a plausible path moving forward given the success and ongoing trials of machine learning approaches to solve global socio developmental challenges beckel et al 2013 blumenstock et al 2015 jean et al 2016 rolnick et al 2019 experimentation of these approaches may provide cost effective complementary options to boost on going progress in hydrogeological modeling to monitor

8587,a more objective assessment of the freshwater scarcity risk at a watershed basis scale contributes to the achievement of the sustainable development goals sdgs in which water plays a key role in issues like safe and affordable drinking water water related disasters forest management biodiversity and ecosystems within the sdgs water scarcity is assessed primarily by using the ratio of withdrawal to availability wta this index has been developed to evaluate the average annual conditions on a broad scale such as country or large basin however there are insufficient cases for assessing specific and detailed risk conditions by using this original wta concept due to seasonal and interannual variations of the river discharge and withdrawal volumes for example infrastructure e g large dams and its operation can drastically change the available water and demand volumes at temporal scales finer than annual because recently many daily and monthly records of river discharge and water use have become publicly available it is possible to conduct water scarcity risk assessments on a monthly basis by employing these datasets in this study we propose to compare volumes of available water and demand by using a sectoral and statistical demand to availability ss dta index the novelty of this index is marked not only by the use of monthly volumes of available and required water but also by how environmental water requirements are included and the statistical relevance of the evaluation usually to determine the available water resources existing methods deduct from the river discharge the volumes that are required to preserve the surrounding ecosystems our proposed method considers the environmental flow requirements as one of the water demand sectors allowing a simultaneous evaluation of water use that is not possible with existing methods we applied this method to three representative river basins two located in japan the tone and the arakawa river basins and the brantas river basin in indonesia the results showed the variations of water scarcity risk level through the river operation in each river basin in the tone river basin it was succeeded in a drought year to decrease its risk level from 1 to 0 and to transport sufficient volume of water to the arakawa river basin through an artificial channel to meet the demands at the same time in the brantas river basin the river operation changed the ss dta score from 3 to 2 which means the water scarcity risk level was alleviated while the main impact of the operation was found in high water season to decrease the flood risk because the number type and priority of water demands can be adjusted based on the local situation and all the timeseries data of each demand sector are visualized in parallel the result includes not only the whole risk level of the river basin but also the practical and specific degree of the risk with demand sector information abbreviations bws baseline water

and the surrounding environment examples can be found in goal 6 access to safe and affordable drinking water sustainable development knowledge platform 2019 goal 9 resilient infrastructure goal 11 water related disasters and goal 15 forest management biodiversity and ecosystems the vital role of water has motivated all around the world the scientific development of objective methods to assess its condition the japanese government enacted the water cycle basic act in 2014 which defines the basic philosophy and measures related to the water cycle in an integrated and comprehensive manner ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism japan 2008 2018 taniguchi 2015 it has become clear that to achieve a sound water cycle it is necessary to identify the situation of each watershed and to encourage efforts related to water resources management and conservation water unlike other natural resources like oil circulates and can be unevenly distributed in time and space throughout its cycle brutsaert 2005 oki and kanae 2006 postel et al 1996 because of this natural trait potential risks like water scarcity need to be evaluated based on the availability of water at different stages of the hydrological cycle to this end although quite similar several indices that measure water scarcity risk can be found in related literature commonly these indices are based on the ratio of withdrawal to availability wta one of the earliest studies to mention such a measure referred to it as the withdrawal to water resources index raskin et al 1997 the wta ratio was employed later in the works by reig et al 2013 and gassert et al 2015 which defined the baseline water stress index bws another example is the water stress index wsi that was developed based on the wta ratio introducing the seasonal variation of precipitation pfister et al 2009 2011 a different approach was proposed by boulay et al 2018 in which instead of focusing on the actual withdrawal the proposed demand to available water resources dta index evaluated the water volume needed to cope with a specific demand following on previous studies hoekstra et al 2012 introduced the ratio of consumptive water use to water availability evaluated at the monthly scale even though the abovementioned methods are useful in making annual broad i e large scale such as that of a country assessments of the water cycle condition and the potential scarcity risk they have shown limitations when applied at finer spatial and temporal scales on the one hand annual evaluations indicating that a watershed is not currently under water stress may fail to identify a water stress situation at the monthly scale and thus obviate a severe risk on the other hand annual evaluations indicating that a watershed is on the verge or passed the limit of water stress may come out from a river with strongly regulated flows these regulations like dam operations are aimed at covering seasonal demands and hence the watershed is misleadingly characterized as being at high risk to overcome these limitations hanasaki et al 2008a 2008b 2013 introduced the cumulative withdrawal to water demand ratio also known as the cumulative abstraction to demand cad ratio which shows the sufficiency level of the water supply to the water demand in other words this index can address whether there is enough water to withdraw while the cad ratio was evaluated annually in those studies the water supply and demand corresponded to estimations of daily values the above methods share a fundamental concept the scarcity risk is evaluated by comparing the volumes of water use and natural water resources where water use volume is defined in terms of either withdrawal consumption or demand as a side note for simplification the target 6 4 2 of the sdg defined the withdrawal as a proportion of the available freshwater resources to indicate the level of water stress united nations statistics division 2018 even though measurements of water withdrawal and more abundant water demand can be more suitable locations where water is scarce and at the same time there is a high demand of water water use may not only affect human health well being or economic activities but also aquatic ecosystems on this regard vanham et al 2018 noted that environmental flows need to be included in water stress assessments the impact assessment of water consumption based on available water resources aware boulay et al 2018 evaluated water scarcity by subtracting the environmental water requirements ewr from the available water resources and employing a monthly scale approach that considers five major habitat types including main freshwater ecoregions pastor et al 2014 because environmental water requirements are sensitive to changes on regional climate regulations and awareness global or large scale assessments of water scarcity need to include these circumstances to reflect the local efforts aimed at reducing risks because of seasonal variations the natural water supply is not constant throughout the year consequently the actual available volume of water resources during certain seasons can be much less than the average annual volume the aqueduct 2 0 reig et al 2013 water resources assessment framework incorporates indices to evaluate seasonal and interannual variations in water resources but these indices are independent of the computation of the bws and therefore may not precisely represent water stress or risk later aqueduct 3 0 hofste et al 2019 included the monthly variations of withdrawal of available water to overcome the temporal misrepresentation of the bws index of the previous version in another study hanasaki et al 2008a 2008b compared globally several indices that evaluate the water resources and found out that based on indices that are a function of the annual volumes there are areas with an underestimated water risk level this finding proved that the actual water risk cannot be assessed with the annual volume of water resources and that data at temporally finer resolutions are required to assess the sufficiency level of water supply to water demand fortunately there are many available observed data regarding local water resources and use on a daily or monthly basis considering that monthly and daily records related to water resources have been increasing worldwide we consider that the improvement of accuracy of water risk assessments is possible although the existing evaluation indices particulaly wta and dta are sufficient to grasp the annual conditions temporal fine resolution data can improve our understanding of water scarcity risk one of the principal reasons is that even if annual precipitation does not vary the daily and monthly volumes of water resources can be altered with infrastructure and water management e g dam operation another example of alterations of the natural water flow is the long range transportation of water employing the water footprint assessment framework yano et al 2018 noted that the inter basin transfer changed the evaluation of water risk for both water sending and water receiving watersheds another factor that affects the water resources assessments and is still subject of discussion is the volumes of withdrawn water that were not consumed and returned to the watershed for example although the withdrawn water volumes for irrigation of paddy fields are considerable a large non consumed portion returns to the original watershed either by natural flow and infiltration drainage water from industrial use is also released to the surface waters after treatment if these volumes of returned or released water is not included in the available water resource the assessment indices may overestimate the water scarcity risk the review made above of the existing water scarcity risk assessment methods and limitations shows that improvements can still be made to accurately represent the actual situation of water resources in the watersheds these improvements can be made seasonal interannual variability of natural water resources the artificial variation of water resources the impact of non consumed that returns to the watershed and the environmental water requirements in this study we developed a new index for assessing the water scarcity risk by improving the dta index so that it includes the seasonal and interannual variations the demand volumes differentiated by sector i e industrial domestic agricultural and the environmental flow requirements in this manner this new sectoral and statistical demand to availability ss dta index is aimed at better representing the actual water resources state in terms of water supply and demand at a temporal resolution finer than that of the dta index the ss dta index was calculated to assess three watersheds in asia using local data we believe that a much more objective assessment like the one that can be achieved with the proposed index may provide more detailed information about available water in the watershed scarcity risk and the positive impact of water resources management more comprehensive representations of the actual water resources state and the sustainability of the current planned freshwater use may become an incentive for nations local governments non governmental organizations ngos and companies to implement or improve their water conservation and management policies 2 material and methods 2 1 study area in this study the tone and arakawa rivers in japan and the brantas river in indonesia were chosen as the study areas fig 1 shows the location and land use of each river basin the two japanese rivers are located in the kanto region and are the main freshwater source in the capital region ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism japan 2008 this region has vast records and detailed information about dam operation in the upstream the withdrawal volumes and the transferred volumes that are possible through the musashi suiro channel this cannel connects the tone river and the arakawa river and was built to conduct water to the arakawa river and meet the demand volumes around the tokyo metropolitan area japan water agency 2019 using global estimates of water supply and demand gassert et al 2015 calculated the bws index which has a five category grading system of risk i e low less than 0 1 low to medium 0 1 to 0 2 medium to high 0 2 to 0 4 high 0 4 to 0 8 and extremely high greater than 0 8 the tone river basin was characterized as being in medium to high risk bws 0 356 while the risk of the arakawa river basin was deemed high bws 0 529 based on the global estimates on the other hand using the available local data yano et al 2018 included the effect of the inter basin water transfer in the computation of the bws index because the volume of the transported water transported corresponded to 45 of the naturally available the computed bws of the arakawa river decreased from 0 387 to 0 268 corresponding to a medium to high value due to water transportation the brantas river is the longest river in east java surabaja the second largest city in indonesia is located in its delta in the river there are large dams such as sutami lodoyo and wlingi fujimoto 2013 after spiralling the brantas river flows into the bali sea however large volumes are diverted through the nejama tunnel into the indian ocean even though the diverted volumes are used for hydraulic power generation it also prevents downstream floods river discharge and dam operation records were measured by jasa tirta i public corporation pjt 1 in the aqueduct 2 0 assessment framework using global data the bws index characterized the brantas river basin as being in extremely high risk gassert et al 2015 2 2 data collection the evaluations that we made in this study were for natural conditions and operated conditions natural conditions correspond to discharges if there were no flow regulating infrastructure whereas operated conditions correspond to water resources with some kind of man made alterations such as dam operation or transfer since the three target river basins have flow regulating infrastructure the observed river discharge corresponds to operated conditions the natural conditions were then inferred using the dam operation and water transfer records we chose the kurihashi station records of observed daily discharge as available water resources of the tone river basin which is the location where water is transferred to the arakawa river basin the river discharge is affected by the operation of the following upstream dams yagisawa naramata fujiwara aimata sonohara shimokubo kusaki and watarase thus the inlet and outlet flows as well as the water transportation to the arakawa river basin were necessary in our study the flow in natural conditions of the tone river was calculated by adding the water transportation volume to the discharge observed at the kurihashi station and the flow in operated conditions was calculated by adding the outflows of the dam operation to the natural flow we also obtained the demand and actual withdrawal data for municipal agricultural and industrial water use in the tone river basin this data details of which are described in yano et al 2018 correspond to daily records from 1989 to 2014 and accumulated into monthly values since we considered available water and demand in the tone river basin at the kurihashi station the results are representive of the entire watershed but only of the middle and upper regions we chose the records of observed daily discharge at the river mouth of the arakawa river as available water resources the inlet and outlet flows of the futase takizawa urayama kakkau and arima dams and the arakawa reservoir were required in this study the volumes of water demand and withdrawal were obtained in the same way as explained above for the tone river basin for the brantas river pjt 1 facilitated monthly data of water demand for each sector river discharge dam operation and water transportation from 2003 to 2012 the demand for agricultural water use corresponds to the irrigation volumes at mrican kanan mrican kiri jati melerek menturus and delta brantas the demand for municipal water use was defined as the water used for baths kitchens and restrooms in residential areas and the industrial water use corresponds to that of industrial facilities private factories and non domestic water use i e commercial water use in shopping malls and public areas such as schools and government offices flows of naatural and operated conditions of the brantas river represent the discharge at new lengkong the natural flow was calculated by subtracting the water volumes changes by infrastructure i e dam operation and transportation and adding the water volumes that were used for irrigation but were not returned the course flowing by new lengkong the operated flow was calculated by adding the irrigated and not returned flow to the observed discharge which means that the observed discharge reflects the effect of infrastructure such as dam operation and transportation 2 3 methods 2 3 1 environmental flow requirements efr the maintenance flow rates reserved for conservation of flora and fauna i e 59 0 m3 s 1 for the tone river basin and 5 0 m3 s 1 for the arakawa river basin were used as efr respectively these values are defined as constant throughout the year however because temporal variation is important for ecosystems we made the exercise of comparing the maintenance flow rates with the efr proposed in two previous studies pastor et al 2014 shirakawa 2005 which are based on the monthly average river discharge fig 2 shows the calculated values of efr for each river basin where efr p refers to the ones calculated using the method proposed by pastor et al 2014 efr s refers to ones using the method of shirakawa 2005 and efr l refers to the local maintenance flow rates additionally we defined efr pd5 as the efr that would be obtained with the method of pastor et al 2014 but using only the monthly discharges in the year that approximates the 20th percentile in terms of annual volumes for the tone and arakawa river basins the efr pd5 was calculated using data of the 20 year period from 1991 to 2010 the choice of the optimal efr computation method depends on how well the values approximate the maintenance flow rates efr l during the dry season which lasts from january to march for the tone river basin fig 2a the efr p curve roughly satisfies the maintenance flow rates during the dry season unlike the other two methods for the arakawa river basin fig 2b efr pd5 does not only satisfy the maintenance flow rates during the dry season but also keeps reasonable levels above the efr l curve throughout the year for the brantas river basin the japan international cooperation agency jica 1998 established a maintenance flow rates equal to 32 1 m3 s 1 at new lengkong this value referred to as efr l corresponded to the 5th percentile of the observed river discharge in that study in fig 2c during the dry season which lasts from july to october the efr pd5 curve depicts values larger than those of the efr s curve but smaller than those of the efr p curve more importantly the efr pd5 curve satisfies the maintenance flow rates efr l during this period the efr of each river basin was calculated based on the river discharge at the locations detailed in the previous section kurihashi station in the tone river basin the mouth of the arakawa river and new lengkong in the brantas river basin 2 3 2 consumption rate the demand of water was calculated from the record of water withdrawal and consumption rate of each sector in this study consumption rate consists of consumption through evapotranspiration cet and consumption through non return flow crf where cet is the ratio of water consumed after withdrawal including evaporation transpiration and export volumes from the watershed and crf is the ratio of water that is released into a different watershed from the perspective of a downstream water user the crf rate is assumed to be a consumption from the original basin the consumption rate in each river basin was set as follows table 1 shows the consumption rates of each water demand sector in the tone river basin in which 0 35 was adopted as cet for agricultural water this value is the same as the one adopted by hanasaki et al 2013 and döll and siebert 2002 as an irrigation efficiency in japan since all the returned volumes flow to the same basin crf is set equal to zero the cet for industrial and municipal water were set equal to 0 15 and 0 10 respectively these values are the same as the ones shiklomanov 2000 and hanasaki et al 2008a 2013 adopted for evaporated portion of the total withdrawal based on the water network of the tone river basin we determined that around 10 of withdrawn water above the kurihashi station is discharged into the river below kurihashi as sewerage hence the crf rate is set equal to 0 10 for the arakawa river basin the consumption rate cet for agricultural industrial and municipal use were determined in the same way as for the tone river basin since all the returned water is discharged back to the same watershed crf was set equal to 0 as shown in table 2 based on jica 1998 which includes data related to local irrigation conditions in the brantas river basin we set cet equal to 0 70 the same report also mentioned that the returned volumes flow directly from the brantas delta to the sea hence we set the crf rate equal to 0 30 for the brantas delta we set the cet rate for industrial and municipal water equal to those defined and used in shiklomanov 2000 and hanasaki et al 2008a 2013 because the exact location of the discharge is unknown and because we wanted to assume a maximum impact of the demand volumes the total consumption rates were set equal to 1 0 as shown in table 3 2 3 3 withdrawal to availability wta withdrawal to availability which is similar in definition to the bws is calculated as follows 1 wta c w w r w r e f r 2 rwr q obs w w where rwr is the renewable water resource expressed as the monthly discharge of each river m3 s 1 ww is the monthly water withdrawal m3 s 1 efr is the environmental flow requirement based on efr p for the tone river basin and efr pd5 for the arakawa and the brantas river basins m3 s 1 c is the demand sector i e municipal industrial and agricultural use and qobs is the observed discharge of each river basin because qobs corresponds to the remaining water resource after subtracting the upstream withdrawal volumes rwr calculated as the total volume of ww and qobs when efr is larger than rwr the denominator in equation 1 is set equal to 1 0 the values of wta and rwr are calculated for natural and operated conditions the operated conditions include the effect of dam operation and the transfer of water to the arakawa river basin therefore in natural or operated conditions wta is referred to as natural or operated wta it is worth mentioning that the bws index does not explicitly take into account efr although they were implicitly considered at the time of defining the categorization grading system hofste et al 2019 in this study the efr are considered as one of the water demand volumes at the time of computing the wta ratio 2 3 4 demand to availability dta demand to availability focuses not on the actual withdrawal of water but on the volume of water needed locally the dta in this study is calculated as follows 3 dta c w d r w r e f r 4 wd w w k cons where wd is the water demand of each category c kcons is defined as shown in tables 1 2 and 3 when efr is larger than rwr the denominator in equation 1 is set equal to 1 0 like the computation of wta dta is computed for natural and operated conditions therefore in natural or operated conditions dta is referred to as natural or operated dta the dta was proposed by boulay et al 2014 referring intensity of the water demand in comparison with availability in a region the availability and human demand were calculated on a monthly time step in boulay et al 2018 2 3 5 a modified abstraction to demand ratio the cad index as presented in hanasaki et al 2013 is the ratio of annually accumulated withdrawal and demand volumes which was computed using modelled quantities of withdrawal because getting actual volumes of withdrawal depends on broad statistics and may not always be accurately estimated in this study we tried the proxy ww min wd rwr using the available monthly data of wd and rwr it is easy to see that the withdrawal volumes ww cannot be larger than those required wd nor those available rwr accordingly let us define a modified ratio of hanasaki s cad index cadm as shown in eq 5 5 cad m m i n r w r c w d c w d when rwr is larger than the total water demand i e the demand volumes were fully met by the river discharge cadm is at most equal to 1 0 like the previous indices in natural or operated conditions cadm is referred to as natural or operated cadm 2 3 6 sectoral and statistical dta ss dta in this study we propose to modify the dta ratio which represents the sufficiency level of available water resources to demand volumes to better represent the local management of the available water resources this improvement was achieved by including monthly variations of available and demand water volumes by changing the grading system which takes only integer values that range from zero to the number of demand sectors and by evaluating the scarcity risk on a probabilistically representative year the proposed index is defined as follows description ss dta score 6 c 1 c max mwd d y 20 mrwr d y 20 0 c 1 i mwd d y 20 mrwr d y 20 c 1 i 1 mwd d y 20 i 1 c max c max i mrwr d y 20 c 1 1 mwd d y 20 i and c take only integer values c max where mwd refers to monthly values of wd mrwr refers to monthly values of rwr the subscript dy20 refers to the year that approximates the 20th percentile of the annual discharges and c refers to the demand sectors i e municipal industrial agricultural and environmental note that within the demand sectors we included the efr in this manner it can be determined whether the available water resources not only meet the demand volumes related to human activities but also those of the aquatic ecosystems and other environmental requirements if ss dta is equal to zero it means that no demand sector is at risk larger values are equal to the number of demand sectors that are at risk during the dry season the fact that the proposed index takes only integer values makes it more intelligible and comparable with past conditions post policy change future conditions operated conditions and even with the indices of neighbouring watersheds the comparative expressions in equation 6 require that we assign a level of priority to each demand sector according to the japanese law regarding the use of water bodies the management and operation of flow regulating infrastructure during dry periods does not specify a particular order of priority instead the water users are advised to manage the water resources in a spirit of mutual trust and cooperation the authors have agreed that for research purposes in this study we assign more priority to municipal domestic demand volumes followed by industrial agricultural and flow maintenance demand volumes naturally the order of priority depends on local policies and awareness but this flexible trait can be important at the country administration level for comparing regional efforts towards more sustainable use of water resources as mentioned before the scarcity risk is intended to be evaluated on a statistically representative year i e the year that approximates the 20th percentile of the annual river discharge records the choice of percentile was based on an analysis of the local management plans of each watershed for example the water resources development plan of the tone arakawa river system was designed considering droughts with non exceedance probability of 10 jica 2004 in the brantas river basin the water resources development plan specified designs of irrigation structures considering the lowest flow in the 20 years of records but recommended the verification of these using droughts with non exceedance probability of 10 jica 1998 in this study to be on the safe side we employed the data of the year that approximates the 20th percentile of the annual discharge which could be assumed to be an estimator of the non exceedance probability of 20 the percentile can be set based not only on water resource management plans but also local stakeholder agreements or infrastructure design norms like the existing indices henceforth in natural or operated conditions ss dta is referred to as natural or operated ss dta 3 results 3 1 water risk of the tone river basin evaluated using existing indices as a reminder according to the definition of the existing indices employed in this study for the wta and dta indices values larger than 1 00 imply that the water resources are at risk contrarily a cadm index can take values in the range 0 00 to 1 00 and any value different than 1 0 implies some level of scarcity risk i e the available water resources do not meet the demands fig 3 shows the computed values using the existing indices i e wta dta and cadm from 1989 to 2010 22 years for the tone river basin the timeseries figure is shown in fig s1 this river basin tends to have larger wta and dta during winter december to february and summer june to august the computed values of natural wta were greater than 1 00 i e denoting risk in 58 out of the 264 months 22 12 whereas the one of operated wta denoted risk in 52 out of the 264 months fig 3a this result means that the dam operation has a positive impact by reducing water scarcity risk for example in june 1990 the computed value of natural wta equal to 117 decreased to a value of operated wta equal to 3 45 other similar examples in the same timeseries are from 119 to 2 95 in june 1994 from 123 to 6 35 in august 1995 and from 119 to 3 55 in august 2004 in the previous examples even though the values of operated wta were much smaller they were still greater than 1 00 these outcomes are a consequence of the dam operation increasing the flow discharge but not meeting the total demand volumes including efr however for several months the computation of operated wta yielded larger values than the ones of natural wta examples are april 1993 natural wta 0 36 and operated wta 1 17 april 1996 natural wta 0 51 and operated wta 1 18 november 1996 natural wta 0 65 and operated wta 1 31 these results were obtained because the flow discharge in operated conditions was calculated considering the increase caused by the dam operation and the decrease caused by the water transfer to the arakawa river basin and thus it can be smaller than the discharge in natural conditions regarding the dta index the number of months denoting risk was less than that obtained for wta where natural and operated dta were greater than 1 0 in 32 and 22 out of the 264 months fig 3b respectively while wta is calculated based on water withdrawal dta is based on water demand the actual demand volumes of water consumption tend to be smaller than those of withdrawal especially in the agricultural sector a large portion of the withdrawn water that was not consumed 65 in the case of the tone river basin is released back to the original watershed in fig 3c because cadm does not consider efr the results showed less occurrence of risk than those of wta and dta while natural cadm yielded one month with a value smaller than 1 0 the operated cadm did not generate values other than 1 0 during the whole 22 years period excluding efr this result shows that the dam operation can sufficiently meet the water demands of municipal industrial and agricultural sectors in natural conditions the 264 month average values of wta dta and cadm were equal to 6 80 2 93 and 1 00 respectively whereas in operated conditions these indices changed to 2 43 1 04 and 1 00 respectively the median values in natural conditions were equal to 0 39 0 20 and 1 00 respectively whereas in operated conditions these indices changed to 0 39 0 19 and 1 00 respectively 3 2 water risk of the arakawa river basin evaluated using existing indices fig 4 shows the computed values using the existing indices for the arakawa river basin the timeseries figure is shown in fig s2 the observations made about the different results that were obtained by using the data in natural and operated conditions are quite similar to those of the tone river basin the indices obtained in operated conditions tend to be smaller than those in natural conditions however the degree to which operated conditions mitigated the periods that were at risk in natural conditions is much more noticeable than what was observed for the tone river basin while wta indices in natural conditions yielded 120 out of 264 months denoting risk in operated conditions only one out of 264 months denoted risk the operated wta of february 1996 was equal to 1 01 fig 4a similarly the 10 months out of the 264 that yielded values of natural dta above 1 0 i e denoting risk yielded operated dta indices smaller than 1 0 fig 4b this positive outcome was caused by water transportation from the tone river basin through the musashi suiro channel and agrees with the findings of yano et al 2018 where it was pointed out that the water transfer decreased the scarcity risk characterization of this watershed from high bws 0 387 to medium to high bws 0 268 regarding the cadm index fig 4c both natural and operated conditions did not yield values other than 1 00 implying that all the demand volumes in the arakawa river basin were met sufficiently in natural conditions the 264 month average values of wta dta and cadm were equal to 1 79 0 34 and 1 00 respectively whereas in operated conditions these indices changed to 0 42 0 08 and 1 00 respectively the median values in natural conditions were equal to 0 87 0 18 and 1 00 respectively whereas in operated conditions these indices changed to 0 40 0 08 and 1 00 respectively 3 3 water risk of the brantas river basin evaluated using existing indices fig 5 shows the computed values using the existing indicators for the brantas river basin the timeseries figure is shown in fig s3 because the evaluation period 10 years from 2003 to 2012 was different from that of the tone and arakawa river basins 22 years from 1989 to 2010 we analyse the outcomes separately curiously opposite to what was observed in the results of the other two basins where in operated conditions the months denoting risk were less than those in natural conditions for the brantas river basin the values of operated wta and dta showed more months denoting risk than those in natural conditions the values of natural and operated wta showed that 48 and 53 out of 120 months respectively denoted risk i e were greater than 1 0 likewise the values of natural and operated dta showed that 49 and 55 out of 120 months respectively denoted risk despite the outcome described above the average values of natural wta and dta were smaller than those in operated conditions this result means that the degree of scarcity risk was alleviated by the water resource management such as large dam operations the results showed no month in which the natural or operated rwr were smaller than the efr consequently the largest values of natural wta and dta were 5 81 and 6 43 respectively the results of the cadm index were similar to those of the wta and dta index the number of months denoting risk i e yielding a cadm index smaller than 1 0 were 34 and 40 for natural and operated conditions respectively the most critical value of the cadm index in natural conditions was 0 55 which due to dam operation was alleviated to a value of operated cadm equal to 0 68 in natural conditions the 120 month average values of wta dta and cadm were equal to 1 24 1 28 and 0 93 respectively whereas in operated conditions these indices changed to 1 23 1 27 and 0 94 respectively the median values in natural conditions were equal to 0 67 0 71 and 1 00 respectively whereas in operated conditions these indices changed to 0 85 0 88 and 1 00 respectively 3 4 ss dta of each river basin fig 6 shows the computed ss dta on a monthly basis for each of the three river basins the water demands of each sector including efr is separately illustrated to let us assess which ones are not sufficiently met by the volumes of natural rwr and how the outcome changes in operated conditions as mentioned previously the demand sector to which we assigned the highest priority is the municipal followed by the industrial the agricultural and the environmental in that order the timeseries figure is shown in fig s4 for the tine river basin fig 6a the monthly river discharge rwr was larger than the sum of the demand volumes of the four sectors in 232 out of the 264 months in operated conditions the number of months in which the operated ss dta was equal to 0 increased to 242 for 31 out of 264 months the efr could not be met in natural conditions but due to flow regulations operated conditions the same situation was observed only for 22 out of 264 months also for 1 out of 264 months the efr and agricultural demand volumes could not be met in natural conditions but due to flow regulations only efr could not be met in that month during the droughts of the whole 22 year period industrial and municipal demand volumes were not potentially at risk neither in natural nor operated conditions for the arakawa river basin fig 6b for 11 out of the 264 months the efr could not be met in natural conditions but due to flow regulations operated conditions the accumulated demand volumes of the four sectors were met during the whole period this result means that drought could have had a potential impact on the efr if proper flow regulations like water transfer and dam operation had not been undertaken for the brantas river basin fig 6c in natural conditions efr were potentially at risk for 15 out of 120 months efr and agricultural demand volumes were potentially at risk for 32 out of 120 months and efr agricultural and industrial demand volumes were potentially at risk for 2 out of 120 months due to flow regulations operated conditions the previous number of months changed to 15 40 and 0 respectively interestingly for operated conditions although the number of months in which efr agricultural and industrial demand volumes could have been potentially at risk decreased to zero the number of months in which efr and agricultural demand volumes could have been at risk increased the values of ss dta index that were obtained for each river basin are shown in fig 7 the year for which the annual discharge approximated the 20th percentile of the records is 1999 for the tone and the arakawa river basins and 2004 for the brantas river basin the natural ss dta of the tone river basin was equal to 1 because the efr could not be satisfied by the natural discharge in february and june the operated ss dta was equal to 0 because of an increase of the river discharge for these month as a result of the flow regulations fig 7a for the arakawa river basin fig 7b the natural ss dta was equal to 1 in which was the environmental sector could not be satisfied by the natural discharge in february however due to the flow regulations the operated ss dta was equal to 0 as a result of an increase in the february river discharge the natural ss dta of the brantas river basin was equal to 3 in which the environmental agricultural and industrial demand sectors could be potentially affected by the low flow in october the value of operated ss dta was equal to 2 which means that the flow regulations signified and increase in the october flow discharge enough to satisfy the accumulated demand volumes of the municipal and industrial sectors but not enough to satisfy the volumes of the other two sectors 4 discussion 4 1 effect of the water resources management on average water scarcity risk as we mentioned in previous sections the existing indices were initially proposed as measures that compare annual volumes of available water resources and their use withdrawals or demands then for a given location the scarcity risk is determined by characterizing the average over a long period e g 20 years of the annual indices using a grading system in this study we computed the values of three existing indices namely wta dta and cadm using monthly instead of annual volumes to show how the seasonal variation of available water may cause misleading results an examples of assessment frameworks that use index long term averages is aqueduct 2 0 the wta and dta indices may take quite large values if the available water resources are small compared to the used volumes considering that a large portion of the obtained wta and dta indices is in the range 0 0 2 0 large values e g greater than 100 can have a considerable impact on the arithmetic mean average as an example let us consider the results of the dta index of the tone river basin on the one hand the long term mean of natural dta was equal to 2 93 and that of operated dta was equal to 1 04 both indicating risk this type of result can be discouraging for the people that implement the flow regulations on the other hand the median of natural and operated dta are equal to 0 20 and 0 19 respectively this outcome shows that a large percentage of the time the basin was not at risk and furthermore that the flow regulations had a positive impact however the median fails to reveal the potential risk in which the basin is during the months with extremely large values of the index in conclusion the long term statistics of indices expressed as ratios might be misleading and fail to represent the local efforts toward sustainable use of the water resources another factor that affects the average scarcity risk is how the volumes required for the maintenance of the aquatic ecosystems and others i e efr is included in the definition of the index in the expressions of wta and dta equations 1 and 3 respectively the available water resources are the difference between the river discharge i e rwr and efr because this difference is in the denominator of the wta and dta ratios large values can be obtained as efr approximates rwr thus months that are characterized as at risk by these indices are just showing that the municipal industrial and agricultural demand sectors were not able to meet their demand or withdrawal volumes even if there are large volumes of flow discharge actually the water resources managers have to decide how to regulate and allow the volumes of use including those intended for environmental purposes one of the objectives of this paper is to propose that efr should be included as one of the demand sectors to better reflect the local regulations in the indices of scarcity risk 4 2 water demand sectors affected by water scarcity in this paper we proposed an index namely ss dta that evaluates when and how many sectors might be potentially at risk during seasons with reduced river discharge we do so by considering the efr as one of the demand sectors fig 8 shows the mean over the analysed period of the monthly natural and operated river discharge as well as the demand volumes of each sector in fig 8a the river discharge of the tone river basin shows little change between natural and operated conditions it is notable how a large portion of demand volumes correspond to the environmental and agricultural sectors in the arakawa river basin fig 8b the demand volumes of the industrial and municipal sectors are quite small compared to those of the environmental and agricultural sectors the latter of which depicts considerable volumes during the summer season june to september because efr are defined as a function of the river discharge the environmental demand volumes show an increase between august and october as the river discharge does the operated discharge shows no months with values that are smaller than the sum of the total demands volume for winter month the sum of the total demand volumes approximate the natural river discharge however the inter basin water transfer mitigates the potential risk in the brantas river basin fig 8c the natural discharge from december to april is reduced by the river operation the objective of this observed trend in operated discharges is to avoid the potential risk during the river flood season on the other hand natural and operated river discharges do not show a significant difference during the low flow season july to october during the long flow season at most the efr could have constantly been affected during this period whereas the demand volumes of the agricultural and industrial sectors can potentially be affected in years with severe droughts therefore the river operation does not entirely mitigate the water scarcity risk the tone river basin has effects that the river discharge decreases in the flood season and increases in the low flow season the discharge of the arakawa river basin increases due to the transfer from the tone river basin which means that the water scarcity risk decreases in the brantas river basin the river operation is conducted with the aim at reducing the peak discharge during the flood season consequently it s the medians of wta and dta of this basin are larger in operated conditions the flow regulations decrease the flood risk during the flood season but it does not increase the water scarcity risk during the low flow season 4 3 advantages and limitations of ss dta the ss dta method considers efr as one of the water demand sectors instead of subtracting it from the rwr volumes this trait avoids generating extremely large values of the index even infinite when the available water resources do not satisfy all the water demands the ss dta score shows which sector is potentially at risk the reason for adopting this measure is that the ss dta score is assessed in a statistically representative dry year because actual scarcity risk occurs in drought years considering the inter annual variation of water cycles this method addresses each water demand sector to evaluate the balance of availability and demand monthly the number and priority order of the sector can be set based on local situations for example when the river is vital as a canal for water transportation systems the water level should be included as a water demand sector this study considers the water scarcity risk as a situation in which water users cannot use water when they want even if the annual average water resources seem enough there can be risk in months or days with discharge smaller than the demand volumes the ss dta index is useful by adopting statistical data with high temporal resolution and considering a statistically representative dry year a temporally high resolution database that includes observed runoff withdrawal volumes dam operation volumes water transfer to or from other river basins and demand volumes for relevant sectors makes possible a reliable assessment monthly or finer resolutions data are required for considering seasonal variations of availability and demand because in the tone river basin all of the abovementioned data are available a more detailed assessment could be conducted fig s5 shows the daily timeseries of the tone river basin in 1999 which is the year that approximates the 20 th percentile in terms of annual volumes of discharge the score of ss dta in the natural condition was equal to 2 because the natural discharge cannot satisfy the environmental and the agricultural demands on several days of june nevertheless in operating conditions the risk was alleviated as there were no days with ss dta scores over 1 throughout the year compared to other existing assessment methods of water scarcity risk the proposed index has two major advantages first the computation of the index uses monthly instead of annual accumulated volumes of supply and demand even if the annual total water supply is greater than the annual total demand there can be cases in which some demand sectors cannot utilize the local water resources in some months by using this method we can observe in which month which sector might not be able to satisfy its demand second the index is evaluated on a statistically representative year even if the water availability in mean year supply is greater than the average total demand there can be cases in which the demand sectors cannot utilize the local water resources during drought years the ss dta index evaluates risk by determining based on statistical data whether natural and operated discharge can satisfy the monthly water demands if the demand volumes are not satisfied the index can determine how many and which sectors will be potentially affected by water scarcity the results showed that the flow regulations in the tone and arakawa river basins successfully minimized the water scarcity risk during dry seasons of dry years we highlighted that the demand sectors and priority order may vary depending on the stakeholders in each watershed sometimes deciding whether a water use can be deemed a relevant demand sector can become an issue for example withdrawal for hydropower generation may demand large volumes of water and thus be considered a relevant demand sector however if we consider that almost all the withdrawn volumes return to the river it may not be a relevant demand for downstream water users stakeholders in each watershed should discuss and agree which water demand sectors should be considered as relevant this study does not specify nor propose demand sector that are valid worldwide it is possible to divide some demand sectors into sub sectors which will depend on the local stakeholders needs for example we could stablish two groups of demand sectors human activities and ecosystems the priorities should be assigned within each group however it is important to do it in a way that the division is mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive 5 conclusions this study developed a new index called ss dta that evaluates water scarcity risk at the watershed scale because this method is based not on water withdrawal by human activities but on water demands including those by humans and the environment the score represents how many sectors may satisfy their water demands volumes with the available water resources this method allows water users to assess whether itis possible to utilize local water resources during droughts the number type of sector and the priority order can be set based on the requirements of the users additionally the effects of infrastructure and its operation to alleviate the water scarcity risk can be evaluated by comparing natural and operated conditions of the river discharge the efr is considered as one of the demand sectors which makes it not necessary to use more than one index to verify which sector is affected by droughts the tone and arakawa rivers in japan are connected by the musashi suiro channel through which water is transported to the arakawa river basin to satisfy the massive demands around the tokyo metropolitan area the ss dta index obtained for the arakawa river basin in natural conditions was equal to 1 this value changed to 0 when it was computed in operated conditions which shows that the potential scarcity risk in which one of the demand sectors was was alleviated by the flow regulations for the brantas river basin in indonesia the ss dta were equal to 3 and 2 in natural and operated situations respectively the proposed index is able to reflect the better the local efforts toward better water resources management by utilizing data at temporally finer resolution and by evaluating it on a statistically representative year our future work will include the analysis of other basins around the world to verify its usefulness in evaluating scarcity under different local situations credit authorship contribution statement shinjiro yano conceptualization methodology writing

8587,a more objective assessment of the freshwater scarcity risk at a watershed basis scale contributes to the achievement of the sustainable development goals sdgs in which water plays a key role in issues like safe and affordable drinking water water related disasters forest management biodiversity and ecosystems within the sdgs water scarcity is assessed primarily by using the ratio of withdrawal to availability wta this index has been developed to evaluate the average annual conditions on a broad scale such as country or large basin however there are insufficient cases for assessing specific and detailed risk conditions by using this original wta concept due to seasonal and interannual variations of the river discharge and withdrawal volumes for example infrastructure e g large dams and its operation can drastically change the available water and demand volumes at temporal scales finer than annual because recently many daily and monthly records of river discharge and water use have become publicly available it is possible to conduct water scarcity risk assessments on a monthly basis by employing these datasets in this study we propose to compare volumes of available water and demand by using a sectoral and statistical demand to availability ss dta index the novelty of this index is marked not only by the use of monthly volumes of available and required water but also by how environmental water requirements are included and the statistical relevance of the evaluation usually to determine the available water resources existing methods deduct from the river discharge the volumes that are required to preserve the surrounding ecosystems our proposed method considers the environmental flow requirements as one of the water demand sectors allowing a simultaneous evaluation of water use that is not possible with existing methods we applied this method to three representative river basins two located in japan the tone and the arakawa river basins and the brantas river basin in indonesia the results showed the variations of water scarcity risk level through the river operation in each river basin in the tone river basin it was succeeded in a drought year to decrease its risk level from 1 to 0 and to transport sufficient volume of water to the arakawa river basin through an artificial channel to meet the demands at the same time in the brantas river basin the river operation changed the ss dta score from 3 to 2 which means the water scarcity risk level was alleviated while the main impact of the operation was found in high water season to decrease the flood risk because the number type and priority of water demands can be adjusted based on the local situation and all the timeseries data of each demand sector are visualized in parallel the result includes not only the whole risk level of the river basin but also the practical and specific degree of the risk with demand sector information abbreviations bws baseline water

development goals sdgs united nations 2018 as well as in their targets and indices water and its cycle are mentioned repeatedly indicating its vital importance in human activities social development and the surrounding environment examples can be found in goal 6 access to safe and affordable drinking water sustainable development knowledge platform 2019 goal 9 resilient infrastructure goal 11 water related disasters and goal 15 forest management biodiversity and ecosystems the vital role of water has motivated all around the world the scientific development of objective methods to assess its condition the japanese government enacted the water cycle basic act in 2014 which defines the basic philosophy and measures related to the water cycle in an integrated and comprehensive manner ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism japan 2008 2018 taniguchi 2015 it has become clear that to achieve a sound water cycle it is necessary to identify the situation of each watershed and to encourage efforts related to water resources management and conservation water unlike other natural resources like oil circulates and can be unevenly distributed in time and space throughout its cycle brutsaert 2005 oki and kanae 2006 postel et al 1996 because of this natural trait potential risks like water scarcity need to be evaluated based on the availability of water at different stages of the hydrological cycle to this end although quite similar several indices that measure water scarcity risk can be found in related literature commonly these indices are based on the ratio of withdrawal to availability wta one of the earliest studies to mention such a measure referred to it as the withdrawal to water resources index raskin et al 1997 the wta ratio was employed later in the works by reig et al 2013 and gassert et al 2015 which defined the baseline water stress index bws another example is the water stress index wsi that was developed based on the wta ratio introducing the seasonal variation of precipitation pfister et al 2009 2011 a different approach was proposed by boulay et al 2018 in which instead of focusing on the actual withdrawal the proposed demand to available water resources dta index evaluated the water volume needed to cope with a specific demand following on previous studies hoekstra et al 2012 introduced the ratio of consumptive water use to water availability evaluated at the monthly scale even though the abovementioned methods are useful in making annual broad i e large scale such as that of a country assessments of the water cycle condition and the potential scarcity risk they have shown limitations when applied at finer spatial and temporal scales on the one hand annual evaluations indicating that a watershed is not currently under water stress may fail to identify a water stress situation at the monthly scale and thus obviate a severe risk on the other hand annual evaluations indicating that a watershed is on the verge or passed the limit of water stress may come out from a river with strongly regulated flows these regulations like dam operations are aimed at covering seasonal demands and hence the watershed is misleadingly characterized as being at high risk to overcome these limitations hanasaki et al 2008a 2008b 2013 introduced the cumulative withdrawal to water demand ratio also known as the cumulative abstraction to demand cad ratio which shows the sufficiency level of the water supply to the water demand in other words this index can address whether there is enough water to withdraw while the cad ratio was evaluated annually in those studies the water supply and demand corresponded to estimations of daily values the above methods share a fundamental concept the scarcity risk is evaluated by comparing the volumes of water use and natural water resources where water use volume is defined in terms of either withdrawal consumption or demand as a side note for simplification the target 6 4 2 of the sdg defined the withdrawal as a proportion of the available freshwater resources to indicate the level of water stress united nations statistics division 2018 even though measurements of water withdrawal and more abundant water demand can be more suitable locations where water is scarce and at the same time there is a high demand of water water use may not only affect human health well being or economic activities but also aquatic ecosystems on this regard vanham et al 2018 noted that environmental flows need to be included in water stress assessments the impact assessment of water consumption based on available water resources aware boulay et al 2018 evaluated water scarcity by subtracting the environmental water requirements ewr from the available water resources and employing a monthly scale approach that considers five major habitat types including main freshwater ecoregions pastor et al 2014 because environmental water requirements are sensitive to changes on regional climate regulations and awareness global or large scale assessments of water scarcity need to include these circumstances to reflect the local efforts aimed at reducing risks because of seasonal variations the natural water supply is not constant throughout the year consequently the actual available volume of water resources during certain seasons can be much less than the average annual volume the aqueduct 2 0 reig et al 2013 water resources assessment framework incorporates indices to evaluate seasonal and interannual variations in water resources but these indices are independent of the computation of the bws and therefore may not precisely represent water stress or risk later aqueduct 3 0 hofste et al 2019 included the monthly variations of withdrawal of available water to overcome the temporal misrepresentation of the bws index of the previous version in another study hanasaki et al 2008a 2008b compared globally several indices that evaluate the water resources and found out that based on indices that are a function of the annual volumes there are areas with an underestimated water risk level this finding proved that the actual water risk cannot be assessed with the annual volume of water resources and that data at temporally finer resolutions are required to assess the sufficiency level of water supply to water demand fortunately there are many available observed data regarding local water resources and use on a daily or monthly basis considering that monthly and daily records related to water resources have been increasing worldwide we consider that the improvement of accuracy of water risk assessments is possible although the existing evaluation indices particulaly wta and dta are sufficient to grasp the annual conditions temporal fine resolution data can improve our understanding of water scarcity risk one of the principal reasons is that even if annual precipitation does not vary the daily and monthly volumes of water resources can be altered with infrastructure and water management e g dam operation another example of alterations of the natural water flow is the long range transportation of water employing the water footprint assessment framework yano et al 2018 noted that the inter basin transfer changed the evaluation of water risk for both water sending and water receiving watersheds another factor that affects the water resources assessments and is still subject of discussion is the volumes of withdrawn water that were not consumed and returned to the watershed for example although the withdrawn water volumes for irrigation of paddy fields are considerable a large non consumed portion returns to the original watershed either by natural flow and infiltration drainage water from industrial use is also released to the surface waters after treatment if these volumes of returned or released water is not included in the available water resource the assessment indices may overestimate the water scarcity risk the review made above of the existing water scarcity risk assessment methods and limitations shows that improvements can still be made to accurately represent the actual situation of water resources in the watersheds these improvements can be made seasonal interannual variability of natural water resources the artificial variation of water resources the impact of non consumed that returns to the watershed and the environmental water requirements in this study we developed a new index for assessing the water scarcity risk by improving the dta index so that it includes the seasonal and interannual variations the demand volumes differentiated by sector i e industrial domestic agricultural and the environmental flow requirements in this manner this new sectoral and statistical demand to availability ss dta index is aimed at better representing the actual water resources state in terms of water supply and demand at a temporal resolution finer than that of the dta index the ss dta index was calculated to assess three watersheds in asia using local data we believe that a much more objective assessment like the one that can be achieved with the proposed index may provide more detailed information about available water in the watershed scarcity risk and the positive impact of water resources management more comprehensive representations of the actual water resources state and the sustainability of the current planned freshwater use may become an incentive for nations local governments non governmental organizations ngos and companies to implement or improve their water conservation and management policies 2 material and methods 2 1 study area in this study the tone and arakawa rivers in japan and the brantas river in indonesia were chosen as the study areas fig 1 shows the location and land use of each river basin the two japanese rivers are located in the kanto region and are the main freshwater source in the capital region ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism japan 2008 this region has vast records and detailed information about dam operation in the upstream the withdrawal volumes and the transferred volumes that are possible through the musashi suiro channel this cannel connects the tone river and the arakawa river and was built to conduct water to the arakawa river and meet the demand volumes around the tokyo metropolitan area japan water agency 2019 using global estimates of water supply and demand gassert et al 2015 calculated the bws index which has a five category grading system of risk i e low less than 0 1 low to medium 0 1 to 0 2 medium to high 0 2 to 0 4 high 0 4 to 0 8 and extremely high greater than 0 8 the tone river basin was characterized as being in medium to high risk bws 0 356 while the risk of the arakawa river basin was deemed high bws 0 529 based on the global estimates on the other hand using the available local data yano et al 2018 included the effect of the inter basin water transfer in the computation of the bws index because the volume of the transported water transported corresponded to 45 of the naturally available the computed bws of the arakawa river decreased from 0 387 to 0 268 corresponding to a medium to high value due to water transportation the brantas river is the longest river in east java surabaja the second largest city in indonesia is located in its delta in the river there are large dams such as sutami lodoyo and wlingi fujimoto 2013 after spiralling the brantas river flows into the bali sea however large volumes are diverted through the nejama tunnel into the indian ocean even though the diverted volumes are used for hydraulic power generation it also prevents downstream floods river discharge and dam operation records were measured by jasa tirta i public corporation pjt 1 in the aqueduct 2 0 assessment framework using global data the bws index characterized the brantas river basin as being in extremely high risk gassert et al 2015 2 2 data collection the evaluations that we made in this study were for natural conditions and operated conditions natural conditions correspond to discharges if there were no flow regulating infrastructure whereas operated conditions correspond to water resources with some kind of man made alterations such as dam operation or transfer since the three target river basins have flow regulating infrastructure the observed river discharge corresponds to operated conditions the natural conditions were then inferred using the dam operation and water transfer records we chose the kurihashi station records of observed daily discharge as available water resources of the tone river basin which is the location where water is transferred to the arakawa river basin the river discharge is affected by the operation of the following upstream dams yagisawa naramata fujiwara aimata sonohara shimokubo kusaki and watarase thus the inlet and outlet flows as well as the water transportation to the arakawa river basin were necessary in our study the flow in natural conditions of the tone river was calculated by adding the water transportation volume to the discharge observed at the kurihashi station and the flow in operated conditions was calculated by adding the outflows of the dam operation to the natural flow we also obtained the demand and actual withdrawal data for municipal agricultural and industrial water use in the tone river basin this data details of which are described in yano et al 2018 correspond to daily records from 1989 to 2014 and accumulated into monthly values since we considered available water and demand in the tone river basin at the kurihashi station the results are representive of the entire watershed but only of the middle and upper regions we chose the records of observed daily discharge at the river mouth of the arakawa river as available water resources the inlet and outlet flows of the futase takizawa urayama kakkau and arima dams and the arakawa reservoir were required in this study the volumes of water demand and withdrawal were obtained in the same way as explained above for the tone river basin for the brantas river pjt 1 facilitated monthly data of water demand for each sector river discharge dam operation and water transportation from 2003 to 2012 the demand for agricultural water use corresponds to the irrigation volumes at mrican kanan mrican kiri jati melerek menturus and delta brantas the demand for municipal water use was defined as the water used for baths kitchens and restrooms in residential areas and the industrial water use corresponds to that of industrial facilities private factories and non domestic water use i e commercial water use in shopping malls and public areas such as schools and government offices flows of naatural and operated conditions of the brantas river represent the discharge at new lengkong the natural flow was calculated by subtracting the water volumes changes by infrastructure i e dam operation and transportation and adding the water volumes that were used for irrigation but were not returned the course flowing by new lengkong the operated flow was calculated by adding the irrigated and not returned flow to the observed discharge which means that the observed discharge reflects the effect of infrastructure such as dam operation and transportation 2 3 methods 2 3 1 environmental flow requirements efr the maintenance flow rates reserved for conservation of flora and fauna i e 59 0 m3 s 1 for the tone river basin and 5 0 m3 s 1 for the arakawa river basin were used as efr respectively these values are defined as constant throughout the year however because temporal variation is important for ecosystems we made the exercise of comparing the maintenance flow rates with the efr proposed in two previous studies pastor et al 2014 shirakawa 2005 which are based on the monthly average river discharge fig 2 shows the calculated values of efr for each river basin where efr p refers to the ones calculated using the method proposed by pastor et al 2014 efr s refers to ones using the method of shirakawa 2005 and efr l refers to the local maintenance flow rates additionally we defined efr pd5 as the efr that would be obtained with the method of pastor et al 2014 but using only the monthly discharges in the year that approximates the 20th percentile in terms of annual volumes for the tone and arakawa river basins the efr pd5 was calculated using data of the 20 year period from 1991 to 2010 the choice of the optimal efr computation method depends on how well the values approximate the maintenance flow rates efr l during the dry season which lasts from january to march for the tone river basin fig 2a the efr p curve roughly satisfies the maintenance flow rates during the dry season unlike the other two methods for the arakawa river basin fig 2b efr pd5 does not only satisfy the maintenance flow rates during the dry season but also keeps reasonable levels above the efr l curve throughout the year for the brantas river basin the japan international cooperation agency jica 1998 established a maintenance flow rates equal to 32 1 m3 s 1 at new lengkong this value referred to as efr l corresponded to the 5th percentile of the observed river discharge in that study in fig 2c during the dry season which lasts from july to october the efr pd5 curve depicts values larger than those of the efr s curve but smaller than those of the efr p curve more importantly the efr pd5 curve satisfies the maintenance flow rates efr l during this period the efr of each river basin was calculated based on the river discharge at the locations detailed in the previous section kurihashi station in the tone river basin the mouth of the arakawa river and new lengkong in the brantas river basin 2 3 2 consumption rate the demand of water was calculated from the record of water withdrawal and consumption rate of each sector in this study consumption rate consists of consumption through evapotranspiration cet and consumption through non return flow crf where cet is the ratio of water consumed after withdrawal including evaporation transpiration and export volumes from the watershed and crf is the ratio of water that is released into a different watershed from the perspective of a downstream water user the crf rate is assumed to be a consumption from the original basin the consumption rate in each river basin was set as follows table 1 shows the consumption rates of each water demand sector in the tone river basin in which 0 35 was adopted as cet for agricultural water this value is the same as the one adopted by hanasaki et al 2013 and döll and siebert 2002 as an irrigation efficiency in japan since all the returned volumes flow to the same basin crf is set equal to zero the cet for industrial and municipal water were set equal to 0 15 and 0 10 respectively these values are the same as the ones shiklomanov 2000 and hanasaki et al 2008a 2013 adopted for evaporated portion of the total withdrawal based on the water network of the tone river basin we determined that around 10 of withdrawn water above the kurihashi station is discharged into the river below kurihashi as sewerage hence the crf rate is set equal to 0 10 for the arakawa river basin the consumption rate cet for agricultural industrial and municipal use were determined in the same way as for the tone river basin since all the returned water is discharged back to the same watershed crf was set equal to 0 as shown in table 2 based on jica 1998 which includes data related to local irrigation conditions in the brantas river basin we set cet equal to 0 70 the same report also mentioned that the returned volumes flow directly from the brantas delta to the sea hence we set the crf rate equal to 0 30 for the brantas delta we set the cet rate for industrial and municipal water equal to those defined and used in shiklomanov 2000 and hanasaki et al 2008a 2013 because the exact location of the discharge is unknown and because we wanted to assume a maximum impact of the demand volumes the total consumption rates were set equal to 1 0 as shown in table 3 2 3 3 withdrawal to availability wta withdrawal to availability which is similar in definition to the bws is calculated as follows 1 wta c w w r w r e f r 2 rwr q obs w w where rwr is the renewable water resource expressed as the monthly discharge of each river m3 s 1 ww is the monthly water withdrawal m3 s 1 efr is the environmental flow requirement based on efr p for the tone river basin and efr pd5 for the arakawa and the brantas river basins m3 s 1 c is the demand sector i e municipal industrial and agricultural use and qobs is the observed discharge of each river basin because qobs corresponds to the remaining water resource after subtracting the upstream withdrawal volumes rwr calculated as the total volume of ww and qobs when efr is larger than rwr the denominator in equation 1 is set equal to 1 0 the values of wta and rwr are calculated for natural and operated conditions the operated conditions include the effect of dam operation and the transfer of water to the arakawa river basin therefore in natural or operated conditions wta is referred to as natural or operated wta it is worth mentioning that the bws index does not explicitly take into account efr although they were implicitly considered at the time of defining the categorization grading system hofste et al 2019 in this study the efr are considered as one of the water demand volumes at the time of computing the wta ratio 2 3 4 demand to availability dta demand to availability focuses not on the actual withdrawal of water but on the volume of water needed locally the dta in this study is calculated as follows 3 dta c w d r w r e f r 4 wd w w k cons where wd is the water demand of each category c kcons is defined as shown in tables 1 2 and 3 when efr is larger than rwr the denominator in equation 1 is set equal to 1 0 like the computation of wta dta is computed for natural and operated conditions therefore in natural or operated conditions dta is referred to as natural or operated dta the dta was proposed by boulay et al 2014 referring intensity of the water demand in comparison with availability in a region the availability and human demand were calculated on a monthly time step in boulay et al 2018 2 3 5 a modified abstraction to demand ratio the cad index as presented in hanasaki et al 2013 is the ratio of annually accumulated withdrawal and demand volumes which was computed using modelled quantities of withdrawal because getting actual volumes of withdrawal depends on broad statistics and may not always be accurately estimated in this study we tried the proxy ww min wd rwr using the available monthly data of wd and rwr it is easy to see that the withdrawal volumes ww cannot be larger than those required wd nor those available rwr accordingly let us define a modified ratio of hanasaki s cad index cadm as shown in eq 5 5 cad m m i n r w r c w d c w d when rwr is larger than the total water demand i e the demand volumes were fully met by the river discharge cadm is at most equal to 1 0 like the previous indices in natural or operated conditions cadm is referred to as natural or operated cadm 2 3 6 sectoral and statistical dta ss dta in this study we propose to modify the dta ratio which represents the sufficiency level of available water resources to demand volumes to better represent the local management of the available water resources this improvement was achieved by including monthly variations of available and demand water volumes by changing the grading system which takes only integer values that range from zero to the number of demand sectors and by evaluating the scarcity risk on a probabilistically representative year the proposed index is defined as follows description ss dta score 6 c 1 c max mwd d y 20 mrwr d y 20 0 c 1 i mwd d y 20 mrwr d y 20 c 1 i 1 mwd d y 20 i 1 c max c max i mrwr d y 20 c 1 1 mwd d y 20 i and c take only integer values c max where mwd refers to monthly values of wd mrwr refers to monthly values of rwr the subscript dy20 refers to the year that approximates the 20th percentile of the annual discharges and c refers to the demand sectors i e municipal industrial agricultural and environmental note that within the demand sectors we included the efr in this manner it can be determined whether the available water resources not only meet the demand volumes related to human activities but also those of the aquatic ecosystems and other environmental requirements if ss dta is equal to zero it means that no demand sector is at risk larger values are equal to the number of demand sectors that are at risk during the dry season the fact that the proposed index takes only integer values makes it more intelligible and comparable with past conditions post policy change future conditions operated conditions and even with the indices of neighbouring watersheds the comparative expressions in equation 6 require that we assign a level of priority to each demand sector according to the japanese law regarding the use of water bodies the management and operation of flow regulating infrastructure during dry periods does not specify a particular order of priority instead the water users are advised to manage the water resources in a spirit of mutual trust and cooperation the authors have agreed that for research purposes in this study we assign more priority to municipal domestic demand volumes followed by industrial agricultural and flow maintenance demand volumes naturally the order of priority depends on local policies and awareness but this flexible trait can be important at the country administration level for comparing regional efforts towards more sustainable use of water resources as mentioned before the scarcity risk is intended to be evaluated on a statistically representative year i e the year that approximates the 20th percentile of the annual river discharge records the choice of percentile was based on an analysis of the local management plans of each watershed for example the water resources development plan of the tone arakawa river system was designed considering droughts with non exceedance probability of 10 jica 2004 in the brantas river basin the water resources development plan specified designs of irrigation structures considering the lowest flow in the 20 years of records but recommended the verification of these using droughts with non exceedance probability of 10 jica 1998 in this study to be on the safe side we employed the data of the year that approximates the 20th percentile of the annual discharge which could be assumed to be an estimator of the non exceedance probability of 20 the percentile can be set based not only on water resource management plans but also local stakeholder agreements or infrastructure design norms like the existing indices henceforth in natural or operated conditions ss dta is referred to as natural or operated ss dta 3 results 3 1 water risk of the tone river basin evaluated using existing indices as a reminder according to the definition of the existing indices employed in this study for the wta and dta indices values larger than 1 00 imply that the water resources are at risk contrarily a cadm index can take values in the range 0 00 to 1 00 and any value different than 1 0 implies some level of scarcity risk i e the available water resources do not meet the demands fig 3 shows the computed values using the existing indices i e wta dta and cadm from 1989 to 2010 22 years for the tone river basin the timeseries figure is shown in fig s1 this river basin tends to have larger wta and dta during winter december to february and summer june to august the computed values of natural wta were greater than 1 00 i e denoting risk in 58 out of the 264 months 22 12 whereas the one of operated wta denoted risk in 52 out of the 264 months fig 3a this result means that the dam operation has a positive impact by reducing water scarcity risk for example in june 1990 the computed value of natural wta equal to 117 decreased to a value of operated wta equal to 3 45 other similar examples in the same timeseries are from 119 to 2 95 in june 1994 from 123 to 6 35 in august 1995 and from 119 to 3 55 in august 2004 in the previous examples even though the values of operated wta were much smaller they were still greater than 1 00 these outcomes are a consequence of the dam operation increasing the flow discharge but not meeting the total demand volumes including efr however for several months the computation of operated wta yielded larger values than the ones of natural wta examples are april 1993 natural wta 0 36 and operated wta 1 17 april 1996 natural wta 0 51 and operated wta 1 18 november 1996 natural wta 0 65 and operated wta 1 31 these results were obtained because the flow discharge in operated conditions was calculated considering the increase caused by the dam operation and the decrease caused by the water transfer to the arakawa river basin and thus it can be smaller than the discharge in natural conditions regarding the dta index the number of months denoting risk was less than that obtained for wta where natural and operated dta were greater than 1 0 in 32 and 22 out of the 264 months fig 3b respectively while wta is calculated based on water withdrawal dta is based on water demand the actual demand volumes of water consumption tend to be smaller than those of withdrawal especially in the agricultural sector a large portion of the withdrawn water that was not consumed 65 in the case of the tone river basin is released back to the original watershed in fig 3c because cadm does not consider efr the results showed less occurrence of risk than those of wta and dta while natural cadm yielded one month with a value smaller than 1 0 the operated cadm did not generate values other than 1 0 during the whole 22 years period excluding efr this result shows that the dam operation can sufficiently meet the water demands of municipal industrial and agricultural sectors in natural conditions the 264 month average values of wta dta and cadm were equal to 6 80 2 93 and 1 00 respectively whereas in operated conditions these indices changed to 2 43 1 04 and 1 00 respectively the median values in natural conditions were equal to 0 39 0 20 and 1 00 respectively whereas in operated conditions these indices changed to 0 39 0 19 and 1 00 respectively 3 2 water risk of the arakawa river basin evaluated using existing indices fig 4 shows the computed values using the existing indices for the arakawa river basin the timeseries figure is shown in fig s2 the observations made about the different results that were obtained by using the data in natural and operated conditions are quite similar to those of the tone river basin the indices obtained in operated conditions tend to be smaller than those in natural conditions however the degree to which operated conditions mitigated the periods that were at risk in natural conditions is much more noticeable than what was observed for the tone river basin while wta indices in natural conditions yielded 120 out of 264 months denoting risk in operated conditions only one out of 264 months denoted risk the operated wta of february 1996 was equal to 1 01 fig 4a similarly the 10 months out of the 264 that yielded values of natural dta above 1 0 i e denoting risk yielded operated dta indices smaller than 1 0 fig 4b this positive outcome was caused by water transportation from the tone river basin through the musashi suiro channel and agrees with the findings of yano et al 2018 where it was pointed out that the water transfer decreased the scarcity risk characterization of this watershed from high bws 0 387 to medium to high bws 0 268 regarding the cadm index fig 4c both natural and operated conditions did not yield values other than 1 00 implying that all the demand volumes in the arakawa river basin were met sufficiently in natural conditions the 264 month average values of wta dta and cadm were equal to 1 79 0 34 and 1 00 respectively whereas in operated conditions these indices changed to 0 42 0 08 and 1 00 respectively the median values in natural conditions were equal to 0 87 0 18 and 1 00 respectively whereas in operated conditions these indices changed to 0 40 0 08 and 1 00 respectively 3 3 water risk of the brantas river basin evaluated using existing indices fig 5 shows the computed values using the existing indicators for the brantas river basin the timeseries figure is shown in fig s3 because the evaluation period 10 years from 2003 to 2012 was different from that of the tone and arakawa river basins 22 years from 1989 to 2010 we analyse the outcomes separately curiously opposite to what was observed in the results of the other two basins where in operated conditions the months denoting risk were less than those in natural conditions for the brantas river basin the values of operated wta and dta showed more months denoting risk than those in natural conditions the values of natural and operated wta showed that 48 and 53 out of 120 months respectively denoted risk i e were greater than 1 0 likewise the values of natural and operated dta showed that 49 and 55 out of 120 months respectively denoted risk despite the outcome described above the average values of natural wta and dta were smaller than those in operated conditions this result means that the degree of scarcity risk was alleviated by the water resource management such as large dam operations the results showed no month in which the natural or operated rwr were smaller than the efr consequently the largest values of natural wta and dta were 5 81 and 6 43 respectively the results of the cadm index were similar to those of the wta and dta index the number of months denoting risk i e yielding a cadm index smaller than 1 0 were 34 and 40 for natural and operated conditions respectively the most critical value of the cadm index in natural conditions was 0 55 which due to dam operation was alleviated to a value of operated cadm equal to 0 68 in natural conditions the 120 month average values of wta dta and cadm were equal to 1 24 1 28 and 0 93 respectively whereas in operated conditions these indices changed to 1 23 1 27 and 0 94 respectively the median values in natural conditions were equal to 0 67 0 71 and 1 00 respectively whereas in operated conditions these indices changed to 0 85 0 88 and 1 00 respectively 3 4 ss dta of each river basin fig 6 shows the computed ss dta on a monthly basis for each of the three river basins the water demands of each sector including efr is separately illustrated to let us assess which ones are not sufficiently met by the volumes of natural rwr and how the outcome changes in operated conditions as mentioned previously the demand sector to which we assigned the highest priority is the municipal followed by the industrial the agricultural and the environmental in that order the timeseries figure is shown in fig s4 for the tine river basin fig 6a the monthly river discharge rwr was larger than the sum of the demand volumes of the four sectors in 232 out of the 264 months in operated conditions the number of months in which the operated ss dta was equal to 0 increased to 242 for 31 out of 264 months the efr could not be met in natural conditions but due to flow regulations operated conditions the same situation was observed only for 22 out of 264 months also for 1 out of 264 months the efr and agricultural demand volumes could not be met in natural conditions but due to flow regulations only efr could not be met in that month during the droughts of the whole 22 year period industrial and municipal demand volumes were not potentially at risk neither in natural nor operated conditions for the arakawa river basin fig 6b for 11 out of the 264 months the efr could not be met in natural conditions but due to flow regulations operated conditions the accumulated demand volumes of the four sectors were met during the whole period this result means that drought could have had a potential impact on the efr if proper flow regulations like water transfer and dam operation had not been undertaken for the brantas river basin fig 6c in natural conditions efr were potentially at risk for 15 out of 120 months efr and agricultural demand volumes were potentially at risk for 32 out of 120 months and efr agricultural and industrial demand volumes were potentially at risk for 2 out of 120 months due to flow regulations operated conditions the previous number of months changed to 15 40 and 0 respectively interestingly for operated conditions although the number of months in which efr agricultural and industrial demand volumes could have been potentially at risk decreased to zero the number of months in which efr and agricultural demand volumes could have been at risk increased the values of ss dta index that were obtained for each river basin are shown in fig 7 the year for which the annual discharge approximated the 20th percentile of the records is 1999 for the tone and the arakawa river basins and 2004 for the brantas river basin the natural ss dta of the tone river basin was equal to 1 because the efr could not be satisfied by the natural discharge in february and june the operated ss dta was equal to 0 because of an increase of the river discharge for these month as a result of the flow regulations fig 7a for the arakawa river basin fig 7b the natural ss dta was equal to 1 in which was the environmental sector could not be satisfied by the natural discharge in february however due to the flow regulations the operated ss dta was equal to 0 as a result of an increase in the february river discharge the natural ss dta of the brantas river basin was equal to 3 in which the environmental agricultural and industrial demand sectors could be potentially affected by the low flow in october the value of operated ss dta was equal to 2 which means that the flow regulations signified and increase in the october flow discharge enough to satisfy the accumulated demand volumes of the municipal and industrial sectors but not enough to satisfy the volumes of the other two sectors 4 discussion 4 1 effect of the water resources management on average water scarcity risk as we mentioned in previous sections the existing indices were initially proposed as measures that compare annual volumes of available water resources and their use withdrawals or demands then for a given location the scarcity risk is determined by characterizing the average over a long period e g 20 years of the annual indices using a grading system in this study we computed the values of three existing indices namely wta dta and cadm using monthly instead of annual volumes to show how the seasonal variation of available water may cause misleading results an examples of assessment frameworks that use index long term averages is aqueduct 2 0 the wta and dta indices may take quite large values if the available water resources are small compared to the used volumes considering that a large portion of the obtained wta and dta indices is in the range 0 0 2 0 large values e g greater than 100 can have a considerable impact on the arithmetic mean average as an example let us consider the results of the dta index of the tone river basin on the one hand the long term mean of natural dta was equal to 2 93 and that of operated dta was equal to 1 04 both indicating risk this type of result can be discouraging for the people that implement the flow regulations on the other hand the median of natural and operated dta are equal to 0 20 and 0 19 respectively this outcome shows that a large percentage of the time the basin was not at risk and furthermore that the flow regulations had a positive impact however the median fails to reveal the potential risk in which the basin is during the months with extremely large values of the index in conclusion the long term statistics of indices expressed as ratios might be misleading and fail to represent the local efforts toward sustainable use of the water resources another factor that affects the average scarcity risk is how the volumes required for the maintenance of the aquatic ecosystems and others i e efr is included in the definition of the index in the expressions of wta and dta equations 1 and 3 respectively the available water resources are the difference between the river discharge i e rwr and efr because this difference is in the denominator of the wta and dta ratios large values can be obtained as efr approximates rwr thus months that are characterized as at risk by these indices are just showing that the municipal industrial and agricultural demand sectors were not able to meet their demand or withdrawal volumes even if there are large volumes of flow discharge actually the water resources managers have to decide how to regulate and allow the volumes of use including those intended for environmental purposes one of the objectives of this paper is to propose that efr should be included as one of the demand sectors to better reflect the local regulations in the indices of scarcity risk 4 2 water demand sectors affected by water scarcity in this paper we proposed an index namely ss dta that evaluates when and how many sectors might be potentially at risk during seasons with reduced river discharge we do so by considering the efr as one of the demand sectors fig 8 shows the mean over the analysed period of the monthly natural and operated river discharge as well as the demand volumes of each sector in fig 8a the river discharge of the tone river basin shows little change between natural and operated conditions it is notable how a large portion of demand volumes correspond to the environmental and agricultural sectors in the arakawa river basin fig 8b the demand volumes of the industrial and municipal sectors are quite small compared to those of the environmental and agricultural sectors the latter of which depicts considerable volumes during the summer season june to september because efr are defined as a function of the river discharge the environmental demand volumes show an increase between august and october as the river discharge does the operated discharge shows no months with values that are smaller than the sum of the total demands volume for winter month the sum of the total demand volumes approximate the natural river discharge however the inter basin water transfer mitigates the potential risk in the brantas river basin fig 8c the natural discharge from december to april is reduced by the river operation the objective of this observed trend in operated discharges is to avoid the potential risk during the river flood season on the other hand natural and operated river discharges do not show a significant difference during the low flow season july to october during the long flow season at most the efr could have constantly been affected during this period whereas the demand volumes of the agricultural and industrial sectors can potentially be affected in years with severe droughts therefore the river operation does not entirely mitigate the water scarcity risk the tone river basin has effects that the river discharge decreases in the flood season and increases in the low flow season the discharge of the arakawa river basin increases due to the transfer from the tone river basin which means that the water scarcity risk decreases in the brantas river basin the river operation is conducted with the aim at reducing the peak discharge during the flood season consequently it s the medians of wta and dta of this basin are larger in operated conditions the flow regulations decrease the flood risk during the flood season but it does not increase the water scarcity risk during the low flow season 4 3 advantages and limitations of ss dta the ss dta method considers efr as one of the water demand sectors instead of subtracting it from the rwr volumes this trait avoids generating extremely large values of the index even infinite when the available water resources do not satisfy all the water demands the ss dta score shows which sector is potentially at risk the reason for adopting this measure is that the ss dta score is assessed in a statistically representative dry year because actual scarcity risk occurs in drought years considering the inter annual variation of water cycles this method addresses each water demand sector to evaluate the balance of availability and demand monthly the number and priority order of the sector can be set based on local situations for example when the river is vital as a canal for water transportation systems the water level should be included as a water demand sector this study considers the water scarcity risk as a situation in which water users cannot use water when they want even if the annual average water resources seem enough there can be risk in months or days with discharge smaller than the demand volumes the ss dta index is useful by adopting statistical data with high temporal resolution and considering a statistically representative dry year a temporally high resolution database that includes observed runoff withdrawal volumes dam operation volumes water transfer to or from other river basins and demand volumes for relevant sectors makes possible a reliable assessment monthly or finer resolutions data are required for considering seasonal variations of availability and demand because in the tone river basin all of the abovementioned data are available a more detailed assessment could be conducted fig s5 shows the daily timeseries of the tone river basin in 1999 which is the year that approximates the 20 th percentile in terms of annual volumes of discharge the score of ss dta in the natural condition was equal to 2 because the natural discharge cannot satisfy the environmental and the agricultural demands on several days of june nevertheless in operating conditions the risk was alleviated as there were no days with ss dta scores over 1 throughout the year compared to other existing assessment methods of water scarcity risk the proposed index has two major advantages first the computation of the index uses monthly instead of annual accumulated volumes of supply and demand even if the annual total water supply is greater than the annual total demand there can be cases in which some demand sectors cannot utilize the local water resources in some months by using this method we can observe in which month which sector might not be able to satisfy its demand second the index is evaluated on a statistically representative year even if the water availability in mean year supply is greater than the average total demand there can be cases in which the demand sectors cannot utilize the local water resources during drought years the ss dta index evaluates risk by determining based on statistical data whether natural and operated discharge can satisfy the monthly water demands if the demand volumes are not satisfied the index can determine how many and which sectors will be potentially affected by water scarcity the results showed that the flow regulations in the tone and arakawa river basins successfully minimized the water scarcity risk during dry seasons of dry years we highlighted that the demand sectors and priority order may vary depending on the stakeholders in each watershed sometimes deciding whether a water use can be deemed a relevant demand sector can become an issue for example withdrawal for hydropower generation may demand large volumes of water and thus be considered a relevant demand sector however if we consider that almost all the withdrawn volumes return to the river it may not be a relevant demand for downstream water users stakeholders in each watershed should discuss and agree which water demand sectors should be considered as relevant this study does not specify nor propose demand sector that are valid worldwide it is possible to divide some demand sectors into sub sectors which will depend on the local stakeholders needs for example we could stablish two groups of demand sectors human activities and ecosystems the priorities should be assigned within each group however it is important to do it in a way that the division is mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive 5 conclusions this study developed a new index called ss dta that evaluates water scarcity risk at the watershed scale because this method is based not on water withdrawal by human activities but on water demands including those by humans and the environment the score represents how many sectors may satisfy their water demands volumes with the available water resources this method allows water users to assess whether itis possible to utilize local water resources during droughts the number type of sector and the priority order can be set based on the requirements of the users additionally the effects of infrastructure and its operation to alleviate the water scarcity risk can be evaluated by comparing natural and operated conditions of the river discharge the efr is considered as one of the demand sectors which makes it not necessary to use more than one index to verify which sector is affected by droughts the tone and arakawa rivers in japan are connected by the musashi suiro channel through which water is transported to the arakawa river basin to satisfy the massive demands around the tokyo metropolitan area the ss dta index obtained for the arakawa river basin in natural conditions was equal to 1 this value changed to 0 when it was computed in operated conditions which shows that the potential scarcity risk in which one of the demand sectors was was alleviated by the flow regulations for the brantas river basin in indonesia the ss dta were equal to 3 and 2 in natural and operated situations respectively the proposed index is able to reflect the better the local efforts toward better water resources management by utilizing data at temporally finer resolution and by evaluating it on a statistically representative year our future work will include the analysis of other basins around the world to verify its usefulness in evaluating scarcity under different local situations credit authorship contribution statement shinjiro yano conceptualization methodology writing

water supply systems this study assesses water demand and cost tradeoffs among strategies in three u s cities denver co miami fl and tucson az a comprehensive set of strategies to reduce demand for

use behaviors efficient irrigation systems were highly effective across the study cities when considering cost and demand reduction tradeoffs stormwater use has large potential for demand reduction even in arid regions but is a very costly strategy when alternate water sources are considered wastewater use for irrigation and graywater use for toilet flushing at the multi residential scale offer

demand on diminishing water supplies and aging infrastructure cities are looking to new strategies to manage water strategies that reduce demand for traditional water supplies water conservation and fit for purpose water use in particular are of interest to cities to meet future water supply targets and achieve one water goals daigger et al 2019 fit for purpose water use includes treatment of alternate water sources to appropriate levels to the appropriate quality for the end use daigger et al 2019 efficient use of water to meet demand has resulted in declining water use in the us where average residential indoor use has reduced from 177 gallons per household per day in 1999 to 138 gallons per household per day from in 2016 deoreo et al 2016 however even more efficient use of water can still be achieved and many alternate water sources remain untapped decisions on which water demand reduction strategies to encourage are complex efficacy of strategies that reduce demand for traditional supplies is impacted by climate land use and population density nrc 2016 in addition costs are not well understood for implementing water reuse strategies from the building to municipal scale improved understanding of costs and benefits of water conservation and fit for purpose water use strategies is needed this includes the need to understand how those costs and benefits are impacted by local considerations water demand reduction strategies can be divided into two categories end use efficiency and use of alternate water sources to increase supply end use efficiency can be achieved for both indoor and outdoor water demand via technological advancements or behavioral changes resulting from awareness campaigns or water pricing indoor water use efficiency is often achieved by installation of low water use fixtures and appliances with the most common and effective to date being low flush toilets and high efficiency laundry machines deoreo et al 2016 outdoor water efficiency can be achieved through use of smart irrigation systems efficient sprinkler heads and irrigation systems conversion to climate appropriate landscape and behavioral changes increasing water supplies through use of alternate water sources to meet potable and non potable demand is also an attractive option the most common alternate water sources are treated wastewater graywater stormwater and roof runoff sharvelle et al 2017b these source waters can be treated to meet either potable or non potable demand depending on regulatory considerations decisions on most effective strategies to reduce demand for traditional supplies are complex and depend on the objectives of the decision wilcox and nasiri 2016 some studies have compared water demand reduction strategies beneficial use of graywater and stormwater were compared across six us cities nrc 2016 the study found that graywater serves a consistent source of water throughout the year particularly in semi arid and arid regions and concluded that large storage is needed for stormwater use systems to be effective an australian study of 15 integrated management projects across the country demonstrated successful reductions in potable water supply positive community acceptance and lower water bills mitchell 2006 the sites were small neighborhood to regional scale and included many innovative systems of stormwater graywater and wastewater as supply sites with combinations of reuse systems and conservation saw potable water savings of 40 to 80 mitchell 2006 sharvelle et al 2017a assessed the demand reduction potential of a large set of water conservation and reuse strategies in fort collins co in this study outdoor water use efficiency was found to be very effective for demand reduction amongst the strategies assessed another study conducted by cooley and phurisamban 2016 focused on water conservation and reuse strategies only in california wastewater recycling for non potable reuse was found to be less expensive than indirect potable reuse because of lower treatment requirements many of the efficiency measures and conversion to climate appropriate landscape had a negative life cycle cost meaning water savings cost over the lifetime of the measure are greater than the cost to implement some studies have gone beyond comparisons of demand reduction associated with water conservation and reuse strategies and have used life cycle assessment to compare water conservation and reuse strategies one study assessed low impact development lid technologies consisting of roof runoff for irrigation and toilet flushing xeriscaping and stormwater collection in bio retention to supply non potable water jeong et al 2016 this study was conducted for atlanta ga another lca study by jeong et al 2018 in atlanta ga assessed potable water savings of small scale hybrid graywater systems that work in conjunction with the centralized system and their life cycle impacts to electricity consumption the ecosystem and human health a study conducted in cape cod ma found energy and carbon benefits for graywater reuse particularly when energy is captured from separated blackwater xue et al 2016 to date most studies conducted to compare water demand reduction strategies have been isolated to one city state or geographical region or have not included the comprehensive set of water conservation and fit for purpose water strategies one study that was conducted across different regions nrc 2016 only included analysis of beneficial use of graywater and stormwater thus comparison of a diverse set of strategies including end use efficiency and use of alternate water sources across different climate regions has not been possible costs for water demand reduction strategies have been studied nrc 2016 2012 cooley and phurisamban 2016 ladwp 2015 however studies to date have tended to focus either on demand reduction cost or carbon footprint individually rather than seeking to identify tradeoffs amongst performance in those categories there remains a lack of comparative and integrated assessment of the diverse set of strategies available to reduce demand on traditional supplies that includes consideration of efficacy of strategies across regions and tradeoffs associated with cost a one solution fits all approach for achieving water demand reduction does not exist it is important to consider a diverse portfolio of strategies that complement local climate conditions as well as the unique characteristics of a city this study applies a unique framework that couples the integrated urban water model iuwm sharvelle et al 2017a with the nsga iimultiobjective optimization approach to explore tradeoffs associated with water conservation and fit for purpose water use in three us cities located in distinct climate regions a comprehensive set of strategies are studied including end use efficiency strategies and multiple source water end use combinations the local effects of precipitation population density and land cover on strategy performance is explored 2 methods three study cities were selected across the united states representative of different climate and land development patterns section 2 1 and observed data of water use was obtained to calibrate and test the iuwm the calibrated models for each city represented the baseline current condition iuwm was then used to generate estimates of reduction of demand for traditional water sources for a set of water conservation and reuse strategies individually and in combination annualized life cycle cost of each strategy was found in the literature or estimated based on system components and operational requirements an optimization of solutions was conducted using a non dominated ranking procedure that minimizes model outputs of annual water demand and annualized total cost this approach provides a rigorous methodology for cost benefit analysis by identifying a set of non dominated solutions that lie on the pareto optimal front deb et al 2002 non dominated solutions and the strategies they are composed of were assessed using frequency analysis to identify strategies that were most frequently part of optimal solutions in each study city 2 1 study cities the three cities analyzed in this study are denver colorado miami florida and tucson arizona these cities were selected for their distinct climatic and urban land use characteristics table 1 according to the koppen climate classification system denver lies in a semi arid continental climate zone miami lies in a tropical monsoon climate zone and tucson lies in a mid latitude steppe and desert climate zone with climatic conditions as summarized in fig 1 outdoor water use in miami and tucson is year round while seasonal in denver the wide variety of characteristics in study cities enables identification of factors that may impact efficacy of water demand reduction strategies 2 2 use of iuwm to estimate water demand iuwm is a mass balance municipal water use and forecasting tool sharvelle et al 2017a that estimates residential and commercial industrial and institutional cii indoor water demand as well as outdoor demand in addition iuwm simulates indoor and outdoor water conservation strategies and has explicit capacities to evaluate the potential for use of alternate water sources i e graywater wastewater stormwater runoff and roof runoff at a range of scales single building to municipal iuwm has been demonstrated to effectively estimate indoor and outdoor water demand based on a set of defined parameters sharvelle et al 2017a for each city four years of water use data were aggregated monthly and spatially by u s census block group iuwm is a spatial model and thus it is critical that the calibrated area is accompanied with water use data that encompasses the modeled area in its entirety this analysis modeled residential indoor use and all outdoor water use from residential and non residential use for irrigation indoor commercial industrial and institutional cii water use was not included in calibration testing or simulations due to large variability in that data and uncertainty in end uses dziegielewski et al 2000 morales et al 2011 outdoor cii water use includes irrigation of parks and open spaces irrigation of all service types was included in calibration since iuwm models outdoor demand using land cover classification and does not distinguish residential from non residential areas sharvelle et al 2017a water meter data obtained from cities was sometimes incomplete having gaps in time or space each city required different approaches to ensure full coverage and each city differed slightly in the outdoor parameters that needed to be calibrated see descriptions below for each city the census block groups with full water use information were randomly divided into calibration sets 80 percent and testing sets 20 percent fig s1 this ensured spatial variation of block groups selected for each calibration and testing model parameters as described in sharvelle et al 2017a were estimated using the sobol global sensitivity analysis technique saltelli et al 2000 which comprehensively draws samples from the parameter hypercube for each parameter set a statistically correct likelihood function was estimated ahmadi et al 2014 the likelihood function assumes an auto regressive transformation of errors after transforming data by the natural logarithm the model parameters were estimated at each census block group individually across the selected areas in the calibration set moreover the model performance in training and testing was evaluated by error statistics including mean relative error mre and bias bias only parameter sets that produced mre and bias between 5 and 5 were considered mre and bias between 10 and 10 were considered acceptable for testing results the parameter set with the maximum likelihood function value was selected as the calibrated parameter set which was subsequently used to represent baseline conditions 2 2 1 denver denver water provided monthly water meter data from 2011 to 2016 across its service area in the denver metro area meter data were categorized by service agreement type and their respective location identified by us census blocks the service agreement types were combined into two categories residential and cii monthly meter data were aggregated into residential and cii categories and summed by census block group for analysis both categories were divided into indoor and outdoor use by considering the average consumption during non irrigation winter months of november through february as a proxy for indoor use throughout the year sharvelle et al 2017a cii use in summer months was obtained after removing the winter average use and added to residential outdoor use to represent total outdoor water use the modeled service area encompassed 704 block groups in the denver metro area however some block groups were eliminated due to incomplete coverage and a remaining 393 block groups were used for calibration and testing one thousand parameter sets were run in the sensitivity analysis for the outdoor parameters and three hundred for the two indoor parameters table 2 parameter values were varied within a realistic range to limit the total number of parameters calibrated assumed values were applied to some parameters when reasonable estimates could be justified net irrigation requirement met nir plant factor k i pf the minimum threshold temperature for which irrigation is applied t i irr and irrigation efficiency k i eff were assumed values and were not varied for calibration a value of 0 8 was used for k i p f a vegetation coefficient estimated for cool season grass ansai asabe 2017 which is the most common landscape in denver nir was held constant at 45 of the theoretical irrigation requirement the national average deoreo et al 2016 t i irr was held at 13 c the value determined for fort collins co sharvelle et al 2017a a value of 0 71 was assumed for k i eff based on findings from deoreo et al 2016 estimates for other parameters were from the calibration procedure calibrated parameters to estimate indoor demand α and β are based on the equation developed by deoreo et al 2016 to estimate indoor residential water demand on a per household basis for outdoor demand parameter calibration percentage of precipitation events responded to k i pcp and percentage area for each category of national landcover database land use type i e open low medium and high irrigated a i c were estimated based on error statistics calibration and testing performed well in denver table 3 2 2 2 miami individual water meter data were provided by the miami dade water utility for the years of 2012 2016 and six months of 2017 raw data were quarterly billed use amounts and were divided evenly across the number of days in each billing period then aggregated monthly the service area is composed of 502 288 m identified by a premise location id the raw data were composed of 247 premise types covering residential and cii categories this analysis aggregated all residential residential sprinkler and commercial sprinkler meters and is referred hereon as total use for the calibration process the analysis set consisted of 300 000 single family homes 140 000 apartments duplexes and townhouses 4 631 commercial sprinkler and park meters and 3 969 residential sprinkler meters of the 848 block groups in the modeled service area 387 block groups were used for calibration and testing the model there was no way to separate water use observations into indoor and outdoor uses since outdoor water use was year round in miami therefore the national average values for α and β de oreo et al 2016 were applied to estimate indoor use calibration was conducted to total water use data from february 2012 through june 2017 when calibrating to total use with set indoor α and β parameters iuwm attributes indoor demand from the parameters and number of households and calibrates the outdoor parameters to the remaining total use iuwm has the option to use daily monthly average or annual average reference evapotranspiration et0 to estimate outdoor water use based on observed data it was found that outdoor water use is not responsive to plant requirements as determined by daily nor monthly et0 and that there are not behavioral changes in outdoor water use associated with weather patterns this is consistent with observations from opalanski et al 2019 thus average annual et0 was used to estimate outdoor water use in miami similar to denver some parameter values were assumed based on literature values and others were estimated via calibration table 2 mre and bias were within 1 for calibration and 10 for testing table 3 2 2 3 tucson tucson city water utility provided monthly water use data within the tucson metro area service area for 2012 2017 raw data were provided by block group and service type irrigation service types indicated water use during the winter months block groups that did not contain residential meter data were not used in the analysis service types encompassing residential irrigation and reclaimed water for irrigation for residential and commercial were aggregated to total use for model calibration a total of 332 block groups were used to test the model and 83 for training similar to miami it was not possible to use winter months to estimate indoor use for rest of the year indoor α and β values table 2 used for tucson are those determined for scottsdale az deoreo et al 2016 to estimate outdoor water demand in tucson t i irr was changed from 13 c to 5 c table 2 while the average daily temperature drops below 13 c in winter months in tucson fig 1 the water use data indicated outdoor water use during all months of the year use of 5 c for t i irr resulted in allocation of water for outdoor use throughout the year mre and bias were within 2 for calibration and 3 for testing table 3 well within acceptable ranges for error 2 3 strategies to reduce demand for traditional supplies calibrated models for each city were used to represent a baseline condition and scenarios of water conservation and reuse strategies were developed to assess tradeoffs between cost and water demand reduction potential water demand reduction strategies included water use efficiency and use of alternate water sources to expand supplies i e fit for purpose water use end use efficiency strategies included both indoor and outdoor uses indoor water efficiency includes installation of water conserving fixtures as described in sharvelle et al 2017a outdoor water efficiency strategies assessed were use of climate appropriate landscape efficient irrigation systems and use of smart irrigation systems use of alternate water sources includes various source water end use combinations source waters assessed for meeting end use demands were defined precisely as defined in sharvelle et al 2017b stormwater precipitation runoff from rain or snowmelt events that flows over land and or impervious surfaces e g streets parking lots and rooftops sharvelle et al 2017b graywater wastewater collected from non blackwater sources such as bathroom sinks showers bathtubs clothes washers and laundry sinks sharvelle et al 2017b roof runoff precipitation from a rain or snowmelt event that is collected directly from a roof surface not subject to frequent public access sharvelle et al 2017b wastewater water collected from combined graywater and blackwater sources also referred to as sewage sharvelle et al 2017b scenario simulations included these source waters as supply to meet residential toilet flushing irrigation combined toilet flushing irrigation and potable irrigation demands potable is combined with irrigation in consideration that source water treated to potable quality would enter an existing distribution system that supplies water for both purposes the methodology and algorithms applied in the iuwm for estimation of reduction of demand for traditional supplies for each strategy is described in sharvelle et al 2017a simulations of strategies were conducted using climate data from 2004 2014 the 10 year period climate data was used to account for variability in rainfall and temperature the estimated demand for traditional supplies used for scenario analysis is an annual average over the modelled climate period 2010 2014 scenarios did not take into account future land use and population changes and were simulated based on current conditions in each city two levels of adoption were considered for each strategy medium and aggressive table 4 medium adoption was considered to be ambitious but pragmatic adoption of strategies aggressive adoption considered a higher level of adoption based on maximum feasibility accounting for challenges in implementation in existing development to simulate roof runoff the percentage of impervious area collected was assumed to be 20 to represent rooftops only large storage was assumed for stormwater collection to maximize beneficial use while regional scale stormwater supply would likely use large storage tanks located on municipal property nrc 2016 luthy et al 2019 iuwm applies a volume of storage per household sharvelle et al 2017a a storage of 3000 gal per household was identified to be an ideal storage volume in the study cities where little benefit was observed with additional volume increase data not shown 2 4 cost estimation of strategies total annualized costs for each strategy were directly obtained from literature or developed through estimation based on literature values for system components and number of systems consistent with assumed parameters table 4 total cost per unit refers to the lifetime cost of a system or strategy considering capital operations and maintenance and distribution when applicable total costs include all costs regardless of ownership because the approach is a holistic method and considers the whole cost to society depending on the strategy unit costs can be per volume used per household or per unit area table 5 detailed methodology for the cost assumptions follow in subsequent sections to estimate costs for strategies where alternate water sources are used assumptions were needed to identify the scale of application as specified under system characteristics in table 5 for each source water end use combination the most common or pragmatic scale of application was assumed graywater use for irrigation is commonly applied at the single residence scale while complexities in treatment of graywater for toilet flushing render multi residential buildings or neighborhoods more practical nrc 2016 potable use of all water sources was assumed to be centralized direct potable reuse dpr as there is not yet wide acceptance of decentralized water use systems non potable use of roof runoff is most common at a single residence scale and the storage assumptions table 4 are consistent with this scale stormwater use projects are larger scale non potable use is most common at the neighborhood to sub regional scale nrc 2016 ladwp 2015 wastewater reuse is common at a centralized scale nrc 2012 total annualized cost was attained using the uniform series net present value function where total cost refers to present value cost national center for environmental economics office of policy and epa 2010 this function is applied to strategies with estimated total costs but not for those where literature values were available for cost per volume processed all annualized total costs were calculated using a 5 discount factor to test comparative sensitivity to the discount rate all strategy annualized costs were also computed at a 6 and 7 discount factor the discount factor did not impact the relative ranking of costs for strategies data not shown and thus only the 5 discount factor was applied for costs used for analysis in optimization algorithms the uniform series net present value function is calculated by tac t c i 1 r n 1 r n 1 1 where tac is total annualized cost tc is total cost r is the discount rate and n is lifespan in years 2 4 1 indoor conservation indoor conservation ic is simulated in iuwm by applying the predefined household profile function for high efficiency new homes henh outlined in the latest residential end use study deoreo et al 2016 originally demand profile α and β for henh was found by deoreo 2011 in an analysis of new single family homes with high efficiency fixtures and appliances that meet or exceed epa watersense specifications the cost of installing a high efficiency clothes washer dishwasher two toilets and three faucet aerators was referenced from epa 2005 the cost per household tc hsd was 1 584 and subsequently multiplied by the number of households adopting based on k ic adopt to attain a total cost of implementing the strategy tc ic tc hsd k ic adopt n i hsd 2 where tc ic is total cost year of indoor conservation and n i hsd is the number of modeled households across spatial subunit i this approach assumes that all appliances in a household converting to high efficiency need to be replaced and does not account for existing high efficiency fixtures 2 4 2 irrigation efficiency efficient irrigation systems eis simulates use of high efficiency sprinkler heads and is modelled in iuwm by increasing the application efficiency k i eff in the daily irrigation depth calculation sharvelle et al 2017 from 0 7 to 0 85 the total cost of eis was estimated based on the cost of installing new high efficiency sprinkler heads to cover modeled irrigated area the modeled irrigated area a i is the sum of each nlcd category area open low medium high density multiplied by their respective calibrated percent irrigated area a i c modeled irrigated area was divided by sprinkler spray area based on sprinkler radius rs to determine number of heads n heads to replace n heads a i π r s 2 3 the average cost of a high efficiency spray sprinkler head was estimated at 5 12 epa 2016 this cost was multiplied by a factor of 1 5 to account for installation cost bringing the cost per head tc head to 7 68 aggressive adoption of eis considers the higher end of the line at 7 00 head plus same installation cost as prior average irrigated radius per spray sprinkler head was set at 12 ft tc eis 1 5 n heads tc head 4 the advanced irrigation systems ais strategy simulates the installation of weather based irrigation controllers in households with existing sprinkler systems a typical cost of these controllers was found to be 155 considering the sale price of 10 epa watersense certified systems gathered in a product search online epa 2017 an estimated installation cost of 100 per system was added to arrive at a cost per household of tc hsd of 255 for ais epa 2019 estimates watersense irrigation controllers can save a typical home around 8 800 gallons of water per year to determine number of households to adopt this strategy k ais adopt the estimated savings from ais as a percentage of annual outdoor water demand was divided by the epa estimated household savings of using irrigation controllers ais k adopt aisannualsavings g a l epaannualsavingsperhousehold g a l 5 this figure was multiplied by the number of adopting households to arrive at the total cost the total cost of ais is attained by tc ais tc hsd k ais adopt 6 2 4 3 climate appropriate landscape climate appropriate landscape is modeled in iuwm by reducing the calibrated evapotranspiration plant factor k i pf the k i pf of climate appropriate landscape has been estimated to be approximately 0 33 of evapotranspiration for turf grass sovocool 2005 a reduced k i pf applied across the modeled area simulates a combination of turf grass and climate appropriate landscape with lower plant water requirements here called the combined plant factor k i c o m b pf eq 3 the fraction of irrigated area converted to climate appropriate landscape x f for each city was determined by k i c o m b pf k i c a l i b pf 1 x f k i c a l pf x f 7 the average cost of landscape conversion to climate appropriate landscape was estimated to be 1 55 per square foot t c s q f t sovocool 2005 total cost of climate appropriate landscape tc cal was estimated by x f and the total area irrigated in each study city a i tc cal tc sqft x f a i 8 maintenance for climate appropriate landscape was not considered to be more costly than turfgrass and thus was not considered as an additional cost 2 4 4 stormwater supply with the exception of stormwater use to meet potable demand the scale assumed for stormwater use systems was neighborhood to sub regional table 4 at this scale stormwater is collected over a small to medium urban watershed and stored in a large tank or detention basin before being treated and distributed the cost of sub regional systems was investigated by ladwp 2015 sub regional or neighborhood scale tank storage and reuse project total costs ranged from 1 200 to just over 6 000 af captured depending on the complexity of the end use direct use total cost included storage pumps and piping costs projects that met toilet flushing or other indoor uses were categorized as complex direct use ladwp 2015 therefore the higher total cost attributed to complex direct use projects of 6 000 af 18 41 kgal was applied to the stormwater for toilet flushing and stormwater stormwater for irrigation toilet flushing strategies the total cost estimate for stormwater for irrigation strategy was referenced from scwc 2018 based on the median cost of projects to use stormwater for irrigation 1 070 af 3 28 kgal to simulate stormwater for irrigation stormwater quality is highly variable and would require treatment prior to supplying to a water treatment facility to reduce organic matter nutrients and pathogens hill et al 2017 a practical way to achieve the required treatment would be to use wastewater treatment infrastructure to treat stormwater hill et al 2017 this study assumed that treatment of stormwater would be similar to municipal wastewater whether treated at existing centralized facilities or newly installed decentralized treatment facilities stormwater for potable irrigation was assigned the cost of centralized wastewater treatment in each city added to the high end cost of dpr including conveyance cost 6 14 kgal raucher and tchobanoglous 2014 arriving at total costs table 5 the high end of dpr costs were assumed to be conservative account for process redundancies and controls required to ensure safe drinking water is delivered 2 4 5 roof runoff supply to simulate roof runoff collection and use a storage of 200 gal household day was assumed table 4 equivalent to four 50 gallon barrels reported cost of these systems run from 1 500 1 600 per household for both toilet flushing and irrigation nrc 2016 the k rr adopt table 4 was multiplied by the total number of household in the study area to estimate number of households hsd with roof runoff collection systems tc rr k rr adopt h s d tc hsd 9 the variable tc hsd was estimated to be 1 500 for roof runoff for irrigation a household system with ultra violet uv treatment that includes toilet flushing as an end use has a reported cost of 1 600 and was applied to toilet flushing and dual irrigation and toilet flushing end uses annual operations and maintenance cost per adopting household of 100 was added to account for replacing uv system bulb 80 and additional energy and maintenance 20 for roof runoff strategies that include toilet flushing end use the combined roof runoff for potable and irrigation strategy was treated as a stormwater collection system the cost of this strategy was estimated using the average of regional and sub regional stormwater use systems plus the cost of direct potable reuse including conveyance table 5 2 4 6 graywater supply the cost applied for graywater for irrigation is that of a single household graywater system the moderate and aggressive adoption levels considered for this study includes all household graywater for a specified end use due to the difficulty in retrofitting an existing building for separate collection of graywater nrc 2016 costs were assumed for installing graywater systems in new or re development projects a cost of 2300 per household was assumed for a graywater system that collects all graywater sources in the home to be used for irrigation nrc 2016 the number of homes installing graywater systems was estimated by k gw adopt multiplied by hsd in the study area when graywater is used for toilet flushing treatment is more extensive and this type of system is more commonly applied at the multi residential or neighborhood scale nrc 2016 hodgson 2012 estimated the cost of a multi residential graywater treatment system including sand filtration and disinfection to be 4 49 kgal annualized at 5 over a 30 year life the costs for the graywater collection and distribution system were estimated to be 30 of the capital cost cordery cotter and sharvelle 2014 so a total annualized cost of 4 62 kgal was used for the graywater for potable irrigation strategy total cost was assumed to be that of wastewater treatment with the addition of direct dpr treatment and distribution 6 14 kgal graywater treatment similar to wastewater treatment is needed before supply to a potable water treatment system hill et al 2017 2 4 7 treated wastewater supply wastewater recycling system costs are referenced in cooley and phurisamban 2016 the total cost of seven non potable reuse projects including distribution with capacities less than 10 000 acre ft per year are reported to have a median cost of 4 73 kgal of processed wastewater the annual volume of wastewater used in the study cities here was near to 10 000 acre ft distribution cost is reported to be 950 af 2 92 kgal cooley and phurisamban 2016 an additional 10 of this distribution cost was included for toilet flushing and combined toilet flushing and irrigation end uses to account for additional cost of distribution to reach individual households resulting total costs applied were 4 73 kgal for irrigation end use and 5 02 for when scenarios included toilet flushing as an end use table 5 to estimate costs for wastewater for potable irrigation a cost of 2 000 af 6 14 kgal raucher and tchobanoglous 2014 was used as previously described 2 5 identifying pareto optimal strategies tradeoffs were assessed between total cost and average annual water demand reduction for strategies assessed in this study annual water demand is defined as the average annual water demand met by the traditional water supply sources for a municipality use of alternative sources does not necessarily reduce water demand but replaces traditional water sources with other water sources i e wastewater stormwater roof runoff or graywater treated to either non potable or potable quality in this manuscript use of the term water demand reduction refers to demand for traditional water supplies the nsga ii non dominated sorting algorithm deb et al 2002 was used to identify non dominated solutions from combinations of strategies that reduce demand for traditional supplies the non dominated ranking algorithm that minimized average annual water demand and total annual cost in each study city a set of 374 combinations of up to three water demand reduction strategies were run in iuwm at the medium level of adoption table 4 an additional set of 20 strategies applied at aggressive adoption table 4 was modeled to compare with the combined strategies implemented at medium adoption aggressive adoption was only considered for individual strategies not combined the combinations consist of all single strategies viable in conjunction with each other some strategies are not practical in combination the criteria for excluding strategies from combination were stormwater supply was not combined with roof runoff supply it was assumed that for larger stormwater collection projects roof runoff would be included in stormwater collection source waters were not combined to meet toilet demand because infrastructure to supply two separately treated and supplied source waters to flush toilets is complex and not practical if wastewater is used to meet potable demand then it would not be treated separately to meet non potable demands due to extensive infrastructure requirements the first ranking solutions are non dominated and can be considered as the optimal front in succession 2nd ranking solutions are beat by at least one 1st ranking in both demand and cost 3rd ranking solutions are beat by at least two other solutions and so forth the frequency of single strategies within solutions ranking 1 3 was calculated solutions up to 3rd ranking were determined to be good solutions for their proximity to the non dominated front this allows calculation of the relative frequency of strategies taking part in a larger set of top performing solutions for each city rather than considering solely the non dominated solutions 3 results 3 1 reduction of demand for traditional supplies across study cities the estimated reduction in demand for traditional supplies of the twenty strategies varies considerably between one another and variabilities of the same strategy occur between cities as well table 6 estimated demand reduction potential for stormwater supply is large compared to other practices in particular efficacy of stormwater supply is notably higher in miami due to higher precipitation and impervious area compared to other study cities table 1 results demonstrate limited potential for demand reduction resulting from roof runoff due to low storage 200 gal household water efficiency strategies that impact outdoor water use are estimated to be more effective in denver than other cities due to the larger fraction of water used outdoors in denver compared to other cities table 1 climate appropriate landscape is estimated to be particularly effective to achieve demand reduction in denver where turf grass is the dominant form of landscape see higher k i p f compared to other cities table 2 also interesting to note is that indoor conservation reduces a higher percentage of demand in tucson and miami compared to denver this is because indoor demand is already lower in denver 104 gphd compared to estimated values in miami 132 gphd and tucson 127 gphd table 1 results generally show differences in efficacy of strategies across study cities resulting from differences in climate and water use trends behavioral and resulting from climate estimated total costs for each strategy is included table 6 and tradeoffs between costs and demand reduction are explored in subsequent sections 3 2 tradeoff analysis solutions in denver varied from minimal cost to up to near 280 annual cost per capita fig 2 non dominated 2nd and 3rd ranked solutions are highlighted standout solutions are those that provide considerable demand reduction without a steep rise in cost from the previous solution or are located just before a steep rise in cost without a considerable reduction in demand also included is the annual cost of traditional wastewater treatment applied to the wastewater volume outflow under the baseline condition characteristics of standout solutions in denver are summarized table 7 aggressive ais individually was part of the standout solutions due to its low cost but it achieves the low demand reduction compared to other strategies evaluated the 2019 cost of wastewater treatment serves as a point of reference to compare relative costs of implementing the solutions to the cost of treating wastewater with no strategies implemented fig 1 63 39 annual per capita there are many solutions that can be implemented that come at a cost equal to or lower than conventional wastewater treatment tradeoffs between demand reduction potential for solutions and cost are apparent across all three study cities with increasing cost as demand reduction potential increases fig 3 standout solutions were selected for miami and tucson using the same approach as applied for denver figs s2 and s3 where 2019 annual per capita wastewater costs were 65 21 and 75 95 respectively with the exception of aggressive adoption of efficient irrigation systems in denver other standout solutions all include three strategies combined observation of the non dominated solution fronts across the study cites indicates that trends are similar in tucson and denver but notably different in miami fig 3 the difference results from higher demand reduction potential in miami compared to tucson and denver stormwater can serve as large source of water supply in miami resulting in demand reduction much higher up to 45 than denver up to 21 or tucson up to 17 table 6 stormwater supply appears in the standout solutions in miami with highest demand reduction potential table 7 important to note is that these high demand reduction strategies also come at a high cost evaluation of frequency of individual strategies in solutions ranking 1 3 enables identification of strategies that are often part of optimal solutions fig 4 strategies that included a sole end use toilet flushing were removed from representation fig 4 as they performed approximately as well as the combined toilet flushing irrigation efficient irrigation systems and stormwater for irrigation were identified as the most cost effective strategies across the three cities fig 4 there are notable differences in frequency of strategies amongst the three study cities indoor conservation is more commonly part of non dominated solutions in tucson than denver or miami the estimated indoor water use applied in this study is higher in tucson 127 gphd table 1 than denver providing opportunity to reduce demand via installation of efficient indoor water fixtures another consideration is that lower number of houses in the study area table 1 means that the total cost for installation of indoor water efficiency fixtures is lower costs for indoor conservation were estimated based on a per household cost table 5 resulting in comparatively low total costs for the practice in tucson table 6 simulation results suggest wastewater for irrigation is more effective in miami than other study cities likely a result of high population density table 1 resulting in large wastewater production an additional consideration is that outdoor water use accounts for a lower percentage of total water use table 1 so that much of the irrigation demand can be met using alternate water sources this results in larger demand reduction potential when reported as a percent change the optimal solutions ranking 1 3 for each city were divided into three tiers 1 less than 20 2 20 40 and 3 greater than 40 per capita per year fig 5 this demonstrates the cost ranges of solutions the strategies tend to be part of strategies with high frequency can also be readily identified efficient irrigation systems is the most frequent strategy occurring in optimal solutions and appears in low medium and high cost solution scenarios fig 5 stormwater for irrigation is also frequently part of optimal solutions across the study cities however this solution does not appear in low cost solutions fig 5 this indicates that while stormwater has large potential for demand reduction table 6 it comes at a high cost indoor conservation appears more frequently in optimal solutions in tucson compared to denver and miami and is often part of low cost solution scenarios climate appropriate landscape is a strategy that is often part of optimal solutions in denver and tucson but also is only part of high cost solutions comparing graywater and wastewater to meet non potable demands toilet flushing and irrigation graywater is more frequently part of high ranked solutions and is part of low medium and high cost solutions wastewater use to meet water demand is often part of medium and high cost solutions fig 5 except for wastewater for irrigation in denver 4 discussion overall water conservation and fit for purpose approaches studied here showed large potential to reduce demand for traditional water supplies when strategies were combined demand reduction potential at the adoption rates studied here were as high as 48 in denver 58 in miami and 35 in tucson this is consistent with observations of potable water savings of 40 80 when combinations of reuse systems and conservation were implemented mitchell 2006 efficient irrigation systems were shown to be the most cost effective strategy for reducing outdoor demand such systems can reduce demand by between 7 and 9 in denver miami and tucson when improvements to irrigation system are made to achieve on average 85 efficiency table 6 in comparison between cities demand reduction estimated from efficient irrigation systems is higher in denver because outdoor demand accounts for 57 of total modeled water use a higher fraction than miami 40 and tucson 50 table 1 important to note is that observation by tucson water suggests that most household irrigation systems in tucson are not automated and so the transition to efficient irrigation systems would only be effective in parks and cii irrigated areas climate appropriate landscape is estimated to be more impactful in denver due also to the higher fraction of outdoor demand to total demand table 1 and prominence of irrigated turf grass landscape as indicated by a calibrated k i p f of 0 8 table 2 in tucson the landscape consists of native desert vegetation with some turf grass influencing a calibrated k i p f of 0 65 in comparison calibrated k i p f was 0 68 for miami climate appropriate landscape achieves high demand reductions of 22 in denver and about 12 in both miami and tucson however the strategy is expensive table 6 and part of only high cost solutions fig 5 other studies have shown negative life cycle costs associated with conversion to climate appropriate landscape cooley and phurisamban 2016 indoor conservation ic is estimated to reduce overall demand by 6 in both miami and tucson and 2 in denver table 6 the strategy is estimated to be less impactful in denver because baseline indoor use per household is already low on average table 1 and closer to the level of when high efficiency fixtures are widely adopted indoor conservation complements the effectiveness of alternative source strategies that supplement toilet flushing and potable end uses reducing potable water demand even further indoor conservation is estimated to be more effective in miami and tucson where estimated baseline or current indoor use per household is higher and there is more potential for indoor conservation of the four alternative source strategies stormwater use has the greatest potential to offset potable water demand in all three cities table 6 in the scenarios run in this study sole use of stormwater reduced demand for traditional supplies by between 10 and 20 in denver 14 45 in miami and 10 17 in tucson depending on the end use table 6 stormwater is rapidly gaining attention as an important water source in urban systems but regulatory frameworks are lacking that enable its use luthy et al 2019 there are policy issues that exist in denver with respect to water law that prohibit widescale use of stormwater to meet water demand nrc 2016 because use of stormwater can be highly effective for water demand reduction policy changes in colorado that allow use of stormwater may be beneficial stormwater can serve as substantial water supply in the three study cities even when annual precipitation is low 12 14 in on average tucson and denver when there is adequate storage 3000 gal per household used here other studies have shown potential for stormwater to serve as a substantive water source when projects are regionalized with large storage nrc 2016 however this strategy comes at a high cost strategies that make use of stormwater to meet potable and non potable demands do not appear in top ranked solutions that were characterized as low cost fig 5 stormwater for irrigation is the best performing end use for stormwater fig 5 because of a lower cost resulting from lower treatment requirements table 5 stormwater for potable irrigation closely follows stormwater for irrigation for frequency in high ranked solutions while uses that include toilet flushing were rarely part of high ranked solutions fig 4 advancements to reduce costs for stormwater storage and use are needed to enhance capacity for this source water to meet its potential for demand reduction larger demand reduction can be achieved by supply of wastewater than graywater at the medium adoption levels considered in this study table 6 however use of wastewater appears less frequently in high ranked solutions than graywater when end uses include toilet flushing and is more frequently part of medium and high cost solutions fig 5 important to consider is that wastewater for irrigation does appear in low cost solutions that are high ranked and has a lower cost assumed than wastewater for toilet flushing table 5 cooley and phurisambam 2016 also found lower costs associated with wastewater use for irrigation compared to end uses that require more extensive treatment while wastewater for irrigation does appear in high ranked solutions with a frequency between 10 and 20 graywater for irrigation rarely appears in high ranked solutions fig 5 it is when end uses include toilet flushing that graywater becomes comparable to wastewater as a source water and also appears more frequently in low cost solutions fig 5 the cost per volume of graywater supplied for toilet flushing end uses assumed in this study was lower than that for treated wastewater effluent supply to meet toilet flushing demand table 5 centralized treatment of wastewater has extensive infrastructure requirements nrc 2016 and wastewater requires more treatment than graywater to be safely used to flush toilets jahne et al 2017 the graywater treatment system assumed for graywater use for toilet flushing was simple including sand filtration and disinfection in addition it was assumed that graywater systems would only be installed in new or re development buildings or neighborhoods due to the complexity of retrofitting existing construction for separate graywater collection the assumed percentage of residences for the medium adoption scenarios was 30 table 4 to account for only implementing the practice in new or re development areas important to consider also is that decentralized multi residential neighborhood scale wastewater recycling was not considered in this study and would make for an interesting comparison in future studies in summary graywater use for toilet flushing at the multi residential neighborhood scale should be considered when alternate water sources are assessed to increase water supply reliability and resiliency other scenarios of graywater supply rarely appeared in high ranked solutions roof runoff supply strategies were found to offer minimal benefit for water demand reduction table 6 but still has a cost associated with the strategy table 6 roof runoff use rarely appeared in high ranked solutions fig 5 this is consistent with findings from nrc 2016 the authors of that study noted the benefits of roof runoff collection for education and awareness on water use and conservation important to note is that fit for purpose water strategies conducted at the single residence scale e g graywater for irrigation and roof runoff supply for all end uses rarely appeared as part of optimal strategies fig 5 indicating that fit for purpose water strategies conducted at the multi residential to municipal scale are most cost effective results from this study demonstrate that end use efficiency strategies that utilities may want to incentivize are use of efficient irrigation systems and indoor conservation because success of installation of efficient irrigation systems relies on use of automated sprinklers municipalities could consider incentive programs for customers with high outdoor water use such as golf courses and parks that use automated sprinkler systems many cities already have a large uptake in use of efficient water fixtures and there is a limit to water demand reduction potential when indoor water use is near 112 gallons per household per day deoreo 2011 limited improvements are possible via indoor water conservation while stormwater supply for irrigation is costly this strategy may be important in cities with limited water supply regulatory frameworks are needed to expand regional scale projects that use stormwater as a supply luthy et al 2019 in general policy that enables use of alternate water sources can improve water supply reliability however strategies that are implemented at a single residence scale e g roof runoff supply and graywater for irrigation were not found to be as cost effective as those at multi residential regional or municipal scales fig 5 5 conclusion this study presents a framework that couples the iuwm with nsga ii multiobjective optimization to assess tradeoffs between urban water strategies that reduce demand for traditional supplies and their associated costs cost effective water conservation and fit for purpose water strategies meeting a wide range of water demand reduction targets were identified for each of the three study cities results show discrete strategy performance in demand reduction between cities influenced by local climate land cover and population density because climate and development patterns impact efficacy of water demand reduction strategies future research should address the efficacy of strategies under uncertain future conditions the top performing strategies overall in terms of water savings and total cost were found to be efficient irrigation systems and stormwater for irrigation efficacy of conversion to efficient irrigation systems is only relevant where automated irrigation systems are the dominant practice incentive programs to encourage transition to more efficient sprinkler systems may be effective but may be most effective by targeting large outdoor water users with automated irrigation systems while use of stormwater achieves large demand reduction relative to other strategies it only occurred in high ranked solutions that were characterized by higher cost this strategy can be very effective for demand reduction but is also costly also important is that stormwater supply for irrigation and potable irrigation was found to be effective in the cities studied here when considering tradeoffs between cost and demand reduction potential while separate supply of treated stormwater for toilet flushing was not graywater use for toilet flushing at the multi residential neighborhood scale and centralized wastewater supply for irrigation appeared in top ranked solutions across all three study cities and should be considered when it is a goal to balance cost and demand reduction potential policy that enables use of alternate water sources at scales beyond single residence can increase local water supplies and be cost effective credit authorship

8588,improved understanding of the effects of strategies that reduce demand for traditional water supplies i e conservation and reuse is important to foster the transition toward resilient municipal water supply systems this study assesses water demand and cost tradeoffs among strategies in three u s cities denver co miami fl and tucson az a comprehensive set of strategies to reduce demand for traditional supplies were evaluated individually and in combination including indoor conservation fixtures irrigation efficiency climate appropriate landscape and use of alternate water sources i e graywater wastewater stormwater and roof runoff theintegrated urban water model iuwm is reconciled with the nsga iimultiobjective optimization approach to explore tradeoffs and to identify optimal solutions results demonstrate differences in the set of optimal water demand reduction strategies across the three study cities due to unique differences in climate land development patterns and water use behaviors efficient irrigation systems were highly effective across the study cities when considering cost and demand reduction tradeoffs stormwater use has large potential for demand reduction even in arid regions but is a very costly strategy when alternate water sources are considered wastewater use for irrigation and graywater use for toilet flushing at the multi residential scale offer

demand on diminishing water supplies and aging infrastructure cities are looking to new strategies to manage water strategies that reduce demand for traditional water supplies water conservation and fit for purpose water use in particular are of interest to cities to meet future water supply targets and achieve one water goals daigger et al 2019 fit for purpose water use includes treatment of alternate water sources to appropriate levels to the appropriate quality for the end use daigger et al 2019 efficient use of water to meet demand has resulted in declining water use in the us where average residential indoor use has reduced from 177 gallons per household per day in 1999 to 138 gallons per household per day from in 2016 deoreo et al 2016 however even more efficient use of water can still be achieved and many alternate water sources remain untapped decisions on which water demand reduction strategies to encourage are complex efficacy of strategies that reduce demand for traditional supplies is impacted by climate land use and population density nrc 2016 in addition costs are not well understood for implementing water reuse strategies from the building to municipal scale improved understanding of costs and benefits of water conservation and fit for purpose water use strategies is needed this includes the need to understand how those costs and benefits are impacted by local considerations water demand reduction strategies can be divided into two categories end use efficiency and use of alternate water sources to increase supply end use efficiency can be achieved for both indoor and outdoor water demand via technological advancements or behavioral changes resulting from awareness campaigns or water pricing indoor water use efficiency is often achieved by installation of low water use fixtures and appliances with the most common and effective to date being low flush toilets and high efficiency laundry machines deoreo et al 2016 outdoor water efficiency can be achieved through use of smart irrigation systems efficient sprinkler heads and irrigation systems conversion to climate appropriate landscape and behavioral changes increasing water supplies through use of alternate water sources to meet potable and non potable demand is also an attractive option the most common alternate water sources are treated wastewater graywater stormwater and roof runoff sharvelle et al 2017b these source waters can be treated to meet either potable or non potable demand depending on regulatory considerations decisions on most effective strategies to reduce demand for traditional supplies are complex and depend on the objectives of the decision wilcox and nasiri 2016 some studies have compared water demand reduction strategies beneficial use of graywater and stormwater were compared across six us cities nrc 2016 the study found that graywater serves a consistent source of water throughout the year particularly in semi arid and arid regions and concluded that large storage is needed for stormwater use systems to be effective an australian study of 15 integrated management projects across the country demonstrated successful reductions in potable water supply positive community acceptance and lower water bills mitchell 2006 the sites were small neighborhood to regional scale and included many innovative systems of stormwater graywater and wastewater as supply sites with combinations of reuse systems and conservation saw potable water savings of 40 to 80 mitchell 2006 sharvelle et al 2017a assessed the demand reduction potential of a large set of water conservation and reuse strategies in fort collins co in this study outdoor water use efficiency was found to be very effective for demand reduction amongst the strategies assessed another study conducted by cooley and phurisamban 2016 focused on water conservation and reuse strategies only in california wastewater recycling for non potable reuse was found to be less expensive than indirect potable reuse because of lower treatment requirements many of the efficiency measures and conversion to climate appropriate landscape had a negative life cycle cost meaning water savings cost over the lifetime of the measure are greater than the cost to implement some studies have gone beyond comparisons of demand reduction associated with water conservation and reuse strategies and have used life cycle assessment to compare water conservation and reuse strategies one study assessed low impact development lid technologies consisting of roof runoff for irrigation and toilet flushing xeriscaping and stormwater collection in bio retention to supply non potable water jeong et al 2016 this study was conducted for atlanta ga another lca study by jeong et al 2018 in atlanta ga assessed potable water savings of small scale hybrid graywater systems that work in conjunction with the centralized system and their life cycle impacts to electricity consumption the ecosystem and human health a study conducted in cape cod ma found energy and carbon benefits for graywater reuse particularly when energy is captured from separated blackwater xue et al 2016 to date most studies conducted to compare water demand reduction strategies have been isolated to one city state or geographical region or have not included the comprehensive set of water conservation and fit for purpose water strategies one study that was conducted across different regions nrc 2016 only included analysis of beneficial use of graywater and stormwater thus comparison of a diverse set of strategies including end use efficiency and use of alternate water sources across different climate regions has not been possible costs for water demand reduction strategies have been studied nrc 2016 2012 cooley and phurisamban 2016 ladwp 2015 however studies to date have tended to focus either on demand reduction cost or carbon footprint individually rather than seeking to identify tradeoffs amongst performance in those categories there remains a lack of comparative and integrated assessment of the diverse set of strategies available to reduce demand on traditional supplies that includes consideration of efficacy of strategies across regions and tradeoffs associated with cost a one solution fits all approach for achieving water demand reduction does not exist it is important to consider a diverse portfolio of strategies that complement local climate conditions as well as the unique characteristics of a city this study applies a unique framework that couples the integrated urban water model iuwm sharvelle et al 2017a with the nsga iimultiobjective optimization approach to explore tradeoffs associated with water conservation and fit for purpose water use in three us cities located in distinct climate regions a comprehensive set of strategies are studied including end use efficiency strategies and multiple source water end use combinations the local effects of precipitation population density and land cover on strategy performance is explored 2 methods three study cities were selected across the united states representative of different climate and land development patterns section 2 1 and observed data of water use was obtained to calibrate and test the iuwm the calibrated models for each city represented the baseline current condition iuwm was then used to generate estimates of reduction of demand for traditional water sources for a set of water conservation and reuse strategies individually and in combination annualized life cycle cost of each strategy was found in the literature or estimated based on system components and operational requirements an optimization of solutions was conducted using a non dominated ranking procedure that minimizes model outputs of annual water demand and annualized total cost this approach provides a rigorous methodology for cost benefit analysis by identifying a set of non dominated solutions that lie on the pareto optimal front deb et al 2002 non dominated solutions and the strategies they are composed of were assessed using frequency analysis to identify strategies that were most frequently part of optimal solutions in each study city 2 1 study cities the three cities analyzed in this study are denver colorado miami florida and tucson arizona these cities were selected for their distinct climatic and urban land use characteristics table 1 according to the koppen climate classification system denver lies in a semi arid continental climate zone miami lies in a tropical monsoon climate zone and tucson lies in a mid latitude steppe and desert climate zone with climatic conditions as summarized in fig 1 outdoor water use in miami and tucson is year round while seasonal in denver the wide variety of characteristics in study cities enables identification of factors that may impact efficacy of water demand reduction strategies 2 2 use of iuwm to estimate water demand iuwm is a mass balance municipal water use and forecasting tool sharvelle et al 2017a that estimates residential and commercial industrial and institutional cii indoor water demand as well as outdoor demand in addition iuwm simulates indoor and outdoor water conservation strategies and has explicit capacities to evaluate the potential for use of alternate water sources i e graywater wastewater stormwater runoff and roof runoff at a range of scales single building to municipal iuwm has been demonstrated to effectively estimate indoor and outdoor water demand based on a set of defined parameters sharvelle et al 2017a for each city four years of water use data were aggregated monthly and spatially by u s census block group iuwm is a spatial model and thus it is critical that the calibrated area is accompanied with water use data that encompasses the modeled area in its entirety this analysis modeled residential indoor use and all outdoor water use from residential and non residential use for irrigation indoor commercial industrial and institutional cii water use was not included in calibration testing or simulations due to large variability in that data and uncertainty in end uses dziegielewski et al 2000 morales et al 2011 outdoor cii water use includes irrigation of parks and open spaces irrigation of all service types was included in calibration since iuwm models outdoor demand using land cover classification and does not distinguish residential from non residential areas sharvelle et al 2017a water meter data obtained from cities was sometimes incomplete having gaps in time or space each city required different approaches to ensure full coverage and each city differed slightly in the outdoor parameters that needed to be calibrated see descriptions below for each city the census block groups with full water use information were randomly divided into calibration sets 80 percent and testing sets 20 percent fig s1 this ensured spatial variation of block groups selected for each calibration and testing model parameters as described in sharvelle et al 2017a were estimated using the sobol global sensitivity analysis technique saltelli et al 2000 which comprehensively draws samples from the parameter hypercube for each parameter set a statistically correct likelihood function was estimated ahmadi et al 2014 the likelihood function assumes an auto regressive transformation of errors after transforming data by the natural logarithm the model parameters were estimated at each census block group individually across the selected areas in the calibration set moreover the model performance in training and testing was evaluated by error statistics including mean relative error mre and bias bias only parameter sets that produced mre and bias between 5 and 5 were considered mre and bias between 10 and 10 were considered acceptable for testing results the parameter set with the maximum likelihood function value was selected as the calibrated parameter set which was subsequently used to represent baseline conditions 2 2 1 denver denver water provided monthly water meter data from 2011 to 2016 across its service area in the denver metro area meter data were categorized by service agreement type and their respective location identified by us census blocks the service agreement types were combined into two categories residential and cii monthly meter data were aggregated into residential and cii categories and summed by census block group for analysis both categories were divided into indoor and outdoor use by considering the average consumption during non irrigation winter months of november through february as a proxy for indoor use throughout the year sharvelle et al 2017a cii use in summer months was obtained after removing the winter average use and added to residential outdoor use to represent total outdoor water use the modeled service area encompassed 704 block groups in the denver metro area however some block groups were eliminated due to incomplete coverage and a remaining 393 block groups were used for calibration and testing one thousand parameter sets were run in the sensitivity analysis for the outdoor parameters and three hundred for the two indoor parameters table 2 parameter values were varied within a realistic range to limit the total number of parameters calibrated assumed values were applied to some parameters when reasonable estimates could be justified net irrigation requirement met nir plant factor k i pf the minimum threshold temperature for which irrigation is applied t i irr and irrigation efficiency k i eff were assumed values and were not varied for calibration a value of 0 8 was used for k i p f a vegetation coefficient estimated for cool season grass ansai asabe 2017 which is the most common landscape in denver nir was held constant at 45 of the theoretical irrigation requirement the national average deoreo et al 2016 t i irr was held at 13 c the value determined for fort collins co sharvelle et al 2017a a value of 0 71 was assumed for k i eff based on findings from deoreo et al 2016 estimates for other parameters were from the calibration procedure calibrated parameters to estimate indoor demand α and β are based on the equation developed by deoreo et al 2016 to estimate indoor residential water demand on a per household basis for outdoor demand parameter calibration percentage of precipitation events responded to k i pcp and percentage area for each category of national landcover database land use type i e open low medium and high irrigated a i c were estimated based on error statistics calibration and testing performed well in denver table 3 2 2 2 miami individual water meter data were provided by the miami dade water utility for the years of 2012 2016 and six months of 2017 raw data were quarterly billed use amounts and were divided evenly across the number of days in each billing period then aggregated monthly the service area is composed of 502 288 m identified by a premise location id the raw data were composed of 247 premise types covering residential and cii categories this analysis aggregated all residential residential sprinkler and commercial sprinkler meters and is referred hereon as total use for the calibration process the analysis set consisted of 300 000 single family homes 140 000 apartments duplexes and townhouses 4 631 commercial sprinkler and park meters and 3 969 residential sprinkler meters of the 848 block groups in the modeled service area 387 block groups were used for calibration and testing the model there was no way to separate water use observations into indoor and outdoor uses since outdoor water use was year round in miami therefore the national average values for α and β de oreo et al 2016 were applied to estimate indoor use calibration was conducted to total water use data from february 2012 through june 2017 when calibrating to total use with set indoor α and β parameters iuwm attributes indoor demand from the parameters and number of households and calibrates the outdoor parameters to the remaining total use iuwm has the option to use daily monthly average or annual average reference evapotranspiration et0 to estimate outdoor water use based on observed data it was found that outdoor water use is not responsive to plant requirements as determined by daily nor monthly et0 and that there are not behavioral changes in outdoor water use associated with weather patterns this is consistent with observations from opalanski et al 2019 thus average annual et0 was used to estimate outdoor water use in miami similar to denver some parameter values were assumed based on literature values and others were estimated via calibration table 2 mre and bias were within 1 for calibration and 10 for testing table 3 2 2 3 tucson tucson city water utility provided monthly water use data within the tucson metro area service area for 2012 2017 raw data were provided by block group and service type irrigation service types indicated water use during the winter months block groups that did not contain residential meter data were not used in the analysis service types encompassing residential irrigation and reclaimed water for irrigation for residential and commercial were aggregated to total use for model calibration a total of 332 block groups were used to test the model and 83 for training similar to miami it was not possible to use winter months to estimate indoor use for rest of the year indoor α and β values table 2 used for tucson are those determined for scottsdale az deoreo et al 2016 to estimate outdoor water demand in tucson t i irr was changed from 13 c to 5 c table 2 while the average daily temperature drops below 13 c in winter months in tucson fig 1 the water use data indicated outdoor water use during all months of the year use of 5 c for t i irr resulted in allocation of water for outdoor use throughout the year mre and bias were within 2 for calibration and 3 for testing table 3 well within acceptable ranges for error 2 3 strategies to reduce demand for traditional supplies calibrated models for each city were used to represent a baseline condition and scenarios of water conservation and reuse strategies were developed to assess tradeoffs between cost and water demand reduction potential water demand reduction strategies included water use efficiency and use of alternate water sources to expand supplies i e fit for purpose water use end use efficiency strategies included both indoor and outdoor uses indoor water efficiency includes installation of water conserving fixtures as described in sharvelle et al 2017a outdoor water efficiency strategies assessed were use of climate appropriate landscape efficient irrigation systems and use of smart irrigation systems use of alternate water sources includes various source water end use combinations source waters assessed for meeting end use demands were defined precisely as defined in sharvelle et al 2017b stormwater precipitation runoff from rain or snowmelt events that flows over land and or impervious surfaces e g streets parking lots and rooftops sharvelle et al 2017b graywater wastewater collected from non blackwater sources such as bathroom sinks showers bathtubs clothes washers and laundry sinks sharvelle et al 2017b roof runoff precipitation from a rain or snowmelt event that is collected directly from a roof surface not subject to frequent public access sharvelle et al 2017b wastewater water collected from combined graywater and blackwater sources also referred to as sewage sharvelle et al 2017b scenario simulations included these source waters as supply to meet residential toilet flushing irrigation combined toilet flushing irrigation and potable irrigation demands potable is combined with irrigation in consideration that source water treated to potable quality would enter an existing distribution system that supplies water for both purposes the methodology and algorithms applied in the iuwm for estimation of reduction of demand for traditional supplies for each strategy is described in sharvelle et al 2017a simulations of strategies were conducted using climate data from 2004 2014 the 10 year period climate data was used to account for variability in rainfall and temperature the estimated demand for traditional supplies used for scenario analysis is an annual average over the modelled climate period 2010 2014 scenarios did not take into account future land use and population changes and were simulated based on current conditions in each city two levels of adoption were considered for each strategy medium and aggressive table 4 medium adoption was considered to be ambitious but pragmatic adoption of strategies aggressive adoption considered a higher level of adoption based on maximum feasibility accounting for challenges in implementation in existing development to simulate roof runoff the percentage of impervious area collected was assumed to be 20 to represent rooftops only large storage was assumed for stormwater collection to maximize beneficial use while regional scale stormwater supply would likely use large storage tanks located on municipal property nrc 2016 luthy et al 2019 iuwm applies a volume of storage per household sharvelle et al 2017a a storage of 3000 gal per household was identified to be an ideal storage volume in the study cities where little benefit was observed with additional volume increase data not shown 2 4 cost estimation of strategies total annualized costs for each strategy were directly obtained from literature or developed through estimation based on literature values for system components and number of systems consistent with assumed parameters table 4 total cost per unit refers to the lifetime cost of a system or strategy considering capital operations and maintenance and distribution when applicable total costs include all costs regardless of ownership because the approach is a holistic method and considers the whole cost to society depending on the strategy unit costs can be per volume used per household or per unit area table 5 detailed methodology for the cost assumptions follow in subsequent sections to estimate costs for strategies where alternate water sources are used assumptions were needed to identify the scale of application as specified under system characteristics in table 5 for each source water end use combination the most common or pragmatic scale of application was assumed graywater use for irrigation is commonly applied at the single residence scale while complexities in treatment of graywater for toilet flushing render multi residential buildings or neighborhoods more practical nrc 2016 potable use of all water sources was assumed to be centralized direct potable reuse dpr as there is not yet wide acceptance of decentralized water use systems non potable use of roof runoff is most common at a single residence scale and the storage assumptions table 4 are consistent with this scale stormwater use projects are larger scale non potable use is most common at the neighborhood to sub regional scale nrc 2016 ladwp 2015 wastewater reuse is common at a centralized scale nrc 2012 total annualized cost was attained using the uniform series net present value function where total cost refers to present value cost national center for environmental economics office of policy and epa 2010 this function is applied to strategies with estimated total costs but not for those where literature values were available for cost per volume processed all annualized total costs were calculated using a 5 discount factor to test comparative sensitivity to the discount rate all strategy annualized costs were also computed at a 6 and 7 discount factor the discount factor did not impact the relative ranking of costs for strategies data not shown and thus only the 5 discount factor was applied for costs used for analysis in optimization algorithms the uniform series net present value function is calculated by tac t c i 1 r n 1 r n 1 1 where tac is total annualized cost tc is total cost r is the discount rate and n is lifespan in years 2 4 1 indoor conservation indoor conservation ic is simulated in iuwm by applying the predefined household profile function for high efficiency new homes henh outlined in the latest residential end use study deoreo et al 2016 originally demand profile α and β for henh was found by deoreo 2011 in an analysis of new single family homes with high efficiency fixtures and appliances that meet or exceed epa watersense specifications the cost of installing a high efficiency clothes washer dishwasher two toilets and three faucet aerators was referenced from epa 2005 the cost per household tc hsd was 1 584 and subsequently multiplied by the number of households adopting based on k ic adopt to attain a total cost of implementing the strategy tc ic tc hsd k ic adopt n i hsd 2 where tc ic is total cost year of indoor conservation and n i hsd is the number of modeled households across spatial subunit i this approach assumes that all appliances in a household converting to high efficiency need to be replaced and does not account for existing high efficiency fixtures 2 4 2 irrigation efficiency efficient irrigation systems eis simulates use of high efficiency sprinkler heads and is modelled in iuwm by increasing the application efficiency k i eff in the daily irrigation depth calculation sharvelle et al 2017 from 0 7 to 0 85 the total cost of eis was estimated based on the cost of installing new high efficiency sprinkler heads to cover modeled irrigated area the modeled irrigated area a i is the sum of each nlcd category area open low medium high density multiplied by their respective calibrated percent irrigated area a i c modeled irrigated area was divided by sprinkler spray area based on sprinkler radius rs to determine number of heads n heads to replace n heads a i π r s 2 3 the average cost of a high efficiency spray sprinkler head was estimated at 5 12 epa 2016 this cost was multiplied by a factor of 1 5 to account for installation cost bringing the cost per head tc head to 7 68 aggressive adoption of eis considers the higher end of the line at 7 00 head plus same installation cost as prior average irrigated radius per spray sprinkler head was set at 12 ft tc eis 1 5 n heads tc head 4 the advanced irrigation systems ais strategy simulates the installation of weather based irrigation controllers in households with existing sprinkler systems a typical cost of these controllers was found to be 155 considering the sale price of 10 epa watersense certified systems gathered in a product search online epa 2017 an estimated installation cost of 100 per system was added to arrive at a cost per household of tc hsd of 255 for ais epa 2019 estimates watersense irrigation controllers can save a typical home around 8 800 gallons of water per year to determine number of households to adopt this strategy k ais adopt the estimated savings from ais as a percentage of annual outdoor water demand was divided by the epa estimated household savings of using irrigation controllers ais k adopt aisannualsavings g a l epaannualsavingsperhousehold g a l 5 this figure was multiplied by the number of adopting households to arrive at the total cost the total cost of ais is attained by tc ais tc hsd k ais adopt 6 2 4 3 climate appropriate landscape climate appropriate landscape is modeled in iuwm by reducing the calibrated evapotranspiration plant factor k i pf the k i pf of climate appropriate landscape has been estimated to be approximately 0 33 of evapotranspiration for turf grass sovocool 2005 a reduced k i pf applied across the modeled area simulates a combination of turf grass and climate appropriate landscape with lower plant water requirements here called the combined plant factor k i c o m b pf eq 3 the fraction of irrigated area converted to climate appropriate landscape x f for each city was determined by k i c o m b pf k i c a l i b pf 1 x f k i c a l pf x f 7 the average cost of landscape conversion to climate appropriate landscape was estimated to be 1 55 per square foot t c s q f t sovocool 2005 total cost of climate appropriate landscape tc cal was estimated by x f and the total area irrigated in each study city a i tc cal tc sqft x f a i 8 maintenance for climate appropriate landscape was not considered to be more costly than turfgrass and thus was not considered as an additional cost 2 4 4 stormwater supply with the exception of stormwater use to meet potable demand the scale assumed for stormwater use systems was neighborhood to sub regional table 4 at this scale stormwater is collected over a small to medium urban watershed and stored in a large tank or detention basin before being treated and distributed the cost of sub regional systems was investigated by ladwp 2015 sub regional or neighborhood scale tank storage and reuse project total costs ranged from 1 200 to just over 6 000 af captured depending on the complexity of the end use direct use total cost included storage pumps and piping costs projects that met toilet flushing or other indoor uses were categorized as complex direct use ladwp 2015 therefore the higher total cost attributed to complex direct use projects of 6 000 af 18 41 kgal was applied to the stormwater for toilet flushing and stormwater stormwater for irrigation toilet flushing strategies the total cost estimate for stormwater for irrigation strategy was referenced from scwc 2018 based on the median cost of projects to use stormwater for irrigation 1 070 af 3 28 kgal to simulate stormwater for irrigation stormwater quality is highly variable and would require treatment prior to supplying to a water treatment facility to reduce organic matter nutrients and pathogens hill et al 2017 a practical way to achieve the required treatment would be to use wastewater treatment infrastructure to treat stormwater hill et al 2017 this study assumed that treatment of stormwater would be similar to municipal wastewater whether treated at existing centralized facilities or newly installed decentralized treatment facilities stormwater for potable irrigation was assigned the cost of centralized wastewater treatment in each city added to the high end cost of dpr including conveyance cost 6 14 kgal raucher and tchobanoglous 2014 arriving at total costs table 5 the high end of dpr costs were assumed to be conservative account for process redundancies and controls required to ensure safe drinking water is delivered 2 4 5 roof runoff supply to simulate roof runoff collection and use a storage of 200 gal household day was assumed table 4 equivalent to four 50 gallon barrels reported cost of these systems run from 1 500 1 600 per household for both toilet flushing and irrigation nrc 2016 the k rr adopt table 4 was multiplied by the total number of household in the study area to estimate number of households hsd with roof runoff collection systems tc rr k rr adopt h s d tc hsd 9 the variable tc hsd was estimated to be 1 500 for roof runoff for irrigation a household system with ultra violet uv treatment that includes toilet flushing as an end use has a reported cost of 1 600 and was applied to toilet flushing and dual irrigation and toilet flushing end uses annual operations and maintenance cost per adopting household of 100 was added to account for replacing uv system bulb 80 and additional energy and maintenance 20 for roof runoff strategies that include toilet flushing end use the combined roof runoff for potable and irrigation strategy was treated as a stormwater collection system the cost of this strategy was estimated using the average of regional and sub regional stormwater use systems plus the cost of direct potable reuse including conveyance table 5 2 4 6 graywater supply the cost applied for graywater for irrigation is that of a single household graywater system the moderate and aggressive adoption levels considered for this study includes all household graywater for a specified end use due to the difficulty in retrofitting an existing building for separate collection of graywater nrc 2016 costs were assumed for installing graywater systems in new or re development projects a cost of 2300 per household was assumed for a graywater system that collects all graywater sources in the home to be used for irrigation nrc 2016 the number of homes installing graywater systems was estimated by k gw adopt multiplied by hsd in the study area when graywater is used for toilet flushing treatment is more extensive and this type of system is more commonly applied at the multi residential or neighborhood scale nrc 2016 hodgson 2012 estimated the cost of a multi residential graywater treatment system including sand filtration and disinfection to be 4 49 kgal annualized at 5 over a 30 year life the costs for the graywater collection and distribution system were estimated to be 30 of the capital cost cordery cotter and sharvelle 2014 so a total annualized cost of 4 62 kgal was used for the graywater for potable irrigation strategy total cost was assumed to be that of wastewater treatment with the addition of direct dpr treatment and distribution 6 14 kgal graywater treatment similar to wastewater treatment is needed before supply to a potable water treatment system hill et al 2017 2 4 7 treated wastewater supply wastewater recycling system costs are referenced in cooley and phurisamban 2016 the total cost of seven non potable reuse projects including distribution with capacities less than 10 000 acre ft per year are reported to have a median cost of 4 73 kgal of processed wastewater the annual volume of wastewater used in the study cities here was near to 10 000 acre ft distribution cost is reported to be 950 af 2 92 kgal cooley and phurisamban 2016 an additional 10 of this distribution cost was included for toilet flushing and combined toilet flushing and irrigation end uses to account for additional cost of distribution to reach individual households resulting total costs applied were 4 73 kgal for irrigation end use and 5 02 for when scenarios included toilet flushing as an end use table 5 to estimate costs for wastewater for potable irrigation a cost of 2 000 af 6 14 kgal raucher and tchobanoglous 2014 was used as previously described 2 5 identifying pareto optimal strategies tradeoffs were assessed between total cost and average annual water demand reduction for strategies assessed in this study annual water demand is defined as the average annual water demand met by the traditional water supply sources for a municipality use of alternative sources does not necessarily reduce water demand but replaces traditional water sources with other water sources i e wastewater stormwater roof runoff or graywater treated to either non potable or potable quality in this manuscript use of the term water demand reduction refers to demand for traditional water supplies the nsga ii non dominated sorting algorithm deb et al 2002 was used to identify non dominated solutions from combinations of strategies that reduce demand for traditional supplies the non dominated ranking algorithm that minimized average annual water demand and total annual cost in each study city a set of 374 combinations of up to three water demand reduction strategies were run in iuwm at the medium level of adoption table 4 an additional set of 20 strategies applied at aggressive adoption table 4 was modeled to compare with the combined strategies implemented at medium adoption aggressive adoption was only considered for individual strategies not combined the combinations consist of all single strategies viable in conjunction with each other some strategies are not practical in combination the criteria for excluding strategies from combination were stormwater supply was not combined with roof runoff supply it was assumed that for larger stormwater collection projects roof runoff would be included in stormwater collection source waters were not combined to meet toilet demand because infrastructure to supply two separately treated and supplied source waters to flush toilets is complex and not practical if wastewater is used to meet potable demand then it would not be treated separately to meet non potable demands due to extensive infrastructure requirements the first ranking solutions are non dominated and can be considered as the optimal front in succession 2nd ranking solutions are beat by at least one 1st ranking in both demand and cost 3rd ranking solutions are beat by at least two other solutions and so forth the frequency of single strategies within solutions ranking 1 3 was calculated solutions up to 3rd ranking were determined to be good solutions for their proximity to the non dominated front this allows calculation of the relative frequency of strategies taking part in a larger set of top performing solutions for each city rather than considering solely the non dominated solutions 3 results 3 1 reduction of demand for traditional supplies across study cities the estimated reduction in demand for traditional supplies of the twenty strategies varies considerably between one another and variabilities of the same strategy occur between cities as well table 6 estimated demand reduction potential for stormwater supply is large compared to other practices in particular efficacy of stormwater supply is notably higher in miami due to higher precipitation and impervious area compared to other study cities table 1 results demonstrate limited potential for demand reduction resulting from roof runoff due to low storage 200 gal household water efficiency strategies that impact outdoor water use are estimated to be more effective in denver than other cities due to the larger fraction of water used outdoors in denver compared to other cities table 1 climate appropriate landscape is estimated to be particularly effective to achieve demand reduction in denver where turf grass is the dominant form of landscape see higher k i p f compared to other cities table 2 also interesting to note is that indoor conservation reduces a higher percentage of demand in tucson and miami compared to denver this is because indoor demand is already lower in denver 104 gphd compared to estimated values in miami 132 gphd and tucson 127 gphd table 1 results generally show differences in efficacy of strategies across study cities resulting from differences in climate and water use trends behavioral and resulting from climate estimated total costs for each strategy is included table 6 and tradeoffs between costs and demand reduction are explored in subsequent sections 3 2 tradeoff analysis solutions in denver varied from minimal cost to up to near 280 annual cost per capita fig 2 non dominated 2nd and 3rd ranked solutions are highlighted standout solutions are those that provide considerable demand reduction without a steep rise in cost from the previous solution or are located just before a steep rise in cost without a considerable reduction in demand also included is the annual cost of traditional wastewater treatment applied to the wastewater volume outflow under the baseline condition characteristics of standout solutions in denver are summarized table 7 aggressive ais individually was part of the standout solutions due to its low cost but it achieves the low demand reduction compared to other strategies evaluated the 2019 cost of wastewater treatment serves as a point of reference to compare relative costs of implementing the solutions to the cost of treating wastewater with no strategies implemented fig 1 63 39 annual per capita there are many solutions that can be implemented that come at a cost equal to or lower than conventional wastewater treatment tradeoffs between demand reduction potential for solutions and cost are apparent across all three study cities with increasing cost as demand reduction potential increases fig 3 standout solutions were selected for miami and tucson using the same approach as applied for denver figs s2 and s3 where 2019 annual per capita wastewater costs were 65 21 and 75 95 respectively with the exception of aggressive adoption of efficient irrigation systems in denver other standout solutions all include three strategies combined observation of the non dominated solution fronts across the study cites indicates that trends are similar in tucson and denver but notably different in miami fig 3 the difference results from higher demand reduction potential in miami compared to tucson and denver stormwater can serve as large source of water supply in miami resulting in demand reduction much higher up to 45 than denver up to 21 or tucson up to 17 table 6 stormwater supply appears in the standout solutions in miami with highest demand reduction potential table 7 important to note is that these high demand reduction strategies also come at a high cost evaluation of frequency of individual strategies in solutions ranking 1 3 enables identification of strategies that are often part of optimal solutions fig 4 strategies that included a sole end use toilet flushing were removed from representation fig 4 as they performed approximately as well as the combined toilet flushing irrigation efficient irrigation systems and stormwater for irrigation were identified as the most cost effective strategies across the three cities fig 4 there are notable differences in frequency of strategies amongst the three study cities indoor conservation is more commonly part of non dominated solutions in tucson than denver or miami the estimated indoor water use applied in this study is higher in tucson 127 gphd table 1 than denver providing opportunity to reduce demand via installation of efficient indoor water fixtures another consideration is that lower number of houses in the study area table 1 means that the total cost for installation of indoor water efficiency fixtures is lower costs for indoor conservation were estimated based on a per household cost table 5 resulting in comparatively low total costs for the practice in tucson table 6 simulation results suggest wastewater for irrigation is more effective in miami than other study cities likely a result of high population density table 1 resulting in large wastewater production an additional consideration is that outdoor water use accounts for a lower percentage of total water use table 1 so that much of the irrigation demand can be met using alternate water sources this results in larger demand reduction potential when reported as a percent change the optimal solutions ranking 1 3 for each city were divided into three tiers 1 less than 20 2 20 40 and 3 greater than 40 per capita per year fig 5 this demonstrates the cost ranges of solutions the strategies tend to be part of strategies with high frequency can also be readily identified efficient irrigation systems is the most frequent strategy occurring in optimal solutions and appears in low medium and high cost solution scenarios fig 5 stormwater for irrigation is also frequently part of optimal solutions across the study cities however this solution does not appear in low cost solutions fig 5 this indicates that while stormwater has large potential for demand reduction table 6 it comes at a high cost indoor conservation appears more frequently in optimal solutions in tucson compared to denver and miami and is often part of low cost solution scenarios climate appropriate landscape is a strategy that is often part of optimal solutions in denver and tucson but also is only part of high cost solutions comparing graywater and wastewater to meet non potable demands toilet flushing and irrigation graywater is more frequently part of high ranked solutions and is part of low medium and high cost solutions wastewater use to meet water demand is often part of medium and high cost solutions fig 5 except for wastewater for irrigation in denver 4 discussion overall water conservation and fit for purpose approaches studied here showed large potential to reduce demand for traditional water supplies when strategies were combined demand reduction potential at the adoption rates studied here were as high as 48 in denver 58 in miami and 35 in tucson this is consistent with observations of potable water savings of 40 80 when combinations of reuse systems and conservation were implemented mitchell 2006 efficient irrigation systems were shown to be the most cost effective strategy for reducing outdoor demand such systems can reduce demand by between 7 and 9 in denver miami and tucson when improvements to irrigation system are made to achieve on average 85 efficiency table 6 in comparison between cities demand reduction estimated from efficient irrigation systems is higher in denver because outdoor demand accounts for 57 of total modeled water use a higher fraction than miami 40 and tucson 50 table 1 important to note is that observation by tucson water suggests that most household irrigation systems in tucson are not automated and so the transition to efficient irrigation systems would only be effective in parks and cii irrigated areas climate appropriate landscape is estimated to be more impactful in denver due also to the higher fraction of outdoor demand to total demand table 1 and prominence of irrigated turf grass landscape as indicated by a calibrated k i p f of 0 8 table 2 in tucson the landscape consists of native desert vegetation with some turf grass influencing a calibrated k i p f of 0 65 in comparison calibrated k i p f was 0 68 for miami climate appropriate landscape achieves high demand reductions of 22 in denver and about 12 in both miami and tucson however the strategy is expensive table 6 and part of only high cost solutions fig 5 other studies have shown negative life cycle costs associated with conversion to climate appropriate landscape cooley and phurisamban 2016 indoor conservation ic is estimated to reduce overall demand by 6 in both miami and tucson and 2 in denver table 6 the strategy is estimated to be less impactful in denver because baseline indoor use per household is already low on average table 1 and closer to the level of when high efficiency fixtures are widely adopted indoor conservation complements the effectiveness of alternative source strategies that supplement toilet flushing and potable end uses reducing potable water demand even further indoor conservation is estimated to be more effective in miami and tucson where estimated baseline or current indoor use per household is higher and there is more potential for indoor conservation of the four alternative source strategies stormwater use has the greatest potential to offset potable water demand in all three cities table 6 in the scenarios run in this study sole use of stormwater reduced demand for traditional supplies by between 10 and 20 in denver 14 45 in miami and 10 17 in tucson depending on the end use table 6 stormwater is rapidly gaining attention as an important water source in urban systems but regulatory frameworks are lacking that enable its use luthy et al 2019 there are policy issues that exist in denver with respect to water law that prohibit widescale use of stormwater to meet water demand nrc 2016 because use of stormwater can be highly effective for water demand reduction policy changes in colorado that allow use of stormwater may be beneficial stormwater can serve as substantial water supply in the three study cities even when annual precipitation is low 12 14 in on average tucson and denver when there is adequate storage 3000 gal per household used here other studies have shown potential for stormwater to serve as a substantive water source when projects are regionalized with large storage nrc 2016 however this strategy comes at a high cost strategies that make use of stormwater to meet potable and non potable demands do not appear in top ranked solutions that were characterized as low cost fig 5 stormwater for irrigation is the best performing end use for stormwater fig 5 because of a lower cost resulting from lower treatment requirements table 5 stormwater for potable irrigation closely follows stormwater for irrigation for frequency in high ranked solutions while uses that include toilet flushing were rarely part of high ranked solutions fig 4 advancements to reduce costs for stormwater storage and use are needed to enhance capacity for this source water to meet its potential for demand reduction larger demand reduction can be achieved by supply of wastewater than graywater at the medium adoption levels considered in this study table 6 however use of wastewater appears less frequently in high ranked solutions than graywater when end uses include toilet flushing and is more frequently part of medium and high cost solutions fig 5 important to consider is that wastewater for irrigation does appear in low cost solutions that are high ranked and has a lower cost assumed than wastewater for toilet flushing table 5 cooley and phurisambam 2016 also found lower costs associated with wastewater use for irrigation compared to end uses that require more extensive treatment while wastewater for irrigation does appear in high ranked solutions with a frequency between 10 and 20 graywater for irrigation rarely appears in high ranked solutions fig 5 it is when end uses include toilet flushing that graywater becomes comparable to wastewater as a source water and also appears more frequently in low cost solutions fig 5 the cost per volume of graywater supplied for toilet flushing end uses assumed in this study was lower than that for treated wastewater effluent supply to meet toilet flushing demand table 5 centralized treatment of wastewater has extensive infrastructure requirements nrc 2016 and wastewater requires more treatment than graywater to be safely used to flush toilets jahne et al 2017 the graywater treatment system assumed for graywater use for toilet flushing was simple including sand filtration and disinfection in addition it was assumed that graywater systems would only be installed in new or re development buildings or neighborhoods due to the complexity of retrofitting existing construction for separate graywater collection the assumed percentage of residences for the medium adoption scenarios was 30 table 4 to account for only implementing the practice in new or re development areas important to consider also is that decentralized multi residential neighborhood scale wastewater recycling was not considered in this study and would make for an interesting comparison in future studies in summary graywater use for toilet flushing at the multi residential neighborhood scale should be considered when alternate water sources are assessed to increase water supply reliability and resiliency other scenarios of graywater supply rarely appeared in high ranked solutions roof runoff supply strategies were found to offer minimal benefit for water demand reduction table 6 but still has a cost associated with the strategy table 6 roof runoff use rarely appeared in high ranked solutions fig 5 this is consistent with findings from nrc 2016 the authors of that study noted the benefits of roof runoff collection for education and awareness on water use and conservation important to note is that fit for purpose water strategies conducted at the single residence scale e g graywater for irrigation and roof runoff supply for all end uses rarely appeared as part of optimal strategies fig 5 indicating that fit for purpose water strategies conducted at the multi residential to municipal scale are most cost effective results from this study demonstrate that end use efficiency strategies that utilities may want to incentivize are use of efficient irrigation systems and indoor conservation because success of installation of efficient irrigation systems relies on use of automated sprinklers municipalities could consider incentive programs for customers with high outdoor water use such as golf courses and parks that use automated sprinkler systems many cities already have a large uptake in use of efficient water fixtures and there is a limit to water demand reduction potential when indoor water use is near 112 gallons per household per day deoreo 2011 limited improvements are possible via indoor water conservation while stormwater supply for irrigation is costly this strategy may be important in cities with limited water supply regulatory frameworks are needed to expand regional scale projects that use stormwater as a supply luthy et al 2019 in general policy that enables use of alternate water sources can improve water supply reliability however strategies that are implemented at a single residence scale e g roof runoff supply and graywater for irrigation were not found to be as cost effective as those at multi residential regional or municipal scales fig 5 5 conclusion this study presents a framework that couples the iuwm with nsga ii multiobjective optimization to assess tradeoffs between urban water strategies that reduce demand for traditional supplies and their associated costs cost effective water conservation and fit for purpose water strategies meeting a wide range of water demand reduction targets were identified for each of the three study cities results show discrete strategy performance in demand reduction between cities influenced by local climate land cover and population density because climate and development patterns impact efficacy of water demand reduction strategies future research should address the efficacy of strategies under uncertain future conditions the top performing strategies overall in terms of water savings and total cost were found to be efficient irrigation systems and stormwater for irrigation efficacy of conversion to efficient irrigation systems is only relevant where automated irrigation systems are the dominant practice incentive programs to encourage transition to more efficient sprinkler systems may be effective but may be most effective by targeting large outdoor water users with automated irrigation systems while use of stormwater achieves large demand reduction relative to other strategies it only occurred in high ranked solutions that were characterized by higher cost this strategy can be very effective for demand reduction but is also costly also important is that stormwater supply for irrigation and potable irrigation was found to be effective in the cities studied here when considering tradeoffs between cost and demand reduction potential while separate supply of treated stormwater for toilet flushing was not graywater use for toilet flushing at the multi residential neighborhood scale and centralized wastewater supply for irrigation appeared in top ranked solutions across all three study cities and should be considered when it is a goal to balance cost and demand reduction potential policy that enables use of alternate water sources at scales beyond single residence can increase local water supplies and be cost effective credit authorship

8589,the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation extremes dramatically affects various socio economic activities in dryland based on the long term and high resolution daily precipitation obtained from the national oceanic and atmosphere administration noaa climate prediction center cpc the total summer precipitation tsp precipitation extreme and persistent precipitation extreme ppe characteristics are revealed in central asia ca 34 3 n 55 4 n and 46 5 e 96 4 e during 1979 2018 results show that tsp precipitation extreme and ppe in ca are significantly increased and the abrupt increasing occurred mainly in 1998 additionally proportion of precipitation extreme in tsp also increases more significant positive trends of tsp precipitation extreme and ppe occur in zones of northern kazakhstan nkz and tienshan mountain range tsm notably although pep in other regions exhibit indistinctive changes ppe in some particular years abnormally frequent which may leads disasters further analyses indicate tsp and precipitation extreme in ca have significant positive correlation with the increasing water vapor transport from the southern boundary meanwhile increasing horizontal moisture advection and enhanced vertical moisture advection contributes to increasing in tsp and precipitation extreme in nkz and tsm in addition negative phase of east atlantic west russia ea wr may result in the cyclone anomalous and deepened trough over ca which cooperates with enhanced vertical advection and abnormal south moisture finally provides favorable conditions for precipitation and precipitation extreme keywords total summer precipitation precipitation extreme persistent precipitation extreme central asia water vapor transport east atlantic west russia 1 introduction precipitation has been the focus of climate change research due to its controlling role in environmental economic and social development alexander 2016 kumar et al 2013 xue et al 2017 yu et al 2017 according to the fifth assessment report of the ipcc 2013 extreme events trend to more frequency complexity and intensity with the impact of global warming therefore the examination of extreme climate events has attracted increasing attention different studies depicts that under the influence of global warming heavy precipitation events are likely to enhance in regions along with increases in total precipitation and events such as those seen in northwestern china european united states australia and other areas have confirmed the above conclusions barbero et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2015 wang et al 2013 zheng et al 2015 precipitation extreme events can lead to floods mudslides and building collapses wang et al 2018 xiao et al 2016 meanwhile global warming via the water cycle intensifies its intensity and frequency and collectively affects social and climate change allan and soden 2008 fernandes and rodrigues 2017 guo and wang 2014 trenberth and guillemot 1995 zhang et al 2013 in arid areas precipitation extreme has become extraordinarily signality and complicated as these regions represent fragile ecosystems and are highly sensitive to climate change wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 hu et al 2016 additionally some previous studies have also focused on the persistent precipitation extreme ppe events that emphasize precipitation extreme events sustaining more than isolated 1 day chen and zhai 2013 2016 müller et al 2009 ppe is more likely to cause floods and debris and river flows in arid and semiarid regions deng et al 2014 mariotti et al 2010 during the last half century increasing numbers of heavy rain days have occurred in the semiarid and arid united states europe and australia donat et al 2017 gallant et al 2014 xue et al 2017 such positive trends are also observed over northwestern china and precipitation extreme has begun to moderate the variations in total precipitation chen et al 2014 huang et al 2015 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2015a precipitation extreme in central asia ca has undergone a prominent increasing trend zhang et al 2017 and has caused more natural disasters and urgent impacts on terrestrial ecosystems environmental and climate change and sustainable development of society in addition pertinent studies about precipitation extreme and ppe events in ca are still deficient thus investigating researches to understand the trends and variations in precipitation extreme and ppe are important the arid and semiarid ca is one of the largest non zonal arid regions in the world and ecological pattern is unique with the coexistence of deserts oases ice snow mountains and lakes and is extraordinarily sensitive to global warming lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 wang et al 2013 hu et al 2014 moreover it plays a vital role in the silk road economic belt and the 21st century maritime silk road the environmental climatic and ecological changes in this region are crucial for major decisions about social and economic development thus increasing numbers of scholars have begun to keep a watchful eye on climate changes in this region aizen et al 2001 chen et al 2008a chen and chen 2012 hu et al 2017 therefore recent research has begun to focus on the impacts of precipitation extreme in ca due to its catastrophic consequences mathis et al 2014 hu et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 2017 meanwhile the possible influences from atmospheric circulation and other natural factors have been investigated the westerly jet stream and the south asian high are very likely to alter precipitation over ca bothe et al 2012 chen et al 2018 furthermore wei et al 2016 found that summer precipitation extreme in north xinjiang is likely affected by moisture from the north atlantic ocean the eurasian continent and the indian ocean the precipitation extreme indices have been used to analyze extreme events over ca and the results show significant increasing zhang et al 2019 2017 however surface observation data in ca are relatively sparse obtaining long term consecutive and accurate daily precipitation records from more datasets is essential detailed documented summer precipitation extreme events in ca are still deficient and spatiotemporal changes and physical causes are relatively scarce therefore the objective of our study is to examine the long term spatiotemporal variability of summer precipitation and precipitation extreme from 1979 to 2018 in ca meanwhile the possible mechanisms underlying the changes in summer precipitation and precipitation extreme are also investigated the national oceanic and atmosphere administration noaa climate prediction center cpc high resolution daily precipitation data set during the study period have been processed the structure of this paper is organized as follows the study area data and methods are introduced in section 2 the results derived from the spatiotemporal features in the precipitation indices are described in section 3 the mechanism analyses are addressed in section 4 and followed in section 4 are the discussion and conclusions the results from this study are aimed at providing valuable references for future precipitation forecasts and disaster prevention and mitigation in ca the structure and methods have shown in fig 1 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area the ca is one of the world most famous arid and semiarid regions locates in the hinterlands of eurasia continent previous studies exhibited that multiple datasets captured the ca has experienced more significant warming trend than the global average hu et al 2014 under the influence of global warming annual precipitation in ca shows a slightly increasing trend xu et al 2015 hu et al 2017 the summer precipitation has the same variations as the annual precipitation and significantly impacts the annual precipitation hu et al 2016 moreover zhang et al 2017 reported that based on daily observed precipitation data precipitation extreme events also have experienced increasing trends the fragile ecosystem in arid and semiarid ca make it more responsive to climate extreme events motivated by aforesaid researches this study concentrates on the summer precipitation and precipitation extreme in ca encompassed with five countries kazakhstan uzbekistan turkmenistan tajikistan kyrgyzstan and the xinjiang uygur autonomous region of china our study region expands from 34 3 to 55 4 n and from 46 5 to 96 4 e in fig 2 chen and zhou 2015 zhang et al 2017 2 2 data the daily precipitation data in this study is obtained from national oceanic and atmosphere administration noaa climate prediction center cpc url ftp ftp cdc noaa gov datasets cpc global precip in addition to the observed climate anomaly monitoring system cams and global telecommunication system gts cpc also collects daily precipitation from the national weather service nws river forecast centers rfc the hydrologic automated data system hads and national collections from meteorological agencies in mexico and countries in south america east asia and africa dense gauge precipitation observations relatively provided by the data combination the optimal interpolation oi objective analysis technique also utilizes to create a suite of unified precipitation products in addition cpc launches to construct quality controlled unified gauge and gauge satellite merged high resolution gauge based global daily precipitation chen et al 2008b xie et al 2007 it is with 0 5 latitude 0 5 longitude covers from 1979 to present and has been widely utilized for climate monitor and climate forecast verification silva et al 2011 carvalho et al 2012 preethi et al 2011 proved that the mean and extremes rainfall are captured consistent by the cpc data comparison with india meteorological department imd over most of india thus for this study we have selected the continuous daily precipitation data for the period of 1979 2018 in ca and before using this data for analysis we refer to other precipitation data sets to make the following results more convincing global precipitation climatology project gpcp climate data record cdr url https www ncei noaa gov data global precipitation climatology project gpcp daily access is engaged as reference dataset in this study gpcp provides merged global satellite and gauge information products with long term period from october 1996 to present on a daily 1 1 horizontal resolution adler et al 2003 bolvin et al 2008 huffman et al 2001 exhibited that the gpcp global daily data has superb continuity in time and data boundaries in addition to aforesaid data sets the trmm 3b42 v7 daily precipitation data url https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets trmm 3b42 daily 7 is engaged to estimate the cpc daily precipitation the trmm 3b42 v7 is reproduced by an optimal combination of trmm microwave imager tmi the special sensor microwave imager ssm i the advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr and the advanced microwave sounding amsu zhao and yatagai 2014 the trmm 3b42 v7 with long term period from 1998 to present has high spatial resolution 0 25 0 25 and the spatial coverage contains from 180 w 180 e and 50 s 50 n thus one of the limitations in current retrieval techniques is lacking observation at high latitudes katiraie boroujerdy et al 2017 according to the trmm 3b42 v7 spatial coverage the region expands from 34 3 to 50 n and from 46 5 to 96 4 e has selected for comparison firstly the results have shown good agreement between the cpc and gpcp precipitation data in ca during 1997 2018 in fig 3 the tsp spatial distribution are consistent in fig 3 a and b the higher tsp is mainly located in the north of kazakhstan and the tienshan mountain range according to fig 3 c the root mean square error rmse of the two datasets is generally less than 1 mm in most ca rmse reached 2 mm mainly occurred in the north of kazakhstan and tienshan mountain range which is likely caused by interpolation due to the low resolution of gpcp the correlation coefficient between the time series of gpcp and cpc during 1997 2018 is 0 89 above 99 confidence level secondly the comparison between cpc and trmm 3b42 v7 exhibited in reference fig 1 the tsp has spatially coherent during 1998 2018 and the highest tsp is mainly located in tienshan mountain range thus reference fig 1c showed the time series of regional average in 74 e 88 e and 40 n 44 n captured by cpc and trmm 3b42 v7 the two series show coincident trend and the correlation coefficient reaches 0 91 above 99 confidence level although previous study found that trmm 3b42 v7 product had uncertainties caused by orographic convection the two data sets captured consistent spatial distribution and variation trend in the selected region kim et al 2016 notably trmm 3b42 v7 data set shows higher magnitudes which probably due to the observation methods of microwave radiometers boarded on satellite previous researches found in the mountainous area of iran which is adjacent to the ca the trmm 3b42v7 overestimates most of the extreme precipitation indices katiraie boroujerdy et al 2017 the high resolution trmm 3b42v7 data record can be employed for further researches such as single extreme precipitation events therefore the cpc data set generally depicts the precipitation in ca to understand the related impact factors of the precipitation extreme in ca the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf re analysis era interim dataset is utilized dee et al 2011 it is improved by moisture analysis and satellite data error correction technology hodges et al 2011 the

sillmann et al 2013 tank et al 2006 detailed descriptions of the indices are shown in table 1 in addition we also define a new extreme index persistent precipitation extreme ppe which reflects both intensity and the persistence of precipitation combining the arid and semiarid climate in ca and the previous definition of ppe in other region chen and zhai 2013 ppe is defined as the following criteria the daily precipitation amount must 10 mm for at least 2 consecutive days ordinary least squares fits is employed to calculate the linear trends of the indices and considered to be statistically significant at 5 level the significance is tested using a student s t test trends of individual grids and the whole region are showed a 9 year running mean is applied to isolate the interdecadal feature the mann kendall nonparametric statistical test is employed to detect abrupt change time for indices alexander et al 2006 attaur and dawood 2017 hamed 2008 spearman s correlation analysis is also used to investigate the statistical relationships cort et al 2015 the significance levels of 5 are considered to be statistically significant the empirical orthogonal function eof analysis is widely used in climate research to characterize the dominant spatial patterns and the corresponding temporal variability of different meteorological factors ramsey and wilks 1996 although the results of eof can validly isolate the principal patterns of variables it also shows disadvantages in disposing artificial structures and physical interpretations liu et al 2017 thus the rotation experience orthogonal function reof analysis is developed to improve these defects of eof reof analysis can simplify spatial structures and simultaneously retain the robust patterns mestas nunze and enfield 1999 lian and chen 2012 it is applied to isolate coherent sub regions where summer precipitation have similar variations paegle and mo 2002 o lenic and livezey 1988 proposed eight number of eof modes entering the rotation the water vapor transport is one direct and crucial factor for the precipitation and precipitation extreme change zhang 2001 li et al 2016 the vertical integrated water vapor transport flux is calculated by the method proposed in trenberth 1991 1 q u 1 g p x p t u q d p q v 1 g p x p t v q d p in our study the vertical integration is computed from surface to 300 hpa using era interim datasets to understand the relationship between moisture transport and precipitation the moisture budget equation through the whole troposphere has been considered to show the

distributions of tsp and precipitation extreme in this section annual averaged tsp fig 4 a generally clarifies a distinct meridional gradient in ca and the higher precipitation centralized toward north 50 n exceeding 140 mm the maximum tsp locates in the tienshan mountain range and exceeds 200 mm this indicates the strong influence of orographic effects on total precipitation similar phenomena have been found in other mountainous regions barrett et al 2009 the precipitation deficient regions locate in southern kazakhstan uzbekistan turkmenistan and tajikistan are below than 20 mm and the southern xinjiang is lower than 40 mm these regions contain desert areas spatial distributions of summer precipitation extreme indices exhibit in fig 4b f the r90tot has a similar spatial distribution to tsp in fig 4b the pick exceeds 90 mm in the tienshan mountain range the minimum lower than 10 mm occurs in southern kazakhstan uzbekistan turkmenistan and tajikistan to obtain more representative precipitation extreme characteristics the intensity indices rx1day has been included in fig 4c high values of rx1day occurs only in northern kazakhstan north of 46 n and tienshan mountain range higher than 18 mm but also in southern xinjiang reaching more than 12 mm in fig 4d and e r90fre and r10mm are employed to describe the frequency of precipitation extreme events the regions with frequent precipitation extreme are consistent with tsp and r90tot the highest value reaching 6 days occurs in north kazakhstan and tienshan mountain range the r10mm ranges between 1 and 6 days the highest values are also found in in tienshan mountain range the values of cwd are from 0 to 6 days the northern kazakhstan and tienshan mountain range dominate the highest values in fig 4f the lower values of r90fre r10mm and cwd generally appear in similar areas as tsp and r90tot 3 2 trends of tsp and precipitation extreme during the study period the significance changes in tsp and precipitation extremes are observed in ca in fig 5 both tsp and precipitation extreme indices have significantly increased at rates of 0 55 mm a 0 36 mm a 0 10 mm a 0 03 day a 0 01 day a and 0 02 day a respectively the interdecadal change characteristic reveal both in tsp and precipitation extremes in contrast tsp r90tot and r90fre show more dramatically increasing trends which indicates that wet conditions significantly increased during 1979 2018 the regional average values of tsp and precipitation extreme indices exhibit marked change around the abrupt year in table2 abrupt changes of r90tot r10mm occurred in 1998 and 1999 are statistical significance r90tot and r10mm are 21 03 mm a and 0 74 day a before abrupt year and are 25 85 mm a 0 95 day a after abrupt year although the abrupt time of other variables have lower statistical significance level both the mean values of tsp and precipitation extreme indices in ca distinctly add after the abrupt time coincidentally the contribution of precipitation extreme for summer precipitation calculated by r90tot tsp also shows significantly increasing 0 12 a shown in reference fig 2 the proportion of precipitation extreme in tsp has increased during 1979 2018 the average contribution of summer precipitation extreme to the tsp is approximately 45 2 and the abrupt increase year happened in 2001 in particular after the abrupt year the mean proportion reaches 47 3 and larger than 43 4 during 1979 2000 clearly the significant increase in summer precipitation extreme makes notable contribution to the tsp previous studies by zhang 2017 indicated that precipitation extreme has become more frequent in the arid and semi arid ca in recent decades the spatial distributions of linear trends of tsp and the precipitation extreme indices in ca are shown in fig 6 the results depicts significant positive trends are mainly occurred in northeastern kazakhstan and tienshan mountain range in fig 6a the maximum of the trend coefficients reaches more than 2 5 mm a in contrast significant negative trends exhibit in uzbekistan turkmenistan kyrgyzstan and eastern xinjiang with a maximum of approximately 1 5 mm a the aforementioned results reveal that summer precipitation in ca tended to increase in wetter areas during 1979 2018 while decreasing trends generally aggravated in southern desert areas and east xinjiang zhang et al 2017 hu et al 2019 similarly the significant increasing trends of r90tot locate in northern kazakhstan and tienshan mountain range decreasing trends locate in uzbekistan turkmenistan kyrgyzstan and eastern xinjiang and consistent with the trends of tsp in fig 6b maximum increasing trend of r90tot approximately achieves 2 0 mm a and decreasing trend is 0 5 mm a positive trends in rx1day are exhibited for most of the ca except for the southern regions and a small part in west kazakhstan and eastern xinjiang and distinct spatial heterogeneity has shown in fig 6c spatial trends distribution of r90fre and r10mm in fig 6d and e over the whole region experience similar manner to tsp and r90tot the maximum increasing of r90fre and r10mm in northeastern ca and tienshan mountain range can reach 0 1 day a discriminatively the decreasing trends of r90fre in uzbekistan turkmenistan kyrgyzstan and eastern xinjiang much stronger than r10mm exceeding 0 1 day a the cwd fig 6f exhibits significant positive trends in eastern southwestern kazakhstan and western xingjiang as can be seen from cwd the most ca reveals wetter conditions while the drought condition in southern desert areas are aggravated both tsp and precipitation extreme in most eastern ca show increasing trends during the period 1979 2018 the positive correlations between tsp and precipitation extreme are statistically significant combining the contribution and correlation of precipitation extreme on tsp precipitation extreme has a far reaching impact on summer precipitation in ca the increasing precipitation extreme exert more severe impacts on agriculture water resources and other natural resources bothe et al 2012 which makes researches of precipitation extreme in arid and semarid ca become more meaningful and essential 3 3 variations of tsp and precipitation extreme in sub regions the sub regions variations of tsp and precipitation extreme are discussed through reof analysis on tsp during the period 1979 2018 reofs analysis is rotated based on eight eofs entering the varimax rotation and their accumulated variances reach 85 30 shown in reference table 2 o lenic and livezey 1988 finally the first five reofs are plotted in fig 7 the first five reofs explain nearly 42 57 variance therefore tacking the first five reofs of tsp geography and administrative boundary into consideration the ca is divided into five climate zones the following discussions are analyzed in different climate zones are south central asia sca 38 n 41 n 55 e 81 e north kazakhstan nkz 48 n 53 n 66 e 78 e southeast xinjiang sex 37 n 42 n 82 e 90 e west kazakhstan wkz 47 n 51 n 50 e 63 e and the tienshan mountain range tsm 41 n 46 n 70 e 88 e the tsp and precipitation extreme indices have shown remarkable regional discrepancies in ca the long term trends for tsp and precipitation extreme in nkz and tsm are mainly dominated by upward trends in fig 8 the tsp r90tot r90fre r10mm and cwd are dramatically increasing respectively in 0 69 mm a 0 43 mm a 0 04 day a 0 04 day a and 0 03 day a at 0 01 confidence level in nkz in fig 8a f and the rx1day increases with 0 05 mm a at 0 05 confidence level the tsp r90tot and r90fre in tsm region shown in fig 8g l increasing trends are respectively 0 55 mm a 0 44 mm a and 0 05 day a at 0 01 confidence level r10mm and cwd are 0 02 day a and 0 01 day a at 0 05 confidence level besides rx1day shows indistinctive increasing however regions like sca and wkz have experienced indistinctive reduced trends during the study period in addition tsp and precipitation extreme in sex have no significant changes during the study period shown in reference fig 3 according to the results of each sub regions in ca summer precipitation and precipitation extreme mainly increase significantly in regions with abundant rainfall while in desert even decrease zhang et al 2017 it is likely to deepen the flood disaster in humid regions and further aggravate the drought in desert regions 3 4 characters of ppe in ca ppe events are more likely to cause flooding and have attracted scientific attentions in recent years junker et al 2008 chen and zhai 2016 although precipitation is scarce in ca recently more and more ppe events have been reported as they lead to floods debris flows mountain collapses and other disasters for instance on july 30 2018 ppe in hami xinjiang province directly affected the agriculture and transportation https news cngold org fig 9 shows the distribution of annual average ppe frequency in ca and the time series for five climate zones during 1979 2018 such events can hardly observe in southern kazakhstan uzbekistan turkmenistan and tajikistan the most frequent areas are at northeastern kazakhstan and tienshan mountain range and the frequency can exceed 20 times a the northern kazakhstan ppe events happens most frequent at a rate of 12 times a in sca the frequency of ppe events is exiguity and has no significant change as the nkz with the most abundant precipitation in ca the frequency of ppe events are corresponding higher and show significant increasing trends about 0 58 times a above 0 05 confidence level during the study period ppe discontinuously happens in sex but the high frequency years 1979 1981 1988 2005 2007 have seriously affected the average ppe in wkz also shows inconsecutive occurrence and mainly concentrates in the domain 51 n and 54 e 64 e like other precipitation extreme indices the frequency of ppe in the tsm also shows significant increasing trend about 0 34 times a above 0 05 confidence level in many previous studies the ppe events is prone to response for the stable and persistent anomalous atmospheric circulations miao et al 2019 chen and zhai 2016 reported that ppe events are most likely to induce by the interaction of several key and long term circulation anomalies these ppe events can easily trigger disasters like flooding landslide and debris flow easterling 2000 chen and zhai 2013 with long duration and great intensity the ppe events in ca usually occur in rainy season and have destructive impacts although some sub regions in ca ppe events do not increase significantly the high frequency in several special years can have serious impacts one ppe event known as 7 17 in 2007 xinjiang main characteristics of this precipitation extreme weather process are high intensity long duration and wide influence range the daily precipitation in six meteorological stations broke the record and ranked the second in history this event lead to enormous economy losses and casualties wang et al 2011 therefore in arid and semi arid ca where ecosystems are fragile lands are barren and concurrently includes mountain areas such precipitation extreme events deserve more attentions 3 5 the related physical mechanisms 3 5 1 impacts of water vapor to explore the possible causes of summer precipitation and precipitation extreme in ca we further discuss the distribution patterns and variation of water vapor transport for the period of 1979 2018 the climatological mean water vapor input in ca mainly transported by prevailing westerlies from the western boundary huang et al 2013 yatagai 2003 and the second is from northern boundary in fig 10 a four boundaries summer vertical water vapor fluxes have been calculated from the surface to 300 hpa during the study period in the western boundary vertically integrated water vapor is about 0 26 106 kg s 1 the northern boundary also act as transfer passage and the vertically integrated water vapor is about 0 11 106kg s 1 the main output occurs in the eastern boundary and the magnitude is 0 46 106 kg s 1 besides water vapor exports in the south boundary is about 0 19 106 kg s 1 fig 10b e present the vertically integrated water vapor anomalies in different boundaries from 1979 to 2018 significant decreasing in water vapor outputs from the southern and eastern boundary have been detected the abrupt mann kendall test indicates that significant decreasing in southern and eastern boundaries in 1998 and which consists with increasing summer precipitation and precipitation extreme in table 2 further discussion about the correlation between precipitation index and each boundary water vapor transport are exhibited the impact of water vapor from four directions at different regions on the tsp and precipitation extreme in ca are further discussed and the results are shown in fig 11 in general tsp and precipitation extreme in ca are positively correlated with water vapor transported by the westerlies especially in sca and tsm because ca is located in the core region of the westerlies chen et al 2008a the five sub regions generally show negative correlations with the water vapor transport in the eastern boundary and the correlations are not significant the water vapor transport in northern bound is positively correlated with tsp and precipitation extremes in nkz region though the correlations are not significant the south boundary shows a significant negative correlation in nkz and stm and has unobvious positive correlation in other regions combined the significantly decreased water vapor transport in the southern and eastern boundaries of ca in fig 10c and 10e the increasing tsp and precipitation extreme in nkz and stm regions is closely related to the decrease of water vapor output in the southern boundary we further reveal the distribution patterns of water vapor flux anomalies for the periods 1979 1997 and 1998 2018 in fig 12 a an anomalous anti cyclonic circulation was present in the middle ca accompanying strong anomalous cyclonic over the east europe and over the novosibirsk which induces northwesterly water vapor flux anomalies occurred over eastern ca during the period 1979 1997 the southern boundary dominated by the northerly wind and act as water vapor outlet on the contrary after 1998 an anomalous cyclonic in the middle ca combined with two abnormal anticyclones on its both sides and anomalous water vapor transports from the arabian sea to ca in fig 12b recent work has shown that precipitation in ca is influenced by el niño southern oscillation enso hu et al 2019 detected significant correlations between enso and the precipitation in ca especially during el niño years previous research found enso sst anomalies induce atmospheric anomalies via rossby wave train arching from the pacific into the atlantic region and an extension of the enso induced trough over the european promotes positive precipitation anomalies buli and kucharski 2012 besides in previous works warming of the indian ocean is regarded as part of the el niño signal kug and kang 2006 which has significant impacts on precipitation extremes by anomalous water vapor transmission gao et al 2017 enso induced low pressure anomalies increased the precipitation in ca by strengthening the westerly and southwesterly water vapor respectively from the north atlantic ocean and indian ocean to ca chen et al 2018 hu et al 2019 in addition wang et al 2010 exhibited that the caspian seas are also closely related with the precipitation in ca by adjusting westerly water vapor in summary the increase of tsp and precipitation extreme in ca show more close relationship with abnormal water vapor input from the southern boundary which may relate to enso signal the ocean influences on precipitation and precipitation extremes in ca should be noticeable and need more exploration in future we compare the moisture budget in different sub regions for two distinct periods during 1979 1997 and 1998 2018 precipitation change is balanced by the changes of thermodynamic components evaporation dynamic and residual term lin et al 2014 climatological mean precipitation in ca is mainly adjusted by evaporation vertical and horizontal moisture advection and residual terms the magnitude of the residual terms probable contact with complex topography and land surface processes bao and you 2019 in sca precipitation scarcely changes in the two periods in fig 13 a as there are more deserts in this region local water vapor changes less evaporation is greater and subsidence is prevailing in nkz precipitation obviously increases after 1998 in fig 13b as evidently vertical ascending moisture advection and slightly positive horizontal moisture advection besides local moisture are decreased which indicates that airborne moisture is partly transformed into precipitation in nkz the precipitation in sex is slightly decreased which related to the decreased horizontal moisture advection and increased residual terms in wca precipitation reduced after 1998 accompanying with decreasing horizontal vertical moisture advection and increased residual terms in fig 13d precipitation increased in tsm after 1998 in fig 13e is primarily contributed by the significantly positive vertical moisture advection and decreased residual term moisture budget anomalies in nkz and tsm conducive to enhance the precipitation as high correlation between tsp and precipitation extreme in ca the influence factors of precipitation also play a regulatory role in precipitation extreme events 3 5 2 large scale circulation anomaly the distribution patterns of geopotential height anomalies at 200 hpa for the periods 1979 1997 and 1998 2018 are investigated in fig 14 the geopotential height center anomalies over eastern europe and novosibirsk oppositely changed and anomalies negative center in ca strengthened after 1998 the geopotential height anomalies at 200 hpa is consistent with the negative phase of ea wr in fig 14c a significant decreasing trend in the ea wr exhibits which indicates it convert to negative pattern and the mann kendall test found that abrupt decrease year of ea wr is 1999 subsequently table 3 shows tsp and precipitation extreme indices are negatively correlated with the ea wr in 1979 2018 the tsp r90tot rx1day r90fre r10mm and cwd are significantly negative correlated with the ea wr respectively 0 43 0 49 0 42 0 48 0 55 and 0 52 above 99 confidence level besides the frequency of ppe also negatively correlated with ea wr and the correlation coefficient is 0 37 above 95 confidence level a comprehensive analysis of the spatial patterns of correlation coefficients in ca is further shown in fig 14 d negative geopotential height anomaly and a cyclonic anomaly exhibit at 500 hpa over northern ca in addition in cooperation with the positive geopotential height and the anti cyclonic anomalies over mongolia the southerly winds in the arabian sea are guided to eastern ca additionally the 560 hpa geopotential height contour is employed to be in half of the trough in northern ca it is worth noting that the trough significantly southwardly deepened after 1998 thus when the ea wr turns to negative pattern after 1999 it induces anomaly negative geopotential height over ca and positive geopotential height over mongolia to deepens the trough in northern ca and accompanies with anomalous south moisture transport to east ca provides favorable conditions for precipitation and extreme precipitation increasing especially in nkz and tsm 4 discussion and conclusions the primary purpose of this study is to investigate spatiotemporal variations of summer precipitation and precipitation extreme in ca from 1979 to 2018 using high resolution cpc daily precipitation data firstly different extreme precipitation indices are defined to quantify the intensity frequency and persistence of precipitation extreme events in ca then reof technique is conducted to study regional variations we also explored possible physical mechanisms related to the subsequent trend of precipitation and precipitation extreme the main results are summarized below 1 the tsp and precipitation extreme in ca generally exhibit a meridional gradient and larger magnitudes occur to the north of 50 n and in the tienshan mountain range additionally rx1day also exhibits larger values in south xinjiang the precipitation extreme indices are strongly positive correlated with tsp the tsp and precipitation extreme have decadal increasing trends during 1979 2018 and abrupt increased after 1998 furthermore the proportion of summer precipitation extreme in the tsp also increased 2 for the sub regions in ca the nkz and tsm have shown distinct increasing trends in the tsp and precipitation extreme from 1979 to 2018 in contrast sca shows indistinct decreasing trends 3 ppe events also occur in arid and semiarid ca in the nkz and stm significant increasing trends also reveal although other regions exhibit no significant trends such extreme events due to their intensity long duration and wide sphere could cause more serious disasters in the ca 4 this study also investigates the possible mechanisms for the increasing tsp and precipitation extreme in ca after 1998 the anomalous water vapor transport in the southern boundary of ca is significantly correlated with the increase of tsp and precipitation extreme meanwhile enhanced vertical moisture advection and tsm and increase horizontal moisture advection in nkz mainly contribute to the increasing of tsp and precipitation extreme in these regions 5 the ea wr pattern is negatively correlated tsp and precipitation extreme indices in ca in 1979 2018 and turns to negative phase after 1999 the negative ea wr phase induces abnormal negative geopotential height in ca and deepens the trough in northern ca which cooperates with the northward water vapor transport and ascending motion in nkz and tsm establishes favorable conditions for precipitation and precipitation extreme in summary our study exhibits both summer precipitation and precipitation extreme spatiotemporal features in the ca during the last forty years we also firstly analyzed ppe events in ca and the possible physical processes through moisture conditions and large scale circulation aspects have been discussed the aforementioned conclusions are based on climatological background explanations from synoptic aspect also have discussed in reference figs 4 and 5 the composite of 10 precipitation extreme events simultaneously happened in the nkz and tsm confirm that the synoptic scale convergence movement and the vertical ascending motion are reinforced from the composite map at 850 hpa in reference fig 4 we can see that anomalous cyclone center in ca and gradually strengthened and moved eastward when it arrived northeast ca the anomalous cyclone leads the precipitation extreme in addition anomalous northerly wind guide water vapor into the north of kazakhstan while the anomalous southerly leads warm moisture transported to the southern xinjiang at the same time it can be seen from 500 hpa in reference fig 5 the negative ea wr pattern gradually moved to the southeast and when extreme precipitation occurred the anomalous cyclone center located in the northeast of ca the understanding of summer precipitation and precipitation extreme is refined in ca proposed in the literature hu et al 2017 huang et al 2013 xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 2019 previous studies evidenced that both the anthropogenic and natural influence have been detected in increasing summer precipitation over ca peng et al 2018 wei et al 2016 song et al 2014 the temperature increasing in ca is more prominent than global average during latest decades moreover the warming in ca in the first 12 years of the 21st century is much stronger than previous decades and becomes the most outstanding climate variations hu et al 2014 this study emphasizes that the summer precipitation extreme in ca during 1979 2018 exhibit increasing trends especially in tsm and nkz the atmospheric water cycle has enhanced at the global and regional scales with the global warming bengtsson 2010 guo and wang 2014 bosilovich et al 2005 and xinjiang has been investigated that the hydrological cycle also shows significant intensifying with rapid warming and positively correlates to increased precipitation feng and wu 2016 yao et al 2020 under the aforementioned conditions warmer and wetter tendency are likely to continue in ca which may induce frequent precipitation extremes in the future the mechanism researches of precipitation extreme in ca is still rare exploring causes of precipitation and precipitation extreme changes in ca is still challenging and signality in climate statistics climate dynamics and numerical experiments more detail research in this field will be discussed in future credit authorship contribution

8589,the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation extremes dramatically affects various socio economic activities in dryland based on the long term and high resolution daily precipitation obtained from the national oceanic and atmosphere administration noaa climate prediction center cpc the total summer precipitation tsp precipitation extreme and persistent precipitation extreme ppe characteristics are revealed in central asia ca 34 3 n 55 4 n and 46 5 e 96 4 e during 1979 2018 results show that tsp precipitation extreme and ppe in ca are significantly increased and the abrupt increasing occurred mainly in 1998 additionally proportion of precipitation extreme in tsp also increases more significant positive trends of tsp precipitation extreme and ppe occur in zones of northern kazakhstan nkz and tienshan mountain range tsm notably although pep in other regions exhibit indistinctive changes ppe in some particular years abnormally frequent which may leads disasters further analyses indicate tsp and precipitation extreme in ca have significant positive correlation with the increasing water vapor transport from the southern boundary meanwhile increasing horizontal moisture advection and enhanced vertical moisture advection contributes to increasing in tsp and precipitation extreme in nkz and tsm in addition negative phase of east atlantic west russia ea wr may result in the cyclone anomalous and deepened trough over ca which cooperates with enhanced vertical advection and abnormal south moisture finally provides favorable conditions for precipitation and precipitation extreme keywords total summer precipitation precipitation extreme persistent precipitation extreme central asia water vapor transport east atlantic west russia 1 introduction precipitation has been the focus of climate change research due to its controlling role in environmental economic and social development alexander 2016 kumar et al 2013 xue et al 2017 yu et al 2017 according to the fifth assessment report of the ipcc 2013 extreme events trend to more frequency complexity and intensity with the impact of global warming therefore the examination of extreme climate events has attracted increasing attention different studies depicts that under the influence of global warming heavy precipitation events are likely to enhance in regions along with increases in total precipitation and events such as those seen in northwestern china european united states australia and other areas have confirmed the above conclusions barbero et al 2018 wasko and sharma 2015 wang et al 2013 zheng et al 2015 precipitation extreme events can lead to floods mudslides and building collapses wang et al 2018 xiao et al 2016 meanwhile global warming via the water cycle intensifies its intensity and frequency and collectively affects social and climate change allan and soden 2008 fernandes and rodrigues 2017 guo and wang 2014 trenberth and guillemot 1995 zhang et al 2013 in arid areas precipitation extreme has become extraordinarily signality and complicated as these regions represent fragile ecosystems and are highly sensitive to climate change wang et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 hu et al 2016 additionally some previous studies have also focused on the persistent precipitation extreme ppe events that emphasize precipitation extreme events sustaining more than isolated 1 day chen and zhai 2013 2016 müller et al 2009 ppe is more likely to cause floods and debris and river flows in arid and semiarid regions deng et al 2014 mariotti et al 2010 during the last half century increasing numbers of heavy rain days have occurred in the semiarid and arid united states europe and australia donat et al 2017 gallant et al 2014 xue et al 2017 such positive trends are also observed over northwestern china and precipitation extreme has begun to moderate the variations in total precipitation chen et al 2014 huang et al 2015 wang et al 2018 xu et al 2015a precipitation extreme in central asia ca has undergone a prominent increasing trend zhang et al 2017 and has caused more natural disasters and urgent impacts on terrestrial ecosystems environmental and climate change and sustainable development of society in addition pertinent studies about precipitation extreme and ppe events in ca are still deficient thus investigating researches to understand the trends and variations in precipitation extreme and ppe are important the arid and semiarid ca is one of the largest non zonal arid regions in the world and ecological pattern is unique with the coexistence of deserts oases ice snow mountains and lakes and is extraordinarily sensitive to global warming lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 wang et al 2013 hu et al 2014 moreover it plays a vital role in the silk road economic belt and the 21st century maritime silk road the environmental climatic and ecological changes in this region are crucial for major decisions about social and economic development thus increasing numbers of scholars have begun to keep a watchful eye on climate changes in this region aizen et al 2001 chen et al 2008a chen and chen 2012 hu et al 2017 therefore recent research has begun to focus on the impacts of precipitation extreme in ca due to its catastrophic consequences mathis et al 2014 hu et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 2017 meanwhile the possible influences from atmospheric circulation and other natural factors have been investigated the westerly jet stream and the south asian high are very likely to alter precipitation over ca bothe et al 2012 chen et al 2018 furthermore wei et al 2016 found that summer precipitation extreme in north xinjiang is likely affected by moisture from the north atlantic ocean the eurasian continent and the indian ocean the precipitation extreme indices have been used to analyze extreme events over ca and the results show significant increasing zhang et al 2019 2017 however surface observation data in ca are relatively sparse obtaining long term consecutive and accurate daily precipitation records from more datasets is essential detailed documented summer precipitation extreme events in ca are still deficient and spatiotemporal changes and physical causes are relatively scarce therefore the objective of our study is to examine the long term spatiotemporal variability of summer precipitation and precipitation extreme from 1979 to 2018 in ca meanwhile the possible mechanisms underlying the changes in summer precipitation and precipitation extreme are also investigated the national oceanic and atmosphere administration noaa climate prediction center cpc high resolution daily precipitation data set during the study period have been processed the structure of this paper is organized as follows the study area data and methods are introduced in section 2 the results derived from the spatiotemporal features in the precipitation indices are described in section 3 the mechanism analyses are addressed in section 4 and followed in section 4 are the discussion and conclusions the results from this study are aimed at providing valuable references for future precipitation forecasts and disaster prevention and mitigation in ca the structure and methods have shown in fig 1 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area the ca is one of the world most famous arid and semiarid regions locates in the hinterlands of eurasia continent previous studies exhibited that multiple datasets captured the ca has experienced more significant warming trend than the global average hu et al 2014 under the influence of global warming annual precipitation in ca shows a slightly increasing trend xu et al 2015 hu et al 2017 the summer precipitation has the same variations as the annual precipitation and significantly impacts the annual precipitation hu et al 2016 moreover zhang et al 2017 reported that based on daily observed precipitation data precipitation extreme events also have experienced increasing trends the fragile ecosystem in arid and semiarid ca make it more responsive to climate extreme events motivated by aforesaid researches this study concentrates on the summer precipitation and precipitation extreme in ca encompassed with five countries kazakhstan uzbekistan turkmenistan tajikistan kyrgyzstan and the xinjiang uygur autonomous region of china our study region expands from 34 3 to 55 4 n and from 46 5 to 96 4 e in fig 2 chen and zhou 2015 zhang et al 2017 2 2 data the daily precipitation data in this study is obtained from national oceanic and atmosphere administration

also utilizes to create a suite of unified precipitation products in addition cpc launches to construct quality controlled unified gauge and gauge satellite merged high resolution gauge based global daily precipitation chen et al 2008b xie et al 2007 it is with 0 5 latitude 0 5 longitude covers from 1979 to present and has been widely utilized for climate monitor and climate forecast verification silva et al 2011 carvalho et al 2012 preethi et al 2011 proved that the mean and extremes rainfall are captured consistent by the cpc data comparison with india meteorological department imd over most of india thus for this study we have selected the continuous daily precipitation data for the period of 1979 2018 in ca and before using this data for analysis we refer to other precipitation data sets to make the following results more convincing global precipitation climatology project gpcp climate data record cdr url https www ncei noaa gov data global precipitation climatology project gpcp daily access is engaged as reference dataset in this study gpcp provides merged global satellite and gauge information products with long term period from october 1996 to present on a daily 1 1 horizontal resolution adler et al 2003 bolvin et al 2008 huffman et al 2001 exhibited that the gpcp global daily data has superb continuity in time and data boundaries in addition to aforesaid data sets the trmm 3b42 v7 daily precipitation data url https disc gsfc nasa gov datasets trmm 3b42 daily 7 is engaged to estimate the cpc daily precipitation the trmm 3b42 v7 is reproduced by an optimal combination of trmm microwave imager tmi the special sensor microwave imager ssm i the advanced microwave scanning radiometer amsr and the advanced microwave sounding amsu zhao and yatagai 2014 the trmm 3b42 v7 with long term period from 1998 to present has high spatial resolution 0 25 0 25 and the spatial coverage contains from 180 w 180 e and 50 s 50 n thus one of the limitations in current retrieval techniques is lacking observation at high latitudes katiraie boroujerdy et al 2017 according to the trmm 3b42 v7 spatial coverage the region expands from 34 3 to 50 n and from 46 5 to 96 4 e has selected for comparison firstly the results have shown good agreement between the cpc and gpcp precipitation data in ca during 1997 2018 in fig 3 the tsp spatial distribution are consistent in fig 3 a and b the higher tsp is mainly located in the north of kazakhstan and the tienshan mountain range according to fig 3 c the root mean square error rmse of the two datasets is generally less than 1 mm in most ca rmse reached 2 mm mainly occurred in the north of kazakhstan and tienshan mountain range which is likely caused by interpolation due to the low resolution of gpcp the correlation coefficient between the time series of gpcp and cpc during 1997 2018 is 0 89 above 99 confidence level secondly the comparison between cpc and trmm 3b42 v7 exhibited in reference fig 1 the tsp has spatially coherent during 1998 2018 and the highest tsp is mainly located in tienshan mountain range thus reference fig 1c showed the time series of regional average in 74 e 88 e and 40 n 44 n captured by cpc and trmm 3b42 v7 the two series show coincident trend and the correlation coefficient reaches 0 91 above 99 confidence level although previous study found that trmm 3b42 v7 product had uncertainties caused by orographic convection the two data sets captured consistent spatial distribution and variation trend in the selected region kim et al 2016 notably trmm 3b42 v7 data set shows higher magnitudes which probably due to the observation methods of microwave radiometers boarded on satellite previous researches found in the mountainous area of iran which is adjacent to the ca the trmm 3b42v7 overestimates most of the extreme precipitation indices katiraie boroujerdy et al 2017 the high resolution trmm 3b42v7 data record can be employed for further researches such as single extreme precipitation events therefore the cpc data set generally depicts the precipitation in ca to understand the related impact factors of the precipitation extreme in ca the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf re analysis era interim dataset is utilized dee et al 2011 it is improved by moisture analysis and satellite data error correction technology hodges et al 2011 the 0 75 0 75 horizontal resolution era interim reanalysis datasets with four dimensional variational analysis are used this study use the daily mean specific humidity meridional and zonal winds evaporation geopotential heights and surface pressure data for the period from 1979 to 2018 with continuous global coverage the east atlantic west russia ea wr pattern is one of three prominent teleconnection patterns that affect eurasia throughout year and their time series can be obtained from the climate prediction center cpc and the ncep noaa web site http www cpc noaa gov data liu et al 2014 2 3 methodology precipitation extreme indices in this study are provided by the world meteorological organization wmo expert team on climate change detection and indices etccdi url http etccdi pacificclimate org list 27 indices shtml considering the unique climate characteristics of ca total summer precipitation accumulations from days with precipitation exceeding the 90th percentiles of daily precipitation and the frequency are denoted respectively by r90totand r90fre the summer maxima of daily precipitation rx1day summer count of days when precipitation 10 mm denotes by r10mm maximum number of consecutive days with precipitation 1 mm denotes by cwd besides total summer precipitation tsp is also used and compares with precipitation extreme indices costa and soares 2010 sillmann et al 2013 tank et al 2006 detailed descriptions of the indices are shown in table 1 in addition we also define a new extreme index persistent precipitation extreme ppe which reflects both intensity and the persistence of precipitation combining the arid and semiarid climate in ca and the previous definition of ppe in other region chen and zhai 2013 ppe is defined as the following criteria the daily precipitation amount must 10 mm for at least 2 consecutive days ordinary least squares fits is employed to calculate the linear trends of the indices and considered to be statistically significant at 5 level the significance is tested using a student s t test trends of individual grids and the whole region are showed a 9 year running mean is applied to isolate the interdecadal feature the mann kendall nonparametric statistical test is employed to detect abrupt change time for indices alexander et al 2006 attaur and dawood 2017 hamed 2008 spearman s correlation analysis is also used to investigate the statistical relationships cort et al 2015 the significance levels of 5 are considered to be statistically significant the empirical orthogonal function eof analysis is widely used in climate research to characterize the dominant spatial patterns and the corresponding temporal variability of different meteorological factors ramsey and wilks 1996 although the results of eof can validly isolate the principal patterns of variables it also shows disadvantages in disposing artificial structures and physical interpretations liu et al 2017 thus the rotation experience orthogonal function reof analysis is developed to improve these defects of eof reof analysis can simplify spatial structures and simultaneously retain the robust patterns mestas nunze and enfield 1999 lian and chen 2012 it is applied to isolate coherent sub regions where summer precipitation have similar variations paegle and mo 2002 o lenic and livezey 1988 proposed eight number of eof modes entering the rotation the water vapor transport is one direct and crucial factor for the precipitation and precipitation extreme change zhang 2001 li et al 2016 the vertical integrated water vapor transport flux is calculated by the method proposed in trenberth 1991 1 q u 1 g p x p t u q d p q v 1 g p x p t v q d p in our study the vertical integration is computed from surface to 300 hpa using era interim datasets to understand the relationship between moisture transport and precipitation the moisture budget equation through the whole troposphere has been considered to show the influence of moisture on precipitation bao and you 2019 li et al 2018 we discuss the moisture budget equation for each term the vertical mass integration form of the moisture budget equation through the whole troposphere is 2 p q t v h p q w p q p e δ q represents humidity and denotes vertical mass integration the left side term of equation is precipitation the q t is local variation in moisture the v h p q is horizontal moisture advection the w p q p is vertical moisture advection e represents evaporation and δ means a residual term trenberth and guillemot 1995 3 results 3 1 spatial distributions of tsp and precipitation extreme in this section annual averaged tsp fig 4 a generally clarifies a distinct meridional gradient in ca and the higher precipitation centralized toward north 50 n exceeding 140 mm the maximum tsp locates in the tienshan mountain range and exceeds 200 mm this indicates the strong influence of orographic effects on total precipitation similar phenomena have been found in other mountainous regions barrett et al 2009 the precipitation deficient regions locate in southern kazakhstan uzbekistan turkmenistan and tajikistan are below than 20 mm and the southern xinjiang is lower than 40 mm these regions contain desert areas spatial distributions of summer precipitation extreme indices exhibit in fig 4b f the r90tot has a similar spatial distribution to tsp in fig 4b the pick exceeds 90 mm in the tienshan mountain range the minimum lower than 10 mm occurs in southern kazakhstan uzbekistan turkmenistan and tajikistan to obtain more representative precipitation extreme characteristics the intensity indices rx1day has been included in fig 4c high values of rx1day occurs only in northern kazakhstan north of 46 n and tienshan mountain range higher than 18 mm but also in southern xinjiang reaching more than 12 mm in fig 4d and e r90fre and r10mm are employed to describe the frequency of precipitation extreme events the regions with frequent precipitation extreme are consistent with tsp and r90tot the highest value reaching 6 days occurs in north kazakhstan and tienshan mountain range the r10mm ranges between 1 and 6 days the highest values are also found in in tienshan mountain range the values of cwd are from 0 to 6 days the northern kazakhstan and tienshan mountain range dominate the highest values in fig 4f the lower values of r90fre r10mm and cwd generally appear in similar areas as tsp and r90tot 3 2 trends of tsp and precipitation extreme during the study period the significance changes in tsp and precipitation extremes are observed in ca in fig 5 both tsp and precipitation extreme indices have significantly increased at rates of 0 55 mm a 0 36 mm a 0 10 mm a 0 03 day a 0 01 day a and 0 02 day a respectively the interdecadal change characteristic reveal both in tsp and precipitation extremes in contrast tsp r90tot and r90fre show more dramatically increasing trends which indicates that wet conditions significantly increased during 1979 2018 the regional average values of tsp and precipitation extreme indices exhibit marked change around the abrupt year in table2 abrupt changes of r90tot r10mm occurred in 1998 and 1999 are statistical significance r90tot and r10mm are 21 03 mm a and 0 74 day a before abrupt year and are 25 85 mm a 0 95 day a after abrupt year although the abrupt time of other variables have lower statistical significance level both the mean values of tsp and precipitation extreme indices in ca distinctly add after the abrupt time coincidentally the contribution of precipitation extreme for summer precipitation calculated by r90tot tsp also shows significantly increasing 0 12 a shown in reference fig 2 the proportion of precipitation extreme in tsp has increased during 1979 2018 the average contribution of summer precipitation extreme to the tsp is approximately 45 2 and the abrupt increase year happened in 2001 in particular after the abrupt year the mean proportion reaches 47 3 and larger than 43 4 during 1979 2000 clearly the significant increase in summer precipitation extreme makes notable contribution to the tsp previous studies by zhang 2017 indicated that precipitation extreme has become more frequent in the arid and semi arid ca in recent decades the spatial distributions of linear trends of tsp and the precipitation extreme indices in ca are shown in fig 6 the results depicts significant positive trends are mainly occurred in northeastern kazakhstan and tienshan mountain range in fig 6a the maximum of the trend coefficients reaches more than 2 5 mm a in contrast significant negative trends exhibit in uzbekistan turkmenistan kyrgyzstan and eastern xinjiang with a maximum of approximately 1 5 mm a the aforementioned results reveal that summer precipitation in ca tended to increase in wetter areas during 1979 2018 while decreasing trends generally aggravated in southern desert areas and east xinjiang zhang et al 2017 hu et al 2019 similarly the significant increasing trends of r90tot locate in northern kazakhstan and tienshan mountain range decreasing trends locate in uzbekistan turkmenistan kyrgyzstan and eastern xinjiang and consistent with the trends of tsp in fig 6b maximum increasing trend of r90tot approximately achieves 2 0 mm a and decreasing trend is 0 5 mm a positive trends in rx1day are exhibited for most of the ca except for the southern regions and a small part in west kazakhstan and eastern xinjiang and distinct spatial heterogeneity has shown in fig 6c spatial trends distribution of r90fre and r10mm in fig 6d and e over the whole region experience similar manner to tsp and r90tot the maximum increasing of r90fre and r10mm in northeastern ca and tienshan mountain range can reach 0 1 day a discriminatively the decreasing trends of r90fre in uzbekistan turkmenistan kyrgyzstan and eastern xinjiang much stronger than r10mm exceeding 0 1 day a the cwd fig 6f exhibits significant positive trends in eastern southwestern kazakhstan and western xingjiang as can be seen from cwd the most ca reveals wetter conditions while the drought condition in southern desert areas are aggravated both tsp and precipitation extreme in most eastern ca show increasing trends during the period 1979 2018 the positive correlations between tsp and precipitation extreme are statistically significant combining the contribution and correlation of precipitation extreme on tsp precipitation extreme has a far reaching impact on summer precipitation in ca the increasing precipitation extreme exert more severe impacts on agriculture water resources and other natural resources bothe et al 2012 which makes researches of precipitation extreme in arid and semarid ca become more meaningful and essential 3 3 variations of tsp and precipitation extreme in sub regions the sub regions variations of tsp and precipitation extreme are discussed through reof analysis on tsp during the period 1979 2018 reofs analysis is rotated based on eight eofs entering the varimax rotation and their accumulated variances reach 85 30 shown in reference table 2 o lenic and livezey 1988 finally the first five reofs are plotted in fig 7 the first five reofs explain nearly 42 57 variance therefore tacking the first five reofs of tsp geography and administrative boundary into consideration the ca is divided into five climate zones the following discussions are analyzed in different climate zones are south central asia sca 38 n 41 n 55 e 81 e north kazakhstan nkz 48 n 53 n 66 e 78 e southeast xinjiang sex 37 n 42 n 82 e 90 e west kazakhstan wkz 47 n 51 n 50 e 63 e and the tienshan mountain range tsm 41 n 46 n 70 e 88 e the tsp and precipitation extreme indices have shown remarkable regional discrepancies in ca the long term trends for tsp and precipitation extreme in nkz and tsm are mainly dominated by upward trends in fig 8 the tsp r90tot r90fre r10mm and cwd are dramatically increasing respectively in 0 69 mm a 0 43 mm a 0 04 day a 0 04 day a and 0 03 day a at 0 01 confidence level in nkz in fig 8a f and the rx1day increases with 0 05 mm a at 0 05 confidence level the tsp r90tot and r90fre in tsm region shown in fig 8g l increasing trends are respectively 0 55 mm a 0 44 mm a and 0 05 day a at 0 01 confidence level r10mm and cwd are 0 02 day a and 0 01 day a at 0 05 confidence level besides rx1day shows indistinctive increasing however regions like sca and wkz have experienced indistinctive reduced trends during the study period in addition tsp and precipitation extreme in sex have no significant changes during the study period shown in reference fig 3 according to the results of each sub regions in ca summer precipitation and precipitation extreme mainly increase significantly in regions with abundant rainfall while in desert even decrease zhang et al 2017 it is likely to deepen the flood disaster in humid regions and further aggravate the drought in desert regions 3 4 characters of ppe in ca ppe events are more likely to cause flooding and have attracted scientific attentions in recent years junker et al 2008 chen and zhai 2016 although precipitation is scarce in ca recently more and more ppe events have been reported as they lead to floods debris flows mountain collapses and other disasters for instance on july 30 2018 ppe in hami xinjiang province directly affected the agriculture and transportation https news cngold org fig 9 shows the distribution of annual average ppe frequency in ca and the time series for five climate zones during 1979 2018 such events can hardly observe in southern kazakhstan uzbekistan turkmenistan and tajikistan the most frequent areas are at northeastern kazakhstan and tienshan mountain range and the frequency can exceed 20 times a the northern kazakhstan ppe events happens most frequent at a rate of 12 times a in sca the frequency of ppe events is exiguity and has no significant change as the nkz with the most abundant precipitation in ca the frequency of ppe events are corresponding higher and show significant increasing trends about 0 58 times a above 0 05 confidence level during the study period ppe discontinuously happens in sex but the high frequency years 1979 1981 1988 2005 2007 have seriously affected the average ppe in wkz also shows inconsecutive occurrence and mainly concentrates in the domain 51 n and 54 e 64 e like other precipitation extreme indices the frequency of ppe in the tsm also shows significant increasing trend about 0 34 times a above 0 05 confidence level in many previous studies the ppe events is prone to response for the stable and persistent anomalous atmospheric circulations miao et al 2019 chen and zhai 2016 reported that ppe events are most likely to induce by the interaction of several key and long term circulation anomalies these ppe events can easily trigger disasters like flooding landslide and debris flow easterling 2000 chen and zhai 2013 with long duration and great intensity the ppe events in ca usually occur in rainy season and have destructive impacts although some sub regions in ca ppe events do not increase significantly the high frequency in several special years can have serious impacts one ppe event known as 7 17 in 2007 xinjiang main characteristics of this precipitation extreme weather process are high intensity long duration and wide influence range the daily precipitation in six meteorological stations broke the record and ranked the second in history this event lead to enormous economy losses and casualties wang et al 2011 therefore in arid and semi arid ca where ecosystems are fragile lands are barren and concurrently includes mountain areas such precipitation extreme events deserve more attentions 3 5 the related physical mechanisms 3 5 1 impacts of water vapor to explore the possible causes of summer precipitation and precipitation extreme in ca we further discuss the distribution patterns and variation of water vapor transport for the period of 1979 2018 the climatological mean water vapor input in ca mainly transported by prevailing westerlies from the western boundary huang et al 2013 yatagai 2003 and the second is from northern boundary in fig 10 a four boundaries summer vertical water vapor fluxes have been calculated from the surface to 300 hpa during the study period in the western boundary vertically integrated water vapor is about 0 26 106 kg s 1 the northern boundary also act as transfer passage and the vertically integrated water vapor is about 0 11 106kg s 1 the main output occurs in the eastern boundary and the magnitude is 0 46 106 kg s 1 besides water vapor exports in the south boundary is about 0 19 106 kg s 1 fig 10b e present the vertically integrated water vapor anomalies in different boundaries from 1979 to 2018 significant decreasing in water vapor outputs from the southern and eastern boundary have been detected the abrupt mann kendall test indicates that significant decreasing in southern and eastern boundaries in 1998 and which consists with increasing summer precipitation and precipitation extreme in table 2 further discussion about the correlation between precipitation index and each boundary water vapor transport are exhibited the impact of water vapor from four directions at different regions on the tsp and precipitation extreme in ca are further discussed and the results are shown in fig 11 in general tsp and precipitation extreme in ca are positively correlated with water vapor transported by the westerlies especially in sca and tsm because ca is located in the core region of the westerlies chen et al 2008a the five sub regions generally show negative correlations with the water vapor transport in the eastern boundary and the correlations are not significant the water vapor transport in northern bound is positively correlated with tsp and precipitation extremes in nkz region though the correlations are not significant the south boundary shows a significant negative correlation in nkz and stm and has unobvious positive correlation in other regions combined the significantly decreased water vapor transport in the southern and eastern boundaries of ca in fig 10c and 10e the increasing tsp and precipitation extreme in nkz and stm regions is closely related to the decrease of water vapor output in the southern boundary we further reveal the distribution patterns of water vapor flux anomalies for the periods 1979 1997 and 1998 2018 in fig 12 a an anomalous anti cyclonic circulation was present in the middle ca accompanying strong anomalous cyclonic over the east europe and over the novosibirsk which induces northwesterly water vapor flux anomalies occurred over eastern ca during the period 1979 1997 the southern boundary dominated by the northerly wind and act as water vapor outlet on the contrary after 1998 an anomalous cyclonic in the middle ca combined with two abnormal anticyclones on its both sides and anomalous water vapor transports from the arabian sea to ca in fig 12b recent work has shown that precipitation in ca is influenced by el niño southern oscillation enso hu et al 2019 detected significant correlations between enso and the precipitation in ca especially during el niño years previous research found enso sst anomalies induce atmospheric anomalies via rossby wave train arching from the pacific into the atlantic region and an extension of the enso induced trough over the european promotes positive precipitation anomalies buli and kucharski 2012 besides in previous works warming of the indian ocean is regarded as part of the el niño signal kug and kang 2006 which has significant impacts on precipitation extremes by anomalous water vapor transmission gao et al 2017 enso induced low pressure anomalies increased the precipitation in ca by strengthening the westerly and southwesterly water vapor respectively from the north atlantic ocean and indian ocean to ca chen et al 2018 hu et al 2019 in addition wang et al 2010 exhibited that the caspian seas are also closely related with the precipitation in ca by adjusting westerly water vapor in summary the increase of tsp and precipitation extreme in ca show more close relationship with abnormal water vapor input from the southern boundary which may relate to enso signal the ocean influences on precipitation and precipitation extremes in ca should be noticeable and need more exploration in future we compare the moisture budget in different sub regions for two distinct periods during 1979 1997 and 1998 2018 precipitation change is balanced by the changes of thermodynamic components evaporation dynamic and residual term lin et al 2014 climatological mean precipitation in ca is mainly adjusted by evaporation vertical and horizontal moisture advection and residual terms the magnitude of the residual terms probable contact with complex topography and land surface processes bao and you 2019 in sca precipitation scarcely changes in the two periods in fig 13 a as there are more deserts in this region local water vapor changes less evaporation is greater and subsidence is prevailing in nkz precipitation obviously increases after 1998 in fig 13b as evidently vertical ascending moisture advection and slightly positive horizontal moisture advection besides local moisture are decreased which indicates that airborne moisture is partly transformed into precipitation in nkz the precipitation in sex is slightly decreased which related to the decreased horizontal moisture advection and increased residual terms in wca precipitation reduced after 1998 accompanying with decreasing horizontal vertical moisture advection and increased residual terms in fig 13d precipitation increased in tsm after 1998 in fig 13e is primarily contributed by the significantly positive vertical moisture advection and decreased residual term moisture budget anomalies in nkz and tsm conducive to enhance the precipitation as high correlation between tsp and precipitation extreme in ca the influence factors of precipitation also play a regulatory role in precipitation extreme events 3 5 2 large scale circulation anomaly the distribution patterns of geopotential height anomalies at 200 hpa for the periods 1979 1997 and 1998 2018 are investigated in fig 14 the geopotential height center anomalies over eastern europe and novosibirsk oppositely changed and anomalies negative center in ca strengthened after 1998 the geopotential height anomalies at 200 hpa is consistent with the negative phase of ea wr in fig 14c a significant decreasing trend in the ea wr exhibits which indicates it convert to negative pattern and the mann kendall test found that abrupt decrease year of ea wr is 1999 subsequently table 3 shows tsp and precipitation extreme indices are negatively correlated with the ea wr in 1979 2018 the tsp r90tot rx1day r90fre r10mm and cwd are significantly negative correlated with the ea wr respectively 0 43 0 49 0 42 0 48 0 55 and 0 52 above 99 confidence level besides the frequency of ppe also negatively correlated with ea wr and the correlation coefficient is 0 37 above 95 confidence level a comprehensive analysis of the spatial patterns of correlation coefficients in ca is further shown in fig 14 d negative geopotential height anomaly and a cyclonic anomaly exhibit at 500 hpa over northern ca in addition in cooperation with the positive geopotential height and the anti cyclonic anomalies over mongolia the southerly winds in the arabian sea are guided to eastern ca additionally the 560 hpa geopotential height contour is employed to be in half of the trough in northern ca it is worth noting that the trough significantly southwardly deepened after 1998 thus when the ea wr turns to negative pattern after 1999 it induces anomaly negative geopotential height over ca and positive geopotential height over mongolia to deepens the trough in northern ca and accompanies with anomalous south moisture transport to east ca provides favorable conditions for precipitation and extreme precipitation increasing especially in nkz and tsm 4 discussion and conclusions the primary purpose of this study is to investigate spatiotemporal variations of summer precipitation and precipitation extreme in ca from 1979 to 2018 using high resolution cpc daily precipitation data firstly different extreme precipitation indices are defined to quantify the intensity frequency and persistence of precipitation extreme events in ca then reof technique is conducted to study regional variations we also explored possible physical mechanisms related to the subsequent trend of precipitation and precipitation extreme the main results are summarized below 1 the tsp and precipitation extreme in ca generally exhibit a meridional gradient and larger magnitudes occur to the north of 50 n and in the tienshan mountain range additionally rx1day also exhibits larger values in south xinjiang the precipitation extreme indices are strongly positive correlated with tsp the tsp and precipitation extreme have decadal increasing trends during 1979 2018 and abrupt increased after 1998 furthermore the proportion of summer precipitation extreme in the tsp also increased 2 for the sub regions in ca the nkz and tsm have shown distinct increasing trends in the tsp and precipitation extreme from 1979 to 2018 in contrast sca shows indistinct decreasing trends 3 ppe events also occur in arid and semiarid ca in the nkz and stm significant increasing trends also reveal although other regions exhibit no significant trends such extreme events due to their intensity long duration and wide sphere could cause more serious disasters in the ca 4 this study also investigates the possible mechanisms for the increasing tsp and precipitation extreme in ca after 1998 the anomalous water vapor transport in the southern boundary of ca is significantly correlated with the increase of tsp and precipitation extreme meanwhile enhanced vertical moisture advection and tsm and increase horizontal moisture advection in nkz mainly contribute to the increasing of tsp and precipitation extreme in these regions 5 the ea wr pattern is negatively correlated tsp and precipitation extreme indices in ca in 1979 2018 and turns to negative phase after 1999 the negative ea wr phase induces abnormal negative geopotential height in ca and deepens the trough in northern ca which cooperates with the northward water vapor transport and ascending motion in nkz and tsm establishes favorable conditions for precipitation and precipitation extreme in summary our study exhibits both summer precipitation and precipitation extreme spatiotemporal features in the ca during the last forty years we also firstly analyzed ppe events in ca and the possible physical processes through moisture conditions and large scale circulation aspects have been discussed the aforementioned conclusions are based on climatological background explanations from synoptic aspect also have discussed in reference figs 4 and 5 the composite of 10 precipitation extreme events simultaneously happened in the nkz and tsm confirm that the synoptic scale convergence movement and the vertical ascending motion are reinforced from the composite map at 850 hpa in reference fig 4 we can see that anomalous cyclone center in ca and gradually strengthened and moved eastward when it arrived northeast ca the anomalous cyclone leads the precipitation extreme in addition anomalous northerly wind guide water vapor into the north of kazakhstan while the anomalous southerly leads warm moisture transported to the southern xinjiang at the same time it can be seen from 500 hpa in reference fig 5 the negative ea wr pattern gradually moved to the southeast and when extreme precipitation occurred the anomalous cyclone center located in the northeast of ca the understanding of summer precipitation and precipitation extreme is refined in ca proposed in the literature hu et al 2017 huang et al 2013 xu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 2019 previous studies evidenced that both the anthropogenic and natural influence have been detected in increasing summer precipitation over ca peng et al 2018 wei et al 2016 song et al 2014 the temperature increasing in ca is more prominent than global average during latest decades moreover the warming in ca in the first 12 years of the 21st century is much stronger than previous decades and becomes the most outstanding climate variations hu et al 2014 this study emphasizes that the summer precipitation extreme in ca during 1979 2018 exhibit increasing trends especially in tsm and nkz the atmospheric water cycle has enhanced at the global and regional scales with the global warming bengtsson 2010 guo and wang 2014 bosilovich et al 2005 and xinjiang has been investigated that the hydrological cycle also shows significant intensifying with rapid warming and positively correlates to increased precipitation feng and wu 2016 yao et al 2020 under the aforementioned conditions warmer and wetter tendency are likely to continue in ca which may induce frequent precipitation extremes in the future the mechanism researches of precipitation extreme in ca is still rare exploring causes of precipitation and precipitation extreme changes in ca is still challenging and signality in climate statistics climate dynamics and numerical experiments more detail research in this field will be discussed in future credit authorship contribution
