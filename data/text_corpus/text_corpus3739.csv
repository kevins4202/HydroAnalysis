adopted as the electrically conductive membrane the biofouling formation on the pre treatment membrane was systematically analyzed and the results showed that both operation modes had obvious inhabitation on bacteria especially the capacitor mode exhibited stronger prevention capability on biomass accumulation than resistor mode nmds analysis of microbial communities further revealed that the anti biofouling effect mainly occurred on the membrane surface and gram positive biomarkers which can survive better in external electric field was distinctively found in capacitor mode through lefse analysis hypothesis was introduced to explain the anti fouling function of two modes that in the capacitor mode the competitive electrostatic repulsion of bacteria cells on negative electrode associated by the cell disruption effect of electro catalyzed reactive oxygen species ros generation while the anti fouling function of resistor mode was a result of temperature increment on membrane

introduction membrane distillation md is an energy efficient technology for advanced treatment of wastewater brackish water and seawater deionization with a high quality of permeate menachem and phillip 2011 tijing et al 2015 however membrane fouling is one of the most problematic issues which cause membrane pores blocking pores wetting leading decreases of flux and permeate contamination such problem would eventually result in higher operating cost due to great energy consumption equipment downtime and demand for frequent membrane cleaning and replacement al obaidani et al 2008 biofouling is one type of membrane fouling that involved in md system although the occurrence of biofouling can be affected by the high temperature environment biofilms of some thermophilic strains are still possible to grow on membrane surface causing the blocking of membrane pores efficiency decrease in heat and mass transfer resulting in enhanced temperature polarization and flux drop bhojani et al 2018 bogler et al 2017 different from the pressure driven membrane process the morphology of md membrane biofilms was heterogeneous and contained several colonies while ro membrane biofilm was a homogeneous mat zodrow et al 2014 during the formation of biofilms in md microbial community succession was observed and this process can be divided into a three phase model including distinct colonization of microorganisms biofilm development and biofilm maturation liu et al 2019 additionally membrane wetting which facilitated the passage of ions bacteria cells and endospores through the membrane can be induced by biofouling leading to the contamination of permeates bogler and bar zeev 2018 membrane biofouling prevention is one of the key task for maintaining md performance which is mainly achieved by balancing pre treatment and membrane cleaning practices pretreatment technologies such as coagulation precipitation media filtration membrane filtration ph changes chlorination are available to mitigate biofouling tijing et al 2015 however these pretreatment methods are not always reliable as the use of chemical agent has been banned in most countries due to the introduction of toxicity to human beings and marine creatures champ 2003 kim and park 2016 the membrane cleaning including back flushing ultrasonic cleaning chemical cleaning is a remedial way to mitigate biofouling gryta 2008 although involves physical and chemical processes such method has its limitation when dealing with seriously bio fouled membrane where the biofilms are usually hard to remove wibisono et al 2015 additional the chemical agents used for pretreatment and membrane cleaning can damage the structure of membrane leading to a shorter lifetime guillen burrieza et al 2014 therefore it is necessary to seek for reliable anti fouling methods without the downsides of above mentioned conventional methods the electric field provides an attractive anti biofouling alternative from non chemical approaches piyadasa et al 2017 wang et al 2018 developed an antibacterial platform based on capacitive carbon doped tio2 nanotubes it was found that the positively charged surface showed adsorption and sterilization effect on bacteria among which gram negative bacteria had higher sensitivity to this effect pandit et al 2017 investigated the characteristics of biofouling in capacitive deionization system under different applied voltages revealing that the applied potentials can inhibit the growth of bacteria by altering the redox potential across their cell membranes also technologies such as pulsed electric field pef and magnetic electromagnetic field emf technologies showed effective non chemical anti biofouling effects which however were limited by the requirements of advanced facilities due to the higher electric frequency in associated treatment modules piyadasa et al 2017 in recent years there is a growing interest in applying electrically conductive membrane to mitigate membrane fouling especial biofouling de lannoy et al 2013 thamaraiselvan et al 2018 these membranes were used in many water treatment process such as nf uf cdi ro ahmed et al 2016 duan et al 2014 and it was also reported in the md process ahmed et al 2017 fabricated an electrically conductive membrane by heat pressing a carbon cloth with electrospun pvdf hfp mat and applied it to detect membrane wetting dudchenko et al 2017 coated cnt pva on ptfe membrane in which the membrane flux was enhanced by joule heating effect although many works have been made few anti biofouling experiments with electrically conductive membrane were carried out for md process and most analysis were based on single bacteria for example de lannoy et al 2013 used pseudomonas aeruginosa as the model biofouling bacteria while few researches were based on the natural water in this study an electrically conductive membrane was developed by coating the polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane with carbon nanotube cnt and two novel anti biofouling systems were established in md system using the pre treatment membrane the anti biofouling property was evaluated by flux recording scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive spectrometer eds fluorescent staining of live dead cells and high throughput sequencing of dna and rna the mechanisms of two different anti biofouling modes were further verified by bioinformatics analysis reactive oxygen species ros detection and membrane temperature measuring this study characterized the anti biofouling property of electrically conductive membrane in md process investigated the mechanism of biofouling mitigation systematically and provided a potential choice for improving the reliability of membrane distillation process 2 materials and method 2 1 water collection surface water 100 l from xuanwu lake 32 4 25 4172 n 118 47 6 0612 e fig s1 was collected and used in the md system within 12 h after pretreation by a mesh film with the pore size of 50 μm to separate the large particle suspended solids from water 2 2 experiment setup a lab scale direct contact membrane distillation dcmd system was shown in fig 1a and s2 wherein dc power supplies korad 3005 p china were adopted in capacitor and resistor modes the temperature of water bath and cooler were set at 50 c and 15 c respectively feed and permeate were cycled by the peristaltic pumps longer bt100 2 china at the cross flow rate of 10 5 mm s the permeate flux was monitored by the balance and the conductivity of permeate was lower than 10 μs cm with a rejection over 99 normalized flux j j0 was used to monitor the fouling process where j was the instant flux and j0 was the initial flux measured at the open circuit condition the md module was consisted of two polymethyl methacrylate pmma plates a cnt ptfe membrane two titanium contacts and two spacers for the operation in capacitor mode an additional graphite plate was placed opposite the cnt ptfe membrane in the flow chamber to construct a capacitor system fig 1 b the cnt ptfe membrane was assembled between two pmma plates and spacers were placed on both sides of the membrane to ensure relatively unobstructed flow condition the md modules for resistor and control modes were assembled in the same structure as shown in fig 1b especially titanium contacts were placed at both ends of the membrane for the resistor mode while attached onto one end of membrane and graphite electrode respectively for the capacitor mode for the capacitor mode the applied voltage was 1 2 v with the circuit on off ratio of 9 min 1min and the membrane was charged by a constant voltage of 30 v in the resistor mode 2 3 analytical methods the variations of ph and conductivity in both feed and permeate sides were everyday measured hach hq40d america to measure the toc on the membrane surface 1 cm 1 cm fouled membrane was washed by 10 ml deionized water using sonicleaning and the water filtration through 0 45 μm was analyzed by a toc analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu japan the morphology of the membrane surface and cross section were investigated by sem zeiss evo18 germany eds bruker xflash6130 germany was further used to characterize the component of the foulants on the membrane the pore size of cnt layer and ptfe membrane were determined by brunauer emmett teller bet method woo et al 2016 using specific surface area pore size analyzer beishide 3h 2000ps1 china the contact angle measurement was implemented by a new method drop snake which was based on b spline snakes to shape the sessile drop stalder et al 2006 at the end of experiments the membrane samples were collected and stained immediately to analyze the ratio of live dead cells on the biofouling layer briefly the biofilms were stained with a solution of syto 9 and propidium iodide pi according to the manual filmtracer live dead biofilm viability kit invitrogen supplementary table s1 and further observed through confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm leica tcssp8 germany the intracellular ros were detected by dcfh da ros probe reactive oxygen species assay kit solarbio analyzed using a fluorescence microscope nikon eclipse 80i japan and the area of fluorescent region was measured using image pro plus 2 4 amplicon sequencing data processing and statistical analysis at the end of operation solution samples from bulk phase and raw water taken initially was filtered through 0 22 μm durapore membrane millipore gvwp and together with the membrane samples frozen at 80 c until extraction analysis methods of nucleic acid extraction data processing and statistical analysis were detailed described in section si 3 sequences found in this study were submitted to the sra database http www ncbi nlm nih gov under the project accession number srp179465 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of electrically conductive membranes an electrically conductive membrane fig 2 a was fabricated using layer by layer spray dudchenko et al 2017 coating the commercial carbon nanotube paste turing evolution china onto a hydrophobic ptfe membrane taoyuan medical and chemical factory china the membrane was dried at room temperature under a steady stream of air for over 24 h and stored until use the optimization of the cnt layer thickness was introduced in supplementary si 4 and the properties of cnt layer and ptfe membrane were listed in table s3 the cnt ptfe membrane showed a three layers structure as clearly observed in sem image fig 2b s3 including cnt layer ptfe membrane and 155 μm thick non woven fabric supporting layer nanoscale pores 0 02 μm characterized by bet method can be observed in cnt layers which were much smaller than the pore size of ptfe layer 0 22 μm conventionally hydrophobic membranes are used in md process to prevents liquid water and dissolved ions from passing through while the surface of cnt ptfe membrane was hydrophilic with a contact angle of 56 4 also the integration of hydrophilic hydrophobic membranes in md process has also been reported in recent studies where composite membranes with hydrophobic substrate and hydrophilic surface layers have been developed to mitigate membrane wetting wang et al 2016 wang and lin 2017 a preliminary experiment figs s4 5 was also conducted with 1 nacl solution for over 100 h and it was found that the conductivity of permeate was stabilized around 10 μs cm 1 during the whole process indicating that this cnt ptfe membrane is suitable for md process to analyze the performance of cnt layer when charged the current and voltage were monitored during the whole md process when operated in capacitor mode and resistor mode fig 2e f in the capacitor mode to mitigate the concentration polarization and water electrolysis the voltage of 1 2 v was applied with the circuit on off ratio of 9 min 1min noticeably the measured voltage showed quite different changing trend as operated with different feed solution the measured voltage dropped from 1 20 v to 0 00 v immediately when the feed solution was deionized water while the voltage gradually decreased from 1 20 v to around 0 55 v during the 1 min open circuit period when the feed solution was taken from xuanwu lake this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that when the electrode was charged and immersed in a conductive solution the interface of the charged electrode would be occupied with counter ions as a result of the coulomb force diminishing the charge hence the removal of coulomb force releases the held ions back to the solution jia and zhang 2016 in the resistor mode the current stabilized around 500 ma when operated with deionized water dw and after 12 h operation with dw raw water from xuanwu lake was used in the experiment the current increased to 524 ma and kept increasing with a peak of 548 ma after 5h operation then followed by a continuous declination the increase of current can be attributed to the replacement of dw with ionizable solution water from xuanwu lake when the cnt film was immersed in dw the electrons will only flow through the cnt film however if the cnt film was immersed in raw water from xuanwu lake the electrons can flow through two pathways through the cnt structure or through the ionized solution dudchenko et al 2017 the two pathways can be simplified as two parallel resistors leading to a lower resistance and a higher current in addition the conductivity of the cnt layer was enhanced as the feed solution infiltrated into the hydrophilic cnt layer which might cause the increment of current with the extension of operation time foulants would accumulate on the membrane leading to the increment of resistance and thus the decrement of the current 3 2 high throughput sequencing of the md system 3 2 1 analysis of the total dna and active rna microbial community to investigate the formation of biofouling layer and the changes of microbial community samples were divided into four groups including raw water group raw dna raw rna capacitor group ca m dna ca m rna ca f dna ca f rna control group co m dna co m rna co f dna co f rna and resistor group re m dna re m rna re f dna re f rna and high throughput sequencings of 16s rdna and 16s rrna were conducted it was reported that 16s rdna sequence both dead and live bacteria while rna target live members of microbial community bajaj et al 2018 li et al 2017 the microbial community structure of total dna and active rna communities at genus level are shown in fig 3a and s6 in which significant difference were observed between raw water and md samples for the raw water group cyanobium pcc 6307 was the predominate genus with the proportion of 35 2 and 67 9 in dna and rna based samples respectively and it cannot be found in md samples in comparison some bacteria such as meiothermus enriched in dna samples methyloversatilis novosphingobium and nannocystaceae uncultured enriched in dna and rna samples were found abundant in md samples meiothermus was one of the most representative genera in the raw water almost no meiothermus can be observed in both dna and rna samples while for the md samples meiothermus was the predominant genus in all the dna samples and specially the abundances of meiothermus in resistor group 40 9 42 1 were significantly higher than those of the control group and capacitor group 12 0 18 1 and 9 9 15 6 respectively tracing the data to the species level silvanus species took the largest proportion of over 99 0 in genus meiothermus which was reported to be a thermophilic biofilm forming bacteria that was found in hot spring with an optimum growth temperature of about 55 c tenreiro et al 1995 as the operating temperature of md process was about 50 c the thermophilic bacteria which can survive and grow in the high temperature environment were predicted to be enriched in the md system in the resistor group the electrically conductive membrane can raise the temperature of membrane surface and feed solution with joule heating leading to a higher proportion of the meiothermus to verify this assumption temperature of the membrane surface was measured by a temperature sensitive material in section 3 4 however compared with the total microbial community dna the abundance of meiothermus was much lower in the active microbial community rna suggesting that meiothermus was a predominate genus only in the early stage of md process and it cannot survival after a long time operation a recent research further found that silvanus does not grow with 1 or more nacl sikorski et al 2010 with the extension of operation time the salinity of feed solution kept increasing leading to higher salinity of the feed in subsequent operation the salinity might reach an inhibition concentration for meiothermus metabolism and result in low abundance among the active microbial community methyloversatilis a gram negative betaproteobacteria oren 2014 enriched in both dna and rna based samples was another bacterium that worth analyzing as it was found in abundance only in control group and resistor group 3 8 14 6 and 3 9 18 4 for control group and resistor group respectively the abundance of methyloversatilis in capacitor group was less than 0 7 in both dna and rna samples representing that the operation can inhibit the growth of this kind of bacteria through the whole process except the difference of microbial community among these modes the abundance of some bacteria also showed diverse distribution between membrane samples and bulk phase samples novosphingobium and nannocystaceae uncultured which can be found in both total and active community were two representative bacteria of different living patterns novosphingobium was a free living alphaproteobacteria islam et al 2010 smit et al 2012 which tended to live in the bulk phase instead of attaching to the membrane surface and nannocystaceae uncultured was reported to be the biofilm forming bacteria rud et al 2017 thus it was reasonable that novosphingobium showed a higher abundance in the bulk phase samples 3 3 40 7 than membrane samples 0 1 4 6 and nannocystaceae uncultured was observed mostly in the membrane samples 8 5 19 4 in addition almost no nannocystaceae uncultured was observed in the resistor group and this phenomenon might be attributed to the higher temperature on the membrane surface due to the effect of joule heating 3 2 2 analysis of anti bacteria properties based on nmds the non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds which calculates distances between samples based on phylogenetic relatedness of the observed otus was used to quantify the effectiveness of anti biofouling fig 3 b it was not surprising that there was a large distance between raw water and the md samples as the md samples were operated in a higher temperature for over 270 h for the samples from membrane control group had the shortest distance between dna sample and rna sample 0 05 while the distance in capacitor group and resistor group were much larger 0 09 and 0 23 respectively in comparison for the samples from bulk phase distance between total microbial community and active microbial community was 0 06 0 11 and 0 07 for control capacitor and resistor modes respectively as the distance represented the difference between total microbial community and the active microbial community the nmds analysis clearly revealed that the anti biofouling effect mainly occurred on the cnt ptfe membrane surface 3 2 3 lefse analysis based on dna data to determine the classified bacterial taxa with significant abundance differences among the three groups we performed biomarker analysis using the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse method and 27 bacterial clades present statistically significant difference with a lda threshold of 3 5 as shown in the lefse cladogram fig 3c the phylum actinobacteria a large group of gram positive bacteria stevenson 2008 was one of the most significant biomarkers according to the bar chart of lda score fig 3d most bacteria were significantly enriched in capacitor groups 15 clades while only 4 clades showed abundance advantage in resistor group and 8 clades in control group four biomarkers with higher lda score in the capacitor group were bryobacter genera solibacteraceae subgroup3 family solibacterales order acidobacteriia class and all the four biomarkers were belonged to acidobacteriia class considering the higher lda score of acidobacteriia and more biomarkers in actinobacteria phylum actinobacteria gram positive and class acidobacteriia gram negative can be regarded as the most important biomarkers in capacitor group in comparison control group was mainly enriched by members of armatimonadetes phylum fimbriimonadaceae family fimbriimonadia class fimbriimonadales order polyangium genus haliscomenobacter genus curvibacter genus bdellovibrio genus and all the enriched bacterial were gram negative ding and yokota 2004 im et al 2012 reichenbach and dworkin 2013 sockett and lambert 2004 similarly the four biomarkers in resistor group were also gram negatively based on the above analysis lefse clearly indicated that the biomarkers were quite different among these three groups wherein the gram positive biomarkers appeared only in capacitor group such phenomenon in capacitor group was mainly resulted from the effect of electric field and the mechanism will be detailed discussed in section 3 4 additionally class acidimicrobiia gram positive which was attributed to acidophilic bacteria hu et al 2018 took the largest proportion of over 60 in phylum actinobacteria another important biomarker of acidobacteria with acidophilic feature was also observed in capacitor group although it was gram negative bacteria to explain the enrichment of acidimicrobiia and acidobacteria in capacitor mode an assumption was proposed that both the positively charged surface and the h can be regarded as the electron acceptors and these acidophilic bacteria which were regarded as the electron donor has better resistance to electron loss than other bacteria therefore the better survival advantage of acidophilic bacteria can also prove that the charged surface and electric field contributed to the anti biofouling process 3 3 the evaluation of anti fouling properties 3 3 1 sem eds analysis of fouled membranes the morphology and composition of the fouling layer was studied using sem eds fig 4 a f the membrane surface morphology in capacitor mode was quite different from other modes in which significant inorganic scaling was observed comparatively the fouling layers in resistor and control modes were mainly composed of organic matters and microorganisms fig s7 as the toc on the membrane surface was 7 8 1 4 36 2 3 1 23 3 4 3 μg cm2 for capacitor mode control mode and resistor respectively for the capacitor mode when an electrical voltage is applied across the cell ions in the spacer channel are transported towards the electrodes and adsorbed in the electrical double layers zhao et al 2013 leading to the concentration polarization and severe scaling on the membrane surface eds investigations of the membrane samples confirmed the formation of large amounts of caco3 deposit fig 4d the fouled surface in capacitor mode displayed more ca element with a total intensity of 28 1 cps kev compared to control mode of 1 3 cps kev and resistor mode of 1 0 cps kev additionally the ca ions can penetrate into the cnt layer under the effect of electric field in capacitor mode but the ptfe membrane can effectively block it from permeating to the cold side leading to the accumulation of ca and the formation of caco3 scaling in the cnt layer fig s8 except the ca the si element also exhibited different intensity among samples in which its intensity in capacitor mode control mode and resistor mode were 4 5 cps kev 25 2 cps kev 17 8 cps kev respectively the fewer si element in capacitor mode can be attributed to the characteristics of natural silicate with negative charges ariffin et al 2014 yilmaz and yilmaz 2010 and the like charges will repel each other reducing the adhesion on the negatively charged cnt ptfe membrane 3 3 2 biofilm formation in different operation modes to characterize the anti biofouling property in different operation modes the quantification of microorganisms in water was shown in fig s9 and the biofilm components on the cnt ptfe membrane surface were characterized using a clsm fig 4h j and s10 on the membrane surface the biovolume of three modes were significantly different p value 0 01 for both live cells and dead cells the capacitor mode had the lowest total biovolume 4 0 μm3 μm2 while the highest total biovolume was observed in the control mode 10 8 μm3 μm2 the biovolume of dead cells exceeded that of live cells for all the operation modes but control mode showed a much higher ratio of live dead cells 0 07 0 88 0 06 for capacitor mode control mode and resistor mode respectively suggesting the two anti biofouling mode with charged cnt ptfe membrane can inhibit biofouling effectively for the capacitor mode an external electric field was exerted across the flow chamber and a hypothesis of the anti biofouling mechanism was stress response which can generate free radicals that hamper normal metabolic activities and disrupt cell organelles pandit et al 2017 the potential difference among the bacteria cnt ptfe membrane and graphite plate inspired electrons transfer inducing ros burst leading to the death of bacteria wang et al 2018 for the resistor mode the cnt layer can provide joule heating elevating the membrane temperature creating a less favorable surface for bacteria details of the anti biofouling mechanism related to ros generation and the joule heating effect will be further discussed in section 3 4 additionally great difference of morphology was observed between capacitor and resistor modes visualized in fig 4h j wherein the density of the biomass in resistor group was much higher than that in capacitor group considering the negative charge of microorganisms gottenbos et al 2001 the negatively charged cnt ptfe membrane would greatly inhibit the adhesion of such kind bacteria finally causing a lower biofilm density 3 3 3 impact of two anti biofouling modes on md performance during the whole dcmd experiment the conductivity of permeates were around 10 μs cm fig s11 but dramatically different filtration performance was observed among three operation modes fig 4k with normalized flux j j0 as fouling index the flux of commercial ptfe membranes was 14 01 0 82 l m2 h additionally the initial flux j0 for cnt ptfe membrane that measured at the open circuit condition was 12 90 13 01 and 13 23 l m2 h for resistor control and capacitor modes respectively at the initial stage a higher water flux of 14 60 l m2 h around 10 increment was observed under resistor mode while no significant changes were detected in other two modes this phenomenon can be attributed to the higher voltage in resistor mode as the joule heating effect can rise the temperature of water leading to a higher vapor pressure to confirm this explanation an experiment was conducted to measure the flux before and after cnt ptfe membrane was electrified fig s12 with the extension of operation time the flux of both capacitor mode and resistor mode showed a trend of liner decreasing with the decline rate of 0 23 h and 0 32 h respectively while for the control mode the decline rate was up to 0 59 h after 45 h operation although similar trends of flux drop were observed between capacitor mode and resistor mode the fouling patterns were quite different considering the sem eds analysis organic fouling and caco3 scaling were the major fouling composite in capacitor mode while the flux drop in resistor mode was resulted from organic fouling silicate fouling and the decrease of electric current the sem eds analysis together with clsm analysis further revealed that organic fouling silicate fouling and biofouling co occurred in control mode leading to the most severe flux drop after 225 h the normalized fluxes of the three modes stabilize with the decline rate of less than 0 12 h at the end of the process the normalized flux of control mode decreased to 18 5 but its value still remained higher than 40 4 in capacitor mode and 35 5 in resistor mode respectively representing that these two anti fouling modes can enhance the membrane performance effectively in regard of the nmds analysis of microbial community section 3 2 2 it can be seen that both capacitor and resistor modes showed an especial property of bacteria killing which will be detailed discussed in the following section 3 4 the mechanism of the two anti biofouling modes as stated above both capacitor mode and resistor mode can mitigate biofouling effectively although their anti biofouling behavior was quite different recently the anti biofouling mechanism of electrically conductive membrane was investigated by researchers asadi and torkaman 2014 jiménez sánchez et al 2017 vecitis et al 2011 and can be explained by direct oxidation indirect oxidation coulomb repulsion and joule heating direct oxidation means the charged surface can damage the cell membrane structure directly while indirect oxidation refers to the generation of free chlorine and reactive oxygen species which can lead to a degradation of cell membrane coulomb repulsion can drag the charged particles or bacteria and thus prevent the adhesion of bacteria on membrane surface joule heating may be considered as a thermal treatment and bacterial cell inactivation with joule heating would occur when the temperature was over 50 c in the capacitor mode electric field was developed between cnt ptfe membrane and graphite plate while for the resistor mode the electric field was mostly formed in the cnt layer due to the different distribution of electric field and applied voltage enormous electrons transfer from bacteria to charged surface only occurred in capacitor mode while obvious joule heating effect happened in resistor mode fig 5 in the capacitor mode as most bacteria carried a net negative surface charge they will tend to adhere to the positively charged graphite plate instead of cnt ptfe membrane causing a lowest level of biomass on the cnt ptfe membrane among three modes the positively charged surfaces also exert an anti microbial effect on adhered gram negative bacteria gottenbos et al 2001 which was verified by the lefse analysis section 3 2 3 and microbial community structure analysis section 3 2 1 additionally the electric field will cause the electrons transfer from bacteria to the positively charged surface inducing the burst of ros distorting the bacteria shape especially the gram negative bacteria which has a thinner cell membrane busscher et al 2006 shockman and barren 1983 and leading to the death finally ros are regarded as highly reactive cytotoxic molecules formed by the incomplete one electron reduction of o and some environmental stressors may also cause endogenous ros generation leading to the oxidation of biomolecules cabiscol català et al 2000 lemire et al 2013 excess ros generation might be occurred in response to external electric field or abrupt changes in temperature imlay 2013 pandit et al 2017 ros on the membrane surface was detected quantitatively fig 5 fig s13 using fluorescence microscope and results showed that capacitor mode has the highest ros activity with the ratio of fluorescent area up to 18 85 while few ros was observed in control mode and resistor mode as the ratio of fluorescent area was 0 50 and 0 37 respectively it was reasonable that large amount of ros was generated in the capacitor mode due to the existence of external electric field comparatively the production of ros was much lower at the end of the operation for control mode and resistor mode as abrupt changes in temperature occurred only in the initial stage of md process and the bacteria can gradually adapt to this condition compared with capacitor group the applied voltage in resistor group was much higher but almost no electric field was formed between the graphite electrode and cnt ptfe membrane the production of joule heating would elevate the temperature of cnt layer providing more environment stress to the bacteria and thus mitigating the biofouling the surface of membrane has the relatively lower temperature than bulk solution due to temperature polarization shakaib et al 2012 zodrow et al 2014 while the joule heating significantly increases the temperature of membrane surface to evaluate the joule heating process a temperature measuring approach was developed using temperature sensitive materials fig 5 and s14 for the yellow temperature sensitive layer the colour started to change at 44 c then completely faded when the temperature was higher than 50 c in comparison the colour changing point for red layer was about 63 c as shown in the video and fig s14 both layers showed their original colour at the open circuit condition while the yellow layer faded when charged with the voltage of 30 v this phenomenon indicated that the temperature of membrane surface was lower than the bulk phase in the control mode while joule heating could significantly increase the membrane temperature from lower than 44 c to over 50 c in resistor mode considering the higher abundance of thermophilic bacteria in the total microbial community section 3 2 1 it was reasonable that the resistor mode can inhibit the growth of some bacteria by elevating membrane temperature the rise of membrane temperature was an important factor of the anti biofouling phenomenon but maybe not the only reason the direct degradation of bacteria might also be contributed to the anti biofouling effect vecitis et al 2011 constructed a filtration system which was similar to our resistor mode md system with e coli as the model biofouling bacteria the results showed that this system can inactivate bacteria efficiently and the direct oxidation of bacteria was the main anti biofouling function however different from this research the feed solution in our study was natural water and the operation time was much longer which means the microbial community was quite complex thus the phenomenon of direct oxidation was hard to characterize in further researches we will pay more attention to the mechanism research of resistor mode with an especial focus on direct oxidation 4 conclusion in this study an electrically conductive membrane was developed and two novel anti biofouling modes were constructed using such membranes the performances of two modes were systematically analyzed and the results led to the following conclusions 1 both capacitor mode and resistor mode had obvious inhabitation on bacteria especially the capacitor mode exhibited stronger prevention capability on biomass accumulation than resistor mode 2 microbial community succession occurred during the process and the community structures were quite different at the end of the operation 3 the competitive electrostatic adsorption of bacteria cells on positive electrode associated by the cell disruption effect of electro catalyzed ros generation contributed to the anti biofouling function in capacitor mode and the inactivation of bacteria in resistor mode was a result of temperature increment on membrane surface caused by joule heating effects acknowledge this study was mainly financially supported by national natural science foundation of china grant number 51508153 fundamental research

18695,this study evaluated the anti biofouling efficacy of capacitor mode and resistor mode in membrane distillation md polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane coated with carbon nanotube cnt was

inhabitation on bacteria especially the capacitor mode exhibited stronger prevention capability on biomass accumulation than resistor mode nmds analysis of microbial communities further revealed that the anti biofouling effect mainly occurred on the membrane surface and gram positive biomarkers which can survive better in external electric field was distinctively found in capacitor mode through lefse analysis hypothesis was introduced to explain the anti fouling function of two modes that in the capacitor mode the competitive electrostatic repulsion of bacteria cells on negative electrode associated by the cell disruption effect of electro catalyzed reactive oxygen species ros generation while the anti fouling function of resistor mode was a result of temperature increment on membrane

introduction membrane distillation md is an energy efficient technology for advanced treatment of wastewater brackish water and seawater deionization with a high quality of permeate menachem and phillip 2011 tijing et al 2015 however membrane fouling is one of the most problematic issues which cause membrane pores blocking pores wetting leading decreases of flux and permeate contamination such problem would eventually result in higher operating cost due to great energy consumption equipment downtime and demand for frequent membrane cleaning and replacement al obaidani et al 2008 biofouling is one type of membrane fouling that involved in md system although the occurrence of biofouling can be affected by the high temperature environment biofilms of some thermophilic strains are still possible to grow on membrane surface causing the blocking of membrane pores efficiency decrease in heat and mass transfer resulting in enhanced temperature polarization and flux drop bhojani et al 2018 bogler et al 2017 different from the pressure driven membrane process the morphology of md membrane biofilms was heterogeneous and contained several colonies while ro membrane biofilm was a homogeneous mat zodrow et al 2014 during the formation of biofilms in md microbial community succession was observed and this process can be divided into a three phase model including distinct colonization of microorganisms biofilm development and biofilm maturation liu et al 2019 additionally membrane wetting which facilitated the passage of ions bacteria cells and endospores through the membrane can be induced by biofouling leading to the contamination of permeates bogler and bar zeev 2018 membrane biofouling prevention is one of the key task for maintaining md performance which is mainly achieved by balancing pre treatment and membrane cleaning practices pretreatment technologies such as coagulation precipitation media filtration membrane filtration ph changes chlorination are available to mitigate biofouling tijing et al 2015 however these pretreatment methods are not always reliable as the use of chemical agent has been banned in most countries due to the introduction of toxicity to human beings and marine creatures champ 2003 kim and park 2016 the membrane cleaning including back flushing ultrasonic cleaning chemical cleaning is a remedial way to mitigate biofouling gryta 2008 although involves physical and chemical processes such method has its limitation when dealing with seriously bio fouled membrane where the biofilms are usually hard to remove wibisono et al 2015 additional the chemical agents used for pretreatment and membrane cleaning can damage the structure of membrane leading to a shorter lifetime guillen burrieza et al 2014 therefore it is necessary to seek for reliable anti fouling methods without the downsides of above mentioned conventional methods the electric field provides an attractive anti biofouling alternative from non chemical approaches piyadasa et al 2017 wang et al 2018 developed an antibacterial platform based on capacitive carbon doped tio2 nanotubes it was found that the positively charged surface showed adsorption and sterilization effect on bacteria among which gram negative bacteria had higher sensitivity to this effect pandit et al 2017 investigated the characteristics of biofouling in capacitive deionization system under different applied voltages revealing that the applied potentials can inhibit the growth of bacteria by altering the redox potential across their cell membranes also technologies such as pulsed electric field pef and magnetic electromagnetic field emf technologies showed effective non chemical anti biofouling effects which however were limited by the requirements of advanced facilities due to the higher electric frequency in associated treatment modules piyadasa et al 2017 in recent years there is a growing interest in applying electrically conductive membrane to mitigate membrane fouling especial biofouling de lannoy et al 2013 thamaraiselvan et al 2018 these membranes were used in many water treatment process such as nf uf cdi ro ahmed et al 2016 duan et al 2014 and it was also reported in the md process ahmed et al 2017 fabricated an electrically conductive membrane by heat pressing a carbon cloth with electrospun pvdf hfp mat and applied it to detect membrane wetting dudchenko et al 2017 coated cnt pva on ptfe membrane in which the membrane flux was enhanced by joule heating effect although many works have been made few anti biofouling experiments with electrically conductive membrane were carried out for md process and most analysis were based on single bacteria for example de lannoy et al 2013 used pseudomonas aeruginosa as the model biofouling bacteria while few researches were based on the natural water in this study an electrically conductive membrane was developed by coating the polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membrane with carbon nanotube cnt and two novel anti biofouling systems were established in md system using the pre treatment membrane the anti biofouling property was evaluated by flux recording scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive spectrometer eds fluorescent staining of live dead cells and high throughput sequencing of dna and rna the mechanisms of two different anti biofouling modes were further verified by bioinformatics analysis reactive oxygen species ros detection and membrane temperature measuring this study characterized the anti biofouling property of electrically conductive membrane in md process investigated the mechanism of biofouling mitigation systematically and provided a potential choice for improving the reliability of membrane distillation process 2 materials and method 2 1 water collection surface water 100 l from xuanwu lake 32 4 25 4172 n 118 47 6 0612 e fig s1 was collected and used in the md system within 12 h after pretreation by a mesh film with the pore size of 50 μm to separate the large particle suspended solids from water 2 2 experiment setup a lab scale direct contact membrane distillation dcmd system was shown in fig 1a and s2 wherein dc power supplies korad 3005 p china were adopted in capacitor and resistor modes the temperature of water bath and cooler were set at 50 c and 15 c respectively feed and permeate were cycled by the peristaltic pumps longer bt100 2 china at the cross flow rate of 10 5 mm s the permeate flux was monitored by the balance and the conductivity of permeate was lower than 10 μs cm with a rejection over 99 normalized flux j j0 was used to monitor the fouling process where j was the instant flux and j0 was the initial flux measured at the open circuit condition the md module was consisted of two polymethyl methacrylate pmma plates a cnt ptfe membrane two titanium contacts and two spacers for the operation in capacitor mode an additional graphite plate was placed opposite the cnt ptfe membrane in the flow chamber to construct a capacitor system fig 1 b the cnt ptfe membrane was assembled between two pmma plates and spacers were placed on both sides of the membrane to ensure relatively unobstructed flow condition the md modules for resistor and control modes were assembled in the same structure as shown in fig 1b especially titanium contacts were placed at both ends of the membrane for the resistor mode while attached onto one end of membrane and graphite electrode respectively for the capacitor mode for the capacitor mode the applied voltage was 1 2 v with the circuit on off ratio of 9 min 1min and the membrane was charged by a constant voltage of 30 v in the resistor mode 2 3 analytical methods the variations of ph and conductivity in both feed and permeate sides were everyday measured hach hq40d america to measure the toc on the membrane surface 1 cm 1 cm fouled membrane was washed by 10 ml deionized water using sonicleaning and the water filtration through 0 45 μm was analyzed by a toc analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu japan the morphology of the membrane surface and cross section were investigated by sem zeiss evo18 germany eds bruker xflash6130 germany was further used to characterize the component of the foulants on the membrane the pore size of cnt layer and ptfe membrane were determined by brunauer emmett teller bet method woo et al 2016 using specific surface area pore size analyzer beishide 3h 2000ps1 china the contact angle measurement was implemented by a new method drop snake which was based on b spline snakes to shape the sessile drop stalder et al 2006 at the end of experiments the membrane samples were collected and stained immediately to analyze the ratio of live dead cells on the biofouling layer briefly the biofilms were stained with a solution of syto 9 and propidium iodide pi according to the manual filmtracer live dead biofilm viability kit invitrogen supplementary table s1 and further observed through confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm leica tcssp8 germany the intracellular ros were detected by dcfh da ros probe reactive oxygen species assay kit solarbio analyzed using a fluorescence microscope nikon eclipse 80i japan and the area of fluorescent region was measured using image pro plus 2 4 amplicon sequencing data processing and statistical analysis at the end of operation solution samples from bulk phase and raw water taken initially was filtered through 0 22 μm durapore membrane millipore gvwp and together with the membrane samples frozen at 80 c until extraction analysis methods of nucleic acid extraction data processing and statistical analysis were detailed described in section si 3 sequences found in this study were submitted to the sra database http www ncbi nlm nih gov under the project accession number srp179465 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of electrically conductive membranes an electrically conductive membrane fig 2 a was fabricated using layer by layer spray dudchenko et al 2017 coating the commercial carbon nanotube paste turing evolution china onto a hydrophobic ptfe membrane taoyuan medical and chemical factory china the membrane was dried at room temperature under a steady stream of air for over 24 h and stored until use the optimization of the cnt layer thickness was introduced in supplementary si 4 and the properties of cnt layer and ptfe membrane were listed in table s3 the cnt ptfe membrane showed a three layers structure as clearly observed in sem image fig 2b s3 including cnt layer ptfe membrane and 155 μm thick non woven fabric supporting layer nanoscale pores 0 02 μm characterized by bet method can be observed in cnt layers which were much smaller than the pore size of ptfe layer 0 22 μm conventionally hydrophobic membranes are used in md process to prevents liquid water and dissolved ions from passing through while the surface of cnt ptfe membrane was hydrophilic with a contact angle of 56 4 also the integration of hydrophilic hydrophobic membranes in md process has also been reported in recent studies where composite membranes with hydrophobic substrate and hydrophilic surface layers have been developed to mitigate membrane wetting wang et al 2016 wang and lin 2017 a preliminary experiment figs s4 5 was also conducted with 1 nacl solution for over 100 h and it was found that the conductivity of permeate was stabilized around 10 μs cm 1 during the whole process indicating that this cnt ptfe membrane is suitable for md process to analyze the performance of cnt layer when charged the current and voltage were monitored during the whole md process when operated in capacitor mode and resistor mode fig 2e f in the capacitor mode to mitigate the concentration polarization and water electrolysis the voltage of 1 2 v was applied with the circuit on off ratio of 9 min 1min noticeably the measured voltage showed quite different changing trend as operated with different feed solution the measured voltage dropped from 1 20 v to 0 00 v immediately when the feed solution was deionized water while the voltage gradually decreased from 1 20 v to around 0 55 v during the 1 min open circuit period when the feed solution was taken from xuanwu lake this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that when the electrode was charged and immersed in a conductive solution the interface of the charged electrode would be occupied with counter ions as a result of the coulomb force diminishing the charge hence the removal of coulomb force releases the held ions back to the solution jia and zhang 2016 in the resistor mode the current stabilized around 500 ma when operated with deionized water dw and after 12 h operation with dw raw water from xuanwu lake was used in the experiment the current increased to 524 ma and kept increasing with a peak of 548 ma after 5h operation then followed by a continuous declination the increase of current can be attributed to the replacement of dw with ionizable solution water from xuanwu lake when the cnt film was immersed in dw the electrons will only flow through the cnt film however if the cnt film was immersed in raw water from xuanwu lake the electrons can flow through two pathways through the cnt structure or through the ionized solution dudchenko et al 2017 the two pathways can be simplified as two parallel resistors leading to a lower resistance and a higher current in addition the conductivity of the cnt layer was enhanced as the feed solution infiltrated into the hydrophilic cnt layer which might cause the increment of current with the extension of operation time foulants would accumulate on the membrane leading to the increment of resistance and thus the decrement of the current 3 2 high throughput sequencing of the md system 3 2 1 analysis of the total dna and active rna microbial community to investigate the formation of biofouling layer and the changes of microbial community samples were divided into four groups including raw water group raw dna raw rna capacitor group ca m dna ca m rna ca f dna ca f rna control group co m dna co m rna co f dna co f rna and resistor group re m dna re m rna re f dna re f rna and high throughput sequencings of 16s rdna and 16s rrna were conducted it was reported that 16s rdna sequence both dead and live bacteria while rna target live members of microbial community bajaj et al 2018 li et al 2017 the microbial community structure of total dna and active rna communities at genus level are shown in fig 3a and s6 in which significant difference were observed between raw water and md samples for the raw water group cyanobium pcc 6307 was the predominate genus with the proportion of 35 2 and 67 9 in dna and rna based samples respectively and it cannot be found in md samples in comparison some bacteria such as meiothermus enriched in dna samples methyloversatilis novosphingobium and nannocystaceae uncultured enriched in dna and rna samples were found abundant in md samples meiothermus was one of the most representative genera in the raw water almost no meiothermus can be observed in both dna and rna samples while for the md samples meiothermus was the predominant genus in all the dna samples and specially the abundances of meiothermus in resistor group 40 9 42 1 were significantly higher than those of the control group and capacitor group 12 0 18 1 and 9 9 15 6 respectively tracing the data to the species level silvanus species took the largest proportion of over 99 0 in genus meiothermus which was reported to be a thermophilic biofilm forming bacteria that was found in hot spring with an optimum growth temperature of about 55 c tenreiro et al 1995 as the operating temperature of md process was about 50 c the thermophilic bacteria which can survive and grow in the high temperature environment were predicted to be enriched in the md system in the resistor group the electrically conductive membrane can raise the temperature of membrane surface and feed solution with joule heating leading to a higher proportion of the meiothermus to verify this assumption temperature of the membrane surface was measured by a temperature sensitive material in section 3 4 however compared with the total microbial community dna the abundance of meiothermus was much lower in the active microbial community rna suggesting that meiothermus was a predominate genus only in the early stage of md process and it cannot survival after a long time operation a recent research further found that silvanus does not grow with 1 or more nacl sikorski et al 2010 with the extension of operation time the salinity of feed solution kept increasing leading to higher salinity of the feed in subsequent operation the salinity might reach an inhibition concentration for meiothermus metabolism and result in low abundance among the active microbial community methyloversatilis a gram negative betaproteobacteria oren 2014 enriched in both dna and rna based samples was another bacterium that worth analyzing as it was found in abundance only in control group and resistor group 3 8 14 6 and 3 9 18 4 for control group and resistor group respectively the abundance of methyloversatilis in capacitor group was less than 0 7 in both dna and rna samples representing that the operation can inhibit the growth of this kind of bacteria through the whole process except the difference of microbial community among these modes the abundance of some bacteria also showed diverse distribution between membrane samples and bulk phase samples novosphingobium and nannocystaceae uncultured which can be found in both total and active community were two representative bacteria of different living patterns novosphingobium was a free living alphaproteobacteria islam et al 2010 smit et al 2012 which tended to live in the bulk phase instead of attaching to the membrane surface and nannocystaceae uncultured was reported to be the biofilm forming bacteria rud et al 2017 thus it was reasonable that novosphingobium showed a higher abundance in the bulk phase samples 3 3 40 7 than membrane samples 0 1 4 6 and nannocystaceae uncultured was observed mostly in the membrane samples 8 5 19 4 in addition almost no nannocystaceae uncultured was observed in the resistor group and this phenomenon might be attributed to the higher temperature on the membrane surface due to the effect of joule heating 3 2 2 analysis of anti bacteria properties based on nmds the non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds which calculates distances between samples based on phylogenetic relatedness of the observed otus was used to quantify the effectiveness of anti biofouling fig 3 b it was not surprising that there was a large distance between raw water and the md samples as the md samples were operated in a higher temperature for over 270 h for the samples from membrane control group had the shortest distance between dna sample and rna sample 0 05 while the distance in capacitor group and resistor group were much larger 0 09 and 0 23 respectively in comparison for the samples from bulk phase distance between total microbial community and active microbial community was 0 06 0 11 and 0 07 for control capacitor and resistor modes respectively as the distance represented the difference between total microbial community and the active microbial community the nmds analysis clearly revealed that the anti biofouling effect mainly occurred on the cnt ptfe membrane surface 3 2 3 lefse analysis based on dna data to determine the classified bacterial taxa with significant abundance differences among the three groups we performed biomarker analysis using the linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse method and 27 bacterial clades present statistically significant difference with a lda threshold of 3 5 as shown in the lefse cladogram fig 3c the phylum actinobacteria a large group of gram positive bacteria stevenson 2008 was one of the most significant biomarkers according to the bar chart of lda score fig 3d most bacteria were significantly enriched in capacitor groups 15 clades while only 4 clades showed abundance advantage in resistor group and 8 clades in control group four biomarkers with higher lda score in the capacitor group were bryobacter genera solibacteraceae subgroup3 family solibacterales order acidobacteriia class and all the four biomarkers were belonged to acidobacteriia class considering the higher lda score of acidobacteriia and more biomarkers in actinobacteria phylum actinobacteria gram positive and class acidobacteriia gram negative can be regarded as the most important biomarkers in capacitor group in comparison control group was mainly enriched by members of armatimonadetes phylum fimbriimonadaceae family fimbriimonadia class fimbriimonadales order polyangium genus haliscomenobacter genus curvibacter genus bdellovibrio genus and all the enriched bacterial were gram negative ding and yokota 2004 im et al 2012 reichenbach and dworkin 2013 sockett and lambert 2004 similarly the four biomarkers in resistor group were also gram negatively based on the above analysis lefse clearly indicated that the biomarkers were quite different among these three groups wherein the gram positive biomarkers appeared only in capacitor group such phenomenon in capacitor group was mainly resulted from the effect of electric field and the mechanism will be detailed discussed in section 3 4 additionally class acidimicrobiia gram positive which was attributed to acidophilic bacteria hu et al 2018 took the largest proportion of over 60 in phylum actinobacteria another important biomarker of acidobacteria with acidophilic feature was also observed in capacitor group although it was gram negative bacteria to explain the enrichment of acidimicrobiia and acidobacteria in capacitor mode an assumption was proposed that both the positively charged surface and the h can be regarded as the electron acceptors and these acidophilic bacteria which were regarded as the electron donor has better resistance to electron loss than other bacteria therefore the better survival advantage of acidophilic bacteria can also prove that the charged surface and electric field contributed to the anti biofouling process 3 3 the evaluation of anti fouling properties 3 3 1 sem eds analysis of fouled membranes the morphology and composition of the fouling layer was studied using sem eds fig 4 a f the membrane surface morphology in capacitor mode was quite different from other modes in which significant inorganic scaling was observed comparatively the fouling layers in resistor and control modes were mainly composed of organic matters and microorganisms fig s7 as the toc on the membrane surface was 7 8 1 4 36 2 3 1 23 3 4 3 μg cm2 for capacitor mode control mode and resistor respectively for the capacitor mode when an electrical voltage is applied across the cell ions in the spacer channel are transported towards the electrodes and adsorbed in the electrical double layers zhao et al 2013 leading to the concentration polarization and severe scaling on the membrane surface eds investigations of the membrane samples confirmed the formation of large amounts of caco3 deposit fig 4d the fouled surface in capacitor mode displayed more ca element with a total intensity of 28 1 cps kev compared to control mode of 1 3 cps kev and resistor mode of 1 0 cps kev additionally the ca ions can penetrate into the cnt layer under the effect of electric field in capacitor mode but the ptfe membrane can effectively block it from permeating to the cold side leading to the accumulation of ca and the formation of caco3 scaling in the cnt layer fig s8 except the ca the si element also exhibited different intensity among samples in which its intensity in capacitor mode control mode and resistor mode were 4 5 cps kev 25 2 cps kev 17 8 cps kev respectively the fewer si element in capacitor mode can be attributed to the characteristics of natural silicate with negative charges ariffin et al 2014 yilmaz and yilmaz 2010 and the like charges will repel each other reducing the adhesion on the negatively charged cnt ptfe membrane 3 3 2 biofilm formation in different operation modes to characterize the anti biofouling property in different operation modes the quantification of microorganisms in water was shown in fig s9 and the biofilm components on the cnt ptfe membrane surface were characterized using a clsm fig 4h j and s10 on the membrane surface the biovolume of three modes were significantly different p value 0 01 for both live cells and dead cells the capacitor mode had the lowest total biovolume 4 0 μm3 μm2 while the highest total biovolume was observed in the control mode 10 8 μm3 μm2 the biovolume of dead cells exceeded that of live cells for all the operation modes but control mode showed a much higher ratio of live dead cells 0 07 0 88 0 06 for capacitor mode control mode and resistor mode respectively suggesting the two anti biofouling mode with charged cnt ptfe membrane can inhibit biofouling effectively for the capacitor mode an external electric field was exerted across the flow chamber and a hypothesis of the anti biofouling mechanism was stress response which can generate free radicals that hamper normal metabolic activities and disrupt cell organelles pandit et al 2017 the potential difference among the bacteria cnt ptfe membrane and graphite plate inspired electrons transfer inducing ros burst leading to the death of bacteria wang et al 2018 for the resistor mode the cnt layer can provide joule heating elevating the membrane temperature creating a less favorable surface for bacteria details of the anti biofouling mechanism related to ros generation and the joule heating effect will be further discussed in section 3 4 additionally great difference of morphology was observed between capacitor and resistor modes visualized in fig 4h j wherein the density of the biomass in resistor group was much higher than that in capacitor group considering the negative charge of microorganisms gottenbos et al 2001 the negatively charged cnt ptfe membrane would greatly inhibit the adhesion of such kind bacteria finally causing a lower biofilm density 3 3 3 impact of two anti biofouling modes on md performance during the whole dcmd experiment the conductivity of permeates were around 10 μs cm fig s11 but dramatically different filtration performance was observed among three operation modes fig 4k with normalized flux j j0 as fouling index the flux of commercial ptfe membranes was 14 01 0 82 l m2 h additionally the initial flux j0 for cnt ptfe membrane that measured at the open circuit condition was 12 90 13 01 and 13 23 l m2 h for resistor control and capacitor modes respectively at the initial stage a higher water flux of 14 60 l m2 h around 10 increment was observed under resistor mode while no significant changes were detected in other two modes this phenomenon can be attributed to the higher voltage in resistor mode as the joule heating effect can rise the temperature of water leading to a higher vapor pressure to confirm this explanation an experiment was conducted to measure the flux before and after cnt ptfe membrane was electrified fig s12 with the extension of operation time the flux of both capacitor mode and resistor mode showed a trend of liner decreasing with the decline rate of 0 23 h and 0 32 h respectively while for the control mode the decline rate was up to 0 59 h after 45 h operation although similar trends of flux drop were observed between capacitor mode and resistor mode the fouling patterns were quite different considering the sem eds analysis organic fouling and caco3 scaling were the major fouling composite in capacitor mode while the flux drop in resistor mode was resulted from organic fouling silicate fouling and the decrease of electric current the sem eds analysis together with clsm analysis further revealed that organic fouling silicate fouling and biofouling co occurred in control mode leading to the most severe flux drop after 225 h the normalized fluxes of the three modes stabilize with the decline rate of less than 0 12 h at the end of the process the normalized flux of control mode decreased to 18 5 but its value still remained higher than 40 4 in capacitor mode and 35 5 in resistor mode respectively representing that these two anti fouling modes can enhance the membrane performance effectively in regard of the nmds analysis of microbial community section 3 2 2 it can be seen that both capacitor and resistor modes showed an especial property of bacteria killing which will be detailed discussed in the following section 3 4 the mechanism of the two anti biofouling modes as stated above both capacitor mode and resistor mode can mitigate biofouling effectively although their anti biofouling behavior was quite different recently the anti biofouling mechanism of electrically conductive membrane was investigated by researchers asadi and torkaman 2014 jiménez sánchez et al 2017 vecitis et al 2011 and can be explained by direct oxidation indirect oxidation coulomb repulsion and joule heating direct oxidation means the charged surface can damage the cell membrane structure directly while indirect oxidation refers to the generation of free chlorine and reactive oxygen species which can lead to a degradation of cell membrane coulomb repulsion can drag the charged particles or bacteria and thus prevent the adhesion of bacteria on membrane surface joule heating may be considered as a thermal treatment and bacterial cell inactivation with joule heating would occur when the temperature was over 50 c in the capacitor mode electric field was developed between cnt ptfe membrane and graphite plate while for the resistor mode the electric field was mostly formed in the cnt layer due to the different distribution of electric field and applied voltage enormous electrons transfer from bacteria to charged surface only occurred in capacitor mode while obvious joule heating effect happened in resistor mode fig 5 in the capacitor mode as most bacteria carried a net negative surface charge they will tend to adhere to the positively charged graphite plate instead of cnt ptfe membrane causing a lowest level of biomass on the cnt ptfe membrane among three modes the positively charged surfaces also exert an anti microbial effect on adhered gram negative bacteria gottenbos et al 2001 which was verified by the lefse analysis section 3 2 3 and microbial community structure analysis section 3 2 1 additionally the electric field will cause the electrons transfer from bacteria to the positively charged surface inducing the burst of ros distorting the bacteria shape especially the gram negative bacteria which has a thinner cell membrane busscher et al 2006 shockman and barren 1983 and leading to the death finally ros are regarded as highly reactive cytotoxic molecules formed by the incomplete one electron reduction of o and some environmental stressors may also cause endogenous ros generation leading to the oxidation of biomolecules cabiscol català et al 2000 lemire et al 2013 excess ros generation might be occurred in response to external electric field or abrupt changes in temperature imlay 2013 pandit et al 2017 ros on the membrane surface was detected quantitatively fig 5 fig s13 using fluorescence microscope and results showed that capacitor mode has the highest ros activity with the ratio of fluorescent area up to 18 85 while few ros was observed in control mode and resistor mode as the ratio of fluorescent area was 0 50 and 0 37 respectively it was reasonable that large amount of ros was generated in the capacitor mode due to the existence of external electric field comparatively the production of ros was much lower at the end of the operation for control mode and resistor mode as abrupt changes in temperature occurred only in the initial stage of md process and the bacteria can gradually adapt to this condition compared with capacitor group the applied voltage in resistor group was much higher but almost no electric field was formed between the graphite electrode and cnt ptfe membrane the production of joule heating would elevate the temperature of cnt layer providing more environment stress to the bacteria and thus mitigating the biofouling the surface of membrane has the relatively lower temperature than bulk solution due to temperature polarization shakaib et al 2012 zodrow et al 2014 while the joule heating significantly increases the temperature of membrane surface to evaluate the joule heating process a temperature measuring approach was developed using temperature sensitive materials fig 5 and s14 for the yellow temperature sensitive layer the colour started to change at 44 c then completely faded when the temperature was higher than 50 c in comparison the colour changing point for red layer was about 63 c as shown in the video and fig s14 both layers showed their original colour at the open circuit condition while the yellow layer faded when charged with the voltage of 30 v this phenomenon indicated that the temperature of membrane surface was lower than the bulk phase in the control mode while joule heating could significantly increase the membrane temperature from lower than 44 c to over 50 c in resistor mode considering the higher abundance of thermophilic bacteria in the total microbial community section 3 2 1 it was reasonable that the resistor mode can inhibit the growth of some bacteria by elevating membrane temperature the rise of membrane temperature was an important factor of the anti biofouling phenomenon but maybe not the only reason the direct degradation of bacteria might also be contributed to the anti biofouling effect vecitis et al 2011 constructed a filtration system which was similar to our resistor mode md system with e coli as the model biofouling bacteria the results showed that this system can inactivate bacteria efficiently and the direct oxidation of bacteria was the main anti biofouling function however different from this research the feed solution in our study was natural water and the operation time was much longer which means the microbial community was quite complex thus the phenomenon of direct oxidation was hard to characterize in further researches we will pay more attention to the mechanism research of resistor mode with an especial focus on direct oxidation 4 conclusion in this study an electrically conductive membrane was developed and two novel anti biofouling modes were constructed using such membranes the performances of two modes were systematically analyzed and the results led to the following conclusions 1 both capacitor mode and resistor mode had obvious inhabitation on bacteria especially the capacitor mode exhibited stronger prevention capability on biomass accumulation than resistor mode 2 microbial community succession occurred during the process and the community structures were quite different at the end of the operation 3 the competitive electrostatic adsorption of bacteria cells on positive electrode associated by the cell disruption effect of electro catalyzed ros generation contributed to the anti biofouling function in capacitor mode and the inactivation of bacteria in resistor mode was a result of temperature increment on membrane surface caused by joule heating effects acknowledge this study was mainly financially supported by national natural science foundation of china grant number 51508153 fundamental research

are considered to be drug resistant bacteria in agsbr furthermore the dynamics of microbial community changed significantly at three levels including the enrichment of drug resistant microorganisms

growth cao et al 2018 kuruti et al 2017 however a large amount of sw can promote severe water pollution because of the emission of high chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and antibiotics cheng et al 2018a antibiotics have been widely used to prevent and cure diseases promote animal growth and improve food utilization efficiency cao et al 2018 however many of these antibiotics cannot be completely metabolized in the animal body or eliminated from wastewater and thus can have a direct impact on the environment hu et al 2010 the antibiotics as emerging contaminants in wastewater have received considerable concerns zhu et al 2017 pruden et al 2013 yan et al 2018 oxytetracycline otc is one of the most important broad spectrum antibiotic which has been overused and entered environmental matrices owing to its low cost and high antibacterial activity yan et al 2018 liu et al 2016 otc has the same properties as most antibiotics due to low absorption rate approximately 70 90 of parent and metabolites released to the receiving aquatic water environments massé et al 2014 therefore it is important to remove otc from wastewater currently the removal methods of antibiotics mainly include biological treatment nanotechnology degradation wu et al 2018a electrochemical oxidation tang et al 2018 photocatalytic oxidation li et al 2018a and membrane technology cheng et al 2018b 2018c the membrane technology merely enriches otc from the wastewater to the reactor munir et al 2011 and the otc is not completely degraded it may return to the environment and cause potential damage although other methods can effectively remove otc the removal of cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and tp in sw are limited biological treatment processes play an important role in the removal of otc biosorption and biodegradation are the process whereby microorganisms decompose organic pollutants which represent the most important mechanism for removing antibiotics from sw cheng et al 2018a the cod nh 4 n and tp in sw can be effectively removed by biological treatment processes in this study granular sludge biological technology was selected to treat wastewater containing otc the removal of otc present in wastewater and the effect of otc on cod nh 4 n and tp removal performance were assessed as a great potential biological treatment method the aerobic granular sludge ags technology has a number of advantages with high biomass an excellent dense microbial structure for withstanding high strength organic wastewater and shock loading strong impact resistance load zhao et al 2015 wang et al 2018 ags usually has large particle size which limits the diffusion depth of oxygen molecules and promotes the formation of stable anoxic anaerobic zones in granular sludge the structure provides an ideal place for removal of nitrogen and phosphorus wu et al 2018b liu and tay 2004 the ags is spherical sludge aggregates composed by diverse microbial communities zhao et al 2015 the uneven surface structure of ags makes it form a large specific surface area krysiak baltyn et al 2019 which is beneficial to the adsorption of organic matters the pores and cavities in the ags surface as substrate transmission channels are beneficial to the adsorption and degradation of organic matters wang et al 2019 lu and chen 2013 based on these advantages ags was widely used to treat various wastewater the ags with elevated biomass retention and greater biomass concentration could be effective for the removal of antibiotics from wastewater kang et al 2017 sequencing batch reactor sbr is simple process that has good removal of pollutants and it also has strong adaptability to the change of water quality and quantity so it is widely used in the treatment of sw containing antibiotics béline et al 2007 in the present study aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor agsbr as one of typical biological treatment system was investigated for removal of otc in sw the dynamics of microbial community in agsbr during long term otc pressure was studied by using high throughput sequencing the main objectives of this study were to investigate the removal of pollutants cod nh 4 n tp in wastewater by agsbr process under long term otc stress and to study the mechanism of otc removal by ags focusing on the degradation products of otc and functional genes 2 material and methods 2 1 reactors and operating conditions for treating otc wastewater the reaction apparatuses were set up as two parallel sbrs the blank sbr r1 and the

sbr controlled by the programmable logic controller plc the aeration rate was 0 3 m3 h that displayed using a gas flow meter 2 2 inoculated sludge experimental sludge was mature granule sludge which acclimated and obtained after 60 days in the sbr by the activated sludge from the wenchang urban sewage treatment plant heilongjiang china the particle size of experimental sludge was approximately 2 3 mm with compact structure and smooth surface the mixed liquor suspended solid mlss was 10 06 g l and the sludge volume index svi was 54 67 ml g 2 3 wastewater composition the wastewater containing otc was treated by granular sludge and the synthetic wastewater was prepared for simulating sw which contained otc it was prepared in water by dissolving glucose and anhydrous sodium acetate as sources of carbon the concentrations of glucose and sodium acetate were 2104 mg l and 1403 mg l respectively besides it contained g l k2hpo4 3h2o 0 078 kh2po4 0 078 nh4cl 0 551 cacl2 0 075 fecl3 6h2o 0 008 and mgso4 7h2o 0 023 0 1 ml of trace element mix was added to 1 l of simulating sw for supply of trace elements and the main components of trace elements included iron copper zinc magnesium nicotinamide calcium pantothenate calcium hydrogen phosphate l lysine salt choline bistartrate inositol iodine manganese and potassium the concentrations of cod nh4 n tp and otc in simulated experimental wastewater were approximately 3000 200 mg l 150 20 mg l 26 2 mg l and 300 10 μg l respectively 2 4 chemical analysis the otc was analyzed using agilent 1260 series hplc with ultraviolet detection at 227 nm the column used was an agilent eclipse xdb c18 chromatography column 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm by mobile phase composed of 0 1 formic acid solution and acetonitrile with a volume ratio of

degradation products are listed in table 1 the samples of otc and its products were analyzed by direct injection after filtration with 0 22 μm filtration membrane the wastewater parameters of cod nh4 n tp mlss and svi were analyzed according to the standard methods apha 1998 total organic carbon toc was determined by toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan and the sample was acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid to remove inorganic carbon before detection of toc all the experiment data of chemical analysis were the average values of the three same determinations the error bars denoted the standard deviation of the values with the three same determinations 2 5 adsorption and degradation experiments of otc the photodegration and adsorption of containers on otc could be neglected in the absence of granules shi et al 2011 the agss before and after adaptation to otc were sterilized and used for adsorption experiment and the inactivation of granules was carried out with the addition of sodium azide nan3 at 0 3 weight to volume w v kerr et al 2000 shi et al 2011 before experiment the ags sample was rinsed three times with deionized water the adsorption kinetic experiments of the ags on otc were conducted in 100 ml glass beakers with otc solution at various concentrations 1 2 5 10 and 15 mg l the wet ags mass of 10 g was used at the beginning of the tests samples were collected at predetermined time intervals the concentrations of residual otc were determined immediately after it was filtered with a 0 22 μm filter membrane the total removal kinetic experiments were done in the similar way used for the adsorption kinetics experiments in the presence of sludge activities the amount of degradation in the degradation kinetics experiment was the total removal amount of the ags on otc deducted that of the adsorption amount the adsorption amount of the ags on otc was calculated by performing a mass balance using the following equation 1 q t c o c t m l s s where qt is the amount of adsorbed otc at time t mg g c0 mg l is the initial otc concentration and ct mg l is the residual otc concentration at t time shi et al 2011 the biodegradation amount of the ags on otc was calculated using the following formula 2 cd c0 ce qt mlss where cd is the amount of degradation otc mg g ce mg l is the final concentration of the otc after the total removal experiment 2 6 dna extraction sludge samples 10 ml were collected from the r1 and r2 reactors operating at 1 r1 1 and r2 1 15 r1 2 and r2 2 30 r1 3 and r2 3 45 r1 4 and r2 4 60 r1 5 and r2 5 and 75 days r1 6 and r2 6 respectively the dna extraction was performed using omega e z n a mag bind soil dna kit cetin et al 2018 the concentration and quality of the extracted dna were determined using electrophoresis on a 1 weight volume agarose gel then extracted dna was stored at 20 c until analysis 2 7 pcr amplification and high throughput sequencing the dna was amplified with a set of primers targeting of the bacteria 16s rdna and two rounds of amplification were performed the first round of amplification was quantitated by qubit 2 0 dna assay kit to determine the amount of dna that should be added for the

were introduced for the second round of pcr the raw sequence data were cleaned reduced and analysed using mothur version 1 36 1 cetin et al 2018 chimeras were eliminated using the implanted code uchime edgar et al 2011 and taxonomy files were adopted from the greengenes database cetin et al 2018 kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg select international standard database carbohydrate active enzymes database cazy is a professional database related to carbohydrate enzymes that includes the family of enzymes that catalyze carbohydrate degradation modification and biosynthesis it consists of five main categories glycoside hydrolases ghs glycosyl transferases gts polysaccharide lyases pls carbohydrate esterases ces auxiliary activities aas and carbohydrate binding modules cbms hmmer3 was used to compare the sequence of gene globulin with cazy database and the corresponding annotation information of carbohydrate enzymes was obtained including type of enzymes and the abundance of enzymes was expressed by the number of annotated genes 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of otc on agsbr performance the removal of cod through the agsbr technology during different operation phases were studied and the results are shown in fig 1 a it showed that the removal rate of cod in the r1 reactor was slightly higher than that of in the r2 reactor in the beginning of operation the removal rates were about 97 and 95 respectively the removal rates for cod in both reactors presented a steady trend after operation time of 10 days and they were more than 98 during the late stage the average effluent concentrations of cod in the r1 and r2 reactors throughout the whole operation were 46 48 mg l and 52 26 mg l respectively the pores and cavities existed in the granular sludge surface are believed to be substrate transmission channels which are beneficial to the adsorption and degradation of organic matters wang et al 2019 lu and chen 2013 a wide variety of bacteria protozoa and metazoa in ags which can help degrade the cod through metabolic activities kang and yuan 2019 the removal effects of the ags on nh4 n in the r1 and r2 reactors are shown in fig 1b in the beginning of operation the removal rates of nh4 n in the r1 and r2 reactors decreased from 91 79 to 89 18 83 00 and 81 38 respectively then the removal rates of nh4 n increased with increase of operation time after operation time of 43 days the removal rates in both reactors presented a steady trend and they were maintained at around 90 during the late stage the denitrification process by ags is the result of synergistic action between different microorganisms the ags provide an ideal place for facultative and aerobic microbial symbiosis these microorganisms include all kinds of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and the denitrifying bacteria wang et al 2007 2019 these characteristics make a good foundation for nitrogen removal as showed in fig 1c the removal rate of tp has a fluctuation in the early operation and it was stable until 29 days with the increase of operation time the removal rates of tp in the r1 and r2 reactors increased from 90 to 91 2 94 and 98 5 at operation time of 29 days respectively at the later stage of operation the removal rates of tp in the r1 and r2 reactors were stable around 94 1 and 97 9 respectively the experiment results showed that granular sludge had a good removal effect on tp in otc containing wastewater the removal of tp by ags is due to polyphosphate accumulating microorganisms paos which are distributed in the surface layer and inner layer of granular sludge kreuk et al 2005 wang et al 2009 2019 and the special structure of ags that surface aerobic and inner anaerobic also ensure the effective removal of phosphorus 3 2 removal of otc the removal effect of the ags in the r2 reactor on otc is shown in fig 1d it can be seen that the removal rate of otc has a fluctuation in the early operation the removal rate of otc first increased from 73 00 to 80 73 at 19 days and then gradually decreased to 66 84 at 30 days the reason may be that otc is bulky organic molecule and the molecular sieving effect leads to a lower sorption rate in granular sludge ji et al 2009 the microbes gradually adapted to the otc in the system with time and the removal of otc was improved subsequently the removal rate increased with increase of operation time and the removal of otc by the agsbr technology tended to be stable with the removal rate maintaining at 89 and the effluent concentration of otc was about 33 μg l the ags has larger specific surface area krysiak baltyn et al 2019 which is conducive to the adsorption of the otc in sw the ags has the advantages of elevated biomass retention and greater biomass concentration zhao et al 2015 which contribute to the degradation of the otc by comparison with some existing methods zaidi et al 2019 migliore et al 2012 ding et al 2018 the proposed ags method has advantage of high removal rates for otc and conventional pollutants of cod nh 4 n and tp 3 3 adsorption and biodegradation of granular sludge on otc fig 2 a and b showed the adsorption of the ags on otc in the concentration range of 1 15 mg l respectively before and after adaptation to otc it can be clearly seen from fig 2a and b that the adsorption amount of the ags on otc increased with the increasing otc concentration and the adsorption capacity of ags on otc in fig 2a was greater than that of in fig 2b when the adsorption time was exceeded than 60 h the adsorption of otc in different initial concentrations reached the adsorption equilibrium the adsorption amounts of otc with different concentrations in fig 2a were 0 07 0 14 0 31 0 52 0 89 mg g respectively while the adsorption amounts in fig 2b were 0 05 0 06 0 17 0 38 0 71 mg g respectively the proportion of adsorption in total removal amount of otc before adaptation to otc in fig 2e at some concentration was greater than that of after adaptation in fig 2f and the values first increased and then decreased with the increasing otc concentration which were 60 67 72 57 53 respectively however the maximum proportion of adsorption in total removal amount of otc in fig 2f was 46 it indicated that the removal of otc by ags in early stage of operation depended on the adsorption the adsorption mechanism of activated sludge on otc was reported in a specific ph song et al 2014 the predominant form of the otc molecule should be the zwitterion species which could combine with sludge through cationic exchange and electrostatic attraction mechanisms it is presumed that ags domesticated by activated sludge can be able to provide more adsorption sites for zwitterion species xu and li 2010 fig 2c and d showed the biodegradation of the ags on otc in the concentration range of 1 15 mg l respectively before and after domestication by otc the degradation amount of the ags on otc also increased with the increasing otc concentration and the amount of degradation in fig 2c at some concentration was lower than that of in fig 2d in the entire reaction when the reaction time exceeded than 60 h the amounts of otc degradation in different initial concentrations tended to be stable the maximum amounts of degradation with different concentrations in fig 2c were 0 05 0 07 0 12 0 39 0 79 mg g respectively and they were 0 06 0 07 0 32 0 66 0 97 mg g respectively in fig 2d it can be seen that the ags domesticated by otc has obvious effect on the degradation of otc and the proportion of degradation in total removal amount for otc at some concentration increased obviously they were 54 56 72 63 58 respectively the results proved that ags removed otc by rapid adsorption and slow biodegradation it mainly depended on adsorption in the early stage while its biodegradation played a dominant role in the later stage xu and li 2010 beilin and ke 2013 ji et al 2009 which is due to the ags was capable to adapt the otc drugs and contributed to granular sludge for the removal of otc yang et al 2013 mihciokur et al 2016 3 4 biodegradation products and degradation pathways of otc the possible degradation products of otc were analysed by uplc ms ms the otc precursor ion of m z 461 was biodegraded and the total organic carbon toc removal rate reached 70 94 at finally fig s1 which was similar to that in other reports shao et al 2018 huang et al 2015 and the degradation product ions of m z 446 428 447 433 and 382 were detected fig s2 an m z of 446 tr 0 59 min is the loss of 15 from the otc structure this compound might be identified as desamination pathway 1 in fig 3 involved a loss of nh n 23 by otc the m z of 428 tr 0 83 min is less 18 atomic mass than m z 446 which shows that the structure of the substance of m z 446 can dehydrate previous study has shown the carbon ring which farthest from the stable benzene ring in otc molecular structure has many functional groups including amino keto hydroxyl double bond these functional groups are likely to react electron transfer and structural rearrangement under the action of microbial enzymes ding et al 2018 halling sørensen et al 2003 therefore the hydroxyl oh 25 is easily dehydrated with ortho hydrogen h 9 migliore et al 2012 shao et al 2018 the daughter ion of m z 447 is the otc loses 14 atomic masses which presumed that the demethylation of otc the c 21 and c 22 are methyl that linked to n 24 in otc molecules respectively and have weaker atomic bond order which easily to be replaced by h in demethylation reaction loke et al 2003 the substance m z 447 was further degraded to produce m z 433 as showed in pathway 2 in fig 3 it is presumed that compound of m z 382 is the degradation product of the carbon ring that farthest from the stable benzene ring in otc the compound of m z 382 is likely to be formed by degradation of one amino n 23 two hydroxyl groups oh 27 28 and dehydration oh 25 and h 14 on compound of m z 447 as showed in pathway 3 in fig 3 3 5 the enrichment and succession of microbial community in the r1 and r2 reactors the microbial communities of ags in the r1 and r2 reactors were analyzed by high throughput to evaluate the effects of otc on microorganisms and the identified bacterial structure and relative abundance are shown in fig 4 a c at the phylum class and genus levels respectively it can be seen from fig 4a that proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were dominant phyla in the ags samples from r1 1 and r2 1 however their relative abundances both decreased in the r1 and r2 reactors with the increase of operation time but the number of proteobacteria decreased in the r2 reactor was smaller than that of in the r1 reactor indicating that it has resistance to otc on the contrary the relative abundances of actinobacteria both increased in two reactors with the operation time which increased from 0 94 to 21 08 in the r1 and 0 33 29 92 in the r2 respectively compared to other microbes firmicutes decreased from 10 04 to 1 8 in the r1 reactor while it enriched from 1 38 to 7 19 in the r2 reactor that indicated the firmicutes was capable to adapt the otc drugs and contributed to granular sludge for resisting otc some studies on the microbial communities have shown that firmicutes played a vital role in the processing of complex substances yan et al 2018 kiely et al 2011 the relative abundance of verrucomicrobia increased significantly in the r1 reactor which increased from 5 18 to 32 46 while it decreased from 14 99 to 3 93 in the r2 reactor indicating that otc had a significant inhibitory effect on verrucomicrobia the results showed that most microbes in ags were resistant to otc such as proteobacteria actinobacteria and firmicutes which would be resistant to otc however otc had a great effect on some microbes such as the relative abundance of verrucomicrobia decreased from r2 1 to r2 6 and the planctomycetes eventually disappeared after the addition of otc fig 4b showed the dynamic variation of microbial communities in the different operating times at class classification level the microbial community structures in addition of otc were quite different moreover some microbes showed an increasing or decreasing tendency with addition of otc it can be seen from fig 4b the relative abundances of actinobacteria cytophagia and spartobacteria increased with the increase of operation time in two reactors simultaneously and the relative abundances of γ proteobacteria sphingobacteriia δ proteobacteria and bacteroidia decreased with the operation time in the r1 and r2 reactors simultaneously the results showed that these microorganisms were mainly affected by the operation conditions meanwhile the β proteobacteria decreased in the r1 reactor and it was stable in the r2 reactor furthermore the clostridia and α proteobacteria decreased in the r1 reactor and increased in the r2 reactor these three kinds of microbes had advantages over other bacteria in the ags system and they would be resistant to otc previous results showed that the proportion of relative abundances of these microorganisms were larger under the higher antibiotic concentration which showed that they were indeed resistant rodriguez sanchez et al 2017 vyrides et al 2018 with the addition of otc drugs the relative abundance of flavobacteriia changed from 7 56 to 7 16 the trend in the r1 reactor was relatively stable however it gradually decreased from 15 21 to 5 04 in the r2 reactor and the relative abundance of verrucomicrobiae increased in the r1 reactor and decreased in the r2 that indicated the otc had a great effect on some microbes it can be seen that the increase or decrease trend of microbes were more obvious at class level such as the trend of α proteobacteria clostridia and β proteobacteria stable or increase after addition to otc which has useful to removal of otc but the flavobacteriia and verrucomicrobiaeare were greatly influenced by otc the result showed that the bacterial community of granules was dynamic but a pronounced shift in its structure occurred during otc feeding further analysis based on the top 29 genera in samples from the r1 and r2 reactors is presented in fig 4c the relative abundances of zoogloea decreased simultaneously in two reactors microbes with similar trends also included chryseobacterium pseudomonas and bdellovibrio and so on on the contrary luteolibacter and actinotignum were the representatives that increased at the same in two reactors and finally became the dominant microbes in the r1 and r2 reactors with the operation time some strains such as comamonas lactococcus and fluviicola exhibited the enrichment phenomenon in addition of otc in the r2 reactor which became the main functional bacteria for resisting otc the literature has reported the comamonas has strong degradation ability to naphthalene phenol salicylic acid and phthalic acid liu et al 2008 and the molecular structure of otc is similar to those of above compounds so it is speculated that the mechanism of the comamonas degraded otc is similar to those of above substances liu et al 2017 lactococcus played a vital role on keeping the stable of system operation wang et al 2018 fluviicola has also been reported to be resistant to multiple antibiotics and able to capture new antibiotic resistance genes han et al 2018 woyke et al 2011 li et al 2018b it is reported that these microbes can grow well under the pressure of antibiotics carlson et al 2015 caniça et al 2015 in summary the change of microbes in ags under long term otc selection pressure was a dynamic process which included the enrichment of drug resistant microbes and the microbes that gradually reduced or even disappeared under the pressure of otc the changing microbial populations during degradation of otc may result from cooperative or synergistic effects where the presence of one microbial population promotes growth of other specific types the interaction between different bacterial populations may play an important role in the degradation of organic matter and on the stability of the system 3 6 differences between enzymes and microorganisms in two reactors some studies have shown that the degradation of organic matter is mainly via co metabolism of microorganisms hedegaard et al 2018 li et al 2018c which includes a series of continuous enzymatic reactions so the role of enzymes cannot be ignored ely et al 1995 lucia et al 2018 the differences of enzymes in the r1 and r2 reactors are shown in fig 5 a the abscissa represents the type of enzyme and the ordinate represents the number of genes annotating the enzyme it can be seen from fig 5a compared with the r1 reactor the abundances of enzymes decreased in the r2 such as cbms ces and ghs these three kinds of enzymes play an important role in the chemical compound metabolism which are beneficial for maintenance of microbial activity boraston et al 2004 furtado et al 2018 nakamura et al 2017 cantarel et al 2009 lundemo et al 2014 however after the introduction of otc into the reactor the number of these enzymes decrease which indicate the otc inhibited activity of several enzymes the abundances of gts in the r2 reactor is greater than in the r1 and pls and aas abundances in both reactors are almost the same gts are related to the biosynthesis of antibiotics it can be glycosylated at the late stage of antibiotic biosynthesis and the activity of antibiotics was regulated by changing the location type and quantity of carbonyl group withers 2001 pls are a kind of enzymes that crack glycoside bonds at the c 4 site and remove an h atom from the c 5 site to produce an unsaturated product by trans elimination eckersley and berger 2018 aas can catalyze the oxidation reduction reaction of organic compounds and make them oxidized by oxygen and remove hydrogen from molecules kim et al 2015 2016 it is speculated that the gts pls and aas enzymes in the agsbr system may play an important role in the removal of otc in depth analysis of the predominant taxa was carried out by the lefse algorithm and illustrated the main differences between the r1 and r2 reactors fig 5b judging by statistically significant differences segata et al 2011 david et al 2014 seven biomarkers were found at an lda threshold of 3 0 fig 5c as showed in fig 5b the inner to outer circles correspond to kingdom to genus levels and taxa with significant differences in all samples are marked by a corresponding color and show a concrete taxon name and lda score in fig 5c the other layers of taxa might be important but did not show obvious differences in all samples at the class level the distinction between the r1 and r2 reactors was observed and confirmed the conclusion about the effect of the otc on microbial communities the differences are represented by colors of the most abundant biomarkers and each circle s diameter is proportional to the relative abundance of taxa lefse analysis revealed that sphingobacteriia and β proteobacteria are two kinds of microorganisms in both reactors with obvious difference at class level and the obvious difference microbes at order level are sphingobacteriales sphingomonadales burkholderiales and neisseriales at family level chitinophagaceae comamonadaceae neisseriaceae and so on are important microbes in the r2 reactor at genus level comamonas lactococcus fluviicola pedobacter acidovorax and so on in the r2 reactor are different with the r1 reactor the results showed that after the long term operation these microbes that obvious difference in the r1 and r2 reactors played an indispensable role in resisting otc 4 conclusions this study describes a biological technique for otc removal from sw using an ags in sbr the results showed that agsbr can effectively remove cod nh4 n tp and otc pollutants simultaneously which the removal rates were 98 0 90 0 97 9 and 89 0 respectively moreover the proportion of degradation in total removal amount of otc increased obviously in domesticated ags which was increased from 28 to 72 when the concentration of otc is 5 mg l a variety of degradation products were detected by mass spectrometry metagenome sequencing has shown that enzymes may play an indispensable role in microbial metabolism of otc such as gts pls aas in addition the dynamics of microbial community were investigated during long term otc pressure at phylum level proteobacteria actinobacteria and firmicutes were functional bacteria while at class level α proteobacteria clostridia and β proteobacteria were resistant to otc at genus level comamonas lactococcus fluviicola and so on became functional bacteria declaration of interest statement all

18696,in this study oxytetracycline otc as a target pollutant in swine wastewater was removed by aerobic granular sludge ags the removal rate of 300 μg l otc in aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor agsbr increased to 88 00 in 33 days and maintained stable the chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and total phosphorus tp in wastewater were also efficiently removed the removal of otc mainly depended on the adsorption and biodegradation of ags and the biodegradation was increased obviously after ags adaptation to otc the degradation products of otc were analyzed by mass spectrometry the analysis of metagenome sequencing revealed that the enzymes such as glycosyl transferases gts polysaccharide lyases pls and auxiliary activities aas may play an important role in the removal of otc the lefse analysis showed that the flavobacteriia flavobacteriales cryomorphaceae and fluviicola were four kinds of microbes with significant difference in otc feed reactor which

contaminants in wastewater have received considerable concerns zhu et al 2017 pruden et al 2013 yan et al 2018 oxytetracycline otc is one of the most important broad spectrum antibiotic which has been overused and entered environmental matrices owing to its low cost and high antibacterial activity yan et al 2018 liu et al 2016 otc has the same properties as most antibiotics due to low absorption rate approximately 70 90 of parent and metabolites released to the receiving aquatic water environments massé et al 2014 therefore it is important to remove otc from wastewater currently the removal methods of antibiotics mainly include biological treatment nanotechnology degradation wu et al 2018a electrochemical oxidation tang et al 2018 photocatalytic oxidation li et al 2018a and membrane technology cheng et al 2018b 2018c the membrane technology merely enriches otc from the wastewater to the reactor munir et al 2011 and the otc is not completely degraded it may return to the environment and cause potential damage although other methods can effectively remove otc the removal of cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n and tp in sw are limited biological treatment processes play an important role in the removal of otc biosorption and biodegradation are the process whereby microorganisms decompose organic pollutants which represent the most important mechanism for removing antibiotics from sw cheng et al 2018a the cod nh 4 n and tp in sw can be effectively removed by biological treatment processes in this study granular sludge biological technology was selected to treat wastewater containing otc the removal of otc present in wastewater and the effect of otc on cod nh 4 n and tp removal performance were assessed as a great potential biological treatment method the aerobic granular sludge ags technology has a number of advantages with high biomass an excellent dense microbial structure for withstanding high strength organic wastewater and shock loading strong impact resistance load zhao et al 2015 wang et al 2018 ags usually has large particle size which limits the diffusion depth of oxygen molecules and promotes the formation of stable anoxic anaerobic zones in granular sludge the structure provides an ideal place for removal of nitrogen and phosphorus wu et al 2018b liu and tay 2004 the ags is spherical sludge aggregates composed by diverse microbial communities zhao et al 2015 the uneven surface structure of ags makes it form a large specific surface area krysiak baltyn et al 2019 which is beneficial to the adsorption of organic matters the pores and cavities in the ags surface as substrate transmission channels are beneficial to the adsorption and degradation of organic matters wang et al 2019 lu and chen 2013 based on these advantages ags was widely used to treat various wastewater the ags with elevated biomass retention and greater biomass concentration could be effective for the removal of antibiotics from wastewater kang et al 2017 sequencing batch reactor sbr is simple process that has good removal of pollutants and it also has strong adaptability to the change of water quality and quantity so it is widely used in the treatment of sw containing antibiotics béline et al 2007 in the present study aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor agsbr as one of typical biological treatment system was investigated for removal of otc in sw the dynamics of microbial community in agsbr during long term otc pressure was studied by using high throughput sequencing the main objectives of this study were to investigate the removal of pollutants cod nh 4 n tp in wastewater by agsbr process under long term otc stress and to study the mechanism of otc removal by ags focusing on the degradation products of otc and functional genes 2 material and methods 2 1 reactors and operating conditions for treating otc wastewater the reaction apparatuses were set up as two parallel sbrs the blank sbr r1 and the target sbr r2 which were reactors in the absence and presence of otc respectively the height diameter ratio h d of the sbr reactor was 15 its working volume was 625 ml and the volume exchange rate ver was 50 the reactor operated 6 cycles daily and each cycle of the reactor took 4 h which included 6 min of substrate filling 228 min of aeration 2 min of settling and 4 min of effluent discharge the sbr controlled by the programmable logic controller plc the aeration rate was 0 3 m3 h that displayed using a gas flow meter 2 2 inoculated sludge experimental sludge was mature granule sludge which acclimated and obtained after 60 days in the sbr by the activated sludge from the wenchang urban sewage treatment plant heilongjiang china the particle size of experimental sludge was approximately 2 3 mm with compact structure and smooth surface the mixed liquor suspended solid mlss was 10 06 g l and the sludge volume index svi was 54 67 ml g 2 3 wastewater composition the wastewater containing otc was treated by granular sludge and the synthetic wastewater was prepared for simulating sw which contained otc it was prepared in water by dissolving glucose and anhydrous sodium acetate as sources of carbon the concentrations of glucose and sodium acetate were 2104 mg l and 1403 mg l respectively besides it contained g l k2hpo4 3h2o 0 078 kh2po4 0 078 nh4cl 0 551 cacl2 0 075 fecl3 6h2o 0 008 and mgso4 7h2o 0 023 0 1 ml of trace element mix was added to 1 l of simulating sw for supply of trace elements and the main components of trace elements included iron copper zinc magnesium nicotinamide calcium pantothenate calcium hydrogen phosphate l lysine salt choline bistartrate inositol iodine manganese and potassium the concentrations of cod nh4 n tp and otc in simulated experimental wastewater were approximately 3000 200 mg l 150 20 mg l 26 2 mg l and 300 10 μg l respectively 2 4 chemical analysis the otc was analyzed using agilent 1260 series hplc with ultraviolet detection at 227 nm the column used was an agilent eclipse xdb c18 chromatography column 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm by mobile phase composed of 0 1 formic acid solution and acetonitrile with a volume ratio of 80 20 at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min the degradation products of otc were analyzed using ultra high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer uplc ms ms waters usa the column used was the acquity uplc beh c18 chromatography column 50 mm 2 1 mm 1 7 μm waters usa the moving phase was 0 1 formic acid and acetonitrile the flow rate was 0 2 ml min and the moving phase ratios of each degradation products are listed in table 1 the samples of otc and its products were analyzed by direct injection after filtration with 0 22 μm filtration membrane the wastewater parameters of cod nh4 n tp mlss and svi were analyzed according to the standard methods apha 1998 total organic carbon toc was determined by toc analyzer toc vcph shimadzu japan and the sample was acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid to remove inorganic carbon before detection of toc all the experiment data of chemical analysis were the average values of the three same determinations the error bars denoted the standard deviation of the values with the three same determinations 2 5 adsorption and degradation experiments of otc the photodegration and adsorption of containers on otc could be neglected in the absence of granules shi et al 2011 the agss before and after adaptation to otc were sterilized and used for adsorption experiment and the inactivation of granules was carried out with the addition of sodium azide nan3 at 0 3 weight to volume w v kerr et al 2000 shi et al 2011 before experiment the ags sample was rinsed three times with deionized water the adsorption kinetic experiments of the ags on otc were conducted in 100 ml glass beakers with otc solution at various concentrations 1 2 5 10 and 15 mg l the wet ags mass of 10 g was used at the beginning of the tests samples were collected at predetermined time intervals the concentrations of residual otc were determined immediately after it was filtered with a 0 22 μm filter membrane the total removal kinetic experiments were done in the similar way used for the adsorption kinetics experiments in the presence of sludge activities the amount of degradation in the degradation kinetics experiment was the total removal amount of the ags on otc deducted that of the adsorption amount the adsorption amount of the ags on otc was calculated by performing a mass balance using the following equation 1 q t c o c t m l s s where qt is the amount of adsorbed otc at time t mg g c0 mg l is the initial otc concentration and ct mg l is the residual otc concentration at t time shi et al 2011 the biodegradation amount of the ags on otc was calculated using the following formula 2 cd c0 ce qt mlss where cd is the amount of degradation otc mg g ce mg l is the final concentration of the otc after the total removal experiment 2 6 dna extraction sludge samples 10 ml were collected from the r1 and r2 reactors operating at 1 r1 1 and r2 1 15 r1 2 and r2 2 30 r1 3 and r2 3 45 r1 4 and r2 4 60 r1 5 and r2 5 and 75 days r1 6 and r2 6 respectively the dna extraction was performed using omega e z n a mag bind soil dna kit cetin et al 2018 the concentration and quality of the extracted dna were determined using electrophoresis on a 1 weight volume agarose gel then extracted dna was stored at 20 c until analysis 2 7 pcr amplification and high throughput sequencing the dna was amplified with a set of primers targeting of the bacteria 16s rdna and two rounds of amplification were performed the first round of amplification was quantitated by qubit 2 0 dna assay kit to determine the amount of dna that should be added for the pcr reaction universal primers 341f primers ccctacacgacgctcttccgatctg barcode cctacgggnggcwgcag 805r primers gactggagttccttggcacccgagaattccagactachvgta tctaatcc illumina bridge pcr compatible primers were introduced for the second round of pcr the raw sequence data were cleaned reduced and analysed using mothur version 1 36 1 cetin et al 2018 chimeras were eliminated using the implanted code uchime edgar et al 2011 and taxonomy files were adopted from the greengenes database cetin et al 2018 kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg select international standard database carbohydrate active enzymes database cazy is a professional database related to carbohydrate enzymes that includes the family of enzymes that catalyze carbohydrate degradation modification and biosynthesis it consists of five main categories glycoside hydrolases ghs glycosyl transferases gts polysaccharide lyases pls carbohydrate esterases ces auxiliary activities aas and carbohydrate binding modules cbms hmmer3 was used to compare the sequence of gene globulin with cazy database and the corresponding annotation information of carbohydrate enzymes was obtained including type of enzymes and the abundance of enzymes was expressed by the number of annotated genes 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of otc on agsbr performance the removal of cod through the agsbr technology during different operation phases were studied and the results are shown in fig 1 a it showed that the removal rate of cod in the r1 reactor was slightly higher than that of in the r2 reactor in the beginning of operation the removal rates were about 97 and 95 respectively the removal rates for cod in both reactors presented a steady trend after operation time of 10 days and they were more than 98 during the late stage the average effluent concentrations of cod in the r1 and r2 reactors throughout the whole operation were 46 48 mg l and 52 26 mg l respectively the pores and cavities existed in the granular sludge surface are believed to be substrate transmission channels which are beneficial to the adsorption and degradation of organic matters wang et al 2019 lu and chen 2013 a wide variety of bacteria protozoa and metazoa in ags which can help degrade the cod through metabolic activities kang and yuan 2019 the removal effects of the ags on nh4 n in the r1 and r2 reactors are shown in fig 1b in the beginning of operation the removal rates of nh4 n in the r1 and r2 reactors decreased from 91 79 to 89 18 83 00 and 81 38 respectively then the removal rates of nh4 n increased with increase of operation time after operation time of 43 days the removal rates in both reactors presented a steady trend and they were maintained at around 90 during the late stage the denitrification process by ags is the result of synergistic action between different microorganisms the ags provide an ideal place for facultative and aerobic microbial symbiosis these microorganisms include all kinds of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and the denitrifying bacteria wang et al 2007 2019 these characteristics make a good foundation for nitrogen removal as showed in fig 1c the removal rate of tp has a fluctuation in the early operation and it was stable until 29 days with the increase of operation time the removal rates of tp in the r1 and r2 reactors increased from 90 to 91 2 94 and 98 5 at operation time of 29 days respectively at the later stage of operation the removal rates of tp in the r1 and r2 reactors were stable around 94 1 and 97 9 respectively the experiment results showed that granular sludge had a good removal effect on tp in otc containing wastewater the removal of tp by ags is due to polyphosphate accumulating microorganisms paos which are distributed in the surface layer and inner layer of granular sludge kreuk et al 2005 wang et al 2009 2019 and the special structure of ags that surface aerobic and inner anaerobic also ensure the effective removal of phosphorus 3 2 removal of otc the removal effect of the ags in the r2 reactor on otc is shown in fig 1d it can be seen that the removal rate of otc has a fluctuation in the early operation the removal rate of otc first increased from 73 00 to 80 73 at 19 days and then gradually decreased to 66 84 at 30 days the reason may be that otc is bulky organic molecule and the molecular sieving effect leads to a lower sorption rate in granular sludge ji et al 2009 the microbes gradually adapted to the otc in the system with time and the removal of otc was improved subsequently the removal rate increased with increase of operation time and the removal of otc by the agsbr technology tended to be stable with the removal rate maintaining at 89 and the effluent concentration of otc was about 33 μg l the ags has larger specific surface area krysiak baltyn et al 2019 which is conducive to the adsorption of the otc in sw the ags has the advantages of elevated biomass retention and greater biomass concentration zhao et al 2015 which contribute to the degradation of the otc by comparison with some existing methods zaidi et al 2019 migliore et al 2012 ding et al 2018 the proposed ags method has advantage of high removal rates for otc and conventional pollutants of cod nh 4 n and tp 3 3 adsorption and biodegradation of granular sludge on otc fig 2 a and b showed the adsorption of the ags on otc in the concentration range of 1 15 mg l respectively before and after adaptation to otc it can be clearly seen from fig 2a and b that the adsorption amount of the ags on otc increased with the increasing otc concentration and the adsorption capacity of ags on otc in fig 2a was greater than that of in fig 2b when the adsorption time was exceeded than 60 h the adsorption of otc in different initial concentrations reached the adsorption equilibrium the adsorption amounts of otc with different concentrations in fig 2a were 0 07 0 14 0 31 0 52 0 89 mg g respectively while the adsorption amounts in fig 2b were 0 05 0 06 0 17 0 38 0 71 mg g respectively the proportion of adsorption in total removal amount of otc before adaptation to otc in fig 2e at some concentration was greater than that of after adaptation in fig 2f and the values first increased and then decreased with the increasing otc concentration which were 60 67 72 57 53 respectively however the maximum proportion of adsorption in total removal amount of otc in fig 2f was 46 it indicated that the removal of otc by ags in early stage of operation depended on the adsorption the adsorption mechanism of activated sludge on otc was reported in a specific ph song et al 2014 the predominant form of the otc molecule should be the zwitterion species which could combine with sludge through cationic exchange and electrostatic attraction mechanisms it is presumed that ags domesticated by activated sludge can be able to provide more adsorption sites for zwitterion species xu and li 2010 fig 2c and d showed the biodegradation of the ags on otc in the concentration range of 1 15 mg l respectively before and after domestication by otc the degradation amount of the ags on otc also increased with the increasing otc concentration and the amount of degradation in fig 2c at some concentration was lower than that of in fig 2d in the entire reaction when the reaction time exceeded than 60 h the amounts of otc degradation in different initial concentrations tended to be stable the maximum amounts of degradation with different concentrations in fig 2c were 0 05 0 07 0 12 0 39 0 79 mg g respectively and they were 0 06 0 07 0 32 0 66 0 97 mg g respectively in fig 2d it can be seen that the ags domesticated by otc has obvious effect on the degradation of otc and the proportion of degradation in total removal amount for otc at some concentration increased obviously they were 54 56 72 63 58 respectively the results proved that ags removed otc by rapid adsorption and slow biodegradation it mainly depended on adsorption in the early stage while its biodegradation played a dominant role in the later stage xu and li 2010 beilin and ke 2013 ji et al 2009 which is due to the ags was capable to adapt the otc drugs and contributed to granular sludge for the removal of otc yang et al 2013 mihciokur et al 2016 3 4 biodegradation products and degradation pathways of otc the possible degradation products of otc were analysed by uplc ms ms the otc precursor ion of m z 461 was biodegraded and the total organic carbon toc removal rate reached 70 94 at finally fig s1 which was similar to that in other reports shao et al 2018 huang et al 2015 and the degradation product ions of m z 446 428 447 433 and 382 were detected fig s2 an m z of 446 tr 0 59 min is the loss of 15 from the otc structure this compound might be identified as desamination pathway 1 in fig 3 involved a loss of nh n 23 by otc the m z of 428 tr 0 83 min is less 18 atomic mass than m z 446 which shows that the structure of the substance of m z 446 can dehydrate previous study has shown the carbon ring which farthest from the stable benzene ring in otc molecular structure has many functional groups including amino keto hydroxyl double bond these functional groups are likely to react electron transfer and structural rearrangement under the action of microbial enzymes ding et al 2018 halling sørensen et al 2003 therefore the hydroxyl oh 25 is easily dehydrated with ortho hydrogen h 9 migliore et al 2012 shao et al 2018 the daughter ion of m z 447 is the otc loses 14 atomic masses which presumed that the demethylation of otc the c 21 and c 22 are methyl that linked to n 24 in otc molecules respectively and have weaker atomic bond order which easily to be replaced by h in demethylation reaction loke et al 2003 the substance m z 447 was further degraded to produce m z 433 as showed in pathway 2 in fig 3 it is presumed that compound of m z 382 is the degradation product of the carbon ring that farthest from the stable benzene ring in otc the compound of m z 382 is likely to be formed by degradation of one amino n 23 two hydroxyl groups oh 27 28 and dehydration oh 25 and h 14 on compound of m z 447 as showed in pathway 3 in fig 3 3 5 the enrichment and succession of microbial community in the r1 and r2 reactors the microbial communities of ags in the r1 and r2 reactors were analyzed by high throughput to evaluate the effects of otc on microorganisms and the identified bacterial structure and relative abundance are shown in fig 4 a c at the phylum class and genus levels respectively it can be seen from fig 4a that proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were dominant phyla in the ags samples from r1 1 and r2 1 however their relative abundances both decreased in the r1 and r2 reactors with the increase of operation time but the number of proteobacteria decreased in the r2 reactor was smaller than that of in the r1 reactor indicating that it has resistance to otc on the contrary the relative abundances of actinobacteria both increased in two reactors with the operation time which increased from 0 94 to 21 08 in the r1 and 0 33 29 92 in the r2 respectively compared to other microbes firmicutes decreased from 10 04 to 1 8 in the r1 reactor while it enriched from 1 38 to 7 19 in the r2 reactor that indicated the firmicutes was capable to adapt the otc drugs and contributed to granular sludge for resisting otc some studies on the microbial communities have shown that firmicutes played a vital role in the processing of complex substances yan et al 2018 kiely et al 2011 the relative abundance of verrucomicrobia increased significantly in the r1 reactor which increased from 5 18 to 32 46 while it decreased from 14 99 to 3 93 in the r2 reactor indicating that otc had a significant inhibitory effect on verrucomicrobia the results showed that most microbes in ags were resistant to otc such as proteobacteria actinobacteria and firmicutes which would be resistant to otc however otc had a great effect on some microbes such as the relative abundance of verrucomicrobia decreased from r2 1 to r2 6 and the planctomycetes eventually disappeared after the addition of otc fig 4b showed the dynamic variation of microbial communities in the different operating times at class classification level the microbial community structures in addition of otc were quite different moreover some microbes showed an increasing or decreasing tendency with addition of otc it can be seen from fig 4b the relative abundances of actinobacteria cytophagia and spartobacteria increased with the increase of operation time in two reactors simultaneously and the relative abundances of γ proteobacteria sphingobacteriia δ proteobacteria and bacteroidia decreased with the operation time in the r1 and r2 reactors simultaneously the results showed that these microorganisms were mainly affected by the operation conditions meanwhile the β proteobacteria decreased in the r1 reactor and it was stable in the r2 reactor furthermore the clostridia and α proteobacteria decreased in the r1 reactor and increased in the r2 reactor these three kinds of microbes had advantages over other bacteria in the ags system and they would be resistant to otc previous results showed that the proportion of relative abundances of these microorganisms were larger under the higher antibiotic concentration which showed that they were indeed resistant rodriguez sanchez et al 2017 vyrides et al 2018 with the addition of otc drugs the relative abundance of flavobacteriia changed from 7 56 to 7 16 the trend in the r1 reactor was relatively stable however it gradually decreased from 15 21 to 5 04 in the r2 reactor and the relative abundance of verrucomicrobiae increased in the r1 reactor and decreased in the r2 that indicated the otc had a great effect on some microbes it can be seen that the increase or decrease trend of microbes were more obvious at class level such as the trend of α proteobacteria clostridia and β proteobacteria stable or increase after addition to otc which has useful to removal of otc but the flavobacteriia and verrucomicrobiaeare were greatly influenced by otc the result showed that the bacterial community of granules was dynamic but a pronounced shift in its structure occurred during otc feeding further analysis based on the top 29 genera in samples from the r1 and r2 reactors is presented in fig 4c the relative abundances of zoogloea decreased simultaneously in two reactors microbes with similar trends also included chryseobacterium pseudomonas and bdellovibrio and so on on the contrary luteolibacter and actinotignum were the representatives that increased at the same in two reactors and finally became the dominant microbes in the r1 and r2 reactors with the operation time some strains such as comamonas lactococcus and fluviicola exhibited the enrichment phenomenon in addition of otc in the r2 reactor which became the main functional bacteria for resisting otc the literature has reported the comamonas has strong degradation ability to naphthalene phenol salicylic acid and phthalic acid liu et al 2008 and the molecular structure of otc is similar to those of above compounds so it is speculated that the mechanism of the comamonas degraded otc is similar to those of above substances liu et al 2017 lactococcus played a vital role on keeping the stable of system operation wang et al 2018 fluviicola has also been reported to be resistant to multiple antibiotics and able to capture new antibiotic resistance genes han et al 2018 woyke et al 2011 li et al 2018b it is reported that these microbes can grow well under the pressure of antibiotics carlson et al 2015 caniça et al 2015 in summary the change of microbes in ags under long term otc selection pressure was a dynamic process which included the enrichment of drug resistant microbes and the microbes that gradually reduced or even disappeared under the pressure of otc the changing microbial populations during degradation of otc may result from cooperative or synergistic effects where the presence of one microbial population promotes growth of other specific types the interaction between different bacterial populations may play an important role in the degradation of organic matter and on the stability of the system 3 6 differences between enzymes and microorganisms in two reactors some studies have shown that the degradation of organic matter is mainly via co metabolism of microorganisms hedegaard et al 2018 li et al 2018c which includes a series of continuous enzymatic reactions so the role of enzymes cannot be ignored ely et al 1995 lucia et al 2018 the differences of enzymes in the r1 and r2 reactors are shown in fig 5 a the abscissa represents the type of enzyme and the ordinate represents the number of genes annotating the enzyme it can be seen from fig 5a compared with the r1 reactor the abundances of enzymes decreased in the r2 such as cbms ces and ghs these three kinds of enzymes play an important role in the chemical compound metabolism which are beneficial for maintenance of microbial activity boraston et al 2004 furtado et al 2018 nakamura et al 2017 cantarel et al 2009 lundemo et al 2014 however after the introduction of otc into the reactor the number of these enzymes decrease which indicate the otc inhibited activity of several enzymes the abundances of gts in the r2 reactor is greater than in the r1 and pls and aas abundances in both reactors are almost the same gts are related to the biosynthesis of antibiotics it can be glycosylated at the late stage of antibiotic biosynthesis and the activity of antibiotics was regulated by changing the location type and quantity of carbonyl group withers 2001 pls are a kind of enzymes that crack glycoside bonds at the c 4 site and remove an h atom from the c 5 site to produce an unsaturated product by trans elimination eckersley and berger 2018 aas can catalyze the oxidation reduction reaction of organic compounds and make them oxidized by oxygen and remove hydrogen from molecules kim et al 2015 2016 it is speculated that the gts pls and aas enzymes in the agsbr system may play an important role in the removal of otc in depth analysis of the predominant taxa was carried out by the lefse algorithm and illustrated the main differences between the r1 and r2 reactors fig 5b judging by statistically significant differences segata et al 2011 david et al 2014 seven biomarkers were found at an lda threshold of 3 0 fig 5c as showed in fig 5b the inner to outer circles correspond to kingdom to genus levels and taxa with significant differences in all samples are marked by a corresponding color and show a concrete taxon name and lda score in fig 5c the other layers of taxa might be important but did not show obvious differences in all samples at the class level the distinction between the r1 and r2 reactors was observed and confirmed the conclusion about the effect of the otc on microbial communities the differences are represented by colors of the most abundant biomarkers and each circle s diameter is proportional to the relative abundance of taxa lefse analysis revealed that sphingobacteriia and β proteobacteria are two kinds of microorganisms in both reactors with obvious difference at class level and the obvious difference microbes at order level are sphingobacteriales sphingomonadales burkholderiales and neisseriales at family level chitinophagaceae comamonadaceae neisseriaceae and so on are important microbes in the r2 reactor at genus level comamonas lactococcus fluviicola pedobacter acidovorax and so on in the r2 reactor are different with the r1 reactor the results showed that after the long term operation these microbes that obvious difference in the r1 and r2 reactors played an indispensable role in resisting otc 4 conclusions this study describes a biological technique for otc removal from sw using an ags in sbr the results showed that agsbr can effectively remove cod nh4 n tp and otc pollutants simultaneously which the removal rates were 98 0 90 0 97 9 and 89 0 respectively moreover the proportion of degradation in total removal amount of otc increased obviously in domesticated ags which was increased from 28 to 72 when the concentration of otc is 5 mg l a variety of degradation products were detected by mass spectrometry metagenome sequencing has shown that enzymes may play an indispensable role in microbial metabolism of otc such as gts pls aas in addition the dynamics of microbial community were investigated during long term otc pressure at phylum level proteobacteria actinobacteria and firmicutes were functional bacteria while at class level α proteobacteria clostridia and β proteobacteria were resistant to otc at genus level comamonas lactococcus fluviicola and so on became functional bacteria declaration of interest statement all

core biological secondary treatment units of wwtps involving activated sludge are composed of open microbiomes comprising complex networks of microbial populations weissbrodt et al 2014 the microbial communities of wwtps are considered as hotspots for horizontal gene transfer hgt and putative proliferation of amr berendonk et al 2015 rizzo et al 2013 therefore in the last years several studies in different countries have evaluated the fate of args in full scale wwtps czekalski et al 2012 makowska et al 2016 rafraf et al 2016 rodriguez mozaz et al 2014 whereas most studies have detected lower absolute concentrations of args after treatment inconsistent results have been found on changes in the concentration of args relative to 16s rrna relative abundance lee et al 2017 makowska et al 2016 rafraf et al 2016 many factors might be the cause of this disparity including changes in community composition along with the treatment the presence of amr selective agents in the wastewater as well as the sampling design moreover up to date studies have rarely investigated the relationship between the efficiency of arg removal and the process design and operational conditions of wwtps one approach has been to evaluate possible relations between the presence or removal of args and water quality parameters as temperature total organic carbon toc bod nutrients and tss ben et al 2017 di cesare et al 2016 laht et al 2014 novo et al 2013 even though some correlations were found e g between temperature and sulfonamide arb or between toc and ermb teta and qnrs args these results did not universally apply to all investigated args and are based on a low number of investigated wwtps regarding the operation of the plant most of the recent studies focus on assessing or comparing the efficiency of advanced treatments or disinfection technologies such as biological post filtration or disinfection by chlorination uv or peracetic acid di cesare et al 2016 laht et al 2014 in order to limit the emissions of args to surface water information on the efficiency of wwtp treatment and the role of plant processes is needed therefore the aim of our study was 1 to evaluate the presence and removal of args and mges in dutch wwtps and investigate changes in the relative gene abundance and to elucidate 2 the influence of catchment area factors on loads of args and mges in raw wastewater as well as 3 the role of wwtp process configurations for their removal a selected panel of six relevant args berendonk et al 2015 and two mobile genetic elements mges related with amr intl1 and korb incp 1 plasmids were analyzed across an extended number of 62 treatment plants moreover information regarding the presence of possible explanatory variables in the catchment area i e healthcare institutions the amount of treated water during the sampling day hydraulic load and the design configuration and operational parameters of the wwtps were gathered the correlation of process and or catchment parameters with arg abundance and removals was studied with linear mixed models 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the selected wastewater treatment plants and sampling procedure influent and effluent samples were collected in 62 dutch wwtps distributed across the country fig s1 in the supplementary information the selected plants comprised varied sizes 4 800 1 060 500 population equivalents pe measured as 150g tod and different process configurations table s1 in the supplementary information no installation with advanced treatment was included the sampling was performed at a single time point per plant within the period dating from april to november of 2016 detailed information about the sampling points and sampling procedures can be found elsewhere schmitt 2017 briefly 24 h flow proportional composite samples were gathered from the influent and the effluent of the wwtps samples were processed within 24 h upon collection as follows a total of 30 ml of influent and 250 ml of effluent were filtered through 0 45 μm ester cellulose membranes merk millipore de and filters were frozen at 20 c until extraction 2 2 dna extraction and quantification of args and mges by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr dna filters were extracted with the dneasy kit power water qiagen nl following the manufacturer s instructions dna quantification and purification were determined by fluorometry using qubit thermofisher us the diluted dna was subjected to quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr analysis of the selected panel of genes the 16s rrna gene was selected as a proxy to quantify total bacteria qpcr targets were chosen from a proposed target panel to track args berendonk et al 2015 the chosen args confer resistance to the antibiotics with the highest consumption in the netherlands namely macrolides ermb tetracyclines tetm sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 fluoroquinolones qnrs and extended spectrum beta lactamases bla ctxm table 1 moreover two genes assessing the presence of mges were included in the study inti1 and korb the first target allows detecting integrase of class i integron a well known mge related to the acquisition and exchange of args through hgt events inti1 may also act as a marker for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 the second korb gene targets plasmids belonging to incompatibility group p 1 jechalke et al 2013 that are another kind of mges associated with arg and serve as models to study hgt events in complex environmental samples klümper et al 2015 tsutsui et al 2010 further information about oligonucleotides probes reaction mix and conditions can be found in the supplementary information and table s2 2 3 catchment area and wwtp metadata for statistical analyses information about healthcare institutions was obtained from a separate project schmitt 2017 in brief information on localization of hospitals and polyclinics was obtained from a registry of dutch

statistiek cbs 2018 https www cbs nl en gb the list of parameters taken into account for statistical analysis is summarized in table 2 2 4 statistical analyses statistical analyses were performed with r 3 4 4 r core team 2018 and rstudio https www rstudio com correlation analysis pearson s correlation between the removal of args mges 16s rrna and the fecal indicator bacteria escherichia coli were performed with the package corrplot wei and simko 2016 the data regarding e coli removal was obtained from a previous study schmitt 2017 for the analysis of the relation of the absolute resistance gene concentrations in the wwtp s influent to catchment area factors the log transformed absolute concentration of 8 genes per liter of influent was set as the outcome variable bla ctx m was excluded from the statistical analysis as the data set was not complete this gene was found below the detection limit in 10 of the wwtps effluent samples explanatory variables tested included the presence of hospitals polyclinics and nursing homes in the catchment area as well as the effect of rainfall events increasing the hydraulic load amount of water processed of the wwtp during the sampling day we named this variable hydraulic load factor and it was calculated as the ratio of the daily flow df during the sampling day over the average daily flow derived from the annual flow and expressed as times x adf we used the annual flow as the dry weather flow dwf was not known for all plants the hydraulic load factors observed in the 62 studied wwtp fall well within the distribution of hydraulic load factors retrieved from daily flows of two exemplary individual wwtp over two years and are therefore representative for dutch conditions data not shown a linear mixed model involving the r packages lme4 and lmertest to determine p values through satterthwaite approximation bates et al 2016 kuznetsova et al 2017 was used with the genes and the hydraulic load factor and area parameters as fixed factors and a random intercept for the plant identity parameters were first tested univariably including testing for interaction between gene identity and the other factors then the mumin package barton 2018 was used for the identification of the best minimum adequate models by fitting all possible submodels using maximum likelihood methods and ranking them by the corrected akaike information criterion aicc retaining all models differing from the best model by less than an aicc of 2 demonstration of single best models was chosen instead of model averaging dormann et al 2018 the quality of the model was investigated by visually inspecting normality of the residuals for the analysis of the influence of plant parameters on the removal efficiency the outcome variable was the log transformed removal efficiency per gene per plant i e the log reduction variables tested included the following size of the plant based on 150 g tod pe presence absence of primary sedimentation in combination with recirculation of dewatered sludge type of p removal none biological or biological and chemical average sludge retention time srt average hydraulic retention time hrt anaerobic contact time and the average concentration of total suspended solids tss in effluent as denitrification was applied in all plants it was not included in the statistical analysis a linear mixed model was used with the resistance gene and the plant parameters as fixed factors and a random intercept for the plant identity in the first step all parameters were tested in bivariate models gene and plant parameter and the significance of the interaction between genes and parameters was determined to adjust for the effect of the hydraulic load factor which was found to be highly significant trivariate models were run including the following three explanatory factors gene hydraulic load factor and their interaction in addition to one additional parameter finally all parameters gene hydraulic load factor and their interaction the presence of primary settler with and without sludge recirculation type of p removal hrt srt and tss were tested in a full model the anaerobic contact time was excluded from this model since data on the design of this parameter was only available for 11 out of the 62 wwtps the mumin package barton 2018 was used for model reduction i e identification of the best submodels of this model using maximum likelihood methods choosing the models differing from the best model by less than 2 aicc the model reduction was performed on a subset of 37 plants with complete observations the identified minimum adequate submodels were then re run for the largest set of wwtp for which all relevant data was available the quality of the model was investigated through analysis of normality of the residuals collinearity amongst explanatory variables was assessed by variance inflation factors 3 results and discussion 3 1 prevalence of args and mges in the influent and role of the catchment area we assessed the occurrence of different args and mges in the influent of 62 wwtp our results summarized in fig 1 and table s3 in the supplementary information showed that the most predominant genes in the influent were the args sul1 ermb and the mge inti1 6 54 log copies ml 1 on average the concentrations of tetm sul2 qnrs and mge korb were on average 10 times lower while the lowest concentrations 4 40 log copies ml 1 were obtained for the beta lactamase gene bla ctxm these findings are in general accordance with the concentrations found in other european studies by czekalski et al 2012 rodriguez mozaz et al 2014 and di cesare et al 2016 but 2 3 logs lower than the ones found in other northern european countries laht et al 2014 table s3 the resistance to sulfonamides sul1 sul2 and macrolides ermb seem to be most wide spread although the use of these antibiotics in humans is not so extensive anymore 10 of the total antibiotic consumption in humans in 2016 nethmap maran 2018 their high prevalence may be the result of the combination of prolonged use of these antibiotics in both humans and animal husbandry their association with mges baran et al 2011 davies and davies 2010 and the presence of residues from these antibiotic families in wastewater schmitt et al 2016 the possible contribution of healthcare institutions to the args and mges levels in influent of wwtps was also investigated in this study we found a small effect of the presence of hospitals on concentrations of resistance genes in influent while the presence of hospitals was included in all best models indicating a possible role of hospitals as point sources of resistance the increase in gene concentrations in influents due to presence of hospital wastewater was relatively small 0 10 log unit and hospital presence was not significant within these models the effects of the presence of care homes and polyclinics were yet lower table 3 and fig s2 in the supplementary information the role of healthcare institutions as an important source of antibiotic resistance emissions bacteria and genes into the sewer system has been already demonstrated in previous studies buelow et al 2018 lorenzo et al 2018 rodriguez mozaz et al 2014 however despite the elevated concentrations of args in healthcare sewage systems as compared to community or industry wastewater healthcare institutions discharges are estimated to represent just 1 of the total influent volume kümmerer 2009 schmitt 2017 thus the contribution of healthcare institutions wastewater was likely too small to increase the overall concentration of the genes tested in wwtp influents similar conclusions were recently drawn by buelow et al 2018 rainfall occurring on the sampling date increasing the hydraulic load factor was found to decrease the concentration of args in the influent slightly this was likely a consequence of the dilution of human waste in the sewer with the rainfall inflow metcalf and eddy 2003 still the effect of rainfall on the gene prevalence 0 11 logs per time adf was doubled was not significant by itself table 3 and fig s3 in the supplementary information these results could be explained by the homogenizing effect of the 24 h composite samples that would include wastewater from both rainshowers but also the dry period such an effect was also observed by lucas et al 2014 while monitoring fecal indicator bacteria in two wwtps in paris besides the variability in both catchment area characteristics and the rainfall events could also have influenced the magnitude of the effect as was previously observed for fecal indicators and args in influent and combine sewers overflows eramo et al 2017 lucas et al 2014 3 2 args and mge removal efficiencies in the wwtps studied the average removal of args was similar or higher than the average removal of total bacteria measured as 16s rrna gene fig 1 table s3 meaning that the average relative abundance of args after treatment did not increase fig 2 and table s4 in the supplementary information we observed a 1 76 0 40 log reduction for 16s which implies a decrease of 98 2 on average the highest removal rates were observed for qnrs ermb and tetm genes 2 65 0 68 2 65 0 74 2 53 0 68 average log reduction respectively for bla ctxm 16 of the effluent samples had concentrations below the detection limit and the average removal excluding those samples was 2 44 0 56 logs the sul2 removal was 2 00 0 48 log copies and closer to the 16s rrna gene removal was sul1 with 1 82 0 53 log copies reduction similar values were obtained for the mge inti1 1 80 0 49 these results are comparable or better to those obtained in wwtps including advance treatments or disinfection processes di cesare et al 2016 laht et al 2014 wen et al 2016 as described in table s3 on the other hand lower average reduction than the 16s rrna gene was observed for the korb gene with 0 89 0 60 log removal 87 2 meaning that the relative abundance of this gene was significantly increased p 0 001 after the treatment fig 2 table s4 since broad host range plasmids as incp 1 are known to disseminate into a great variety of environmental bacteria families their removal might be countered by hgt events bellanger et al 2014 klümper et al 2015 in addition incp 1 plasmids often include genes that encode for metal resistance and the degradation of xenobiotic compounds thus conferring metabolic advantages to bacteria in activated sludge and likely enhancing their dissemination dröge et al 2000 the presence of incp 1 plasmids in wwtps has been previously investigated by culturing and molecular based techniques bahl et al 2009 moura et al 2010 but to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that their occurrence has been quantified revealing an increase in their relative abundance after wastewater treatment generally it can be concluded that dutch wwtps do not contribute to enhancing antimicrobial resistance the absolute concentration of the tested args and of inti1 genes decreased on average 98 4 99 8 after treatment besides the average relative abundance of args either decreased or remained identical although a slight relative increase was found in some plants for sul1 sul2 and inti1 table s1 most of the available studies agree that wwtps reduce the absolute numbers of both total bacteria and args in wastewater yet the effect of treatment on the relative arg abundance differs greatly depending on the studied genes for instance munir et al 2011 and laht et al 2014 reported a decrease or no change in the relative abundance of the tested args on the other hand other authors observed relative enrichment of some of the tested args di cesare et al 2016 lee et al 2017 makowska et al 2016 rodriguez mozaz et al 2014 moreover rafraf et al 2016 found an increase of up to 0 50 2 40 logs in the absolute concentration of some args after treatment the decrease of absolute and relative abundance of args found in this study might be the result of the combination of the low human use of antibiotics in the netherlands possibly limiting selective pressures of these substances in sewage together with continuous surveillance and upgrading of the dutch wastewater facilities despite the average of 2 30 0 30 log removal of resistance genes dutch wwtps still release approximately 106 arg copies per liter of effluent the impact of the discharge of arg containing effluent on the receiving waterbodies was not evaluated in this study but it has been addressed elsewhere lapara et al 2015 marti et al 2013 rodriguez mozaz et al 2014 sabri et al 2018 in most of the cases the discharge of wwtps effluents increases the args content in the receiving aquatic ecosystems this illustrates that human exposure to arg emitted from wwtp is possible e g through recreation in surface waters the exact public health burden of the presence of specific resistance genes in surface water is difficult to quantify however recreational exposure has been linked with higher esbl carriage in surfers leonard et al 2018 3 3 removal of args as compared to mges 16s rrna gene and e coli the removal of all args and mges was positively correlated with the removal of the 16s rrna gene r 0 68 0 87 fig 3 moreover a strong and significant correlation was observed between the removal of ermb and tetm r 0 96 p 0 001 this could be explained by their typical co location on diverse transposon families brenciani et al 2007 that are usually present in gram positive bacteria mainly in the order lactobacillales park et al 2010 these bacteria are common fecal microorganisms present in the wastewater influent and in general they are partially removed during wwtp treatment cai et al 2014 the removal of another type of fecal bacteria escherichia coli was also significantly correlated with the decrease of the beta lactam gene bla ctx m r 0 79 p 0 01 in accordance with the co location of these genes in enterobacteriaceae bradford 2001 sul1 and inti1 proved to be correlated in their persistence r 0 92 p 0 001 in line with the co location of sul1 on class 1 integrons inti1 their resilience to treatment may be due to their association with diverse broad host range plasmids that are horizontally transferred among diverse bacteria gillings et al 2015 3 4 influence of the design and process parameters of wwtps in the efficiency of args and mges removal the impact of specific treatment processes on gene removal as included in table 2 was studied by statistical analysis linear mixed models these analyses were run both with and without the korb gene as this was the only gene for which the relative abundance increased during wastewater treatment suggesting a different effect of the treatment dynamics than for the rest of the gene panel our results show that an increase of the hydraulic load factor caused by rainfall events was the dominant variable explaining differences in reduction of args and mges between the plants significant effect in the univariate and most multivariate models both with and without korb fig 4 table 4 table 5 tables s5 and s6 in the supplementary information on average the efficiency was reduced by 0 38 logs per time the adf was exceeded therefore rainfall reduced the incoming loads of args in influent as well as the efficiency of their removal during treatment yet only the latter was found to be statistically significant wwtps are usually optimally operated in the so called dry weather flow here represented by the adf while wastewater volumes up to a maximum flow of 3 6 times the dwf conditions can be processed epa 1995 a higher hydraulic load can disturb the treatment processes these disturbances are mainly related to the reduction of the wwtp s optimal hrt and differences in the influent composition metcalf and eddy 2003 in the secondary treatment shorter hrts and different influent composition physical and biochemical can affect both biomass growth and the dynamics of biological processes resulting in poorer treatment performance capodaglio 2007 no significant effects of hrts on removal rates were found in the univariate analysis and only a slight effect of hrt was found in multivariate analyses hrt was included in a few of the best adequate models but not significant in itself the increase in removal with 1 h hrt was limited in all these models to 0 01 log gene copies yet shorter hrt occurring during higher hydraulic loads on the sampling day likely contributed to poorer treatment efficiency when the increase in the hydraulic load is intense or lasts for a long period it can cause washing out of activated sludge leading to an increase in total suspended solids tss including bacteria and args in the effluent capodaglio 2007 rouleau et al 1997 tss in effluent could also be increased by increasing tss in the influents caused by rainfall events mines et al 2007 in this study effluent s tss were only marginally influencing args removal in multivariate analysis and not significant in univariate analysis table 4 this was likely due to the use of annual average tss values therefore not reflecting the sampling day however tss values from the sampling day were not significantly correlated with the concentrations of args in effluents in a recent study ben et al 2017 those samplings were performed under dry weather conditions though therefore the association between tss and wwtp s removal efficiency during rainy weather events still remains unclear and it is advisable to investigate the influence of this parameter in future studies average srt only slightly affected gene removal in multivariate analysis and was not significant in the univariate analysis the srt is optimized in each plant to achieve the best conditions for nutrient removal smith et al 2014 although higher srts have shown to improve the removal of pharmaceuticals de sotto et al 2016 its effect on arb and args removal is still controversial and restricted to bench scale studies de sotto et al 2016 neyestani et al 2017 higher srt might favor the grazing of bacteria by protozoa but on the other hand it might also favor hgt events tsutsui et al 2010 moreover we also evaluated the effect of primary sedimentation processes these are meant to reduce debris tss and bod by mechanical and or settling procedures puig et al 2010 bacteria associated with such particles might be removed during primary settling however such an effect may be masked by primary settlers receiving recirculated water from thickeners and dewatering digested sludge that contains high amounts of args gao et al 2012 in our study the presence of primary sedimentation with and without recirculation of digested sludge seemed to result in slightly decreased arg removal this appeared from the inclusion of this parameter in two best models retrieved on a subset of the data with complete observations albeit these parameters not being significant in themselves table 4 and table s5 however when this statistical model was repeated on the full dataset the effect of primary sedimentation with and without recirculation of digested sludge was less pronounced i e the estimates were numerically smaller and the p values higher table 5 and table s6 lastly the effects of the remaining design and operational wwtps parameters investigated table 2 were not statistically significant namely the size of the plant and the type of p removal chemical or biological table 4 thus the increased hydraulic load caused by rainfall remains the single clear parameter of the dataset determining the arg removal the simplest model describing resistance gene reduction therefore includes the hydraulic load only table s7 in the supplementary information according to this model ermb sul2 qnrs and tetm are removed significantly more efficiently than 16s rrna while korb increases in relative abundance the effect of the hydraulic load on the removal efficiency differs per gene qnrs tetm and ermb are significantly better removed at higher hydraulic load as compared to 16s rrna 0 69 to 0 83 logs per time adf was doubled table s7 3 5 the challenge of comparing and anticipating treatment efficiencies albeit an increasing number of studies addressing amr in wwtps in the last decade no conventional treatment or operational strategy has been identified that can improve arg removal unlike in laboratory approaches full scale studies involve dozens of variables at once effects caused by parameters that are targeted in a specific study can be masked by others environmental design as the majority of the available studies include relatively few locations from 1 to 5 wwtps meta analyses might be used to aggregate data from single studies and more sensitively identify explanatory factors for arg removal however some studies do neither gather nor include crucial metadata about plant design and operational parameters along with the sampling campaign preferably the collected parameters should be specific for the sampling dates rather than representing average values in any case cooperation with water authorities in both the sampling design and the evaluation of the results might ease the access to operational process information furthermore the comparison of results between studies is not always possible since the args assessed often differ this might be helped by a consensus panel of args such as suggested by berendonk et al 2015 which was used in this work additionally not all studies report both reductions in absolute concentrations and reduction of the relative abundance of args normalized to the 16s rrna gene the absolute args concentrations in influent or discharged effluents provide valuable information for risk assessments and to estimate the plant performance on the other hand relative abundance is relevant to point to possible selective processes within the plant integrating each of the aforementioned points into future studies would help to build a comprehensive data frame that might result in a better understanding of the efficiency of arg removal in wastewater treatment 4 conclusions from an analysis of the influent concentrations and the removal of args in a large number of wwtps in the netherlands we conclude that from the studied args sul1 sulfonamide resistance and ermb macrolide resistance are the most predominant resistance genes in the influent of wwtps the presence of known sources of amr in catchment areas namely healthcare institutions hospitals nursing homes or polyclinics only marginally influences concentrations of args and mges in influent of municipal wwtps conventional wwtp treatments significantly decreased the absolute numbers of total bacteria and the investigated args by 1 76 2 65 logs moreover the treatment did not increase the relative abundance of the tested args however dutch wwtps still discharge on average 106 copies of args per liter of effluent to the receiving water bodies this study quantifies for the first time incp 1 plasmids measured as korb gene in wastewater samples finding that its relative abundance significantly increased after wwtp treatment rainfall causing an increase in the usual wwtp hydraulic load marginally reduced the amount of incoming args but significantly reduced the wwtp s removal efficiency of the args and inti1 wwtp design parameters as size presence of primary clarification type of p removal and operational parameters as hrt srt anaerobic contact time and effluent tss were not found to affect the removal of the studied args and mges significantly however the use of average annual data instead of actual data on the sampling day for some of these parameters probably masked their possible effect acknowledgments we would like to thank all the dutch waterboards and wwtp operators for their collaboration in the sampling collection we also warmly

18697,wastewater treatment plants wwtps linking human fecal residues and the environment are considered as hotspots for the spread of antimicrobial resistance amr in order to evaluate the role of wwtps and underlying operational parameters for the removal of amr the presence and removal efficiency of a selected set of 6 antimicrobial resistance genes args and 2 mobile genetic elements mges was evaluated by means of qpcr in influent and effluent samples from 62 dutch wwtps the role of possible factors impacting the concentrations of args and mges in the influent and their removal was identified through statistical analysis args and the class i integron integrase gene inti1 were on average removed to a similar extent 1 76 log reduction or better 0 30 1 90 logs than the total

significantly p 0 05 affected the treatment efficiency by decreasing it on average 0 38 logs per time the flow exceeded the average daily flow our results suggest that overall wwtp treatments do not

although it is a natural and ancient phenomenon d costa et al 2011 its occurrence in natural environments has been accelerated by anthropogenic activities one of the essential vectors for the dissemination of human related amrs into the environment is wastewater as it collects fecal residues including antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and their genes args baquero et al 2008 in europe wastewater is treated in wastewater treatment plants wwtps and their effluents are commonly discharged into natural water bodies the main goal of sewage treatment is to remove organic components measured as chemical cod and biological bod oxygen demand phosphorus and nitrogen nutrients p n as well as suspended solids but not bacteria or their genes council of the european communities 1991 the core biological secondary treatment units of wwtps involving activated sludge are composed of open microbiomes comprising complex networks of microbial populations weissbrodt et al 2014 the microbial communities of wwtps are considered as hotspots for horizontal gene transfer hgt and putative proliferation of amr berendonk et al 2015 rizzo et al 2013 therefore in the last years several studies in different countries have evaluated the fate of args in full scale wwtps czekalski et al 2012 makowska et al 2016 rafraf et al 2016 rodriguez mozaz et al 2014 whereas most studies have detected lower absolute concentrations of args after treatment inconsistent results have been found on changes in the concentration of args relative to 16s rrna relative abundance lee et al 2017 makowska et al 2016 rafraf et al 2016 many factors might be the cause of this disparity including changes in community composition along with the treatment the presence of amr selective agents in the wastewater as well as the sampling design moreover up to date studies have rarely investigated the relationship between the efficiency of arg removal and the process design and operational conditions of wwtps one approach has been to evaluate possible relations between the presence or removal of args and water quality parameters as temperature total organic carbon toc bod nutrients and tss ben et al 2017 di cesare et al 2016 laht et al 2014 novo et al 2013 even though some correlations were found e g between temperature and sulfonamide arb or between toc and ermb teta and qnrs args these results did not universally apply to all investigated args and are based on a low number of investigated wwtps regarding the operation of the plant most of the recent studies focus on assessing or comparing the efficiency of advanced treatments or disinfection technologies such as biological post filtration or disinfection by chlorination uv or peracetic acid di cesare et al 2016 laht et al 2014 in order to limit the emissions of args to surface water information on the efficiency of wwtp treatment and the role of plant processes is needed therefore the aim of our study was 1 to evaluate the presence and removal of args and mges in dutch wwtps and investigate changes in the relative gene abundance and to elucidate 2 the influence of catchment area factors on loads of args and mges in raw wastewater as well as 3 the role of wwtp process configurations for their removal a selected panel of six relevant args berendonk et al 2015 and two mobile genetic elements mges related with amr intl1 and korb incp 1 plasmids were analyzed across an extended number of 62 treatment plants moreover information regarding the presence of possible explanatory variables in the catchment area i e healthcare institutions the amount of treated water during the sampling day hydraulic load and the design configuration and operational parameters of the wwtps were gathered the correlation of process and or catchment parameters with arg abundance and removals was studied with linear mixed models 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of the selected wastewater treatment plants and sampling procedure

population equivalents pe measured as 150g tod and different process configurations table s1 in the supplementary information no installation with advanced treatment was included the sampling was performed at a single time point per plant within the period dating from april to november of 2016 detailed information about the sampling points and sampling procedures can be found elsewhere schmitt 2017 briefly 24 h flow proportional composite samples were gathered from the influent and the effluent of the wwtps samples were processed within 24 h upon collection as follows a total of 30 ml of influent and 250 ml of effluent were filtered through 0 45 μm ester cellulose membranes merk millipore de and filters were frozen at 20 c until extraction 2 2 dna extraction and quantification of args and mges by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr dna filters were extracted with the dneasy kit power water qiagen nl following the manufacturer s instructions dna quantification and purification were determined by fluorometry using qubit thermofisher us the diluted dna was subjected to quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr analysis of the selected panel of genes the 16s rrna gene was selected as a proxy to quantify total bacteria qpcr targets were chosen from a proposed target panel to track args berendonk et al 2015 the chosen args confer resistance to the antibiotics with the highest consumption in the netherlands namely macrolides ermb tetracyclines tetm sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 fluoroquinolones qnrs and extended spectrum beta lactamases bla ctxm table 1 moreover two genes assessing the presence of mges were included in the study inti1 and korb the first target allows detecting integrase of class i integron a well known mge related to the acquisition and exchange of args through hgt events inti1 may also act as a marker for anthropogenic pollution gillings et al 2015 the second korb gene targets plasmids belonging to incompatibility group p 1 jechalke et al 2013 that are another kind of mges associated with arg and serve as models to study hgt events in complex environmental samples klümper et al 2015 tsutsui et al 2010 further information about oligonucleotides probes reaction mix and conditions can be found in the supplementary information and table s2 2 3 catchment area and wwtp metadata for statistical analyses information about healthcare institutions was obtained from a separate project schmitt 2017 in brief information on localization of hospitals and polyclinics was obtained from a registry of dutch health data maintained by the national institute for public health and the environment www volksgezondheidenzorg info and amended with a separate list of dutch hospitals https nl wikipedia org wiki

from the corresponding waterboards or wwtps detailed information about plant design and performance parameters for the wwtps in 2016 was obtained through the dutch statistical office central bureau statistiek cbs 2018 https www cbs nl en gb the list of parameters taken into account for statistical analysis is summarized in table 2 2 4 statistical analyses statistical analyses were performed with r 3 4 4 r core team 2018 and rstudio https www rstudio com correlation analysis pearson s correlation between the removal of args mges 16s rrna and the fecal indicator bacteria escherichia coli were performed with the package corrplot wei and simko 2016 the data regarding e coli removal was obtained from a previous study schmitt 2017 for the analysis of the relation of the absolute resistance gene concentrations in the wwtp s influent to catchment area factors the log transformed absolute concentration of 8 genes per liter of influent was set as the outcome variable bla ctx m was excluded from the statistical analysis as the data set was not complete this gene was found below the detection limit in 10 of the wwtps effluent samples explanatory variables tested included the presence of hospitals polyclinics and nursing homes in the catchment area as well as the effect of rainfall events increasing the hydraulic load amount of water processed of the wwtp during the sampling day we named this variable hydraulic load factor and it was calculated as the ratio of the daily flow df during the sampling day over the average daily flow derived from the annual flow and expressed as times x adf we used the annual flow as the dry weather flow dwf was not known for all plants the hydraulic load factors observed in the 62 studied wwtp fall well within the distribution of hydraulic load factors retrieved from daily flows of two exemplary individual wwtp over two years and are therefore representative for dutch conditions data not shown a linear mixed model involving the r packages lme4 and lmertest to determine p values through satterthwaite approximation bates et al 2016 kuznetsova et al 2017 was used with the genes and the hydraulic load factor and area parameters as fixed factors and a random intercept for the plant identity parameters were first tested univariably including testing for interaction between gene identity and the other factors then the mumin package barton 2018 was used for the identification of the best minimum adequate models by fitting all possible submodels using maximum likelihood methods and ranking them by the corrected akaike information criterion aicc retaining all models differing from the best model by less than an aicc of 2 demonstration of single best models was chosen instead of model averaging dormann et al 2018 the quality of the model was investigated by visually inspecting normality of the residuals for the analysis of the influence of plant parameters on the removal efficiency the outcome variable was the log transformed removal efficiency per gene per plant i e the log reduction variables tested included the following size of the plant based on 150 g tod pe presence absence of primary sedimentation in combination with recirculation of dewatered sludge type of p removal none biological or biological and chemical average sludge retention time srt average hydraulic retention time hrt anaerobic contact time and the average concentration of total suspended solids tss in effluent as denitrification was applied in all plants it was not included in the statistical analysis a linear mixed model was used with the resistance gene and the plant parameters as fixed factors and a random intercept for the plant identity in the first step all parameters were tested in bivariate models gene and plant parameter and the significance of the interaction between genes and parameters was determined to adjust for the effect of the hydraulic load factor which was found to be highly significant trivariate models were run including the following three explanatory factors gene hydraulic load factor and their interaction in addition to one additional parameter finally all parameters gene hydraulic load factor and their interaction the presence of primary settler with and without sludge recirculation type of p removal hrt srt and tss were tested in a full model the anaerobic contact time was excluded from this model since data on the design of this parameter was only available for 11 out of the 62 wwtps the mumin package barton 2018 was used for model reduction i e identification of the best submodels of this model using maximum likelihood methods choosing the models differing from the best model by less than 2 aicc the model reduction was performed on a subset of 37 plants with complete observations the identified minimum adequate submodels were then re run for the largest set of wwtp for which all relevant data was available the quality of the model was investigated through analysis of normality of the residuals collinearity amongst explanatory variables was assessed by variance inflation factors 3 results and discussion 3 1 prevalence of args and mges in the influent and role of the catchment area we assessed the occurrence of different args and mges in the influent of 62 wwtp our results summarized in fig 1 and table s3 in the supplementary information showed that the most predominant genes in the influent were the args sul1 ermb and the mge inti1 6 54 log copies ml 1 on average the concentrations of tetm sul2 qnrs and mge korb were on average 10 times lower while the lowest concentrations 4 40 log copies ml 1 were obtained for the beta lactamase gene bla ctxm these findings are in general accordance with the concentrations found in other european studies by czekalski et al 2012 rodriguez mozaz et al 2014 and di cesare et al 2016 but 2 3 logs lower than the ones found in other northern european countries laht et al 2014 table s3 the resistance to sulfonamides sul1 sul2 and macrolides ermb seem to be most wide spread although the use of these antibiotics in humans is not so extensive anymore 10 of the total antibiotic consumption in humans in 2016 nethmap maran 2018 their high prevalence may be the result of the combination of prolonged use of these antibiotics in both humans and animal husbandry their association with mges baran et al 2011 davies and davies 2010 and the presence of residues from these antibiotic families in wastewater schmitt et al 2016 the possible contribution of healthcare institutions to the args and mges levels in influent of wwtps was also investigated in this study we found a small effect of the presence of hospitals on concentrations of resistance genes in influent while the presence of hospitals was included in all best models indicating a possible role of hospitals as point sources of resistance the increase in gene concentrations in influents due to presence of hospital wastewater was relatively small 0 10 log unit and hospital presence was not significant within these models the effects of the presence of care homes and polyclinics were yet lower table 3 and fig s2 in the supplementary information the role of healthcare institutions as an important source of antibiotic resistance emissions bacteria and genes into the sewer system has been already demonstrated in previous studies buelow et al 2018 lorenzo et al 2018 rodriguez mozaz et al 2014 however despite the elevated concentrations of args in healthcare sewage systems as compared to community or industry wastewater healthcare institutions discharges are estimated to represent just 1 of the total influent volume kümmerer 2009 schmitt 2017 thus the contribution of healthcare institutions wastewater was likely too small to increase the overall concentration of the genes tested in wwtp influents similar conclusions were recently drawn by buelow et al 2018 rainfall occurring on the sampling date increasing the hydraulic load factor was found to decrease the concentration of args in the influent slightly this was likely a consequence of the dilution of human waste in the sewer with the rainfall inflow metcalf and eddy 2003 still the effect of rainfall on the gene prevalence 0 11 logs per time adf was doubled was not significant by itself table 3 and fig s3 in the supplementary information these results could be explained by the homogenizing effect of the 24 h composite samples that would include wastewater from both rainshowers but also the dry period such an effect was also observed by lucas et al 2014 while monitoring fecal indicator bacteria in two wwtps in paris besides the variability in both catchment area characteristics and the rainfall events could also have influenced the magnitude of the effect as was previously observed for fecal indicators and args in influent and combine sewers overflows eramo et al 2017 lucas et al 2014 3 2 args and mge removal efficiencies in the wwtps studied the average removal of args was similar or higher than the average removal of total bacteria measured as 16s rrna gene fig 1 table s3 meaning that the average relative abundance of args after treatment did not increase fig 2 and table s4 in the supplementary information we observed a 1 76 0 40 log reduction for 16s which implies a decrease of 98 2 on average the highest removal rates were observed for qnrs ermb and tetm genes 2 65 0 68 2 65 0 74 2 53 0 68 average log reduction respectively for bla ctxm 16 of the effluent samples had concentrations below the detection limit and the average removal excluding those samples was 2 44 0 56 logs the sul2 removal was 2 00 0 48 log copies and closer to the 16s rrna gene removal was sul1 with 1 82 0 53 log copies reduction similar values were obtained for the mge inti1 1 80 0 49 these results are comparable or better to those obtained in wwtps including advance treatments or disinfection processes di cesare et al 2016 laht et al 2014 wen et al 2016 as described in table s3 on the other hand lower average reduction than the 16s rrna gene was observed for the korb gene with 0 89 0 60 log removal 87 2 meaning that the relative abundance of this gene was significantly increased p 0 001 after the treatment fig 2 table s4 since broad host range plasmids as incp 1 are known to disseminate into a great variety of environmental bacteria families their removal might be countered by hgt events bellanger et al 2014 klümper et al 2015 in addition incp 1 plasmids often include genes that encode for metal resistance and the degradation of xenobiotic compounds thus conferring metabolic advantages to bacteria in activated sludge and likely enhancing their dissemination dröge et al 2000 the presence of incp 1 plasmids in wwtps has been previously investigated by culturing and molecular based techniques bahl et al 2009 moura et al 2010 but to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that their occurrence has been quantified revealing an increase in their relative abundance after wastewater treatment generally it can be concluded that dutch wwtps do not contribute to enhancing antimicrobial resistance the absolute concentration of the tested args and of inti1 genes decreased on average 98 4 99 8 after treatment besides the average relative abundance of args either decreased or remained identical although a slight relative increase was found in some plants for sul1 sul2 and inti1 table s1 most of the available studies agree that wwtps reduce the absolute numbers of both total bacteria and args in wastewater yet the effect of treatment on the relative arg abundance differs greatly depending on the studied genes for instance munir et al 2011 and laht et al 2014 reported a decrease or no change in the relative abundance of the tested args on the other hand other authors observed relative enrichment of some of the tested args di cesare et al 2016 lee et al 2017 makowska et al 2016 rodriguez mozaz et al 2014 moreover rafraf et al 2016 found an increase of up to 0 50 2 40 logs in the absolute concentration of some args after treatment the decrease of absolute and relative abundance of args found in this study might be the result of the combination of the low human use of antibiotics in the netherlands possibly limiting selective pressures of these substances in sewage together with continuous surveillance and upgrading of the dutch wastewater facilities despite the average of 2 30 0 30 log removal of resistance genes dutch wwtps still release approximately 106 arg copies per liter of effluent the impact of the discharge of arg containing effluent on the receiving waterbodies was not evaluated in this study but it has been addressed elsewhere lapara et al 2015 marti et al 2013 rodriguez mozaz et al 2014 sabri et al 2018 in most of the cases the discharge of wwtps effluents increases the args content in the receiving aquatic ecosystems this illustrates that human exposure to arg emitted from wwtp is possible e g through recreation in surface waters the exact public health burden of the presence of specific resistance genes in surface water is difficult to quantify however recreational exposure has been linked with higher esbl carriage in surfers leonard et al 2018 3 3 removal of args as compared to mges 16s rrna gene and e coli the removal of all args and mges was positively correlated with the removal of the 16s rrna gene r 0 68 0 87 fig 3 moreover a strong and significant correlation was observed between the removal of ermb and tetm r 0 96 p 0 001 this could be explained by their typical co location on diverse transposon families brenciani et al 2007 that are usually present in gram positive bacteria mainly in the order lactobacillales park et al 2010 these bacteria are common fecal microorganisms present in the wastewater influent and in general they are partially removed during wwtp treatment cai et al 2014 the removal of another type of fecal bacteria escherichia coli was also significantly correlated with the decrease of the beta lactam gene bla ctx m r 0 79 p 0 01 in accordance with the co location of these genes in enterobacteriaceae bradford 2001 sul1 and inti1 proved to be correlated in their persistence r 0 92 p 0 001 in line with the co location of sul1 on class 1 integrons inti1 their resilience to treatment may be due to their association with diverse broad host range plasmids that are horizontally transferred among diverse bacteria gillings et al 2015 3 4 influence of the design and process parameters of wwtps in the efficiency of args and mges removal the impact of specific treatment processes on gene removal as included in table 2 was studied by statistical analysis linear mixed models these analyses were run both with and without the korb gene as this was the only gene for which the relative abundance increased during wastewater treatment suggesting a different effect of the treatment dynamics than for the rest of the gene panel our results show that an increase of the hydraulic load factor caused by rainfall events was the dominant variable explaining differences in reduction of args and mges between the plants significant effect in the univariate and most multivariate models both with and without korb fig 4 table 4 table 5 tables s5 and s6 in the supplementary information on average the efficiency was reduced by 0 38 logs per time the adf was exceeded therefore rainfall reduced the incoming loads of args in influent as well as the efficiency of their removal during treatment yet only the latter was found to be statistically significant wwtps are usually optimally operated in the so called dry weather flow here represented by the adf while wastewater volumes up to a maximum flow of 3 6 times the dwf conditions can be processed epa 1995 a higher hydraulic load can disturb the treatment processes these disturbances are mainly related to the reduction of the wwtp s optimal hrt and differences in the influent composition metcalf and eddy 2003 in the secondary treatment shorter hrts and different influent composition physical and biochemical can affect both biomass growth and the dynamics of biological processes resulting in poorer treatment performance capodaglio 2007 no significant effects of hrts on removal rates were found in the univariate analysis and only a slight effect of hrt was found in multivariate analyses hrt was included in a few of the best adequate models but not significant in itself the increase in removal with 1 h hrt was limited in all these models to 0 01 log gene copies yet shorter hrt occurring during higher hydraulic loads on the sampling day likely contributed to poorer treatment efficiency when the increase in the hydraulic load is intense or lasts for a long period it can cause washing out of activated sludge leading to an increase in total suspended solids tss including bacteria and args in the effluent capodaglio 2007 rouleau et al 1997 tss in effluent could also be increased by increasing tss in the influents caused by rainfall events mines et al 2007 in this study effluent s tss were only marginally influencing args removal in multivariate analysis and not significant in univariate analysis table 4 this was likely due to the use of annual average tss values therefore not reflecting the sampling day however tss values from the sampling day were not significantly correlated with the concentrations of args in effluents in a recent study ben et al 2017 those samplings were performed under dry weather conditions though therefore the association between tss and wwtp s removal efficiency during rainy weather events still remains unclear and it is advisable to investigate the influence of this parameter in future studies average srt only slightly affected gene removal in multivariate analysis and was not significant in the univariate analysis the srt is optimized in each plant to achieve the best conditions for nutrient removal smith et al 2014 although higher srts have shown to improve the removal of pharmaceuticals de sotto et al 2016 its effect on arb and args removal is still controversial and restricted to bench scale studies de sotto et al 2016 neyestani et al 2017 higher srt might favor the grazing of bacteria by protozoa but on the other hand it might also favor hgt events tsutsui et al 2010 moreover we also evaluated the effect of primary sedimentation processes these are meant to reduce debris tss and bod by mechanical and or settling procedures puig et al 2010 bacteria associated with such particles might be removed during primary settling however such an effect may be masked by primary settlers receiving recirculated water from thickeners and dewatering digested sludge that contains high amounts of args gao et al 2012 in our study the presence of primary sedimentation with and without recirculation of digested sludge seemed to result in slightly decreased arg removal this appeared from the inclusion of this parameter in two best models retrieved on a subset of the data with complete observations albeit these parameters not being significant in themselves table 4 and table s5 however when this statistical model was repeated on the full dataset the effect of primary sedimentation with and without recirculation of digested sludge was less pronounced i e the estimates were numerically smaller and the p values higher table 5 and table s6 lastly the effects of the remaining design and operational wwtps parameters investigated table 2 were not statistically significant namely the size of the plant and the type of p removal chemical or biological table 4 thus the increased hydraulic load caused by rainfall remains the single clear parameter of the dataset determining the arg removal the simplest model describing resistance gene reduction therefore includes the hydraulic load only table s7 in the supplementary information according to this model ermb sul2 qnrs and tetm are removed significantly more efficiently than 16s rrna while korb increases in relative abundance the effect of the hydraulic load on the removal efficiency differs per gene qnrs tetm and ermb are significantly better removed at higher hydraulic load as compared to 16s rrna 0 69 to 0 83 logs per time adf was doubled table s7 3 5 the challenge of comparing and anticipating treatment efficiencies albeit an increasing number of studies addressing amr in wwtps in the last decade no conventional treatment or operational strategy has been identified that can improve arg removal unlike in laboratory approaches full scale studies involve dozens of variables at once effects caused by parameters that are targeted in a specific study can be masked by others environmental design as the majority of the available studies include relatively few locations from 1 to 5 wwtps meta analyses might be used to aggregate data from single studies and more sensitively identify explanatory factors for arg removal however some studies do neither gather nor include crucial metadata about plant design and operational parameters along with the sampling campaign preferably the collected parameters should be specific for the sampling dates rather than representing average values in any case cooperation with water authorities in both the sampling design and the evaluation of the results might ease the access to operational process information furthermore the comparison of results between studies is not always possible since the args assessed often differ this might be helped by a consensus panel of args such as suggested by berendonk et al 2015 which was used in this work additionally not all studies report both reductions in absolute concentrations and reduction of the relative abundance of args normalized to the 16s rrna gene the absolute args concentrations in influent or discharged effluents provide valuable information for risk assessments and to estimate the plant performance on the other hand relative abundance is relevant to point to possible selective processes within the plant integrating each of the aforementioned points into future studies would help to build a comprehensive data frame that might result in a better understanding of the efficiency of arg removal in wastewater treatment 4 conclusions from an analysis of the influent concentrations and the removal of args in a large number of wwtps in the netherlands we conclude that from the studied args sul1 sulfonamide resistance and ermb macrolide resistance are the most predominant resistance genes in the influent of wwtps the presence of known sources of amr in catchment areas namely healthcare institutions hospitals nursing homes or polyclinics only marginally influences concentrations of args and mges in influent of municipal wwtps conventional wwtp treatments significantly decreased the absolute numbers of total bacteria and the investigated args by 1 76 2 65 logs moreover the treatment did not increase the relative abundance of the tested args however dutch wwtps still discharge on average 106 copies of args per liter of effluent to the receiving water bodies this study quantifies for the first time incp 1 plasmids measured as korb gene in wastewater samples finding that its relative abundance significantly increased after wwtp treatment rainfall causing an increase in the usual wwtp hydraulic load marginally reduced the amount of incoming args but significantly reduced the wwtp s removal efficiency of the args and inti1 wwtp design parameters as size presence of primary clarification type of p removal and operational parameters as hrt srt anaerobic contact time and effluent tss were not found to affect the removal of the studied args and mges significantly however the use of average annual data instead of actual data on the sampling day for some of these parameters probably masked their possible effect acknowledgments we would like to thank all the dutch waterboards and wwtp operators for their collaboration in the sampling collection we also warmly

18698,anaerobic digestion ad is a technology for recovering chemical energy as methane from excess sludge waste unfortunately humic acids ha contained in excess sludge can have the effects of inhibiting the efficiency of energy conversion based on a batch experiment the impact of ha on a semi continuous ad process was sequentially investigated with the impact on the associated enzymes and microorganisms being measured the results of this semi continuous experiment indicate that the inhibition of the microbial community increased with an increased ha vss ratio long term cultivation did not result in the adaption of methane production to the presence of ha moreover at ha vss 20 the strongest inhibition 74 3 on energy conversion efficiency was observed in the semi continuous experiment which was two fold higher than that recorded in the batch experiment this is attributed to serious and irreversible inhibition of both acidogenic and methanogenic microorganisms as well as the physical chemical reactions between ha and the associated enzymes which it was concluded were the dominant mechanisms of inhibition in the batch experiment graphical abstract image 1 keywords humic acids ha anaerobic digestion ad semi continuous experiment energy conversion efficiency inhibition anaerobic microorganisms 1 introduction recovery of chemical organic energy from wastewater and or excess sludge is seen as crucial for making developments towards carbon neutral operation of wastewater treatment plants wwtps production of increased amounts of methane ch4 via anaerobic digestion ad therefore receives considerable attention appels et al 2011 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 hao et al 2015 2017a although anaerobic digestion ad can convert excess sludge into biogas ch4 relatively easily the process is not very efficient due to the stable structure of bacterial cell walls the presence of refractory organics such as lignocellulose substances and humic substances hss and other such factors liu et al 2016 liu et al 2019 moreover hss contained in excess sludge account for some 6 20 of volatile suspended solids vss thurman 1985 imai et al 2002 mainly originating from food waste leaves toilet paper etc with further small amounts being produced from the decay of organic substances during the anaerobic process hao et al 2017b for this reason it has been suggested that hss are a major obstacle limiting the conversion of organic compounds into ch4 chen et al 2008 li et al 2014 azman et al 2017 in order to explicitly study the impact and mechanisms of hss on the ad process therefore anaerobic digestion experiments have been conducted with humic acids ha representing hss chen et al 2008 azman et al 2015 liu et al 2015 azman et al 2017 however the results from these studies were all based on batch experiments or with model substances or artificial wastewater different from these batch experiments a quantitative experiment with ha free sludge amended with ha was designed to observe the impact and mechanism of ha in a batch digestion experiment li et al 2019 the results showed that ha inhibited ad efficiency by up to 35 1 ha vss 15 the effects of ha were quite different for the three main processes that occur simultaneously in anaerobic digestion hydrolytic efficiency was reduced by 38 2 while acidogenic efficiency seemed to be increased by 101 5 and methanogenic efficiency decreased by 52 2 li et al 2019 the experiment also indicated a strong correlation between increasing ha content and decreasing methane production li et al 2019 however the question still remains could a long term acclimatization induce adaptation to the impact of ha and therefore lead to different results in continuous ad mode following the batch experimental study li et al 2019 a semi continuous experiment was initiated with the similar experimental approach under semi continuous operation the impact of ha on the associated enzymes and microorganisms was evaluated and the adaptation of the microbial community to the presence of ha was emphasized by comparing the results from the two experiments the difference in the impact of ha was able to be highlighted and the reason for the difference elucidated 2 materials and methods both hss and metal ions such as ca2 mg2 al3 fe3 etc exist in excess sludge from wwtps and this can make the quantitative study of hss effects on the ad process difficult due to possible interactions between hss and metal ions azman et al 2015 li et al 2019 for this reason a synthetic substrate with trace metals and few hss was used to culture clean excess sludge in an sbr reactor the sludge was collected and concentrated by a 0 15 mm filter it was sieved and then stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for use the characteristics of concentrated clean excess sludge are listed in table 1 the inoculum sludge for the semi continuous experiment was cultured in a 6 l fermenter biostat b plus german working volume 4 0 l headspace volume 2 0 l at srt 30 d which was fed with the above concentrated clean sludge for half a year in this way hss contained in the fermenter were fully washed out and the inoculum sludge was obtained in this study a commercial ha was used as a substitute for natural ha present in excess sludge from wastewater treatment plants a quantitative analysis of the results at the wavenumber from 4000 to 1250 cm 1 by ftir spectrometer identification software revealed that the similarity degree between the two types of ha was as high as 87 3 which indicates that the commercial ha used in this study could be used as a suitable replacement for ha in practical sludge li et al 2019 most of the analytical methods referred to the batch experiment li et al 2019 ts total solid vs volatile solids mlss mixed liquor suspended solids mlvss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids ph and orp were detected with use of standard methods apha 1998 the microorganisms that were detected in the semi continuous experiment included five strains of acidogenic microorganisms as well as two strains of methanogenic microorganisms corresponding gene sequences refer to our previous studies hao et al 2017a li et al 2019 the semi continuous experiment was also conducted in a 6 l fermenter biostat b plus german working volume 4 0 l headspace volume 2 0 l t 35 c at srt 30 d the experiment was based on a four day cyclic operation mode every four days 500 ml of the digesting sludge was discharged from the fermenter after which 500 ml of the concentrated clean sludge was added different dosages of ha were added to the concentrated clean sludge respectively at ha vss 0 p0 5 p1 10 p2 and 20 p3 then ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 by naoh 3 m and or hcl 3 m 3 results and discussion 3 1 inhibiting biogas methane biogas and or methane production collected in every four day cycle is shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1a the production of biogas fluctuated when sludge was discharged and replenished due to the delay of system adaptions after an unstable period of about 16 days biogas production had stabilized in every four day cycle which indicates a stable operation of the semi continuous digestion reactor it was judged that the experiment could be brought to a conclusion as the data was ready for analysis as seen in fig 1a the average levels of biogas methane production tended to decrease with increasing ha dosages ha vss 0 5 10 and 20 from 291 192 ha vss 0 down to 126 75 ml g vss ha vss 20 clearly the energy conversion efficiency was significantly inhibited by higher ha dosages the average ch4 content also declined slightly from 66 0 ha vss 0 down to 59 2 ha vss 20 different ha dosages resulted in daily changes in biogas production fig 1b without ha dosing ha vss 0 biogas production quickly declined from 175 6 ml g vss on day 1 down to 21 ml g vss on day 4 however the tests dosed with ha did demonstrate a range of changes in biogas production due to inhibition from ha the other three tests tended to show delayed production depending on the ha dosages an extreme test ha vss 20 for example had the lowest biogas production 17 9 ml g vss on day 1 then climbed to 67 3 ml g vss on day 3 and finally declined to 13 7 ml g vss on day 4 these results show that ha inhibited the energy conversion efficiency while simultaneously delaying the conversion rate the methane inhibition efficiency ch4 ha 0 ch4 ha ch4 ha 0 is shown in fig 1c in which the significant inhibition of ha on methane production is clearly evident increasing from 46 4 ha vss 5 to 74 3 ha vss 20 these results confirm that ha does indeed inhibit energy conversion efficiency in a semi continuous ad system 3 2 accumulating polysaccharide and protein concentrations of polysaccharide and protein on day 2 are illustrated in fig 2 from this it can clearly be seen that the higher the ha dosage the higher the accumulations of both polysaccharide and protein in the fermenter their concentrations were about 89 2 mg l polysaccharide 152 3 mg l protein at ha vss 20 which accumulated by 5 times and 60 times respectively compared to the test without ha dosing 18 0 2 6 mg l accumulations of both polysaccharide and protein indicate significant inhibition of the hydrolytic process in the batch experiment ha also inhibited organic hydrolytic efficiency 38 2 it is therefore evident that ha is indeed capable of inhibiting the hydrolysis of sludge not just in a batch experiment but also in a semi continuous experiment 3 3 promoting total volatile fatty acids tvfas the changes and concentrations of total volatile fatty acids tvfas in the fermenter the aqueous phase are illustrated in fig 3 and as shown in fig 3a the time it took to reach the peak values of tvfas maximum production increased with higher ha dosages from 8 5 h ha vss 0 to 28 0 h ha vss 20 which further reveals how ha inhibited the hydrolytic process see also fig 2 and thereby delayed the acidogenic process compared to the tests without ha dosing however the maximum concentrations of tvfas were from 382 5 mg l ha vss 5 to 541 6 mg l ha vss 20 an increase of 19 69 calculated respectively fig 3b the hydrolytic and methanogenic processes seemed to be especially inhibited by ha whereas the acidogenic process did not seem to be impacted at all 3 4 lowering enzyme activity the activities of key enzymes were measured with the results being shown in fig 4 as can be seen in fig 4a the activities of both α amylase and proteinase the hydrolytic enzymes gradually declined with increasing ha dosages inhibition efficiency was at 45 for α amylase and 64 for proteinase at the ha vss dosage ratio of 20 this clearly reduced the overall hydrolytic rate and thus resulted in accumulations of polysaccharide and protein as shown in fig 2 similarly the activity of the f420 enzyme methanogenic enzymes also declined by 21 ha vss 5 to 68 ha vss 20 fig 4b which caused a loss in methane conversion efficiency fig 1 this decline can be attributed to the influence of electrostatic forces covalent bonding and sweep flocculation between ha and the associated enzymes as was illustrated in the previous batch experiment liu et al 2015 li et al 2019 in contrast to the decreased activities of hydrolytic and methanogenic enzymes the activity of acidogenic enzymes was enhanced by increased ha dosages see fig 5 the activities of pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase enzyme por acetate kinase ak phosphotransacetylase pta butyrate kinase bk and phosphotransbutyrylase ptb were enhanced respectively by 75 118 462 107 and 230 at ha vss 20 compared to ha vss 0 as described above ha lowered the activity of the hydrolytic enzymes however the activity of the acidogenic enzymes was enhanced which resulted in the promotion of the acidogenic process fig 3b it appears that ha might have an indirect effect on the acidogenic bacteria which could offset the potential inhibition of ha on the acidogenic enzymes according to other studies thauer et al 1977 cervantes et al 2000 azman et al 2015 li et al 2019 ha might be able to act as a terminal electron acceptor to accept the surplus electrons from long chain fatty acids when they are oxidized to acetate this could reduce the thermodynamic unfavourable production of hydrogen gas h2 and make the fermentative processes independent of partial hydrogen pressure as a result acidogenic bioconversions with ha dosing could be increased which would therefore result in an increase of the maximum tvfas production fig 3 3 5 decreasing abundance of microorganisms the abundance of microorganisms based on the fish method in the acidogenic process and the methanogenic process is illustrated in fig 6 the abundance of five strains of associated acidogenic microorganisms all declined gradually with ha dosing fig 6a the same trend was observed for two types of associated methanogenic microorganisms fig 6b thus it can be concluded that ha inhibition resulted in decreased abundance of associated microorganisms in the acidogenic process some acidogenic microorganisms such as fermenting bacteria lack an electron transport system resulting in their not being able to accomplish a complete electron transfer and material metabolism process smith et al 2015 li et al 2015 as described in section 3 4 long term acclimatization by ha altered the normal acidogenic bioactions under these circumstances other microorganisms such as humic acid reducing bacteria became the dominant bacteria in the acidogenic process lovley et al 1996 dang et al 2016 smith et al 2015 azman 2016 as a result the abundance of the acidogenic microorganisms decreased as shown in fig 6a with the ha reducing bacteria involved in the methanogenic process ha was able to directly oxidize acetate to co2 rather than to ch4 an effect that can also be inferred from the decline in the average methane content in biogas as shown in fig 1 cervantes et al 2000 liu et al 2015 khadem et al 2017 thus there was an insufficient substrate for the methanogenic microorganisms which caused their failure in competition with the humic acid reducing bacteria lovley et al 1996 after the long term acclimatization with ha dosing the abundance of the aceticlastic methanogenic microorganisms decreased as is shown in fig 6b on the other hand most of the autotrophic methanogenic bacteria in the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic process are gram negative which means that they have thinner cell walls and fewer peptidoglycan and polysaccharide components on their surface albers and meyer 2011 thus it becomes easier for ha to pass through the outer cell membrane cross the phospholipid bilayer reach the plasma membrane and eventually to enter into the cell interior minderlein and blodau 2010 albers and meyer 2011 finally ha destabilizes the bacteria cell after which the ability of ha to function as electron acceptors would completely destroy the cellular metabolic process and cause cell deactivation dang et al 2016 khadem et al 2017 moreover as described in the previous batch tests li et al 2019 ha acts as terminal electron acceptor to oxidize long chain fatty acids without producing hydrogen h2 which would also result in the abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis being decreased as shown in fig 6b 4 comparison between the batch and semi continuous experiments as concluded in the previous batch experiment azman et al 2015 liu et al 2015 li et al 2019 and as discussed above ha involvement in both the batch and semi continuous experiments inhibited energy conversion efficiency in anaerobic sludge digestion to an extent it also created the difference in the inhibition of the various processes in anaerobic sludge digestion the effects of the presence of ha on the same parameters in the short term batch tests versus the long term semi continuous tests is illustrated in fig 7 the larger the affected circle the stronger the effects of ha were clearly ha had the greater impact on the semi continuous ad process when compared to the batch experiment in both the batch and semi continuous experiments ha was able to lower the activities of hydrolytic enzymes and methanogenic enzymes through the functions of electrostatic force covalent bond and sweep flocculation resulting in accumulations of polysaccharide and protein liu et al 2015 li et al 2019 at the same time ha could have acted as terminal electron acceptors accepting surplus electrons from long chains fatty acids oxidation to acetate an effect which has been shown to stimulate the activity of the acidogenic enzymes indirectly and to promote the acidogenic process thauer et al 1977 cervantes et al 2000 azman et al 2015 li et al 2019 however ha tended to inhibit the semi continuous ad system to a greater extent than in the batch system with similar ha dosages a two fold higher methanogenic inhibition percentage was observed 35 batch vs 74 semi continuous in the batch tests it is likely that ha inhibited the ad process due to the physical chemical actions between ha and the associated enzymes during the long acclimatization period srt 30 days there was clearly no improvement and adaptation did not occur indeed the impact of ha on sludge digestion was greater in the semi continuous operation this suggests that apart from the direct impact on the bioconversion processes there was also an impact on the growth processes of the concerned populations which caused a serious decline in the abundance of both the acidogenic and methanogenic microorganisms it seems that the inhibition caused by ha was irreversible and that adaptation of the original microorganisms did not occur after long term acclimatization to ha dosing for this reason the functional bacteria were unable to compete with other microorganisms moreover although ha was able to promote the acidification process the unenhanced energy conversion efficiency was attributed to the ha reducing bacteria growing and becoming the dominant bacteria in the ad system it can also be concluded that although a small dosage of ha ha vss 5 did not have a noticeable effect on methane production a larger dosage of ha ha vss 20 is definitely able to inhibit the ad system the highest inhibited energy conversion efficiency in the batch tests was lower than 35 2 but it climbed to 74 3 in the semi continuous tests based on both batch and semi continuous experiments the negative impact of hss on the ad process was confirmed preferentially hss should either be separated from excess sludge or mitigated by some measures although separating hss from excess sludge is feasible in technology it is at present such a complicated time consuming and expensive process ihss 2016 that in practical terms separation of hss cannot be recommended for the purpose of anaerobic digestion instead a new experiment was initiated to mitigate the inhibition of hss by dosing digested sludge with metal cations the highest mitigated efficiency 65 was observed at dosing levels of either ca2 100 mg l or al3 70 mg l respectively mixed dosage of metal cations was able to produce even higher levels of mitigated efficiency to be reaching 80 at dosing ca2 50 mg l plus al3 10 mg l simultaneously hao et al 2018 the experiment also implies that wastewater from regions with hard drinking water containing a high content of calcium ca2 might be able to attain an even better anaerobic digestion process 5 conclusions it is clear that the presence of humic acids ha in excess sludge inhibited the energy conversion efficiency of anaerobic digestion ad compared to the batch experiment the semi continuous experiment did not result in any improvements indicating that adaptation of the microbial community did not occur the higher the amount of added humic acids was the stronger the inhibition of the bioconversion when humic acids amounted to 20 of the incoming vss the process rate was decreased in the semi continuous experiment by 75 which is two fold higher than that recorded in the batch experiment declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements the study was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china 51578036

18698,anaerobic digestion ad is a technology for recovering chemical energy as methane from excess sludge waste unfortunately humic acids ha contained in excess sludge can have the effects of inhibiting the efficiency of energy conversion based on a batch experiment the impact of ha on a semi continuous ad process was sequentially investigated with the impact on the associated enzymes and microorganisms being measured the results of this semi continuous experiment indicate that the inhibition of the microbial community increased with an increased ha vss ratio long term cultivation did not result in the adaption of methane production to the presence of ha moreover at ha vss 20 the strongest inhibition 74 3 on energy conversion efficiency was observed in the semi continuous experiment which was two fold higher than that recorded in the batch experiment this is attributed to serious and irreversible inhibition of both acidogenic and methanogenic microorganisms as well as the physical chemical reactions between ha and the associated enzymes which it was concluded were the dominant mechanisms of inhibition in the batch experiment graphical abstract image 1 keywords humic acids ha anaerobic digestion ad semi continuous experiment energy conversion efficiency inhibition anaerobic microorganisms 1 introduction recovery of chemical organic energy from wastewater and or excess sludge is seen as crucial for making developments towards carbon neutral operation of wastewater treatment plants wwtps production of increased amounts of methane ch4 via anaerobic digestion ad therefore receives considerable attention appels et al 2011 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 hao et al 2015 2017a although anaerobic digestion ad can convert excess sludge into biogas ch4 relatively easily the process is not very efficient due to the stable structure of bacterial cell walls the presence of refractory organics such as lignocellulose substances and humic substances hss and other such factors liu et al 2016 liu et al 2019 moreover hss contained in excess sludge account for some 6 20 of volatile suspended solids vss thurman 1985 imai et al 2002 mainly originating from food waste leaves toilet paper etc with further small amounts being produced from the decay of organic substances during the anaerobic process hao et al 2017b for this reason it has been suggested that hss are a major obstacle limiting the conversion of organic compounds into ch4 chen et al 2008 li et al 2014 azman et al 2017 in order to explicitly study the impact and mechanisms of hss on the ad process therefore anaerobic digestion experiments have been conducted with humic acids ha representing hss chen et al 2008 azman et al 2015 liu et al 2015 azman et al 2017 however the results from these studies were all based on batch experiments or with model substances or artificial wastewater different from these batch experiments a quantitative experiment with ha free sludge amended with ha was designed to observe the impact and mechanism of ha in a batch digestion experiment li et al 2019 the results showed that ha inhibited ad efficiency by up to 35 1 ha vss 15 the effects of ha were quite different for the three main processes that occur simultaneously in anaerobic digestion hydrolytic efficiency was reduced by 38 2 while acidogenic efficiency seemed to be increased by 101 5 and methanogenic efficiency decreased by 52 2 li et al 2019 the experiment also indicated a strong correlation between increasing ha content and decreasing methane production li et al 2019 however the question still remains could a long term acclimatization induce adaptation to the impact of ha and therefore lead to different results in continuous ad mode following the batch experimental study li et al 2019 a semi continuous experiment was initiated with the similar experimental approach under semi continuous operation the impact of ha on the associated enzymes and microorganisms was evaluated and the adaptation of the microbial community to the presence of ha was emphasized by comparing the results from the two experiments the difference in the impact of ha was able to be highlighted and the reason for the difference elucidated 2 materials and methods both hss and metal ions such as ca2 mg2 al3 fe3 etc exist in excess sludge from wwtps and this can make the quantitative study of hss effects on the ad process difficult due to possible interactions between hss and metal ions azman et al 2015 li et al 2019 for this reason a synthetic substrate with trace metals and few hss was used to culture clean excess sludge in an sbr reactor the sludge was collected and concentrated by a 0 15 mm filter it was sieved and then stored in a refrigerator at 4 c for use the characteristics of concentrated clean excess sludge are listed in table 1 the inoculum sludge for the semi continuous experiment was cultured in a 6 l fermenter biostat b plus german working volume 4 0 l headspace volume 2 0 l at srt 30 d which was fed with the above concentrated clean sludge for half a year in this way hss contained in the fermenter were fully washed out and the inoculum sludge was obtained in this study a commercial ha was used as a substitute for natural ha present in excess sludge from wastewater treatment plants a quantitative analysis of the results at the wavenumber from 4000 to 1250 cm 1 by ftir spectrometer identification software revealed that the similarity degree between the two types of ha was as high as 87 3 which indicates that the commercial ha used in this study could be used as a suitable replacement for ha in practical sludge li et al 2019 most of the analytical methods referred to the batch experiment li et al 2019 ts total solid vs volatile solids mlss mixed liquor suspended solids mlvss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids ph and orp were detected with use of standard methods apha 1998 the microorganisms that were detected in the semi continuous experiment included five strains of acidogenic microorganisms as well as two strains of methanogenic microorganisms corresponding gene sequences refer to our previous studies hao et al 2017a li et al 2019 the semi continuous experiment was also conducted in a 6 l fermenter biostat b plus german working volume 4 0 l headspace volume 2 0 l t 35 c at srt 30 d the experiment was based on a four day cyclic operation mode every four days 500 ml of the digesting sludge was discharged from the fermenter after which 500 ml of the concentrated clean sludge was added different dosages of ha were added to the concentrated clean sludge respectively at ha vss 0 p0 5 p1 10 p2 and 20 p3 then ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 by naoh 3 m and or hcl 3 m 3 results and discussion 3 1 inhibiting biogas methane biogas and or methane production collected in every four day cycle is shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1a the production of biogas fluctuated when sludge was discharged and replenished due to the delay of system adaptions after an unstable period of about 16 days biogas production had stabilized in every four day cycle which indicates a stable operation of the semi continuous digestion reactor it was judged that the experiment could be brought to a conclusion as the data was ready for analysis as seen in fig 1a the average levels of biogas methane production tended to decrease with increasing ha dosages ha vss 0 5 10 and 20 from 291 192 ha vss 0 down to 126 75 ml g vss ha vss 20 clearly the energy conversion efficiency was significantly inhibited by higher ha dosages the average ch4 content also declined slightly from 66 0 ha vss 0 down to 59 2 ha vss 20 different ha dosages resulted in daily changes in biogas production fig 1b without ha dosing ha vss 0 biogas production quickly declined from 175 6 ml g vss on day 1 down to 21 ml g vss on day 4 however the tests dosed with ha did demonstrate a range of changes in biogas production due to inhibition from ha the other three tests tended to show delayed production depending on the ha dosages an extreme test ha vss 20 for example had the lowest biogas production 17 9 ml g vss on day 1 then climbed to 67 3 ml g vss on day 3 and finally declined to 13 7 ml g vss on day 4 these results show that ha inhibited the energy conversion efficiency while simultaneously delaying the conversion rate the methane inhibition efficiency ch4 ha 0 ch4 ha ch4 ha 0 is shown in fig 1c in which the significant inhibition of ha on methane production is clearly evident increasing from 46 4 ha vss 5 to 74 3 ha vss 20 these results confirm that ha does indeed inhibit energy conversion efficiency in a semi continuous ad system 3 2 accumulating polysaccharide and protein concentrations of polysaccharide and protein on day 2 are illustrated in fig 2 from this it can clearly be seen that the higher the ha dosage the higher the accumulations of both polysaccharide and protein in the fermenter their concentrations were about 89 2 mg l polysaccharide 152 3 mg l protein at ha vss 20 which accumulated by 5 times and 60 times respectively compared to the test without ha dosing 18 0 2 6 mg l accumulations of both polysaccharide and protein indicate significant inhibition of the hydrolytic process in the batch experiment ha also inhibited organic hydrolytic efficiency 38 2 it is therefore evident that ha is indeed capable of inhibiting the hydrolysis of sludge not just in a batch experiment but also in a semi continuous experiment 3 3 promoting total volatile fatty acids tvfas the changes and concentrations of total volatile fatty acids tvfas in the fermenter the aqueous phase are illustrated in fig 3 and as shown in fig 3a the time it took to reach the peak values of tvfas maximum production increased with higher ha dosages from 8 5 h ha vss 0 to 28 0 h ha vss 20 which further reveals how ha inhibited the hydrolytic process see also fig 2 and thereby delayed the acidogenic process compared to the tests without ha dosing however the maximum concentrations of tvfas were from 382 5 mg l ha vss 5 to 541 6 mg l ha vss 20 an increase of 19 69 calculated respectively fig 3b the hydrolytic and methanogenic processes seemed to be especially inhibited by ha whereas the acidogenic process did not seem to be impacted at all 3 4 lowering enzyme activity the activities of key enzymes were measured with the results being shown in fig 4 as can be seen in fig 4a the activities of both α amylase and proteinase the hydrolytic enzymes gradually declined with increasing ha dosages inhibition efficiency was at

fig 2 similarly the activity of the f420 enzyme methanogenic enzymes also declined by 21 ha vss 5 to 68 ha vss 20 fig 4b which caused a loss in methane conversion efficiency fig 1 this decline can be attributed to the influence of electrostatic forces covalent bonding and sweep flocculation between ha and the associated enzymes as was illustrated in the previous batch experiment liu et al 2015 li et al 2019 in contrast to the decreased activities of hydrolytic and methanogenic enzymes the activity of acidogenic enzymes was enhanced by increased ha dosages see fig 5 the activities of pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase enzyme por acetate kinase ak phosphotransacetylase pta butyrate kinase bk and phosphotransbutyrylase ptb were enhanced respectively by 75 118 462 107 and 230 at ha vss 20 compared to ha vss 0 as described above ha lowered the activity of the hydrolytic enzymes however the activity of the acidogenic enzymes was enhanced which resulted in the promotion of the acidogenic process fig 3b it appears that ha might have an indirect effect on the acidogenic bacteria which could offset the potential inhibition of ha on the acidogenic enzymes according to other studies thauer

oxidized to acetate this could reduce the thermodynamic unfavourable production of hydrogen gas h2 and make the fermentative processes independent of partial hydrogen pressure as a result acidogenic bioconversions with ha dosing could be increased which would therefore result in an increase of the maximum tvfas production fig 3 3 5 decreasing abundance of microorganisms the abundance of microorganisms based on the fish method in the acidogenic process and the methanogenic process is illustrated in fig 6 the abundance of five strains of associated acidogenic microorganisms all declined gradually with ha dosing fig 6a the same trend was observed for two types of associated methanogenic microorganisms fig 6b thus it can be concluded that ha inhibition resulted in decreased abundance of associated microorganisms in the acidogenic process some acidogenic microorganisms such as fermenting bacteria lack an electron transport system resulting in their not being able to

18699,our objective was to determine whether β lactamase genes are carried within bacteriophage capsids as a first step towards exploring the possible role of bacteriophages as vehicles for dispersal of antimicrobial resistance genes through an agricultural region of washington state water samples n 178 from municipal wastewater treatment plants river and irrigation canals were collected over a

bacterial and phage fractions of water samples was evaluated by pcr all of the seven targeted resistance genes were detected both in wastewater and river water samples relatively high proportions of samples 7 3 64 9 positive for resistance genes were found in bacteriophage fractions of water samples compared to the bacterial fractions 5 4 36 8 bla oxa 48 like 57 3 and bla tem 64 0 were the most prevalent antimicrobial resistance genes detected at all the sampling points resistance genes are commonly present in treated wastewater flowing through municipal and agricultural environments

infections with associated bla ctx m genes castanheira et al 2008 ctx m ec in cattle were first detected by wittum and others in ohio in 2009 wittum et al 2010 data from washington state indicates that the current widespread prevalence of ctx m ec among washington state dairy farms developed after 2007 and before 2011 davis et al 2015 presumably the establishment of bla ctx m positive gram negative pathogens in human populations kim et al 2007 qin et al 2008 preceded the emergence of ctx m ec in dairy cattle this apparent temporal relationship between human and livestock occurrence of bla ctx m prompted the hypothesis that waterborne phages bearing bla ctx m could play a role in transfer of a novel resistance gene to a naïve population one mechanism that could explain resistance gene sharing between human and livestock populations may be transduction the resistance of phage particles to environmental stresses including wastewater treatments could allow phage particles to flow from human waste to waterways that irrigate feed crops or influence drinking water sources for livestock this route could explain a rapid dissemination of bla ctx m genes throughout dairy farms in our region if they were phage associated and if transduction occurred high copy numbers of bacterial resistance genes have been detected in viral fractions of municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents in europe and tunisia colomer lluch et al 2014 but there is very little data on phage associated resistance genes in wastewater and other surface waters in the united states as a preliminary

the primary clarifiers where heavy solids settle to the bottom this is followed by biological treatment in an aeration tank where it is mixed with activated sludge containing returned sludge and a mix of microorganisms after this biological treatment wastewater flows through secondary clarifiers is sent through tubes exposed to ultraviolet radiation then discharged to the yakima river both are permitted to discharge effluent to surface water under the national pollutant discharge elimination system of the environmental protection agency npeds 2 3 samples all water samples were collected in sterile buckets volumes for filtration were measured on site with sterile nalgene beakers 2 3 1 wwtp samples each wwtp was visited ten times at approximately biweekly intervals between january 2016 and july 2016 and at each visit samples were collected from the raw influent primary clarifier and effluent for a total of 63 wastewater samples table s1 2 3 2 river and canal samples irrigation season begins in march and canals were visited at weekly to biweekly intervals between march 2016 and august 2016 the roza canal was visited at various sites 16 times and the sunnyside canal 15 times each visit included collection of 1 4 samples for a total of 40 samples each the yakima river was sampled 21 times at approximately one to two week intervals for a total of 42 samples table s1 sampling sites along the river were chosen for convenience and safety of access and in order to represent the range of the river that extended between the city of yakima and benton city with the permission of the sunnyside valley irrigation district we were allowed access to their sampling sites along both irrigation canals approximate locations of river and canal sampling are shown in fig s1 2 4 sample preparation at each sampling site 1 l of sewage sample or 2 l of river canal water were passed through 0 5 mm and 0 25 mm nylon filters the strainrite company auburn maine usa after that filtration samples were transported at ambient temperatures to a laboratory facility located at the washington state university irrigated agriculture research and extension center in prosser washington where they were held for less than 2 h before processing samples were filtered and concentrated by a tangential flow filtration tff system ge healthcare life sciences pittsburgh pa usa to 40 50 ml per sample following the manufacturer s instructions tff systems separate smaller sized particles by pushing the water across the filter surface rather than perpendicular to it and recycling the water sample many times through the system wommack et al 2009 this process took 20 min to 1 h for each sample to ensure that there was no cross contamination between samples 20 naoh 4 l was circulated through the tff system for at least 20 min followed by miniq water at least 10 l until the ph of the water was 7 0 between each sample a sample 10 ml was collected from the effluent of the tff system at the end of each washing as a control sample each control sample underwent the dna extraction process and pcr testing for 16s rdna and resistance genes only one such sample was positive for 16s rdna and so the associated experimental sample was not used in the analysis wastewater influent and clarifier samples were centrifuged at 600 g for 15 min to remove additional debris prior to filtration final filtration was completed using 0 45 low protein binding 0 45 μm followed by 0 22 μm pore size membrane filtration sterivex gm millipore bedford ma the 0 45 μl filters included bacteria and were sealed using parafilm sigma saint louis mi usa both the viral fractions passthrough from the 0 22 μm membranes and the bacterial fractions were transported on ice to the laboratory in pullman washington where they were stored at 4 c and underwent dna extraction as described below 2 5 purification of phage dna purification of phage particle dna was performed as previously described colomer lluch et al 2011 with a few modifications the total volume of the viral fraction was reduced to 0 5 ml by using protein concentrators 100 kda amicon ultra centrifugal filter units millipore bedford ma following the manufacturer s instructions the viral concentrate was adjusted to 2 ml with dna free pcr water thermofisher samples were incubated with dnase 100 units ml of the viral concentrate at 37 c for 1 h to eliminate free dna outside the phage particles the samples were heated to 65 c for 5 min and treated with 0 5m edta to stop the dnase reaction viral capsids were subsequently lysed using proteinase k 20 mg ml invitrogen carlsbad ca and 10 sds at 56 c for 1 h phenol chloroform 1 1 v v was added and the phenol chloroform phage lysate mixture 4 ml was added to phase lock gel tubes 5 prime fisher scientific company usa centrifuged and the dna was ethanol precipitated following the manufacturer s instructions dna was eluted in a final volume of 50 μl and evaluated by agarose 0 8 gel electrophoresis ethidium bromide stained dna was illuminated under uv and the region with a visible dna smear was cut from the gels and purified genejet gel extraction kit thermofisher the concentration and purity of the dna extracted from the phage fraction was estimated by using a nanodrop nd 2000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies thermoscientifics wilmington usa after dnase treatment but before disencapsidation an aliquot of the sample was evaluated by pcr for the presence of bacterial 16s rdna to rule out the presence of bacterial dna table s2 this control was to ensure that the dnase treatment had removed all non encapsidated dna from the samples other than that contained in intact virions those samples that were positive for 16s rdna at this stage n 8 were excluded from the analysis 2 6 bacterial fractions sealed 0 45 μm pore filters from the phage purification procedure described above were refrigerated overnight 4 c to remove bacteria from the filter 1 x phosphate buffered saline pbs 3 ml was added to the filter and placed in a hybridization oven for 30 min at 37oc the bacterial fraction was dislodged from the filter by back washing with a syringe the resulting bacterial suspensions were then placed in a 10 ml tube and centrifuged at 600 g for 5 min to remove the larger pieces of debris these were transferred to a 1 5 ml tube and again pelleted at 10 000 g for 10 min the resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 x pbs 200 μl and the dna was extracted using qiagen dneasy kit valencia ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions concentration and purity were assessed by using a nanodrop dn 2000 spectrophotometer 2 7 pcr amplification of esbl and carbapenemase genes pcr based screening of the most commonly found esbl gene families bla tem bla ctx m groups bla pse and bla cmy 2 and clinically important carbapenemase gene families bla kpc bla oxa 48 and bla ndm 1 were performed using previously published primers and cycling conditions table s2 bacterial strains used as positive control strains for pcr are listed in table s3 2 8 data analysis chi square tests to compare proportions cochrain armitage tests for trend and 95 confidence intervals surrounding proportions were calculated using winpepi software abramson 2011 3 results 3 1 numbers of samples bacterial dna was available for testing from all 185 samples but phage fraction dna was available for 170 samples after excluding 8 samples in which 16s rdna was detected post filtration and or after disencapsidation an additional 7 samples were inadvertently discarded 3 2 prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes args bla tem was detected in 64 0 of the bacteriophage fractions of all samples followed by bla oxa 48 57 3 bla pse 52 8 bla ctx m 52 2 bla kpc 42 7 bla cmy 2 38 8 and bla ndm 1 7 3 in the bacterial dna fractions of all samples bla oxa 48 was detected most frequently 36 8 followed by bla tem 34 6 bla ctx m and bla pse each 32 4 bla cmy 2 30 8 bla kpc 25 4 and bla ndm 1 5 4 resistance genes were detected more frequently in samples from the wastewater treatment plants than in river and canal water samples the prevalence of each gene was statistically significantly higher in wastewater samples than in river and canal samples combined the p values for the mantel henszel chi square tests for each of the seven genes were all lower than 000000013 after the benjamini hochberg method of adjusting for multiple comparisons table s4 the phage fractions of river and canal samples were more likely to be positive for all of the genes tested except for bla ndm 1 than were the bacterial fractions of those river and canal samples table s5 whereas the proportion of sample fractions that were positive for bla cmy 2 bla ndm 1 bla ctx m bla pse and bla pse did not different significantly between phage and bacterial fractions from wastewater samples in wastewater bla kpc and bla oxa 48 were more likely to be detected in phage fractions than in the bacterial fractions of samples table s5 see table 1 within the wastewater treatment plants the prevalence of resistance genes in samples from effluent were generally lower than those from influent or primary clarifier but these differences were not statistically significant one exception was that bla ctx m was significantly less likely to be detected in bacterial fractions of effluent samples 9 22 than in bacterial fractions of influent 19 20 and the primary clarifier 20 21 samples fisher s exact chi square p 0 001 table 2 4 discussion the goal of this study was to determine whether bacteriophages in water could be vehicles for dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes across a region of central washington state we detected bla ctx m genes in both bacteriophage and bacterial fractions of a high proportion of samples but we did not establish their functionality which could be affected by uv radiation during the disinfection process of wastewater treatment chang et al 2017 mckinney and pruden 2012 in addition to bla ctx m we detected high proportions of medically important carbapenemase genes bla kpc bla oxa 48 like and bla ndm 1 in phage fractions of environmental water to our knowledge this is the first published report of finding carbapenemase genes in bacteriophage dna fractions of wastewater effluents river and irrigation canals in the united states although widespread presence of carbapenem resistant e coli in wastewater in the united states have been reported shaikh et al 2015 and previous studies in the u s and canada have reported finding non carbapenem args in the phage fractions of environmental waters chaves barquero et al 2016 pruden et al 2012 the role of phage in resistance gene transmission over distances remains speculative however our finding that phage fractions of river and canal samples are more likely to be associated with resistance genes than bacterial fractions gives credence to that possibility the global impacts of wastewater effluents on receiving waters usually rivers have been well documented these impacts include human pathogenic viruses pang et al 2019 antibiotic resistance genes and pathogenic bacteria brown et al 2019 multi resistant gram negative bacteria muller et al 2018 and many others devarajan et al 2015 khan et al 2018 lood et al 2017 muller et al 2018 the yakima river receives effluents from at least thirteen wwtps between its source and its mouth at the columbia river ely et al 2011 the high frequency of carbapenemase gene positive river samples in this study supports the possibility of wastewater as a source bla oxa 48 was ubiquitous in every type of sample but particularly in wastewater samples where the prevalence in bacteriophage and bacterial fractions was 93 3 and 82 5 respectively within the wwtps 100 of phage fractions of wastewater influent and primary clarifier samples were positive for bla oxa 48 internationally bla oxa 48 like genes have been reported in clinical enterobacteriaceae at a relatively low prevalence zowawi et al 2014 and were reported for the first time in the united states in 2012 from travel related patients mathers et al 2013 the washington state department of health surveillance data of healthcare associated infections does not suggest a higher frequency of infections with bla oxa 48 like genes than other carbapenemase genes but these data only represent reported health care associated infections and community carriage rates may be higher washington state department of health 2016 this study provides evidence that phage particles can harbor args and suggests that bacteriophage transduction could possibly play a role in horizontal transfer of resistance genes this possibility has been supported by some experimental results for example battoglioli et al isolated phages from wastewater that were capable of transducing args via generalized transduction from one bacterial host to another supporting the biological plausibility of this concept battaglioli et al 2011 to explain transfer of the bla ctx m genes between human and cattle our finding of genes within bacteriophages in water is only a preliminary step further work is needed to determine whether transduction occurs and whether river and canal water impact cattle populations opinions as to the importance of phage transduction differ two recent studies that used metagenomics to characterize resistance genes in viral fractions generated conflicting findings enault et al provided compelling evidence that human associated viromes rarely carry args enault et al 2017 while another study of six pig associated viromes determined that phages from non human sources harbor a high abundance of args subirats et al 2016 wastewater treatment plants may provide environments where concentrations of bacteria and bacteriophages are high enough to increase the frequency of bacteria bacteriophage encounters that are required for infection and subsequent transduction to occur muniesa et al 2013 although we did not measure concentrations we detected significantly higher prevalence of resistance genes in the total bacterial fraction of wastewater samples than that in the river and canal samples and some resistance genes bla ctx m bla tem and bla cmy 2 were more prevalent in the phage fractions of primary clarifier samples than in the influent 5 conclusion we found carbapenemase and other β lactamase genes in both phage and bacterial fractions but most of the genes were found more frequently in the phage fractions of river and canal samples than in the bacterial fractions of those samples finding carbapenemase genes such as bla ndm 1 in environmental water is very concerning and the potential for bacteriophage mediated transmission of args should be further explored imamovic et al 2010 to our knowledge this is the first published report of bla ndm 1 in environmental waters of the united

18699,our objective was to determine whether β lactamase genes are carried within bacteriophage capsids as a first step towards exploring the possible role of bacteriophages as vehicles for dispersal of antimicrobial resistance genes through an agricultural region of washington state water samples n 178 from municipal wastewater treatment plants river and irrigation canals were collected over a period of eight months the occurrence of four β lactam resistance gene groups bla tem bla ctx m bla pse and bla cmy 2 and three carbapenem resistance genes bla kpc bla oxa 48 like and bla ndm in bacterial and phage fractions of water samples was evaluated by pcr all of the seven targeted resistance genes were detected both in wastewater and river water samples relatively high proportions of samples 7 3 64 9 positive for resistance genes were found in bacteriophage fractions of water samples compared to the bacterial fractions 5 4 36 8 bla oxa 48 like 57 3 and bla tem 64 0 were the most prevalent antimicrobial resistance genes detected at all the sampling points resistance genes are commonly present in treated wastewater flowing through municipal and agricultural environments indicating a plausible role for this water in the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance traits including bla ctx m keywords antimicrobial resistance bacteriophage wastewater β lactamases bla ctx m

multiple scales within hospitals where local increases in their prevalence were most likely driven by a combination of antibiotic use and bacterial transmission chen et al 2014 lohr et al 2013 at the community level kassakian and mermel 2014 qi et al 2010 and at the regional penades et al 2015 and global levels bevan et al 2017 ctx m enzymes confer resistance to an array of β lactam drugs and they are often associated with co resistances resulting in severely reduced therapeutic options hayakawa et al 2013 in north america bla ctx m bearing e coli ctx m ec were reported in 2000 in canada mulvey et al 2004 and in the united states between 2001 and 2002 moland et al 2003 by 2007 in the united states 80 of 15 geographically dispersed medical centers reported e coli or klebsiella pneumoniae infections with associated bla ctx m genes castanheira et al 2008 ctx m ec in cattle were first detected by wittum and others in ohio in 2009 wittum et al 2010 data from washington state indicates that the current widespread prevalence of ctx m ec among washington state dairy farms developed after 2007 and before 2011 davis et al 2015 presumably the establishment of bla ctx m positive gram negative pathogens in human populations kim et al 2007 qin et al 2008 preceded the emergence of ctx m ec in dairy cattle this apparent temporal relationship between human and livestock occurrence of bla ctx m prompted the hypothesis that waterborne phages bearing bla ctx m could play a role in transfer of a novel resistance gene to a naïve population one mechanism that could explain resistance gene sharing between human and livestock populations may be transduction the resistance of phage particles to environmental stresses including wastewater treatments could allow phage particles to flow from human waste to waterways that irrigate feed crops or influence drinking water sources for livestock this route could explain a rapid dissemination of bla ctx m genes throughout dairy farms in our region if they were phage associated and if transduction occurred high copy numbers of bacterial resistance genes have been detected in viral fractions of municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents in europe and tunisia colomer lluch et al 2014 but there is very little data on phage associated resistance genes in wastewater and other surface waters in the united states as a preliminary step towards exploring whether bacteriophages may possibly have played a role in resistance gene dispersal specifically bla ctx m we tested whether β lactamase genes are carried within bacteriophage
