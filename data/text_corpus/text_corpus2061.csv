10305,identifying the dominance of climate and land use in soil water balance swb is critical for developing water resource management strategies in agriculture and in environment the large soil water reservoir in the thick vadose zone of china s loess plateau has been depleting in recent years however the connection of climate and land use changes with swb has rarely been differentiated an experimental site from china s loess plateau with different land uses including farmland and apple trees of different ages approximately 20 and 30 years old were considered to partition the swb components under the current 1957 2017 and future 2011 2040 climate using the hydrus 1d model simulated with three land use types and 20 climate change scenarios 60 swb scenarios were used to differentiate the role of climate and land use in swb changes for the climate change impacts precipitation played an important role in swb variability than temperature further the variance of precipitation had greater effects than mean precipitation on swb components the changes in the actual evapotranspiration were dominated by precipitation and temperature but the change in groundwater recharge was largely controlled by the conversion from farmland to apple trees this study provides information to guide the implementation of the revegetation program on the loess plateau and highlights the importance in differentiating the influences of climate and land use changes to sustain agriculture and water resources in the future keywords evapotranspiration groundwater recharge wavelet analysis loess plateau hydrus 1d model 1 introduction soil water is an important water resource connecting the atmosphere hydrosphere lithosphere and biosphere legates et al 2011 however it has been threatened by changes in climate and land use worldwide lu et al 2019 porporato et al 2004 sen 2009 seneviratne et al 2010 vorosmarty et al 2000 the climate change impacts on soil water balance swb mainly come from changes in spatial and temporal patterns of climatic variables such as rainfall and temperature dayon et al 2018 kim and stricker 1996 loaiciga et al 1996 while the land use change impacts on swb mainly comes from different characteristics of plants such as the root system and coverage li et al 2018 lin et al 2019 scott and biederman 2019 while researches have explored the connection of either climate or land use changes with swb it is critical to quantify the potential changes in swb within different land uses under changing climate the climate and land use changes affect swb at different time scales in general the intra and inter annual variability of climate affect swb both at intra annual and longer time scales dayon et al 2018 mahmood and jia 2019 whereas the seasonal variations and continuous growth of plants influence swb either rapidly or chronically liu et al 2019 this further complicates the identification of the dominance of climate and land use on swb in some cases climate change influenced swb less dramatically than land use change strasser et al 2019 warburton et al 2010 however the opposite also has been reported by others researchers zheng et al 2019 zipper et al 2018 thus differentiation of climate and land use change impacts on swb can help guide future strategies to manage land and water more sustainably the changes in the means and extremes of climate have different effects on water cycle for example the extreme climate events are of increasing concerns since they can lead to more disasters than single change in the mean values hirabayashi et al 2013 porporato et al 2004 similarly extreme precipitation events can influence flood and soil erosion differently with changes in frequency over intensity arnell and gosling 2016 li and jin 2017 zhang et al 2020 the increased variability in precipitation may increase groundwater recharge as intensive rainfalls may ultimately increase infiltration and recharge of water table holman 2005 liu et al 2010 focusing on the changes in mean climate the climate change effects on swb can be partially interpreted however a small change in mean values may be a result of large changes in extreme events galbraith et al 2010 isabelle et al 2020 shen et al 2020 therefore it is important to investigate the connection of mean and extreme climate with swb and further identify their dominance with this information the adaptation to climate change can be discussed for agriculture or water resources the regions sensitive and vulnerable to climate and land use changes should receive more attention loaiciga et al 1996 porporato et al 2004 sen 2009 seneviratne et al 2010 for example the loess plateau located in subhumid to arid regions of china has experienced significant climate and land use changes and subsequently impacted the hydrological system li et al 2010 a significant increase in temperature with insignificant change in precipitation has resulted in an imbalance in surface water budget by 20 6 chen et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 vegetation cover has increased from 31 6 in 1999 to 59 6 in 2013 of the total area as a result of the grain for green project s initiative to plant trees and improve grasslands huang et al 2019b wang et al 2015a the conversion from cropland to forestland has also reached 1 0 105 km2 in 2020 all these greatly decreased surface runoff and help achieve the sustainable water resource limits feng et al 2016 however it is not clear how these land use changes will impact the hydrology under potential changing climate scenario in this area and should be studied to make the ecosystem sustainable the soil water storage is huge in the loess plateau with loess up to 350 m deep zhu et al 2019 however the depletion of soil water and groundwater has been observed in many regions potentially induced by large scale transformation from shallow to deep rooted plants huang and pang 2010 wang et al 2010 without enough soil water the sustainability of the vegetation pattern has been doubted in recent years however the afforestation of both deciduous and evergreen species will continue since the government announced a target of 30 forest coverage by 2050 while the current forest cover is 22 ge et al 2019 under the background of changing climate more attention should be paid to quantify whether the climate and soil water reservoirs sustain the current and targeted land use pattern this study aimed at evaluating the climate and land use change effects on swb and further to differentiate their dominant role specifically we asked the following questions i how does climate change influence swb for different land use types ii between climate and land use changes which factor plays dominant role in swb changes iii what are the implications of changing climate and land use on the management of agriculture and water resources we answered these questions using information from field experiments and modeling work the information will be helpful for adaptive management of water and vegetation under the current and future climate in the study area and similar regions elsewhere 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was conducted at the changwu loess tableland fig 1 with typical rainfed agriculture and apple orchards that were converted from farmland the tableland has a flat surface with an elevation of 1220 m the long term 1957 2017 annual average precipitation is 585 0 mm the mean annual air temperature is 9 4 c and the mean annual potential evapotranspiration is 1015 4 mm the soil is a typical loessic soil with a silty clay loam texture according to the fao soil classification system fao unesco 1988 the water table in this region varied from 30 to 100 m below the soil surface wang et al 2010 the dominant land use types on the tableland are farmland and apple orchard but the apple orchards are converted from farmlands up to 30 years old as such the plateau has been identified as a susceptible area to changing climate and changes in land use such as afforestation has already increased vegetation cover decreased soil erosion and soil water storage huang and gallichand 2006 the study area is thus a good platform to analyze the connection of land use change with swb under changing climate 2 2 data collection to investigate the impacts of climate and land use changes on swb we required two datasets one for swb simulation and the other for climate change scenarios development we collected field data from the changwu agroecological experimental station on the loess plateau chinese academy of sciences fig 1 and used for swb simulation we used hydrus 1d model to simulate swb with inputs of various climate soil and vegetation depending on the regions under investigation šimůnek et al 2008 the climate data included both the observation and the downscaled earth system models esm the soil and vegetation data were from field observations carried out during 2011 2013 in 2011 we collected soil cores of 10 m deep under three land use types including farmlands f and orchards with apple trees of two stand ages 20 years old a20 30 years old a30 we determined the soil texture and vertical root distribution to get the soil hydraulic parameter and root parameters respectively wang et al 2015b we measured the dynamic changes in soil water contents and leaf area index for data collection and detailed measurement methods see supplementary material text s1 to develop climate change scenarios we collected daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures for the changwu county between 1957 and 2017 simultaneously we obtained monthly data from five esms with scenarios including historical hindcast for the period of 1961 2005 and four representative concentration pathways rcps 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 for the period of 2011 2040 2020s landman 2010 the information on esms and emission scenarios is presented in table 1 2 3 simulating soil water balance fig 2 presented the overall flow chart of this study the hydrus 1d model was employed to simulate and decompose different components of swb to simulate swb under different land use and climate scenarios a modified form of the richards s equation was used for one dimensional water flow see text s2 in supplementary materials richards 1931 the soil water observations between 2011 09 23 and 2013 10 31 were used to calibrate and validate the hydrus 1d model and the details can be found in our previous study focusing on the land use change impacts on swb li et al 2019a see text s3 in the supplementary materials this study briefly described the model evaluation results the 10 m soil profile was partitioned into five layers for simulation according to the vertical distribution of soil texture the root water uptake hydraulic parameters and potential evapotranspiration were estimated by the feddes s equation feddes et al 1974 van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 and hargreaves equation hargreaves 1994 respectively compared with two year continuous observations of soil water contents at multiple depths the model performed well for example the coefficient of determination root mean square error and nash model efficiency coefficient for the hydrus 1d model to simulate soil water in farmlands were 0 65 0 02 0 55 for the calibration period and 0 85 0 01 0 76 for the validation period respectively the above indices were similar under apple orchards then the relative error of the water mass balance within the 10 m profiles ranged from 0 to 0 2 table s2 and 0 0 4 table 3 under the current 1960 2013 and future 2011 2040 climate and indicated that the simulated swb was within an acceptable error range in addition we compared the partitioned hydrological components such as deep drainage and actual evapotranspiration with those from literatures li et al 2019a and confirmed a good model performance and applicability despite some uncertainties discussed in our previous study the hydrus 1d model is promising in simulating swb in the study area 2 4 developing climate change scenarios a multivariate downscaling procedure using the two stage weather generator tswg was employed to prepare potential climate change scenarios li 2014 for more details on downscaling we refer to li and jin 2017 and li et al 2017 briefly the grid scale monthly outputs of esms for each climatic variable e g precipitation maximum and minimum temperature were downscaled to daily data of the target station and then rebuilt the inter variable correlation to reproduce the current weather events the method stochastically generates climate change scenarios emphasizing reproduction of the target statistical characteristics of future climate to obtain accurate results of climate change impacts the transferability of projected climate changes to hydrological simulation must evaluated the direct evaluation of model performance by comparing the observed and generated climate statistics showed a high reliability of the downscaling method li et al 2017 this study instead conducted an indirect evaluation by comparing the observed mean annual et with the simulated values using generated climate as inputs of hydrus 1d specifically the observed daily climate was used to stochastically generate daily climate series for 100 years with tswg and then the observed and generated climate data were used in the hydrus 1d model as the hydrus 1d model requires daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as inputs we calculated the potential evapotranspiration under different land uses following the hargreaves method hargreaves et al 1985 the three climate series produced similar mean annual et of the full period of the climate scenarios the mean annual et simulated with the observed and generated climate were 577 8 and 582 2 mm under f 583 3 and 585 3 mm under a20 and 584 5 and 587 4 mm under a30 respectively this suggested that the downscaling technique can be used to generate climate change scenarios to satisfactorily simulate swb 2 5 analyzing climate and land use change effects on soil water balance as this study focuses on the dominance of climate and land use on swb we first analyzed the historical climate change during 1957 2017 and simulated swb for the whole historical period and two sub periods separated by the change point detected by the pettitt test the non parametric approach developed by pettitt 1979 was used in this study for determining the occurrence of a change point this approach detects a significant change in the mean of a time series when the exact time of the change is unknown the test uses a version of the mann whitney statistic ut n that verifies if two samples x1 xt and xt 1 xn are from the same population the test statistic counts the number of times a member of the first sample exceeds a member of the second sample second we projected future climate change and the corresponding swb for the 2020s under four rcps from five esms with these simulations we increased the sample size of the climate vegetation swb system for example the historical period had three land use types and two sub periods of climate data which resulted in six swb results similarly the 2020s had three land use types and 18 climate change scenarios leading to 54 swb results with 60 swb results from the combinations of climate and vegetation we discussed the effects of climate change and land use alteration on swb with a large sample size we first quantified the climate change impacts on swb under different land use types the wavelet coherency was used to quantify the correlation between each swb component and each climatic factor under farmland at monthly scale for the period 1957 2017 the wavelet coherency quantified the correlation of paired variables e g precipitation versus deep drainage at different scales and locations li et al 2019c torrence and compo 1998 and help quantify dynamic changes in the inter variable correlation the wavelet coherency was obtained from the monte carlo method at 95 confidence level the percentage area of significant coherency pasc relative to the total wavelet domain was used to quantify the correlations between variables hu and si 2016 then we identified the climatic variables and their statistical parameters controlling swb under different land use types using a univariate linear regression as mean and variance determine the long term average and extremes of climate and have major effects on hydrology meehl et al 2000 we developed relationships between the changes in the variances and means of annual precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures with those of annual swb finally we investigated the dominant role of climate and land use in swb by quantifying the effects of one factor while fixing the other factor for example under the same climate change scenario the swb changes under apple orchards relative to farmlands were the land use change effects on the other hand under the same land use type the swb changes between the two periods were the climate change effects 3 results 3 1 historical and future climate change for the period 1957 2017 the mean annual precipitation and mean temperature were 585 0 128 0 mm and 9 4 0 6 c respectively fig 3a b the annual total precipitation changed insignificantly while the annual mean temperature significantly increased at a rate of 0 02 c year 1 further the pettitt test showed that precipitation had an insignificant abrupt change in 1990 while temperature abruptly changed significantly in 1993 p 0 05 respectively fig 3c d as the change points for precipitation and temperature were close to each other the year 1990 was considered as a single critical point considering the dominant role of precipitation on regional water inputs over temperature following this the period 1957 2017 was split into two sub periods i e 1957 1990 and 1991 2017 to further analyze the changes in climate the mean annual precipitation and temperature were 596 2 127 3 mm and 9 1 0 4 c for the first sub period 1957 1990 and were 570 9 130 0 mm and 9 8 0 6 c for the second sub period 1991 2017 compared with the first sub period the climate became drier and warmer in the second sub period as the mean annual precipitation decreased by 4 2 and the mean temperature increased by 0 6 c further the standard deviations increased from 127 3 to 130 0 mm for annual precipitation from 0 8 to 0 7 c for tmax and from 0 3 to 0 6 c for tmin implying that the extreme climate events tended to increase in the second sub period the year 2003 had annual precipitation of 954 3 mm which was 63 higher than the long term average and was a record high since 1957 following the ipcc ar5 the period 1961 2005 was used as a baseline for esm downscaling and predict the climate in 2020s overall the climate would be drier and warmer under higher rcps table 2 averaged across all scenarios the mean annual precipitation is likely to insignificantly decrease but the maximum and minimum temperature appeared to significantly increase by 1 6 0 4 and 1 2 0 2 c respectively meanwhile the variances of precipitation and temperature would increase under most scenarios table 2 over all scenarios the ratios of variance in precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures were 1 03 0 07 1 07 0 08 and 1 02 0 06 respectively it suggested that the climate in 2020s would be more variable with more extreme climate events indicated by a t test the increase in relative changes and variance ratios was significant for temperature but was not significant for precipitation 3 2 soil water balance under land use and climate scenarios fig 4 shows the interannual variability of each swb component under the farmland in the historical period 1957 2017 the interannual variations in actual evapotranspiration et and changes of soil water storage s were consistent with those of precipitation however the response of deep drainage d at 10 m exhibited time lags for example the largest annual precipitation in 2003 since 1957 resulted in the corresponding largest s 299 0 mm but the d began to increase only in 2005 similarly the largest d in 1978 was attributed to the annual precipitation of 810 9 mm in 1975 we further explored the response of d to precipitation by the cross correlation analysis and found that the maximum time lag of d relative to precipitation was four years the swb in the whole historical period and two sub periods were further simulated under the three land use types table 3 as runoff r and s were negligible see columns 4 and 7 of table 3 et and d are the focus of this section in the three periods the farmland had a mean annual et of 558 7 580 9 mm and mean annual d of 10 2 13 1 mm however in each period d was reduced to near zero with farmland converted to aged apple orchards while et increased with increasing stand age of apple trees specifically the et and d under the aged apple trees were respectively 571 1 594 3 and 0 2 0 3 mm year 1 overall the decrease in d was likely caused by the increase in et under farmland the drier and warmer climate in 1991 2017 decreased et and d relative to 1957 1990 for example et and d values were 580 9 and 13 1 mm year 1 during 1957 1990 and 558 7 and 10 2 mm year 1 during 1991 2017 under the aged apple trees though the et and s decreased d almost did no change it should be noted that the decrease in s under aged apple trees was greater than that under farmland which was probably the contribution of more developed root system and more water uptake stressed by the drier climate the changes in each swb components in the 2020s relative to the baseline period under different rcps and esms scenarios are presented in fig 5 averaged over all rcp scenarios the drier and warmer climate in the 2020s significantly increased et by 4 2 5 9 under farmland 3 4 6 4 under a20 and 3 4 6 3 under a30 with a decrease in precipitation and an increase in et s significantly decreased by 2 5 1 0 3 1 0 8 and 2 8 1 1 mm year 1 under f a20 and a30 respectively consequently the reduced availability of soil water would further significantly decrease d by 5 5 4 mm year 1 under farmland however the d changes under apple orchard were negligible since the d were already close to zeros under the same rcps scenarios changes in et under f was greater than those under a20 and a30 which was a result of intensified evaporation rather than transpiration averaged over all esm scenarios the drier and warmer climate in the 2020s significantly decreased et by 2 5 1 0 under farmland 3 1 0 8 under a20 and 2 8 1 1 under a30 with the decrease in precipitation and et s and d all significantly decreased further the change magnitude of s and d under averaged over all esms scenarios are the same as averaged over all rcps scenarios specifically the impact of different rcps and esms scenarios on swb is mainly reflected in et variance 3 3 relationship between soil water balance and climate change the correlation between swb and relevant climate factors was quantified by the bivariate wavelet coherency each swb component was always significantly correlated to precipitation and mean temperature at scales of around one year this indicated seasonal variations in climate and soil hydrology fig 6 et and s were positively correlated to precipitation while the connection of d with precipitation changed with scales fig 6a c e for example d was positively correlated to precipitation at scales of around one year in most years but it was negatively correlated to precipitation at scales 64 months in some limited years one interesting finding is that d was positively correlated to precipitation at scales of 16 64 months for 1957 1960 1976 1979 and 2002 2008 which was probably related to the extremely high annual precipitation in 1958 1975 and 2003 respectively fig 6c similar to precipitation the connection of swb with temperature changed with scales fig 6b d f at scales of around one year each swb component was always positively correlated to mean temperature in general higher temperatures led to greater et smaller d and s however in this study the hydrologic components were all positively correlated with temperature due to positive correlation of high precipitation years with higher average temperature in the loess plateau some spurious correlations with average temperature at scales 64 months were observed and suggested the dominance of precipitation further the precipitation corresponded to the greatest pasc for et and s 66 3 at multiple scale location domains these results highlighted the dominance of precipitation in controlling swb precipitation was positively correlated with et and s but it was negatively correlated to d at large scales indicating the long residence time of precipitation for groundwater recharge huang et al 2018 2019a to connect climate change with swb variability the trends or changes in climatic variables have been qualitatively compared with those in swb components kusangaya et al 2014 seneviratne et al 2010 however the dominance of different climatic variables or and their statistical parameters on swb changes have rarely been quantified the variances of precipitation and temperature had greater impacts on the swb components than the means table 4 for example an 1 increase in precipitation variances and means changed et means and variances by 0 68 55 25 and 0 003 1 16 while an 1 increase in temperature variances and means changed et means and variances by 9 43 1 00 and 2 03 3 25 respectively similarly climate change had greater impacts on the means than variances of swb components table 4 for example an 1 increase in the means or variances of precipitation changed et means and variances by 1 16 55 25 and 0 003 0 68 while an 1 increase in the means or variances of temperature changed et means and variances by 9 43 3 25 and 0 06 0 29 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 how does soil water balance connect with climate change precipitation and temperature are two key climatic factors controlling the regional total water amount since they determine the input and output of water respectively isabelle et al 2020 lu et al 2019 wang et al 2018 considering the significance level of the sensitivity analysis and the results of the bivariate wavelet coherency the dominant climatic factor controlling swb changes was precipitation although higher temperatures often suggest an increased ability of evapotranspiration niu et al 2019 the temperature increase had insignificant impacts on swb because of the overall downward trend in annual precipitation in the study region the dominance of climatic factors in different regions may be determined by the balance between water and energy i e the regions with limited water resources are generally dominated by water while those with plenty of water are generally dominated by energy deng et al 2015 pauwels and wood 1999 valayamkunnath et al 2019 yang et al 2007 the study area has limited water resources and thus the hydrological processes are dominated by water availability or precipitation further understanding the sensitivity of water budgets to different statistical parameters of the same climatic variable is important for water resource management arnell and gosling 2016 hirabayashi et al 2013 li and jin 2017 porporato et al 2004 zhang et al 2020 in this study we found that the main statistical parameter controlling swb variability was variance over mean of precipitation as rainfall variances determine the occurrence of extreme rainfall events landman 2010 rainstorms have greater impacts on swb variability the study area under investigation has an insignificant downward trend in annual precipitation but the variances of precipitation significantly increased for both historical and future periods tables 3 and 4 it suggested that the climate in the study area would have more extreme rainfall events and thus swb variability from the change in precipitation variance researches have shown that precipitation is the primary control of swb at larger spatial scales and extreme precipitation events result in recharge of deep soil water and groundwater arnell and gosling 2016 holman 2005 li and jin 2017 liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 as the loess plateau has large evapotranspiration demand and limited water resources extreme precipitation events could play an important role in regulating swb liu et al 2010 shao et al 2018 the increased climate variability would alleviate the soil water and groundwater depletion because overexploitation by deep rooted plants arnell and gosling 2016 holman 2005 li and jin 2017 liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 4 2 dominance of climate and land use changes in soil water balance the changes in climate and land use both affect swb kundu et al 2017 however it is necessary to identify the dominant factors for adaptation the swb changes under the same land use type but with different climate change scenarios were combined to calculate the climate change effects similarly the swb changes under various land use but with the same climate were combined to estimate the land use change effects overall et increased by 0 3 2 8 with a mean value of 1 4 from land use change while it changed by 6 7 17 0 with a mean value of 3 3 from climate change fig 7a similarly d changed by 15 4 to 2 8 mm average 7 8 mm from land use change while by 9 6 2 8 mm average 1 9 mm from climate change fig 7b s changed by 1 6 2 6 mm with a mean value of 0 8 mm because of land use change while it changed by 4 4 0 1 mm with a mean value of 2 8 mm because of climate change fig 7c overall climate change may have a more prominent effect on et change while land use change may have greater impacts on d the dominant effect of land use on d is mainly due to the different intensity of hydrological redistribution or water partitioning by different land use types favreau et al 2009 skerlep et al 2019 generally trees transpire more water and lose more water from precipitation interception than farmland and thus d generation is usually higher in areas with more farmland grass cover than forest cover anache et al 2019 li et al 2019b zhang and wang 2018 therefore compared with et which is susceptible to climate change d in the deep loessial vadose zone is dominated by land use however the response of s had different change directions implying that land use pattern adjustment could mitigate the infaust impacts of climate change the dominance of climate and land use in swb changes vary with regions or swb components for example land use change had stronger impacts on et and d than the projected climate change in a humid scottish catchment with mean annual precipitation of 1000 mm wang et al 2018 berihun et al 2019 concluded that land use alteration dominated the runoff and et than climate change for the period 1982 2016 within the upper blue nile basin in ethiopia under wetter 1022 2495 mm and colder 15 25 c climate change our previous study for the groundwater recharge in the loess plateau showed that the long term groundwater recharge was dominated by climate but the short term variations can be attributed to both climate and land use change hu et al 2019 this study presented new information about the role of climate and land use changes in the arid region with thick unsaturated zones 4 3 what are the implications on agricultural management and water resources the high water demands of deep rooted plants result in decreasing soil water storage as the tree gets older cao et al 2018 consequently the aged apple trees gradually reduced deep drainage it is thus important to remove the apple orchards at an appropriate age to maintain sustainable groundwater resources the climate in the study region tended to be warmer and drier and more extreme climate events are expected for the future periods li and jin 2017 sun et al 2019 in turn the spatiotemporal distribution intensity and frequency of swb components would be changed lu et al 2019 mahmood and jia 2019 and subsequently influence the ecological restoration for example the areas with new afforestation increased from 8 6 103 to 120 46 103 km2 in ningxia shaanxi and shanxi province for the period 1998 2003 zhao et al 2017 however the newly planted trees only had a survival rate 24 wang et al 2007 with potential warmer and drier climate in the future the success of planted trees would be further challenged feng et al 2016 ge et al 2019 thus climate change should be considered for the sustainability of agriculture and water resources 5 conclusions to differentiate the effects of climate change and land use alteration on swb we applied the hydrus 1d model to quantify the swb components under multiple climate change scenarios and land use types the results show that considering the effect of climate change the changes in precipitation variances dominated swb variations our results demonstrate that climate change had a more prominent effect on the changes in et while land use change played a more important role in controlling d as such the quantification and

wavelet analysis loess plateau hydrus 1d model 1 introduction soil water is an important water resource connecting the atmosphere hydrosphere lithosphere and biosphere legates et al 2011 however it has been threatened by changes in climate and land use worldwide lu et al 2019 porporato et al 2004 sen 2009 seneviratne et al 2010 vorosmarty et al 2000 the climate change impacts on soil water balance swb mainly come from changes in spatial and temporal patterns of climatic variables such as rainfall and temperature dayon et al 2018 kim and stricker 1996 loaiciga et al 1996 while the land use change impacts on swb mainly comes from different characteristics of plants such as the root system and coverage li et al 2018 lin et al 2019 scott and biederman 2019 while researches have explored the connection of either climate or land use changes with swb it is critical to quantify the potential changes in swb within different land uses under changing climate the climate and land use changes affect swb at different time scales in general the intra and inter annual variability of climate affect swb both at intra annual and longer time scales dayon et al 2018 mahmood and jia 2019 whereas the seasonal variations and continuous growth of plants influence swb either rapidly or chronically liu et al 2019 this further complicates the identification of the dominance of climate and land use on swb in some cases climate change influenced swb less dramatically than land use change strasser et al 2019 warburton et al 2010 however the opposite also has been reported by others researchers zheng et al 2019 zipper et al 2018 thus differentiation of climate and land use change impacts on swb can help guide future strategies to manage land and water more sustainably the changes in the means and extremes of climate have different effects on water cycle for example the extreme climate events are of increasing concerns since they can lead to more disasters than single change in the mean values hirabayashi et al 2013 porporato et al 2004 similarly extreme precipitation events can influence flood and soil erosion differently with changes in frequency over intensity arnell and gosling 2016 li and jin 2017 zhang et al 2020 the increased variability in precipitation may increase groundwater recharge as intensive rainfalls may ultimately increase infiltration and recharge of water table holman 2005 liu et al 2010 focusing on the changes in mean climate the climate change effects on swb can be partially interpreted however a small change in mean values may be a result of large changes in extreme events galbraith et al 2010 isabelle et al 2020 shen et al 2020 therefore it is important to investigate the connection of mean and extreme climate with swb and further identify their dominance with this information the adaptation to climate change can be discussed for agriculture or water resources the regions sensitive and vulnerable to climate and land use changes should receive more attention loaiciga et al 1996 porporato et al 2004 sen 2009 seneviratne et al 2010 for example the loess plateau located in subhumid to arid regions of china has experienced significant climate and land use changes and subsequently impacted the hydrological system li et al 2010 a significant increase in temperature with insignificant change in precipitation has resulted in an imbalance in surface water budget by 20 6 chen et al 2010 zhang et al 2011 vegetation cover has increased from 31 6 in 1999 to 59 6 in 2013 of the total area as a result of the grain for green project s initiative to plant trees and improve grasslands huang et al 2019b wang et al 2015a the conversion from cropland to forestland has also reached 1 0 105 km2 in 2020 all these greatly decreased surface runoff and help achieve the sustainable water resource limits feng et al 2016 however it is not clear how these land use changes will impact the hydrology under potential changing climate scenario in this area and should be studied to make the ecosystem sustainable the soil water storage is huge in the loess plateau with loess up to 350 m deep zhu et al 2019 however the depletion of soil water and groundwater has been observed in many regions potentially induced by large scale transformation from shallow to deep rooted plants huang and pang 2010 wang et al 2010 without enough soil water the sustainability of the vegetation pattern has been doubted in recent years however the afforestation of both deciduous and evergreen species will continue since the government announced a target of 30 forest coverage by 2050 while the current forest cover is 22 ge et al 2019 under the background of changing climate more attention should be paid to quantify whether the climate and soil water reservoirs sustain the current and targeted land use pattern this study aimed at evaluating the climate and land use change effects on swb and further to differentiate their dominant role specifically we asked the following questions i how does climate change influence swb for different land use types ii between climate and land use changes which factor plays dominant role in swb changes iii what are the implications of changing climate and land use on the management of agriculture and water resources we answered these questions using information from field experiments and modeling work the information will be helpful for adaptive management of water and vegetation under the current and future climate in the study area and similar regions elsewhere 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experiment was conducted at the changwu loess tableland fig 1 with typical rainfed agriculture and apple orchards that were converted from farmland the tableland has a flat surface with an elevation of 1220 m the long term 1957 2017 annual average precipitation is 585 0 mm the mean annual air temperature is 9 4 c and the mean annual potential evapotranspiration is 1015 4 mm the soil is a typical loessic soil with a silty clay loam texture according to the fao soil classification system fao unesco 1988 the water table in this region varied from 30 to 100 m below the soil surface wang et al 2010 the dominant land use types on the tableland are farmland and apple orchard but the apple orchards are converted from farmlands up to 30 years old as such the plateau has been identified as a susceptible area to changing climate and changes in land use such as afforestation has already increased vegetation cover decreased soil erosion and soil water storage huang and gallichand 2006 the study area is thus a good platform to analyze the connection of land use change with swb under changing climate 2 2 data collection to investigate the impacts of climate and land use changes on swb we required two datasets one for swb simulation and the other for climate change scenarios development we collected field data from the changwu agroecological experimental station on the loess plateau chinese academy of sciences fig 1 and used for swb simulation we used hydrus 1d model to simulate swb with inputs of various climate soil and vegetation depending on the regions under investigation šimůnek et al 2008 the climate data included both the observation and the downscaled earth system models esm the soil and vegetation data were from field observations carried out during 2011 2013 in 2011 we collected soil cores of 10 m deep under three land use types including farmlands f and orchards with apple trees of two stand ages 20 years old a20 30 years old a30 we determined the soil texture and vertical root distribution to get the soil hydraulic parameter and root parameters respectively wang et al 2015b we measured the dynamic changes in soil water contents and leaf area index for data collection and detailed measurement methods see supplementary material text s1 to develop climate change scenarios we collected daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures for the changwu county between 1957 and 2017 simultaneously we obtained monthly data from five esms with scenarios including historical hindcast for the period of 1961 2005 and four representative concentration pathways rcps 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 for the period of 2011 2040 2020s landman 2010 the information on esms and emission scenarios is presented in table 1 2 3 simulating soil water balance fig 2 presented the overall flow chart of this study the hydrus 1d model was employed to simulate and decompose different components of swb to simulate swb under different land use and climate scenarios a modified form of the richards s equation was used for one dimensional water flow see text s2 in supplementary materials richards 1931 the soil water observations between 2011 09 23 and 2013 10 31 were used to calibrate and validate the hydrus 1d model and the details can be found in our previous study focusing on the land use change impacts on swb li et al 2019a see text s3 in the supplementary materials this study briefly described the model evaluation results the 10 m soil profile was partitioned into five layers for simulation according to the vertical distribution of soil texture the root water uptake hydraulic parameters and potential evapotranspiration were estimated by the feddes s equation feddes et al 1974 van genuchten mualem model van genuchten 1980 and hargreaves equation hargreaves 1994 respectively compared with two year continuous observations of soil water contents at multiple depths the model performed well for example the coefficient of determination root mean square error and nash model efficiency coefficient for the hydrus 1d model to simulate soil water in farmlands were 0 65 0 02 0 55 for the calibration period and 0 85 0 01 0 76 for the validation period respectively the above indices were similar under apple orchards then the relative error of the water mass balance within the 10 m profiles ranged from 0 to 0 2 table s2 and 0 0 4 table 3 under the current 1960 2013 and future 2011 2040 climate and indicated that the simulated swb was within an acceptable error range in addition we compared the partitioned hydrological components such as deep drainage and actual evapotranspiration with those from literatures li et al 2019a and confirmed a good model performance and applicability despite some uncertainties discussed in our previous study the hydrus 1d model is promising in simulating swb in the study area 2 4 developing climate change scenarios a multivariate downscaling procedure using the two stage weather generator tswg was employed to prepare potential climate change scenarios li 2014 for more details on downscaling we refer to li and jin 2017 and li et al 2017 briefly the grid scale monthly outputs of esms for each climatic variable e g precipitation maximum and minimum temperature were downscaled to daily data of the target station and then rebuilt the inter variable correlation to reproduce the current weather events the method stochastically generates climate change scenarios emphasizing reproduction of the target statistical characteristics of future climate to obtain accurate results of climate change impacts the transferability of projected climate changes to hydrological simulation must evaluated the direct evaluation of model performance by comparing the observed and generated climate statistics showed a high reliability of the downscaling method li et al 2017 this study instead conducted an indirect evaluation by comparing the observed mean annual et with the simulated values using generated climate as inputs of hydrus 1d specifically the observed daily climate was used to stochastically generate daily climate series for 100 years with tswg and then the observed and generated climate data were used in the hydrus 1d model as the hydrus 1d model requires daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as inputs we calculated the potential evapotranspiration under different land uses following the hargreaves method hargreaves et al 1985 the three climate series produced similar mean annual et of the full period of the climate scenarios the mean annual et simulated with the observed and generated climate were 577 8 and 582 2 mm under f 583 3 and 585 3 mm under a20 and 584 5 and 587 4 mm under a30 respectively this suggested that the downscaling technique can be used to generate climate change scenarios to satisfactorily simulate swb 2 5 analyzing climate and land use change effects on soil water balance as this study focuses on the dominance of climate and land use on swb we first analyzed the historical climate change during 1957 2017 and simulated swb for the whole historical period and two sub periods separated by the change point detected by the pettitt test the non parametric approach developed by pettitt 1979 was used in this study for determining the occurrence of a change point this approach detects a significant change in the mean of a time series when the exact time of the change is unknown the test uses a version of the mann whitney statistic ut n that verifies if two samples x1 xt and xt 1 xn are from the same population the test statistic counts the number of times a member of the first sample exceeds a member of the second sample second we projected future climate change and the corresponding swb for the 2020s under four rcps from five esms with these simulations we increased the sample size of the climate vegetation swb system for example the historical period had three land use types and two sub periods of climate data which resulted in six swb results similarly the 2020s had three land use types and 18 climate change scenarios leading to 54 swb results with 60 swb results from the combinations of climate and vegetation we discussed the effects of climate change and land use alteration on swb with a large sample size we first quantified the climate change impacts on swb under different land use types the wavelet coherency was used to quantify the correlation between each swb component and each climatic factor under farmland at monthly scale for the period 1957 2017 the wavelet coherency quantified the correlation of paired variables e g precipitation versus deep drainage at different scales and locations li et al 2019c torrence and compo 1998 and help quantify dynamic changes in the inter variable correlation the wavelet coherency was obtained from the monte carlo method at 95 confidence level the percentage area of significant coherency pasc relative to the total wavelet domain was used to quantify the correlations between variables hu and si 2016 then we identified the climatic variables and their statistical parameters controlling swb under different land use types using a univariate linear regression as mean and variance determine the long term average and extremes of climate and have major effects on hydrology meehl et al 2000 we developed relationships between the changes in the variances and means of annual precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures with those of annual swb finally we investigated the dominant role of climate and land use in swb by quantifying the effects of one factor while fixing the other factor for example under the same climate change scenario the swb changes under apple orchards relative to farmlands were the land use change effects on the other hand under the same land use type the swb changes between the two periods were the climate change effects 3 results 3 1 historical and future climate change for the period 1957 2017 the mean annual precipitation and mean temperature were 585 0 128 0 mm and 9 4 0 6 c respectively fig 3a b the annual total precipitation changed insignificantly while the annual mean temperature significantly increased at a rate of 0 02 c year 1 further the pettitt test showed that precipitation had an insignificant abrupt change in 1990 while temperature abruptly changed significantly in 1993 p 0 05 respectively fig 3c d as the change points for precipitation and temperature were close to each other the year 1990 was considered as a single critical point considering the dominant role of precipitation on regional water inputs over temperature following this the period 1957 2017 was split into two sub periods i e 1957 1990 and 1991 2017 to further analyze the changes in climate the mean annual precipitation and temperature were 596 2 127 3 mm and 9 1 0 4 c for the first sub period 1957 1990 and were 570 9 130 0 mm and 9 8 0 6 c for the second sub period 1991 2017 compared with the first sub period the climate became drier and warmer in the second sub period as the mean annual precipitation decreased by 4 2 and the mean temperature increased by 0 6 c further the standard deviations increased from 127 3 to 130 0 mm for annual precipitation from 0 8 to 0 7 c for tmax and from 0 3 to 0 6 c for tmin implying that the extreme climate events tended to increase in the second sub period the year 2003 had annual precipitation of 954 3 mm which was 63 higher than the long term average and was a record high since 1957 following the ipcc ar5 the period 1961 2005 was used as a baseline for esm downscaling and predict the climate in 2020s overall the climate would be drier and warmer under higher rcps table 2 averaged across all scenarios the mean annual precipitation is likely to insignificantly decrease but the maximum and minimum temperature appeared to significantly increase by 1 6 0 4 and 1 2 0 2 c respectively meanwhile the variances of precipitation and temperature would increase under most scenarios table 2 over all scenarios the ratios of variance in precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures were 1 03 0 07 1 07 0 08 and 1 02 0 06 respectively it suggested that the climate in 2020s would be more variable with more extreme climate events indicated by a t test the increase in relative changes and variance ratios was significant for temperature but was not significant for precipitation 3 2 soil water balance under land use and climate scenarios fig 4 shows the interannual variability of each swb component under the farmland in the historical period 1957 2017 the interannual variations in actual evapotranspiration et and changes of soil water storage s were consistent with those of precipitation however the response of deep drainage d at 10 m exhibited time lags for example the largest annual precipitation in 2003 since 1957 resulted in the corresponding largest s 299 0 mm but the d began to increase only in 2005 similarly the largest d in 1978 was attributed to the annual precipitation of 810 9 mm in 1975 we further explored the response of d to precipitation by the cross correlation analysis and found that the maximum time lag of d relative to precipitation was four years the swb in the whole historical period and two sub periods were further simulated under the three land use types table 3 as runoff r and s were negligible see columns 4 and 7 of table 3 et and d are the focus of this section in the three periods the farmland had a mean annual et of 558 7 580 9 mm and mean annual d of 10 2 13 1 mm however in each period d was reduced to near zero with farmland converted to aged apple orchards while et increased with increasing stand age of apple trees specifically the et and d under the aged apple trees were respectively 571 1 594 3 and 0 2 0 3 mm year 1 overall the decrease in d was likely caused by the increase in et under farmland the drier and warmer climate in 1991 2017 decreased et and d relative to 1957 1990 for example et and d values were 580 9 and 13 1 mm year 1 during 1957 1990 and 558 7 and 10 2 mm year 1 during 1991 2017 under the aged apple trees though the et and s decreased d almost did no change it should be noted that the decrease in s under aged apple trees was greater than that under farmland which was probably the contribution of more developed root system and more water uptake stressed by the drier climate the changes in each swb components in the 2020s relative to the baseline period under different rcps and esms scenarios are presented in fig 5 averaged over all rcp scenarios the drier and warmer climate in the 2020s significantly increased et by 4 2 5 9 under farmland 3 4 6 4 under a20 and 3 4 6 3 under a30 with a decrease in precipitation and an increase in et s significantly decreased by 2 5 1 0 3 1 0 8 and 2 8 1 1 mm year 1 under f a20 and a30 respectively consequently the reduced availability of soil water would further significantly decrease d by 5 5 4 mm year 1 under farmland however the d changes under apple orchard were negligible since the d were already close to zeros under the same rcps scenarios changes in et under f was greater than those under a20 and a30 which was a result of intensified evaporation rather than transpiration averaged over all esm scenarios the drier and warmer climate in the 2020s significantly decreased et by 2 5 1 0 under farmland 3 1 0 8 under a20 and 2 8 1 1 under a30 with the decrease in precipitation and et s and d all significantly decreased further the change magnitude of s and d under averaged over all esms scenarios are the same as averaged over all rcps scenarios specifically the impact of different rcps and esms scenarios on swb is mainly reflected in et variance 3 3 relationship between soil water balance and climate change the correlation between swb and relevant climate factors was quantified by the bivariate wavelet coherency each swb component was always significantly correlated to precipitation and mean temperature at scales of around one year this indicated seasonal variations in climate and soil hydrology fig 6 et and s were positively correlated to precipitation while the connection of d with precipitation changed with scales fig 6a c e for example d was positively correlated to precipitation at scales of around one year in most years but it was negatively correlated to precipitation at scales 64 months in some limited years one interesting finding is that d was positively correlated to precipitation at scales of 16 64 months for 1957 1960 1976 1979 and 2002 2008 which was probably related to the extremely high annual precipitation in 1958 1975 and 2003 respectively fig 6c similar to precipitation the connection of swb with temperature changed with scales fig 6b d f at scales of around one year each swb component was always positively correlated to mean temperature in general higher temperatures led to greater et smaller d and s however in this study the hydrologic components were all positively correlated with temperature due to positive correlation of high precipitation years with higher average temperature in the loess plateau some spurious correlations with average temperature at scales 64 months were observed and suggested the dominance of precipitation further the precipitation corresponded to the greatest pasc for et and s 66 3 at multiple scale location domains these results highlighted the dominance of precipitation in controlling swb precipitation was positively correlated with et and s but it was negatively correlated to d at large scales indicating the long residence time of precipitation for groundwater recharge huang et al 2018 2019a to connect climate change with swb variability the trends or changes in climatic variables have been qualitatively compared with those in swb components kusangaya et al 2014 seneviratne et al 2010 however the dominance of different climatic variables or and their statistical parameters on swb changes have rarely been quantified the variances of precipitation and temperature had greater impacts on the swb components than the means table 4 for example an 1 increase in precipitation variances and means changed et means and variances by 0 68 55 25 and 0 003 1 16 while an 1 increase in temperature variances and means changed et means and variances by 9 43 1 00 and 2 03 3 25 respectively similarly climate change had greater impacts on the means than variances of swb components table 4 for example an 1 increase in the means or variances of precipitation changed et means and variances by 1 16 55 25 and 0 003 0 68 while an 1 increase in the means or variances of temperature changed et means and variances by 9 43 3 25 and 0 06 0 29 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 how does soil water balance connect with climate change precipitation and temperature are two key climatic factors controlling the regional total water amount since they determine the input and output of water respectively isabelle et al 2020 lu et al 2019 wang et al 2018 considering the significance level of the sensitivity analysis and the results of the bivariate wavelet coherency the dominant climatic factor controlling swb changes was precipitation although higher temperatures often suggest an increased ability of evapotranspiration niu et al 2019 the temperature increase had insignificant impacts on swb because of the overall downward trend in annual precipitation in the study region the dominance of climatic factors in different regions may be determined by the balance between water and energy i e the regions with limited water resources are generally dominated by water while those with plenty of water are generally dominated by energy deng et al 2015 pauwels and wood 1999 valayamkunnath et al 2019 yang et al 2007 the study area has limited water resources and thus the hydrological processes are dominated by water availability or precipitation further understanding the sensitivity of water budgets to different statistical parameters of the same climatic variable is important for water resource management arnell and gosling 2016 hirabayashi et al 2013 li and jin 2017 porporato et al 2004 zhang et al 2020 in this study we found that the main statistical parameter controlling swb variability was variance over mean of precipitation as rainfall variances determine the occurrence of extreme rainfall events landman 2010 rainstorms have greater impacts on swb variability the study area under investigation has an insignificant downward trend in annual precipitation but the variances of precipitation significantly increased for both historical and future periods tables 3 and 4 it suggested that the climate in the study area would have more extreme rainfall events and thus swb variability from the change in precipitation variance researches have shown that precipitation is the primary control of swb at larger spatial scales and extreme precipitation events result in recharge of deep soil water and groundwater arnell and gosling 2016 holman 2005 li and jin 2017 liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 as the loess plateau has large evapotranspiration demand and limited water resources extreme precipitation events could play an important role in regulating swb liu et al 2010 shao et al 2018 the increased climate variability would alleviate the soil water and groundwater depletion because overexploitation by deep rooted plants arnell and gosling 2016 holman 2005 li and jin 2017 liu et al 2010 zhang et al 2020 4 2 dominance of climate and land use changes in soil water balance the changes in climate and land use both affect swb kundu et al 2017 however it is necessary to identify the dominant factors for adaptation the swb changes under the same land use type but with different climate change scenarios were combined to calculate the climate change effects similarly the swb changes under various land use but with the same climate were combined to estimate the land use change effects overall et increased by 0 3 2 8 with a mean value of 1 4 from land use change while it changed by 6 7 17 0 with a mean value of 3 3 from climate change fig 7a similarly d changed by 15 4 to 2 8 mm average 7 8 mm from land use change while by 9 6 2 8 mm average 1 9 mm from climate change fig 7b s changed by 1 6 2 6 mm with a mean value of 0 8 mm because of land use change while it changed by 4 4 0 1 mm with a mean value of 2 8 mm because of climate change fig 7c overall climate change may have a more prominent effect on et change while land use change may have greater impacts on d the dominant effect of land use on d is mainly due to the different intensity of hydrological redistribution or water partitioning by different land use types favreau et al 2009 skerlep et al 2019 generally trees transpire more water and lose more water from precipitation interception than farmland and thus d generation is usually higher in areas with more farmland grass cover than forest cover anache et al 2019 li et al 2019b zhang and wang 2018 therefore compared with et which is susceptible to climate change d in the deep loessial vadose zone is dominated by land use however the response of s had different change directions implying that land use pattern adjustment could mitigate the infaust impacts of climate change the dominance of climate and land use in swb changes vary with regions or swb components for example land use change had stronger impacts on et and d than the projected climate change in a humid scottish catchment with mean annual precipitation of 1000 mm wang et al 2018 berihun et al 2019 concluded that land use alteration dominated the runoff and et than climate change for the period 1982 2016 within the upper blue nile basin in ethiopia under wetter 1022 2495 mm and colder 15 25 c climate change our previous study for the groundwater recharge in the loess plateau showed that the long term groundwater recharge was dominated by climate but the short term variations can be attributed to both climate and land use change hu et al 2019 this study presented new information about the role of climate and land use changes in the arid region with thick unsaturated zones 4 3 what are the implications on agricultural management and water resources the high water demands of deep rooted plants result in decreasing soil water storage as the tree gets older cao et al 2018 consequently the aged apple trees gradually reduced deep drainage it is thus important to remove the apple orchards at an appropriate age to maintain sustainable groundwater resources the climate in the study region tended to be warmer and drier and more extreme climate events are expected for the future periods li and jin 2017 sun et al 2019 in turn the spatiotemporal distribution intensity and frequency of swb components would be changed lu et al 2019 mahmood and jia 2019 and subsequently influence the ecological restoration for example the areas with new afforestation increased from 8 6 103 to 120 46 103 km2 in ningxia shaanxi and shanxi province for the period 1998 2003 zhao et al 2017 however the newly planted trees only had a survival rate 24 wang et al 2007 with potential warmer and drier climate in the future the success of planted trees would be further challenged feng et al 2016 ge et al 2019 thus climate change should be considered for the sustainability of agriculture and water resources 5 conclusions to differentiate the effects of climate change and land use alteration on swb we applied the hydrus 1d model to quantify the swb components under multiple climate change scenarios and land use types the results show that considering the effect of climate change the changes in precipitation variances dominated swb variations our results demonstrate that climate change had a more prominent effect on the changes in et while land use change played a more important role in controlling d as such the quantification and

and soil physical properties which all need to be taken into account for effective management of vri and fri under vrf frf or pp nitrogen management in different soil types this research quantified the impact of these management practices on soil water dynamics and etc which can be used as a guidance keywords irrigation management nitrogen soil water variable rate management water use vegetative period reproductive period 1 introduction freshwater is a scarce resource and is essential for maintaining an adequate food supply and living environment for humans animal and plants because of increasing population demand for freshwater is becoming greater and is projected to increase more rapidly than the renewable supplies by 2025 postel et al 1996 around 60 of the global population may experience water scarcity by 2025 qadir et al 2007 according to the united nations estimation in order to meet the increasing population s food demands land under cultivation must increase by 40 and the amount of water allocated to irrigation must increase by 14 by 2030 thus there is a pressing need for significant changes and implementing effective approaches in agricultural water management to address the issue of water shortages and increase productivity efficient irrigation water management strategies for maximum water use efficiency are imperative for the sustainability of water resources and crop production two of the most important components in crop production are water and nitrogen and their adequate and timely supply during the growing season studies have reported the substantial influence of soil water availability on crop yield and evapotranspiration etc pandey et al 2000 payero et al 2009 djaman and irmak 2012 deficit soil water can significantly decrease crop yield as compared with adequate available soil water conditions zhang et al 2004 also excessive soil water can sometimes decrease crop yields significantly king et al 2006 irmak 2014 in traditional irrigation management it is usually assumed that the field under consideration is uniform it is a common practice to use a single mean value of crop response to water and etc for deciding water application timing and depth in this research this practice is referred to as uniform or fixed rate irrigation fri which is most practiced globally depending on numerous factors crop response to water can vary in space and time spatio temporal variability due to differences in plant emergence plant density soil water availability spatial soil characteristics field slope and other factors that affect crop growth and nutrient availability which thereby impacts crop yield and quality evans and king 2010 also uniform application of fertilizers fixed rate fertigation frf or pre plant pp nitrogen application can have negative environmental consequences such as pollution of surface and groundwater resources basso et al 2016 pierce and nowak 1999 because of excessive fertilizer application at locations in the field where it is not required coupled with untimely precipitation events and or poor irrigation management the realization and understanding of these challenges and advancements in precision agriculture technologies in the last several decades has also increased the interest in the concept of variable rate irrigation vri and variable rate fertigation vrf to manage spatial and temporal variabilities within agricultural fields evans et al 2013 robert 2002 vri is referred to as applying the right amount of water at the right time and at the right location in a given field it is an irrigation scheduling method based on site specific soil water holding capacity that should be measured determine using real time site specific soil moisture measurements development in the site specific water application technologies made it possible to vary both water and agricultural chemicals fertilizers and pesticides to meet specific needs of the crops in each unique zone within a field different aspects and effectiveness of vri technology using primarily self propelled center pivot or linear move irrigation systems have been studied by several researchers fraisse et al 1995 evans et al 1996 sadler et al 1996 king et al 1999 2009 king and kincaid 2004 han et al 2009 chávez et al 2010a b however most of these researches focused on the development and improvement of hardware and software to implement site specific technology on irrigation systems and to achieve precision in applying water and other chemicals spatially in the field limited studies have been conducted to evaluate the potential benefits of vri in regards to water conservation and impact of vri on the soil water plant relationship soil water dynamics and etc al kufaishi et al 2006 investigated the feasibility of using vri on a 7 ha field with sugar beet in germany using a daily soil water balance simulation model irrigation applications of 20 30 and 40 mm were simulated and management zones were created based on available soil water holding capacity the loss of water was higher for the uniform application scenarios than that for the vri scenarios for the applications of 20 and 30 mm they observed that vri scenario of 20 mm water application was the best option for water conservation hedley and yule 2009 compared vri and uniform irrigation scenarios for three years of climate data on a 156 ha pasture and 53 ha maize field in new zealand the management zones for vri were delineated by relating apparent electrical conductivity with available soil water holding capacity a soil water balance model was used on a daily basis for simulations of irrigation needs the vri scenarios saved 23 26 of irrigation water as compared with uniform irrigation the same model was used by hedley et al 2009 on 40 ha pasture 24 ha potato and 22 ha maize sites in new zealand to evaluate irrigation water use drainage water use nitrogen leaching and other parameters between vri and uniform irrigation scenarios they reported an annual water use reduction of 9 19 under vri as compared with uniform irrigation however in all these studies soil moisture was simulated using models rather than measured data for specific fields and for different sites locations within a field the impact of irrigation scheduling amount and timing based on real or near real time soil moisture measurements on plant water uptake and growth has not been studied sufficiency through field experiments it is not well known if addressing the assumed spatial variations in the field in terms soil properties e g soil texture soil water holding capacity etc will result in water conservation or not while a limited number of studies suggested that there may be a water conservation advantage to vri numerous studies suggested otherwise and the adoption of vri technology has been extremely limited in large scale production fields evans and king 2012 stated that 20 years of private and public research on site specific irrigation has resulted in very limited commercial adoption of the technology they also stated that the primary reason for the very low rate of commercial adoption appears to be the absence of a market for the technology and a low rate of return documented and proven water conservation strategies using vri for crop production are quite limited and its cost effectiveness has not been demonstrated furthermore they suggested that there is very little scientific information documenting the capability of site specific sprinkler irrigation systems to conserve water or energy on a field scale for crop production in either arid or humid environments in addition the hydrologic conditions of reported studies were usually not widespread enough to be able to denote large scale water savings however the vri technology has been evolving and effectiveness robustness and associated benefits have the potential to improve over time through scientific research and development in many regions the lack of plant available soil water generally has the predominant adverse effect on yield understanding the impact of delaying irrigation until a set soil moisture threshold management allowable depletion is reached using soil moisture sensors on soil water dynamics and plant water uptake at different nitrogen levels is critical radin et al 1989 showed an increase in cotton yield when interval between water applications decreased it has been observed that under longer irrigation cycles plants get stressed at the end of the irrigation cycle however frequent irrigations could alleviate this stress allowing the crop to reach its production potential bucks et al 1988 in addition site specific characteristics such as slope and topography interact with nitrogen fertilizer ruffo et al 2006 indicates that terrain attributes as soil water content affect corn yield and its response to nitrogen fertilizer zhou et al 2011 found no significant effect of nitrogen fertilizer rate over 120 kg n ha 1 on soil water storage and corn grain yield in a six year study in shaanxi province china in general plant water uptake is also strongly correlated to root distribution proffitt et al 1985 which has been found to depend on type of irrigation nitrogen fertilizer and availability of soil water phene et al 1991 the first step in understanding the impacts of variable rate application of water and fertilizer on crop response is understanding the variability in soil properties that exist in the field and how these natural variabilities affect the overall dynamics of soil water the knowledge about variability that exists in the soil within a field is fundamental to the development of effective site specific or variable rate management because different soils have different water holding capacities han et al 1996 that impact plant growth development and yield vs water dynamics and et differently soil water dynamics has not been studied in a system that couples vri technology with variable rate fertigation in different soil types simultaneously the objectives of this research were to i to quantify the horizontal and vertical variability in soil properties for three soil types in the same research field so that their influence s can be quantified and accounted for in any potential variation in soil water dynamics and ii evaluate how various nitrogen fertilizer management practices frf vrf and pp under various irrigation management practices vri fri and no irrigation ni affect seasonal soil water trends and cumulative etc at different growth stages of maize quantifying and analyzing such variabilities can provide important information data and guidance to further enhance the effectiveness of variable water and nitrogen management strategies in fields with spatially variability 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and soil sampling this project is part of a larger and ongoing long term project in the irmak research laboratory that also investigated seasonal etc production functions crop water productivity response and economics of maize soybean and sorghum production under vri fri and ni with vrf frf and pre plant fertilizer management in three soil types thus some of the materials and methods including experimental details and cultural practices soil moisture measurements and irrigation management and nitrogen management practices reported in this work and those reported by sharma and irmak 2020 may overlap the irmak research laboratory is located at the university of nebraska lincoln south central agricultural laboratory scal near clay center nebraska the research was conducted in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons on a 2 3 ha field located at latitude 40 34 n and longitude 98 8 w with a west to east elevation gradient in the field ranging from 550 8 m to 552 1 m above mean sea level the long term average annual precipitation at the research site is 680 mm the long term maximum and minimum air temperatures are 25 c and 5 c respectively irmak and mutiibwa 2009 three soil types existed in the research field i crete silt loam 0 1 slope soil 1 s1 ii hastings silty clay loam 3 7 slope soil 2 s2 and iii hastings silt loam 1 3 slope soil 3 s3 fig 1 as reported by sharma and irmak 2020 fixed rate and variable rate water and nitrogen applications were achieved using a two span 75 m long model 7000sl variable rate linear move sprinkler irrigation system tl irrigation co hastings ne the linear move system has a vri that manages the watering regime of the system using up to a maximum of 48 irrigation and fertigation channels 12 zones 4 sprinklers per zone the controllers manage the watering rates of the sprinkler zones by actuating solenoids on off to enable the zones to deliver the desired application rates sprinkler spacing was 1 2 m and sprinklers were mounted on drop tubes at approximately 2 m above the ground level in april of each research year soil samples were collected from 42 locations within the experimental field fig 1 from each sampling location two soil samples per depth were collected at the soil depths of 0 0 30 0 30 0 60 0 60 0 90 0 90 1 20 and 1 20 1 50 m with a giddings soil sampling probe giddings machine co fort collins co two cores from each plot were mixed per soil depth and all soil analyzes were conducted by the ward laboratory kearney ne soil was sampled to determine the existing nitrogen conditions to determine soil fertilizer recommendations and irrigation management in variable rate management of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer a thorough analysis of soil properties is essential for various purposes including determining vri requirements for individual soil layers that have different soil properties rather than assuming a uniform soil layer for the entire crop root zone soils from all depths were analyzed for nitrate n for all three years however at the beginning of the experiment i e for the first soil sampling in april 2015 soil samples were analyzed for bulk density bd electrical conductivity ec organic matter content omc field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp and soil particle size distribution sand silt and clay the fc and pwp values were determined using pressure plate apparatus at 1 3 bar and 15 bar pressure respectively the soil particle size distribution was determined by hydrometer method blake and hartge 1986 since these values do not change in a short period i e three years of research duration same values for these soil properties were used in estimating site specific nitrogen and irrigation requirements for all three years in arcgis software ver 10 1 esri redlands california the inverse distance weighted interpolation method was used to model the spatial distribution of all soil physical properties in the research field 2 2 experimental details and cultural practices in each research year each soil type was divided into 27 plots experimental units where vri and fri and fertigation treatments were randomly assigned to plots in each soil fig 1 each treatment is a combination of three levels of irrigation vri fri and ni and three levels of nitrogen fertilizer fixed rate fertilizer management frf variable rate fertilizer management vrf and pre plant n pp which makes a total 9 treatment combinations fig 1 treatments were randomly assigned to the plots in each growing season the treatment combination of ni and pp nitrogen management was not studied in this research instead ni and no nitrogen combination treatment was evaluated each plot was 6 m 6 m in size with a 6 m 6 m buffer plot on all four sides of each plot fig 1 the buffer plots were established to prevent eliminate sprinkler overlap between the plots sprinkler wetted diameter was 6 m cultural management practices operations for the three years and common practices including planting emergence and fertilizer applications tasseling and harvest dates are shown in table 1 the research field was managed as disk till maize seeds were planted in rows at a depth of 6 3 cm row spacing was 0 76 m and the planting population density was 84 500 plants ha in all years the growing season in this research refers to the time between plating and harvest to determine the value of soil properties for each plot for vri and vrf management extract by mask tool in arcgis was used to extract values from interpolated maps by this method fc pwp omc soil texture and soil nitrate n for each plot was determined based on plot average values of soil properties irrigation and nitrogen amounts were quantified and the details are discussed in the latter sections 2 3 soil moisture measurements irrigation management and nitrogen management irrigation timing and amounts for vri plots were determined by soil matric potential smp values that were measured using watermark granular matrix sensors wgms irrometer co riverside ca installed at four soil depths 0 30 0 60 0 90 and 1 20 m in 20 plots first two replications of each treatment in each soil type wgms were installed in the middle of each plot in the maize row the soil moisture sensors and data logging systems were installed immediately following the crop emergence each year and were removed from the field at the end of each growing season for harvesting wgms were used to monitor smp kpa on an hourly basis which was then converted to volumetric soil water content using soil water retention curves for each soil type for the research site developed and presented in irmak 2019 and irmak et al 2012 2016 for different soil types at clay center ne and in other locations since there were differences in the soil textural properties depthwise in a vertical domain in addition to the horizontal domain for 2016 and 2017 growing seasons soil water retention curves based on soil texture at each soil depth were used in total there were six types of soils existed in the research field these soil types were silt loam silty clay loam clay loam loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam to the best of our knowledge this approach of using different soil characteristic curves to determine vwc for different depths at the same location has not been considered previously for vri and vrf management the volumetric soil water content vwc at each soil depth was then multiplied by the representative depth intervals to determine the total soil water stored sws in each depth and then summed up to obtain total soil water for the 0 1 20 m soil profile for each plot whenever the smp values at any soil depth was below 33 kpa which means soil was at or near field capacity it was adjusted to 33 kpa to prevent very high or erroneous vwc values the total available water taw was calculated by subtracting soil water at pwp from soil water at fc for each plot management allowable depletion mad for all plots was set to 40 of taw irrigation was triggered whenever total soil water stored in the effective rooting depth as represented by smp values was approaching to or below mad crops do not extract water uniformly from the entire root zone throughout the growing season effective rooting depth is the portion of the root zone from where the crop can extract water based on the rooting depth and growth stage of the crop the effective root zone depth for irrigation amount and timing was decided accordingly for each growing season the timing of irrigation for both vri and fri was decided in this manner however for fri plots the amount of irrigation was fixed to be 25 4 mm per irrigation application each time any of the fri plots needed irrigation all fri plots were irrigated with 25 4 mm depth of water considering no variability in the field and assuming that crop responds in the same manner at all locations in the field which is the most commonly used irrigation practice in nebraska and greater midwestern region a total of 1 7 and 10 irrigations were applied to fri plots in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively for vri plots irrigation amounts varied substantially and were applied to bring the soil water to approximately 85 of fc or to maintain 85 of taw to reserve some soil water deficit for any potential precipitation only those plots where soil moisture depletion was greater than mad were irrigated in any irrigation event for vri plots thus the number and amount of irrigation events for each vri plot was different the irrigation dates and amounts for each treatment are presented in table 2 for this research irrigation amounts and timing in each experimental plot was needed prior to irrigation to calculate the irrigation requirements for fri and vri plots to accomplish this the soil moisture sensor data were downloaded from each plot every other day and were uploaded to an irrigation scheduling worksheet that was developed in the irmak research laboratory for each plot based on the plot specific soil properties computed irrigation values were then used to develop water control prescription maps for delivering precise irrigation amount to each experimental unit the final map was then uploaded to the linear move control panel and irrigation was applied when needed nitrogen was applied in the form of urea ammonium nitrate uan 32 0 0 using fixed rate fertigation frf variable rate fertigation vrf and pre plant nitrogen pp application methods for the pp treatment 246 kg ha 1 of nitrogen was applied in 2015 2016 and 2017 table 1 in vrf and frf treatments in season fertilizer was applied fertigation using linear move sprinkler system the nitrogen fertilizer rate for vrf plots was calculated using the nitrogen recommendation equation proposed by the university of nebraska lincoln fertilizer guidelines shapiro et al 2008 this fertilizer requirement equation for maize was based on the expected yield soil organic matter and soil nitrate nitrogen content the nitrogen requirements for vrf plots for each year based on this procedure are presented in table 3 each vrf plot received different n amount based on the soil analysis the decline in the n rate from 2015 to 2017 could be attributed to the residual nitrate n left from the previous year a constant rate of 246 kg ha 1 of nitrogen fertilizer was applied to all frf plots in all three years since multiple applications of nitrogen are generally more efficient than single large doses due to nitrogen loss potential the n fertilizer application was divided in two applications in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons half of the required nitrogen was applied at the v2 stage of maize plant growth and the remaining amount was applied at v8 stage for both vrf and frf plots in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons in the 2015 growing season two applications which were several days apart were applied to the frf plots whereas only one application was done for vrf plots table 1 2 4 evapotranspiration calculations and statistical analysis crop evapotranspiration etc mm was calculated from a soil water balance equation eq 1 for the vegetative growth period emergence to tasseling and reproductive growth period silking to maturity 1 et c p i u runoff δ sws dp where p is precipitation mm i is irrigation mm u is upward water flux mm runoff is surface runoff from individual treatments mm δsws is change in soil water storage mm in the soil profile between the beginning and end of the growth period and dp is the deep percolation from the crop root zone mm since the water table is approximately 30 m below the surface upward water flux was assumed to be negligible irmak 2015a b the surface runoff was estimated using the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs formerly called as the soil conservation service scs curve number procedure usda nrcs 1985 the runoff was determined for each day over the growing seasons and then summed up for individual treatment for the vegetative period and reproductive period deep percolation was estimated using the daily soil water balance computer program payero et al 2009 bryant et al 1992 djaman and irmak 2012 irmak 2015a b the dates corresponding to observed vegetative period and reproductive period in three growing seasons are shown in table 4 the aw and etc data were statistically analyzed using proc glimmix procedure in sas sas institute inc cary nc usa to compare the effects of irrigation treatment nitrogen treatment and soil type on aw and etc the means were separated using least significant difference lsd test at the 95 level of significance to identify any potential significant differences in aw and etc between treatments when no significant interactions occurred between the treatments main effects were evaluated since the ni and pp combination was not studied in this research the ni level was excluded from the statistical model to complete the factorial design 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions a summary of weather data for three growing seasons 2015 2016 and 2017 along with long term average values is presented in table 5 the weather data were obtained from the high plains regional climatic center automated weather data network hprcc awdn near clay center ne the weather station was located only 800 m from the research field the growing season precipitation in 2015 2016 and 2017 was 353 375 and 467 mm respectively although the total growing season precipitation in 2015 was lower than 2016 and 2017 the 2015 season experienced very heavy rainfall in june 226 mm which was 131 mm greater than long term average table 5 which also explain the low irrigation amount required in 2015 a total of 1 7 and 10 irrigations were applied to fri plots in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively on average the 2015 growing season was warmer than 2016 and 2017 with the mean air temperature in 2015 of 20 3 c and 19 8 c and 19 1 c in 2016 and 2017 respectively the highest monthly average temperature in all three years occurred in july table 5 warmer temperatures in 2015 progressed the crop development hence the physiological maturity there were large differences in the cumulative growing degree days cgdd from planting to harvest between 2015 and 2016 and 2017 maize was harvested at 145 days after planting dap at cgdd of 1640 in 2015 whereas in 2016 and 2017 it was harvested at 160 dap cgdd of 1781 and 173 dap cgdd of 1783 respectively temporal patterns of daily average wind speed relative humidity rh vapor pressure deficit vpd incoming shortwave radiation and maximum and minimum air temperatures for 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons are shown in fig 2 evaporation losses from the surface and water used by plant transpiration are heavily influenced by these climatic variables on average wind speeds were greater in 2016 than in 2015 and 2017 also greater wind speeds were observed in the early growing season in all three years may to june which is common for the area the 2017 growing season experienced below normal wind speeds in the late growing season august and september because of minimal precipitation amounts in june in the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons as compared with 2015 large differences in rh were observed the monthly average rh in june was 75 60 and 61 for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively as compared with the long term average of 68 5 the incoming solar radiation was on average greater in 2017 than in 2015 and 2016 one of the driving forces of plant water use is the difference in vapor pressure between crop surface and surrounding atmosphere which is called vpd the temporal patterns of vpd for three growing seasons are presented in fig 2c on average vpd in 2017 growing season was greater than in 2015 and 2016 growing seasons 3 2 spatial distribution of soil properties the spatial distribution of sand silt and clay content in 0 0 30 0 30 0 60 0 60 0 90 0 90 1 20 and 1 20 1 50 m soil depths for each soil type are shown in fig 3a c respectively the measured and interpolated sand fraction in the research field ranged from 15 to 57 silt fraction ranged from 20 to 74 and clay fraction ranged from 7 to 39 the measured silt fraction was highly and negatively correlated with measured sand fraction with correlation coefficient of 0 85 0 84 0 76 0 89 and 0 95 for 0 0 30 0 30 0 60 0 60 0 90 0 90 1 20 and 1 20 1 50 m soil depths respectively the spatial distribution of other soil physical properties including omc bd ec fc and pwp are shown in figs 4a c and 5a and b respectively the interpolated omc ranged from 0 8 to 3 5 with the highest omc being in the top two soil layers 0 0 30 and 0 30 0 60 m omc in soil layers from 0 90 to 1 5 m ranged from 0 8 to 6 with very small variation among soil types fig 4a the bd values ranged from 1 02 to 1 32 g cm 3 with highest values in 1 50 m soil layer fig 4b there is large variation in ec values at the research site varying from 38 to 168 ms m 1 the highest ec values were observed in the 1 50 m soil layer fig 4c for accurate site specific irrigation management two of the most important factors to have data and information about is the site specific fc and pwp values large variation was observed in fc and pwp at the research site between the soil types as well as between the soil depths in a given soil type the range in fc and pwp was 26 43 and 11 5 30 respectively fig 5 and b the soil water holding capacity swhc for each soil layer was computed as the difference between soil water at fc and pwp which ranged from 20 to 93 mm 0 30 m soil depth for different layers fig 5c the soil physical properties at each soil depth and in each soil type are presented in table 6 in all three soil types the minimum silt content and maximum clay content was found at 0 30 0 60 m soil depth bulk density and ec showed an increasing trend with soil depth from 0 to 1 20 m whereas omc showed a decreasing trend with depth table 6 the ec of s1 was significantly lower than s3 and ec of s2 was not significantly different from other two soil types for all soil depths the highest ec was observed in s2 and the lowest was observed in s1 the fc of s3 was significantly lower than s1 and s2 whereas no difference was observed in pwp among soil types the greater variability in fc than pwp among different soil types might be due to the fact that fc is a function of various soil characteristics that vary more than those variables that impact pwp such as soil texture and structure type and content of clay omc water table depth of wetting presence of impeding layers and other factors kirkham 2014 whereas pwp is more of a function of a combination of plant soil and atmospheric factors tolk 2003 the swhc of s1 was also significantly greater than s3 table 6 for all three soil types swhc first decreased from 0 to 0 30 m and then generally increased with depth due to a presence of a layer with a high clay content in the 0 20 0 60 m soil layer djaman and irmak 2012 the soil particle size distribution at each depth in three soil types is presented on soil textural triangles fig 6 to understand the differences that may exist in soil texture which can impact irrigation and n requirements and management crop yields and water use in 0 0 30 m soil depth fig 6a in s1 red dots the soil texture is mostly the combination of sandy loam loam and silt loam whereas most of the s2 black dots is silt loam and loam and s3 yellow dots is generally a combination of loam silt loam and silty clay loam for 0 30 0 60 m soil layer fig 6b 90 of s1 has clay loam texture whereas approximately 90 of s2 and s3 are a mixture of clay loam and silty clay loam the 0 60 0 90 m of soil layers in all soil types are 90 loam and silt loam fig 6c in the 0 90 1 20 m soil layer s3 was 100 silt loam whereas s1 and s2 had a combination of loam and silt loam fig 6d fig 6e represents the soil textural distribution for the last soil layer i e 1 20 1 50 m in this layer s3 consists of a small portion of sandy loam and loam whereas most of the soil is silt loam s1 and s2 have most of the area under silt loam with some portions having loam from soil textural analysis of each layer under three different soil types it was observed that s3 has considerable textural differences from s1 and s2 3 3 treatment effects on soil moisture and available water dynamics available water aw in the 1 20 m soil profile in various nitrogen treatments under fri vri and ni treatments for three soil types in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons are presented in figs 7 9 respectively typical for the research field the soil profile was at or above full level above or close to fc at the beginning of the growing season in all three years figs 7 9 the initial soil water content in the 2015 growing season for all treatments and soil types was greater than the initial soil water content in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons and greater than the fc due to the greater spring precipitation in 2015 this was also one of the major reasons for late planting in 2015 as compared with 2016 ce 2017 growing seasons in the 2015 growing season due to greater precipitation at the beginning of the growing season table 5 and more uniform distribution of rainfall throughout the growing season the availability of soil water in the root zone was not affected considerably by the type of irrigation and nitrogen applications during this season the total precipitation was 353 mm and total irrigation amount for fri and vri plots on average was 25 4 and 15 2 mm respectively for s1 25 4 and 24 6 mm respectively for s2 and 25 4 and 30 1 mm respectively for s3 thus in comparison to precipitation which was distributed equally in all plots and soil types irrigation amounts were less and in general the differences in soil water patterns in all treatments including ni were similar the aw remained above mad 40 50 taw for all treatments including ni throughout the growing season indicating no crop water stress figs 7 9 except for ni treatment at vrf level in s3 fig 7i the aw started approaching mad around august 17 r2 growth stage and september 1 r3 growth stage coinciding with the periods of minimal precipitation since no irrigation was applied before the r3 growth stage 1 september the differences in soil moisture dynamics prior to the irrigation application between 17 august and 1 september were due to n fertilizer application type and rate significant interaction effect p 0 05 of irrigation and nitrogen treatment on average aw in 1 20 m soil profile was observed in 2015 in reproductive period under fri average aw in vrf and frf treatments was significantly greater p 0 05 than pp treatment whereas under vri average aw in vrf and pp treatment was significantly greater p 0 05 than frf though the amount of nitrogen in both pp and frf was same lower aw could be due to higher plant water uptake and deeper roots in those treatments lenka et al 2009 benbi 1989 the decline in aw after september 16 2015 in all irrigated treatments fig 7a f was due to lack of precipitation toward the end of the growing season as well as no irrigation application the irrigation was not applied after the r4 growth stage because there was enough water in the soil profile to meet the crop water requirements until physiological maturity greater differences in soil water fluctuations and depletion among irrigation and nitrogen treatments were observed in 2016 and 2017 than in 2015 growing season this could mainly be due to very low precipitation of 5 mm and 23 mm in the month of june in 2016 and 2017 respectively as compared with 226 mm in june of 2015 a total of 7 irrigations were applied to fri plots in 2016 and 10 in 2017 the total growing season precipitation was 375 mm and 463 mm and the total irrigation amount for fri was 191 mm and 254 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively though for each vri plot irrigation timing and amounts were different and on average the total irrigation amount for vri was 136 mm and 116 mm for 2016 and 2017 respectively the timing and amount of irrigation for vri plots is presented in table 2 in 2016 out of 7 irrigation events in fri treatment 6 irrigations occurred from july 15 to august 24 v16 to r4 growth stage which was the most active soil water extraction period and the most sensitive stages to water stress due to only 37 mm precipitation in this period the effect of amount and type of irrigation management fri vs vri was most prominent in this period the greatest soil water depletion from july 2 to august 28 i e the higher crop water uptake period for maize growth due to high atmospheric evaporative demand was observed in ni treatment 73 mm followed by vri 54 mm and fri 50 mm similarly for 2017 growing season for all treatments the greatest soil water depletion occurred from june 12 to september 13 v6 to r5 growth stage period on average the greatest water depletion in this period was in ni treatment 102 mm followed by vri 67 mm and fri 47 mm similar results were obtained by djaman et al 2013 and irmak 2015a b where full irrigation treatment showed lower soil water depletion as compared with limited irrigation treatments and rainfed condition overall the aw between vri and fri treatments demonstrated little or no difference regardless of the timing and amount of irrigation however in the vri treatment at all levels of nitrogen and soil type soil water was depleted below mad on several occasions when crop water demand was high whereas when fri of 25 4 mm was applied soil water always remained within the allowable limit this shows that irrigation timing and amount decisions based on site specific soil moisture measurement sometimes delays the irrigation because of which applied amount of irrigation may not be able to keep up with the crop water uptake bucks et al 1988 this could be due to the reason that irrigation scheduling based on soil water status considers only the changes in bulk soil water content and does not account for changes in water status in the plant tissues the actual tissue water is not only dependent on soil water status alone but also on the rate of water flow through the plant and corresponding hydraulic flow resistances between plant tissues and soil therefore in many cases plant response to soil water varies as a function of evaporative demand jones 2004 to understand how various irrigation and nitrogen treatments affect water uptake at different depths and growth stages average aw of three growing seasons at the vegetative and reproductive growth stages were also analyzed separately and are presented in tables 7 and 9 respectively since irrigation was initiated after or at the end of vegetative growth period table 7 shows only the effect of nitrogen treatment on aw in different soil types during the vegetative period effect of nitrogen treatment and interaction of soil type and nitrogen treatment was statistically insignificant p 0 05 at all depths in all soil types thus table 7 shows only statistical difference between soil types soil type main effect during this period the minimum aw or maximum soil water depletion was observed near the soil surface 0 0 30 m in all treatments and growing seasons due to high surface evaporation losses during the reproductive growth period minimum aw or maximum depletion was observed in both 0 0 30 m and 0 60 0 90 m soil depths due to plant water uptake as roots has progressed to 0 90 m depth coupled with evaporative losses from the surface in both vegetative and reproductive periods maximum aw i e minimum depletion was observed at either 0 30 0 60 m soil depth or below 0 90 m soil depth the reason behind high aw in 0 30 0 60 m soil profile is the presence of high clay content layer argillic layer at 0 30 0 60 m depth fig 3c this resulted in high aw and consequently insufficient aeration thus low plant water uptake similar results were observed by djaman and irmak 2012 at the same location they indicated around 51 of soil water extraction from 0 to 0 30 m soil profile and only 10 from 0 30 to 0 60 high aw below 0 90 m can be attributed to low root density at that depth thus less plant water uptake during the vegetative growth period no significant effect p 0 05 of any treatment irrigation and nitrogen and soil type on aw was observed at 0 0 30 m and 0 60 1 2 m soil depths however significant effect p 0 05 of soil type on aw was observed at 0 30 0 60 m clay layer at 0 30 0 60 m depth the aw in s1 was significantly greater p 0 05 than s2 whereas s3 was not significantly different p 0 05 from either s1 or s2 table 7 and can be attributed to significantly greater swhc in 0 30 0 60 m soil profile in s1 table 6 in the reproductive period effect of nitrogen and irrigation treatment on aw at each depth in each soil type was analyzed separately in this period no significant effect p 0 05 of irrigation and nitrogen treatment and their interaction was observed on aw in s2 and s3 at any depth however in s1 significant effect of irrigation and nitrogen treatments and their interaction existed except at 0 30 0 60 m soil depth tables 8 and 9 in s2 and s3 even though the amount of irrigation in vri was lower than fri no significant difference in aw between vri and fri showed that excess water in fri treatment was either lost to deep percolation and runoff or translated to etc in s1 there was a significant main effect of nitrogen treatment at 0 0 30 m significant main effect of irrigation and nitrogen at 0 60 0 90 and significant interaction effect of irrigation and nitrogen at 0 90 1 2 m soil depth on aw table 9 in general there was a lower aw under vri treatment than in fri the possible explanation is that the frequent irrigations in the fri treatment helped with frequent replenishment of water which prevented cyclical water stress that can occur with longer irrigation intervals as in vri treatment even if the total amount of seasonal irrigation is the same bucks et al 1988 radin et al 1989 comparing nitrogen treatments significantly lower aw in pp treatment as compared with vrf at 0 0 30 m and as compared to vrf and frf at 0 60 0 90 m was observed under fri in s1 table 9 in general in s1 lowest aw was observed in either pp or frf even though the nitrogen amount in both frf and pp treatment was same and was greater than vrf it can be suggested that higher rates of nitrogen 246 kg ha 1 can have higher soil water extraction due to deeper roots in those treatments lenka et al 2009 benbi 1989 no trend of nitrogen application on aw was observed in s2 and s3 overall results indicated that effect of irrigation and nitrogen application on aw was significant only in s1 whereas no significant effect of any treatment was observed in s2 and s3 the difference in effect of treatments on aw between soils could be related to the elevation and slope in that soil type which determines the flow and accumulation of soil water in different positions of the landscape ruffo et al 2006 kanwar et al 1988 lower elevation and higher slopes in s2 and s3 could have resulted in poor conditions for plant growth excessive water for prolonged period in the root zone in all treatments 3 4 treatment effects on maize evapotranspiration during vegetative and reproductive period to understand how different irrigation and nitrogen treatments in different soil types affect plant water use etc between frf vrf and pp nitrogen treatments under fri and vri in three soil types were compared in maize vegetative and reproductive growth periods tables 10 12 in 2015 no irrigation was applied whereas only 1 irrigation was applied in 2016 in the vegetative period in 2017 more irrigations were applied in the vegetative period as compared to 2015 and 2016 due to higher crop water demand that can be attribute to higher incoming solar radiation and higher vpd in vegetative period of 2017 table 5 on average 76 2 mm of irrigation in fri and 26 17 and 0 mm of irrigation in vri in s1 s2 and s3 respectively was applied in 2017 table 2 because of no to very little irrigation in vegetative period of 2015 and 2016 any difference in etc in 2015 and 2016 among treatments during vegetative period were due to soil type or nitrogen treatment or their interaction table 10 in 2015 vegetative etc in s3 was 15 and 14 mm greater than etc in s1 and s2 respectively the greater vegetative etc in s3 was most likely due to greater surface evaporation due to incomplete canopy cover lai 2 sharma and irmak 2020 the sparse crop leaf canopy lai 2 can result in considerable surface evaporation as compared with full canopy cover ogola et al 2002 the effect of nitrogen treatments on etc was also significant p 0 05 in 2015 with 9 and 10 mm greater etc in pp nitrogen treatment as compared with frf and vrf respectively table 11 in 2016 the effect of interaction of soil and nitrogen treatment on etc was significant p 0 05 table 10 no statistical impact of irrigation treatments on vegetative etc was observed in 2016 which indicates that there was enough soil water in the root zone to meet the crop water requirements in the plots where no irrigation was applied in the vegetative period as compared to the plots where irrigation was applied table 2 the etc in pp nitrogen treatment was 54 mm greater than frf in s1 whereas no significant difference between pp and frf existed in s2 and s3 p 0 05 the etc in frf was 43 mm greater than vrf in s2 whereas no significant difference occurred between frf and vrf in s1 and s3 p 0 05 comparing the vrf and pp nitrogen treatments no significant difference existed in any soil type in 2016 overall in 2016 greater etc was observed in s1 as compared with s2 and s3 the nitrogen treatments had a significant impact p 0 05 which could be attributed to soil type environmental conditions impact of soil type and environment on n mineralization and timing of nitrogen application rather than the amount further research is needed to assess the comprehensive impact of nitrogen fertilizer timing and soil chemical properties on vegetative etc in 2017 effect of irrigation and soil type on etc was significant p 0 05 however nitrogen treatment did not significantly impact etc table 10 the etc in fri treatment in 2017 was 47 mm greater than vri that can be attributed to higher irrigation amount in fri in that period as compared to vri also similar to 2016 s1 had significantly higher p 0 05 etc 244 mm than s2 179 mm and s3 198 mm in 2017 it could be argued that lower etc in s2 and s3 as compared with s1 was due to lower irrigation but in this research there was enough soil water in the root zone fig 9 to meet crop water requirements because of which no irrigation was recommended for some plots under vri it is likely that the greater aw and lower etc in those plots where no irrigation was recommended in s2 and s3 was due to the lower elevation sharma and irmak 2020 because of lower elevation soil pores were filled with water for an appreciable length of time that restricted the growth of roots thus impacted etc kanwar et al 1988 greater variability in etc among treatments was observed in reproductive period as compared with vegetative period due to the effects of soil type irrigation nitrogen and their interaction table 10 in 2015 no significant impact p 0 05 of any treatment and soil type was observed in reproductive period etc due to lower irrigation amounts in this season in 2016 significant effect of irrigation and nitrogen treatment existed on reproductive etc whereas interaction effect of soil and irrigation and soil and nitrogen treatment was significant p 0 05 in 2017 tables 10 and 12 in 2016 reproductive etc in fri was 53 mm greater than vri which could be attributed to 50 mm greater irrigation in fri in terms of nitrogen pp treatment has significantly higher p 0 05 etc as compared with frf which shows the timing of nitrogen application plays an important role in crop water uptake similar results were obtained in 2017 however significant interaction p 0 05 of irrigation and nitrogen with soil type was also observed in s1 etc under pp nitrogen treatment was significantly greater p 0 05 than vrf but no statistical difference was observed between pp and frf in s2 significant difference occurred between frf and vrf treatment whereas in s3 no significant difference between nitrogen treatments was observed in 2017 effect of irrigation treatment on reproductive etc was not significant in s1 whereas significantly higher etc under fri as compared with vri was observed in s2 and s3 table 12 this shows that amount and timing of irrigation had a direct impact on etc in s2 and s3 but not in s1 even though significant differences occurred in aw among different irrigation treatments at reproductive growth stage in s1 no difference in etc between vri and fri revealed that the lower aw in vri was due to higher plant water uptake as etc is directly correlated to grain yield irmak 2015 it can be assumed that vri has a potential in maintaining the optimum grain yield by using less water as compared to fri in certain soil types like s1 however additional research is required to understand the potential benefits of vri and its impact on crop yield in terms of nitrogen since the nitrogen rates between the treatments were not different it would be hard to determine the impact of nitrogen rates on etc however from the pooled data as well as from the individual year it can be suggested that pp nitrogen treatment resulted in greater etc than other nitrogen treatments details about the impact of etc under different irrigation and nitrogen treatments on grain yield are presented in the companion paper by sharma and irmak 2020 4 conclusions soil water dynamics and maize etc during vegetative and reproductive growth periods for different irrigation and nitrogen application treatments in three soil types for maize was researched in the 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons in the irmak research laboratory in south central nebraska the irrigation treatment did not statistically impact etc during the vegetative period for the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons however the impact of irrigation on vegetative etc in 2017 was significant due to earlier initiation of irrigation in 2017 no effect of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer was observed on aw in the vegetative period and differences in the aw between treatments were mainly due to soil type the results indicate that vegetative period etc was primarily affected by soil type weather conditions evaporative demand and soil wetting and nitrogen fertilizer application timing in the reproductive growth period no significant effect p 0 05 of irrigation and nitrogen treatment and their interaction was observed on aw in s2 and s3 at any depth however in s1 significant effect of irrigation and nitrogen treatments and their interaction was observed except at 0 30 0 60 m soil depth these results indicate that soil type and topography play important role in determining the impact of irrigation and nitrogen on aw the effect of irrigation treatment on reproductive etc was not significant in s1 in 2017 whereas significantly higher etc under fri as compared with vri was observed in s2 and s3 the fact that significant differences occurred in aw among vri and fri at reproductive growth stage in s1 and no significant differences in etc between vri and fri were observed revealed that the lower aw in vri was due to higher plant water uptake and that excess irrigation water applied in fri treatment was either lost to deep percolation or runoff this indicated the potential benefit of vri in s1 significantly lower etc in vri as compared with fri in s2 and s3 in reproductive period in 2017 was likely due to restricted root growth due to excessive water in the root zone for prolonged period due to lower elevation depression in s2 and s3 these results show that irrigation scheduling based on soil water status only sometimes does not take into account the changes in water status in the plant and root tissues creating plant water stress even though enough water is available in soil profile in terms of nitrogen fertilizer effect the nitrogen rates between the treatments were not substantially different so it would be difficult to determine the impact of nitrogen rates however from the pooled data as well as from the individual year data it can be suggested that pp nitrogen treatment resulted in greater etc than other nitrogen treatments the results of this research indicated that soil water dynamics is a strong function of not only management practices irrigation and nitrogen treatments but is also a strong function of site specific soil water holding capacity and aw water in the same treatments under the same management varied by soil type results of this research can aid in better understanding the relationships between spatial soil properties in relation to fri and vri as well as frf vrf and pp management and developing more effective and relevant management options under different soil types declaration of competing interest

move sprinkler irrigation system no effect of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer on aw was observed in the vegetative period overall greater aw was observed in s3 as compared with s1 and s2 due to lower elevation maize etc during the vegetative period was significantly p 0 05 impacted by soil type in all three years and by nitrogen treatment in two of the three years the vegetative etc in s1 was 27 and 19 mm greater than s2 and s3 respectively for the pooled 2015 2016 and 2017 data during the reproductive period both etc and aw were impacted by nitrogen and irrigation treatments but differently in different soil types and years average reproductive etc for fri and vri in 2015 2016 and 2017 was 175 and 178 mm 294 and 241 mm 258 and 206 mm respectively averaged across three years

difference in reproductive etc was observed between vri and fri in s1 during reproductive period averaged across years soil types and irrigation treatments the pp nitrogen treatment had greater etc

the impact of these management practices on soil water dynamics and etc which can be used as a guidance keywords irrigation management nitrogen soil water variable rate management water use vegetative period reproductive period 1 introduction freshwater is a scarce resource and is essential for maintaining an adequate food supply and living environment for humans animal and plants because of increasing population demand for freshwater is becoming greater and is projected to increase more rapidly than the renewable supplies by 2025 postel et al 1996 around 60 of the global population may experience water scarcity by 2025 qadir et al 2007 according to the united nations estimation in order to meet the increasing population s food demands land under cultivation must increase by 40 and the amount of water allocated to irrigation must increase by 14 by 2030 thus there is a pressing need for significant changes and implementing effective approaches in agricultural water management to address the issue of water shortages and increase productivity efficient irrigation water management strategies for maximum water use efficiency are imperative for the sustainability of water resources and crop production two of the most important components in crop production are water and nitrogen and their adequate and timely supply during the growing season studies have reported the substantial influence of soil water availability on crop yield and evapotranspiration etc pandey et al 2000 payero et al 2009 djaman and irmak 2012 deficit soil water can significantly decrease crop yield as compared with adequate available soil water conditions zhang et al 2004 also excessive soil water can sometimes decrease crop yields significantly king et al 2006 irmak 2014 in traditional irrigation management it is usually assumed that the field under consideration is uniform it is a common practice to use a single mean value of crop response to water and etc for deciding water application timing and depth in this research this practice is referred to as uniform or fixed rate irrigation fri which is most practiced globally depending on numerous factors crop response to water can vary in space and time spatio temporal variability due to differences in plant emergence plant density soil water availability spatial soil characteristics field slope and other factors that affect crop growth and nutrient availability which thereby impacts crop yield and quality evans and king 2010 also uniform application of fertilizers fixed rate fertigation frf or pre plant pp nitrogen application can have negative environmental consequences such as pollution of surface and groundwater resources basso et al 2016 pierce and nowak 1999 because of excessive fertilizer application at locations in the field where it is not required coupled with untimely precipitation events and or poor irrigation management the realization and understanding of these challenges and advancements in precision agriculture technologies in the last several decades has also increased the interest in the concept of variable rate irrigation vri and variable rate fertigation vrf to manage spatial and temporal variabilities within agricultural fields evans et al 2013 robert 2002 vri is referred to as applying the right amount of water at the right time and at the right location in a given field it is an irrigation scheduling method based on site specific soil water holding capacity that should be measured determine using real time site specific soil moisture measurements development in the site specific water application technologies made it possible to vary both water and agricultural chemicals fertilizers and pesticides to meet specific needs of the crops in each unique zone within a field different aspects and effectiveness of vri technology using primarily self propelled center pivot or linear move irrigation systems have been studied by several researchers fraisse et al 1995 evans et al 1996 sadler et al 1996 king et al 1999 2009 king and kincaid 2004 han et al 2009 chávez et al 2010a b however most of these researches focused on the development and improvement of hardware and software to implement site specific technology on irrigation systems and to achieve precision in applying water and other chemicals spatially in the field limited studies have been conducted to evaluate the potential benefits of vri in regards to water conservation and impact of vri on the soil water plant relationship soil water dynamics and etc al kufaishi et al 2006 investigated the feasibility of using vri on a 7 ha field with sugar beet in germany using a daily soil water balance simulation model irrigation applications of 20 30 and 40 mm were simulated and management zones were created based on available soil water holding capacity the loss of water was higher for the uniform application scenarios than that for the vri scenarios for the applications of 20 and 30 mm they observed that vri scenario of 20 mm water application was the best option for water conservation hedley and yule 2009 compared vri and uniform irrigation scenarios for three years of climate data on a 156 ha pasture and 53 ha maize field in new zealand the management zones for vri were delineated by relating apparent electrical conductivity with available soil water holding capacity a soil water balance model was used on a daily basis for simulations of irrigation needs the vri scenarios saved 23 26 of irrigation water as compared with uniform irrigation the same model was used by hedley et al 2009 on 40 ha pasture 24 ha potato and 22 ha maize sites in new zealand to evaluate irrigation water use drainage water use nitrogen leaching and other parameters between vri and uniform irrigation scenarios they reported an annual water use reduction of 9 19 under vri as compared with uniform irrigation however in all these studies soil moisture was simulated using models rather than measured data for specific fields and for different sites locations within a field the impact of irrigation scheduling amount and timing based on real or near real time soil moisture measurements on plant water uptake and growth has not been studied sufficiency through field experiments it is not well known if addressing the assumed spatial variations in the field in terms soil properties e g soil texture soil water holding capacity etc will result in water conservation or not while a limited number of studies suggested that there may be a water conservation advantage to vri numerous studies suggested otherwise and the adoption of vri technology has been extremely limited in large scale production fields evans and king 2012 stated that 20 years of private and public research on site specific irrigation has resulted in very limited commercial adoption of the technology they also stated that the primary reason for the very low rate of commercial adoption appears to be the absence of a market for the technology and a low rate of return documented and proven water conservation strategies using vri for crop production are quite limited and its cost effectiveness has not been demonstrated furthermore they suggested that there is very little scientific information documenting the capability of site specific sprinkler irrigation systems to conserve water or energy on a field scale for crop production in either arid or humid environments in addition the hydrologic conditions of reported studies were usually not widespread enough to be able to denote large scale water savings however the vri technology has been evolving and effectiveness robustness and associated benefits have the potential to improve over time through scientific research and development in many regions the lack of plant available soil water generally has the predominant adverse effect on yield understanding the impact of delaying irrigation until a set soil moisture threshold management allowable depletion is reached using soil moisture sensors on soil water dynamics and plant water uptake at different nitrogen levels is critical radin et al 1989 showed an increase in cotton yield when interval between water applications decreased it has been observed that under longer irrigation cycles plants get stressed at the end of the irrigation cycle however frequent irrigations could alleviate this stress allowing the crop to reach its production potential bucks et al 1988 in addition site specific characteristics such as slope and topography interact with nitrogen fertilizer ruffo et al 2006 indicates that terrain attributes as soil water content affect corn yield and its response to nitrogen fertilizer zhou et al 2011 found no significant effect of nitrogen fertilizer rate over 120 kg n ha 1 on soil water storage and corn grain yield in a six year study in shaanxi province china in general plant water uptake is also strongly correlated to root distribution proffitt et al 1985 which has been found to depend on type of irrigation nitrogen fertilizer and availability of soil water phene et al 1991 the first step in understanding the impacts of variable rate application of water and fertilizer on crop response is understanding the variability in soil properties that exist in the field and how these natural variabilities affect the overall dynamics of soil water the knowledge about variability that exists in the soil within a field is fundamental to the development of effective site specific or variable rate management because different soils have different water holding capacities han et al 1996 that impact plant growth development and yield vs water dynamics and et differently soil water dynamics has not been studied in a system that couples vri technology with variable rate fertigation in different soil types simultaneously the objectives of this research were to i to quantify the horizontal and vertical variability in soil properties for three soil types in the same research field so that their influence s can be quantified and accounted for in any potential variation in soil water dynamics and ii evaluate how various nitrogen fertilizer management practices frf vrf and pp under various irrigation management practices vri fri and no irrigation ni affect seasonal soil water trends and cumulative etc at different growth stages of maize quantifying and analyzing such variabilities can provide important information data and guidance to further enhance the effectiveness of variable water and nitrogen management strategies in fields with spatially variability 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and soil sampling this project is part of a larger and ongoing long term project in the irmak research laboratory that also investigated seasonal etc production functions crop water productivity response and economics of maize soybean and sorghum production under vri fri and ni with vrf frf

enable the zones to deliver the desired application rates sprinkler spacing was 1 2 m and sprinklers were mounted on drop tubes at approximately 2 m above the ground level in april of each research year soil samples were collected from 42 locations within the experimental field fig 1 from each sampling location two soil samples per depth were collected at the soil depths of 0 0 30 0 30 0 60 0 60

ward laboratory kearney ne soil was sampled to determine the existing nitrogen conditions to determine soil fertilizer recommendations and irrigation management in variable rate management of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer a thorough analysis of soil properties is essential for various purposes including determining vri requirements for individual soil layers that have different soil properties rather than assuming a uniform soil layer for the entire crop root zone soils from all depths were analyzed for nitrate n for all three years however at the beginning of the experiment i e for the first soil sampling in april 2015 soil samples were analyzed for bulk density bd electrical conductivity ec organic matter content omc field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp and soil particle size distribution sand silt and clay the fc and pwp values were determined using pressure plate apparatus at 1 3 bar and 15 bar pressure respectively the soil particle size distribution was determined by hydrometer method blake and hartge 1986 since these values do not change in a short period i e three years of research duration same values for these soil properties were used in estimating site specific nitrogen and irrigation requirements for all three years in arcgis software ver 10 1 esri redlands california the inverse distance weighted interpolation method was used to model the spatial distribution of all soil physical properties in the research field 2 2 experimental details and cultural practices in each research year each soil type was divided into 27 plots

three levels of nitrogen fertilizer fixed rate fertilizer management frf variable rate fertilizer management vrf and pre plant n pp which makes a total 9 treatment combinations fig 1 treatments were randomly assigned to the plots in each growing season the treatment combination of ni and pp nitrogen management was not studied in this research instead ni and no nitrogen combination treatment was evaluated each plot was 6 m 6 m in size with a 6 m 6 m buffer plot on all four sides of each plot fig 1 the buffer plots were established to prevent eliminate sprinkler overlap between the plots sprinkler wetted diameter was 6 m cultural management practices operations for the three years and common practices including planting emergence and fertilizer applications tasseling and harvest dates are shown in table 1 the research field was managed as disk till maize seeds were planted in rows at a depth of 6 3 cm row spacing was 0 76 m and the planting population density was 84 500 plants ha

irrigation and nitrogen amounts were quantified and the details are discussed in the latter sections 2 3 soil moisture measurements irrigation management and nitrogen management irrigation timing and

systems were installed immediately following the crop emergence each year and were removed from the field at the end of each growing season for harvesting wgms were used to monitor smp kpa on an hourly basis which was then converted to volumetric soil water content using soil water retention curves for each soil type for the research site developed and presented in irmak 2019 and irmak et al 2012 2016 for different soil types at clay center ne and in other locations since there were differences in the soil textural properties depthwise in a vertical domain in addition to the horizontal domain for 2016 and 2017 growing seasons soil water retention curves based on soil texture at each soil depth were used in total there were six types of soils existed in the research field these soil

different depths at the same location has not been considered previously for vri and vrf management the volumetric soil water content vwc at each soil depth was then multiplied by the representative depth intervals to determine the total soil water stored sws in each depth and then summed up to obtain total soil water for the 0 1 20 m soil profile for each plot whenever the smp values at any soil depth was below 33 kpa which means soil was at or near field capacity it was adjusted to 33 kpa to prevent very high or erroneous vwc values the total available water taw was calculated by subtracting soil water at pwp from soil water at fc for each plot management allowable depletion mad for all plots was set to 40 of taw irrigation was triggered whenever total soil water stored in the effective rooting depth as represented by smp values was approaching to or below mad crops do not extract water uniformly from the entire root zone throughout the growing season effective rooting depth is the portion of the root zone from where the crop can extract water based on the rooting depth and growth stage of the crop the effective root zone depth for irrigation amount and timing was decided accordingly for each growing season the timing of irrigation for both vri and fri was decided in this manner however for fri plots the amount of irrigation was fixed to be 25 4 mm per irrigation application each time any of the fri plots needed irrigation all fri plots were irrigated with 25 4 mm depth of water considering no variability in the field and assuming that crop responds in the same manner at all locations in the field which is the most commonly used irrigation practice in nebraska and greater midwestern region a total of 1 7 and 10 irrigations were applied to fri plots in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively for vri plots irrigation amounts varied substantially and were applied to bring the soil water to approximately 85 of fc or to maintain 85 of taw to reserve some soil water deficit for any potential precipitation only those plots where soil moisture depletion was greater than mad were irrigated in any irrigation event for vri plots thus the number and amount of irrigation events for each vri plot was different the irrigation dates and amounts for each treatment are presented in table 2 for this research irrigation amounts and timing in each experimental plot was needed prior to irrigation to calculate the irrigation requirements for fri and vri plots to accomplish this the soil moisture sensor data were downloaded from each plot every other day and were uploaded to an irrigation scheduling worksheet that was developed in the irmak research laboratory for each plot based on the plot specific soil properties computed irrigation values were then used to develop water control prescription maps for delivering precise irrigation amount to each experimental unit the final map was then uploaded to the linear move control panel and irrigation was applied when needed nitrogen was applied in the form of urea ammonium nitrate uan 32 0 0 using fixed rate fertigation frf variable rate fertigation vrf and pre plant nitrogen pp application methods for the pp treatment 246 kg ha 1 of nitrogen was applied in 2015 2016 and 2017 table 1 in vrf and frf treatments in season fertilizer was applied fertigation using linear move sprinkler system the nitrogen fertilizer rate for vrf plots was calculated using the nitrogen recommendation equation proposed by the university of nebraska lincoln fertilizer guidelines shapiro et al 2008 this fertilizer requirement equation for maize was based on the expected yield soil organic matter and soil nitrate nitrogen content the nitrogen requirements for vrf plots for each year based on this procedure are presented in table 3 each vrf plot received different n amount based on the soil analysis the decline in the n rate from 2015 to 2017 could be attributed to the residual nitrate n left from the previous year a constant rate of 246 kg ha 1 of nitrogen fertilizer was applied to all frf plots in all three years since multiple applications of nitrogen are generally more efficient than single large doses due to nitrogen loss potential the n fertilizer application was divided in two applications in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons half of the required nitrogen was applied at the v2 stage of maize plant growth and the remaining amount was applied at v8 stage for both vrf and frf plots in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons in the 2015 growing season two applications which were several days apart were applied to the frf plots whereas only one application was done for vrf plots table 1 2 4 evapotranspiration calculations and statistical analysis crop evapotranspiration etc mm was calculated from a soil water balance equation eq 1 for the vegetative growth period emergence to tasseling and reproductive growth period silking to maturity 1 et c p i u runoff δ sws dp where p is precipitation mm i is irrigation mm u is upward water flux mm runoff is surface runoff from individual treatments mm δsws is change in soil water storage mm in the soil profile between the beginning and end of the growth period and dp is the deep percolation from the crop root zone mm since the water table is approximately 30 m below the surface upward water flux was assumed to be negligible irmak 2015a b the surface runoff was estimated using the usda natural resources conservation service nrcs formerly called as the soil conservation service scs curve number procedure usda nrcs 1985 the runoff was determined for each day over the growing seasons and then summed up for individual treatment for the vegetative period and reproductive period deep percolation was estimated using the daily soil water balance computer program payero et al 2009 bryant et al 1992 djaman and irmak 2012 irmak 2015a b the dates corresponding to observed vegetative period and reproductive period in three growing seasons are shown in table 4 the aw and etc data were statistically analyzed using proc glimmix procedure in sas sas institute inc cary nc usa to compare the effects of irrigation treatment nitrogen treatment and soil type on aw and etc the means were separated using least significant difference lsd test at the 95 level of significance to identify any potential significant differences in aw and etc between treatments when no significant interactions occurred between the treatments main effects were evaluated since the ni and pp combination was not studied in this research the ni level was excluded from the statistical model to complete the factorial design 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions a summary of weather data for three growing seasons 2015 2016 and 2017 along with long term average values is presented in table 5 the weather data were obtained from the high plains regional climatic center automated weather data network hprcc awdn near clay center ne the weather station was located only 800 m from the research field the growing season precipitation in 2015 2016 and 2017 was 353 375 and 467 mm respectively although the total growing season precipitation in 2015 was lower than 2016 and 2017 the 2015 season experienced very heavy rainfall in june 226 mm which was 131 mm greater than long term average table 5 which also explain the low irrigation amount required in 2015 a total of 1 7 and 10 irrigations were applied to fri plots in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons respectively on average the 2015 growing season was warmer than 2016 and 2017 with the mean air temperature in 2015 of 20 3 c and 19 8 c and 19 1 c in 2016 and 2017 respectively the highest monthly average temperature in all three years occurred in july table 5 warmer temperatures in 2015 progressed the crop development hence the physiological maturity there were large differences in the cumulative growing degree days cgdd from planting to harvest between 2015 and 2016 and 2017 maize was harvested at 145 days after planting dap at cgdd of 1640 in 2015 whereas in 2016 and 2017 it was harvested at 160 dap cgdd of 1781 and 173 dap cgdd of 1783 respectively temporal patterns of daily average wind speed relative humidity rh vapor pressure deficit vpd incoming shortwave radiation and maximum and minimum air temperatures for 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons are shown in fig 2 evaporation losses from the surface and water used by plant transpiration are heavily influenced by these climatic variables on average wind speeds were greater in 2016 than in 2015 and 2017 also greater wind speeds were observed in the early growing season in all three years may to june which is common for the area the 2017 growing season experienced below normal wind speeds in the late growing season august and september because of minimal precipitation amounts in june in the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons as compared with 2015 large differences in rh were observed the monthly average rh in june was 75 60 and 61 for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively as compared with the long term average of 68 5 the incoming solar radiation was on average greater in 2017 than in 2015 and 2016 one of the driving forces of plant water use is the difference in vapor pressure between crop surface and surrounding atmosphere which is called vpd the temporal patterns of vpd for three growing seasons are presented in fig 2c on average vpd in 2017 growing season was greater than in 2015 and 2016 growing seasons 3 2 spatial distribution of soil properties the spatial distribution of sand silt and clay content in 0 0 30 0 30 0 60 0 60 0 90 0 90 1 20 and 1 20 1 50 m soil depths for each soil type are shown in fig 3a c respectively the measured and interpolated sand fraction in the research field ranged from 15 to 57 silt fraction ranged from 20 to 74 and clay fraction ranged from 7 to 39 the measured silt fraction was highly and negatively correlated with measured sand fraction with correlation coefficient of 0 85 0 84 0 76 0 89 and 0 95 for 0 0 30 0 30 0 60 0 60 0 90 0 90 1 20 and 1 20 1 50 m soil depths respectively the spatial distribution of other soil physical properties including omc bd ec fc and pwp are shown in figs 4a c and 5a and b respectively the interpolated omc ranged from 0 8 to 3 5 with the highest omc being in the top two soil layers 0 0 30 and 0 30 0 60 m omc in soil layers from 0 90 to 1 5 m ranged from 0 8 to 6 with very small variation among soil types fig 4a the bd values ranged from 1 02 to 1 32 g cm 3 with highest values in 1 50 m soil layer fig 4b there is large variation in ec values at the research site varying from 38 to 168 ms m 1 the highest ec values were observed in the 1 50 m soil layer fig 4c for accurate site specific irrigation management two of the most important factors to have data and information about is the site specific fc and pwp values large variation was observed in fc and pwp at the research site between the soil types as well as between the soil depths in a given soil type the range in fc and pwp was 26 43 and 11 5 30 respectively fig 5 and b the soil water holding capacity swhc for each soil layer was computed as the difference between soil water at fc and pwp which ranged from 20 to 93 mm 0 30 m soil depth for different layers fig 5c the soil physical properties at each soil depth and in each soil type are presented in table 6 in all three soil types the minimum silt content and maximum clay content was found at 0 30 0 60 m soil depth bulk density and ec showed an increasing trend with soil depth from 0 to 1 20 m whereas omc showed a decreasing trend with depth table 6 the ec of s1 was significantly lower than s3 and ec of s2 was not significantly different from other two soil types for all soil depths the highest ec was observed in s2 and the lowest was observed in s1 the fc of s3 was significantly lower than s1 and s2 whereas no difference was observed in pwp among soil types the greater variability in fc than pwp among different soil types might be due to the fact that fc is a function of various soil characteristics that vary more than those variables that impact pwp such as soil texture and structure type and content of clay omc water table depth of wetting presence of impeding layers and other factors kirkham 2014 whereas pwp is more of a function of a combination of plant soil and atmospheric factors tolk 2003 the swhc of s1 was also significantly greater than s3 table 6 for all three soil types swhc first decreased from 0 to 0 30 m and then generally increased with depth due to a presence of a layer with a high clay content in the 0 20 0 60 m soil layer djaman and irmak 2012 the soil particle size distribution at each depth in three soil types is presented on soil textural triangles fig 6 to understand the differences that may exist in soil texture which can impact irrigation and n requirements and management crop yields and water use in 0 0 30 m soil depth fig 6a in s1 red dots the soil texture is mostly the combination of sandy loam loam and silt loam whereas most of the s2 black dots is silt loam and loam and s3 yellow dots is generally a combination of loam silt loam and silty clay loam for 0 30 0 60 m soil layer fig 6b 90 of s1 has clay loam texture whereas approximately 90 of s2 and s3 are a mixture of clay loam and silty clay loam the 0 60 0 90 m of soil layers in all soil types are 90 loam and silt loam fig 6c in the 0 90 1 20 m soil layer s3 was 100 silt loam whereas s1 and s2 had a combination of loam and silt loam fig 6d fig 6e represents the soil textural distribution for the last soil layer i e 1 20 1 50 m in this layer s3 consists of a small portion of sandy loam and loam whereas most of the soil is silt loam s1 and s2 have most of the area under silt loam with some portions having loam from soil textural analysis of each layer under three different soil types it was observed that s3 has considerable textural differences from s1 and s2 3 3 treatment effects on soil moisture and available water dynamics available water aw in the 1 20 m soil profile in various nitrogen treatments under fri vri and ni treatments for three soil types in 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons are presented in figs 7 9 respectively typical for the research field the soil profile was at or above full level above or close to fc at the beginning of the growing season in all three years figs 7 9 the initial soil water content in the 2015 growing season for all treatments and soil types was greater than the initial soil water content in 2016 and 2017 growing seasons and greater than the fc due to the greater spring precipitation in 2015 this was also one of the major reasons for late planting in 2015 as compared with 2016 ce 2017 growing seasons in the 2015 growing season due to greater precipitation at the beginning of the growing season table 5 and more uniform distribution of rainfall throughout the growing season the availability of soil water in the root zone was not affected considerably by the type of irrigation and nitrogen applications during this season the total precipitation was 353 mm and total irrigation amount for fri and vri plots on average was 25 4 and 15 2 mm respectively for s1 25 4 and 24 6 mm respectively for s2 and 25 4 and 30 1 mm respectively for s3 thus in comparison to precipitation which was distributed equally in all plots and soil types irrigation amounts were less and in general the differences in soil water patterns in all treatments including ni were similar the aw remained above mad 40 50 taw for all treatments including ni throughout the growing season indicating no crop water stress figs 7 9 except for ni treatment at vrf level in s3 fig 7i the aw started approaching mad around august 17 r2 growth stage and september 1 r3 growth stage coinciding with the periods of minimal precipitation since no irrigation was applied before the r3 growth stage 1 september the differences in soil moisture dynamics prior to the irrigation application between 17 august and 1 september were due to n fertilizer application type and rate significant interaction effect p 0 05 of irrigation and nitrogen treatment on average aw in 1 20 m soil profile was observed in 2015 in reproductive period under fri average aw in vrf and frf treatments was significantly greater p 0 05 than pp treatment whereas under vri average aw in vrf and pp treatment was significantly greater p 0 05 than frf though the amount of nitrogen in both pp and frf was same lower aw could be due to higher plant water uptake and deeper roots in those treatments lenka et al 2009 benbi 1989 the decline in aw after september 16 2015 in all irrigated treatments fig 7a f was due to lack of precipitation toward the end of the growing season as well as no irrigation application the irrigation was not applied after the r4 growth stage because there was enough water in the soil profile to meet the crop water requirements until physiological maturity greater differences in soil water fluctuations and depletion among irrigation and nitrogen treatments were observed in 2016 and 2017 than in 2015 growing season this could mainly be due to very low precipitation of 5 mm and 23 mm in the month of june in 2016 and 2017 respectively as compared with 226 mm in june of 2015 a total of 7 irrigations were applied to fri plots in 2016 and 10 in 2017 the total growing season precipitation was 375 mm and 463 mm and the total irrigation amount for fri was 191 mm and 254 mm in 2016 and 2017 respectively though for each vri plot irrigation timing and amounts were different and on average the total irrigation amount for vri was 136 mm and 116 mm for 2016 and 2017 respectively the timing and amount of irrigation for vri plots is presented in table 2 in 2016 out of 7 irrigation events in fri treatment 6 irrigations occurred from july 15 to august 24 v16 to r4 growth stage which was the most active soil water extraction period and the most sensitive stages to water stress due to only 37 mm precipitation in this period the effect of amount and type of irrigation management fri vs vri was most prominent in this period the greatest soil water depletion from july 2 to august 28 i e the higher crop water uptake period for maize growth due to high atmospheric evaporative demand was observed in ni treatment 73 mm followed by vri 54 mm and fri 50 mm similarly for 2017 growing season for all treatments the greatest soil water depletion occurred from june 12 to september 13 v6 to r5 growth stage period on average the greatest water depletion in this period was in ni treatment 102 mm followed by vri 67 mm and fri 47 mm similar results were obtained by djaman et al 2013 and irmak 2015a b where full irrigation treatment showed lower soil water depletion as compared with limited irrigation treatments and rainfed condition overall the aw between vri and fri treatments demonstrated little or no difference regardless of the timing and amount of irrigation however in the vri treatment at all levels of nitrogen and soil type soil water was depleted below mad on several occasions when crop water demand was high whereas when fri of 25 4 mm was applied soil water always remained within the allowable limit this shows that irrigation timing and amount decisions based on site specific soil moisture measurement sometimes delays the irrigation because of which applied amount of irrigation may not be able to keep up with the crop water uptake bucks et al 1988 this could be due to the reason that irrigation scheduling based on soil water status considers only the changes in bulk soil water content and does not account for changes in water status in the plant tissues the actual tissue water is not only dependent on soil water status alone but also on the rate of water flow through the plant and corresponding hydraulic flow resistances between plant tissues and soil therefore in many cases plant response to soil water varies as a function of evaporative demand jones 2004 to understand how various irrigation and nitrogen treatments affect water uptake at different depths and growth stages average aw of three growing seasons at the vegetative and reproductive growth stages were also analyzed separately and are presented in tables 7 and 9 respectively since irrigation was initiated after or at the end of vegetative growth period table 7 shows only the effect of nitrogen treatment on aw in different soil types during the vegetative period effect of nitrogen treatment and interaction of soil type and nitrogen treatment was statistically insignificant p 0 05 at all depths in all soil types thus table 7 shows only statistical difference between soil types soil type main effect during this period the minimum aw or maximum soil water depletion was observed near the soil surface 0 0 30 m in all treatments and growing seasons due to high surface evaporation losses during the reproductive growth period minimum aw or maximum depletion was observed in both 0 0 30 m and 0 60 0 90 m soil depths due to plant water uptake as roots has progressed to 0 90 m depth coupled with evaporative losses from the surface in both vegetative and reproductive periods maximum aw i e minimum depletion was observed at either 0 30 0 60 m soil depth or below 0 90 m soil depth the reason behind high aw in 0 30 0 60 m soil profile is the presence of high clay content layer argillic layer at 0 30 0 60 m depth fig 3c this resulted in high aw and consequently insufficient aeration thus low plant water uptake similar results were observed by djaman and irmak 2012 at the same location they indicated around 51 of soil water extraction from 0 to 0 30 m soil profile and only 10 from 0 30 to 0 60 high aw below 0 90 m can be attributed to low root density at that depth thus less plant water uptake during the vegetative growth period no significant effect p 0 05 of any treatment irrigation and nitrogen and soil type on aw was observed at 0 0 30 m and 0 60 1 2 m soil depths however significant effect p 0 05 of soil type on aw was observed at 0 30 0 60 m clay layer at 0 30 0 60 m depth the aw in s1 was significantly greater p 0 05 than s2 whereas s3 was not significantly different p 0 05 from either s1 or s2 table 7 and can be attributed to significantly greater swhc in 0 30 0 60 m soil profile in s1 table 6 in the reproductive period effect of nitrogen and irrigation treatment on aw at each depth in each soil type was analyzed separately in this period no significant effect p 0 05 of irrigation and nitrogen treatment and their interaction was observed on aw in s2 and s3 at any depth however in s1 significant effect of irrigation and nitrogen treatments and their interaction existed except at 0 30 0 60 m soil depth tables 8 and 9 in s2 and s3 even though the amount of irrigation in vri was lower than fri no significant difference in aw between vri and fri showed that excess water in fri treatment was either lost to deep percolation and runoff or translated to etc in s1 there was a significant main effect of nitrogen treatment at 0 0 30 m significant main effect of irrigation and nitrogen at 0 60 0 90 and significant interaction effect of irrigation and nitrogen at 0 90 1 2 m soil depth on aw table 9 in general there was a lower aw under vri treatment than in fri the possible explanation is that the frequent irrigations in the fri treatment helped with frequent replenishment of water which prevented cyclical water stress that can occur with longer irrigation intervals as in vri treatment even if the total amount of seasonal irrigation is the same bucks et al 1988 radin et al 1989 comparing nitrogen treatments significantly lower aw in pp treatment as compared with vrf at 0 0 30 m and as compared to vrf and frf at 0 60 0 90 m was observed under fri in s1 table 9 in general in s1 lowest aw was observed in either pp or frf even though the nitrogen amount in both frf and pp treatment was same and was greater than vrf it can be suggested that higher rates of nitrogen 246 kg ha 1 can have higher soil water extraction due to deeper roots in those treatments lenka et al 2009 benbi 1989 no trend of nitrogen application on aw was observed in s2 and s3 overall results indicated that effect of irrigation and nitrogen application on aw was significant only in s1 whereas no significant effect of any treatment was observed in s2 and s3 the difference in effect of treatments on aw between soils could be related to the elevation and slope in that soil type which determines the flow and accumulation of soil water in different positions of the landscape ruffo et al 2006 kanwar et al 1988 lower elevation and higher slopes in s2 and s3 could have resulted in poor conditions for plant growth excessive water for prolonged period in the root zone in all treatments 3 4 treatment effects on maize evapotranspiration during vegetative and reproductive period to understand how different irrigation and nitrogen treatments in different soil types affect plant water use etc between frf vrf and pp nitrogen treatments under fri and vri in three soil types were compared in maize vegetative and reproductive growth periods tables 10 12 in 2015 no irrigation was applied whereas only 1 irrigation was applied in 2016 in the vegetative period in 2017 more irrigations were applied in the vegetative period as compared to 2015 and 2016 due to higher crop water demand that can be attribute to higher incoming solar radiation and higher vpd in vegetative period of 2017 table 5 on average 76 2 mm of irrigation in fri and 26 17 and 0 mm of irrigation in vri in s1 s2 and s3 respectively was applied in 2017 table 2 because of no to very little irrigation in vegetative period of 2015 and 2016 any difference in etc in 2015 and 2016 among treatments during vegetative period were due to soil type or nitrogen treatment or their interaction table 10 in 2015 vegetative etc in s3 was 15 and 14 mm greater than etc in s1 and s2 respectively the greater vegetative etc in s3 was most likely due to greater surface evaporation due to incomplete canopy cover lai 2 sharma and irmak 2020 the sparse crop leaf canopy lai 2 can result in considerable surface evaporation as compared with full canopy cover ogola et al 2002 the effect of nitrogen treatments on etc was also significant p 0 05 in 2015 with 9 and 10 mm greater etc in pp nitrogen treatment as compared with frf and vrf respectively table 11 in 2016 the effect of interaction of soil and nitrogen treatment on etc was significant p 0 05 table 10 no statistical impact of irrigation treatments on vegetative etc was observed in 2016 which indicates that there was enough soil water in the root zone to meet the crop water requirements in the plots where no irrigation was applied in the vegetative period as compared to the plots where irrigation was applied table 2 the etc in pp nitrogen treatment was 54 mm greater than frf in s1 whereas no significant difference between pp and frf existed in s2 and s3 p 0 05 the etc in frf was 43 mm greater than vrf in s2 whereas no significant difference occurred between frf and vrf in s1 and s3 p 0 05 comparing the vrf and pp nitrogen treatments no significant difference existed in any soil type in 2016 overall in 2016 greater etc was observed in s1 as compared with s2 and s3 the nitrogen treatments had a significant impact p 0 05 which could be attributed to soil type environmental conditions impact of soil type and environment on n mineralization and timing of nitrogen application rather than the amount further research is needed to assess the comprehensive impact of nitrogen fertilizer timing and soil chemical properties on vegetative etc in 2017 effect of irrigation and soil type on etc was significant p 0 05 however nitrogen treatment did not significantly impact etc table 10 the etc in fri treatment in 2017 was 47 mm greater than vri that can be attributed to higher irrigation amount in fri in that period as compared to vri also similar to 2016 s1 had significantly higher p 0 05 etc 244 mm than s2 179 mm and s3 198 mm in 2017 it could be argued that lower etc in s2 and s3 as compared with s1 was due to lower irrigation but in this research there was enough soil water in the root zone fig 9 to meet crop water requirements because of which no irrigation was recommended for some plots under vri it is likely that the greater aw and lower etc in those plots where no irrigation was recommended in s2 and s3 was due to the lower elevation sharma and irmak 2020 because of lower elevation soil pores were filled with water for an appreciable length of time that restricted the growth of roots thus impacted etc kanwar et al 1988 greater variability in etc among treatments was observed in reproductive period as compared with vegetative period due to the effects of soil type irrigation nitrogen and their interaction table 10 in 2015 no significant impact p 0 05 of any treatment and soil type was observed in reproductive period etc due to lower irrigation amounts in this season in 2016 significant effect of irrigation and nitrogen treatment existed on reproductive etc whereas interaction effect of soil and irrigation and soil and nitrogen treatment was significant p 0 05 in 2017 tables 10 and 12 in 2016 reproductive etc in fri was 53 mm greater than vri which could be attributed to 50 mm greater irrigation in fri in terms of nitrogen pp treatment has significantly higher p 0 05 etc as compared with frf which shows the timing of nitrogen application plays an important role in crop water uptake similar results were obtained in 2017 however significant interaction p 0 05 of irrigation and nitrogen with soil type was also observed in s1 etc under pp nitrogen treatment was significantly greater p 0 05 than vrf but no statistical difference was observed between pp and frf in s2 significant difference occurred between frf and vrf treatment whereas in s3 no significant difference between nitrogen treatments was observed in 2017 effect of irrigation treatment on reproductive etc was not significant in s1 whereas significantly higher etc under fri as compared with vri was observed in s2 and s3 table 12 this shows that amount and timing of irrigation had a direct impact on etc in s2 and s3 but not in s1 even though significant differences occurred in aw among different irrigation treatments at reproductive growth stage in s1 no difference in etc between vri and fri revealed that the lower aw in vri was due to higher plant water uptake as etc is directly correlated to grain yield irmak 2015 it can be assumed that vri has a potential in maintaining the optimum grain yield by using less water as compared to fri in certain soil types like s1 however additional research is required to understand the potential benefits of vri and its impact on crop yield in terms of nitrogen since the nitrogen rates between the treatments were not different it would be hard to determine the impact of nitrogen rates on etc however from the pooled data as well as from the individual year it can be suggested that pp nitrogen treatment resulted in greater etc than other nitrogen treatments details about the impact of etc under different irrigation and nitrogen treatments on grain yield are presented in the companion paper by sharma and irmak 2020 4 conclusions soil water dynamics and maize etc during vegetative and reproductive growth periods for different irrigation and nitrogen application treatments in three soil types for maize was researched in the 2015 2016 and 2017 growing seasons in the irmak research laboratory in south central nebraska the irrigation treatment did not statistically impact etc during the vegetative period for the 2015 and 2016 growing seasons however the impact of irrigation on vegetative etc in 2017 was significant due to earlier initiation of irrigation in 2017 no effect of irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer was observed on aw in the vegetative period and differences in the aw between treatments were mainly due to soil type the results indicate that vegetative period etc was primarily affected by soil type weather conditions evaporative demand and soil wetting and nitrogen fertilizer application timing in the reproductive growth period no significant effect p 0 05 of irrigation and nitrogen treatment and their interaction was observed on aw in s2 and s3 at any depth however in s1 significant effect of irrigation and nitrogen treatments and their interaction was observed except at 0 30 0 60 m soil depth these results indicate that soil type and topography play important role in determining the impact of irrigation and nitrogen on aw the effect of irrigation treatment on reproductive etc was not significant in s1 in 2017 whereas significantly higher etc under fri as compared with vri was observed in s2 and s3 the fact that significant differences occurred in aw among vri and fri at reproductive growth stage in s1 and no significant differences in etc between vri and fri were observed revealed that the lower aw in vri was due to higher plant water uptake and that excess irrigation water applied in fri treatment was either lost to deep percolation or runoff this indicated the potential benefit of vri in s1 significantly lower etc in vri as compared with fri in s2 and s3 in reproductive period in 2017 was likely due to restricted root growth due to excessive water in the root zone for prolonged period due to lower elevation depression in s2 and s3 these results show that irrigation scheduling based on soil water status only sometimes does not take into account the changes in water status in the plant and root tissues creating plant water stress even though enough water is available in soil profile in terms of nitrogen fertilizer effect the nitrogen rates between the treatments were not substantially different so it would be difficult to determine the impact of nitrogen rates however from the pooled data as well as from the individual year data it can be suggested that pp nitrogen treatment resulted in greater etc than other nitrogen treatments the results of this research indicated that soil water dynamics is a strong function of not only management practices irrigation and nitrogen treatments but is also a strong function of site specific soil

10307,selection of a suitable low pressure sprinkler can be an effective measure to reduce energy consumption wind drift and evaporation losses the crop canopy often redistributes the applied water during sprinkler irrigation therefore we investigated the water distributions above and below the canopy as well as their differences in heermann and hein uniformity coefficient cuh under three commonly used sprinkler types nelson d3000 nelson r3000 and komet kpt and two growth stages of summer maize 6 leaf stage and tasselling stage to evaluate the effect of crop canopy on the water distribution of low pressure sprinklers the variations in the soil water content swc and heermann and hein uniformity coefficient of soil water content cuhs were investigated further at 1 h before 1 h after and 24 h additionally the effects of growth indices and sprinkler types on cuh and cuhs values were analysed both the water application depths and cuh values above the canopy were significantly higher than those below the canopy and the differences above and below the canopy increased significantly with the growth of maize the cuhs after irrigation mainly depended on the initial swc and cuhs values but was minimally correlated with the plant height leaf area index and sprinkler application uniformity although the cuh above the canopy 78 1 of d3000 was significantly lower than r3000 and kpt sprinklers both exceeding 90 the cuhs of d3000 reached more than 93 after irrigation this result indicated that the effect of sprinkler application uniformity was not important as predicted and a good cuhs would be achieved after canopy interception and soil water redistribution irrespective of sprinkler types this study provides an insight into the selection of best low pressure sprinklers in centre pivot irrigation systems keywords low pressure sprinkler water distribution maize canopy irrigation uniformity soil water content centre pivot 1 introduction the advancement of scaled agricultural production and land use intensification has significantly increased the use of centre pivot sprinkler irrigation systems in china due to their high irrigation efficiency extensive coverage of the irrigated area and low labour costs li et al 2017 it was estimated that by the end of 2019 around eighteen thousand centre pivot and linear move irrigation systems were in use nationwide the corresponding irrigated lands included approximately six hundred thousand ha accounting for approximately 14 2 of china s total sprinkler irrigated lands the centre pivot systems have gradually adopted low pressure spray plate sprinklers instead of medium and high pressure impact sprinklers to reduce energy consumption musick et al 1988 the low pressure spray plate sprinklers are classified as fixed spray plate sprinklers fspss and rotating spray plate sprinklers rspss the most popular fspss and rspss in china are d3000 and r3000 series sprinklers respectively nelson irrigation corp walla walla washington usa in sprinkler irrigation projects the d3000 sprinkler is usually used with a 36 grooved plate producing 36 discrete streams yan et al 2010 whereas the r3000 sprinkler is used with a deflector plate with grooves to break up the nozzle jet and produce 6 discrete streams king and bjorneberg 2011 accumulating studies on the hydraulic performance of these two sprinklers have shown high working pressure and energy consumption by the r3000 sprinkler irrespective of a large spraying range small application rate and relatively uniform water distribution hanson and orloff 1996 hills and barragan 1998 faci et al 2001 in contrast the d3000 sprinkler had much lower working pressure and cost making it more attractive and competitive in the marketplace however this type of sprinkler had high instantaneous application rates that were prone to cause soil erosion and crop damage deboer and chu 2001 silva 2007 yan et al 2011 besides the d3000 and r3000 the kpt komet irrigation corp lienz austria an emerging low pressure sprinkler with an oscillating spray plate is becoming more popular in china due to its strong wind resistance nevertheless very few studies have been reported on the use of this sprinkler water distribution uniformity is an essential parameter for a sprinkler irrigation system design tarjuelo et al 1999 li et al 2015 several factors such as the sprinkler head and nozzle weather conditions and management practices affect the sprinkler irrigation uniformity louie and selker 2000 playán et al 2005 zhang et al 2013 sprinkler irrigation uniformity is often evaluated by the christiansen uniformity coefficient cu christiansen 1942 and several standards have been developed for determining the cu asae standards 1994 chinese standards 2007 of them gb t 50085 2007 chinese standards 2007 requires the cu value to be no less than 85 for travelling sprinkler systems or 75 for fixed sprinkler irrigation systems however the target uniformity coefficients have been a focus in china for a long time according to some researchers crop canopy interference and soil water dynamics should be reconsidered in sprinkler uniformity as they found the crop canopy structure playing a major role in the spatial distribution of sprinkler irrigation water and soil water especially for maize plants zheng et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 reported that the measured throughfall stemflow and interception loss accounted for 65 2 22 3 and 12 5 of the cumulative gross rainfall during entire maize growing season respectively notably the relative throughfall declined from 83 2 at the seedling stage to 52 2 at the tasselling stage and then increased to 58 6 at the maturity stage zapata et al 2018 reported that for the low pressure treatment the cu below the canopy was higher than the cu above the canopy under low wind and fully developed maize canopy conditions while it was a contrast to the designed pressure treatment li and kawano 1996 also reported that the cu of soil water contents exceeded 90 even when the cu above the canopy was below 60 research fronts have confirmed the significant effect of maize canopy on the sprinkler water distribution although they mainly focused on the rainfall or fixed sprinkler irrigation systems however a few studies have been reported on travelling sprinkler systems as the second largest grain variety cultivated in china maize is mostly distributed in the northeast north and in part of northwest china the drought and decreased rainfall in these areas have increased the use of centre pivot sprinkler irrigation systems to plant the maize in large areas therefore it is necessary to determine the effect of maize canopy on the water distribution under the centre pivot studies have reported that the average of canopy interception ranged from 1 8 mm to 2 7 mm during all maize growth stages under the centre pivot and notably about half of the water reaching the soil surface was from stemflow steiner et al 1983 lamm and manges 2000 similarly lamm and manges 2000 reported the maize interception for a high pressure impact sprinkler to be 2 06 mm which was higher than 1 85 mm for a low pressure spray sprinkler these results indicated that the water redistribution through maize canopy was aﬀected by the sprinkler types and working pressures of the irrigation machine but they lacked information regarding the dynamic variations of soil water with the time after canopy interception therefore further research on maize canopy effects on the irrigation water and soil water distributions of low pressure sprinklers with a centre pivot was necessitated the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the effect of maize canopy on the water distribution under three commonly used sprinkler types nelson d3000 nelson r3000 and komet kpt and two growth stages of summer maize 6 leaf stage and tasselling stage 2 to determine the effect of maize growth indices and sprinkler types on the uniformity of irrigation water and soil water and 3 to investigate the variation of soil water content and its uniformity with the time before and after irrigation and its influence on soil water uniformity 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experiment was conducted at the tongzhou experimental station of china agricultural university beijing china with the geographical coordinates of 39 41 59 n latitude 116 41 01 e longitude and 21 m above mean sea level the experimental area was located in a typical temperate monsoon climatic zone in a continental semi humid region with annual mean precipitation of 620 mm the soil type was sandy loam with a bulk density of 1 6 10 3 g mm 3 and a ph of 8 2 the field capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil layer 0 0 4 m were 0 31 mm3 mm 3 and 2 75 10 6 m s 1 respectively the summer maize nongda 86 was seeded on june 23rd 2019 with a row spacing of 0 6 m plant spacing of 0 2 m and harvest date of september 29th 2019 fertilisation weeds and pests were effectively controlled during the maize growth 2 2 experimental design all experiments were performed in a sprinkler irrigation field 192 96 m irrigated using a two span centre pivot irrigation system debont inc beijing china of 89 2 m in length the first span second span and overhang lengths were 43 3 m 37 5 m and 8 4 m respectively the centre pivot s inlet pressure and flow rate were measured by a pressure gauge hongqi y 100 range 0 1 mpa accuracy of 0 1 and an electronic flow metre emf 5000 range 0 60 m3 h 1 accuracy of 0 5 respectively meanwhile the required irrigation depth was achieved by a percent timer which controlled the centre pivot s moving speed yan et al 2010 the centre pivot consisted of 28 sprinklers with an average spacing of 2 88 m to accurately compare the water distributions of different types of low pressure sprinklers affected by crop canopy only three sprinklers at the overhang were employed for the irrigation test and the remaining twenty five sprinklers of the two spans were closed by solenoid valves furthermore the three sprinklers at the overhang were equipped with the same sprinkler type and nozzle size for a single irrigation test to facilitate the comparison of different sprinkler treatments as depicted in table 1 weather data was collected with an automated weather station hobo u30 usa within 100 m from the site measuring rainfall temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction during the experiment the experiments were performed under low wind ws 1 0 m s 1 conditions with no rainfall r 0 in this study three types of low pressure sprinklers were experimented separately 1 the nelson d3000 a fixed spray plate sprinkler equipped with a 36 grooved blue plate 2 the nelson r3000 a rotating spray plate sprinkler equipped with a brown plate and 3 the komet kpt an oscillating spray plate sprinkler equipped with a 10 groove black plate each sprinkler was installed at an elevation of 1 6 m above the ground and equipped with a 15 psi 103 kpa pressure regulator nelson irrigation corp walla walla washington usa for maintaining a consistent flow rate perry and pocknee 2003 the nozzle numbers of these sprinklers were 30 diameter of 5 95 mm the corresponding flow rates of d3000 r3000 and kpt sprinklers were calculated to be 1 38 m3 h 1 1 38 m3 h 1 and 1 43 m3 h 1 respectively according to the flow data of different numbered nozzles provided by the manufacturer sprinkler tests were mainly focused on the maize growth stages of 6 leaf stage v6 and tasselling stage vt during which droughts frequently occurred in the experimental area the tests included the water distributions above and below the canopy maize growth indices and soil water variation over the time before and after irrigation in total six combinations of three sprinkler types and two maize growth stages were included in the experiment having three replicates each nine experimental plots were arranged within the overhang coverage for each growth stage the applied irrigation water of the centre pivot in each experimental plot was kept the same with an average irrigation depth of 32 7 mm to ensure identical experimental conditions 2 3 water application rate measurements of individual sprinklers an automatic testing system was employed indoors to measure the water application rates of three types of sprinklers under no wind conditions according to the iso 15886 3 iso standards 2012 a total of 18 catch cans an opening diameter of 150 mm and a height of 430 mm were arranged along a radial line on the automatic testing system the horizontal distance between the first catch can and tested sprinkler was 1 m and the remainder of catch cans were spaced 0 5 m apart the weight of water in the catch cans could be collected automatically by bk 3a load cells accuracy of 0 6 g and subsequently the water application rates could be generated the height difference between the sprinkler and catch can s opening was approximately 0 5 m which corresponded to the vertical distance from the sprinklers mounted on the centre pivot to the catch cans above the canopy the test duration for all three sprinklers was 1 h and each test was repeated three times to obtain the average value 2 4 water distribution measurements above and below the canopy the field water distribution patterns were evaluated by 15 catch cans labelled 1 15 fig 1 in one replicate of each irrigation treatment the catch cans were white plastic cylinders with an opening diameter of 95 mm and a height of 160 mm uniformly placed on three radial straight lines the distance among the near ends of the three lines was 1 m and the spacing of the catch cans on each line was also 1 m fig 1a the sprinkler suspending in the middle of the overhang was passed onto the top of catch cans no 3 no 8 and no 13 during the experiment at the v6 stage both water distributions above and below the canopy were measured as the average maize height in the field was approximately 1 1 m which was lower than the sprinkler installation height of 1 6 m therefore it was acceptable to place the catch cans at a respective elevation of 1 1 m and ground surface to measure the water volume above and below the canopy as depicted in fig 1b the catch cans above and below the canopy were placed in a staggered arrangement to prevent the water collection of catch cans below the canopy from being affected by that above the canopy however at the vt stage the water distribution below the canopy was only obtained as most of the maize height exceeded 2 m and the sprinkler applied water did not reach the canopy therefore the water distribution measurement above the canopy was not practical after the completion of the experiment an electronic balance range 0 30 kg accuracy of 0 1 g was used to quickly weigh the water collected at each catch can and these results were finally converted to irrigation depths a modified heermann and hein formula asae standards 1996 was used to evaluate both water distributions uniformity above and below the canopy for a centre pivot irrigation system therefore in the three repetitions of each irrigation treatment a total of 9 groups of radial water distribution uniformities above and below the canopy were calculated using the following equation 1 cu h 1 i 1 m h i h s i i 1 m h i s i 100 where cu h is the heermann and hein coefficient of uniformity s i is the distance of the ith catch can from the pivot point m m is the number of catch cans h i is the measured water depth in the ith catch can mm and h is the weighted average water depth of all catch cans mm calculated as 2 h i 1 m h i s i i 1 m s i 2 5 soil water content measurements the oven drying method o kelly 2004 was employed to determine the soil water content swc values at 1 h before 1 h after and 24 h after irrigation nine measurement points a to i fig 1 were selected at each experimental plot for soil sample collection the soil samples were obtained with a 38 mm diameter hand auger at approximately 0 2 m intervals up to 0 4 m depth for each measurement point in total 81 measurement points were there in the 9 experiment plots and a total of 972 soil samples were collected at the v6 and vt stages these samples were then oven dried taisite wgl 230b china at 105 110 to obtain the corresponding swc the modified heermann and hein formula was also applied to evaluate the uniformity of swc values for different irrigation treatments similarly a total of 9 groups of the uniformities of swc at the depths of 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 4 m were calculated for each irrigation treatment using the below equation 3 cu hs 1 j 1 n θ j θ l j i 1 n θ j l j 100 where cu hs is the heermann and hein uniformity coefficient of soil water content l j is the distance of the jth measured point from the pivot point m n is the number of measured points θ j is the measured soil water content in the jth point and θ is the weighted average soil water content of all measured points calculated as 4 θ j 1 n θ j l j j 1 n l j 2 6 plant height and leaf area index measurements plant height ph and leaf area la were measured at the v6 and vt stages at each growth stage 27 plants were randomly selected from 9 experimental plots three plants per plot and a ruler with centimetric accuracy was used to measure plant indices the total la of maize per unit area in each plot is the average la of three plants multiplied by the maize s density per unit area therefore the leaf area index lai of each plot was determined by the total la of maize divided by the field s unit area kang et al 2005 2 7 data analysis the regression analysis with origin 8 5 software originlab northampton ma usa was employed to analyse the relationships between the cuh above and below the canopy and below the canopy and lai and ph the coefficient of determination r2 was used to test the goodness of fit of the regression models a higher r2 value means a higher model accuracy similarly the pearson correlation assessed as significant at the p 0 05 level was employed to analyse the correlations between the growth indices and the cuh values below the canopy and between the cuhs values at 1 h after irrigation and their effect factors the pearson correlation coefficient r was used to evaluate the degree of correlation between the variables positive values represent positive correlation negative values represent negative correlation additionally the differences between the treatments in the measured ph lai cuh values above and below the canopy swc and cuhs were subjected to multi way analysis of variance anova and independent sample t test respectively again assessed as significant at the p 0 05 level means were separated using fisher s protected lsd at 0 05 level of significance with spss 20 0 analytical software ibm corp armonk ny usa finally multiple regression analysis was applied using 1stopt 1 5 software 7d soft high technology inc beijing china to establish a model for predicting the cuhs at 1 h after irrigation under different growth stages 3 results and discussion 3 1 radial water distribution characterisation the radial water distribution pattern is an essential parameter for evaluating sprinklers hydraulic performance playán et al 2006 faci et al 2001 reported that the water distribution of r3000 had a conical shape whereas d3000 had a circular crown shape fig 2 illustrates the radial water distribution curves of three sprinkler types under a 15 psi pressure regulator and 30 nozzle at 0 5 m height from the catch cans opening the results demonstrated that both r3000 and kpt sprinklers had the highest application rates near the sprinkler approaching 15 5 mm h 1 and 26 3 mm h 1 respectively with the increased distance from the sprinkler the water application rate of r3000 gradually decreased within the range of throw radius however the kpt application rate was found to decrease rapidly to 11 mm h 1 at 2 2 m from the sprinkler and then slightly rebound until 5 m finally the kpt s water application rate dropped to zero with the increased distance to the throw radius end besides the water volume collected within 1 8 m and 3 4 6 7 m from the sprinkler was significantly higher for the kpt than the r3000 suggesting a strong application rate of kpt sprinkler in irrigation practices the sprinklers operating pressure and nozzle diameter should be selected properly to prevent soil erosion compared to r3000 and kpt sprinklers the d3000 s water application rate diﬀered significantly with water application mainly concentrated between 4 m and 7 m from the sprinkler additionally the application rates at 5 5 m and 6 m reached 118 mm h 1 and 120 mm h 1 respectively that were remarkably higher than other distances similar findings were reported by yan et al 2010 and wang et al 2020 for different sprinkler working conditions consequently the structural difference of the three sprinklers strongly affected the water distribution characteristics thereby affecting their irrigation performance in the field 3 2 effect of maize canopy on water distributions fig 3 illustrates the water distributions assessed by both above and below the canopy for three types of sprinklers under two maize growth stages with an average irrigation depth of 32 7 mm the sprinkler application depth ad collected above the canopy was found to be significantly higher than below the canopy for instance at the v6 stage the average ad values above the canopy of d3000 r3000 and kpt sprinklers were 25 2 mm 28 1 mm and 30 2 mm respectively but the ad values below the canopy were only 10 9 mm 10 2 mm and 10 4 mm respectively as the growth stage increased maize stemflow increased significantly liu et al 2015 during the vt stage the average ad values below the canopy were correspondingly reduced to 5 1 mm 5 5 mm and 7 5 mm compared to the ad values above the canopy of the three sprinklers 25 2 mm 28 1 mm and 30 2 mm additionally the average ad value above the canopy of d3000 was found to be the lowest 25 2 mm among the three sprinklers but its throughfall ad below the canopy divided by ad above the canopy remained the highest at the v6 stage accounting for 43 3 of the irrigation amount this discrepancy was due to the concentrated precipitation rate the maximum of which approached 120 mm h 1 of d3000 sprinkler that easily allowed the irrigation water to pass through the leaf layer at the vt stage the throughfalls of the three sprinkler types d3000 r3000 and kpt were 20 2 19 6 and 24 8 respectively which were reduced by 23 1 16 7 and 9 6 percentage points than the v6 stage this result indicated that the powerful instantaneous application rate of d3000 sprinkler could no longer overcome the interception of crop canopy at the vt stage as reported by lamm and manges 2000 the canopy structure of maize tended to pass the precipitation toward the plant stem with a funnelling effect stemflow became the predominant flow path for sprinkler irrigation water accounting for approximately 53 after tasselling moreover kpt s throughfall was the highest 24 8 during the vt stage which implied that the oscillating effect of kpt sprinkler could help to reduce the interception of irrigation water in mature corn canopy to determine the effect of maize canopy on the uniformity of sprinkler water distribution fig 4 illustrates the relationships between the cuh values above and below the canopy for three types of sprinklers under two growth stages of maize at the v6 stage the cuh above the canopy exhibited a linear correlation with the cuh below the canopy for d3000 sprinkler r2 of 0 402 but no relationship with the cuh below the canopy of r3000 and kpt sprinklers was observed fig 4a however the correlations of all the three sprinklers improved when maize reached the vt stage the r2 values of d3000 r3000 and kpt sprinklers increased to 0 563 0 247 and 0 425 respectively fig 4b further analysis of fig 4 indicated that the cuh below the canopy for both r3000 and kpt sprinklers significantly decreased with an increase in the cuh above the canopy however the cuh below the canopy for d3000 increased significantly this water distribution difference among the three sprinklers might be attributed to the sprinklers hydraulic performance maize canopy structure or catch cans size as shown in table 2 the average cuh values above the canopy were 78 1 95 7 and 93 7 for d3000 r3000 and kpt sprinklers respectively these values were higher than the application uniformities of fsps and rsps sprinklers averaged 68 6 and 78 2 reported by li 2016 based on the small sprinkler spacing that allowed more water to overlap and the irrigation test was basically unaffected by wind the average cuh values above the canopy for r3000 and kpt sprinklers were significantly higher than d3000 sprinkler p 0 05 but the difference between the r3000 and kpt sprinklers was non significant p 0 05 this result was consistent with the finding of hills and barragan 1998 on a linear move sprinkler machine additionally the cuh above the canopy exceeded the cuh below the canopy for any sprinkler types irrespective of the growth stage this finding was consistent with the maize results reported by zapata et al 2018 while contrasted with the results of cotton and wheat reported by ayars et al 1991 and li and rao 2000 respectively which might be attributable to the differences in the canopy structure of various crops in this study the differences between the cuh values above and below the canopy of the three sprinklers d3000 r3000 and kpt averaged 4 6 23 7 and 30 4 percentage points and 19 5 43 3 and 54 5 percentage points for v6 and vt stages respectively these results suggested that the canopy had the lowest impact on the cuh below the canopy of d3000 and the highest impact on kpt as the growth stage increased the influence of the canopy on the cuh below the canopy became more significant p 0 05 table 2 however if the cuh above the canopy was small less than 80 the reduction of the cuh below the canopy would be less and conversely greater than 90 the reduction would be greater even though its cuh value below the canopy might be lower than the former similar results have also been reported in previous studies ayars et al 1991 li and rao 2000 3 3 effect of maize growth indices on water distributions plant height ph and leaf area index lai are the two most crucial indicators of crop growth affecting sprinkler irrigation performance ayars et al 1991 sanchez et al 2010 in this study the ph and lai of maize had significantly p 0 01 results not presented negative correlations with the cuh below the canopy this result was contrasted with the relationship between canopy interception and crop growth indices kang et al 2005 zheng et al 2018 wang et al 2020 this finding indicated that crop growth indices were closely related to sprinkler irrigation performance and should be highly considered during the design of irrigation systems during the v6 stage of maize no significant differences existed in ph p 0 05 and lai p 0 05 among d3000 r3000 and kpt sprinklers table 2 the ph and lai values of the three sprinklers averaged 1 1 m and 3 4 respectively both the plant height and leaf area significantly increased p 0 05 with the maize growth at the vt stage the three sprinklers average ph and lai values reached 2 2 m and 6 8 respectively table 2 to further determine the relationships between maize growth indices and cuh values below the canopy fig 5 presents the linear regression equations of ph lai and cuh below the canopy for three sprinkler types and two growth stages of them the r2 values of d3000 r3000 and kpt sprinklers were 0 832 0 844 0 750 and 0 845 0 877 0 749 for the relationships between ph and cuh below the canopy and between lai and cuh below the canopy respectively these results demonstrated that r3000 sprinkler had a stronger correlation of cuh below the canopy with maize growth indices than other two sprinklers however the antithetical result for the relationship between the cuh above and below the canopy was noteworthy fig 4 thus the cuh below the canopy of r3000 sprinkler was mainly dependent on the maize s growth status and minimally affected by the cuh above the canopy meanwhile further analysis showed that the cuh below the canopy of kpt declined fastest with the increase of ph and lai followed by the r3000 and d3000 declined the slowest 3 4 variation of soil water contents with time after sprinkler irrigation after the maize canopy interception a part of irrigation water will infiltrate into the soil and change the swc these changes have been proven to affect many soil processes including microbial biomass activity nutrient uptake by plants and nitrogen cycling van wesenbeeck and kachanoski 1988 to reveal the change in the swc values before and after irrigation table 3 presents the variability of swc values of 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 4 m soil depths at 1 h before 1 h after and 24 h after irrigation for three sprinkler types at v6 and vt stages it was observed that the initial swc values 1 h before irrigation for the 0 0 2 m depth were significantly higher than the 0 2 0 4 m depth p 0 01 results not presented and their difference averaged 2 3 percentage points for each treatment this might have happened due to the upward transportation of soil water affected by the strong evaporation of the soil surface in summer kondo et al 1990 when irrigation was complete swc values significantly increased overall the soil water distribution at the 0 0 2 m depth showed more positive increases at 1 h after irrigation compared to the 0 2 0 4 m depth especially during the vt stage p 0 05 table 3 dukes et al 2006 believed that this result occurred due to the less sensitivity of soil water variability towards the soil depth increase for v6 and vt stages the average swc differences of d3000 r3000 and kpt sprinklers between 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 4 m depths reached 3 9 3 5 and 3 4 percentage points and 5 0 2 0 and 3 2 percentage points respectively this finding indicated that except for the slight decrease in the average swc difference of r3000 during the vt stage all other treatment differences increased compared to the 1 h before irrigation 2 3 percentage points this may be attributed to the deep percolation when equipped with the r3000 sprinkler during the vt stage which resulted in a significant increase in the swc values for the 0 2 0 4 m soil layer p 0 05 table 3 the water distribution in the soil changed steadily following the irrigation at 24 h after irrigation the swc values across all treatments significantly decreased p 0 05 in the 0 0 2 m depth and correspondingly increased in the 0 2 0 4 m depth except the d3000 and kpt treatments at the v6 stage and the r3000 treatment at the vt stage the reduction in swc values at the 0 2 0 4 m depth at 24 h after irrigation might be related to the poor water preserving capability of the lower soil layer at some measuring points for all the three treatments the swc difference between the two depths at 24 h after irrigation averaged 1 8 percentage points which was lower than the average initial swc difference 2 3 percentage points this result suggested that the redistribution of sprinkler water within the soil could effectively improve soil water distribution uniformity ayars et al 1991 li and kawano 1996 although some measured points had opposite results due to deep percolation water losses or soil layers water conductivity it can be confirmed from table 3 that the swc values at the 0 0 2 m soil depth were always higher than the 0 2 0 4 soil depth irrespective of before or after irrigation this finding may be attributed to climatic conditions such as the rainfall before the experiment the upward transport of soil water due to the strong evaporation of soil surface in summer or the sensitivity of the soil moisture to irrigation water decreased with the increase of soil depth dukes et al 2006 3 5 variation of soil water uniformity with time after sprinkler irrigation cuhs closely related to the uniformity of the initial swc and total applied water is a crucial factor for crop yield li and kawano 1996 dukes et al 2006 to analyse the variability of cuhs with the time before and after irrigation table 4 shows the cuhs values at 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 4 m soil depths at 1 h before 1 h after and 24 h after irrigation for three sprinkler types and two growth stages the average values of cuhs under different treatments were above 93 which was a desirable value of the uniformity for sprinkler irrigation projects further analysis indicated that the cuhs before irrigation was non significant from after irrigation p 0 05 even if the actual water contents in the soil increased according to wallach 1990 this observation indicated a dampening effect on the nonuniformity due to the occurrence of infiltration similar results have been reported by li and kawano 1996 for bare soil and by dukes et al 2006 on a turfgrass plot according to an independent sample t test the difference in cuhs between two soil layers of 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 4 m was also nonsignificant p 0 05 results not presented implying that the cuhs was not greatly affected by the soil depth in this study taken together soil water redistribution could effectively improve the cuhs but in the soil with a high initial cuhs the changes in swc had no significant effect on the cuhs to further study the effect of soil water distribution uniformity the correlations between the cuhs values at 1 h after irrigation and their influence factors under different growth stages and soil depths were analysed and depicted in table 5 it was apparent that the swc and cuhs at 1 h before irrigation were significantly correlated p 0 05 with the cuhs at 1 h after irrigation because the initial swc and cuhs values were directly related to soil bulk density and pore distribution which in turn affected the movement of soil water after irrigation this indicated that the cuhs was dependent on the initial soil conditions before irrigation and minimally related to external conditions such as canopy structure and sprinkler application uniformity this result was similar to the findings of li and kawano 1996 and dukes et al 2006 in contrast the relationships between the cuhs at 1 h after irrigation and the swc and cuhs values at 1 h before irrigation were negative under some conditions suggesting that the higher swc and cuhs at 1 h before irrigation might lower down the cuhs at 1 h after irrigation this might have happened as the cuhs at 1 h before irrigation had obtained very high values all above 95 for different treatments table 4 due to the influence of environmental factors such as the rainfall before irrigation therefore the increase of cuhs at 1 h after irrigation was minimal which led to this negative relationship additionally the regression models of cuhs at 1 h after irrigation cuhs 1a were established based on the swc and cuhs data at 1 h before irrigation swc1b and cuhs 1b of the two soil layers obtained during the v6 and vt stages as shown in the following equations 5 for the v6 stage cu hs 1a 24 6 swc 1b 0 62 swc 1b 2 0 06 cu hs 1b 154 61 r 2 0 744 6 for the vt stage cu hs 1a 4 66 swc 1b 0 12 swc 1b 2 0 48 cu hs 1b 2 25 r 2 0 551 3 6 distribution dynamics of irrigation water and soil water under maize canopy generally sprinkler applied water was redistributed twice after spraying first by crop canopy and then by the soil many studies li and kawano 1996 li and rao 2000 dukes et al 2006 have quantified this dynamic process and found that soil water s uniformity was greater than the application uniformity to further investigate this process fig 6 presents the cuh above and below the canopy and at the soil depths of 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 4 m at 1 h after irrigation for three types of sprinklers overall the cuh below the canopy was significantly lower than above the canopy and within the soil the average cuh values below the canopy of d3000 r3000 and kpt sprinklers were only 73 5 72 0 63 3 and 58 6 52 4 39 2 for v6 and vt stages respectively these findings signified that under a centre pivot system the uniformity of sprinkler irrigation would be significantly reduced by the interception of maize canopy which could be effectively improved due to the subsequent redistribution of soil water this result was consistent with the previous understanding of the role of soil moisture redistribution li and rao 2000 dukes et al 2006 however the effect of crop canopy on sprinkler uniformity differed from the previous results our findings were consistent with the findings of zapata et al 2018 but others found that crop canopy could improve sprinkler irrigation uniformity ayars et al 1991 li and rao 2000 this difference might be attributed to different crop canopy structures planting densities irrigation methods and sprinkler types using the three sprinklers selected in this study as an example under basically uniform experimental conditions the application uniformity of d3000 was least affected by the canopy while that of kpt was most affected as depicted in fig 6 the cuhs values among the three sprinklers were close enough averaging approximately 95 8 although the cuh above the canopy 78 1 of d3000 was significantly lower than r3000 and kpt sprinklers both exceed 90 this result confirmed that the effect of water application uniformity was not important as predicted even for a low cuh above the canopy below 80 the cuhs reached more than 93 after canopy interception and soil water redistribution which was consistent with the results reported by li and kawano 1996 4 summary and conclusions in conclusion the water application depth and cuh above the canopy were significantly higher than below the canopy for d3000 r3000 and kpt sprinklers at v6 and vt stages moreover the differences above and below the canopy significantly increased with the growth of maize as the cuh above the canopy increased the cuh below the canopy of r3000 and kpt sprinklers decreased linearly whereas the change in d3000 was reversed besides the canopy had a minimal impact on the cuh below the canopy of d3000 and the maximum on kpt overall the plant height and leaf area index of maize exhibited significantly negative correlations with the cuh below the canopy although the swc after irrigation increased the difference in cuhs was non significant compared to before irrigation and the average cuhs values of the three sprinklers were above 93 under different irrigation stages this result suggested that the redistribution of soil water could effectively improve cuhs but the changes in swc had no significant effect on the cuhs when the soil had a high initial cuhs the effect of soil water uniformity results proved that cuhs was dependent on the initial swc and cuhs values but minimally related to the plant height leaf area index and sprinkler application uniformity additionally the regression models of cuhs at 1 h after irrigation were established based on the swc and cuhs at 1 h before irrigation to predict the cuhs at 1 h after irrigation the distribution dynamics of irrigation water suggested that the effect of water application uniformity was not important as predicted although the cuh above the canopy 78 1 of d3000 was significantly lower than r3000 and kpt sprinklers both exceeded 90 its cuhs reached more than 93 like other two sprinklers after canopy interception and soil water redistribution this article presents the results obtained from the field experiments conducted with summer maize under a centre pivot irrigation system these results may not necessarily be applicable to other crops or irrigation devices in addition this study did not involve maize s stemflow measurement so further research is deserved declaration of competing interest the authors

10307,selection of a suitable low pressure sprinkler can be an effective measure to reduce energy consumption wind drift and evaporation losses the crop canopy often redistributes the applied water during sprinkler irrigation therefore we investigated the water distributions above and below the canopy as well as their differences in heermann and hein uniformity coefficient cuh under three commonly used sprinkler types nelson d3000 nelson r3000 and komet kpt and two growth stages of summer maize 6 leaf stage and tasselling stage to evaluate the effect of crop canopy on the water distribution of low pressure sprinklers the variations in the soil water content swc and heermann and hein uniformity coefficient of soil water content cuhs were investigated further at 1 h before 1 h after and 24 h additionally the effects of growth indices and sprinkler types on cuh and cuhs values were analysed both the water application depths and cuh values above the canopy were significantly higher than those below the canopy and the differences above and below the canopy increased significantly with the growth of maize the cuhs after irrigation mainly depended on the initial swc and cuhs values but was minimally correlated with the plant height leaf area index and sprinkler application uniformity although the cuh above the canopy 78 1 of d3000 was significantly lower than r3000 and kpt sprinklers both exceeding 90 the cuhs of d3000 reached more than 93 after irrigation this result indicated that the effect of sprinkler application uniformity was not important as predicted and a good cuhs would be achieved after canopy interception and soil water redistribution irrespective of sprinkler types this study provides an insight into the selection of best low pressure sprinklers in centre pivot irrigation systems keywords low pressure sprinkler water distribution maize canopy irrigation uniformity soil water content centre pivot 1 introduction the advancement of scaled agricultural production and land use intensification has significantly increased the use of centre pivot sprinkler irrigation systems in china due to their high irrigation efficiency extensive coverage of the irrigated area and low labour costs li et al 2017 it was estimated that by the end of 2019 around eighteen thousand centre pivot and linear move irrigation systems were in use nationwide the corresponding irrigated lands included approximately six hundred thousand ha accounting for approximately 14 2 of china s total sprinkler irrigated lands the centre pivot systems have gradually adopted low pressure spray plate sprinklers instead of medium and high pressure impact sprinklers to reduce energy consumption musick et al 1988 the low pressure spray plate sprinklers are classified as fixed spray plate sprinklers fspss and rotating spray plate sprinklers rspss the most popular fspss and rspss in china are d3000 and r3000 series sprinklers respectively nelson irrigation corp walla walla washington usa in sprinkler irrigation projects the d3000 sprinkler is usually used with a 36 grooved plate producing 36 discrete streams yan et al 2010 whereas the r3000 sprinkler is used with a deflector plate with grooves to break up the nozzle jet and produce 6 discrete streams king and bjorneberg 2011 accumulating studies on the hydraulic performance of these two sprinklers have shown high working pressure and energy consumption by the r3000 sprinkler irrespective of a large spraying range small application rate and relatively uniform water distribution hanson and orloff 1996 hills and barragan 1998 faci et al 2001 in contrast the d3000 sprinkler had much lower working pressure and cost making it more attractive and competitive in the marketplace however this type of sprinkler had high instantaneous application rates that were prone to cause soil erosion and crop damage deboer and chu 2001 silva 2007 yan et al 2011 besides the d3000 and r3000 the kpt komet irrigation corp lienz austria an emerging low pressure sprinkler with an oscillating spray plate is becoming more popular in china due to its strong wind resistance nevertheless very few studies have been reported on the use of this sprinkler water distribution uniformity is an essential parameter for a sprinkler irrigation system design tarjuelo et al 1999 li et al 2015 several factors such as the sprinkler head and nozzle weather conditions and management practices affect the sprinkler irrigation uniformity louie and selker 2000 playán et al 2005 zhang et al 2013 sprinkler irrigation uniformity is often evaluated by the christiansen uniformity coefficient cu christiansen 1942 and several standards have been developed for determining the cu asae standards 1994 chinese standards 2007 of them gb t 50085 2007 chinese standards 2007 requires the cu value to be no less than 85 for travelling sprinkler systems or 75 for fixed sprinkler irrigation systems however the target uniformity coefficients have been a focus in china for a long time according to some researchers crop canopy interference and soil water dynamics should be reconsidered in sprinkler uniformity as they found the crop canopy structure playing a major role in the spatial distribution of sprinkler irrigation water and soil water especially for maize plants zheng et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 reported that the measured throughfall stemflow and interception loss accounted for 65 2 22 3 and 12 5 of the cumulative gross rainfall during entire maize growing season respectively notably the relative throughfall declined from 83 2 at the seedling stage to 52 2 at the tasselling stage and then increased to 58 6 at the maturity stage zapata et al 2018 reported that for the low pressure treatment the cu below the canopy was higher than the cu above the canopy under low wind and fully developed maize canopy conditions while it was a contrast to the designed pressure treatment li and kawano 1996 also reported that the cu of soil water contents exceeded 90 even when the cu above the canopy was below 60 research fronts have confirmed the significant effect of maize canopy on the sprinkler water distribution although they mainly focused on the rainfall or fixed sprinkler irrigation systems however a few studies have been reported on travelling sprinkler systems as the second largest grain variety cultivated in china maize is mostly distributed in the northeast north and in part of northwest china the drought and decreased rainfall in these areas have increased the use of centre pivot sprinkler irrigation systems to plant the maize in large areas therefore it is necessary to determine the effect of maize canopy on the water distribution under the centre pivot studies have reported that the average of canopy interception ranged from 1 8 mm to 2 7 mm during all maize growth stages under the centre pivot and notably about half of the water reaching the soil surface was from stemflow steiner et al 1983 lamm and manges 2000 similarly lamm and manges 2000 reported the maize interception for a high pressure impact sprinkler to be 2 06 mm which was higher than 1 85 mm for a low pressure spray sprinkler these results indicated that the water redistribution through maize canopy was aﬀected by the sprinkler types and working pressures of the irrigation machine but they lacked information regarding the dynamic variations of soil water with the time after canopy interception therefore further research on maize canopy effects on the irrigation water and soil water distributions of low pressure sprinklers with a centre pivot was necessitated the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the effect of maize canopy on the water distribution under three commonly used sprinkler types nelson d3000 nelson r3000 and komet kpt and two growth stages of summer maize 6 leaf stage and tasselling stage 2 to determine the effect of maize growth indices and sprinkler types on the uniformity of irrigation water and soil water and 3 to investigate the variation of soil water content and its uniformity with the time before and after irrigation and its influence on soil water uniformity 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experiment was conducted at the tongzhou experimental station of china agricultural university beijing china with the geographical coordinates of 39 41 59 n latitude 116 41 01 e longitude and 21 m above mean sea level the experimental area was located in a typical temperate monsoon climatic zone in a continental semi humid region with annual mean precipitation of 620 mm the soil type was sandy loam with a bulk density of 1 6 10 3 g mm 3 and a ph of 8 2 the field capacity and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil layer 0 0 4 m were 0 31 mm3 mm 3 and 2 75 10 6 m s 1 respectively the summer maize nongda 86 was seeded on june 23rd 2019 with a row spacing of 0 6 m plant spacing of 0 2 m and harvest date of september 29th 2019 fertilisation weeds and pests were effectively controlled during the maize growth 2 2 experimental design all experiments were performed in a sprinkler irrigation field 192 96 m irrigated using a two span centre pivot irrigation system debont inc beijing china of 89 2 m in length the first span second span and overhang lengths were 43 3 m 37 5 m and 8 4 m respectively the centre pivot s inlet pressure and flow rate were measured by a pressure gauge hongqi y 100 range 0 1 mpa accuracy of 0 1 and an electronic flow metre emf 5000 range 0 60 m3 h 1 accuracy of 0 5 respectively meanwhile the required irrigation depth was achieved by a percent timer which controlled the centre pivot s moving speed yan et al 2010 the centre pivot consisted of 28 sprinklers with an average spacing of 2 88 m to accurately compare the water distributions of different types of low pressure sprinklers affected by crop canopy only three sprinklers at the overhang were employed for the irrigation test and the remaining twenty five sprinklers of the two spans were closed by solenoid valves furthermore the three sprinklers at the overhang were equipped with the same sprinkler type and nozzle size for a single irrigation test to facilitate the comparison of different sprinkler treatments as depicted in table 1 weather data was collected with an automated weather station hobo u30 usa within 100 m from the site measuring rainfall temperature relative humidity wind speed and direction during the experiment the experiments were performed under low wind ws 1 0 m s 1 conditions with no rainfall r 0 in this study three types of low pressure sprinklers were experimented separately 1 the nelson d3000 a fixed spray plate sprinkler equipped with a 36 grooved blue plate 2 the nelson r3000 a rotating spray plate sprinkler equipped with a brown plate and 3 the komet kpt an oscillating spray plate sprinkler equipped with a 10 groove black plate each sprinkler was installed at an elevation of 1 6 m above the ground and equipped with a 15 psi 103 kpa pressure regulator nelson irrigation corp walla walla washington usa for maintaining a consistent flow rate perry and pocknee 2003 the nozzle numbers of these sprinklers were 30 diameter of 5 95 mm the corresponding flow rates of d3000 r3000 and kpt sprinklers were calculated to be 1 38 m3 h 1 1 38 m3 h 1 and 1 43 m3 h 1 respectively according to the flow data of different numbered nozzles provided by the manufacturer sprinkler tests were mainly focused on the maize growth stages of 6 leaf stage v6 and tasselling stage vt during which droughts frequently occurred in the experimental area the tests included the water distributions above and below the canopy maize growth indices and soil water variation over the time before and after irrigation in total six combinations of three sprinkler types and two maize growth stages were included in the experiment having three replicates each nine experimental plots were arranged within the overhang coverage for each growth stage the applied irrigation water of the centre pivot in each experimental plot was kept the same with an average irrigation depth of 32 7 mm to ensure identical experimental conditions 2 3 water application rate measurements of individual sprinklers an automatic testing system was employed indoors to measure the water application rates of three types of sprinklers under no wind conditions according to the iso 15886 3 iso standards 2012 a total of 18 catch cans an opening diameter of 150 mm and a height of 430 mm were arranged along a radial line on the automatic testing system the horizontal distance between the first catch can and tested sprinkler was 1 m and the remainder of catch cans were spaced 0 5 m apart the weight of water in the catch cans could be collected automatically by bk 3a load cells accuracy of 0 6 g and subsequently the water application rates could be generated the height difference between the sprinkler and catch can s opening was approximately 0 5 m which corresponded to the vertical distance from the sprinklers mounted on the centre pivot to the catch cans above the canopy the test duration for all three sprinklers was 1 h and each test was repeated three times to obtain the average value 2 4 water distribution measurements above and below the canopy the field water distribution patterns were evaluated by 15 catch cans labelled 1 15 fig 1 in one replicate of each irrigation treatment the catch cans were white plastic cylinders with an opening diameter of 95 mm and a height of 160 mm uniformly placed on three radial straight lines the distance among the near ends of the three lines was 1 m and the spacing of the catch cans on each line was also 1 m fig 1a the sprinkler suspending in the middle of the overhang was passed onto the top of catch cans no 3 no 8 and no 13 during the experiment at the v6 stage both water distributions above and below the canopy were measured as the average maize height in the field was approximately 1 1 m which was lower than the sprinkler installation height of 1 6 m therefore it was acceptable to place the catch cans at a respective elevation of 1 1 m and ground surface to measure the water volume above and below the canopy as depicted in fig 1b the catch cans above and below the canopy were placed in a staggered arrangement to prevent the water collection of catch cans below the canopy from being affected by that above the canopy however at the vt stage the water distribution below the canopy was only obtained as most of the maize height exceeded 2 m and the sprinkler applied water did not reach the canopy therefore the water distribution measurement above the canopy was not practical after the completion of the experiment an electronic balance range 0 30 kg accuracy of 0 1 g was used to quickly weigh the water collected at each catch can and these results were finally converted to irrigation depths a modified heermann and hein formula asae standards 1996 was used to evaluate both water distributions uniformity above and below the canopy for a centre pivot irrigation system therefore in the three repetitions of each irrigation treatment a total of 9 groups of radial water distribution uniformities above and below the canopy were calculated using the following equation 1 cu h 1 i 1 m h i h s i i 1 m h i s i 100 where cu h is the heermann and hein coefficient of uniformity s i is the distance of the ith catch can from the pivot point m m is the number of catch cans h i is the measured water depth in the ith catch can mm and h is the weighted average water depth of all catch cans mm calculated as 2 h i 1 m h i s i i 1 m s i 2 5 soil water content measurements the oven drying method o kelly 2004 was employed to determine the soil water content swc values at 1 h before 1 h after and 24 h after irrigation nine measurement points a to i fig 1 were selected at each experimental plot for soil sample collection the soil samples were obtained with a 38 mm diameter hand auger at approximately 0 2 m intervals up to 0 4 m depth for each measurement point in total 81 measurement points were there in the 9 experiment plots and a total of 972 soil samples were collected at the v6 and vt stages these samples were then oven dried taisite wgl 230b china at 105 110 to obtain the corresponding swc the modified heermann and hein formula was also applied to evaluate the uniformity of swc values for different irrigation treatments similarly a total of 9 groups of the uniformities of swc at the depths of 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 4 m were calculated for each irrigation treatment using the below equation 3 cu hs 1 j 1 n θ j θ l j i 1 n θ j l j 100 where cu hs is the heermann and hein uniformity coefficient of soil water content l j is the distance of the jth measured point from the pivot point m n is the number of measured points θ j is the measured soil water content in the jth point and θ is the weighted average soil water content of all measured points calculated as 4 θ j 1 n θ j l j j 1 n l j 2 6 plant height and leaf area index measurements plant height ph and leaf area la were measured at the v6 and vt stages at each growth stage 27 plants were randomly selected from 9 experimental plots three plants per plot and a ruler with centimetric accuracy was used to measure plant indices the total la of maize per unit area in each plot is the average la of three plants multiplied by the maize s density per unit area therefore the leaf area index lai of each plot was determined by the total la of maize divided by the field s unit area kang et al 2005 2 7 data analysis the regression analysis with origin 8 5 software originlab northampton ma usa was employed to analyse the relationships between the cuh above and below the canopy and below the canopy and lai and ph the coefficient of determination r2 was used to test the goodness of fit of the regression models a higher r2 value means a higher model accuracy similarly the pearson correlation assessed as significant at the p 0 05 level was employed to analyse the correlations between the growth indices and the cuh values below the canopy and between the cuhs values at 1 h after irrigation and their effect factors the pearson correlation coefficient r was used to evaluate the degree of correlation between the variables positive values represent positive correlation negative values represent negative correlation additionally the differences between the treatments in the measured ph lai cuh values above and below the canopy swc and cuhs were subjected to multi way analysis of variance anova and independent sample t test respectively again assessed as significant at the p 0 05 level means were separated using fisher s protected lsd at 0 05 level of significance with spss 20 0 analytical software ibm corp armonk ny usa finally multiple regression analysis was applied using 1stopt 1 5 software 7d soft high technology inc beijing china to establish a model for predicting the cuhs at 1 h after irrigation under different growth stages 3 results and discussion 3 1 radial water distribution characterisation the radial water distribution pattern is an essential parameter for evaluating sprinklers hydraulic performance playán et al 2006 faci et al 2001 reported that the water distribution of r3000 had a conical shape whereas d3000 had a circular crown shape fig 2 illustrates the radial water distribution curves of three sprinkler types under a 15 psi pressure regulator and 30 nozzle at 0 5 m height from the catch cans opening the results demonstrated that both r3000 and kpt sprinklers had the highest application rates near the sprinkler approaching 15 5 mm h 1 and 26 3 mm h 1 respectively with the increased distance from the sprinkler the water application rate of r3000 gradually decreased within the range of throw radius however the kpt application rate was found to decrease rapidly to 11 mm h 1 at 2 2 m from the sprinkler and then slightly rebound until 5 m finally the kpt s water application rate dropped to zero with the increased distance to the throw radius end besides the water volume collected within 1 8 m and 3 4 6 7 m from the sprinkler was significantly higher for the kpt than the r3000 suggesting a strong application rate of kpt sprinkler in irrigation practices the sprinklers operating pressure and nozzle diameter should be selected properly to prevent soil erosion compared to r3000 and kpt sprinklers the d3000 s water application rate diﬀered significantly with water application mainly concentrated between 4 m and 7 m from the sprinkler additionally the application rates at 5 5 m and 6 m reached 118 mm h 1 and 120 mm h 1 respectively that were remarkably higher than other distances similar findings were reported by yan et al 2010 and wang et al 2020 for different sprinkler working conditions consequently the structural difference of the three sprinklers strongly affected the water distribution characteristics thereby affecting their irrigation performance in the field 3 2 effect of maize canopy on water distributions fig 3 illustrates the water distributions assessed by both above and below the canopy for three types of sprinklers under two maize growth stages with an average irrigation depth of 32 7 mm the sprinkler application depth ad collected above the canopy was found to be significantly higher than below the canopy for instance at the v6 stage the average ad values above the canopy of d3000 r3000 and kpt sprinklers were 25 2 mm 28 1 mm and 30 2 mm respectively but the ad values below the canopy were only 10 9 mm 10 2 mm and 10 4 mm respectively as the growth stage increased maize stemflow increased significantly liu et al 2015 during the vt stage the average ad values below the canopy were correspondingly reduced to 5 1 mm 5 5 mm and 7 5 mm compared to the ad values above the canopy of the three sprinklers 25 2 mm 28 1 mm and 30 2 mm additionally the average ad value above the canopy of d3000 was found to be the lowest 25 2 mm among the three sprinklers but its throughfall ad below the canopy divided by ad above the canopy remained the highest at the v6 stage accounting for 43 3 of the irrigation amount this discrepancy was due to the concentrated precipitation rate the maximum of which approached 120 mm h 1 of d3000 sprinkler that easily allowed the irrigation water to pass through the leaf layer at the vt stage the throughfalls of the three sprinkler types d3000 r3000 and kpt were 20 2 19 6 and 24 8 respectively which were reduced by 23 1 16 7 and 9 6 percentage points than the v6 stage this result indicated that the powerful instantaneous application rate of d3000 sprinkler could no longer overcome the interception of crop canopy at the vt stage as reported by lamm and manges 2000 the canopy structure of maize tended to pass the precipitation toward the plant stem with a funnelling effect stemflow became the predominant flow path for sprinkler irrigation water accounting for approximately 53 after tasselling moreover kpt s throughfall was the highest 24 8 during the vt stage which implied that the oscillating effect of kpt sprinkler could help to reduce the interception of irrigation water in mature corn canopy to determine the effect of maize canopy on the uniformity of sprinkler water distribution fig 4 illustrates the relationships between the cuh values above and below the canopy for three types of sprinklers under two growth stages of maize at the v6 stage the cuh above the canopy exhibited a linear correlation with the cuh below the canopy for d3000 sprinkler r2 of 0 402 but no relationship with the cuh below the canopy of r3000 and kpt sprinklers was observed fig 4a however the correlations of all the three sprinklers improved when maize reached the vt stage the r2 values of d3000 r3000 and kpt sprinklers increased to 0 563 0 247 and 0 425 respectively fig 4b further analysis of fig 4 indicated that the cuh below the canopy for both r3000 and kpt sprinklers significantly decreased with an increase in the cuh above the canopy however the cuh below the canopy for d3000 increased significantly this water distribution difference among the three sprinklers might be attributed to the sprinklers hydraulic performance maize canopy structure or catch cans size as shown in table 2 the average cuh values above the canopy were 78 1 95 7 and 93 7 for d3000 r3000 and kpt sprinklers respectively these values were higher than the application uniformities of fsps and rsps sprinklers averaged 68 6 and 78 2 reported by li 2016 based on the small sprinkler spacing that allowed more water to overlap and the irrigation test was basically unaffected by wind the average cuh values above the canopy for r3000 and kpt sprinklers were significantly higher than d3000 sprinkler p 0 05 but the difference between the r3000 and kpt sprinklers was non significant p 0 05 this result was consistent with the finding of hills and barragan 1998 on a linear move sprinkler machine additionally the cuh above the canopy exceeded the cuh below the canopy for any sprinkler types irrespective of the growth stage this finding was consistent with the maize results reported by zapata et al 2018 while contrasted with the results of cotton and wheat reported by ayars et al 1991 and li and rao 2000 respectively which might be attributable to the differences in the canopy structure of various crops in this study the differences between the cuh values above and below the canopy of the three sprinklers d3000 r3000 and kpt averaged 4 6 23 7 and 30 4 percentage points and 19 5 43 3 and 54 5 percentage points for v6 and vt stages respectively these results suggested that the canopy had the lowest impact on the cuh below the canopy of d3000 and the highest impact on kpt as the growth stage increased the influence of the canopy on the cuh below the canopy became more significant p 0 05 table 2 however if the cuh above the canopy was small less than 80 the reduction of the cuh below the canopy would be less and conversely greater than 90 the reduction would be greater even though its cuh value below the canopy might be lower than the former similar results have also been reported in previous studies ayars et al 1991 li and rao 2000 3 3 effect of maize growth indices on water distributions plant height ph and leaf area index lai are the two most crucial indicators of crop growth affecting sprinkler irrigation performance ayars et al 1991 sanchez et al 2010 in this study the ph and lai of maize had significantly p 0 01 results not presented negative correlations with the cuh below the canopy this result was contrasted with the relationship between canopy interception and crop growth indices kang et al 2005 zheng et al 2018 wang et al 2020 this finding indicated that crop growth indices were closely related to sprinkler irrigation performance and should be highly considered during the design of irrigation systems during the v6 stage of maize no significant differences existed in ph p 0 05 and lai p 0 05 among d3000 r3000 and kpt sprinklers table 2 the ph and lai values of the three sprinklers averaged 1 1 m and 3 4 respectively both the plant height and leaf area significantly increased p 0 05 with the maize growth at the vt stage the three sprinklers average ph and lai values reached 2 2 m and 6 8 respectively table 2 to further determine the relationships between maize growth indices and cuh values below the canopy fig 5 presents the linear regression equations of ph lai and cuh below the canopy for three sprinkler types and two growth stages of them the r2 values of d3000 r3000 and kpt sprinklers were 0 832 0 844 0 750 and 0 845 0 877 0 749 for the relationships between ph and cuh below the canopy and between lai and cuh below the canopy respectively these results demonstrated that r3000 sprinkler had a stronger correlation of cuh below the canopy with maize growth indices than other two sprinklers however the antithetical result for the relationship between the cuh above and below the canopy was noteworthy fig 4 thus the cuh below the canopy of r3000 sprinkler was mainly dependent on the maize s growth status and minimally affected by the cuh above the canopy meanwhile further analysis showed that the cuh below the canopy of kpt declined fastest with the increase of ph and lai followed by the r3000 and d3000 declined the slowest 3 4 variation of soil water contents with time after sprinkler irrigation after the maize canopy interception a part of irrigation water will infiltrate into the soil and change the swc these changes have been proven to affect many soil processes including microbial biomass activity nutrient uptake by plants and nitrogen cycling van wesenbeeck and kachanoski 1988 to reveal the change in the swc values before and after irrigation table 3 presents the variability of swc values of 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 4 m soil depths at 1 h before 1 h after and 24 h after irrigation for three sprinkler types at v6 and vt stages it was observed that the initial swc values 1 h before irrigation for the 0 0 2 m depth were significantly higher than the 0 2 0 4 m depth p 0 01 results not presented and their difference averaged 2 3 percentage points for each treatment this might have happened due to the upward transportation of soil water affected by the strong evaporation of the soil surface in summer kondo et al 1990 when irrigation was complete swc values significantly increased overall the soil water distribution at the 0 0 2 m depth showed more positive increases at 1 h after irrigation compared to the 0 2 0 4 m depth especially during the vt stage p 0 05 table 3 dukes et al 2006 believed that this result occurred due to the less sensitivity of soil water variability towards the soil depth increase for v6 and vt stages the average swc differences of d3000 r3000 and kpt sprinklers between 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 4 m depths reached 3 9 3 5 and 3 4 percentage points and 5 0 2 0 and 3 2 percentage points respectively this finding indicated that except for the slight decrease in the average swc difference of r3000 during the vt stage all other treatment differences increased compared to the 1 h before irrigation 2 3 percentage points this may be attributed to the deep percolation when equipped with the r3000 sprinkler during the vt stage which resulted in a significant increase in the swc values for the 0 2 0 4 m soil layer p 0 05 table 3 the water distribution in the soil changed steadily following the irrigation at 24 h after irrigation the swc values across all treatments significantly decreased p 0 05 in the 0 0 2 m depth and correspondingly increased in the 0 2 0 4 m depth except the d3000 and kpt treatments at the v6 stage and the r3000 treatment at the vt stage the reduction in swc values at the 0 2 0 4 m depth at 24 h after irrigation might be related to the poor water preserving capability of the lower soil layer at some measuring points for all the three treatments the swc difference between the two depths at 24 h after irrigation averaged 1 8 percentage points which was lower than the average initial swc difference 2 3 percentage points this result suggested that the redistribution of sprinkler water within the soil could effectively improve soil water distribution uniformity ayars et al 1991 li and kawano 1996 although some measured points had opposite results due to deep percolation water losses or soil layers water conductivity it can be confirmed from table 3 that the swc values at the 0 0 2 m soil depth were always higher than the 0 2 0 4 soil depth irrespective of before or after irrigation this finding may be attributed to climatic conditions such as the rainfall before the experiment the upward transport of soil water due to the strong evaporation of soil surface in summer or the sensitivity of the soil moisture to irrigation water decreased with the increase of soil depth dukes et al 2006 3 5 variation of soil water uniformity with time after sprinkler irrigation cuhs closely related to the uniformity of the initial swc and total applied water is a crucial factor for crop yield li and kawano 1996 dukes et al 2006 to analyse the variability of cuhs with the time before and after irrigation table 4 shows the cuhs values at 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 4 m soil depths at 1 h before 1 h after and 24 h after irrigation for three sprinkler types and two growth stages the average values of cuhs under different treatments were above 93 which was a desirable value of the uniformity for sprinkler irrigation projects further analysis indicated that the cuhs before irrigation was non significant from after irrigation p 0 05 even if the actual water contents in the soil increased according to wallach 1990 this observation indicated a dampening effect on the nonuniformity due to the occurrence of infiltration similar results have been reported by li and kawano 1996 for bare soil and by dukes et al 2006 on a turfgrass plot according to an independent sample t test the difference in cuhs between two soil layers of 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 4 m was also nonsignificant p 0 05 results not presented implying that the cuhs was not greatly affected by the soil depth in this study taken together soil water redistribution could effectively improve the cuhs but in the soil with a high initial cuhs the changes in swc had no significant effect on the cuhs to further study the effect of soil water distribution uniformity the correlations between the cuhs values at 1 h after irrigation and their influence factors under different growth stages and soil depths were analysed and depicted in table 5 it was apparent that the swc and cuhs at 1 h before irrigation were significantly correlated p 0 05 with the cuhs at 1 h after irrigation because the initial swc and cuhs values were directly related to soil bulk density and pore distribution which in turn affected the movement of soil water after irrigation this indicated that the cuhs was dependent on the initial soil conditions before irrigation and minimally related to external conditions such as canopy structure and sprinkler application uniformity this result was similar to the findings of li and kawano 1996 and dukes et al 2006 in contrast the relationships between the cuhs at 1 h after irrigation and the swc and cuhs values at 1 h before irrigation were negative under some conditions suggesting that the higher swc and cuhs at 1 h before irrigation might lower down the cuhs at 1 h after irrigation this might have happened as the cuhs at 1 h before irrigation had obtained very high values all above 95 for different treatments table 4 due to the influence of environmental factors such as the rainfall before irrigation therefore the increase of cuhs at 1 h after irrigation was minimal which led to this negative relationship additionally the regression models of cuhs at 1 h after irrigation cuhs 1a were established based on the swc and cuhs data at 1 h before irrigation swc1b and cuhs 1b of the two soil layers obtained during the v6 and vt stages as shown in the following equations 5 for the v6 stage cu hs 1a 24 6 swc 1b 0 62 swc 1b 2 0 06 cu hs 1b 154 61 r 2 0 744 6 for the vt stage cu hs 1a 4 66 swc 1b 0 12 swc 1b 2 0 48 cu hs 1b 2 25 r 2 0 551 3 6 distribution dynamics of irrigation water and soil water under maize canopy generally sprinkler applied water was redistributed twice after spraying first by crop canopy and then by the soil many studies li and kawano 1996 li and rao 2000 dukes et al 2006 have quantified this dynamic process and found that soil water s uniformity was greater than the application uniformity to further investigate this process fig 6 presents the cuh above and below the canopy and at the soil depths of 0 0 2 m and 0 2 0 4 m at 1 h after irrigation for three types of sprinklers overall the cuh below the canopy was significantly lower than above the canopy and within the soil the average cuh values below the canopy of d3000 r3000 and kpt sprinklers were only 73 5 72 0 63 3 and 58 6 52 4 39 2 for v6 and vt stages respectively these findings signified that under a centre pivot system the uniformity of sprinkler irrigation would be significantly reduced by the interception of maize canopy which could be effectively improved due to the subsequent redistribution of soil water this result was consistent with the previous understanding of the role of soil moisture redistribution li and rao 2000 dukes et al 2006 however the effect of crop canopy on sprinkler uniformity differed from the previous results our findings were consistent with the findings of zapata et al 2018 but others found that crop canopy could improve sprinkler irrigation uniformity ayars et al 1991 li and rao 2000 this difference might be attributed to different crop canopy structures planting densities irrigation methods and sprinkler types using the three sprinklers selected in this study as an example under basically uniform experimental conditions the application uniformity of d3000 was least affected by the canopy while that of kpt was most affected as depicted in fig 6 the cuhs values among the three sprinklers were close enough averaging approximately 95 8 although the cuh above the canopy 78 1 of d3000 was significantly lower than r3000 and kpt sprinklers both exceed 90 this result confirmed that the effect of water application uniformity was not important as predicted even for a low cuh above the canopy below 80 the cuhs reached more than 93 after canopy interception and soil water redistribution which was consistent with the results reported by li and kawano 1996 4 summary and conclusions in conclusion the water application depth and cuh above the canopy were significantly higher than below the canopy for d3000 r3000 and kpt sprinklers at v6 and vt stages moreover the differences above and below the canopy significantly increased with the growth of maize as the cuh above the canopy increased the cuh below the canopy of r3000 and kpt sprinklers decreased linearly whereas the change in d3000 was reversed besides the canopy had a minimal impact on the cuh below the canopy of d3000 and the maximum on kpt overall the plant height and leaf area index of maize exhibited significantly negative correlations with the cuh below the canopy although the swc after irrigation increased the difference in cuhs was non significant compared to before irrigation and the average cuhs values of the three sprinklers were above 93 under different irrigation stages this result suggested that the redistribution of soil water could effectively improve cuhs but the changes in swc had no significant effect on the cuhs when the soil had a high initial cuhs the effect of soil water uniformity results proved that cuhs was dependent on the initial swc and cuhs values but minimally related to the plant height leaf area index and sprinkler application uniformity additionally the regression models of cuhs at 1 h after irrigation were established based on the swc and cuhs at 1 h before irrigation to predict the cuhs at 1 h after irrigation the distribution dynamics of irrigation water suggested that the effect of water application uniformity was not important as predicted although the cuh above the canopy 78 1 of d3000 was significantly lower than r3000 and kpt sprinklers both exceeded 90 its cuhs reached more than 93 like other two sprinklers after canopy interception and soil water redistribution this article presents the results obtained from the field experiments conducted with summer maize under a centre pivot irrigation system these results may not necessarily be applicable to other crops or irrigation devices in addition this study did not involve maize s stemflow measurement so further research is deserved declaration of competing interest the authors

10308,soil water content in maize root zone is the main basis of irrigation decision making therefore it is important to predict the soil water content at different depths in maize root zone for rational agricultural irrigation this study proposed a hybrid convolutional neural network gated recurrent unit cnn gru integrated deep learning model that combines a cnn with strong feature expression capacity and a gru neural network with strong memory capacity the model was trained and tested with the soil water content and meteorological data from five representative sites in key maize producing areas shandong province china we designed the model structure and selected the input variables based on a pearson correlation analysis and soil water content autocorrelation analysis the results showed that the hybrid cnn gru model performed better than the independent cnn or gru model with respect to prediction accuracy and convergence rate the average mean squared error mse mean absolute error and root mean squared error of the hybrid cnn gru model on day 3 were 0 91 0 51 and 0 93 respectively the prediction accuracy of the model improved with increasing soil depth extending the forecast period the prediction accuracy values of the hybrid cnn gru model for the soil water content on days 5 7 and 10 were comparable with an average mse of less than 1 0 keywords soil water content cnn gru integrated prediction model maize root zone 1 introduction soil moisture is the main water source for plants especially in agricultural production where proper soil water content in the root zone of the crop plays a decisive role in crop growth and yield quality zhang et al 2018 maize is one of the most abundant food crops worldwide and china produced an average of more than 260 million tons of maize in 2019 with shandong province as the lead producer the irrigation water requirement for summer maize is 250 5 mm making irrigation vital for ensuring crop growth wu et al 2019 predicting the soil water content condition a few days in advance can not only support the farm in planning an appropriate irrigation schedule but can also reduce the impact of meteorological disasters adeyemi et al 2018 however the soil water content is affected by soil characteristics farmland meteorological changes crop growth and other factors showing complex fluctuations it is challenging to determine the soil water content variation accurately and timely therefore efficient algorithms are necessary to deal with the nonlinear complex characteristics with the development of information technology continuous soil and meteorological data can be easily obtained using wireless sensor technology through the accumulation of time series data it is possible to further determine soil water content and build data driven forecasting models in recent years machine learning methods have been widely used to acquire the characteristics of data and describe future change trend traditional machine learning regression algorithms primarily include support vector machine svm decision tree and random forest ding et al 2016 utilized the svm and bacterial foraging optimization algorithm to build a soil water content prediction model in anhui province china hong et al 2016 built a model based on the svm and relevance vector machine in illinois to predict soil water content in the next day on a larger spatial scale liu et al 2017 utilized the levenberg marquardt regression estimation method to optimize the parameters in the prediction model and constructed a prediction model for soil water content and crop evapotranspiration in the north china plain prasad et al 2018 further improved the model algorithm and utilized the extreme learning machine elm model to predict the average soil water content per month in new south wales however traditional machine learning models usually have more restrictions on sample quality and quantity which require more effort in data pre processing and feature extraction in addition due to the significantly different soils in different regions a higher generalization ability of the model is also required compared with traditional machine learning models deep learning models have better data fitting and generalized prediction performance lecun et al 2015 recently a few researchers have applied the deep learning algorithms to the prediction of soil water content for example yang et al 2017 proposed a hybrid model combining discrete wavelet decomposition algorithm bp neural network and particle swarm optimization pso algorithm for predicting soil water content in shandong province china chatterjee et al 2018 utilized the artificial neural network ann optimized using a flower pollination algorithm to build a soil water content prediction model in kolkata india cai et al 2019 combined meteorological and soil water content data as the input variables and used a deep neural network dnnr to build a soil water content prediction model in beijing china however the deep learning models utilized for predicting soil water content in existing studies have been mostly bp neural network or dnn without further considering the feature abstraction of the time series data and the contextual correlation on the time axis therefore it has been difficult to determine the changes in soil water content convolutional neural network cnn was proposed in 1989 lecun 1989 and was initially utilized to solve the problem of image recognition its sparse interactions parameter sharing and equivariant representations allowed cnn to significantly reduce the complexity of the model and improve the computational efficiency in recent years cnn based models have been applied in several fields and are especially suitable for image processing therefore meshes of the soil water content and meteorological time series data can be regarded as images processed by cnn moreover the recurrent neural network rnn can correlate contextual information effectively is suitable for modeling sequence data and has an excellent performance in natural language processing connor et al 1994 the standard rnn structure has been prone to gradient disappearance or gradient explosion when the sequence distance is long to overcome the problems caused by rnn in long distance memory hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 proposed the long short term memory lstm neural network as an improved structure of rnn lstm introduced gate mechanism to update information on the basis of rnn while lstm has a complex structure and high time cost of training and prediction shewalkar 2018 chung et al 2014 further optimized the structure of lstm proposed a neural network based on the gated recurrent unit gru reduced the number of gate control units from 3 to 2 in the original lstm and simplified the calculation amount of lstm fu et al 2016 gru based model can selectively store and transfer historical information from the time series data of soil water content and meteorological in recent days in other research fields a slice of researches had built the pm2 5 prediction models by combining the cnn and rnn models qin et al 2019 li et al 2020 the results showed better performance when combining the characteristics of cnn and rnn in this study we proposed a hybrid cnn gru soil water content prediction model adapted to multi scale spatiotemporal characteristics the model was designed to improve the prediction accuracy and generalization ability by integrating the feature expression ability of cnn with the advantage of time series memory of gru the main objectives of this study were 1 to establish the structure and parameters of the hybrid cnn gru model 2 to study the effects of meteorological parameters on the soil water content variation and select the key input variables for the prediction model 3 to evaluate the calculation performance of the model at different depths and the prediction ability for different periods 2 methodology 2 1 hybrid cnn gru model we proposed a combined deep learning prediction model hybrid cnn gru that preserves the advantages of both in feature extraction and time series data mining fig 1a shows the network structure of the hybrid cnn gru model the original meteorological and soil water content data were combined and converted to a specific format then we constructed the individual learners based on cnn and gru and spliced the output of the individual learner in parallel as the input of the meta learner which was composed of fully connected neural networks considering the simplicity balance and nonlinearity of the model architecture we built three dense layers into the meta learner with 128 64 and 32 neurons respectively 1 cnn based individual learner considering the complexity of soil water content data and the extraction capability of cnn the 2d cnn was utilized as the network structure to ensure prediction stability of the prediction effect the feature expression capability of the 2d cnn was conducive to the automatic extraction of common features at different levels of high dimensional time series data chang and sha 2016 we transformed the data into grids along the time axis to utilize the cnn for time series data processing the soil water content and meteorological data with n dimensional attributes on the most recent l dates were expanded and transformed into grids fig 1b the amounts of soil water content and meteorological grid data were much smaller than those of the other application scenarios therefore we referred to the research of the simplified deep cnn architecture springenberg et al 2014 which connected two layers of repeated convolution layers after the input layer so as to extract the high level features as early as possible with fewer network layers and avoided losing the important features when passing through the pooling layer after consecutive convolution layers and pooling layer the model flattened the obtained features into one dimension and the data was entered to the dense layers at last fig 1c the dimension of soil water content and meteorological grid data were not higher than that of image data therefore the 3 3 convolution kernel size and the maximum pooling function for the pooling layer was selected the number of neurons in the dense layers were set to 128 64 and 32 respectively as an activation function rectified linear unit relu had the sparse activation characteristic to avoid the occurrence of overfitting the mathematical expression is as follows 1 f x max 0 x moreover the spatialdropout operation was performed after the convolutional layers to discard 10 of the feature graph in the second convolutional layer the setting of main parameters are shown in table 1 2 gru based individual learner the soil water content prediction required not only to determine the change trend accurately but also to obtain the daily soil water content contents within a time range therefore the model adopted two layer gru structure to take two recurrent unit expansion forms of one to one and many to one which made the model produce a new memory state for the input time series data at each time step and update the memory at the last time step fig 1d shows the model structure of the individual learner based on gru the implementation method of the model was as follows 1 the data were entered to the expanded gru layer in one to one form the output of the first gru layer was a sequence with the same length as the input and the memory state of each time step had been updated 2 the output sequence of the first gru layer was entered to the second gru layer in many to one form 3 the output of the second gru layer was entered to the dense layers after the dropout superposing the two gru layers was to predict at each time step and then to predict the trend in the preliminary prediction sequence to help the model learn a higher level of time domain feature expression huang et al 2019 table 2 shows the parameter settings of the gru based individual learner the number of neurons in the two gru layers was both set to 128 and the number of neurons in the dense layer were set to 128 64 and 32 respectively the network layers were connected by stacking 2 2 early stopping the early stopping method was utilized to terminate the model training and obtain the best model weight values to achieve better generalization performance and avoid overfitting the implementation steps were as follows 1 the original training data set was divided into a training set and validation set 2 the model was trained only on the training set and the prediction accuracy of each epoch for the validation set was evaluated 3 the training was stopped when the score of the loss function had increased for n consecutive epochs and 4 the model weight values with the best performance were utilized we set mse as the loss function and 200 epochs as n meanwhile we set a timer in the code to record the time and training epochs which provided a reference for evaluating the model fitting performance of the model 2 3 performance evaluation measures four evaluation measures were selected to indicate the performance of the different models the mean absolute error mae 2 m a e 1 m i 1 m y i y i the mean squared error mse 3 m s e 1 m i 1 m y i y i 2 the root mean

the average value mae can reflect the actual situation of the predicted value error mse is the expected value of the square of the difference between the estimated and the observed value it can evaluate the degree of the data change and the smaller value of the mse the better accuracy of the prediction model rmse is the arithmetic square root of mse r2 can eliminate the influence of dimension on the evaluation measure 3 data source and processings 3 1 study area and data acquisition the study area of this study is shandong province of china 114 47 5 122 42 3 e 34 22 9 38 24 01 n which is of warm temperate monsoon climate type taking into account soil weather and maize planting distribution the annual average temperature is 11 14 the frost free period lasts for 180 220 d and the annual average precipitation is 550 950 mm with 2290 2890 annual average sunshine hours the data source used was the national soil moisture monitoring system http www soilmoisture org cn five typical stations tai an station qingdao station liaocheng station heze station and weifang station with different length from 2012 to 2019 were selected for the model training and testing fig 2 shows the station distribution and the selected station location covers the main maize production area of shandong province the original data contained two parts meteorological data and soil water content data the type of soil water content is volume water content the time frequency of data sampling was 1 h 3 2 data processing and analysis the meteorological and soil water content data were processed from hourly values to daily averages excepting the daily precipitation was the sum in one day in the nutritional stage of maize the root system absorbed the maximum water in the 10 30 cm layer whereas it absorbs the most in the 20 70 cm layer in the reproductive stage with an overall contribution of 43 21 55 48 from these two sections li et al 2015 therefore the soil water content at 0 80 cm soil depth was selected for the study table 3 shows the abbreviations units and explanations of each variable in addition to adapt to the growth stage of maize the data of each site from march 1 to october 31 of each year was selected in this study which covered the planting period of spring maize summer maize and autumn maize in shandong province the data set contains 3234 daily meteorological and soil water content data fig 3 shows the soil water content data at four soil depths of the liaocheng station in 2018 the soil water content fluctuated with maize growing due to the irrigation or rain events the peak process was consistent in some point such as in the end of april and june however the soil water content values and growth decline rates were different in terms of variation amplitude the fluctuation of soil water content at the depth of 0 20 cm was more intense while the temporal variations at other depths were relatively small table 4 shows the maximum value max minimum value min average value avg and standard deviation sd of soil water content data at different soil depths the observed value of soil water content at different soil depths is in the range of 10 50 as the depth increased the average value increased gradually and the standard deviation decreased from shallow to deep soil depths the differences in soil water content data at different soil depths is significant which also increases difficulty in forecasting for partitioning of the data set data from five sites were utilized for the model training evaluation and testing by random selection 80 of the data were used for model training and 20 for testing where 20 of the data used for model training were randomly selected as the validation dataset evaluating the fit of the model in addition data normalization could improve the prediction accuracy and the fitting speed of model accordingly the min max normalization method was utilized to process each feature variable expressed as 6 x norm x 0 x min x max x min where x norm x 0 x min and x max are the normalized real minimum and maximum values respectively the training environment of the model was a graphics workstation which was configured with cpu intel r xeon r cpu e5 1620 v4 3 50 ghz gpu nvidia quadro k2200 and ram 32 gb the anaconda platform was adopted as the basic platform for deep learning training keras was the deep learning framework tensorflow 1 13 was the backend and cuda technology was used to realize parallel computing the python version was 3 7 4 results 4 1 analysis of model input variables fig 4 shows the pearson correlation analysis and two tail significance test results of soil water content meteorological and site coordinate data the correlation coefficients between daily precipitation and soil water content at depths of 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm were approximately zero and not significantly correlated at the level of 0 05 the same result was found in daily solar radiation therefore the daily precipitation and daily solar radiation were not suitable as input variables for model construction the other indicators were significant with correlation coefficients higher than 0 2 which was suitable for the modeling variables notably the correlation coefficient between longitude and soil water content at 20 40 cm depth was 0 656 which reflects the influence of spatial location differences finally nine indicators swc20 swc40 swc60 swc80 t rh u2 lat and lng were selected as the model input variables meteorological and soil water content data from the previous few days were utilized to predict the future soil water content as shown in fig 4 the correlation coefficients among soil water content at different depths were relatively high which requires further analysis of the autocorrelation of soil water content with different days delay fig 5 shows the autocorrelation analysis results for different soil depths the autocorrelation coefficients of soil water content at different depths decreased as delaying days the change range of 0 20 cm depth was more significant which reduced from 0 963 to 0 573 while the decline range of 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 80 cm depths were relatively small which reduced from 0 984 to 0 775 the matrix composed of nearly 8 continuous data was planned to be utilized as the inputs variables and the correlation coefficients of soil water content at different depths were more than 0 7 with a delay of 1 8 days therefore the input was a 9 8 matrix and the output was a 4 1 matrix 4 2 comparison of model training efficiency to compare the performance of the integrated model the individual learners based on cnn and gru were considered as independent models each model was trained three times using the early stopping method fig 6 shows the number of training epochs and training time the average training epochs of the cnn gru and hybrid cnn gru models were 1941 3391 and 1600 respectively the average training time of cnn gru and hybrid cnn gru models were 181s 690s and 370s respectively the hybrid cnn gru model required the fewest training iterations whereas the gru based model required the more training time and epochs 4 3 comparison of forecasting accuracy after the training the models were tested using the test data set and the prediction accuracy of each model at different depths was evaluated by comparing the observed values fig 7 shows the goodness of fit of the cnn based gru based and hybrid cnn gru models for predicting soil water content at different depths the overall goodness of fit r2 scores of the three models at different soil depths were larger than 0 90 except for the cnn model at 0 20 cm r2 0 841 the descending order of average r2 was hybrid cnn gru gru cnn with the increase of soil depth the fitting abilities of the three models were improved by varying degrees the highest r2 score of 0 97 was produced by the hybrid cnn gru model at the depth of 60 80 cm fig 8 shows the residual analysis results of the predicted values of different models it showed that the prediction residuals of the three models at different depths were all clustered around the zero value line with normal randomness and most residuals were within 2 2 comparing the different models the residual distributions of the hybrid cnn gru model at different depths were more clustered around the zero value line than the other two models with the increase of depth the aggregation degrees of the three models to the zero value line were improved the predicted residuals at depths of 60 80 cm displayed the best aggregation to the zero value line within 4 842 2 783 table 5 shows the prediction accuracy analysis results of three models at different depths for the mse mae and rmse indices the cnn based model were within 1 35 3 82 0 71 1 11 and 1 16 1 95 the gru based model were within 0 61 2 08 0 46 0 76 and 0 78 1 44 the hybrid cnn gru model were within 0 47 1 52 0 39 0 69 and 0 69 1 23 respectively there were obvious differences in prediction accuracy among different models and the hybrid cnn gru model performed the best with the average mse mae and rmse values of 0 91 0 51 and 0 93 respectively 4 4 comparison of forecasting extensibility table 6 shows that the prediction accuracy analysis results of the hybrid cnn gru model on days 5 7 and 10 were comparable with the maximum difference in the average mae of 0 05 from the prediction results at different depths the prediction accuracy at 0 20 cm depth was lower than that of the deeper layers in the different forecasting periods the overall trend also showed that the higher prediction accuracy obtained in the deeper soil depths the prediction error trend of other depths is similar to that of the surface soil in addition the prediction results of the hybrid cnn gru model for different delay days show that the average r2 scores of the predicted values and the observed values were over 0 9 and the mae were less than 1 5 discussion an accurate prediction of soil water content at different depths for the following days is of great significance for agricultural irrigation and conservation through the pearson correlation analysis and significance test 9 indices swc20 swc40 swc60 swc80 t rh u2 lat lng were selected as the input variables of the model although precipitation can directly affect the surface soil water content the correlation coefficient between daily precipitation and the 0 20 cm soil water content is only 0 126 this was because the annual average precipitation of shandong province is approximately 675 mm but the average value of single effective precipitation is only 2 7 mm moreover 59 6 of the effective precipitation was less than 1 mm and the effect of small amounts of precipitation on soil water content is not significant yoo et al 1998 in related research cai et al 2019 analyzed the input variables of the soil water content prediction model in beijing similar to the current study the pearson correlation coefficient between the daily precipitation and the surface soil water content was also only 0 17 in addition through the autocorrelation analysis of soil water content at different depths the data of 8 consecutive days were selected to build the input data grid this is consistent with the research conclusion of li et al 2020 using a cnn lstm model to predict pm2 5 according to the prediction results of soil water content on day 3 the hybrid cnn gru model was superior to the independent cnn based and gru based models in terms of prediction accuracy and convergence rate this result illustrates that by combining the high dimensional feature extraction ability of cnn and the time series memory ability of gru the fitting ability of model applied in the complex data processing could be improved studies from other research fields have also shown that models built by combining cnn and gru could provide better prediction performance wang et al 2018 built the dualconvgru model to predict snoring and xiaofeng et al 2019 built keyboard input prediction model by stacking the cnn and gru gessert et al 2018 constructed the fused convgru cnn structure to predict the tip pressure these studies have reached similar conclusions with the current study in addition the prediction accuracy of the hybrid cnn gru model for 0 20 cm surface soil water content was significantly lower than that at depth of 20 80 cm showing a trend of improving prediction accuracy with the increase of soil depth it was due to the more active evapotranspiration of surface soil resulting in greater variability the study on the vertical variability of soil water content in farmland showed that the variability of soil water gradually decreases with the increase of soil depth which was consistent with the results of this study alun et al 2012 we found that the prediction accuracy of the hybrid cnn gru model for soil water content on days 5 7 and 10 was comparable which may be due to the close autocorrelation coefficient between the current and the following 5 10 days fig 5 however the prediction accuracy for a longer time in the future was lower than that for the day 3 which was also consistent with the performance in which the autocorrelation of soil water content gradually decreased with the longer forecasting periods fig 5 to better evaluate the prediction accuracy of the hybrid cnn gru model we constructed and compared the deep learning models mentioned in the introduction such as dnnr cai et al 2019 cnn lstm1 qin et al 2019 and cnn lstm2 li et al 2020 we also further compared other commonly used machine learning models such as artificial neural network ann antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 support vector regression svr fan et al 2018 k nearest neighbor knn peterson 2009 and random forest liaw and wiener 2002 the comparison results of the model prediction accuracy are shown in table 7 where each error indicator mse mae and mse is the average value of the metric for different depth predictions from the prediction accuracy of the validation and test sets it can be seen that the prediction accuracy of the hybrid cnn gru model proposed in this study is better than the other models we discussed the data fitting ability of the hybrid cnn gru model to further verify the generalized prediction ability of the trained hybrid cnn gru model to the non modeling sites we selected the data from pingdu station as the test data this site did not participate in the construction of the model and its geographical location is far away from the five modeling sites table 8 shows the prediction accuracy results of the generalization test the average mae was less than 0 93 fig 9 further shows the comparison curve between the predicted value and the observed value of soil water content at different depths the fluctuations in the predicted water content of the surface soil 0 20 cm are violent while the curve tends to be gentle with the increase of soil depth this may be due to the fluctuation range and variance in the surface soil water content being higher than those at greater soil depths table 4 the advantage of the hybrid cnn gru model proposed in this study is that it achieves better accuracy in predicting soil water content than other mainstream models by extracting high dimensional and time series features of the data however the soil is susceptible to rainfall or irrigation so it is difficult to predict the process of soil moisture content increase in addition the dataset validated for the model has limitations in terms of data volume weather forecasting and site distribution further research can be carried out in the future 1 to enrich the number of sites and data volume utilized for model training 2 to improve the fitting accuracy and generalization ability of the model by increasing more input parameters such as soil texture and bulk density and 3 to optimize the model structure and parameters to improve the fitting and generalized prediction ability 6 conclusions in this study we proposed a hybrid cnn gru model for predicting soil water content at different depths in the maize root zone which integrated the strong feature expression ability of cnn and the time series feature memory ability of gru the individual learners based on cnn and gru were integrated in parallel the output of the individual learners was concatenated as input to the meta learner for further training to obtain the final prediction results the meteorological and soil water content data of five typical sites in the primary maize production areas of shandong province were utilized as modeling data 80 of which were utilized for model training and validation and 20 for model testing according to the pearson correlation analysis of each characteristic variable and the autocorrelation analysis of the soil water content data nine indices swc20 swc40 swc60 swc80 t rh u2 lat and lng were selected as model input variables and the data of continuous 8 days were gridded as model input the results showed that the hybrid cnn gru model was superior to the cnn based and gru based individual learners in terms of prediction accuracy and convergence rate and the overall prediction accuracy improved with the increase of the soil depth furthermore we extended the forecast period the prediction accuracy of the hybrid cnn gru model for soil water content on days 5 7 and 10 were similar with an average mse of less than 1 0 in addition the hybrid cnn gru model also obtained a satisfactory generalized prediction performance in conclusion the hybrid cnn gru model achieved exceptional performance in soil water content prediction at different depths in the maize root zone and the research on the hybrid cnn gru model could

10308,soil water content in maize root zone is the main basis of irrigation decision making therefore it is important to predict the soil water content at different depths in maize root zone for rational agricultural irrigation this study proposed a hybrid convolutional neural network gated recurrent unit cnn gru integrated deep learning model that combines a cnn with strong feature expression capacity and a gru neural network with strong memory capacity the model was trained and tested with the soil water content and meteorological data from five representative sites in key maize producing areas shandong province china we designed the model structure and selected the input variables based on a pearson correlation analysis and soil water content autocorrelation analysis the results showed that the hybrid cnn gru model performed better than the independent cnn or gru model with respect to prediction accuracy and convergence rate the average mean squared error mse mean absolute error and root mean squared error of the hybrid cnn gru model on day 3 were 0 91 0 51 and 0 93 respectively the prediction accuracy of the model improved with increasing soil depth extending the forecast period the prediction accuracy values of the hybrid cnn gru model for the soil water content on days 5 7 and 10 were comparable with an average mse of less than 1 0 keywords soil water content cnn gru integrated prediction model maize root zone 1 introduction soil moisture is the main water source for plants especially in agricultural production where proper soil water content in the root zone of the crop plays a decisive role in crop growth and yield quality zhang et al 2018 maize is one of the most abundant food crops worldwide and china produced an average of more than 260 million tons of maize in 2019 with shandong province as the lead producer the irrigation water requirement for summer maize is 250 5 mm making irrigation vital for ensuring crop growth wu et al 2019 predicting the soil water content condition a few days in advance can not only support the farm in planning an appropriate irrigation schedule but can also reduce the impact of meteorological disasters adeyemi et al 2018 however the soil water content is affected by soil characteristics farmland meteorological changes crop growth and other factors showing complex fluctuations it is challenging to determine the soil water content variation accurately and timely therefore efficient algorithms are necessary to deal with the nonlinear complex characteristics with the development of information technology continuous soil and meteorological data can be easily obtained using wireless sensor technology through the accumulation of time series data it is possible to further determine soil water content and build data driven forecasting models in recent years machine learning methods have been widely used to acquire the characteristics of data and describe future change trend traditional machine learning regression algorithms primarily include support vector machine svm decision tree and random forest ding et al 2016 utilized the svm and bacterial foraging optimization algorithm to build a soil water content prediction model in anhui province china hong et al 2016 built a model based on the svm and relevance vector machine in illinois to predict soil water content in the next day on a larger spatial scale liu et al 2017 utilized the levenberg marquardt regression estimation method to optimize the parameters in the prediction model and constructed a prediction model for soil water content and crop evapotranspiration in the north china plain prasad et al 2018 further improved the model algorithm and utilized the extreme learning machine elm model to predict the average soil water content per month in new south wales however traditional machine learning models usually have more restrictions on sample quality and quantity which require more effort in data pre processing and feature extraction in addition due to the significantly different soils in different regions a higher generalization ability of the model is also required compared with traditional machine learning models deep learning models have better data fitting and generalized prediction performance lecun et al 2015 recently a few researchers have applied the deep learning algorithms to the prediction of soil water content for example yang et al 2017 proposed a hybrid model combining discrete wavelet decomposition algorithm bp neural network and particle swarm optimization pso algorithm for predicting soil water content in shandong province china chatterjee et al 2018 utilized the artificial neural network ann optimized using a flower pollination algorithm to build a soil water content prediction model in kolkata india cai et al 2019 combined meteorological and soil water content data as the input variables and used a deep neural network dnnr to build a soil water content prediction model in beijing china however the deep learning models utilized for predicting soil water content in existing studies have been mostly bp neural network or dnn without further considering the feature abstraction of the time series data and the contextual correlation on the time axis therefore it has been difficult to determine the changes in soil water content convolutional neural network cnn was proposed in 1989 lecun 1989 and was initially utilized to solve the problem of image recognition its sparse interactions parameter sharing and equivariant representations allowed cnn to significantly reduce the complexity of the model and improve the computational efficiency in recent years cnn based models have been applied in several fields and are especially suitable for image processing therefore meshes of the soil water content and meteorological time series data can be regarded as images processed by cnn moreover the recurrent neural network rnn can correlate contextual information effectively is suitable for modeling sequence data and has an excellent performance in natural language processing connor et al 1994 the standard rnn structure has been prone to gradient disappearance or gradient explosion when the sequence distance is long to overcome the problems caused by rnn in long distance memory hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 proposed the long short term memory lstm neural network as an improved structure of rnn lstm introduced gate mechanism to update information on the basis of rnn while lstm has a complex structure and high time cost of training and prediction shewalkar 2018 chung et al 2014 further optimized the structure of lstm proposed a neural network based on the gated recurrent unit gru reduced the number of gate control units from 3 to 2 in the original lstm and simplified the calculation amount of lstm fu et al 2016 gru based model can selectively store and transfer historical information from the time series data of soil water content and meteorological in recent days in other research fields a slice of researches had built the pm2 5 prediction models by combining the cnn and rnn models qin et al 2019 li et al 2020 the results showed better performance when combining the characteristics of cnn and rnn in this study we proposed a hybrid cnn gru soil water content prediction model adapted to multi scale spatiotemporal characteristics the model was designed to improve the prediction accuracy and generalization ability by integrating the feature expression ability of cnn with the advantage of time series memory of gru the main objectives of this study were 1 to establish the structure and parameters of the hybrid cnn gru model 2 to study the effects of meteorological parameters on the soil water content variation and select the key input variables for the prediction model 3 to evaluate the calculation performance of the model at different depths and the prediction ability for different periods 2 methodology 2 1 hybrid cnn gru model we proposed a combined deep learning prediction model hybrid cnn gru that preserves the advantages of both in feature extraction and time series data mining fig 1a shows the network structure of the hybrid cnn gru model the original meteorological and soil water content data were combined and converted to a specific format then we constructed the individual learners based on cnn and gru and spliced the output of the individual learner in parallel as the input of the meta learner which was composed of fully connected neural networks considering the simplicity balance and nonlinearity of the model architecture we built three dense layers into the meta learner with 128 64 and 32 neurons respectively 1 cnn based individual learner considering the complexity of soil water content data and the extraction capability of cnn the 2d cnn was utilized as the network structure to ensure prediction stability of the prediction effect the feature expression capability of the 2d cnn was conducive to the automatic extraction of common features at different levels of high dimensional time series data chang and sha 2016 we transformed the data into grids along the time axis to utilize the cnn for time series data processing the soil water content and meteorological data with n dimensional attributes on the most recent l dates were expanded and transformed into grids fig 1b the amounts of soil water content and meteorological grid data were much smaller than those of the other application scenarios therefore we referred to the research of the simplified deep cnn architecture springenberg et al 2014 which connected two layers of repeated convolution layers after the input layer so as to extract the high level features as early as possible with fewer network layers and avoided losing the important features when passing through the pooling layer after consecutive convolution layers and pooling layer the model flattened the obtained features into one dimension and the data was entered to the dense layers at last fig 1c the dimension of soil water content and meteorological grid data were not higher than that of image data therefore the 3 3 convolution kernel size and the maximum pooling function for the pooling layer was selected the number of neurons in the dense layers were set to 128 64 and 32 respectively as an activation function rectified linear unit relu had the sparse activation characteristic to avoid the occurrence of overfitting the mathematical expression is as follows 1 f x max 0 x moreover the spatialdropout operation was performed after the convolutional layers to discard 10 of the feature graph in the second convolutional layer the setting of main parameters are shown in table 1 2 gru based individual learner the soil water content prediction required not only to determine the change trend accurately but also to obtain the daily soil water content contents within a time range therefore the model adopted two layer gru structure to take two recurrent unit expansion forms of one to one and many to one which made the model produce a new memory state for the input time series data at each time step and update the memory at the last time step fig 1d shows the model structure of the individual learner based on gru the implementation method of the model was as follows 1 the data were entered to the expanded gru layer in one to one form the output of the first gru layer was a sequence with the same length as the input and the memory state of each time step had been updated 2 the output sequence of the first gru layer was entered to the second gru layer in many to one form 3 the output of the second gru layer was entered to the dense layers after the dropout superposing the two gru layers was to predict at each time step and then to predict the trend in the preliminary prediction sequence to help the model learn a higher level of time domain feature expression huang et al 2019 table 2 shows the parameter settings of the gru based individual learner the number of neurons in the two gru layers was both set to 128 and the number of neurons in the dense layer were set to 128 64 and 32 respectively the network layers were connected by stacking 2 2 early stopping the early stopping method was utilized to terminate the model training and obtain the best model weight values to achieve better generalization performance and avoid overfitting the implementation steps were as follows 1 the original training data set was divided into a training set and validation set 2 the model was trained only on the training set and the prediction accuracy of each epoch for the validation set was evaluated 3 the training was stopped when the score of the loss function had increased for n consecutive epochs and 4 the model weight values with the best performance were utilized we set mse as the loss function and 200 epochs as n meanwhile we set a timer in the code to record the time and training epochs which provided a reference for evaluating the model fitting performance of the model 2 3 performance evaluation measures four evaluation measures were selected to indicate the performance of the different models the mean absolute error mae 2 m a e 1 m i 1 m y i y i the mean squared error mse 3 m s e 1 m i 1 m y i y i 2 the root mean

the average value mae can reflect the actual situation of the predicted value error mse is the expected value of the square of the difference between the estimated and the observed value it can evaluate the degree of the data change and the smaller value of the mse the better accuracy of the prediction model rmse is the arithmetic square root of mse r2 can eliminate the influence of dimension on the evaluation measure 3 data source and processings 3 1 study area and data acquisition the study area of this study is shandong province of china 114 47 5 122 42 3 e 34 22 9 38 24 01 n which is of warm temperate monsoon climate type taking into account soil weather and maize planting distribution the annual average temperature is 11 14 the frost free period lasts for 180 220 d and the annual average precipitation is 550 950 mm with 2290 2890 annual average sunshine hours the data source used was the national soil moisture monitoring system http www soilmoisture org cn five typical stations tai an station qingdao station liaocheng station heze station and weifang station with different length from 2012 to 2019 were selected for the model training and testing fig 2 shows the station distribution and the selected station location covers the main maize production area of shandong province the original data contained two parts meteorological data and soil water content data the type of soil water content is volume water content the time frequency of data sampling was 1 h 3 2 data processing and analysis the meteorological and soil water content data were processed from hourly values to daily averages excepting the daily precipitation was the sum in one day in the nutritional stage of maize the root system absorbed the maximum water in the 10 30 cm layer whereas it absorbs the most in the 20 70 cm layer in the reproductive stage with an overall contribution of 43 21 55 48 from these two sections li et al 2015 therefore the soil water content at 0 80 cm soil depth was selected for the study table 3 shows the abbreviations units and explanations of each variable in addition to adapt to the growth stage of maize the data of each site from march 1 to october 31 of each year was selected in this study which covered the planting period of spring maize summer maize and autumn maize in shandong province the data set contains 3234 daily meteorological and soil water content data fig 3 shows the soil water content data at four soil depths of the liaocheng station in 2018 the soil water content fluctuated with maize growing due to the irrigation or rain events the peak process was consistent in some point such as in the end of april and june however the soil water content values and growth decline rates were different in terms of variation amplitude the fluctuation of soil water content at the depth of 0 20 cm was more intense while the temporal variations at other depths were relatively small table 4 shows the maximum value max minimum value min average value avg and standard deviation sd of soil water content data at different soil depths the observed value of soil water content at different soil depths is in the range of 10 50 as the depth increased the average value increased gradually and the standard deviation decreased from shallow to deep soil depths the differences in soil water content data at different soil depths is significant which also increases difficulty in forecasting for partitioning of the data set data from five sites were utilized for the model training evaluation and testing by random selection 80 of the data were used for model training and 20 for testing where 20 of the data used for model training were randomly selected as the validation dataset evaluating the fit of the model in addition data normalization could improve the prediction accuracy and the fitting speed of model accordingly the min max normalization method was utilized to process each feature variable expressed as 6 x norm x 0 x min x max x min where x norm x 0 x min and x max are the normalized real minimum and maximum values respectively the training environment of the model was a graphics workstation which was configured with cpu intel r xeon r cpu e5 1620 v4 3 50 ghz gpu nvidia quadro k2200 and ram 32 gb the anaconda platform was adopted as the basic platform for deep learning training keras was the deep learning framework tensorflow 1 13 was the backend and cuda technology was used to realize parallel computing the python version was 3 7 4 results 4 1 analysis of model input variables fig 4 shows the pearson correlation analysis and two tail significance test results of soil water content meteorological and site coordinate data the correlation coefficients between daily precipitation and soil water content at depths of 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm were approximately zero and not significantly correlated at the level of 0 05 the same result was found in daily solar radiation therefore the daily precipitation and daily solar radiation were not suitable as input variables for model construction the other indicators were significant with correlation coefficients higher than 0 2 which was suitable for the modeling variables notably the correlation coefficient between longitude and soil water content at 20 40 cm depth was 0 656 which reflects the influence of spatial location differences finally nine indicators swc20 swc40 swc60 swc80 t rh u2 lat and lng were selected as the model input variables meteorological and soil water content data from the previous few days were utilized to predict the future soil water content as shown in fig 4 the correlation coefficients among soil water content at different depths were relatively high which requires further analysis of the autocorrelation of soil water content with different days delay fig 5 shows the autocorrelation analysis results for different soil depths the autocorrelation coefficients of soil water content at different depths decreased as delaying days the change range of 0 20 cm depth was more significant which reduced from 0 963 to 0 573 while the decline range of 20 40 cm 40 60 cm and 60 80 cm depths were relatively small which reduced from 0 984 to 0 775 the matrix composed of nearly 8 continuous data was planned to be utilized as the inputs variables and the correlation coefficients of soil water content at different depths were more than 0 7 with a delay of 1 8 days therefore the input was a 9 8 matrix and the output was a 4 1 matrix 4 2 comparison of model training efficiency to compare the performance of the integrated model the individual learners based on cnn and gru were considered as independent models each model was trained three times using the early stopping method fig 6 shows the number of training epochs and training time the average training epochs of the cnn gru and hybrid cnn gru models were 1941 3391 and 1600 respectively the average training time of cnn gru and hybrid cnn gru models were 181s 690s and 370s respectively the hybrid cnn gru model required the fewest training iterations whereas the gru based model required the more training time and epochs 4 3 comparison of forecasting accuracy after the training the models were tested using the test data set and the prediction accuracy of each model at different depths was evaluated by comparing the observed values fig 7 shows the goodness of fit of the cnn based gru based and hybrid cnn gru models for predicting soil water content at different depths the overall goodness of fit r2 scores of the three models at different soil depths were larger than 0 90 except for the cnn model at 0 20 cm r2 0 841 the descending order of average r2 was hybrid cnn gru gru cnn with the increase of soil depth the fitting abilities of the three models were improved by varying degrees the highest r2 score of 0 97 was produced by the hybrid cnn gru model at the depth of 60 80 cm fig 8 shows the residual analysis results of the predicted values of different models it showed that the prediction residuals of the three models at different depths were all clustered around the zero value line with normal randomness and most residuals were within 2 2 comparing the different models the residual distributions of the hybrid cnn gru model at different depths were more clustered around the zero value line than the other two models with the increase of depth the aggregation degrees of the three models to the zero value line were improved the predicted residuals at depths of 60 80 cm displayed the best aggregation to the zero value line within 4 842 2 783 table 5 shows the prediction accuracy analysis results of three models at different depths for the mse mae and rmse indices the cnn based model were within 1 35 3 82 0 71 1 11 and 1 16 1 95 the gru based model were within 0 61 2 08 0 46 0 76 and 0 78 1 44 the hybrid cnn gru model were within 0 47 1 52 0 39 0 69 and 0 69 1 23 respectively there were obvious differences in prediction accuracy among different models and the hybrid cnn gru model performed the best with the average mse mae and rmse values of 0 91 0 51 and 0 93 respectively 4 4 comparison of forecasting extensibility table 6 shows that the prediction accuracy analysis results of the hybrid cnn gru model on days 5 7 and 10 were comparable with the maximum difference in the average mae of 0 05 from the prediction results at different depths the prediction accuracy at 0 20 cm depth was lower than that of the deeper layers in the different forecasting periods the overall trend also showed that the higher prediction accuracy obtained in the deeper soil depths the prediction error trend of other depths is similar to that of the surface soil in addition the prediction results of the hybrid cnn gru model for different delay days show that the average r2 scores of the predicted values and the observed values were over 0 9 and the mae were less than 1 5 discussion an accurate prediction of soil water content at different depths for the following days is of great significance for agricultural irrigation and conservation through the pearson correlation analysis and significance test 9 indices swc20 swc40 swc60 swc80 t rh u2 lat lng were selected as the input variables of the model although precipitation can directly affect the surface soil water content the correlation coefficient between daily precipitation and the 0 20 cm soil water content is only 0 126 this was because the annual average precipitation of shandong province is approximately 675 mm but the average value of single effective precipitation is only 2 7 mm moreover 59 6 of the effective precipitation was less than 1 mm and the effect of small amounts of precipitation on soil water content is not significant yoo et al 1998 in related research cai et al 2019 analyzed the input variables of the soil water content prediction model in beijing similar to the current study the pearson correlation coefficient between the daily precipitation and the surface soil water content was also only 0 17 in addition through the autocorrelation analysis of soil water content at different depths the data of 8 consecutive days were selected to build the input data grid this is consistent with the research conclusion of li et al 2020 using a cnn lstm model to predict pm2 5 according to the prediction results of soil water content on day 3 the hybrid cnn gru model was superior to the independent cnn based and gru based models in terms of prediction accuracy and convergence rate this result illustrates that by combining the high dimensional feature extraction ability of cnn and the time series memory ability of gru the fitting ability of model applied in the complex data processing could be improved studies from other research fields have also shown that models built by combining cnn and gru could provide better prediction performance wang et al 2018 built the dualconvgru model to predict snoring and xiaofeng et al 2019 built keyboard input prediction model by stacking the cnn and gru gessert et al 2018 constructed the fused convgru cnn structure to predict the tip pressure these studies have reached similar conclusions with the current study in addition the prediction accuracy of the hybrid cnn gru model for 0 20 cm surface soil water content was significantly lower than that at depth of 20 80 cm showing a trend of improving prediction accuracy with the increase of soil depth it was due to the more active evapotranspiration of surface soil resulting in greater variability the study on the vertical variability of soil water content in farmland showed that the variability of soil water gradually decreases with the increase of soil depth which was consistent with the results of this study alun et al 2012 we found that the prediction accuracy of the hybrid cnn gru model for soil water content on days 5 7 and 10 was comparable which may be due to the close autocorrelation coefficient between the current and the following 5 10 days fig 5 however the prediction accuracy for a longer time in the future was lower than that for the day 3 which was also consistent with the performance in which the autocorrelation of soil water content gradually decreased with the longer forecasting periods fig 5 to better evaluate the prediction accuracy of the hybrid cnn gru model we constructed and compared the deep learning models mentioned in the introduction such as dnnr cai et al 2019 cnn lstm1 qin et al 2019 and cnn lstm2 li et al 2020 we also further compared other commonly used machine learning models such as artificial neural network ann antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 support vector regression svr fan et al 2018 k nearest neighbor knn peterson 2009 and random forest liaw and wiener 2002 the comparison results of the model prediction accuracy are shown in table 7 where each error indicator mse mae and mse is the average value of the metric for different depth predictions from the prediction accuracy of the validation and test sets it can be seen that the prediction accuracy of the hybrid cnn gru model proposed in this study is better than the other models we discussed the data fitting ability of the hybrid cnn gru model to further verify the generalized prediction ability of the trained hybrid cnn gru model to the non modeling sites we selected the data from pingdu station as the test data this site did not participate in the construction of the model and its geographical location is far away from the five modeling sites table 8 shows the prediction accuracy results of the generalization test the average mae was less than 0 93 fig 9 further shows the comparison curve between the predicted value and the observed value of soil water content at different depths the fluctuations in the predicted water content of the surface soil 0 20 cm are violent while the curve tends to be gentle with the increase of soil depth this may be due to the fluctuation range and variance in the surface soil water content being higher than those at greater soil depths table 4 the advantage of the hybrid cnn gru model proposed in this study is that it achieves better accuracy in predicting soil water content than other mainstream models by extracting high dimensional and time series features of the data however the soil is susceptible to rainfall or irrigation so it is difficult to predict the process of soil moisture content increase in addition the dataset validated for the model has limitations in terms of data volume weather forecasting and site distribution further research can be carried out in the future 1 to enrich the number of sites and data volume utilized for model training 2 to improve the fitting accuracy and generalization ability of the model by increasing more input parameters such as soil texture and bulk density and 3 to optimize the model structure and parameters to improve the fitting and generalized prediction ability 6 conclusions in this study we proposed a hybrid cnn gru model for predicting soil water content at different depths in the maize root zone which integrated the strong feature expression ability of cnn and the time series feature memory ability of gru the individual learners based on cnn and gru were integrated in parallel the output of the individual learners was concatenated as input to the meta learner for further training to obtain the final prediction results the meteorological and soil water content data of five typical sites in the primary maize production areas of shandong province were utilized as modeling data 80 of which were utilized for model training and validation and 20 for model testing according to the pearson correlation

and the data of continuous 8 days were gridded as model input the results showed that the hybrid cnn gru model was superior to the cnn based and gru based individual learners in terms of prediction accuracy and convergence rate and the overall prediction accuracy improved with the increase of the soil depth furthermore we extended the forecast period the prediction accuracy of the hybrid cnn gru model for soil water content on days 5 7 and 10 were similar with an average mse of less than 1 0 in addition the hybrid cnn gru model also obtained a satisfactory generalized prediction performance in conclusion the hybrid cnn gru model achieved exceptional performance in soil water content prediction at different depths in the maize root zone and the research on the hybrid cnn gru model could

fertilization rates averaged over all fertilization rates the fruit yield under rdies was 8 6 22 3 lower than that under fi in both years but the iwue significantly increased from 3 7 to 18 6 compared with the fi treatment the rdims treatment had no significant effect on fruit yield but significantly increased the iwue 35 5 44 7 total sugar ts content 3 7 8 5 and carotenoid content cc 1 5 13 1 in both years at the same irrigation level the pn gs and tr increased with an increasing fertilization rate while the fruit yield iwue ts and vitamin c vc content of fresh fruit first decreased but then increased with increasing fertilization rate iwue was more closely related to photosynthesis characteristics at the flowering stage than at the mature stage but fruit quality was more closely related to photosynthesis characteristics at the mature stage than at the flowering stage compared with the fifh treatment the rdimsfm treatment significantly increased the fruit yield by 10 1 and 6 6 in 2018 and 2019 respectively and increased the iwue by 28 1 and 35 6 respectively on the basis of the topsis method the multi target optimum scheduling of mango was achieved under the rdimsfm treatment the identified optimum combination of water and fertilizer can provide a scientific basis for irrigation and fertilization optimization and management in the hot dry environment of southwest china keywords micro irrigation production fruit quality regulated deficit irrigation 1 introduction mango fruits are among the five major tropical fruits worldwide mango is considered the tropical fruit king and is widely distributed in asia south america north america and africa in more than 100 countries lauricella et al 2017 china is one of the principal production areas of mango in 2017 the planting area was 2 1 106 ha and the annual output was 1 8 109 kg mo et al 2018 the dry hot region of southwest china is characterized by sufficient amounts of daylight and warm temperature to grow mango trees however precipitation in this area is low and unevenly distributed evaporation is high and the dry season is long in addition local farmers mainly do not irrigate or apply diffuse irrigation and excessive and unmonitored fertilization is widespread a lack of scientific based water and fertilizer management limits the high quality efficient production of local mango fruits regulated deficit irrigation rdi not only can greatly reduce the amount of irrigation but also can substantially improve fruit quality levin et al 2018 rdi 75 evapotranspiration etc or 50 etc at the early flowering and fruiting stages was shown to reduce grape fruit yield significantly while rdi 50 etc during the mature stage had little influence on yield or water use efficiency wue chaves et al 2007 compared with full irrigation mild water deficit accelerates the breakdown of starch within mango fruits and increases the fructose content léchaudel et al 2005 and moderate deficit irrigation can effectively improve the quality of mango fruits el hoseiny et al 2020 fukuda et al 2013 most previous studies on this topic have focused on improving mango yield and quality by considering the effects of irrigation water deficit levels however few studies have considered the critical period of water demand that affects mango yield and quality mango trees require high soil nutrient levels during their growth and maturity stages fertilization is the main method for providing soil nutrients needed for mango growth the effects of reduced fertilization on mango yield are associated with reduced quantity kumari et al 2020 a 20 reduction in fertilizer use compared with conventional levels has been shown not only to maintain mango yield but also to improve the soluble solid content and sugar acid ratio suar substantially kumar et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 the soluble solids content sugar content suar and total acid content in mango have been shown to decrease significantly in response to reduced fertilization baloch and bibi 2012 malik and singh 2006 however there is still a lack of relevant research on the appropriate amount of fertilizer needed to maintain mango yields in the dry hot environment of southwest china rational water and fertilizer management practices have a significant effect on crop yield and quality du et al 2010 schulze et al 2013 sinha et al 2017 yan et al 2020 compared with conventional irrigation fertilization drip irrigation fertilization was shown to increase arabica coffee yields and wue significantly liu et al 2016 moreover studies have shown that increased photosynthesis is an effective measure to reduce non stomatal limitations and increase both plant metabolism and dry matter accumulation thus increasing crop yields brar et al 2020 de lima et al 2015 doupis et al 2017 compared with the combination of furrow fertilizer and traditional diffuse irrigation drip irrigation was shown to provide better water fertilizer coupling conditions for mango and significantly improved mango pn tr yield and single fruit weight lu et al 2012 spreer et al 2009 water deficiency caused by rdi can hinder plant growth by reducing water absorption by plant cells and adversely affecting many physiological and biochemical reactions liang et al 2019 inhibition of photosynthesis is one of the main physiological consequences of water deficiency occurring due to stomatal closure chlorophyll degradation and damage to photochemical structures resulting in a reduced intercellular co2 concentration urban et al 2017 the net pn tr and gs of grape leaves have been shown to decrease in response to deficit irrigation at the fruit development stage du et al 2013 however the effects of changes in deficient irrigation levels and fertilization rates on mango photosynthesis characteristics in dry hot environments have not been reported in the scientific literature as such the objectives of this study were to determine the effects of different deficient irrigation levels and fertilization rates on mango photosynthesis characteristics and fruit yield in a hot dry environment our aim was to assess the relationship between fruit quality and photosynthesis characteristics at different growth stages to determine the best agronomic practices for the effective use of water and fertilizer resources we hypothesized that a deficient irrigation at different growth stages would significantly affect photosynthesis characteristics as a function of the fertilization rate and that b the photosynthesis characteristics would significantly affect the fruit yield and quality of mango during the critical period of growth the results of this study are expected to improve the selection of an optimal deficit irrigation strategy and the rational use of fertilization in dry hot environments therefore these results provide important information for the production of high quality mango fruits 2 materials and methods 2 1 site

stage than at the mature stage but fruit quality was more closely related to photosynthesis characteristics at the mature stage than at the flowering stage when mango fresh fruit yield nutritional quality and iwue were taken as evaluation indexes the entropy topsis method was used to evaluate the results of the twelve treatments comprehensively table 5 the greater the comprehensive evaluation

from high to low was as follows rdimsfm rdimsfh rdimsfl rdifsfm fifm fifh rdifsfh rdifsfl fifl rdiesfm rdiesfh rdiesfl rdimsfm was characterized as having the greatest ci followed by rdimsfh while that under rdiesfl was clearly lowest under the same fertilization rate the ranking of the ci values from high to low was rdims fi rdies under the same irrigation level the ci value first increased but then decreased with decreasing fertilization rate 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation and fertilization on photosynthesis characteristics the net pn gs and tr of mango were maximized under fi which is consistent with many research results helaly et al 2017 urban et al 2006 the results of this study showed that the pn gs and tr were significantly lower and that the wuei was significantly greater under deficit irrigation than that under fi at the different growth stages there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon the first potential reason is the reduction in gs and obstruction of co2 entry into leaves due to water stress or a decrease in the photosynthesis activity in mesophyll cells negin and moshelion 2016 another reason may be that to maintain internal water potential and cell turgor the tr decreases because of regulatory functions such as stomatal closure thus preventing water loss and decreases in internal water potential banchi et al 2018 resco de dios et al 2018 we found that the pn and tr of mango leaves increased with an increasing fertilization rate this may be related to increased physiological activity of mesophyll cells in response to fertilizer application rehman et al 2020 increased ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate rubp carboxylase activity tian et al 2019 increased activity and contents of antioxidant enzymes and protective enzyme systems and the maintenance of high amounts of chlorophyll guo et al 2018 in addition fertilization increased the levels of soluble protein increased both the synthesis and activity of photosynthesis related enzymes in the leaves and increased the gs chloroplast surface area and leaf volume which enhanced photosynthesis jin et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 these findings are consistent with the results of our study showing that an increased fertilization rate significantly increased the pn gs and tr of the mango leaves water fertilizer coupling affects plant photosynthesis by regulating pigment contents stomatal and non stomatal factors and enzyme activity in leaves gago et al 2014 wise et al 2004 the results of the current study also showed that the wuei under a moderate fertilizer fm application rate was greatest under rdi this may have occurred because fm under drought stress can improve the development of plant roots and the ability to absorb and transport soil water and nutrients while expanding the area from which plants can absorb water and nutrients thus promoting plant growth and improving photosynthesis kumar et al 2019 ullah et al 2019 4 2 effects of irrigation and fertilization on fruit yield quality and iwue the effects of rdi on plant yield and quality at different growth stages are mainly due to the different water requirements and sensitivities of biological processes such as photosynthesis nutrient absorption and physiological hormone metabolism and synthesis grzebisz et al 2013 sánchez virosta et al 2020 in the present study compared with those under fi the mango yield and iwue under rdifs decreased by 12 8 27 9 and 0 5 15 respectively a possible reason is that a lack of water during the flowering stage leads to bud loss affects the completion of the pollination process and causes young fruit to drop thus reducing yield and iwue gatti et al 2016 li et al 2018 compared with fi rdies significantly reduced mango yields mainly because the expansion period is an important period for pulp development water deficit inhibits the expansion and division of pulp cells and their ability to absorb nutrients reduces the weight of individual fruits and thus reduces yield these results are consistent with those of zhang et al 2019 who found the mango fruit expansion stage to be the phenological stage with the greatest water demand the results of the current study also show that the rdies treatment reduced the ts percentage vc content and cc of fresh fruits mainly because the fruit expansion stage is sensitive in terms of the synthesis of certain nutritional indicators and because water deficit inhibits the synthesis of these indicators spreer et al 2007 although rdi can significantly improve the iwue of mango at the expansion period during which there is high water consumption this comes at the expense of yield and decreased quality of fresh fruits thus deficit irrigation is not suitable during the expansion period the results of this study showed that the rdims treatment significantly increased the iwue of mango the underlying reason may be that the maturation stage is the critical period of non water demand for mango trees and the water demand is low ntsoane et al 2019 the rdims treatment could reduce the water potential of fruit cells enhancing the ability of cells to absorb water and nutrients from the outside and thus increasing the soluble solids content vc content and cc in the fruits a certain amount of water deficit at maturity not only can increase the distribution of photosynthesis products to reproductive organs but also can maintain yields and increase the iwue therefore rdi is recommended during the mature period increasing fertilizer within a certain range can increase crop yields but if the maximum amount of fertilizer is exceeded the yields will decrease wang et al 2019b the current study showed that under the same irrigation level the mango yield was greatest under the fm treatment this may be related to the ability of the pn and tr to be maintained at relatively high levels with appropriate fertilizer application and more photosynthesis products can be produced as a result of vigorous vegetative growth geilfus 2018 an appropriate amount of fertilizer is beneficial to root growth promoting nutrient absorption and cytokinin production and indirectly promoting pulp cell division and expansion kurepin et al 2014 however excessive fertilization has been shown to increase photosynthesis rates and the competitiveness of reproductive growth which is not conducive to the yield increases wang et al 2014 less fertilizer can directly lead to insufficient soil nutrient supplies which lead to decreases in yield zhang et al 2019 the results of the current study showed that most of the nutritional indexes of the mango fruits were greatest under fm this is consistent with results showing that proper fertilization can improve soluble solids the soar the ts and vc content of fruits and improve their taste li et al 2019 however research has shown that changes in vc total acid soluble sugar contents of fruits and the suar in mango fruits with increasing fertilizer application were not significant zhu et al 2017 this phenomenon may be related to the different types and amounts of fertilizer applied the synergistic effect of water and fertilizer is the key to promoting crop growth increasing yields and improving quality helaly et al 2018 this study found that the yield iwue and vc content and cc were greatest under rdimsfm the combined supply of water and fertilizer not only can promote the growth of crops and increase yield but also can improve fruit quality to promote fertilizer with water and regulate water with fertilizer compared with conventional surface irrigation fertilization such as drip irrigation or sprinkler irrigation subsurface continuous micro moistening fertigation can provide a favorable water fertilizer gas thermal soil environment for crop growth in dry hot areas where evaporation is high whalen et al 2019 this technique improves the ability of the root system to synthesize various amino acids hormones and other substances and promotes the ability of the root system to absorb water and nutrients to improve photosynthesis and crop yield vacheron et al 2013 4 3 comprehensive evaluation based on entropy values the topsis method high yield is the goal of fruit farmers high quality is demanded by consumers and iwue is the core component of efficient use of agricultural water resources however in actual production it is difficult to achieve maximum output quality and iwue at the same time in this study the topsis method was used to evaluate the yield iwue and quality of the twelve treatments this method can provide effective solutions for the optimization of different traits and comprehensive evaluation of target populations this study improved the traditional topsis method and adopted the entropy method to determine the weight of each evaluation index thus enhancing the reliability and rationality of the evaluation results although there was a slight difference in the overall evaluation value of the two year entropy topsis analysis the overall benefit of the rdimsfm treatment was greatest therefore for the coupling of rdi at the mango fruit ripening stage fertilizer treatment not only resulted in increased yields and iwue but also improved nutritional quality the results of this study provide a practical reference for mango irrigation and fertilization and efficient and high quality production 5 conclusion 1 compared with adequate irrigation fi at the same fertilization level water deficit at different phenological stages decreased the pn gs and tr of mango leaves but increased the wuei under the same irrigation mode the pn gs and tr decreased with decreasing fertilizer application 2 compared with fi at the same fertilization level rdims at the mature stage could ensure mango yields improve iwue and increase the ts percentage vitamin c content and ccs of fruits under the same irrigation amount fm produced greater yields ts percentages in the

few studies have addressed the use of water and fertilizer management practices in hot dry environments with the aim of achieving relatively favorable levels of these parameters concurrently we used the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis method to identify optimal water and fertilizer management practices that resulted in high fruit yields and high iwue in

identified optimum combination of water and fertilizer can provide a scientific basis for irrigation and fertilization optimization and management in the hot dry environment of southwest china keywords micro irrigation production fruit quality regulated deficit irrigation 1 introduction mango fruits are among the five major tropical fruits worldwide mango is considered the tropical fruit king and is widely distributed in asia south america north america and africa in more than 100 countries lauricella et al 2017 china is one of the principal production areas of mango in 2017 the planting area was 2 1 106 ha and the annual output was 1 8 109 kg mo et al 2018 the dry hot region of southwest china is characterized by sufficient amounts of daylight and warm temperature to grow mango trees however precipitation in this area is low and unevenly distributed evaporation is high and the dry season is long in addition local farmers mainly do not irrigate or apply diffuse irrigation and excessive and unmonitored fertilization is widespread a lack of scientific based water and fertilizer management limits the high quality efficient production of local mango fruits regulated deficit irrigation rdi not only can greatly reduce the amount of irrigation but also can substantially improve fruit quality levin et al 2018 rdi 75 evapotranspiration etc or 50 etc at the early flowering and fruiting stages was shown to reduce grape fruit yield significantly while rdi 50 etc during the mature stage had little influence on yield or water use efficiency wue chaves et al 2007 compared with full irrigation mild water deficit accelerates the breakdown of starch within mango fruits and increases the fructose content léchaudel et al 2005 and moderate deficit irrigation can effectively improve the quality of mango fruits el hoseiny et al 2020 fukuda et al 2013 most previous studies on this topic have focused on improving mango yield and quality by considering the effects of irrigation water deficit levels however few studies have considered the critical period of water demand that affects mango yield and quality mango trees require high soil nutrient levels during their growth and maturity stages fertilization is the main method for providing soil nutrients needed for mango growth the effects of reduced fertilization on mango yield are associated with reduced quantity kumari et al 2020 a 20 reduction in fertilizer use compared with conventional levels has been shown not only to maintain mango yield but also to improve the soluble solid content and sugar acid ratio suar substantially kumar et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 the soluble solids content sugar content suar and total acid content in mango have been shown to decrease significantly in response to reduced fertilization baloch and bibi 2012 malik and singh 2006 however there is still a lack of relevant research on the appropriate amount of fertilizer needed to maintain mango yields in the dry hot environment of southwest china rational water and fertilizer management practices have a significant effect on crop yield and quality du et al 2010 schulze et al 2013 sinha et al 2017 yan et al 2020 compared with conventional irrigation fertilization drip irrigation fertilization was shown to increase arabica coffee yields and wue significantly liu et al 2016 moreover studies have shown that increased photosynthesis is an effective measure to reduce non stomatal limitations and increase both plant metabolism and dry matter accumulation thus increasing crop yields brar et al 2020 de lima et al 2015 doupis et al 2017 compared with the combination of furrow fertilizer and traditional diffuse irrigation drip irrigation was shown to provide better water fertilizer coupling conditions for mango and significantly improved mango pn tr yield and single fruit weight lu et al 2012 spreer et al 2009 water deficiency caused by rdi can hinder plant growth by reducing water absorption by plant cells and adversely affecting many physiological and biochemical reactions liang et al 2019 inhibition of photosynthesis is one of the main physiological consequences of water deficiency occurring due to stomatal closure chlorophyll degradation and damage to photochemical structures resulting in a reduced intercellular co2 concentration urban et al 2017 the net pn tr and gs of grape leaves have been shown to decrease in response to deficit irrigation at the fruit development stage du et al 2013 however the effects of changes in deficient irrigation levels and fertilization rates on mango photosynthesis characteristics in dry hot environments have not been reported in the scientific literature as such the objectives of this study were to determine the effects of different deficient irrigation levels and fertilization rates on mango photosynthesis characteristics and fruit yield in a hot dry environment our aim was to assess the relationship between fruit quality and photosynthesis characteristics at different growth stages to determine the best agronomic practices for the effective use of water and fertilizer resources we hypothesized that a deficient irrigation at different growth stages would significantly affect photosynthesis characteristics as a function of the fertilization rate and that b the photosynthesis characteristics would significantly affect the fruit yield and quality of mango during the critical period of growth the results of this study are expected to improve the selection of an optimal deficit irrigation strategy and the rational use of fertilization in dry hot environments therefore these results provide important information for the production of high quality mango fruits 2 materials and methods 2 1 site

that under rdiesfl was clearly lowest under the same fertilization rate the ranking of the ci values from high to low was rdims fi rdies under the same irrigation level the ci value first increased but then decreased with decreasing fertilization rate 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation and fertilization on photosynthesis characteristics the net pn gs and tr of mango were maximized under fi which is consistent with many research results helaly et al 2017 urban et al 2006 the results of this study showed that the pn gs and tr were significantly lower and that the wuei was significantly greater under deficit irrigation than that under fi at the different growth stages there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon the first potential reason is the reduction in gs and obstruction of co2 entry into leaves due to water stress or a decrease in the photosynthesis activity in mesophyll cells negin and moshelion 2016 another reason may be that to maintain internal water potential and cell turgor the tr decreases because of regulatory functions such as stomatal closure thus preventing water loss and decreases in internal water potential banchi et al 2018 resco de dios et al 2018 we found that the pn and tr of mango leaves increased with an increasing fertilization rate this may be related to increased physiological activity of mesophyll cells in response to fertilizer application rehman et al 2020 increased ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate rubp carboxylase activity tian et al 2019 increased activity and contents of antioxidant enzymes and protective enzyme systems and the maintenance of high amounts of chlorophyll guo et al 2018 in addition fertilization increased the levels of soluble protein increased both the synthesis and activity of photosynthesis related enzymes in the leaves and increased the gs chloroplast surface area and leaf volume which enhanced photosynthesis jin et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 these findings are consistent with the results of our study showing that an increased fertilization rate significantly increased the pn gs and tr of the mango leaves water fertilizer coupling affects plant photosynthesis by regulating pigment contents stomatal and non stomatal factors and enzyme activity in leaves gago et al 2014 wise et al 2004 the results of the current study also showed that the wuei under a moderate fertilizer fm application rate was greatest under rdi this may have occurred because fm under drought stress can improve the development of plant roots and the ability to absorb and transport soil water and nutrients while expanding the area from which plants can absorb water and nutrients thus promoting plant growth and improving photosynthesis kumar et al 2019 ullah et al 2019 4 2 effects of irrigation and fertilization on fruit yield quality and iwue the effects of rdi on plant yield and quality at different growth stages are mainly due to the different water requirements and sensitivities of biological processes such as photosynthesis nutrient absorption and physiological hormone metabolism and synthesis grzebisz et al 2013 sánchez virosta et al 2020 in the present study compared with those under fi the mango yield and iwue under rdifs decreased by 12 8 27 9 and 0 5 15 respectively a possible reason is that a lack of water during the flowering stage leads to bud loss affects the completion of the pollination process and causes young fruit to drop thus reducing yield and iwue gatti et al 2016 li et al 2018 compared with fi rdies significantly reduced mango yields mainly because the expansion period is an important period for pulp development water deficit inhibits the expansion and division of pulp cells and their ability to absorb nutrients reduces the weight of individual fruits and thus reduces yield these results are consistent with those of zhang et al 2019 who found the mango fruit expansion stage to be the phenological stage with the greatest water demand the results of the current study also show that the rdies treatment reduced the ts percentage vc content and cc of fresh fruits mainly because the fruit expansion stage is sensitive in terms of the synthesis of certain nutritional indicators and because water deficit inhibits the synthesis of these indicators spreer et al 2007 although rdi can significantly improve the iwue of mango at the expansion period during which there is high water consumption this comes at the expense of yield and decreased quality of fresh fruits thus deficit irrigation is not suitable during the expansion period the results of this study showed that the rdims treatment significantly increased the iwue of mango the underlying reason may be that the maturation stage is the critical period of non water demand for mango trees and the water demand is low ntsoane et al 2019 the rdims treatment could reduce the water potential of fruit cells enhancing the ability of cells to absorb water and nutrients from the outside and thus increasing the soluble solids content vc content and cc in the fruits a certain amount of water deficit at maturity not only can increase the distribution of photosynthesis products to reproductive organs but also can maintain yields and increase the iwue therefore rdi is recommended during the mature period increasing fertilizer within a certain range can increase crop yields but if the maximum amount of fertilizer is exceeded the yields will decrease wang et al 2019b the current study showed that under the same irrigation level the mango yield was greatest under the fm treatment this may be related to the ability of the pn and tr to be maintained at relatively high levels with appropriate fertilizer application and more photosynthesis products can be produced as a result of vigorous vegetative growth geilfus 2018 an appropriate amount of fertilizer is beneficial to root growth promoting nutrient absorption and cytokinin production and indirectly promoting pulp cell division and expansion kurepin et al 2014 however excessive fertilization has been shown to increase photosynthesis rates and the competitiveness of reproductive growth which is not conducive to the yield increases wang et al 2014 less fertilizer can directly lead to insufficient soil nutrient supplies which lead to decreases in yield zhang et al 2019 the results of the current study showed that most of the nutritional indexes of the mango fruits were greatest under fm this is consistent with results showing that proper fertilization can improve soluble solids the soar the ts and vc content of fruits and improve their taste li et al 2019 however research has shown that changes in vc total acid soluble sugar contents of fruits and the suar in mango fruits with increasing fertilizer application were not significant zhu et al 2017 this phenomenon may be related to the different types and amounts of fertilizer applied the synergistic effect of water and fertilizer is the key to promoting crop growth increasing yields and improving quality helaly et al 2018 this study found that the yield iwue and vc content and cc were greatest under rdimsfm the combined supply of water and fertilizer not only can promote the growth of crops and increase yield but also can improve fruit quality to promote fertilizer with water and regulate water with fertilizer compared with conventional surface irrigation fertilization such as drip irrigation or sprinkler irrigation subsurface continuous micro moistening fertigation can provide a favorable water fertilizer gas thermal soil environment for crop growth in dry hot areas where evaporation is high whalen et al 2019 this technique improves the ability of the root system to synthesize various amino acids hormones and other substances and promotes the ability of the root system to absorb water and nutrients to improve photosynthesis and crop yield vacheron et al 2013 4 3 comprehensive evaluation based on entropy values the topsis method high yield is the goal of fruit farmers high quality is demanded by consumers and iwue is the core component of efficient use of agricultural water resources however in actual production it is difficult to achieve maximum output quality and iwue at the same time in this study the topsis method was used to evaluate the yield iwue and quality of the twelve treatments this method can provide effective solutions for the optimization of different traits and comprehensive evaluation of target populations this study improved the traditional topsis method and adopted the entropy method to determine the weight of each evaluation index thus enhancing the reliability and rationality of the evaluation results although there was a slight difference in the overall evaluation value of the two year entropy topsis analysis the overall benefit of the rdimsfm treatment was greatest therefore for the coupling of rdi at the mango fruit ripening stage fertilizer treatment not only resulted in increased yields and iwue but also improved nutritional quality the results of this study provide a practical reference for mango irrigation and fertilization and efficient and high quality production 5 conclusion 1 compared with adequate irrigation fi at the same fertilization level water deficit at different phenological stages decreased the pn gs and tr of mango leaves but increased the wuei under the same irrigation mode the pn gs and tr decreased with decreasing fertilizer application 2 compared with fi at the same fertilization level rdims at the mature stage could ensure mango yields improve iwue and increase the ts percentage vitamin c content and ccs of fruits under the same irrigation amount fm produced greater yields ts percentages in the fruit vc content and iwue than did fh 3 entropy topsis analysis revealed that the mango yield iwue and quality indexes under the rdimsfm treatment presented the greatest comprehensive scores demonstrating that this treatment is a suitable coupling of irrigation and fertilization for mango in dry hot areas declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no competing
