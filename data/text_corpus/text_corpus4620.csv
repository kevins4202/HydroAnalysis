different wave conditions the proposed model is applied to different cases test of regular wave reflection from a vertical wall is first carried out regular wave decomposition over a submerged breakwater is then simulated focused wave generation and propagation over a submerged breakwater are finally studied and compared with a newly performed experiment good agreements are obtained all the results indicate that the cip based model with a non reflection internal wave maker can work as a powerful tool to study wave structure interaction in coastal engineering keywords cip method momentum source function internal wave maker focused wave self adaptive source region method vof method 1 introduction understanding and prediction of the interaction between waves and structures are crucial for the design and protection of coastal structures when it comes to this kind of problems wave simulations are more convenient compared with physical experiment or field observation it can give comprehensive time history data in terms of waveforms flow velocity fields and energy variation to understand the evolution and impact mechanism with less costs and technical limitations wave generation plays an significant role in numerical wave flumes during the development of wave simulation there are many kinds of methods for wave generation in numerical models such as internal wave maker lin and liu 1999 choi and yoon 2009 moving boundary wave maker higuera 2015 and velocity boundary wave maker higuera et al 2013 troch and de rouck 1999 when it refers to wave structure interaction one of the key challenge for numerical wave models is to maintain the incident wave well and eliminate unwanted reflected waves from structures however when using the moving boundary wave maker or velocity boundary wave maker the reflected waves from the structure will propagate towards the wave maker boundary and then be reflected in a long time simulation the subsequent incident wave could be strongly affected by the secondary reflected wave which would greatly contaminate the modeling results many numerical techniques have been developed to overcome this problem one popular method is adopting a generating absorbing layer troch and de rouck 1999 to absorb the secondary reflection wave however when considering the high nonlinear waves the implement of the generating absorbing layer will have great difficulties due to the assumption of the linear superposition for incident and reflected waves besides the accumulation of errors caused by this type of boundary condition may eventually contaminate numerical results in a long time simulation wei and kirby 1995 while for the internal wave maker waves can be generated from a region inside the numerical flume and be absorbed at the two ends of the flume hence the reflected waves from the structure can pass through the wave maker region without affecting the wave generation and are finally absorbed by the sponge layers in this way the effect of re reflection in a long time simulation can be avoided two kinds of internal wave maker theories have been developed including mass source and momentum source approaches larsen and dancy 1983 first introduced the idea of the internal wave maker which numerically generates waves by employing a line source to the boussinesq type equations in shallow water condition lee and suh 1998 developed a similar approach based on the mild slope equations and studied the mass and energy transports of the generated wave lin and liu 1999 first proposed an internal wave maker which added mass source function to a navier stokes equations based model and different types of the waves were generated furthermore wei et al 1999 derived the relationship between the free surface and a momentum source function and proposed a momentum source wave generation method based on the boussinesq equations choi and yoon 2009 first used the idea of wei et al 1999 and successfully generated periodic waves in a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations based model ha et al 2013 added the momentum source wave maker to a navier stokes based model and employed frequency and directional spectra to generated directional monochromatic and irregular waves in three dimensions liu et al 2015 added a momentum source internal wave maker based on an incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics isph model and investigated the sensitivities of source region width in different monochromatic waves chen and hsiao 2016 generated 3d water waves using mass source wave maker in a navier stokes model and verified the capability of the numerical sponge layers great achievements have been obtained however studies on the wave maker source region width were rare and most of them only focused on the monochromatic wave there is no doubt that the width of wave maker source region has a great effect on the wave generation so further investigation is needed to study the effect of the wave maker source region width on different wave conditions recently numerical simulations of water waves based on the navier stokes equations have been developed remarkably for the capability of fully reproducing wave characteristics compared with conventional wave models based on the assumptions of depth averaged or potential flow theories the numerical model based on navier stokes equations has significant advantages because it can solve the corresponding mathematic equations without any simplification and represent the complex water wave dynamic problems such as violent free surface flow wave breaking and wave structure interaction accurately there are two main methods in navier stokes based model one is the mesh free methods such as the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method monaghan 1994 or the moving particle semi implicit mps method koshizuka and oka 1996 however the mesh free methods are limited by their oscillations in the pressure field and the low computational efficiency as a consequence improved versions and promising results are currently available xu and deng 2016 perez and garcia 2017 another is the mesh based methods such as the volume of fluid vof approach hirt and nichols 1981 however the discretization of the advection equation using the mesh based methods always causes numerical diffusion moraga et al 2015 to improve the above problem various schemes have been proposed within the framework of the finite difference method high order resolution schemes have been developed the constrained interpolation profile cip method was first proposed by takewaki et al 1985 in order to reduce the numerical diffusion of low order finite difference method it was further used by yabe and aoki 1991 for solving hyperbolic equations the advantage of cip method is that it can provide a third order interpolation function in a single grid which makes it a compact high order scheme with less numerical diffusion it is found to be a powerful flow solver for the convective terms of navier stokes equations hu et al 2006 proposed a constrained interpolation profile cip scheme to simulate the extremely nonlinear phenomena such as water slamming on the deck of an advancing ship in waves hu and kashiwagi 2009 applied a cip based method to investigate the nonlinear wave body interaction problems involving violent free surface motions zhao and hu 2012 studied nonlinear interactions between extreme waves and floating body using an enhanced cip based model good results have been obtained with the cip based model however nearly all of them used paddle or velocity boundary wave maker and reflected wave from structures was solved by increasing the distance between wave maker and structure or adopting the active wave absorption which were carried out at the expense of computational efficiency therefore it is urgent to employ a new wave making strategy in the cip based model to solve the problem of re reflected waves when considering the interaction between waves and structures the purpose of this paper is to overcome the above mentioned limitations and supply more reliable results in wave modeling the momentum source function derived from the boussinesq equations choi and yoon 2009 will be employed in our cip based model a self adaptive source region method is proposed to optimize the width of the momentum source region to different wave conditions the efficiency and accuracy of the coupled internal wave maker and cip based model are verified by several benchmark wave simulations in addition to monochromatic waves the focused waves consisting of different component waves are carried out to verify the application of this model to different frequency waves the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the cip based numerical model with internal wave maker in section 3 regular wave propagation and reflection from a vertical wall are carried out meanwhile the high nonlinearity regular wave generation and decomposition over an impermeable breakwater are performed section 4 describes the process of focused wave generation and propagation over a submerged breakwater finally the paper is finished with some conclusions 2 numerical model with internal wave maker the computations presented in this paper are performed by means of a cip based model hu and kashiwagi 2004 zhao and hu 2012 the turbulence level in the test case is less important and the turbulence model is not considered here meanwhile surface tension is neglected in this study 2 1 governing equations the governing equations for two dimensional incompressible viscous fluid flow are mass conservation and navier stokes equations expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ x j μ u i x j g i s i m a b where x i i 1 2 are the coordinates in a cartesian coordinate system u i i 1 2 are the velocity components t is time ρ is the fluid density μ is the dynamic viscosity p is the pressure g i are the body forces for example gravity s i m are momentum source function and a b is damping term the wave structure interaction is treated as a multiphase problem that includes water air and solid body a volume fraction field ϕ m m 1 2 and 3 indicate water air and solid respectively is adopted to represent and capture the phase interface the evolution of the volume function is governed by 3 ϕ m t u i ϕ m x i 0 where ϕ m is set a range between 0 and 1 to overcome the instabilities at the interface the density and viscosity of liquid and solid are assumed to be the same the volume function for solid ϕ 3 is determined by a lagrangian method in which a fixed rigid body is assumed then the volume function for air ϕ 2 is determined by ϕ 2 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 3 after the volume function calculated the physical property λ such as the density ρ and viscosity μ in each grid can be defined as 4 λ m 1 3 ϕ m λ m 2 2 momentum source wave maker compared with the mass source term added to continuity equation the momentum source function added to the momentum equations is more convenient and stable to generate periodic waves due to less parameters ha et al 2013 in this paper the momentum source function is adopted to generate waves wei et al 1999 employed the linear boussinesq equations to derive the following mass source function from the continuity equation shown as 5 η t h u α 1 h 3 2 u f x y t 6 u t g η α h 2 2 u t s m x y t where η is the free surface displacement h is the water depth g is the gravitational acceleration u is the velocity vector f and s m are the mass and momentum source term the parameters in the above equations are determined by 7 α 1 α 1 3 8 α z α h z α 2 h 1 according to the extended boussinesq equation of nwogu 1993 u becomes a representative velocity vector at the position z α 0 530 h the position is chosen by the linear dispersion function according to this the above equations can be solved by green s function and the mass source function f is determined by wei et al 1999 and choi and yoon 2009 9 f x y t exp β x 2 4 π 2 d k y ω exp i k y y ω t d ω d k y 10 d h ω 2 α 1 g k 4 h 3 ω i 1 k 1 α k h 2 cos θ 11 i 1 π β exp k 2 4 β 12 β 80 δ 2 l 2 where d is the source function amplitude which can be determined from the desired wave characteristics β is the parameter associated with the width of source function δ 2 w l is a relevant parameter for the width of wave making region w is the width of source region ω k θ h l are the wave parameters of angular frequency wave number wave direction wave height and wave length respectively using the velocity potential and combining eqs 5 and 6 the momentum source function can be written as 13 s m g f d t so the x coordinate and y coordinate momentum source functions can be expressed as 14 s x m g 2 β x exp β x 2 1 4 π 2 i d k y ω ω exp i k y y ω t d ω d k y 15 s y m g exp β x 2 1 4 π 2 k y d k y ω ω exp i k y y ω t d ω d k y for the 2d linear monochromatic regular wave the momentum source function can be simplified as 16 s m g 2 β x exp β x 2 d ω sin ω t according to the spatio temporal focusing model kharif and pelinovsky 2003 the momentum source function for the focused wave can be obtained by the linear superposition of monochromatic waves 17 s m g 2 β x exp β x 2 i 1 n d i ω i cos k i x x f ω i t t f where n is the number of wave components x f is the focusing position and t f is the focusing time 2 3 wave absorbing method the numerical sponge layer proposed by larsen and dancy 1983 is employed in this study to prevent the undesirable secondary wave reflections the efficiently absorbing coefficient a b is adopted from wei and kirby 1995 which has been proved the great ability by many studies lin and liu 2004 liu et al 2015 shown in the following equation 18 a b c α exp x x s t x a b n c 1 exp 1 1 where a b is the absorbing coefficient x s t and x a b are the starting position and length of the absorbing region respectively c α and n c are the empirical damping coefficients determined via the numerical test the damping coefficient must be defined inside the sponge layer and it is zero outside the sponge layer lin and liu 2004 used the empirical coefficients n c 10 and c 200 in their study which works very well in the rans based model in this study n c 10 and c α min 200 0 9 d t are adopted here d t is the computational time step instead of a constant value of c α a variable parameter is chosen to avoid negative values when the spatial and time steps are large 2 4 numerical implementations in this study a staggered grid system is used for the spatial discretization and a fractional method is applied to solve navier stokes equations the first step is to calculate the advection term as eq 19 shows 19 u i t u j u i x j 0 a cip approach is employed to solve the above equations yabe et al 2001 the basic principle of cip method is an interpolation in a grid by a cubic polynomial with the value and differential on the grid node 20 u i x x i u i δ t where x is the unknown coefficient function x i is the cubic polynomial to approximate the spatial profile of u i in an upwind cell the superscript denotes the intermediate time level after the advection step the second step is to solve the diffusion term momentum source term and damping term by a central difference scheme 21 u i u i δ t 1 ρ x j μ u i x j g i s i m a b where u i is the solution of this diffusion term in the end the pressure term is solved by the projection method 22 u i n 1 u i δ t ρ p n 1 x i 23 x i 1 ρ p n 1 x i 1 δ t u x i where the superscript n 1 denotes the new time the red black successive over relaxation approach sor is employed to solve the above poisson equation after the total flow field updated the free surface is captured by a volume of fluid vof type method the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing with slope weighting scheme thinc sw scheme compared with the original vof method the thinc sw scheme first proposed by xiao et al 2011 uses a smoothed heaviside function with a variable steepness parameter which can keep the sharpness of the interface and significantly improve the geometrical accuracy the solid boundary is treated by an immersed boundary method ibm proposed by peskin 1972 more details about the flow solver can be found in hu and kashiwagi 2004 and zhao et al 2014 3 model validations and applications for regular waves in this section the ability of the proposed model to generate regular waves is validated a series of numerical tests are carried out including monochromatic waves reflection from a vertical wall and the interaction between regular waves and a submerged breakwater numerical results are compared with available theoretical solutions or experimental results as well as other numerical results 3 1 wave reflection from a vertical wall wave reflection from a vertical wall has been extensively studied to validate the capability of a numerical model in terms of wave generation wave damping and the non reflection characteristics lin and liu 1999 choi and yoon 2009 liu et al 2015 hu et al 2015 in this part the cip model with momentum source internal wave maker will be applied to this problem in this simulation the still water depth h is 0 2 m and the channel is 13 m in length the monochromatic wave of amplitude a 0 005 m and period t 1 s is generated at the middle of the flume and propagates to both lateral directions the value of k h 1 04 indicates the dispersive characteristic of the target wave the center of the source region is located in x 0 m and the width of the momentum source region is equal to the wavelength in the x direction wave damping zone is placed on the left side of the flume from x 4 0 m to x 8 0 m the right side of flume is a solid vertical wall to fully reflect the incident waves the schematic set up is shown in fig 1 the entire computational domain is discretized using a non uniform grid system the total computational grid number is 940 125 the minimum grid spacing is δ x 1 0 10 2 m and δ y 1 0 10 3 m the total simulation time is 15 s and the time step d t in this case is 1 0 10 3 s in an ideal situation the total reflection will happen and a standing wave can be generated between the source region and the right wall if there is no interaction between the reflected wave and the momentum source region the reflected wave would pass through the source region and propagate to the left with the same wave height and frequency but different phases as the incident wave propagating to the left of the flume in the end they are both absorbed in the damping zone the wave forms at the right side standing wave and left side propagating wave of the source region can be expressed by the linear wave theory 24 η r i g h t η i η r a cos k x ω t a cos k x ω t 2 a cos k x cos w t 25 η l e f t a cos k x ω t a cos k x ω t φ where η r i g h t and η l e f t are the wave surface elevations in the right and left region respectively η i and η r represent the incident and reflected wave elevation respectively φ is the phase difference between two waves in the left region in this case the phase difference can be computed through the propagating distance fig 2 shows the process of free surface variation from 12 35 s to 13 25 s the stable standing waves are obtained at t 12 65s and 13 15s fig 3 represents the whole free surface trajectories from 12 35 s to 13 25 s at time interval of 0 1 t when the stable waveform has been formed it can be seen that the entire domain can be divided into four regions from right to left the standing wave region the mixing wave region the traveling wave region and the absorbing wave region in the standing wave region the wave envelope is twice the incident wave which is corresponding with the theoretical solutions the mixing region is found around the wave maker region where the reflected wave and incident wave coexist however the reflected wave does not affect the source wave maker because the stable standing waveform is generated the wave profile in the traveling wave region is formed by the superposition of the two propagating waves in the absorbing wave region the wave height decreases to nearly zero in front of the left wall which can demonstrate the efficiency of wave sponge layer 3 2 regular wave propagating over a submerged breakwater submerged breakwaters are very common and crucial structures in ocean engineering which can maintain the steady water surface and protect the offshore region from damage the interaction between the structures and waves is a classical and hot topic among coastal researchers due to the complex wave wave and wave structure interactions beji and battjes 1993 ohyama et al 1995 ting et al 2016 ning et al 2016 chen et al 2016 the classical experiment of beji and battjes 1993 is numerically represented in this section fig 4 shows the schematic diagram of the numerical wave tank which is 36 00 m long from x 9 m 27 m the center of the internal wave maker is located in x 0 m numerical sponge layers with the width of 8 m are placed on both sides of the flume to absorb transmitted and reflected waves the constant water depth h 0 40 m a trapezoid breakwater is placed in the region x 3 5 m 14 5 m with a front slope of 1 20 and back slope of 1 10 the incident wave with the wave height of h 0 02 m and period of t 2 02s corresponding to the dispersion parameter k h 0 67 is generated in the flume six measuring points a f are employed to record the waveform evolution located at x 8 0 m 10 0 m 11 0 m 12 0 m 13 2 m and 14 8 m respectively the entire computational domain is discretized using a non uniform grid system the total computational grid number is 990 122 the minimum grid spacing is δ x 2 0 10 2 m and δ y 2 0 10 3 m the total simulation time is 40 s the time step d t in this case is 2 0 10 3 s which is dynamically determined by the criterion of cfl number in fig 5 a f wave surface profiles at six wave gauges are compared with the experimental data of beji and battjes 1993 and numerical results of liu et al 2015 due to the effect of wave shoaling the wave height is higher than the incident wave before approaching the top of the breakwater in fig 5 a and b when the waves propagate over the top of the breakwater the wave energy is redistributed to high order harmonics and the waveforms in fig 5 c and d become extremely asymmetric after propagating over the breakwater the harmonic effect becomes stronger and the high order harmonics wave gains more energy from the main wave shown at the gauge fig 5 e and f compared with the experimental data the present results show the excellent agreements at all wave gauges meanwhile the present results of cip based internal wave maker is observed to be more stable and accurate on wave profile when compared with isph results especially at gauge b to f in fig 5 where strong non linearity and decomposition occur all the above can show the ability of the cip based model to solve the problem of wave and a submerged breakwater interaction 4 model validations and applications for focused waves in this section focused waves are generated by the spatio temporal focusing model proposed by davis and zarnick 1966 a new physical experiment is carried out to validate the numerical model the generation of the focused wave and the wave wave interaction are studied furthermore the variations of free surface and wave energy structure are presented when the focused waves pass through a submerged breakwater 4 1 experiment the experiments are conducted in a glass wall wave flume at the ocean college of zhejiang university china the flume is 75 m long 1 8 m wide and 2 m high at one end a paddle type wave maker is employed to generate waves and wave damping region is adopted at the other end to absorb the reflected waves a trapezoid submerged breakwater 1 8 m wide 3 08 m long and 0 36 m high is installed 32 m away from the wave maker six wave gauges g1 g6 are placed along the central line to monitor the water wave profiles the experimental layout is shown in fig 6 it should be pointed out that the generation of the focused wave is first tested before placing the breakwater here the diagram of physical flume without structure is not shown in the study the focused positions are all set at g3 and a constant water depth h 0 0 5 m is used in all tests a series of experimental groups including different kinds of focused waves are produced here six cases with different wave heights and spectrum widths are chosen for detailed analysis the characteristics of the chosen focused wave groups are given in table 1 which are also used in the numerical simulations in each case the specified spectral information is used to control the appropriate paddle motion using linear transfer functions wave components are calculated by using the constant wave amplitude cwa shown as 26 s f a n f where f is the frequency of constituent waves s f is the power spectrum a is the amplitude of focused wave n f the total number of wave components here n f 29 4 2 the generation of focused wave in this part the proposed internal wave maker is applied to the generation of focused waves a 2 d numerical wave flume is set up to reproduce the cases described by experiments the computational domain is shown in fig 7 in order to save cpu time a smaller numerical tank 32 0 m rather than the physical wave tank 75 0 m is used the entire computational domain is discretized using a non uniform grid system the total computational grid number is 400 100 the minimum grid spacing is δ x 5 0 10 2 m and δ y 5 0 10 3 m the time step in this case is 5 0 10 4 s which is dynamically determined by the criterion of cfl number the total simulation time is up to 30 s and the focused time is at t f 20 s the sensitivity of relevant parameter in the momentum source term is investigated furthermore the variations of free surface and wave wave interaction are shown 4 2 1 the effect of wave maker region width for the momentum source wave maker the source width is the only parameter which has a great effect on the generation of monochromatic waves liu et al 2015 ye et al 2017 according to ye et al 2017 the wave amplitude in the wave making region will increase with the decrease of the ratio of the wave making area width and wavelength w l when the ratio of wave making area width and wavelength decreases to a certain value it will have an impact on the calculation results however most studies on the width of wave making region only pay attention to monochromatic waves for focused wave it consists of different component waves and the wavelength of the each constituent wave is not same if a fixed width w is used the value of each constituent wave δ w l is different with each other for the longer wave the value δ is smaller considering about the above issues a self adaptive source region width method which can match different wave frequencies is proposed where δ is fixed to all the components waves to test the effect of source region width the case 3 and case 6 with different spectrum are chosen to analyze fixed w 0 5 m 1 0 m 2 0 m 3 0 m and 4 0 m which is about 25 50 100 150 and 200 of the wavelength of the central frequency wave and fixed δ 1 are simulated the results of free surface elevation at x 0 m and x g3 are shown in figs 8 and 9 fig 8 a shows the free surface elevation at x 0 m for case 3 it can be found that the surface elevations of w 0 5 m and 1 0 m are much larger than the others and the waveforms are very asymmetric from fig 8 b the focused wave amplitudes are also larger than others due to the smaller wave maker region there might be a larger wave peak occurring which affects the accuracy of results while for w 4 m the focusing group is generated in advance in fig 8 a in fig 8 b there is severe attenuation which means the too large width of wave maker region can not work well for δ 1 the surface elevation in fig 8 a is lower than others and in fig 8 b the surface elevation of δ 1 has a good agreement with the fixed w 2 0 m 3 0 m which shows the ability of the self adaptive source region width method the same trend can be seen in fig 9 which contains a wider frequency range waves from the above results we can see that the self adaptive source region width method can not only maintain the steady wave form in the wave making region but accurately represent the focused wave at a specific point therefore the self adaptive source region width method is used in the following simulations to generate the focused wave 4 2 2 the variation of free surface along the flume fig 10 shows the time histories of the focused wave propagation at six gauges g1 g6 respectively the simulated results agree well with experimental data in all cases except for small deviation in the cases of broad spectrum figs 11 and 12 illustrate the surface elevation at the focal point for the above cases it should be noted that in the figures shown below both the focal position and the focal time are shifted to zero in order to compare with linear solutions and experimental data from fig 11 a and fig 12 a the numerical results and experimental data for case 1 and case 4 agree well with the linear solution confirming that the nonlinearity is weak in the smallest input amplitude as the input amplitude increases the numerical results and experimental data diverge from the linear solution gradually which can be seen in fig 11 b c and fig 12 b c due to the strong nonlinear interactions between wave components the wave crest at the focal position becomes higher and narrower while the adjacent wave troughs become wider and less deep the whole wave envelope becomes steeper the present numerical results have a good agreement with experimental data especially in the focused amplitude however some small deviation is needed to be focused on the cases of broad spectrum shown in fig 12 a c which correspond with as fig 10 b d and f the momentum source wave function derived from the boussinesq type equations which is based on the depth averaged assumption has a challenge in the generation of very high frequency waves when encountering with wider spectrum some high frequency waves are taken into account these high frequency wave components are out of the k h limit according to the equations of nwogu 1993 this could be the reason that wider spectrum results in fig 12 has slightly larger error than fig 11 however the high frequency wave components take only low percentage of total energy level the overall agreement between numerical experimental and linear results is still satisfactory as the focused wave is assumed to be the linear sum of the individual wave components the effect of nonlinear wave wave interactions is omitted while due to the nonlinear wave wave interaction the actual focal position x f and focal time t f differ from the linear input values when a steep focused wave group evolves in the wave tank there is a downstream shifting of the focal position and time the shifts in the focal event is related to the extent of nonlinearity fig 13 shows the maximum crest elevations at the focal point for different input amplitudes we can see that with the input amplitude increasing the discrepancy between the input value and obtained value increases furthermore for the same input amplitude the deviation in the narrow spectrum is larger than that of broad spectrum the same regularity can be seen in fig 14 a and b which show the shifts of focal position and focal time due to nonlinear effects the downstream shift of the focus point becomes larger with the increase of the input wave amplitude this has been demonstrated both experimentally baldock et al 1996 johannessen and swan 2001 and theoretically longuet higgins 1974 in finite water depth the present results are compared with the classical experiment made by baldock et al 1996 and the same variation tendency is obtained 4 3 focused waves decomposition on a trapezoid breakwater a 2d numerical wave flume is set up to reproduce the interaction between the focused wave and a submerged breakwater the computational domain with a submerged breakwater placed at x 10 m is shown in fig 15 the entire computational domain is discretized using a non uniform grid system and the total computational grid number is 680 140 the x direction minimum grid size is 3 10 2 m and the y direction minimum grid size is 3 10 3 m time step d t is 5 10 4 s which is dynamically determined to satisfy the criterion of cfl number the total simulation time is up to 30 s and the focused time is t f 20 s fig 16 displays the variation of free surface when focused waves pass through the breakwater for the above cases the plots show the comparison between numerical and measured free surface elevation for six wave gauges g1 g6 respectively fig 16 a b show the variation of free surface for case 1 and case 4 with the focused amplitude of 0 03 m as the cases of weak non linearity both of them in the flume are non breaking due to the existence of breakwater the ratio of the wave height to the water depth increases and there is the shoaling effect occurring compared to fig 10 a b the focused waves at g3 and g4 are much larger in fig 16 a b furthermore the waveforms from g2 are extremely asymmetric and there are some small trailing waves occurring the numerical results in fig 16 a b generally show the good agreement with the physical experiments fig 16 c d show the propagation of focused wave groups for case 2 and case 5 with the focused height of 0 06 m due to the existence of the breakwater the water depth decreases sharply so that it can not afford the large wave and the waves break in the flume as the focused amplitude increases the non linearity of case 3 and case 6 increases the violent deformation of free surface can be seen in fig 16 e f some differences for the surrounding wave trains and the strong asymmetry around the main wave crests are observed after the main waveform it possibly arises from the strong wave non linearity and water air mixing in flow field furthermore the 3 d effects are not considered in the present numerical model which may cause some deviations between the physical data and numerical results however we are mostly interested in the whole propagation process all the above numerical results have the same trend with the experiment data which shows the present model can describe the whole process of focused wave propagation fairly well even when the focused waves are broken figs 17 19 display the energy spectrum evolution of focused wave along the wave tank for cases 1 3 for case 1 in fig 17 since focused waves in the flume do not break there is little energy dissipation however when the focused waves pass through the breakwater a part of energy in main frequency is transferred to high frequency which is the main reason causing the asymmetric waveforms in fig 16 a for case 2 focused waves are breaking when they pass through the breakwater and there is obvious energy dissipation in fig 18 due to the high nonlinearity a part of energy in main frequency is transferred to high and low frequency while for the case of the strongest non linearity in fig 19 most of the energy is dissipated and there is almost no energy transfer however some high frequency energy at g6 for experimental data can be observed in figs 18 and 19 which might be caused by reflection wave in the physical flume except that numerical results with the structure ws or without the structure ns in the flume show a reasonable agreement with the experimental data even when the waves are broken 5 summary and discussion in this paper the internal wave maker theory is applied to the cip based model a momentum source function derived from the boussinesq type equations is employed as the internal wave maker to generate periodic waves the reflected waves from structure could pass through the wave maker region and are finally absorbed by the sponge region placed in other side of the numerical flume a self adaptive source region method is proposed to optimize the width of the momentum source region to different wave conditions fully non linear regular and focused waves propagating in a wave tank as well as the interaction with a submerged breakwater are simulated to validate the ability of the proposed numerical flume the regular wave reflection from a vertical wall is first simulated for model validation in the working region the waveforms agree well with the theoretical envelope lines and in the damping region the wave height decreases to nearly zero then the regular wave decomposition on a trapezoid breakwater is simulated for a long time quite stable wave profiles are obtained without the effect of secondary wave reflection the present results are compared with the experimental data as well as other numerical results good agreements are obtained the focused waves are finally employed to validate the application of the proposed model to different frequency waves the effect of wave maker region width is analyzed it has been found that the fixed wave maker region width can not work well in the generation of focused wave a self adaptive source region method proposed to match different wave frequencies can effectively prevent the broken phenomenon in the wave making region the decomposition of focused waves on a submerged breakwater is studied no matter non broken or broken focused wave the numerical wave profiles as well as the energy variation agree wll with experimental data which shows the accuracy of internal wave maker model in conclusion the non reflection wave generation technique can be efficiently coupled with the cip based model it can serve as a powerful tool to generate different waves and study the wave structure interaction in coastal engineering however due to the depth averaged characteristics the momentum source function derived from the boussinesq type equations has a challenge in the generation of very high frequency waves this can be found in the generation of the focused wave with a broad spectrum further improvement on the momentum source function is needed in the future to break the current barrier of k h 3 14 in navier stokes models besides the present model can only be used in a vertical 2 d domain due to the great cost of the computation in 3 d modeling the numerical results may lack 3 d effects compared to the physical experiment in the future a 3 d cip based model should be expanded based on the present internal wave making algorithm acknowledgement this study was partially supported by the national

different wave conditions the proposed model is applied to different cases test of regular wave reflection from a vertical wall is first carried out regular wave decomposition over a submerged breakwater is then simulated focused wave generation and propagation over a submerged breakwater are finally studied and compared with a newly performed experiment good agreements are obtained all the results indicate that the cip based model with a non reflection internal wave maker can work as a powerful tool to study wave structure interaction in coastal engineering keywords cip method momentum source function internal wave maker focused wave self adaptive source region method vof method 1 introduction understanding and prediction of the interaction between waves and structures are crucial for the design and protection of coastal structures when it comes to this kind of problems wave simulations are more convenient compared with physical experiment or field observation it can give comprehensive time history data in terms of waveforms flow velocity fields and energy variation to understand the evolution and impact mechanism with less costs and technical limitations wave generation plays an significant role in numerical wave flumes during the development of wave simulation there are many kinds of methods for wave generation in numerical models such as internal wave maker lin and liu 1999 choi and yoon 2009 moving boundary wave maker higuera 2015 and velocity boundary wave maker higuera et al 2013 troch and de rouck 1999 when it refers to wave structure interaction one of the key challenge for numerical wave models is to maintain the incident wave well and eliminate unwanted reflected waves from structures however when using the moving boundary wave maker or velocity boundary wave maker the reflected waves from the structure will propagate towards the wave maker boundary and then be reflected in a long time simulation the subsequent incident wave could be strongly affected by the secondary reflected wave which would greatly contaminate the modeling results many numerical techniques have been developed to overcome this problem one popular method is adopting a generating absorbing layer troch and de rouck 1999 to absorb the secondary reflection wave however when considering the high nonlinear waves the implement of the generating absorbing layer will have great difficulties due to the assumption of the linear superposition for incident and reflected waves besides the accumulation of errors caused by this type of boundary condition may eventually contaminate numerical results in a long time simulation wei and kirby 1995 while for the internal wave maker waves can be generated from a region inside the numerical flume and be absorbed at the two ends of the flume hence the reflected waves from the structure can pass through the wave maker region without affecting the wave generation and are finally absorbed by the sponge layers in this way the effect of re reflection in a long time simulation can be avoided two kinds of internal wave maker theories have been developed including mass source and momentum source approaches larsen and dancy 1983 first introduced the idea of the internal wave maker which numerically generates waves by employing a line source to the boussinesq type equations in shallow water condition lee and suh 1998 developed a similar approach based on the mild slope equations and studied the mass and energy transports of the generated wave lin and liu 1999 first proposed an internal wave maker which added mass source function to a navier stokes equations based model and different types of the waves were generated furthermore wei et al 1999 derived the relationship between the free surface and a momentum source function and proposed a momentum source wave generation method based on the boussinesq equations choi and yoon 2009 first used the idea of wei et al 1999 and successfully generated periodic waves in a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations based model ha et al 2013 added the momentum source wave maker to a navier stokes based model and employed frequency and directional spectra to generated directional monochromatic and irregular waves in three dimensions liu et al 2015 added a momentum source internal wave maker based on an incompressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics isph model and investigated the sensitivities of source region width in different monochromatic waves chen and hsiao 2016 generated 3d water waves using mass source wave maker in a navier stokes model and verified the capability of the numerical sponge layers great achievements have been obtained however studies on the wave maker source region width were rare and most of them only focused on the monochromatic wave there is no doubt that the width of wave maker source region has a great effect on the wave generation so further investigation is needed to study the effect of the wave maker source region width on different wave conditions recently numerical simulations of water waves based on the navier stokes equations have been developed remarkably for the capability of fully reproducing wave characteristics compared with conventional wave models based on the assumptions of depth averaged or potential flow theories the numerical model based on navier stokes equations has significant advantages because it can solve the corresponding mathematic equations without any simplification and represent the complex water wave dynamic problems such as violent free surface flow wave breaking and wave structure interaction accurately there are two main methods in navier stokes based model one is the mesh free methods such as the smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method monaghan 1994 or the moving particle semi implicit mps method koshizuka and oka 1996 however the mesh free methods are limited by their oscillations in the pressure field and the low computational efficiency as a consequence improved versions and promising results are currently available xu and deng 2016 perez and garcia 2017 another is the mesh based methods such as the volume of fluid vof approach hirt and nichols 1981 however the discretization of the advection equation using the mesh based methods always causes numerical diffusion moraga et al 2015 to improve the above problem various schemes have been proposed within the framework of the finite difference method high order resolution schemes have been developed the constrained interpolation profile cip method was first proposed by takewaki et al 1985 in order to reduce the numerical diffusion of low order finite difference method it was further used by yabe and aoki 1991 for solving hyperbolic equations the advantage of cip method is that it can provide a third order interpolation function in a single grid which makes it a compact high order scheme with less numerical diffusion it is found to be a powerful flow solver for the convective terms of navier stokes equations hu et al 2006 proposed a constrained interpolation profile cip scheme to simulate the extremely nonlinear phenomena such as water slamming on the deck of an advancing ship in waves hu and kashiwagi 2009 applied a cip based method to investigate the nonlinear wave body interaction problems involving violent free surface motions zhao and hu 2012 studied nonlinear interactions between extreme waves and floating body using an enhanced cip based model good results have been obtained with the cip based model however nearly all of them used paddle or velocity boundary wave maker and reflected wave from structures was solved by increasing the distance between wave maker and structure or adopting the active wave absorption which were carried out at the expense of computational efficiency therefore it is urgent to employ a new wave making strategy in the cip based model to solve the problem of re reflected waves when considering the interaction between waves and structures the purpose of this paper is to overcome the above mentioned limitations and supply more reliable results in wave modeling the momentum source function derived from the boussinesq equations choi and yoon 2009 will be employed in our cip based model a self adaptive source region method is proposed to optimize the width of the momentum source region to different wave conditions the efficiency and accuracy of the coupled internal wave maker and cip based model are verified by several benchmark wave simulations in addition to monochromatic waves the focused waves consisting of different component waves are carried out to verify the application of this model to different frequency waves the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the cip based numerical model with internal wave maker in section 3 regular wave propagation and reflection from a vertical wall are carried out meanwhile the high nonlinearity regular wave generation and decomposition over an impermeable breakwater are performed section 4 describes the process of focused wave generation and propagation over a submerged breakwater finally the paper is finished with some conclusions 2 numerical model with internal wave maker the computations presented in this paper are performed by means of a cip based model hu and kashiwagi 2004 zhao and hu 2012 the turbulence level in the test case is less important and the turbulence model is not considered here meanwhile surface tension is neglected in this study 2 1 governing equations the governing equations for two dimensional incompressible viscous fluid flow are mass conservation and navier stokes equations expressed as 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ x j μ u i x j g i

are the body forces for example gravity s i m are momentum source function and a b is damping term the wave structure interaction is treated as a multiphase problem that includes water air and solid body a volume fraction field ϕ m m 1 2 and 3 indicate water air and solid respectively is adopted to represent and capture the phase interface the evolution of the volume function is governed by 3 ϕ m t u i ϕ m x i 0 where ϕ m is set a range between 0 and 1 to overcome the instabilities at the interface the density and viscosity of liquid and solid are assumed to be the same the volume function for solid ϕ 3 is determined by a lagrangian method in which a fixed rigid body is assumed then the volume function for air ϕ 2 is determined by ϕ 2 1 ϕ 1 ϕ 3 after the volume function calculated the physical property λ such as the density ρ and viscosity μ in each grid can be defined as 4 λ m 1 3 ϕ m λ m 2 2 momentum source wave maker compared with the mass source term added to continuity equation the momentum source function added to the momentum equations is more convenient and stable to generate periodic waves due to less parameters ha et al 2013 in this paper the momentum source function is adopted to generate waves wei et al 1999 employed the linear boussinesq equations to derive the following mass source function from the continuity equation shown as 5 η t h u α 1 h 3 2 u f x y t 6 u t g η α h 2 2 u t s m x y t where η is the free surface displacement h is the water depth g is the gravitational acceleration u is the velocity vector f and s m are the mass and momentum source term the parameters in the above equations are determined by 7 α 1 α 1 3 8 α z α h z α 2 h 1 according to the extended boussinesq equation of nwogu 1993 u becomes a representative velocity vector at the position z α 0 530 h the position is chosen by the linear dispersion function according to this the above equations can be solved by green s function and the mass source function f is determined by wei et al 1999 and choi and yoon 2009 9 f x y t exp β x 2 4 π 2 d k y ω exp i k y y ω t d ω d k y 10 d h ω 2 α 1 g k 4 h 3 ω i 1 k 1 α k h 2 cos θ 11 i 1 π β exp k 2 4 β 12 β 80 δ 2 l 2 where d is the source function amplitude which can be determined from the desired wave characteristics β is the parameter associated with the width of source function δ 2 w l is a relevant parameter for the width of wave making region w is the width of source region ω k θ h l are the wave parameters of angular frequency wave number wave direction wave height and wave length respectively using the velocity potential and combining eqs 5 and 6 the momentum source function can be written as 13 s m g f d t so the x coordinate and y coordinate momentum source functions can be expressed as 14 s x m g 2 β x exp β x 2 1 4 π 2 i d k y ω ω exp i k y y ω t d ω d k y 15 s y m g exp β x 2 1 4 π 2 k y d k y ω ω exp i k y y ω t d ω d k y for the 2d linear monochromatic regular wave the momentum source

obtained by the linear superposition of monochromatic waves 17 s m g 2 β x exp β x 2 i 1 n d i ω i cos k i x x f ω i t t f where n is the number of wave components x f is the focusing position and t f is the focusing time 2 3 wave absorbing method the numerical sponge layer proposed by larsen and dancy 1983 is employed in this study to prevent the undesirable secondary wave reflections the efficiently absorbing coefficient a b is adopted from wei and kirby 1995 which has been proved the great ability by many studies lin and liu 2004 liu et al 2015 shown in the following equation 18 a b c α exp x x s t x a b n c 1 exp 1 1 where a b is the absorbing coefficient x s t and x a b are the starting position and length of the absorbing region respectively c α and n c are the empirical damping coefficients determined via the numerical test the damping coefficient must be defined inside the sponge layer and it is zero outside the sponge layer lin and liu 2004 used the empirical coefficients n c 10 and c 200 in their study which works very well in the rans based model in this study n c 10 and c α min 200 0 9 d t are adopted here d t is the computational time step instead of a constant value of c α a variable parameter is chosen to avoid negative values when the spatial and time steps are large 2 4 numerical implementations in this study a staggered grid system is used for the spatial discretization and a fractional method is applied to solve navier stokes equations the first step is to calculate the advection term as eq 19 shows 19 u i t u j u i x j 0 a cip approach is employed to solve the above equations yabe et al 2001 the basic principle of cip method is an interpolation in a grid by a cubic polynomial with the value and differential on the grid node 20 u i x x i u i δ t where x is the unknown coefficient function x i is the cubic polynomial to approximate the spatial profile of u i in an upwind cell the superscript denotes the intermediate time level after the advection step the second step is to solve the diffusion term momentum source term and damping term by a central difference scheme 21 u i u i δ t 1 ρ x j μ u i x j g i s i m a b where u i is the solution of this diffusion term in the end the pressure term is solved by the projection method 22 u i n 1 u i δ t ρ p n 1 x i 23 x i 1 ρ p n 1 x i 1 δ t u x i where the superscript n 1 denotes the new time the red black successive over relaxation approach sor is employed to solve the above poisson equation after the total flow field updated the free surface is captured by a volume of fluid vof type method the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing with slope weighting scheme thinc sw scheme compared with the original vof method the thinc sw scheme first proposed by xiao et al 2011 uses a smoothed heaviside function with a variable steepness parameter which can keep the sharpness of the interface and significantly improve the geometrical accuracy the solid boundary is treated by an immersed boundary method ibm proposed by peskin 1972 more details about the flow solver can be found in hu and kashiwagi 2004 and zhao et al 2014 3 model validations and applications for regular waves in this section the ability of the proposed model to generate regular waves is validated a series of numerical tests are carried out including monochromatic waves reflection from a vertical wall and the interaction between regular waves and a submerged breakwater numerical results are compared with available theoretical solutions or experimental results as well as other numerical results 3 1 wave reflection from a vertical wall wave reflection from a vertical wall has been extensively studied to validate the capability of a numerical model in terms of wave generation wave damping and the non reflection characteristics lin and liu 1999 choi and yoon 2009 liu et al 2015 hu et al 2015 in this part the cip model with momentum source internal wave maker will be applied to this problem in this simulation the still water depth h is 0 2 m and the channel is 13 m in length the monochromatic wave of amplitude a 0 005 m and period t 1 s is generated at the middle of the flume and propagates to both lateral directions the value of k h 1 04 indicates the dispersive characteristic of the target wave the center of the source region is located in x 0 m and the width of the momentum source region is equal to the wavelength in the x direction wave damping zone is placed on the left side of the flume from x 4 0 m to x 8 0 m the right side of flume is a solid vertical wall to fully reflect the incident waves the schematic set up is shown in fig 1 the entire computational domain is discretized using a non uniform grid system the total computational grid number is 940 125 the minimum grid spacing is δ x 1 0 10 2 m and δ y 1 0 10 3 m the total simulation time is 15 s and the time step d t in this case is 1 0 10 3 s in an ideal situation the total reflection will happen and a standing wave can be generated between the source region and the right wall if there is no interaction between the reflected wave and the momentum source region the reflected wave would pass through the source region and propagate to the left with the same wave height and frequency but different phases as the incident wave propagating to the left of the flume in the end they are both absorbed in the damping zone the wave forms at the right side standing wave and left side propagating wave of the source region can be expressed by the linear wave theory 24 η r i g h t η i η r a cos k x ω t a cos k x ω t 2 a cos k x cos w t 25 η l e f t a cos k x ω t a cos k x ω t φ where η r i g h t and η l e f t are the wave surface elevations in the right and left region respectively η i and η r represent the incident and reflected wave elevation respectively φ is the phase difference between two waves in the left region in this case the phase difference can be computed through the propagating distance fig 2 shows the process of free surface variation from 12 35 s to 13 25 s the stable standing waves are obtained at t 12 65s and 13 15s fig 3 represents the whole free surface trajectories from 12 35 s to 13 25 s at time interval of 0 1 t when the stable waveform has been formed it can be seen that the entire domain can be divided into four regions from right to left the standing wave region the mixing wave region the traveling wave region and the absorbing wave region in the standing wave region the wave envelope is twice the incident wave which is corresponding with the theoretical solutions the mixing region is found around the wave maker region where the reflected wave and incident wave coexist however the reflected wave does not affect the source wave maker because the stable standing waveform is generated the wave profile in the traveling wave region is formed by the superposition of the two propagating waves in the absorbing wave region the wave height decreases to nearly zero in front of the left wall which can demonstrate the efficiency of wave sponge layer 3 2 regular wave propagating over a submerged breakwater submerged breakwaters are very common and crucial structures in ocean engineering which can maintain the steady water surface and protect the offshore region from damage the interaction between the structures and waves is a classical and hot topic among coastal researchers due to the complex wave wave and wave structure interactions beji and battjes 1993 ohyama et al 1995 ting et al 2016 ning et al 2016 chen et al 2016 the classical experiment of beji and battjes 1993 is numerically represented in this section fig 4 shows the schematic diagram of the numerical wave tank which is 36 00 m long from x 9 m 27 m the center of the internal wave maker is located in x 0 m numerical sponge layers with the width of 8 m are placed on both sides of the flume to absorb transmitted and reflected waves the constant water depth h 0 40 m a trapezoid breakwater is placed in the region x 3 5 m 14 5 m with a front slope of 1 20 and back slope of 1 10 the incident wave with the wave height of h 0 02 m and period of t 2 02s corresponding to the dispersion parameter k h 0 67 is generated in the flume six measuring points a f are employed to record the waveform evolution located at x 8 0 m 10 0 m 11 0 m 12 0 m 13 2 m and 14 8 m respectively the entire computational domain is discretized using a non uniform grid system the total computational grid number is 990 122 the minimum grid spacing is δ x 2 0 10 2 m and δ y 2 0 10 3 m the total simulation time is 40 s the time step d t in this case is 2 0 10 3 s which is dynamically determined by the criterion of cfl number in fig 5 a f wave surface profiles at six wave gauges are compared with the experimental data of beji and battjes 1993 and numerical results of liu et al 2015 due to the effect of wave shoaling the wave height is higher than the incident wave before approaching the top of the breakwater in fig 5 a and b when the waves propagate over the top of the breakwater the wave energy is redistributed to high order harmonics and the waveforms in fig 5 c and d become extremely asymmetric after propagating over the breakwater the harmonic effect becomes stronger and the high order harmonics wave gains more energy from the main wave shown at the gauge fig 5 e and f compared with the experimental data the present results show the excellent agreements at all wave gauges meanwhile the present results of cip based internal wave maker is observed to be more stable and accurate on wave profile when compared with isph results especially at gauge b to f in fig 5 where strong non linearity and decomposition occur all the above can show the ability of the cip based model to solve the problem of wave and a submerged breakwater interaction 4 model validations and applications for focused waves in this section focused waves are generated by the spatio temporal focusing model proposed by davis and zarnick 1966 a new physical experiment is carried out to validate the numerical model the generation of the focused wave and the wave wave interaction are studied furthermore the variations of free surface and wave energy structure are presented when the focused waves pass through a submerged breakwater 4 1 experiment the experiments are conducted in a glass wall wave flume at the ocean college of zhejiang university china the flume is 75 m long 1 8 m wide and 2 m high at one end a paddle type wave maker is employed to generate waves and wave damping region is adopted at the other end to absorb the reflected waves a trapezoid submerged breakwater 1 8 m wide 3 08 m long and 0 36 m high is installed 32 m away from the wave maker six wave gauges g1 g6 are placed along the central line to monitor the water wave profiles the experimental layout is shown in fig 6 it should be pointed out that the generation of the focused wave is first tested before placing the breakwater here the diagram of physical flume without structure is not shown in the study the focused positions are all set at g3 and a constant water depth h 0 0 5 m is used in all tests a series of experimental groups including different kinds of focused waves are produced here six cases with different wave heights and spectrum widths are chosen for detailed analysis the characteristics of the chosen focused wave groups are given in table 1 which are also used in the numerical simulations in each case the specified spectral information is used to control the appropriate paddle motion using linear transfer functions wave components are calculated by using the constant wave amplitude cwa shown as 26 s f a n f where f is the frequency of constituent waves s f is the power spectrum a is the amplitude of focused wave n f the total number of wave components here n f 29 4 2 the generation of focused wave in this part the proposed internal wave maker is applied to the generation of focused waves a 2 d numerical wave flume is set up to reproduce the cases described by experiments the computational domain is shown in fig 7 in order to save cpu time a smaller numerical tank 32 0 m rather than the physical wave tank 75 0 m is used the entire computational domain is discretized using a non uniform grid system the total computational grid number is 400 100 the minimum grid spacing is δ x 5 0 10 2 m and δ y 5 0 10 3 m the time step in this case is 5 0 10 4 s which is dynamically determined by the criterion of cfl number the total simulation time is up to 30 s and the focused time is at t f 20 s the sensitivity of relevant parameter in the momentum source term is investigated furthermore the variations of free surface and wave wave interaction are shown 4 2 1 the effect of wave maker region width for the momentum source wave maker the source width is the only parameter which has a great effect on the generation of monochromatic waves liu et al 2015 ye et al 2017 according to ye et al 2017 the wave amplitude in the wave making region will increase with the decrease of the ratio of the wave making area width and wavelength w l when the ratio of wave making area width and wavelength decreases to a certain value it will have an impact on the calculation results however most studies on the width of wave making region only pay attention to monochromatic waves for focused wave it consists of different component waves and the wavelength of the each constituent wave is not same if a fixed width w is used the value of each constituent wave δ w l is different with each other for the longer wave the value δ is smaller considering about the above issues a self adaptive source region width method which can match different wave frequencies is proposed where δ is fixed to all the components waves to test the effect of source region width the case 3 and case 6 with different spectrum are chosen to analyze fixed w 0 5 m 1 0 m 2 0 m 3 0 m and 4 0 m which is about 25 50 100 150 and 200 of the wavelength of the central frequency wave and fixed δ 1 are simulated the results of free surface elevation at x 0 m and x g3 are shown in figs 8 and 9 fig 8 a shows the free surface elevation at x 0 m for case 3 it can be found that the surface elevations of w 0 5 m and 1 0 m are much larger than the others and the waveforms are very asymmetric from fig 8 b the focused wave amplitudes are also larger than others due to the smaller wave maker region there might be a larger wave peak occurring which affects the accuracy of results while for w 4 m the focusing group is generated in advance in fig 8 a in fig 8 b there is severe attenuation which means the too large width of wave maker region can not work well for δ 1 the surface elevation in fig 8 a is lower than others and in fig 8 b the surface elevation of δ 1 has a good agreement with the fixed w 2 0 m 3 0 m which shows the ability of the self adaptive source region width method the same trend can be seen in fig 9 which contains a wider frequency range waves from the above results we can see that the self adaptive source region width method can not only maintain the steady wave form in the wave making region but accurately represent the focused wave at a specific point therefore the self adaptive source region width method is used in the following simulations to generate the focused wave 4 2 2 the variation of free surface along the flume fig 10 shows the time histories of the focused wave propagation at six gauges g1 g6 respectively the simulated results agree well with experimental data in all cases except for small deviation in the cases of broad spectrum figs 11 and 12 illustrate the surface elevation at the focal point for the above cases it should be noted that in the figures shown below both the focal position and the focal time are shifted to zero in order to compare with linear solutions and experimental data from fig 11 a and fig 12 a the numerical results and experimental data for case 1 and case 4 agree well with the linear solution confirming that the nonlinearity is weak in the smallest input amplitude as the input amplitude increases the numerical results and experimental data diverge from the linear solution gradually which can be seen in fig 11 b c and fig 12 b c due to the strong nonlinear interactions between wave components the wave crest at the focal position becomes higher and narrower while the adjacent wave troughs become wider and less deep the whole wave envelope becomes steeper the present numerical results have a good agreement with experimental data especially in the focused amplitude however some small deviation is needed to be focused on the cases of broad spectrum shown in fig 12 a c which correspond with as fig 10 b d and f the momentum source wave function derived from the boussinesq type equations which is based on the depth averaged assumption has a challenge in the generation of very high frequency waves when encountering with wider spectrum some high frequency waves are taken into account these high frequency wave components are out of the k h limit according to the equations of nwogu 1993 this could be the reason that wider spectrum results in fig 12 has slightly larger error than fig 11 however the high frequency wave components take only low percentage of total energy level the overall agreement between numerical experimental and linear results is still satisfactory as the focused wave is assumed to be the linear sum of the individual wave components the effect of nonlinear wave wave interactions is omitted while due to the nonlinear wave wave interaction the actual focal position x f and focal time t f differ from the linear input values when a steep focused wave group evolves in the wave tank there is a downstream shifting of the focal position and time the shifts in the focal event is related to the extent of nonlinearity fig 13 shows the maximum crest elevations at the focal point for different input amplitudes we can see that with the input amplitude increasing the discrepancy between the input value and obtained value increases furthermore for the same input amplitude the deviation in the narrow spectrum is larger than that of broad spectrum the same regularity can be seen in fig 14 a and b which show the shifts of focal position and focal time due to nonlinear effects the downstream shift of the focus point becomes larger with the increase of the input wave amplitude this has been demonstrated both experimentally baldock et al 1996 johannessen and swan 2001 and theoretically longuet higgins 1974 in finite water depth the present results are compared with the classical experiment made by baldock et al 1996 and the same variation tendency is obtained 4 3 focused waves decomposition on a trapezoid breakwater a 2d numerical wave flume is set up to reproduce the interaction between the focused wave and a submerged breakwater the computational domain with a submerged breakwater placed at x 10 m is shown in fig 15 the entire computational domain is discretized using a non uniform grid system and the total computational grid number is 680 140 the x direction minimum grid size is 3 10 2 m and the y direction minimum grid size is 3 10 3 m time step d t is 5 10 4 s which is dynamically determined to satisfy the criterion of cfl number the total simulation time is up to 30 s and the focused time is t f 20 s fig 16 displays the variation of free surface when focused waves pass through the breakwater for the above cases the plots show the comparison between numerical and measured free surface elevation for six wave gauges g1 g6 respectively fig 16 a b show the variation of free surface for case 1 and case 4 with the focused amplitude of 0 03 m as the cases of weak non linearity both of them in the flume are non breaking due to the existence of breakwater the ratio of the wave height to the water depth increases and there is the shoaling effect occurring compared to fig 10 a b the focused waves at g3 and g4 are much larger in fig 16 a b furthermore the waveforms from g2 are extremely asymmetric and there are some small trailing waves occurring the numerical results in fig 16 a b generally show the good agreement with the physical experiments fig 16 c d show the propagation of focused wave groups for case 2 and case 5 with the focused height of 0 06 m due to the existence of the breakwater the water depth decreases sharply so that it can not afford the large wave and the waves break in the flume as the focused amplitude increases the non linearity of case 3 and case 6 increases the violent deformation of free surface can be seen in fig 16 e f some differences for the surrounding wave trains and the strong asymmetry around the main wave crests are observed after the main waveform it possibly arises from the strong wave non linearity and water air mixing in flow field furthermore the 3 d effects are not considered in the present numerical model which may cause some deviations between the physical data and numerical results however we are mostly interested in the whole propagation process all the above numerical results have the same trend with the experiment data which shows the present model can describe the whole process of focused wave propagation fairly well even when the focused waves are broken figs 17 19 display the energy spectrum evolution of focused wave along the wave tank for cases 1 3 for case 1 in fig 17 since focused waves in the flume do not break there is little energy dissipation however when the focused waves pass through the breakwater a part of energy in main frequency is transferred to high frequency which is the main reason causing the asymmetric waveforms in fig 16 a for case 2 focused waves are breaking when they pass through the breakwater and there is obvious energy dissipation in fig 18 due to the high nonlinearity a part of energy in main frequency is transferred to high and low frequency while for the case of the strongest non linearity in fig 19 most of the energy is dissipated and there is almost no energy transfer however some high frequency energy at g6 for experimental data can be observed in figs 18 and 19 which might be caused by reflection wave in the physical flume except that numerical results with the structure ws or without the structure ns in the flume show a reasonable agreement with the experimental data even when the waves are broken 5 summary and discussion in this paper the internal wave maker theory is applied to the cip based model a momentum source function derived from the boussinesq type equations is employed as the internal wave maker to generate periodic waves the reflected waves from structure could pass through the wave maker region and are finally absorbed by the sponge region placed in other side of the numerical flume a self adaptive source region method is proposed to optimize the width of the momentum source region to different wave conditions fully non linear regular and focused waves propagating in a wave tank as well as the interaction with a submerged breakwater are simulated to validate the ability of the proposed numerical flume the regular wave reflection from a vertical wall is first simulated for model validation in the working region the waveforms agree well with the theoretical envelope lines and in the damping region the wave height decreases to nearly zero then the regular wave decomposition on a trapezoid breakwater is simulated for a long time quite stable wave profiles are obtained without the effect of secondary wave reflection the present results are compared with the experimental data as well as other numerical results good agreements are obtained the focused waves are finally employed to validate the application of the proposed model to different frequency waves the effect of wave maker region width is analyzed it has been found that the fixed wave maker region width can not work well in the generation of focused wave a self adaptive source region method proposed to match different wave frequencies can effectively prevent the broken phenomenon in the wave making region the decomposition of focused waves on a submerged breakwater is studied no matter non broken or broken focused wave the numerical wave profiles as well as the energy variation agree wll with experimental data which shows the accuracy of internal wave maker model in conclusion the non reflection wave generation technique can be efficiently coupled with the cip based model it can serve as a powerful tool to generate different waves and study the wave structure interaction in coastal engineering however due to the depth averaged characteristics the momentum source function derived from the boussinesq type equations has a challenge in the generation of very high frequency waves this can be found in the generation of the focused wave with a broad spectrum further improvement on the momentum source function is needed in the future to break the current barrier of k h 3 14 in navier stokes models besides the present model can only be used in a vertical 2 d domain due to the great cost of the computation in 3 d modeling the numerical results may lack 3 d effects compared to the physical experiment in the future a 3 d cip based model should be expanded based on the present internal wave making algorithm acknowledgement this study was partially supported by the national

seasonal winds of the indian subcontinent during summer has caused chabahar to be the coolest seaport in winter and warmest one in summer shirinmanesh and chegini 2011 the present study was conducted using the hourly data of the region related to 7 2 2007 to 7 3 2007 and daily data related to 21 3 2007 to 19 3 2012 the data used in this study included speed and direction of wind speed of hurricane air pressure and temperature water temperature moisture and wave height which have been recorded by the wave buoys in chabahar region table 2 2 1 symbiotic organisms search sos algorithm the sos algorithm is a metaheuristic algorithm based on the simulation of mutual behaviors of the organisms cheng and prayogo 2014 this algorithm is started with an initial population called ecosystem in the initial ecosystem a group of organisms decision variable is randomly produced in the search space each living organism as a suggestion for solution of the problem indicates the degree of adaptability with the given objective value of the objective function in sos generation of a new solution is administered by imitation of the biologic interaction between two organisms in the ecosystem three phases of mutualism mutual use commensalism and parasitism which is similar to the biological interactive model in the real world are introduced cheng and prayogo 2014 the overall process of this algorithm is as follows initialization repeat mutualism phase commensalism phase parasitism phase termination criterion is met the overall process of sos algorithm is represented in fig 2 2 1 1 mutualism phase in sos the organism x i k is a k dimensional organism number of decision variables that is compatible with the i th member of the environment population the value of i using a loop is initiated from 1 and continues up to the population size i 1 2 n the parameter k indicates the existing dimensions or in other words the number of decision variables of the problem furthermore the organism x j k using the rand command is randomly selected for cooperation with the organism x i k both organisms in the interaction participate in the ecosystem with the aim of increasing the advantages of mutual survival the new solution for x i k and x j k are calculated based on the interactive mutualism between x i k and x j k using equations 1 and 2 1 x inew k x i k rand 0 1 x best mutual vector bf 1 2 x jnew k x j k rand 0 1 x best mutual vector bf 2 3 mutual vector x i k x j k 2 where x i k and x j k are the k dimensional organisms that are compatible with the ith and jth member of the environment besides xbest is the best member of the population mutual vector is the mutualism or mutual vector and rand 0 1 is a vector of the random numbers here the profit factor bf1 and bf2 has been randomly defined in equations 1 and 2 this factor indicates each organism s profitability level meaning that whether an organism achieves a complete profit or only a portion of the profit values of the profit factor are calculated using equations 4 and 5 4 bf 1 round 1 rand 5 bf 2 round 1 rand where rand is a random number between 0 and 1 equation 3 shows a vector that is called mutual vector and indicates characteristics of the relationship between x i k and x j k a part of the relationship xbest mutual vector bf1 refers to the interactive effect and indicates the degree of survival that can be achieved through this interaction and mutualism here the objective is to achieve xbest because xbest has got the highest adaptability with the optimal global point thus xbest global solution is used to model the highest degree of adaptability as the final point and increase the fitness of both organisms finally an organism is adapted when its new value of fitness is higher than its pre interaction fitness value 2 1 2 commensalism phase similar to the mutual interaction the organism x j k is randomly selected from the ecosystem related to the organism x i k under such conditions the organism x i k tries to achieve the highest profit from this relationship while he organism x j k neither achieves profit nor undergoes loss the new solution of x i k is calculated based on the commensalism symbiosis between the organisms x i k and x j k using equation 6 based on the laws dominating the nature the organism x i k is adapted only when its new value of fitness is better than its pre interaction fitness value 6 x inew k x i k rand 1 1 x best x j k the section xbest xj k refers to the profit created by xj k to help xi k increase its chance of survival in the current ecosystem 2 1 3 parasitism phase in sos the organism x i k plays a role similar to that of anopheles by creating an artificial parasite called parasite vector the parasite vector is created in the search space by reproducing the organism x i k then the changes are applied on it based on the random selection and using a random number the organism x j k is selected randomly from the ecosystem as the host the parasite vector attempts to displace the organism x j k within the ecosystem both organisms x i k and x j k are evaluated by measuring their degree of fitness objective function value if the parasite vector has higher fitness then it will kill the organism x j k and occupy its position in the ecosystem however if the organism x j k has higher fitness then x j k will be secure against the parasite and the parasite vector will have no more capability to live in that ecosystem and thus will have no place there 2 2 other methods as previously mentioned in order to evaluate the sos algorithm s ability its results were compared with those of pso eberhart and kennedy 1995 and ica atashpaz gargari and lucas 2007 algorithms and intelligent methods including svr vapnik et al 1997 ann holland 1992 and swan dynamic model booij et al 1997 2 3 data preprocessing and evaluation criteria preprocessing includes selection of the effective variables selection of the training and testing patterns and normalization non dimensionalization of data principally importing the raw data would result in the reduced speed and accuracy of the problem in order to avoid such conditions and equalize values of the data to be imported in the model normalization of the patterns is commonly a conversion in which the data are mapped from their real value to a certain range such as 0 1 in the present study all the input data were normalized before being imported using equation 7 7 z i x i x min x max x min where xi is the observed value at the ith time step xmax is the maximum observational value and xmin is the minimum observational value in this study the objective function was defined as minimization of ssq between the observational and computational data in accordance with equation 8 8 minimize of t 1 n o t s t 2 where n is the number of time steps and ot and st indicate the wave height respectively observed and calculated by the studied algorithms computational at time t in order to evaluate the given models the statistical indices of r2 rmse mae mse nmse mape ssq and willmott s index of agreement were used which are presented in equations 9 16 willmott 1981 9

and n is the number of observations the variation domain of willmott s index of agreement ranges from to 1 so that 1 indicates the perfect agreement between the observational and computational data the low value of rmse and the high value of r2 which is close to 1 indicate acceptable accuracy of the model and correlation between the data and also imply its superiority over the other model each of the mae mse nmse ssq and mape parameters shows the difference between the observational and computational data indicating that the lower these values the more efficient the process mse bolds the difference between the data and its normalized form would be capable of comparing with other methods willmott 1981 3 results and discussion to achieve reliable and precise results in a specific region the sos algorithm needs to be calibrated before using like other predicting or simulating models for calibration the regional data is used more the data more the model accuracy however the sos algorithm is capable to produce acceptable results even with more limited data in the present study the significant wave height was predicted by metaheuristic algorithms sos pso and ica intelligent

sos algorithm minimizes the differences of ssq between the observed wave height and the predicted wave height in accordance with equation 21 21 m i n i m i z e s s q i 1 n w h o b s w h c a l 2 table 4 represents the overall results of the wave height prediction by a number of different sos models as seen in table 4 the power model has a slight superiority over other investigated models in predicting the wave height which indicate its more appropriate performance in wave height prediction after confirming the superiority of nonlinear model effect of different lag times 1 day 2 days 3 days on the performance of sos algorithm was investigated as shown in table 5 it was found that as the lag time increases the algorithm performance decreases the best results were obtained by 1 day lag time 3 1 hourly wave height prediction values of the matrix of coefficients a and matrix of powers b which have been optimized by the investigated algorithms are presented in tables 6 and 7 as seen in tables 6 and 7 regarding the wave height coefficient with 1 h delay in all the investigated algorithms it can be inferred that this parameter has the most effect on the hourly wave height prediction next to this parameter the wind speed which is resulted from the investigated algorithms is the most effective parameter in the sea wave height prediction fig 3 shows the observed and predicted wave height values using the sos algorithm in hourly time range as seen in fig 3 all the investigated metaheuristic algorithms had acceptable performance in predicting the sea wave height so that the determination coefficient in all the three algorithms has been obtained higher than 0 95 furthermore the sos algorithm with determination coefficient of 0 9513 had a slight superiority over the two other algorithms in predicting the sea wave height in hourly time range fig 4 shows the observed and predicted wave height values by the sos algorithm versus each other as seen in fig 4 the data are mainly concentrated on the bisector line which indicates the high precision of sos algorithm in the hourly sea wave height prediction in chabahar region 3 2 daily wave height prediction based on the results presented in tables 8 and 9 it is observed that the wave height coefficient with 1 h delay in all the investigated algorithms has the highest effect on the hourly wave height prediction next to this parameter the wind speed with positive coefficients is the most effective parameter in the sea wave height prediction fig 5 shows the values of wave height observed and predicted by the sos algorithm in a daily time range as seen in this figure the sos algorithm had acceptable performance in simulating and predicting the sea wave height among the investigated methods the sos algorithm with determination coefficient of 0 8607 had a better performance compared to the other methods in predicting the sea wave height in a daily time range fig 6 shows the wave height values observed and predicted by the sos algorithm in daily time range versus each other as seen in fig 6 the data are to some extent concentrated on the bisector line and the determination coefficient of 0 8607 indicates the acceptable performance of the sos algorithm in predicting the sea wave height in chabahar region based on the simulations and comparison of them in two hourly and daily time ranges it is observed that the investigated methods had better performance in hourly prediction than the daily one such accuracy indicates effectiveness of the exact and accurate data which are close to each other in terms of time in predicting the wave height furthermore such dependence of the methods on hourly data implies effectiveness of the parameters on each other in short term within the nature in this study the outputs of swan were used to train and obtain the parameters of sos the hybrid swan sos approach and then testified the obtained results using these parameters for sos this demonstrated remarkable results as presented in table 10 this procedure can be used in the areas where enough observations are lacking table 10 represents the overall results of the wave height prediction by

values of rmse mae mse nmse mape and willmott s index of agreement d are presented as well based on this table and these values the difference between the calculated and predicted values can be observed 4 conclusion the sos algorithm based model which had previously exhibited its accuracy and applicability for solving the multi objective constrained optimization and structure design optimization problems panda and pani 2016 tejani et al 2016 showed that it can have a good efficiency in predicting the wave height in two hourly and daily time ranges as well in the present study it was attempted to predict the wave height in two hourly and daily time ranges for the years 2006 and 2007 using the sos ica and pso metaheuristic algorithms ann and svr intelligent methods and swan dynamic model in order to apply the data for predicting the wave height using investigated methods first the data were normalized which accelerated the process and increased accuracy of the methods

9513 0 9507 0 9501 0 9477 0 9395 0 8496 and 0 9862 respectively for hourly time range and equal to 0 8607 0 8545 0 8538 0 8589 0 8437 0 8382 and 0 8608 respectively for daily time range based on the predictions and comparison of them in the two hourly and daily time ranges it is observed that the investigated methods were more successful in the hourly prediction than the daily prediction such accuracy indicates effectiveness of the precise data which are close to each other in terms of time on prediction of the wave height besides such dependence of the methods on hourly data implies effectiveness of the parameters on each other in short term within the nature the investigated algorithms had acceptable accuracy in predicting the extremum points which indicates their efficiency in predicting the hydrometeorological problems that haven t been much applied in this field so far furthermore the coefficients obtained from the investigated algorithms for experimental equation show effectiveness of factors such as wave height and wind speed with a unit of delay on the wave height the sos algorithm had a slight superiority over other investigated methods in predicting the wave

sos has simple structure and able to search well the globally optimum solution it is used to investigate the resulting outcomes for predicting the sea wave height problem in this paper also regarding the increasing necessity of predicting the phenomena with high degree of uncertainty such as sea wave height on the one hand and application of sos optimization algorithm in other sciences on the other hand the present study is aimed to investigate the efficiency of this algorithm in simulating the sea wave height with regard to the data measured by the buoy located in chabahar region for this purpose a model was developed based on the sos algorithm in the programming section of matlab software the results obtained from the developed models were evaluated using the statistical indices

willmott s index of agreement d furthermore results of the studied algorithm were compared with those of the pso and ica algorithms and intelligent methods including svr ann and swan dynamic model also the hybrid swan sos approach was used in the areas where enough observations are lacking it must be noted that all the studied algorithms were coded in matlab r 2014 a software 2 materials and methods chabahar region is located in southeastern iran at 25 20 n latitude and 60 27 e longitude based on domarton method of climate classification the study region has a dry climate chabahar gulf is the largest iranian gulf located at the margin of the sea of oman and is also the nearest waterway to indian ocean due to its ring like shape ω this gulf is considered as horseshoe or omega type in geology fig 1 demonstrates the position of this region this gulf s estuary width is about 13 5 km and it s length along the n s and e w directions in the deepest part is nearly 17 and 20 km respectively moreover area of the gulf is almost 320 km2 and it has a depth of nearly 7 m haghighi 1995 the average temperature of this region is 26 5 c and its location in the path of the monsoons seasonal winds of the indian subcontinent during summer has caused chabahar to be the coolest seaport in winter and warmest one in summer shirinmanesh and chegini 2011 the present study was conducted using the hourly data of the region related to 7 2 2007 to 7 3 2007 and daily data related to 21 3 2007 to 19 3 2012 the data used in this study included speed and direction of wind speed of hurricane air pressure and temperature water temperature moisture and wave height which have been recorded by the wave buoys in chabahar region table 2 2 1 symbiotic organisms search sos algorithm the sos algorithm is a metaheuristic algorithm based on the simulation of mutual behaviors of the organisms cheng and prayogo 2014 this algorithm is started with an initial population called ecosystem in the initial ecosystem a group of organisms decision variable is randomly produced in the search space each living organism as a suggestion for solution of the problem indicates the degree of adaptability with the given objective value of the objective function in sos generation of a new solution is administered by imitation of the biologic interaction between two organisms in the ecosystem three phases of mutualism mutual use commensalism and parasitism which is similar to the biological interactive model in the real world are introduced cheng and prayogo 2014 the overall process of this algorithm is as follows initialization repeat mutualism phase commensalism phase parasitism phase termination criterion is met the overall process of sos algorithm is represented in fig 2 2 1 1 mutualism phase in sos the organism x i k is a k dimensional organism number of decision variables that is compatible with the i th member of the environment population the value of i using a loop is initiated from 1 and continues up to the population size i 1 2 n the parameter k indicates the existing dimensions or in other words the number of decision variables of the problem furthermore the organism x j k using the rand command is randomly selected for cooperation with the organism x i k both organisms in the interaction participate in the ecosystem with the aim of increasing the advantages of mutual survival the new solution for x i k and x j k are calculated based on the interactive mutualism between x i k and x j k using equations 1 and 2 1 x inew k x i k rand 0 1 x best mutual vector bf 1 2 x jnew k x j k rand 0 1 x best mutual vector bf 2 3 mutual vector x i k x j k 2 where x i k and x j k are the k dimensional organisms that are compatible with the ith and jth member of the environment besides xbest is the best member of the population mutual vector is the mutualism or mutual vector and rand 0 1 is a vector of the random numbers here the profit factor bf1 and bf2 has been randomly defined in equations 1 and 2 this factor indicates each organism s profitability level meaning that whether an organism achieves a complete profit or only a portion of the profit values of the profit factor are calculated using equations 4 and 5 4 bf 1 round 1 rand 5 bf 2 round 1 rand where rand is a random number between 0 and 1 equation 3 shows a vector that is called mutual vector and indicates characteristics of the relationship between x i k and x j k a part of the relationship xbest mutual vector bf1 refers to the interactive effect and indicates the degree of survival that can be achieved through this interaction and mutualism here the objective is to achieve xbest because xbest has got the highest adaptability with the optimal global point thus xbest global solution is used to model the highest degree of adaptability as the final point and increase the fitness of both organisms finally an organism is adapted when its new value of fitness is higher than its pre interaction fitness value 2 1 2 commensalism phase similar to the mutual interaction the organism x j k is randomly selected from the ecosystem related to the organism x i k under such conditions the organism x i k tries to achieve the highest profit from this relationship while he organism x j k neither achieves profit nor undergoes loss the new solution of x i k is calculated based on the commensalism symbiosis between the organisms x i k and x j k using equation 6 based on the laws dominating the nature the organism x i k is adapted only when its new value of fitness is better than its pre interaction fitness value 6 x inew k x i k rand 1 1 x best x j k the section xbest xj k refers to the profit created by xj k to help xi k increase its chance of survival in the current ecosystem 2 1 3 parasitism phase in sos the organism x i k plays a role similar to that of anopheles by creating an artificial parasite called parasite vector the parasite vector is created in the search space by reproducing the organism x i k then the changes are applied on it based on the random selection and using a random number the organism x j k is selected randomly from the ecosystem as the host the parasite vector attempts to displace the organism x j k within the ecosystem both organisms x i k and x j k are evaluated by measuring their degree of fitness objective function value if the parasite vector has higher fitness then it will kill the organism x j k and occupy its position in the ecosystem however if the organism x j k has higher fitness then x j k will be secure against the parasite and the parasite vector will have no more capability to live in that ecosystem and thus will have no place there 2 2 other methods as previously mentioned in order to evaluate the sos algorithm s ability its results were compared with those of pso eberhart and kennedy 1995 and ica atashpaz gargari and lucas 2007 algorithms and intelligent methods including svr vapnik et al 1997 ann holland 1992 and swan dynamic model booij et al 1997 2 3 data preprocessing and evaluation criteria preprocessing includes selection of the effective variables selection of the training and testing patterns and normalization non dimensionalization of data principally importing the raw data would result in the reduced speed and accuracy of the problem in order to avoid such conditions and equalize values of the data to be imported in the model normalization of the patterns is commonly a conversion in which the data are mapped from their real value to a certain range such as 0 1 in the present study all the input data were normalized before being imported using equation 7 7 z i x i x min x max x min where xi is the observed value at the ith time step xmax is the maximum observational value and xmin is the minimum observational value in this study the objective function was defined as minimization of ssq between the observational and computational data in accordance with equation 8 8 minimize of t 1 n o t s t 2 where n is the number of time steps and ot and st indicate the wave height respectively observed and calculated by the studied algorithms computational at time t in order to evaluate the given models the statistical indices of r2 rmse mae mse nmse mape ssq and willmott s index of agreement were used which are presented in equations 9 16 willmott 1981 9

and n is the number of observations the variation domain of willmott s index of agreement ranges from to 1 so that 1 indicates the perfect agreement between the observational and computational data the low value of rmse and the high value of r2 which is close to 1 indicate acceptable accuracy of the model and correlation between the data and also imply its superiority over the other model each of the mae mse nmse ssq and mape parameters shows the difference between the observational and computational data indicating that the lower these values the more efficient the process mse bolds the difference between the data and its normalized form would be capable of comparing with other methods willmott 1981 3 results and discussion to achieve reliable and precise results in a specific region the sos algorithm needs to be calibrated before using like other predicting or simulating models for calibration the regional data is used more the data more the model accuracy however the sos algorithm is capable to produce acceptable results even with more limited data in the present study the significant wave height was predicted by metaheuristic algorithms sos pso and ica intelligent methods ann and svr dynamic model swan and hybrid swan sos model using the hourly wave height data recorded by the wave buoy of the ports and maritime organization of iran as well as the hydrometeorological data including wind speed and direction hurricane speed air pressure and temperature water temperature and moisture the swan dynamic model settings and boundary conditions have been presented in table 3 in this study four prediction models including linear eq 17 exponential eq 18 power eq 19 and nonlinear eq 20 equations were used for calculating the wave height by

sos algorithm minimizes the differences of ssq between the observed wave height and the predicted wave height in accordance with equation 21 21 m i n i m i z e s s q i 1 n w h o b s w h c a l 2 table 4 represents the overall results of the wave height prediction by a number of different sos models as seen in table 4 the power model has a slight superiority over other investigated models in predicting the wave height which indicate its more appropriate performance in wave height prediction after confirming the superiority of nonlinear model effect of different lag times 1 day 2 days 3 days on the performance of sos algorithm was investigated as shown in table 5 it was found that as the lag time increases the algorithm performance decreases the best results were obtained by 1 day lag time 3 1 hourly wave height prediction values of the matrix of coefficients a and matrix of powers b which have been optimized by the investigated algorithms are presented in tables 6 and 7 as seen in tables 6 and 7 regarding the wave height coefficient with 1 h delay in all the investigated algorithms it can be inferred that this parameter has the most effect on the hourly wave height prediction next to this parameter the wind speed which is resulted from the investigated algorithms is the most effective parameter in the sea wave height prediction fig 3 shows the observed and predicted wave height values using the sos algorithm in hourly time range as seen in fig 3 all the investigated metaheuristic algorithms had acceptable performance in predicting the sea wave height so that the determination coefficient in all the three algorithms has been obtained higher than 0 95 furthermore the sos algorithm with determination coefficient of 0 9513 had a slight superiority over the two other algorithms in predicting the sea wave height in hourly time range fig 4 shows the observed and predicted wave height values by the sos algorithm versus each other as seen in fig 4 the data are mainly concentrated on the bisector line which indicates the high precision of sos algorithm in the hourly sea wave height prediction in chabahar region 3 2 daily wave height prediction based on the results presented in tables 8 and 9 it is observed that the wave height coefficient with 1 h delay in all the investigated algorithms has the highest effect on the hourly wave height prediction next to this parameter the wind speed with positive coefficients is the most effective parameter in the sea wave height prediction fig 5 shows the values of wave height observed and predicted by the sos algorithm in a daily time range as seen in this figure the sos algorithm had acceptable performance in simulating and predicting the sea wave height among the investigated methods the sos algorithm with determination coefficient of 0 8607 had a better performance compared to the other methods in predicting the sea wave height in a daily time range fig 6 shows the wave height values observed and predicted by the sos algorithm in daily time range versus each other as seen in fig 6 the data are to some extent concentrated on the bisector line and the determination coefficient of 0 8607 indicates the acceptable performance of the sos algorithm in predicting the sea wave height in chabahar region based on the simulations and comparison of them in two hourly and daily time ranges it is observed that the investigated methods had better performance in hourly prediction than the daily one such accuracy indicates effectiveness of the exact and accurate data which are close to each other in terms of time in predicting the wave height furthermore such dependence of the methods on hourly data implies effectiveness of the parameters on each other in short term within the nature in this study the outputs of swan were used to train and obtain the parameters of sos the hybrid swan sos approach and then testified the obtained results using these parameters for sos this demonstrated remarkable results as presented in table 10 this procedure can be used in the areas where enough observations are lacking table 10 represents the overall results of the wave height prediction by metaheuristic algorithms sos pso and ica intelligent methods ann and svr and dynamic model swan in two hourly and daily time ranges in this table in addition to the determination coefficient value r2 values of rmse mae mse nmse mape and willmott s index of agreement d are presented as well based on this table and these values the difference between the calculated and predicted values can be observed 4 conclusion the sos algorithm based model which had previously exhibited its accuracy and applicability for solving the multi objective constrained optimization and structure design optimization problems panda and pani 2016 tejani et al 2016 showed that it can have a good efficiency in predicting the wave height in two hourly and daily time ranges as well in the present study it was attempted to predict the wave height in two hourly and daily time ranges for the years 2006 and 2007 using the sos ica and pso metaheuristic algorithms ann and svr intelligent methods and swan dynamic model in order to apply the data for predicting the wave height using investigated methods first the data were normalized which accelerated the process and increased accuracy of the methods the obtained results indicated satisfactory performance of the sos algorithm in both time ranges so that the determination coefficient for sos pso ica svr ann swan and swan sos was obtained equal to 0 9513 0 9507 0 9501 0 9477 0 9395 0 8496 and 0 9862 respectively for hourly time range and equal to 0 8607 0 8545 0 8538 0 8589 0 8437 0 8382 and 0 8608 respectively for daily time range based on the predictions and comparison of them in the two hourly and daily time ranges it is observed that the investigated methods were more successful in the hourly prediction than the daily prediction such accuracy indicates effectiveness of the precise data which are close to each other in terms of time on prediction of the wave height besides such dependence of the methods on hourly data implies effectiveness of the parameters on each other in short term within the nature the investigated algorithms had acceptable accuracy in predicting the extremum points which indicates their efficiency in predicting the hydrometeorological problems that haven t been much applied in this field so far furthermore the coefficients obtained from the investigated algorithms for experimental equation show effectiveness of factors such as wave height and wind speed with a unit of delay on the wave height the sos algorithm had a slight superiority over other investigated methods in predicting the wave height which indicated its more appropriate performance in the wave height prediction furthermore the hybrid swan sos model indicated high performance in predicting the wave height for this region

23102,the monopile has been widely used to support offshore and coastal structures a series of centrifuge tests has been performed to investigate the bearing capacity of large diameter monopiles in sandy soil both static tests and cyclic tests have been conducted for open ended and close ended model piles and the effects of influence factors such as loading rates embedment depths and loading histories are considered the piles are then loaded by a sequence of compressive tensile loadings to estimate the tension capacity from which the shaft friction is derived the cyclic load tests are performed with five varying load intensities and the accumulated settlement is assessed the centrifuge tests indicate that the pile bearing capacity tends to increase with the initial penetration depth and the stress state of soil greatly influences the pile behavior the tensile shaft friction is smaller compared to the compression test the capacities of the piles reduce significantly under the axial cyclic load and the maximum cyclic load intensity should be limited to 75 of the ultimate bearing capacity the api design method is used to calibrate with the centrifuge test results the method overestimates the bearing capacity at larger depths and a conservative reduction factor is required keywords axial capacity centrifuge modelling cyclic behavior monopile sand offshore structure 1 introduction the use of large diameter monopiles as deep foundations for offshore structures and coastal facilities continues to be widespread due to the increased exploitation of ocean energy resources the offshore monopiles are typically hollow steel pipe piles with larger diameters negro et al 2017 in china more than 5000 pipe piles are used in the construction of hangzhou bay bridge yu and yang 2011 and the monopile supported intertidal wind turbine contributes for 56 69 of the installed wind capacity in europe the monopile foundation is the most widely used offshore wind foundation with a market share of 87 by the end of 2017 wang et al 2018a the monopiles are driven into the ground and provide considerable bearing capacities in service conditions new challenges are brought to the design of monopile foundation considering the requirements of deeper penetration depths and complex offshore soil conditions understanding the response of large diameter monopiles under axial loadings is essential for proposing proper design methods and ensuring safety in the service conditions the bearing mechanism of the monopile foundation is a complex problem involving large amount of uncertainties during the installation soil enters the pipe pile from the pile tip to form a soil plug and the behaviors of the soil plug significantly affect the pile bearing capacity the early design methods for predicting the bearing capacity of pipe pile were derived from the close ended piles in recent years more efforts have been put on the investigation of bearing behavior of monopiles and mechanisms of the soil plug de nicola and randolph 1997 lehane and gavin 2001 paik and salgado 2003 paik et al 2003 after driving if a pile is in the fully coring mode with the incremental filling ratio ifr equals to 1 soil enters the pile at the same rate to the same or higher level as the ground surface kikuchi et al 2007 if a pile is in the fully plug mode with the ifr equals to 0 the soil plug resists additional soil entering the pile and the pile behaves similarly as a close ended pile in the fully plug mode the plug capacity is estimated to be 68 of the base capacity of a close ended pile and the difference is attributed by the compressibility of the soil plug yu and yang 2011 in practice the ifr is between the two limiting values referring to partially plug mode the small diameter pipe pile and the larger embedment depth are assumed to facilitate the formation of soil plug paik et al 2003 therefore these factors have major impacts on the overall vertical bearing capacity of a large diameter pipe pile and they are necessary to be considered in the analysis of design methods researchers have put considerable efforts in investigating the bearing behaviors of the axially loaded monopiles han et al 2016 performed fully instrumented field test on a close ended pipe pile driven in a multilayered soil profile and both static and dynamic load tests were conducted the tests results were calibrated with several design methods lehane et al 1993 documented a set of field tests in examining the shaft friction of a pipe pile it was found that the position and initial state of soil had significant influence on the stress developed and the pile loading induced changes of radial effective stress the design recommendation was given to estimate the shaft resistance besides the field tests a series of large scale laboratory tests were performed to study the pile bearing capacity the base resistance of pipe piles are investigated by an instrumented model test conducted in a large testing chamber lehane and gavin 2001 the test assessed relative contributions of plug resistance and annular resistance to the overall base resistance for a pipe pile the base resistance had a direct relationship to the cone tip resistance and the ifr in addition centrifuge tests were performed to enrich the database de nicola and randolph 1997 nicola and randolph 1999 it was observed in the tests that the shaft friction degraded in tension tests compared to the compression tests the close ended pile experienced a larger degradation and the base resistance was correlated with the cone resistance recently the influence of soil plug in the dynamic responses of monopiles are investigated and an analytical model is proposed to predict the dynamic velocity response liu et al 2018 a series of field tests were performed in stratified soils to investigate the axial resistance of monopiles and the methods in predicting shaft frictions were put forward by correlating with the standard penetration test kou et al 2016 in previous research most of the tests were performed within short periods of time after installation but there is limited amount of open literature describing the monopile bearing capacity in a relatively longer term zakeri et al 2014 the bearing capacity of the monopile may increase with time after the installation due to the setup effect that takes place along the pile shaft bullock et al 2005 lee et al 2010 and the state of stress of soil prior to the loading sequence will influence the stress path and failure state during the tests kraft jr 1991 the increase of the vertical resistance may be attributed to the factors of dissipation of pore water pressure in saturated conditions thixotropy effects aging effects and multiple unloading reloading sequence of the pile karlsrud 2012 therefore influences of load sequences and histories should be considered in the design phase besides the loading sequence the pile embedment depth has great influence on the bearing capacity the larger contacting area contributes to larger shaft frictions moreover the soil will plug more at larger embedment depths klos and tejchman 1981 paikowsky and whitman 1990 the short open ended pile has lower bearing capacity compared to the close ended pile however as the embedment depth increases the bearing capacity of open ended pile tends to approach that of the close ended pile due to the increment of soil plug capacity estimations of the relationship between the ultimate bearing capacity and the pile embedment depth is necessary in service conditions external loadings are always cyclic in nature wang et al 2018b an axial cyclic loading acting on the pipe pile may be caused by crossing vehicles in costal facilities by wind or wave for offshore structures and by changing water levels in bridge foundation applications wichtmann 2005 under cyclic loadings the stress state of soil will change significantly and result in large residual deformations the cyclic shearing of the surrounding soil tends to cause larger differential accumulated settlements due to the spatial fluctuation of the state variables the bridge or wind turbine foundations are sensitive to these differential settlements and hence the investigation of the cyclic bearing behaviors of the large diameter monopile is essential a series of laboratory tests and field tests were performed to examine the pile cyclic bearing behavior han et al 2016 poulos and chua 1985 and it was pointed out that the cycle loading to cause failure and the accumulated pile axial deformation were essential factors in consideration of the cyclic performance of the monopile the current design methods are largely empirical and heavily rely on calibrations with load tests of piles with relatively small diameters meanwhile tinvestigations of the cyclic behaviors of the pipe pile are not common therefore more high quality tests are required by considering influence factors to extend understandings in the behaviors of large diameter monopile under vertical loadings in this study a series of centrifuge tests is performed to provide important information to offshore geotechnical design the purpose of this study is to 1 investigate the ultimate axial bearing capacity of the monopile 2 clarify the influence of pile dimensions 3 examine the effects of loading rate and loading sequence to the static behaviors 4 demonstrate the behaviors of the monopile under axial cyclic loadings 2 current design methods the total axial ultimate bearing capacity of the pipe pile qt is the summation of shaft capacity qs and base capacity qb 1 q t q s q b π d τ z d z π d 2 4 q b where τz is the local unit shaft friction qb is the ultimate unit base resistance d is the pile diameter z is the embedment depth several design methods have been put forward based on the empirical data from pile tests 2 1 api method american petroleum institute api issues the practice for fixed offshore platforms rp2a wsd 2011 giving the design method in predicting the pile axial bearing capacity det norske veritas dnv recommends the practice for offshore wind turbines construction 2008 which adopts the similar method with api in assessing the pile bearing capacity it is assumed in the practice that the inner unit shaft friction of a pipe pile equals to the outer unit shaft friction the soil characteristics are the major influence factor in this design method the local unit shaft friction is calculated from 2 τ f k f σ v 0 tan δ where kf is the coefficient of lateral earth pressure which is assumed to be 0 8 for open ended piles in unplug mode and 1 for close ended piles or plugged open ended piles σ v0 is the vertical effective stress δ is the friction angle at the pile soil interface the unit tip resistance is given as 3 q b n q σ v 0 q l where σ v0 is the vertical effective stress at the pile tip level nq is the dimensionless bearing factor ql is the limiting tip resistance these values are suggested in practice 2 2 fhwa method the federal highway administration fhwa proposes a relatively conservative method paikowsky and whitman 1990 the calculation procedure is similar to the api method and the smaller result is due to the assumption that the inner friction of the pipe pile is 1 3 to 1 2 of the outer shaft friction the plug mode is considered in this method 4 p l u g g e d q t π d τ z o d z a t q t u n p l u g g e d q t π d τ z o d z π d τ z i d z a a n n q t where τzi is the inner unit shaft friction τzo is the outer unit shaft friction qt is the unit tip resistance at aann are tip and annular areas of the pipe pile respectively 2 3 chinese method finnra method the chinese method construction 2008 is the most widely used pile design method in china the finnra method finnra 2000 is proposed by finnish national road administration these two methods adopt the similar assumption that the capacity of soil plug is simplifies as a reduced value of total tip resistance and the reduction factor is controlled by penetration diameter ratios the calculation is easy to implement with these methods but the plug effects may not be replicated well the two sets of equations are expressed uniformly below 5 q t π d τ z d z η a t q t where η is the plugging coefficient in the chinese method η 1 for close ended piles for open ended piles η 0 16z d when z d 5 and η 0 8 when z d 5 in the finnra method η 0 8 for sandy soil if z d 15 and the value decreases linearly with the z d ratio 2 4 cpt based methods several design methods have been put forward by relating the pile base capacity with the cone penetration resistance schneider et al 2008 including icp method jardine et al 2005 ngi method clausen et al 2005 uwa method lehane et al 2005b and hku method yu and yang 2011 all these cpt based methods consider the soil plug effects in the capacity assessment the estimations of the shaft resistance are similar and the main difference is the calculation of base capacity the icp ngi and uwa methods give an overall estimation of the base capacity using empirical correlation with the cone resistance and the hku method provides a more explicit assessment by differentiating the contribution of the annular and soil plug separately the design equations are listed as follows 6 i c p c l o s e e n d e d q b q c a 0 28 0

relative density ifr is the incremental filling ratio plr is the plug length ratio 3 centrifuge test all pile tests are performed at the geotechnical centrifuge at case western reserve university figueroa et al 1998 the centrifuge modelling is an effective experimental method in studying the geotechnical problems allowing the replication of a more accurate linearly increasing effective stress profile with depth of soil this feature leads to more reliable pile tests the soil profile is significant factor in assessing the pile shaft resistance and base capacity the data interpretation is realized according to the centrifuge scaling law chandrasekaran 2003 the maximum acceleration is 50 g for all the tests the configurations and test results presented in this paper are in prototype scale 3 1 model configuration three pile models are fabricated and tested in the centrifuge as shown in fig 1 the pile models are made of aluminum and have the identical young s modulus ep of 9155 mpa and surface roughness of 0 68 μm de nicola and randolph 1997 the three pile models share the same external diameter and total length of 1 2 m and 7 m respectively dimensions of the pile models are designed according to a 3 mw wind turbine by scaling down 6 times wang et al 2018b and the prototype model dimension is similar to wind turbines operating at the london array wind farm negro et al 2017 the actual embedment depths are defined according to the test setup besides the open ended monopile a closed ended monopile is fabricated for comparison two wall thicknesses are included for the open ended pile as 0 0635 m and 0 127 m the tested piles are rigid piles meyerhof and sastry 1985 prasad and chari 1999 the width of the rigid container located in the centrifuge is 12 05 m which is 10 times of the pile external diameter and hence the boundary effect is minimized wang et al 2017b 3 2 soil properties the fine grained silica sand is used in the centrifuge tests a set of laboratory tests is conducted to quantify the mechanical properties of soil key parameters are summarized in table 1 the silica sand has a relatively small particle size which is beneficial for the centrifuge test with minimum scale effects scaling down the particle size leads to more accurate results for estimating the bearing capacity especially the tip resistance although the particle size is small the silica sand is capable to maintain a high friction angle the direct shear test is conducted to determine the internal friction angle of 33 4 the interface friction angle between the sand and aluminum is 22 from the direct shear test 3 3 test setup the centrifuge tests are load controlled an electrical actuator is fixed vertically above the rigid container in the centrifuge and a load cell is fixed at the tip of the actuator an lvdt is connected with the load cell by a horizontal board the pile connects with the actuator by an adaptor after inputting the load from the control terminal the lvdt moves down together with the load cell to record the pile vertical displacement the test package is depicted in fig 2 the soil profile is prepared by air pluviation method the silica sand is poured into the container with a constant height and additional compaction is applied to get the desired relative density of 70 which is classified as dense sand the final height of soil is 7 m for all the tests for simplicity the dry sand is used for the centrifuge tests the loading rates for the static test and cyclic tests are low enough to avoid the build up of excess pore water pressures and hence the dry condition is conveniently to be used initially wang et al 2017a the vertical effective stress is replicated by the centrifuge scaling law li et al 2010 the piles are installed by jacking and the jacking installation shows a larger tendency to plug than the driving installation due to the less disturbance of soil according to the statistic of 30 operating offshore wind farm that supported by monopile foundation negro et al 2017 the relationship between the pile diameter d and its driven depth ld is fitted as 10 l d 8 d 5 meanwhile considering the boundary effect and limitations of the experimental setup three initial penetration depths namely 2 5 m 3 5 m and 4 5 m are considered for each pile model to study the influence of embedment depth to the pile bearing capacity 3 4 test procedure for each pile model the static load test is firstly conducted to evaluate the ultimate bearing capacity a stepwise loading sequence is applied by the actuator pressing the pile to failure after which the unloading sequence follows each load increment or decrement is in a continuous fashion and is applied following completions of the previous load interval according to the pile test standard of astm astm d 2013 the load for each interval should keep constant for not less than 4 min and not more than 15 min in order to record the corresponded stabilized displacement and to allow the dissipation of excess pore water pressures therefore each load step is kept for 4 min for static tests in the centrifuge to exam the reliability of this time interval two static load tests with longer and shorter time intervals of 8 min and 2 min are conducted to investigate the influence of loading history to the pile capacity the step load is applied again after initial compression tests the centrifuge keeps spinning for 12 5 h to allow the soil to be consolidated before applying the second loading sequence after the second compression test the pile is pulled back to its original position the centrifuge is on for another 12 5 h after which the third compression loading sequence is applied to evaluate influences of tension history to the pile bearing capacity following this the open ended pile with smaller thickness is reinstalled and the loading sequence of cyclic compression tension is applied namely the c t c t test chan and hanna 1980 the applied compression and tension load amplitudes are determined according to the static test results the purpose of this set of test is to investigate behaviors of the pile under tension loadings and relationships between the shaft resistance in compression and tension phases the cyclic load tests are conducted following the static tests and the initial embedment depth for the pile models is kept at 3 5 m the cyclic load varies according to an average load amplitude of 50 of the ultimate bearing capacity determined from the static tests which represents a safety factor of 2 this amount of the initial loading corresponds to the weight of pile supported upper structures the cyclic load develops in a sin wave form with the magnitudes ranging from 5 to 25 of the pile ultimate bearing capacity and continues for 50 cycles followed by a linear unloading period the loading frequency is 0 1 hz so that the inertia forces are not negligible and it is considered as a quasi static cyclic loading wichtmann 2005 the pile models are reinstalled after each cyclic loading sequence the test details are summarized in table 2 associated with descriptions the test identification system includes 1 end condition o open ended c close ended 2 wall thickness t 0 0635 m 2t 0 127 m 3 embedment depth s shallow m middle d deep 4 test condition s static test ct c t c t test c cyclic test 5 loading rate s slow f fast for example o t m s s represents the static test for open ended pile with the wall thickness of 0 0635 m jacking in 3 5 m depth with a slower loading rate 4 experimental results and analysis 4 1 plug development fig 3 demonstrates the progression of soil core height during 1 g installations the recorded core heights and the pile embedment depths are normalized with the inner pile diameter and plotted together in the figure the dashed line indicates the fully coring mode that the soil plug length is equals to the pile penetration depth the pile with larger inner diameter smaller thickness develops a longer soil core which has lower tendency to plug the phenomenon agrees with the previous researches that the small diameter pile has a greater tendency of forming the soil plug yu and yang 2011 4 2 static test 4 2 1 loading rate three static tests with different loading rates are conducted for the open ended pile with small thickness and an initial embedment depth of 3 5 m the loading rate has great influences to the pile responses under axial loadings randolph et al 1992 and the astm standard requires an time interval of 4 15 min for each loading step therefore three time intervals of 2 min 4 min and 8min are tested and the load displacement curves are depicted in fig 4 for the fastest loading rate of 2 min time interval the recorded bearing capacity appears to be much larger than the other two tests in this situation the load keeps for a short time at each step which is not enough for the settlement to stabilize for the longer time intervals of 4 min and 8 min the results are similar when the test time for each load step exceeds 4min the settlement reaches the plateau therefore the time interval of 4 min is used in the rest of the tests 4 2 2 ultimate bearing capacity of three piles the ultimate bearing capacity of the three piles are compared first and a uniform embedment depth of 3 5 m is selected fig 5 shows the relationship between the axial load applied at the pile head and the pile settlement the data points represent the readings of loads and settlements at the stabilized period during each step the load settlement curves are almost linear at the beginning and the three piles demonstrate similar behaviors as the axial load increases slopes of the curves decrease significantly during the axial loading the pile is not likely to plunge into the soil therefore several failure criteria are proposed to determine the ultimate bearing capacity of the pile in this study the ultimate condition is determined when the pile settlement reaches 10 of the pile diameter and the corresponded axial load is the ultimate bearing capacity of the pile model this method has been widely used in previous researches basu and salgado 2014 salgado et al 2011 schneider et al 2008 the 10 d failure line is plotted in fig 5 and the ultimate bearing capacity of the piles are summarized in table 3 the bearing capacity of the close ended pile is larger which is about 1 1 times of the open ended piles the close ended pile is a full displacement pile while the open ended piles are low displacement piles in a partially plug mode kraft jr 1991 under the axial loading the open ended pile moves downwards relative to the surrounding soil initially the external load is mainly supported by the shaft resistance and it is then gradually transferred to the pile base the base resistance is firstly contributed by the annular section after which soil core is compressed by the reaction force the compression increases as the load increases and the soil core tends to move upwards so that the inner shaft friction starts to provide resistances namely the plug resistance the open ended pile reaches the ultimate bearing capacity when the inner shaft friction reaches plateau the open ended pile with larger thickness shows a larger bearing capacity due to its greater tendency of plugging but the difference is not significant 4 2 3 influence of embedment depth the pile bearing capacity is consist of the shaft friction and the base capacity for piles with the same diameter the embedment depth has a great influence to the ultimate bearing capacity meanwhile for the open ended pile the base capacity is the summation of annular resistance and plug resistance and the pile with larger penetration length is more likely to plug yu and yang 2011 therefore each pile is tested with three embedment depths to clarify these effects and the load settlement curves are presented in fig 6 it is obvious that the pile bearing capacity increases with embedment depths for all three models but the increment ratio decreases as the pile penetrates more for instance the bearing capacity of the open ended pile with smaller thickness enhances 36 from 2 5 m to 3 5 m embedment depths but the increment ratio drops to 14 from 3 5 m to 4 5 m the influence of embedment depth to the bearing capacity of the close ended pile is slightly less significant from penetration depths of 2 5 m 3 5 m the increment ratio is 20 while the ratio drops to 17 from 3 5 m to 4 5 m these different responses caused by the penetration depth attributes to the behavior of soil plug the close ended pile is the full displacement pile and hence the bearing capacity almost increases linearly with the penetration depth however for the open ended non displacement pile the enhancement of plug resistance becomes milder at larger depths so that the overall bearing capacity increases in a gradually decreasing rate the ultimate bearing capacities are listed in table 3 to demonstrate the influence of embedment depth more clearly and to give design suggestions the equivalent unit bearing capacity at the pile tip qt qt a is normalized with the overburden pressure qv γz and the results are plotted against the penetration depth as shown in fig 7 the normalized bearing capacity decreases linearly with the penetration depth for all three piles which represents that the influence of the pile depth weakens as the pile penetrates more under the same embedment depth the close ended pile shows larger normalized bearing capacity as expected especially at shallow depths where the soil plug effect is not significant for open ended piles differences of normalized bearing capacity between the two types of piles turn to be less obvious as the embedment depth increases finally the open ended piles are likely to be fully plugged and behave as close ended piles 4 2 4 influence of loading sequence to evaluate influences of the loading sequence to the bearing capacity of different piles the 2nd static tests are conducted after a stabilization period of 12 5 h in one spin before stopping the centrifuge afterwards the static load is applied thirdly after pulling the pile back to the original position the results of the three sets of static tests for three piles embedded in different soil depths are plotted together in fig 8 it is obviously shown that the bearing capacities for all piles increase for the 2nd loading sequence the values of bearing capacity are summarized in table 3 and the increment ratios between the 1st and 2nd test are calculated the stress state of soil prior to the axial loading greatly influences the stress path during the static test and the failure state is influenced by these stresses before the first static test the soil is assumed to be in the virgin state the vertical effective stress next to the pile equals to the effective overburden stress and the shear stress at the pile soil interface is neglected typically in this study the pile is jacking installation which has less disturbance to the soil after the first static loading the soil is compressed more in which the vertical effective stress increases significantly the lateral earth pressure coefficient k is expected to increase moreover the pile tends to move upwards after the first loading sequence due to the rebound of soil under the pile tip and the elastic recovery of pile this movement is resisted by the shaft friction which leads to the lock of compressive residual stress in the pile the residual stress enhances the pile bearing capacity fellenius et al 2004 seo et al 2009 refer to the increment ratio listed in table 3 piles installed in shallow embedment depths tend to enhance less than those installed in larger depths the overburden stress is smaller in the shallow soil layer and the change of soil stress state is not as significant as deeper layers meanwhile the close ended pile shows a larger increment ratio than the open ended piles the low displacement piles lead to less disturbances of soil during the first loading sequence and contribute to smaller changes of stress than the full displacement piles the 1st and 3rd static tests have the same initial embedment depth the final displacement in the tests are similar with the same load magnitude however the stiffness of the load settlement curves reduce significantly at small load levels large settlements are recorded for all the piles especially for the first loading step which leads to a reduction of the overall bearing capacity according to the 10 d failure criteria the phenomenon agrees with the previous centrifuge tests nicola and randolph 1999 the reduction factors are listed in table 3 for all the tests the 3rd loading sequence is applied after pulling back the pile in which condition the pile is in the tension mode before the compression test the shaft friction experiences a reduction when the direction of loading is reversed due to the particle rearrangement and the weakened normal effective stress that acts on the pile shaft moreover the soil under the pile tip tends to fill back during the tension stage but the effective stress of these soil is weaker than the initial test large settlements occur during the initial stage of the 3rd compression test as the loading continues the underlying soil regains its strength and stiffness so that the settlement accumulates in a milder rate the reduction ratio is higher for the shallow embedded piles due to the smaller effective overburden pressures the open ended pile tends to reduce more than the close ended pile since the soil plug need regain its resistance after the tension stage in practice the large diameter pile is possible to load in tension especially for offshore piles attentions should be paid for the short time settlements after tension loads 4 3 c t c t test to investigate the tension capacity of the open ended pile the cyclic c t c t test is conducted for the thinner wall pile with the initial embedment depth of 3 5 m each test includes two compression loops and two tension loops and emphasis are put on the difference of compressive and tensile shaft frictions during the compression phase the pile bearing capacity is the summation of base resistances and shaft frictions under the tensile loading the resistance is mainly provided by the inner and outer shaft frictions it is expected that the tension capacity is much smaller than the compression capacity de nicola and randolph 1997 therefore in the c t c t test the maximum compression load is kept constant at 75 of the ultimate bearing capacity qt 2630 kn while the maximum tension load has three values of 5 10 and 15 of qt the load displacement curves are presented in fig 9 in which the positive load represents compression and the displacement is the deformation referring to the initial penetration depth for the first compression stage the pile is loaded vertically in sin wave till 75 of its ultimate bearing capacity the load settlement curve for this stage is similar to the static test described above for the smallest amplitude tension test fig 9a the tensile displacement is small which is not enough to pull the pile back to the original position it is clearly shown that the settlement develops at a larger rate at the second compression stage and this phenomenon agrees with the static test in the second c t c t test the maximum tension load increases to 10 qt as shown in fig 9b the pile is pulled upwards and exceed the initial penetration depth at the tension stage a much smaller load can result to a larger displacement that exceeds the first compression stage which proves that the pile tensile capacity is much smaller than its compressive capacity the total displacement does not reach the 10 d failure criteria so that a larger tensile load level is applied at the 15 qt test fig 9c a much larger displacement is recorded and the pile moves upwards than its original embedment depth after the second compression stage the tension capacity is 365 kn for the open ended pipe pile meanwhile the bearing capacity for the second tension stage is smaller than the first one the phenomenon is caused by the degradation of shaft frictions and it is a typical situation after compressive loadings the tension test reveals the tensile shaft resistance of the pile which is helpful for predicting the compressive shaft friction 4 4 cyclic test the vertical loadings applied on the pile is always in cyclic nature in the service conditions therefore cyclic responses of the piles are illustrated in this section the three piles are initially embedded 3 5 m in the soil and 5 sin form cyclic tests with peak amplitudes varying from 5 qt to 25 qt are conducted for each pile the piles are firstly compressed with 50 qt magnitude with a safety factor of 2 after which the cyclic load continues for 50 cycles the recorded displacements are plotted against cycle numbers in fig 10 and the induced cyclic loading is depicted in the figure at the initial linear stage the pile is compressed to 50 of their ultimate bearing capacities a uniform accumulation rate is recorded for each pile at this initial linear stage which demonstrates a good repeatability of the centrifuge tests at cyclic loading stages the small intensity cyclic load leads to a smaller accumulated settlement as expected and the total displacement increases continuously with the increase of the load level moreover it is shown that the accumulation rate of the settlement tends to increase with the load amplitude at the 25 qt cyclic load level the pile settles faster with the same total loading cycle than the small amplitude cyclic tests especially for the open ended piles which demonstrates failures of the piles if the 10 d failure criteria is used here all the piles are regarded as failure during the cyclic loading with a total peak amplitude of 75 qt consequently the cyclic load capacity is smaller than the static load capacity and the maximum load amplitudes the pile can sustained in the cyclic condition should below 75 of the pile ultimate bearing capacity the cyclic loading sequence is associated with the degradation of soil strength due to the continuous disturbance to the soil and hence the shaft friction and the base resistance acting on the pile tend to decrease wichtmann 2005 by comparing the cyclic behaviors of the three piles the open ended pile with smaller thickness reaches failure point at the 40th cycle while the pile with larger thickness reaches failure at the 36th cycle for the close ended pile the pile fails at the 50th cycle the phenomenon agrees with the static test results the close ended pile has larger bearing capacity compared to the open ended piles no matter in static or cyclic loading conditions fig 11 shows the accumulation rate of the displacement recorded in the cyclic tests in order to demonstrate the effect of cyclic load amplitudes the displacement accumulation rate is defined by the total settlement increment divided by the total cycle number linear regressions are plotted in the figure the accumulation rate is almost increase linearly with the load intensity the figure is helpful for predicting the total settlement of piles in the service conditions 5 analysis of pile bearing capacity 5 1 api method the bearing capacity of the large diameter pile is the summation of base resistances and shaft frictions and the design methods are described above the api method is widely used for designing the offshore structures without the information of cpt test the api method is used here to theoretically analyze the bearing capacity of tested piles the calculated result is listed in table 4 and relative errors referring to the centrifuge tests are presented at smaller embedment depths the calculated bearing capacities tend to be smaller than the test while this tendency weakens with the increase of initial penetration depths finally the calculation results turn to be larger compared to the test consequently the api method is capable in predicting the bearing capacity of the piles with acceptable relative errors to compare the test results and the api calculated results more clearly the bearing capacities obtained from this two methods are plotted together in fig 12 for the open ended piles the bearing capacity increases with the initial embedment depth but in a decreasing gradient due to the milder soil plug effect but the api calculated bearing capacity increases linearly with the embedment depth for the close ended pile the bearing capacities from the tests and the api method are in linear relationships with the depth but the test result increase at a slower gradient therefore the api method is conservative at smaller depths but tends to overestimate the bearing capacity at larger depth and this consequence agrees well with the conclusions drawn by previous researchers lehane et al 2005a attentions should be paid when using this method when the z d ratio exceeds 3 and a selection of conservative design parameter and or safety factor is required 5 2 shaft friction and base resistance analysis due to the fact the proportion of pile shaft friction qs and base capacity qb cannot be measured by direct means during the compression test the tension tests are performed to predict the qs and hence the qb this is accomplished by factoring the tensile shaft resistance measured from the tension test it has been recognized that the compressive shaft capacity is higher than the tensile shaft capacity due to the change in mean effective stress levels therefore the bearing capacity for tension is factored by a consistent amount of tensile to compressive shaft resistance ratio referring to the previous studies it was suggested that the reduction factor laid in a range of 0 55 0 85 de nicola and randolph 1993 in the tension test the total tensile capacity is 365 kn for the open ended pipe pile with the embedment depth of 3 5 m thus the unit tensile shaft resistance is 14 6 kpa normalized with the unit compressive shaft resistances calculated from the api method which are 17 5 kpa for open ended pile and 21 9 kpa for the close ended pile the reduction factors are suggested as 0 83 and 0 67 respectively the difference between tensile and compressive shaft resistance of open ended pile is smaller due to the soil plug effect both of the inner and external frictions contribute for the tension capacity for the open ended pile while the close ended pile only has the external shaft friction during tensions this method has the limitation that the shaft friction may degrade gradually during the test leading to the change of reduction factors the factor tends to be smaller as the increase of pile penetration depths 6 conclusions a series of centrifuge tests has been performed in this study to investigate the bearing capacity of axially loaded monopiles in sand and both open ended and close ended piles are tested the static load tests are conducted first to determine ultimate bearing capacities of the piles and effects of the influence factors including the loading rate the embedment depth and the loading history are considered the c t c t tests are conducted afterwards to assess the tensile capacity of the piles finally the monopiles are loaded cyclically in order to predict their behaviors in service conditions the theoretical method is used to calibrate with the test results the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 the bearing capacity of the close ended pile is around 1 1 times of the open ended piles with the embedment depth of 3 5 m and the open ended pile with the larger thickness tends to has larger bearing capacity than the smaller thickness pile but the difference is not significant 2 the monopile bearing capacity increases with the initial penetration depth for the full displacement close ended pile the capacity increase almost linearly with the depth for the open ended pile the increment tends to stabilize at larger embedment depths at larger depths the open ended pile behaves like the close ended pile due to the plug effect 3 the stress state of soil prior to the axial loading greatly influences the pile bearing capacity at the second sequence of compression tests the monopiles present larger bearing capacity due to the larger lateral coefficient and the compressive residual stress locked in the pile the close ended pile experiences a larger enhancement than the open ended piles the third compression load is applied after the tension stage the initial stiffness of the load settlement curves drops significantly while a similar final displacement is reached compared to the first compression test the shaft friction and the strength of soil underlying the pile tip degrade due to the tensile loading 4 without the base resistance the tension capacity of the monopile is much smaller than the compression capacity and the tensile shaft friction tends to be lower than the compressive shaft friction 5 the cyclic capacity of the monopile is smaller than its static capacity the maximum cyclic loading that can be sustained by the pile is suggested to be 75 of the ultimate bearing capacity obtained from the static load test 6 the api design method is capable for predicting the bearing capacity of the monopile the method tends to underestimate the bearing capacity at smaller embedment depths and overestimate the capacity at larger depths the conservative design parameter is required when z d ratio exceeds 3 acknowledgment the information data or work presented herein was funded in part by the office of energy

23102,the monopile has been widely used to support offshore and coastal structures a series of centrifuge tests has been performed to investigate the bearing capacity of large diameter monopiles in sandy soil both static tests and cyclic tests have been conducted for open ended and close ended model piles and the effects of influence factors such as loading rates embedment depths and loading histories are considered the piles are then loaded by a sequence of compressive tensile loadings to estimate the tension capacity from which the shaft friction is derived the cyclic load tests are performed with five varying load intensities and the accumulated settlement is assessed the centrifuge tests indicate that the pile bearing capacity tends to increase with the initial penetration depth and the stress state of soil greatly influences the pile behavior the tensile shaft friction is smaller compared to the compression test the capacities of the piles reduce significantly under the axial cyclic load and the maximum cyclic load intensity should be limited to 75 of the ultimate bearing capacity the api design method is used to calibrate with the centrifuge test results the method overestimates the bearing capacity at larger depths and a conservative reduction factor is required keywords axial capacity centrifuge modelling cyclic behavior monopile sand offshore structure 1 introduction the use of large diameter monopiles as deep foundations for offshore structures and coastal facilities continues to be widespread due to the increased exploitation of ocean energy resources the offshore monopiles are typically hollow steel pipe piles with larger diameters negro et al 2017 in china more than 5000 pipe piles are used in the construction of hangzhou bay bridge yu and yang 2011 and the monopile supported intertidal wind turbine contributes for 56 69 of the installed wind capacity in europe the monopile foundation is the most widely used offshore wind foundation with a market share of 87 by the end of 2017 wang et al 2018a the monopiles are driven into the ground and provide considerable bearing capacities in service conditions new challenges are brought to the design of monopile foundation considering the requirements of deeper penetration depths and complex offshore soil conditions understanding the response of large diameter monopiles under axial loadings is essential for proposing proper design methods and ensuring safety in the service conditions the bearing mechanism of the monopile foundation is a complex problem involving large amount of uncertainties during the installation soil enters the pipe pile from the pile tip to form a soil plug and the behaviors of the soil plug significantly affect the pile bearing capacity the early design methods for predicting the bearing capacity of pipe pile were derived from the close ended piles in recent years more efforts have been put on the investigation of bearing behavior of monopiles and mechanisms of the soil plug de nicola and randolph 1997 lehane and gavin 2001 paik and salgado 2003 paik et al 2003 after driving if a pile is in the fully coring mode with the incremental filling ratio ifr equals to 1 soil enters the pile at the same rate to the same or higher level as the ground surface kikuchi et al 2007 if a pile is in the fully plug mode with the ifr equals to 0 the soil plug resists additional soil entering the pile and the pile behaves similarly as a close ended pile in the fully plug mode the plug capacity is estimated to be 68 of the base capacity of a close ended pile and the difference is attributed by the compressibility of the soil plug yu and yang 2011 in practice the ifr is between the two limiting values referring to partially plug mode the small diameter pipe pile and the larger embedment depth are assumed to facilitate the formation of soil plug paik et al 2003 therefore these factors have major impacts on the overall vertical bearing capacity of a large diameter pipe pile and they are necessary to be considered in the analysis of design methods researchers have put considerable efforts in investigating the bearing behaviors of the axially loaded monopiles han et al 2016 performed fully instrumented field test on a close ended pipe pile driven in a multilayered soil profile and both static and dynamic load tests were conducted the tests results were calibrated with several design methods lehane et al 1993 documented a set of field tests in examining the shaft friction of a pipe pile it was found that the position and initial state of soil had significant influence on the stress developed and the pile loading induced changes of radial effective stress the design recommendation was given to estimate the shaft resistance besides the field tests a series of large scale laboratory tests were performed to study the pile bearing capacity the base resistance of pipe piles are investigated by an instrumented model test conducted in a large testing chamber lehane and gavin 2001 the test assessed relative contributions of plug resistance and annular resistance to the overall base resistance for a pipe pile the base resistance had a direct relationship to the cone tip resistance and the ifr in addition centrifuge tests were performed to enrich the database de nicola and randolph 1997 nicola and randolph 1999 it was observed in the tests that the shaft friction degraded in tension tests compared to the compression tests the close ended pile experienced a larger degradation and the base resistance was correlated with the cone resistance recently the influence of soil plug in the dynamic responses of monopiles are investigated and an analytical model is proposed to predict the dynamic velocity response liu et al 2018 a series of field tests were performed in stratified soils to investigate the axial resistance of monopiles and the methods in predicting shaft frictions were put forward by correlating with the standard penetration test kou et al 2016 in previous research most of the tests were performed within short periods of time after installation but there is limited amount of open literature describing the monopile bearing capacity in a relatively longer term zakeri et al 2014 the bearing capacity of the monopile may increase with time after the installation due to the setup effect that takes place along the pile shaft bullock et al 2005 lee et al 2010 and the state of stress of soil prior to the loading sequence will influence the stress path and failure state during the tests kraft jr 1991 the increase of the vertical resistance may be attributed to the factors of dissipation of pore water pressure in saturated conditions thixotropy effects aging effects and multiple unloading reloading sequence of the pile karlsrud 2012 therefore influences of load sequences and histories should be considered in the design phase besides the loading sequence the pile embedment depth has great influence on the bearing capacity the larger contacting area contributes to larger shaft frictions moreover the soil will plug more at larger embedment depths klos and tejchman 1981 paikowsky and whitman 1990 the short open ended pile has lower bearing capacity compared to the close ended pile however as the embedment depth increases the bearing capacity of open ended pile tends to approach that of the close ended pile due to the increment of soil plug capacity estimations of the relationship between the ultimate bearing capacity and the pile embedment depth is necessary in service conditions external loadings are always cyclic in nature wang et al 2018b an axial cyclic loading acting on the pipe pile may be caused by crossing vehicles in costal facilities by wind or wave for offshore structures and by changing water levels in bridge foundation applications wichtmann 2005 under cyclic loadings the stress state of soil will change significantly and result in large residual deformations the cyclic shearing of the surrounding soil tends to cause larger differential accumulated settlements due to the spatial fluctuation of the state variables the bridge or wind turbine foundations are sensitive to these differential settlements and hence the investigation of the cyclic bearing behaviors of the large diameter monopile is essential a series of laboratory tests and field tests were performed to examine the pile cyclic bearing behavior han et al 2016 poulos and chua 1985 and it was pointed out that the cycle loading to cause failure and the accumulated pile axial deformation were essential factors in consideration of the cyclic performance of the monopile the current design methods are largely empirical and heavily rely on calibrations with load tests of piles with relatively small diameters meanwhile tinvestigations of the cyclic behaviors of the pipe pile are not common therefore more high quality tests are required by considering influence factors to extend understandings in the behaviors of large diameter monopile under vertical loadings in this study a series of centrifuge tests is performed to provide important information to offshore geotechnical design the purpose of this study is to 1 investigate the ultimate axial bearing capacity of the monopile 2 clarify the influence of pile dimensions 3 examine the effects of loading rate and loading sequence to the static behaviors 4 demonstrate the behaviors of the monopile under axial cyclic loadings 2 current design methods the total axial ultimate bearing capacity of the pipe pile qt is the summation of shaft capacity qs and base capacity qb 1 q t q s q b π d τ z d z π d 2 4 q b where τz is the local unit shaft friction qb is the ultimate unit base resistance d is the pile diameter z is the embedment depth several design methods have been put forward based on the empirical data from pile tests 2 1 api method american petroleum institute api issues the practice for fixed offshore platforms rp2a wsd 2011 giving the design method in predicting the pile axial bearing capacity det norske veritas dnv recommends the practice for offshore wind turbines construction 2008 which adopts the similar method with api in assessing the pile bearing capacity it is assumed in the practice that the inner unit shaft friction of a pipe pile equals to the outer unit shaft friction the soil characteristics are the major influence factor in this design method the local unit shaft friction is calculated from 2 τ f k f σ v 0 tan δ where kf is the coefficient of lateral earth pressure which is assumed to be 0 8 for open ended piles in unplug mode and 1 for close ended piles or plugged open ended piles σ v0 is the vertical effective stress δ is the friction angle at the pile soil interface the unit tip resistance is given as 3 q b n q σ v 0 q l where σ v0 is the vertical effective stress at the pile tip level nq is the dimensionless bearing factor ql is the limiting tip resistance these values are suggested in practice 2 2 fhwa method the federal highway administration fhwa proposes a relatively conservative method paikowsky and whitman 1990 the calculation procedure is similar to the api method and the smaller result is due to the assumption that the inner friction of the pipe pile is 1 3 to 1 2 of the outer shaft friction the plug mode is considered in this method 4 p l u g g e d q t π d τ z o d z a t q t u n p l u g g e d q t π d τ z o d z π d τ z i d z a a n n q t where τzi is the inner unit shaft friction τzo is the outer unit shaft friction qt

method in china the finnra method finnra 2000 is proposed by finnish national road administration these two methods adopt the similar assumption that the capacity of soil plug is simplifies as a reduced value of total tip resistance and the reduction factor is controlled by penetration diameter ratios the calculation is easy to implement with these methods but the plug effects may not be replicated well the two sets of equations are expressed uniformly below 5 q t π d τ z d z η a t q t where η is the plugging coefficient in the chinese method η 1 for close ended piles for open ended piles η 0 16z d when z d 5 and η 0 8 when z d 5 in the finnra method η 0 8 for sandy soil if z d 15 and the value decreases linearly with the z d ratio 2 4 cpt based methods several design methods have been put forward by relating the pile base capacity with the cone penetration resistance schneider et al 2008 including icp method jardine et al 2005 ngi method clausen et al 2005 uwa method lehane et al 2005b and hku method yu and yang 2011 all these cpt based methods consider the soil plug effects in the capacity assessment the estimations of the shaft resistance are similar and the main difference is the calculation of base capacity the icp ngi and uwa methods give an overall estimation of the base capacity using empirical correlation with the cone resistance and the hku method provides a more explicit assessment by differentiating the contribution of the annular and soil plug separately the design equations are listed as follows 6 i c p c l o s e e n d e d q b q c a 0 28 0

figueroa et al 1998 the centrifuge modelling is an effective experimental method in studying the geotechnical problems allowing the replication of a more accurate linearly increasing effective stress profile with depth of soil this feature leads to more reliable pile tests the soil profile is significant factor in assessing the pile shaft resistance and base capacity the data interpretation is realized according to the centrifuge scaling law chandrasekaran 2003 the maximum acceleration is 50 g for all the tests the configurations and test results presented in this paper are in prototype scale 3 1 model configuration three pile models are fabricated and tested in the centrifuge as shown in fig 1 the pile models are made of aluminum and have the identical young s modulus ep of 9155 mpa and surface roughness of 0 68 μm de nicola and randolph 1997 the three pile models share the same external diameter and total length of 1 2 m and 7 m respectively dimensions of the pile models are designed according to a 3 mw wind turbine by scaling down 6 times wang et al 2018b and the prototype model dimension is similar to wind turbines operating at the london array wind farm negro et al 2017 the actual embedment depths are defined according to the test setup besides the open ended monopile a closed ended monopile is fabricated for comparison two wall thicknesses are included for the open ended pile as 0 0635 m and 0 127 m the tested piles are rigid piles meyerhof and sastry 1985 prasad and chari 1999 the width of the rigid container located in the centrifuge is 12 05 m which is 10 times of the pile external diameter and hence the boundary effect is minimized wang et al 2017b 3 2 soil properties the fine grained silica sand is used in the centrifuge tests a set of laboratory tests is conducted to quantify the mechanical properties of soil key parameters are summarized in table 1 the silica sand has a relatively small particle size which is beneficial for the centrifuge test with minimum scale effects scaling down the particle size leads to more accurate results for estimating the bearing capacity especially the tip resistance although the particle size is small the silica sand is capable to maintain a high friction angle the direct shear test is conducted to determine the internal friction angle of 33 4 the interface friction angle between the sand and aluminum is 22 from the direct shear test 3 3 test setup the centrifuge tests are load controlled an electrical actuator is fixed vertically above the rigid container in the centrifuge and a load cell is fixed at the tip of the actuator an lvdt is connected with the load cell by a horizontal board the pile connects with the actuator by an adaptor after inputting the load from the control terminal the lvdt moves down together with the load cell to record the pile vertical displacement the test package is depicted in fig 2 the soil profile is prepared by air pluviation method the silica sand is poured into the container with a constant height and additional compaction is applied to get the desired relative density of 70 which is classified as dense sand the final height of soil is 7 m for all the tests for simplicity the dry sand is used for the centrifuge tests the loading rates for the static test and cyclic tests are low enough to avoid the build up of excess pore water pressures and hence the dry condition is conveniently to be used initially wang et al 2017a the vertical effective stress is replicated by the centrifuge scaling law li et al 2010 the piles are installed by jacking and the jacking installation shows a larger tendency to plug than the driving installation due to the less disturbance of soil according to the statistic of 30 operating offshore wind farm that supported by monopile foundation negro et al 2017 the relationship between the pile diameter d and its driven depth ld is fitted as 10 l d 8 d 5 meanwhile considering the boundary effect and limitations of the experimental setup three initial penetration depths namely 2 5 m 3 5 m and 4 5 m are considered for each pile model to study the influence of embedment depth to the pile bearing capacity 3 4 test procedure for each pile model the static load test is firstly conducted to evaluate the ultimate bearing capacity a stepwise loading sequence is applied by the actuator pressing the pile to failure after which the unloading sequence follows each load increment or decrement is in a continuous fashion and is applied following completions of the previous load interval according to the pile test standard of astm astm d 2013 the load for each interval should keep constant for not less than 4 min and not more than 15 min in order to record the corresponded stabilized displacement and to allow the dissipation of excess pore water pressures therefore each load step is kept for 4 min for static tests in the centrifuge to exam the reliability of this time interval two static load tests with longer and shorter time intervals of 8 min and 2 min are conducted to investigate the influence of loading history to the pile capacity the step load is applied again after initial compression tests the centrifuge keeps spinning for 12 5 h to allow the soil to be consolidated before applying the second loading sequence after the second compression test the pile is pulled back to its original position the centrifuge is on for another 12 5 h after which the third compression loading sequence is applied to evaluate influences of tension history to the pile bearing capacity following this the open ended pile with smaller thickness is reinstalled and the loading sequence of cyclic compression tension is applied namely the c t c t test chan and hanna 1980 the applied compression and tension load amplitudes are determined according to the static test results the purpose of this set of test is to investigate behaviors of the pile under tension loadings and relationships between the shaft resistance in compression and tension phases the cyclic load tests are conducted following the static tests and the initial embedment depth for the pile models is kept at 3 5 m the cyclic load varies according to an average load amplitude of 50 of the ultimate bearing capacity determined from the static tests which represents a safety factor of 2 this amount of the initial loading corresponds to the weight of pile supported upper structures the cyclic load develops in a sin wave form with the magnitudes ranging from 5 to 25 of the pile ultimate bearing capacity and continues for 50 cycles followed by a linear unloading period the loading frequency is 0 1 hz so that the inertia forces are not negligible and it is considered as a quasi static cyclic loading wichtmann 2005 the pile models are reinstalled after each cyclic loading sequence the test details are summarized in table 2 associated with descriptions the test identification system includes 1 end condition o open ended c close ended 2 wall thickness t 0 0635 m 2t 0 127 m 3 embedment depth s shallow m middle d deep 4 test condition s static test ct c t c t test c cyclic test 5 loading rate s slow f fast for example o t m s s represents the static test for open ended pile with the wall thickness of 0 0635 m jacking in 3 5 m depth with a slower loading rate 4 experimental results and analysis 4 1 plug development fig 3 demonstrates the progression of soil core height during 1 g installations the recorded core heights and the pile embedment depths are normalized with the inner pile diameter and plotted together in the figure the dashed line indicates the fully coring mode that the soil plug length is equals to the pile penetration depth the pile with larger inner diameter smaller thickness develops a longer soil core which has lower tendency to plug the phenomenon agrees with the previous researches that the small diameter pile has a greater tendency of forming the soil plug yu and yang 2011 4 2 static test 4 2 1 loading rate three static tests with different loading rates are conducted for the open ended pile with small thickness and an initial embedment depth of 3 5 m the loading rate has great influences to the pile responses under axial loadings randolph et al 1992 and the astm standard requires an time interval of 4 15 min for each loading step therefore three time intervals of 2 min 4 min and 8min are tested and the load displacement curves are depicted in fig 4 for the fastest loading rate of 2 min time interval the recorded bearing capacity appears to be much larger than the other two tests in this situation the load keeps for a short time at each step which is not enough for the settlement to stabilize for the longer time intervals of 4 min and 8 min the results are similar when the test time for each load step exceeds 4min the settlement reaches the plateau therefore the time interval of 4 min is used in the rest of the tests 4 2 2 ultimate bearing capacity of three piles the ultimate bearing capacity of the three piles are compared first and a uniform embedment depth of 3 5 m is selected fig 5 shows the relationship between the axial load applied at the pile head and the pile settlement the data points represent the readings of loads and settlements at the stabilized period during each step the load settlement curves are almost linear at the beginning and the three piles demonstrate similar behaviors as the axial load increases slopes of the curves decrease significantly during the axial loading the pile is not likely to plunge into the soil therefore several failure criteria are proposed to determine the ultimate bearing capacity of the pile in this study the ultimate condition is determined when the pile settlement reaches 10 of the pile diameter and the corresponded axial load is the ultimate bearing capacity of the pile model this method has been widely used in previous researches basu and salgado 2014 salgado et al 2011 schneider et al 2008 the 10 d failure line is plotted in fig 5 and the ultimate bearing capacity of the piles are summarized in table 3 the bearing capacity of the close ended pile is larger which is about 1 1 times of the open ended piles the close ended pile is a full displacement pile while the open ended piles are low displacement piles in a partially plug mode kraft jr 1991 under the axial loading the open ended pile moves downwards relative to the surrounding soil initially the external load is mainly supported by the shaft resistance and it is then gradually transferred to the pile base the base resistance is firstly contributed by the annular section after which soil core is compressed by the reaction force the compression increases as the load increases and the soil core tends to move upwards so that the inner shaft friction starts to provide resistances namely the plug resistance the open ended pile reaches the ultimate bearing capacity when the inner shaft friction reaches plateau the open ended pile with larger thickness shows a larger bearing capacity due to its greater tendency of plugging but the difference is not significant 4 2 3 influence of embedment depth the pile bearing capacity is consist of the shaft friction and the base capacity for piles with the same diameter the embedment depth has a great influence to the ultimate bearing capacity meanwhile for the open ended pile the base capacity is the summation of annular resistance and plug resistance and the pile with larger penetration length is more likely to plug yu and yang 2011 therefore each pile is tested with three embedment depths to clarify these effects and the load settlement curves are presented in fig 6 it is obvious that the pile bearing capacity increases with embedment depths for all three models but the increment ratio decreases as the pile penetrates more for instance the bearing capacity of the open ended pile with smaller thickness enhances 36 from 2 5 m to 3 5 m embedment depths but the increment ratio drops to 14 from 3 5 m to 4 5 m the influence of embedment depth to the bearing capacity of the close ended pile is slightly less significant from penetration depths of 2 5 m 3 5 m the increment ratio is 20 while the ratio drops to 17 from 3 5 m to 4 5 m these different responses caused by the penetration depth attributes to the behavior of soil plug the close ended pile is the full displacement pile and hence the bearing capacity almost increases linearly with the penetration depth however for the open ended non displacement pile the enhancement of plug resistance becomes milder at larger depths so that the overall bearing capacity increases in a gradually decreasing rate the ultimate bearing capacities are listed in table 3 to demonstrate the influence of embedment depth more clearly and to give design suggestions the equivalent unit bearing capacity at the pile tip qt qt a is normalized with the overburden pressure qv γz and the results are plotted against the penetration depth as shown in fig 7 the normalized bearing capacity decreases linearly with the penetration depth for all three piles which represents that the influence of the pile depth weakens as the pile penetrates more under the same embedment depth the close ended pile shows larger normalized bearing capacity as expected especially at shallow depths where the soil plug effect is not significant for open ended piles differences of normalized bearing capacity between the two types of piles turn to be less obvious as the embedment depth increases finally the open ended piles are likely to be fully plugged and behave as close ended piles 4 2 4 influence of loading sequence to evaluate influences of the loading sequence to the bearing capacity of different piles the 2nd static tests are conducted after a stabilization period of 12 5 h in one spin before stopping the centrifuge afterwards the static load is applied thirdly after pulling the pile back to the original position the results of the three sets of static tests for three piles embedded in different soil depths are plotted together in fig 8 it is obviously shown that the bearing capacities for all piles increase for the 2nd loading sequence the values of bearing capacity are summarized in table 3 and the increment ratios between the 1st and 2nd test are calculated the stress state of soil prior to the axial loading greatly influences the stress path during the static test and the failure state is influenced by these stresses before the first static test the soil is assumed to be in the virgin state the vertical effective stress next to the pile equals to the effective overburden stress and the shear stress at the pile soil interface is neglected typically in this study the pile is jacking installation which has less disturbance to the soil after the first static loading the soil is compressed more in which the vertical effective stress increases significantly the lateral earth pressure coefficient k is expected to increase moreover the pile tends to move upwards after the first loading sequence due to the rebound of soil under the pile tip and the elastic recovery of pile this movement is resisted by the shaft friction which leads to the lock of compressive residual stress in the pile the residual stress enhances the pile bearing capacity fellenius et al 2004 seo et al 2009 refer to the increment ratio listed in table 3 piles installed in shallow embedment depths tend to enhance less than those installed in larger depths the overburden stress is smaller in the shallow soil layer and the change of soil stress state is not as significant as deeper layers meanwhile the close ended pile shows a larger increment ratio than the open ended piles the low displacement piles lead to less disturbances of soil during the first loading sequence and contribute to smaller changes of stress than the full displacement piles the 1st and 3rd static tests have the same initial embedment depth the final displacement in the tests are similar with the same load magnitude however the stiffness of the load settlement curves reduce significantly at small load levels large settlements are recorded for all the piles especially for the first loading step which leads to a reduction of the overall bearing capacity according to the 10 d failure criteria the phenomenon agrees with the previous centrifuge tests nicola and randolph 1999 the reduction factors are listed in table 3 for all the tests the 3rd loading sequence is applied after pulling back the pile in which condition the pile is in the tension mode before the compression test the shaft friction experiences a reduction when the direction of loading is reversed due to the particle rearrangement and the weakened normal effective stress that acts on the pile shaft moreover the soil under the pile tip tends to fill back during the tension stage but the effective stress of these soil is weaker than the initial test large settlements occur during the initial stage of the 3rd compression test as the loading continues the underlying soil regains its strength and stiffness so that the settlement accumulates in a milder rate the reduction ratio is higher for the shallow embedded piles due to the smaller effective overburden pressures the open ended pile tends to reduce more than the close ended pile since the soil plug need regain its resistance after the tension stage in practice the large diameter pile is possible to load in tension especially for offshore piles attentions should be paid for the short time settlements after tension loads 4 3 c t c t test to investigate the tension capacity of the open ended pile the cyclic c t c t test is conducted for the thinner wall pile with the initial embedment depth of 3 5 m each test includes two compression loops and two tension loops and emphasis are put on the difference of compressive and tensile shaft frictions during the compression phase the pile bearing capacity is the summation of base resistances and shaft frictions under the tensile loading the resistance is mainly provided by the inner and outer shaft frictions it is expected that the tension capacity is much smaller than the compression capacity de nicola and randolph 1997 therefore in the c t c t test the maximum compression load is kept constant at 75 of the ultimate bearing capacity qt 2630 kn while the maximum tension load has three values of 5 10 and 15 of qt the load displacement curves are presented in fig 9 in which the positive load represents compression and the displacement is the deformation referring to the initial penetration depth for the first compression stage the pile is loaded vertically in sin wave till 75 of its ultimate bearing capacity the load settlement curve for this stage is similar to the static test described above for the smallest amplitude tension test fig 9a the tensile displacement is small which is not enough to pull the pile back to the original position it is clearly shown that the settlement develops at a larger rate at the second compression stage and this phenomenon agrees with the static test in the second c t c t test the maximum tension load increases to 10 qt as shown in fig 9b the pile is pulled upwards and exceed the initial penetration depth at the tension stage a much smaller load can result to a larger displacement that exceeds the first compression stage which proves that the pile tensile capacity is much smaller than its compressive capacity the total displacement does not reach the 10 d failure criteria so that a larger tensile load level is applied at the 15 qt test fig 9c a much larger displacement is recorded and the pile moves upwards than its original embedment depth after the second compression stage the tension capacity is 365 kn for the open ended pipe pile meanwhile the bearing capacity for the second tension stage is smaller than the first one the phenomenon is caused by the degradation of shaft frictions and it is a typical situation after compressive loadings the tension test reveals the tensile shaft resistance of the pile which is helpful for predicting the compressive shaft friction 4 4 cyclic test the vertical loadings applied on the pile is always in cyclic nature in the service conditions therefore cyclic responses of the piles are illustrated in this section the three piles are initially embedded 3 5 m in the soil and 5 sin form cyclic tests with peak amplitudes varying from 5 qt to 25 qt are conducted for each pile the piles are firstly compressed with 50 qt magnitude with a safety factor of 2 after which the cyclic load continues for 50 cycles the recorded displacements are plotted against cycle numbers in fig 10 and the induced cyclic loading is depicted in the figure at the initial linear stage the pile is compressed to 50 of their ultimate bearing capacities a uniform accumulation rate is recorded for each pile at this initial linear stage which demonstrates a good repeatability of the centrifuge tests at cyclic loading stages the small intensity cyclic load leads to a smaller accumulated settlement as expected and the total displacement increases continuously with the increase of the load level moreover it is shown that the accumulation rate of the settlement tends to increase with the load amplitude at the 25 qt cyclic load level the pile settles faster with the same total loading cycle than the small amplitude cyclic tests especially for the open ended piles which demonstrates failures of the piles if the 10 d failure criteria is used here all the piles are regarded as failure during the cyclic loading with a total peak amplitude of 75 qt consequently the cyclic load capacity is smaller than the static load capacity and the maximum load amplitudes the pile can sustained in the cyclic condition should below 75 of the pile ultimate bearing capacity the cyclic loading sequence is associated with the degradation of soil strength due to the continuous disturbance to the soil and hence the shaft friction and the base resistance acting on the pile tend to decrease wichtmann 2005 by comparing the cyclic behaviors of the three piles the open ended pile with smaller thickness reaches failure point at the 40th cycle while the pile with larger thickness reaches failure at the 36th cycle for the close ended pile the pile fails at the 50th cycle the phenomenon agrees with the static test results the close ended pile has larger bearing capacity compared to the open ended piles no matter in static or cyclic loading conditions fig 11 shows the accumulation rate of the displacement recorded in the cyclic tests in order to demonstrate the effect of cyclic load amplitudes the displacement accumulation rate is defined by the total settlement increment divided by the total cycle number linear regressions are plotted in the figure the accumulation rate is almost increase linearly with the load intensity the figure is helpful for predicting the total settlement of piles in the service conditions 5 analysis of pile bearing capacity 5 1 api method the bearing capacity of the large diameter pile is the summation of base resistances and shaft frictions and the design methods are described above the api method is widely used for designing the offshore structures without the information of cpt test the api method is used here to theoretically analyze the bearing capacity of tested piles the calculated result is listed in table 4 and relative errors referring to the centrifuge tests are presented at smaller embedment depths the calculated bearing capacities tend to be smaller than the test while this tendency weakens with the increase of initial penetration depths finally the calculation results turn to be larger compared to the test consequently the api method is capable in predicting the bearing capacity of the piles with acceptable relative errors to compare the test results and the api calculated results more clearly the bearing capacities obtained from this two methods are plotted together in fig 12 for the open ended piles the bearing capacity increases with the initial embedment depth but in a decreasing gradient due to the milder soil plug effect but the api calculated bearing capacity increases linearly with the embedment depth for the close ended pile the bearing capacities from the tests and the api method are in linear relationships with the depth but the test result increase at a slower gradient therefore the api method is conservative at smaller depths but tends to overestimate the bearing capacity at larger depth and this consequence agrees well with the conclusions drawn by previous researchers lehane et al 2005a attentions should be paid when using this method when the z d ratio exceeds 3 and a selection of conservative design parameter and or safety factor is required 5 2 shaft friction and base resistance analysis due to the fact the proportion of pile shaft friction qs and base capacity qb cannot be measured by direct means during the compression test the tension tests are performed to predict the qs and hence the qb this is accomplished by factoring the tensile shaft resistance measured from the tension test it has been recognized that the compressive shaft capacity is higher than the tensile shaft capacity due to the change in mean effective stress levels therefore the bearing capacity for tension is factored by a consistent amount of tensile to compressive shaft resistance ratio referring to the previous studies it was suggested that the reduction factor laid in a range of 0 55 0 85 de nicola and randolph 1993 in the tension test the total tensile capacity is 365 kn for the open ended pipe pile with the embedment depth of 3 5 m thus the unit tensile shaft resistance is 14 6 kpa normalized with the unit compressive shaft resistances calculated from the api method which are 17 5 kpa for open ended pile and 21 9 kpa for the close ended pile the reduction factors are suggested as 0 83 and 0 67 respectively the difference between tensile and compressive shaft resistance of open ended pile is smaller due to the soil plug effect both of the inner and external frictions contribute for the tension capacity for the open ended pile while the close ended pile only has the external shaft friction during tensions this method has the limitation that the shaft friction may degrade gradually during the test leading to the change of reduction factors the factor tends to be smaller as the increase of pile penetration depths 6 conclusions a series of centrifuge tests has been performed in this study to investigate the bearing capacity of axially loaded monopiles in sand and both open ended and close ended piles are tested the static load tests are conducted first to determine ultimate bearing capacities of the piles and effects of the influence factors including the loading rate the embedment depth and the loading history are considered the c t c t tests are conducted afterwards to assess the tensile capacity of the piles finally the monopiles are loaded cyclically in order to predict their behaviors in service conditions the theoretical method is used to calibrate with the test results the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 the bearing capacity of the close ended pile is around 1 1 times of the open ended piles with the embedment depth of 3 5 m and the open ended pile with the larger thickness tends to has larger bearing capacity than the smaller thickness pile but the difference is not significant 2 the monopile bearing capacity increases with the initial penetration depth for the full displacement close ended pile the capacity increase almost linearly with the depth for the open ended pile the increment tends to stabilize at larger embedment depths at larger depths the open ended pile behaves like the close ended pile due to the plug effect 3 the stress state of soil prior to the axial loading greatly influences the pile bearing capacity at the second sequence of compression tests the monopiles present larger bearing capacity due to the larger lateral coefficient and the compressive residual stress locked in the pile the close ended pile experiences a larger enhancement than the open ended piles the third compression load is applied after the tension stage the initial stiffness of the load settlement curves drops significantly while a similar final displacement is reached compared to the first compression test the shaft friction and the strength of soil underlying the pile tip degrade due to the tensile loading 4 without the base resistance the tension capacity of the monopile is much smaller than the compression capacity and the tensile shaft friction tends to be lower than the compressive shaft friction 5 the cyclic capacity of the monopile is smaller than its static capacity the maximum cyclic loading that can be sustained by the pile is suggested to be 75 of the ultimate bearing capacity obtained from the static load test 6 the api design method is capable for predicting the bearing capacity of the monopile the method tends to underestimate the bearing capacity at smaller embedment depths and overestimate the capacity at larger depths the conservative design parameter is required when z d ratio exceeds 3 acknowledgment the information data or work presented herein was funded in part by the office of energy

23103,this paper focuses on performance analysis of a model scale vessel equipped with an open versus a ducted propeller in self propulsion using a control volume analysis of energy applied on computational fluid dynamics cfd results an energy balance analysis decompose the delivered power for each system into internal and turbulent kinetic energy fluxes i e viscous losses transverse kinetic energy losses and pressure work and axial kinetic energy fluxes such a decomposition can facilitate understanding of system performance and pinpoint enhancement possibilities for this specific case it is shown that the much higher required power for the ducted propeller configuration to the largest extent is due to higher viscous losses caused by mainly propeller duct and different rudder configuration the energy balance analysis is a post processing tool with the only additional requirement of solving the energy equation which can be employed with any cfd code based on commonly available variables keywords hull propulsion system interaction rans energy balance hydrodynamic losses ducted propeller 1 introduction the interaction effects between hull and propulsion system are most commonly described using a well established terminology including thrust deduction wake fraction propulsive efficiency etc however this decomposition has its primary origin in the experimental procedures used to establish ship scale performance rather than from principles of hydrodynamics this can imply limitations in design and optimization of hull and propulsion system as the interaction thus may not be correctly represented we believe that the reliability and capacity of modern computational fluid dynamics cfd has reached a high level of maturity which can be used to extract detailed data of the flow around vessels and propulsion units in a previous paper andersson et al 2018 an alternative approach to study the interaction effects between hull and propulsion system based on control volume analysis of energy was outlined and applied on a propeller operating in open water this method implies that the hydrodynamic losses associated with a high and or uneven acceleration of the flow slipstream rotation and viscous losses can be tracked quantification of the viscous losses is made possible through solving the energy equation for the flow around the vessel a similar method aimed for marine applications have earlier been presented by van terwisga 2013 he suggested an energy balance over a control volume enclosing the entire vessel including propulsion unit however through the assumption of a uniform control volume inflow the evaluation of the fluxes were limited to the control volume downstream boundary the method was not demonstrated in practice more recently schuiling and van terwisga 2016 suggested a methodology for performing an energy analysis based on evaluation of the energy equation over a control volume and applied it on a propeller operating in open water the viscous losses were obtained through volume integrals of the dissipation terms thus the numerical dissipation which cannot be evaluated from cfd has to be obtained indirectly from the difference between delivered power obtained from forces acting on the propeller and the other energy components interaction effects and wake analyses has also been studied within the aircraft and turbo machinery industries using control volume analyses of energy power for instance by denton 1993 drela 2009 and capitao patrao et al 2016 designers developing novel aircraft concepts such as boundary layer ingestion bli are actually dealing with very similar design challenges as ship propulsion system designers with propulsion units operating in the wake of the craft where the counteracting forces of thrust and drag cannot be studied separately eslamdoost et al 2017 applied a control volume analysis of energy on a self propelled axisymmetric body to investigate the effect of propeller diameter variation on the system performance however to the authors knowledge there are no other published studies where similar methodologies have been utilized for analyzing complete marine vessels with propulsion system the objective of this paper is to apply a methodology based on control volume analysis of energy for analyzing the ship propulsion interaction effects the method will be exemplified on a model scale 120 m single screw cargo vessel to study the performance of an open and a ducted propeller in self propulsion the study is limited to one operating point close to the design speed of the vessel 2 energy balance method the methodology is based on evaluation of the energy equation over a control volume surrounding the propulsion system with the flow field obtained through cfd control volume analyses i e application of reynolds transport theorem is a well known tool within fluid mechanics the specific application to marine propulsion units is described in andersson et al 2018 and schuiling and van terwisga 2016 traditionally the delivered power p d is obtained from the propeller torque i e forces on the propeller surface and its rotation rate however by applying the energy balance method over a control volume enclosing the propulsion unit p d can also be obtained by integrating the energy fluxes and pressure work over the surfaces forming the control volume c s 1 p d c s p ρ 1 2 v x 2 1 2 v t 2 v r 2 u ˆ k v n d a w v v i r t u a l where v denotes the velocity vector ρ density and n the normal vector to the control volume surface positive outwards axial tangential and radial velocity components are denoted by x t and r respectively the energy flux is decomposed into kinetic energy in axial direction kinetic energy in transverse directions internal energy u ˆ and turbulent kinetic energy k the axial direction is defined as the vessel sailing direction i e not necessary identical to the propeller axis there is also a contribution from pressure work p on the virtual i e non material control volume surfaces w v v i r t u a l is the work done by shear stresses on the virtual control volume surfaces which often can be neglected especially if the control volume surface is placed in regions without strong velocity gradients fig 1 illustrates the decomposed energy fluxes over a control volume surrounding the propeller and duct note that this is just a general representation there will be inflow and or outflow over all control volumes surfaces studying for instance the internal energy flux in fig 1 there will be a certain internal energy inflow to the control volume due to viscous dissipation occurring upstream the control volume however the outflow of internal energy will exceed the inflow due to viscous dissipation within the control volume the internal energy flux for this control volume will then constitute the difference between inflow and outflow the sum of all energy fluxes over the control volume surfaces should match the delivered power to the propeller evaluated based on forces on the propeller blades decomposition of the delivered power into separate energy fluxes can be an aid for the designer to better understand and improve the performance of a system this approach can also in the future be coupled with automated optimization procedures since it provides quantitative information on the hydrodynamic losses the analysis focuses on the performance within a certain control volume implying that the control volume has to enclose the domain of interest possible options could be to enclose the entire vessel or only the aft ship it is important to note that the control volume extension plays an important role in how one can distinguish and interpret the beneficial energy components from the unfavorable ones for a control volume enclosing the entire vessel including the propulsion unit it is possible to distinguish the unfavorable energy components this is more troublesome for a control volume only including a fraction of the hull below we will elaborate on why however such a control volume can still be beneficial due to other reasons as will be discussed in section 4 firstly we discuss a control volume enclosing the entire vessel in the ideal case the propeller s slipstream would completely fill the wake behind the hull such that no axial kinetic energy flux is left behind the vessel we also assume there will be no transverse kinetic energy flux over the control volume for an ideal vessel and the viscous losses would be reduced to a minimum i e zero potential flow under these conditions it also holds that the rate of pressure work over the control volume would be zero so for an ideal vessel the sum of energy fluxes over the control volume would be zero which implies zero delivered power to keep a constant speed forward this idealization is naturally not practically possible but it shows that for a control volume enclosing the entire vessel all energy fluxes can be considered as unfavorable energy components i e losses on the other hand if the control volume only encloses a certain domain of the vessel such as the aft ship there needs to be an excess of useful energy flux over the control volume to be able to propel the remaining part of the hull at a constant speed this implies that a fraction of the rate of pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux terms must be useful in andersson et al 2018 the rate of pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux terms were decomposed into thrust power useful and axial non uniformity loss these axial non uniformity losses are irreversible losses of pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux they correspond to the total dissipation of pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux to internal energy that will occur downstream the control volume due to mixing out of spatial wake non uniformity i e the equalizing of pressure and velocity gradients to a homogeneous flow state for a propeller operating in undisturbed inflow the useful thrust power can be separated from the axial non uniformity losses using either an ideal control volume or indirectly based on the forces on the propeller surface multiplied with the advance velocity for an integrated system such as a vessel with propulsion system the decomposition into thrust power and axial non uniformity losses is not possible due to unknown advance velocity the control volume analyses conducted in this study does not enclose a free surface it is however possible to also include a free surface in the control volume compared to a double body model the vessel resistance will be higher for the control volume analyses it will imply more kinetic energy losses and viscous losses in the vicinity of the surface this might be important if the propulsion system interacts with the free surface in the following sections the energy flux terms shown in eq 1 and their interpretation are presented in detail 2 1 pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux pressure work and axial kinetic energy fluxes originate from propulsor flow acceleration as well as flow deceleration around the hull as mentioned above both these terms should be viewed as losses for a control volume enclosing the complete vessel and for a control volume only enclosing a part of the vessel they constitute both useful thrust power and axial non uniformity loss considering again the ideal vessel i e one where the propeller s slipstream completely fill the wake behind the hull independent of control volume any deviation from this ideal condition should be viewed as loss in this paper referred to as axial non uniformity loss such a loss is caused by the mis match between the propeller slipstream and hull wake as well as flow non uniformities within the propeller slipstream which also is affected by the rudder this implies that all velocity perturbations downstream the system both positive and negative relative to the vessel speed constitutes deviations from the optimal completely filled wake and indicates the presence of axial non uniformity losses 2 2 transverse kinetic energy flux transverse kinetic energy flux is defined as kinetic energy flux in directions other than the vessel sailing direction transverse kinetic energy is often associated with radial and tangential velocity components induced by the propulsion unit hull curvature or other reasons such as a propeller slipstream not being in line with the sailing direction transverse kinetic energy flux behind the vessel is considered as a loss since the accelerated water in a direction else than the course of the vessel will not contribute to useful thrust in case the transverse kinetic energy outflow of the control volume is reduced in comparison to that of the control volume inflow this term will become negative which may indicate the recovery of the unfavorable transversal components to useful energy components 2 3 internal energy and turbulent kinetic energy flux in a viscous flow kinetic energy of the mean flow is converted to internal energy i e heat through two processes a dissipation of turbulent velocity fluctuations and b direct viscous dissipation from the mean flow to internal energy thus the internal energy flux is a measure of both these processes whereas the turbulent kinetic energy flux only accounts for an intermediate stage in a the turbulent kinetic energy has to be included only due to the cfd modeling where turbulence is modeled using an eddy viscosity model all these energy fluxes should be rated as viscous losses which are highly dependent on boundary layer losses and hence the velocity of the propeller blade relative to surrounding water the size of wetted surfaces and flow separation also the existence of spatial non uniformities in the flow such as circumferential variations associated with the finite number of blades as well as flow structures like hub and tip vortices contribute to increased viscous losses the internal energy is obtained through u ˆ c p t c p specific heat capacity t temperature i e a temperature field is required from cfd implying that the energy equation needs to be solved note that the temperature increase due to dissipation is very small requiring well resolved cfd results to obtain sufficient accuracy before focusing on the analysis of the open and ducted propeller configuration using an energy balance analysis in section 4 the details of the cfd simulations will be outlined in section 3 3 cfd simulation of vessel in model scale a model sized scale factor 1 22 629 single screw 120 m cargo vessel with two alternative propulsion systems an open and a ducted propeller are in focus in this paper these configurations have been studied in a previous research project at ntnu trondheim and self propulsion measurements of the same hull both with open and ducted propeller have therefore previously been carried out at marintek bhattacharyya and steen 2014a b rolls royce as designers of the hull and open propeller has a significant in house knowledge about the open propeller configuration and there may be possibilities for us to obtain full scale performance data on this configuration in the future in general it is not recommended to study interaction effects between hull and propulsions system in model scale because of a different wake field in comparison to the full scale moreover since a tow force is applied to the model scale hull to compensate for the larger frictional resistance relative to full scale the resistance and thrust are not in equilibrium however the main focus of this study is to apply and evaluate the energy balance methodology the full scale cargo vessel has a breadth of 20 8 m a total displacement of 8832 7 m 3 a block coefficient of 0 657 and a nominal draught of 5 5 m the aft ship for the studied configurations with open and ducted propeller are shown in fig 2 unfortunately the detailed propeller geometry for the tested ducted propeller is not available for us due to confidentiality therefore based on available open water characteristics general characteristics of the propeller and the detailed duct geometry we have reconstructed a propeller for this study the propeller characteristics for the open propeller and ducted propeller as reconstructed are provided in table 1 the propellers are also depicted in fig 3 the section shape profiles for both propellers are similar to naca16 the mean lines are close to naca 0 8 the duct profile is a standard 19 a with length equal to 0 54 d p d p propeller diameter the rudder designs are different for the two propulsion units bhattacharyya and steen 2014a b the open propeller is equipped with a rolls royce promas design i e an integrated rudder bulb propeller hubcap system whereas the ducted propeller is not the axial position of both propeller and rudder axis are identical for the two models both systems are studied at froude number 0 203 corresponding to 1 449 m s in model scale or 13 4 knots in full scale to obtain comparable results for the two cases the rotation rate of the propellers have been adjusted in cfd to meet the applied tow force in the model tests cavitation is expected to occur for both configurations but the influence on performance is assumed negligible and is therefore not accounted for within this study for validation of the computations the numerical simulations are carried out with a rotating propeller sliding mesh together with free water surface while the vessel is free to heave and pitch however due to slow convergence of the energy equation and limited computational resources the energy balance analysis is performed on a model with the free surface modeled as a symmetry plane double body model but still with a rotating propeller sinkage trim and propeller rotation rate for the double body model are taken from the corresponding free surface simulations results 3 1 computational domain the size of the computational domain for the free surface simulations given in x y z is 3 5lpp 2 5lpp 2lpp 2lpp 1 5lpp 1lpp 0 0 0 located at mid ship and lpp being the length between perpendiculars for the vessel as stated earlier the free surface is not modeled in the simulations used for the energy balance analysis and instead a horizontal plane at the undisturbed free surface level with symmetry boundary condition is used to determine the computational domains upper boundary a separate domain for the propeller is constructed as shown in fig 2 for the ducted propeller the propeller region circumferential boundary consists of the inner surface of the duct the computational grids are generated using star ccm v10 06 the main domain consists of predominantly hexahedral cut cells created using the trimmer mesher in star ccm on hull and rudder 7 prism layers along the material surfaces are applied for the propeller domain polyhedral cells which are suitable for geometries with highly curved surfaces are employed prism layers are extruded from the polyhedral surface mesh using the advancing layer mesher in star ccm the boundary layers on propellers and duct are resolved using 15 prism layers near the walls with an expansion ratio of 1 3 a grid sensitivity study is not performed in this paper however in order to ensure the mesh quality the grids are constructed based on previous studies andersson et al 2015 and andersson et al 2018 which also discuss the influence of grid refinement on the energy balance analysis wall functions are applied to model the boundary layers on the hull and rudder since the available turbulence models in star ccm v10 06 provide a better resistance prediction with wall models as shown in previous studies andersson et al 2015 although the reynolds stress model rsm predicts a more accurate wake field and resistance with resolved boundary layers it is computationally expensive to use for free surface simulations due to that highly anisotropic cells preferably used at the water surface can result in convergence problems the turbulence model k ω sst with resolved boundary layers results in an under estimated hull resistance which k ω sst using wall functions does not suffer from still the wake field may be less accurately resolved with the latter combination however our investigations shows that the computed bare hull wake field using k ω sst with curvature correction together with wall functions is in a good agreement with the measured wake field for the hull used in this study the propeller and duct boundary layers are resolved by creating prism layers with y 1 and letting the code switch between wall functions and resolving the boundary layer down to the wall based on the local y value volumetric controls and anisotropic mesh refinements are used to refine the region close to the hull the wake and the free surface except the region around the duct identical mesh refinements are used for the case with open and ducted propellers the region with refined grid at the stern is slightly larger for the double body model compared to the free surface model see fig 4 for the resulting mesh structure in the region surrounding the propeller and table 2 for a summary of the number of cells the average y for the hull domain below the water surface is 60 80 3 2 cfd simulation method the commercial cfd package star ccm v10 06 a finite volume method solver is employed star ccm is a general purpose cfd code used for a wide variety of applications it solves the conservation equations for momentum mass energy and turbulence quantities using a segregated solver based on the simple algorithm a second order upwind discretization scheme in space is used as well as a second order implicit scheme for time integration in addition to the standard procedure for self propulsion simulations the energy equation is also solved this enables the measurement of kinetic energy and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation in the form of a temperature rise in the flow first the simulations are performed with free surface and the hull is free to heave and pitch together with a rotating propeller the free surface is modeled using the volume of fluid vof method implying that the domain consists of one fluid which properties vary according to the volume fraction of water air the convective term is discretized using the high resolution interface capturing hric scheme the heave and pitch motions are modeled with the dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi equilibrium model in star ccm the model moves the body stepwise to obtain balanced forces and moments without solving the equations of motions the propeller domain is rotating and sliding mesh interfaces have been applied between the domains an inlet velocity boundary condition of 1 449 m s is specified at the inlet and lateral boundaries on the outlet a hydrostatic pressure is prescribed for the free surface setup and a uniform static pressure for the double body model the water surface level is initialized as the declared draft of the hull turbulence is modeled using k ω sst with curvature correction as discussed in section 3 1 in the beginning to speed up the simulation procedure the cases are run with a larger time step and a fixed propeller utilizing multiple reference frames mrf to simulate propeller rotation with frozen rotor interfaces the hull is released to freely heave and pitch after the forces are stabilized thereafter when sinkage trim and hull resistance again are stabilized the time step is reduced to a value corresponding to 1 propeller rotation per time step when overall results are stabilized after time step reduction the propeller domain is set to rotate using sliding mesh the rotation rate of the propeller is adjusted to meet the applied tow force from model tests this is performed manually since the simulation is very slow in reacting to changes in rotation rate and not much time would have been gained by automation the simulations are run until the initial transients have disappeared typically occurring after 20 100 propeller revolutions thereafter they are run for further five revolutions before data is gathered finally the double body simulations are performed with trim sinkage and propeller rotation rate obtained from the free surface simulation results these simulations are also initialized using mrf and thereafter applying sliding mesh interfaces with a time step corresponding to 1 propeller rotation 3 3 validation cfd results are compared to test data bhattacharyya and steen 2014a b in table 3 the propeller open water efficiencies η 0 t h r u s t v a p d have been obtained through thrust identity using open water performance data from corresponding open water cfd results not described within this article but propeller domain identical to the one used for self propulsion for the ducted propeller k t represents the total thrust from propeller and duct as mentioned earlier the propeller rotation rate has been adjusted to match the tow force used in the towing tank tests this adjustment is an iterative procedure and for computationally expensive simulations it becomes very time consuming to find the exact rotation speed which corresponds to the applied tow force as a result the tow force used in the simulations turned out to be 2 8 and 4 5 lower than the corresponding towing tank values for the open and ducted propeller respectively this also implies that the simulated tow force is 1 8 lower for the ducted propeller compared to the open propeller the comparison with tests as shown in table 3 is not very impressive for any of the configurations for both cases the thrust predicted by cfd is low compared to test data despite that the tow force is lower than test for both cases which theoretically should mean higher loaded propellers this ought to mean that either the thrust deduction or hull resistance is under estimated the cfd predicted bare hull resistance differed only 0 9 compared to commercial model tests conducted using the same model but at another occasion test data being rolls royce ip and therefore not possible to disclose within that test campaign also the bare hull wake field was measured and the agreement between cfd and these measurements is considered relatively good however even if both thrust coefficient k t t h r u s t ρ n 2 d p 4 and torque coefficient k q t o r q u e ρ n 2 d p 5 are inaccurately predicted the open propeller efficiency is actually relatively well predicted by cfd in self propulsion this is unfortunately not the case for the ducted propeller configuration as mentioned earlier a complicating matter is that the ducted propeller geometry in the cfd setup is not identical with the one tested the cfd method used for the ducted propeller in open water has previously been validated with good results and k t p propeller thrust coefficient and k q for the reconstructed propeller were both in good agreement with available open water results 1 however just as in self propulsion the duct thrust was clearly under predicted in open water the duct exhibits a distinct separation behind the leading edge in both operating conditions it is a well known fact that k ω sst has a tendency to over predict separations which may be the case here now with some perspective on the study alternatives to or modifications of the k ω sst turbulence model with curvature correction should have been considered in an earlier phase of the project to better predict the duct separation we should neither neglect that the propeller duct interaction may be poorly captured due to differences in simulated and tested propeller geometry which also may influence the duct thrust cfd also overestimate the ducted propeller torque which may be associated to the deviation in propeller rotation rate from the measured value by 4 which in turn can be a consequence of the tow force mismatch this validation exercise shows that the cfd results especially for the ducted propeller configuration is not fully representative for the tested conditions the energy balance analysis conducted in section 4 could therefore only be claimed to be valid for the computed setups further since accurate cfd results are crucial for the outcome of an energy balance analysis more effort needs to be spent on obtaining accurate cfd methods representative for model as well as full scale conditions due to that the detailed test conditions and procedures beside the exact geometry are unfamiliar to the authors for this case there may be a risk that the computed and tested configurations differ more than what we are aware of the test case is thus not optimal for a fair comparison of the two configurations but is still deemed satisfactory to use for demonstrating the principles and application of an energy balance analysis on two different propulsion system configurations to justify the use of a double body model for the energy balance analysis k t k t d and k q are compared to the free surface model results in table 4 the relative differences are negligible in comparison to the correspondence between test data and cfd possible reasons behind the deviations are influences from the free surface not accounted for in the double body model improper convergence of free surface simulations or the grid differences between free surface and double body model setups 4 energy balance analysis of vessel in model scale the energy balance analysis is applied on the vessel with open and ducted propeller first the energy balance over three different control volumes enclosing the propeller the aft ship and the entire vessel are evaluated and discussed in section 4 1 then in section 4 2 for a more detailed evaluation of the performance of each case the aft ship control volume is applied the control volumes are established as a post processing step using derived parts in star ccm the control volume boundaries are all located within the outer domain which has a cut cell grid aligned with a cartesian coordinate system to minimize interpolation errors the shape of the control volumes in this study is therefore a rectangular box aligned with the same coordinate system as the grid since we are dealing with a transient flow the energy fluxes through the control volume should be averaged over a certain time interval to accurately represent conversion of propeller shaft power to different energy components however a simplification has been carried out within this study and the presented results are obtained through averaging of three different propeller positions with the reference blade located at 0 defined as the top position 30 and 60 in this paper all graphic visualization of the results will be taken with the reference blade position at 60 throughout the analyses the work performed by shear stresses on the imaginary control volume surface is not included since it constitutes less than 0 01 of the total energy balance for the applied control volumes note that all energy balances are influenced by the fact that the systems are not in force equilibrium due to the applied tow force for compensation of scale effects this study is limited to analysis of the systems in model scale results which cannot be directly transferred to full scale 4 1 establishment of control volume establishment of a suitable control volume is a critical stage of the system energy balance investigation three different control volumes are here discussed and suggested enclosing the propeller a the aft ship b and the entire vessel c all illustrated in fig 5 the extensions of the control volumes are identical for the open and ducted propeller cases which are within the refined grid regions surrounding the vessel the energy balance for each of these control volumes is specified in tables 5 and 6 for the open and ducted propeller configuration respectively all numbers included in the tables are round off presentation of the computed values therefore the sum may not match the individual components exactly to better illustrate the difference between the control volumes the energy balance analysis for the open propeller is also shown as a bar chart in fig 6 the discrepancy between delivered power evaluated based on forces acting on the propeller and control volume energy balance varies within the range of 0 7 2 9 considering that the propeller is operating in an inhomogeneous wake behind the vessel and the transient flow in the vicinity of the propeller the agreement is reasonable among the studied control volumes the agreement is poorest for the control volume enclosing the aft ship b which may be associated with large flow fluctuations on control volume boundaries in this region not directly linked to propeller load variations moreover the effect of numerical dissipation numerical convergence and inaccuracies of evaluating energy fluxes over the control volume surface could also be contributing to the reported discrepancy the energy balance for control volume a represents the flow field over the propeller the axial kinetic energy flux and pressure work terms are a direct consequence of the propeller thrust generation a pressure difference is produced between the forward and rear surfaces of the blade and the water is accelerated downstream as described in section 2 a fraction of these terms will however be axial non uniformity losses due to for instance the circumferential variations associated with the finite number of blades and tip vortices for a propeller in undisturbed inflow the decomposition into useful thrust power and axial non uniformity losses can be performed indirectly through evaluation of the thrust power based on forces acting on the propeller blades multiplied with the advance velocity this cannot be conducted with similar accuracy for a propeller operating in behind due to undefined advance velocity the transverse kinetic energy flux component mainly represents the deflection of the flow over the propeller blades and hence is positive for both configurations the internal energy and turbulent kinetic energy flux describes the viscous losses over the propulsion unit which to the largest extent is due to boundary layer losses but also can incorporate the mixing out of velocity gradients within the flow such as the tip vortices since control volume a describes the flow in the vicinity of the propeller it is suitable for isolated studies of the propeller hydrodynamics but it cannot capture the interaction effects between the hull propeller and rudder therefore this control volume is less suitable for analyzing the system performance in order to resolve the aforementioned limitations of control volume a control volume b is proposed this control volume encloses a larger extent of the aft ship as well as the propulsor and the rudder the inflow to this control volume constitutes of hull boundary layer the positive pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux terms fig 6 are associated with a net positive thrust power over the material boundaries enclosing the control volume for a vessel at constant speed the net thrust within the control volume should balance the net drag on the remaining part of the hull outside the control volume minus the tow force similar to control volume a the pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux terms also constitutes of an axial non uniformity loss and neither for this control volume is it easily quantified since an advance velocity cannot be defined however through an understanding of the origin of the axial non uniformity loss i e non uniformities in the flow other qualitative methods can be applied concerning the transverse kinetic energy flux control volume b incorporates possible bilge vortices the propeller slipstream rotation as well as rudder performance since it extends sufficiently far upstream and downstream of the aforementioned regions the transverse kinetic energy flux term obtained for control volume b has a minor contribution to the total energy balance for both of the open and ducted propeller configurations this small contribution is caused by a transverse inflow through the lateral boundaries due to propeller suction which is canceled out by the propeller slipstream which to various extent is straightened up over the rudder the internal and turbulent kinetic energy fluxes describes all viscous losses occurring within the control volume an alternative solution to avoid the net positive thrust power of unknown magnitude present for both control volume a and b to facilitate the quantification of the axial non uniformity losses is to apply a larger control volume which encloses the entire vessel with such a large control volume the entire vessel is in focus not only the propulsor or aft ship the negative axial kinetic energy flux is caused by the fact that the vessel slows down the surrounding water more than accelerating it the magnitude of the axial kinetic energy flux term is smaller for the ducted propeller configuration due to larger flow acceleration over the propulsion unit and hence smaller axial kinetic energy flux deficit in the vessel wake the pressure work term is positive which considering the negative axial kinetic energy flux and bernoulli s principle is relatively intuitive to argue the transverse kinetic energy flux is mainly a combination of an inflow to the control volume from its lower side due to propeller suction and an outflow exceeding this downstream the rudder within the propeller slipstream the internal and turbulent kinetic energy fluxes are much larger in comparison to control volume a and b since boundary layer losses for the entire vessel are included the differences between the compared propeller configurations to a large extent originate from the aft ship since the remaining parts are identical as described in section 2 for an ideal self propelled system using a control volume surrounding the entire vessel the energy balance should sum up to zero this implies that the combined axial kinetic energy flux and pressure work term ideally should be zero for the studied cases the aforementioned sum results in negative values 8 29 w and 6 26 w for the open and ducted propeller respectively intuitively these negative values can be interpreted as a higher performance compared to the theoretically optimal one however we should not forget the existence of an external tow force acting on the system the assisting unloading power of the tow force can be expressed by multiplying the tow force with the ship speed 10 46 w however due to axial non uniformity losses the sum of the axial kinetic energy flux and pressure work terms does not sum up to the unloading tow force power the difference between these values represent the axial non uniformity losses seen from the perspective of control volume c which are 2 18 w and 4 20 w for the open and ducted propellers respectively we believe that the most complete picture of the system is obtained through control volume c enclosing the complete vessel using this control volume even weaker effects such as increased boundary layer losses far upstream due to an altered propeller suction are captured and it is possible to quantify the axial non uniformity loss the energy balance is however more difficult to grasp and use for pedagogical explanations especially since the axial kinetic energy flux and pressure work consists of positive and negative contributions from wake and propulsor slipstream that cancel each other control volume a cannot be used to capture the interaction effects between stern propulsor and rudder thus control volume b in this study is considered to be the most practical configuration for analyzing the system performance and will be used for comparison of the open and ducted propeller in section 4 2 4 2 analysis of open and ducted propeller configurations using an energy balance as shown in tables 5 and 6 the total required delivered power is increased by 28 for the ducted propeller configuration compared to the open propeller according to the cfd results the difference in open water efficiencies computed by cfd as listed in table 3 is much less than this observed difference in delivered power note also that the sinkage and trim for the respective configurations are almost the same 7 1 6 8 mm and 0 067 0 071 and thus not expected to contribute significantly to the difference in delivered power using the energy balance analysis we will try to examine the reasons behind the power discrepancy note also that this complete discussion will focus on the flow conditions as computed by cfd which disfavor the ducted propeller configuration in relation to tested cases see section 3 3 but in general a shorter duct is most often favored at operating points similar to the studied one and modern duct profiles with better performance at such speeds are available the energy balance analysis for the open and ducted propeller configurations using the control volume enclosing the aft ship b is illustrated in fig 7 the internal energy flux is 55 higher for the ducted propeller configuration which is an indication of much higher viscous losses the transverse kinetic energy flux is negative for the open propeller configuration and positive for the ducted propeller this implies a gain of transverse kinetic energy flux for the open propeller seen from the perspective of control volume b however the overall contribution to the total energy balance from this term is quite small the combined axial kinetic energy flux and pressure work terms are 13 higher for the ducted propeller configuration the useful thrust power for the ducted propeller configuration is most probably not very much different from the open propeller to propel the remaining part of the hull outside the control volume thus the axial non uniformity loss is most probably higher for the ducted propeller configuration to cover the difference which also was indicated using control volume c in section 4 1 an attempt is made to explain important factors contributing to the system performance through separation of the energy balance over control volume b into three internal control volumes upstream the propeller over the propeller and over the rudder as illustrated in fig 8 this data is provided in tables 7 and 8 since internal energy is a measure of dissipation of kinetic energy into heat the turbulent kinetic energy which is an intermediate stage in this process is not included within this analysis further since the transverse kinetic energy component is minor for both cases and relatively straightforward to analyze less attention is paid to this component in the discussion below a constant vessel speed is assured when the useful thrust matches the resistance of the entire vessel with a working propulsion unit the analysis is complex since thrust and resistance are tightly coupled i e an increased resistance implies a higher thrust a higher thrust is associated with higher velocities through the propulsion unit and thus increased viscous losses as well as an impaired pressure recovery on the hull upstream the propeller and increased forces on the rudder i e an even higher resistance tables 7 and 8 show that more pressure work axial kinetic energy is generated over the ducted propeller 5 5 23 8 w compared to 12 3 10 7 w over the open propeller i e a larger acceleration of the flow over the propulsor the thrust coefficients as listed in table 3 also correspond to a higher thrust for the ducted propeller case 20 3 n compared to 17 8 n furthermore it can be observed that the dissipation of kinetic energy to internal energy is higher for the ducted propeller configuration both over the propeller 38 and over the rudder 143 while the differences over the upstream part are much smaller this increased internal energy flux is caused by a set of reasons such as increased boundary layers losses due to higher induced velocities and larger wetted surfaces and mixing out of spatial wake non uniformities the minor increase over the upstream part is the easiest one to understand it can only be caused by increased boundary layers losses due to higher induced velocities by the propulsion unit since the geometry within this control volume is identical for both configurations the internal energy flux through the interface between the propeller and rudder control volumes are depicted in fig 9 for the ducted propeller configuration it is clear that the duct contributes to a large share of the increased viscous losses amplified levels of internal energy flux are noticed on both outer and inner side of the duct the semi circular form of high internal energy flux surrounding the duct originates from the flow separation behind the duct leading edge on the inner side the viscous losses to a large extent steam from the propeller tip vortex duct interaction for both configurations higher internal energy fluxes are observed in the right hand side blade wakes which are a consequence of more heavily loaded blades in the wake peak to reduce the internal energy flux i e the viscous losses for the ducted propeller a shorter duct would of course be beneficial implying less boundary layer losses also a propeller duct interaction implying less viscous losses as well as a duct with less tendency to separation for both cases a less pronounced wake peak would reduce the viscous losses a large difference in performance is observed over the rudder the energy balance in tables 7 and 8 shows that the overall energy conversion process is from pressure work and transverse kinetic energy to axial kinetic energy and internal energy for both configurations however for the open propeller 6 5 w is converted to axial kinetic energy while the figure for the ducted propeller configuration is only 0 9 w with a much larger share of conversion to internal energy flux 143 i e energy disappearing into viscous losses the internal energy flux behind the rudder is depicted in fig 10 for the open propeller it is clear that the internal energy fluxes at this instance deduce from the blade boundary layer losses and mixing out of tip vortices as well as from the rudder boundary layer losses the levels are higher on the right hand side of the rudder which is due to the higher losses originating from the propeller slipstream at this location but also enhanced by the rudder boundary layer losses which are larger on the rudder suction side i e the upper right and lower left sides of the rudder the internal energy flux for the ducted propeller at this plane is more irregular and can be traced back to several flow features firstly from the propulsion unit we have both the duct and propeller losses in addition to that the different rudder design seems to contribute significantly to the higher internal energy flux for the ducted propeller case the hub vortex hits the rudder leading edge due to the lack of a rudder bulb and hub cap the rudder profile is also thicker 25 and less streamlined moreover the rudder for the ducted propeller configuration has oval shaped horizontal plates on the upper and lower edges from which the internal energy flux traces are clearly visible in fig 10 since the propeller slipstream accelerates to higher velocities for the ducted propeller configuration higher boundary layer losses are expected to be able to quantify the additional losses associated with the different rudder designs it could have been of interest to study them separately in otherwise identical configurations in general to improve the systems through enhancing the rudder hydrodynamic performance the viscous loss associated with the rudder is one important parameter which is easily visualized through the internal energy flux however the viscous losses must be studied together with the other energy fluxes as well as maneuvering capacity since a reduction in the viscous losses may imply an increase in any of the other energy components to get further insight in the usefulness of the axial kinetic energy flux pressure work term these terms can also be visualized in general large velocity or pressure perturbations relative to the vessel speed imply strong gradients in the flow field that eventually will mix out downstream and dissipate in the form of internal energy in other words to minimize the axial non uniformity losses as homogeneous flow field as possible is preferable figs 11 and 12 show the axial kinetic energy flux through sections located between the propeller and the rudder as well as downstream the rudder respectively a less uniform wake is noted for the ducted propeller configuration at both instances which implies higher axial non uniformity losses since these flow fields will need to equalize downstream this also means that the spatially non uniform ducted propeller slip stream depicted in fig 11 most probably contribute to the large conversion to internal energy over the rudder region as noted above the level of axial flow non uniformity can possibly be evaluated through analyzing the conversion to internal energy flux over a control volume downstream the rudder however difficulties arise when the region with reasonably refined grid behind the vessel is too short so the rate of conversion to internal energy has the same order of magnitude as the accuracy of the energy balance method in an unsteady flow as observed in this study some possible use of the energy balance analysis for design improvements have been brought up above however on a more general level from the energy balance perspective there are three overall strategies to improve the system reducing transverse flows behind the vessel obtaining a more uniform flow field in the axial direction and reducing viscous losses an improvement in one aspect often implies an increment in other losses for instance a reduction in transverse kinetic losses often costs in form of increased viscous losses to be able to predict the interplay between the various loss components in advance experience of the use of energy balance analyses is preferable to facilitate learning between projects a standardized methodology for both cfd setup and post processing is highly recommended since the distribution into the various energy flux components is depends not only on control volume extension but also computational grid 5 conclusions we have shown that a control volume analysis of energy applied on cfd results provide an alternative approach for studying the required delivered power of a vessel the energy balance analysis is not a method replacing the traditional propulsive factors for ship scale performance predictions but however a promising tool for describing understanding and improving flow physics and associated system performance independent of system configuration it is a post processing tool with the only additional requirement of solving the energy equation which can be employed in any cfd code based on commonly available variables the energy balance analysis provide a very good illustration of the viscous losses through internal and turbulent kinetic energy fluxes as well as transverse kinetic energy losses the axial non uniformity losses are mostly illustrated visually in this paper however similar to the other loss components the quantification of the axial non uniformity losses is of a great interest and will be studied in the future associated with this is also studies on the most suitable control volume for these kind of analyses for a range of configurations additionally further understanding of the required power can be achieved by studying the flow field and energy balance through out a full blade revolution cycle the method is fully dependent on cfd results to describe the flow around the vessel and propulsion unit accurately therefore further method validation has to be carried out for different types of vessels and propulsor configurations at various operating conditions in both model and full scale acknowledgements this research is supported by the

kinetic energy losses and pressure work and axial kinetic energy fluxes such a decomposition can facilitate understanding of system performance and pinpoint enhancement possibilities for this specific case it is shown that the much higher required power for the ducted propeller configuration to the largest extent is due to higher viscous losses caused by mainly propeller duct and different rudder configuration the energy balance analysis is a post processing tool with the only additional requirement of solving the energy equation which can be employed with any cfd code based on commonly

most commonly described using a well established terminology including thrust deduction wake fraction propulsive efficiency etc however this decomposition has its primary origin in the experimental procedures used to establish ship scale performance rather than from principles of hydrodynamics this can imply limitations in design and optimization of hull and propulsion system as the interaction thus may not be correctly represented we believe that the reliability and capacity of modern computational fluid dynamics cfd has reached a high level of maturity which can be used to extract detailed data of the flow around vessels and propulsion units in a previous paper andersson et al 2018 an alternative approach to study the interaction effects between hull and propulsion system based on control volume analysis of energy was outlined and applied on a propeller operating in open water this method implies that the hydrodynamic losses associated with a high and or uneven acceleration of the flow slipstream rotation and viscous losses can be tracked quantification of the viscous losses is made possible through solving the energy equation for the flow around the vessel a similar method aimed for marine applications have earlier been presented by van terwisga 2013 he suggested an energy balance over a control volume enclosing the entire vessel including propulsion unit however through the assumption of a uniform control volume inflow the evaluation of the fluxes were limited to the control volume downstream boundary the method was not demonstrated in practice more recently schuiling and van terwisga 2016 suggested a methodology for performing an energy analysis based on evaluation of the energy equation over a control volume and applied it on a propeller operating in open water the viscous losses were obtained through volume integrals of the dissipation terms thus the numerical dissipation which cannot be evaluated from cfd has to be obtained indirectly from the difference between delivered power obtained from forces acting on the propeller and the other energy components interaction effects and wake analyses has also been studied within the aircraft and turbo machinery industries using control volume analyses of energy power for instance by denton 1993 drela 2009 and capitao patrao et al 2016 designers developing novel aircraft concepts such as boundary layer ingestion bli are actually dealing with very similar design challenges as ship propulsion system designers with propulsion units operating in the wake of the craft where the counteracting forces of thrust and drag cannot be studied separately eslamdoost et al 2017 applied a control volume analysis of energy on a self propelled axisymmetric body to investigate the effect of propeller diameter variation on the system performance however to the authors knowledge there are no other published studies where similar methodologies have been utilized for analyzing complete marine vessels with propulsion system the objective of this paper is to apply a methodology based on control volume analysis of energy for analyzing the ship propulsion interaction effects the method will be exemplified on a model scale 120 m single screw cargo vessel to study the performance of an open and a ducted propeller in self propulsion the study is limited to one operating point close to the design speed of the vessel 2 energy balance method the methodology is based on evaluation of the energy equation over a control volume surrounding the propulsion system with the flow field obtained through cfd control volume analyses i e application of reynolds transport theorem is a well known tool within fluid mechanics the specific application to marine propulsion units is described in andersson et al 2018 and schuiling and van terwisga 2016 traditionally the delivered power p d is obtained from the propeller torque i e forces on the propeller surface and its rotation rate however by applying the energy balance method over a control volume enclosing the propulsion unit p d can also be obtained by integrating the energy fluxes and pressure work over the surfaces forming the control volume c s 1 p d c s p ρ 1 2 v x 2 1 2 v t 2 v r 2 u ˆ k v n d a w v v i r t u a l where v denotes the velocity vector ρ density and n the normal vector to the control volume surface positive outwards axial tangential and radial velocity components are denoted by x t and r respectively the energy flux is decomposed into kinetic energy in axial direction kinetic energy in transverse directions internal energy u ˆ and turbulent kinetic energy k the axial direction is defined as the vessel sailing direction i e not necessary identical to the propeller axis there is also a contribution from pressure work p on the virtual i e non material control volume surfaces w v v i r t u a l is the work done by shear stresses on the virtual control volume surfaces which often can be neglected especially if the control volume surface is placed in regions without strong velocity gradients fig 1 illustrates the decomposed energy fluxes over a control volume surrounding the propeller and duct note that this is just a general representation there will be inflow and or outflow over all control volumes surfaces studying for instance the internal energy flux in fig 1 there will be a certain internal energy inflow to the control volume due to viscous dissipation occurring upstream the control volume however the outflow of internal energy will exceed the inflow due to viscous dissipation within the control volume the internal energy flux for this control volume will then constitute the difference between inflow and outflow the sum of all energy fluxes over the control volume surfaces should match the delivered power to the propeller evaluated based on forces on the propeller blades decomposition of the delivered power into separate energy fluxes can be an aid for the designer to better understand and improve the performance of a system this approach can also in the future be coupled with automated optimization procedures since it provides quantitative information on the hydrodynamic losses the analysis focuses on the performance within a certain control volume implying that the control volume has to enclose the domain of interest possible options could be to enclose the entire vessel or only the aft ship it is important to note that the control volume extension plays an important role in how one can distinguish and interpret the beneficial energy components from the unfavorable ones for a control volume enclosing the entire vessel including the propulsion unit it is possible to distinguish the unfavorable energy components this is more troublesome for a control volume only including a fraction of the hull below we will elaborate on why however such a control volume can still be beneficial due to other reasons as will be discussed in section 4 firstly we discuss a control volume enclosing the entire vessel in the ideal case the propeller s slipstream would completely fill the wake behind the hull such that no axial kinetic energy flux is left behind the vessel we also assume there will be no transverse kinetic energy flux over the control volume for an ideal vessel and the viscous losses would be reduced to a minimum i e zero potential flow under these conditions it also holds that the rate of pressure work over the control volume would be zero so for an ideal vessel the sum of energy fluxes over the control volume would be zero which implies zero delivered power to keep a constant speed forward this idealization is naturally not practically possible but it shows that for a control volume enclosing the entire vessel all energy fluxes can be considered as unfavorable energy components i e losses on the other hand if the control volume only encloses a certain domain of the vessel such as the aft ship there needs to be an excess of useful energy flux over the control volume to be able to propel the remaining part of the hull at a constant speed this implies that a fraction of the rate of pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux terms must be useful in andersson et al 2018 the rate of pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux terms were decomposed into thrust power useful and axial non uniformity loss these axial non uniformity losses are irreversible losses of pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux they correspond to the total dissipation of pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux to internal energy that will occur downstream the control volume due to mixing out of spatial wake non uniformity i e the equalizing of pressure and velocity gradients to a homogeneous flow state for a propeller operating in undisturbed inflow the useful thrust power can be separated from the axial non uniformity losses using either an ideal control volume or indirectly based on the forces on the propeller surface multiplied with the advance velocity for an integrated system such as a vessel with propulsion system the decomposition into thrust power and axial non uniformity losses is not possible due to unknown advance velocity the control volume analyses conducted in this study does not enclose a free surface it is however possible to also include a free surface in the control volume compared to a double body model the vessel resistance will be higher for the control volume analyses it will imply more kinetic energy losses and viscous losses in the vicinity of the surface this might be important if the propulsion system interacts with the free surface in the following sections the energy flux terms shown in eq 1 and their interpretation are presented in detail 2 1 pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux pressure work and axial kinetic energy fluxes originate from propulsor flow acceleration as well as flow deceleration around the hull as mentioned above both these terms should be viewed as losses for a control volume enclosing the complete vessel and for a control volume only enclosing a part of the vessel they constitute both useful thrust power and axial non uniformity loss considering again the ideal vessel i e one where the propeller s slipstream completely fill the wake behind the hull independent of control volume any deviation from this ideal condition should be viewed as loss in this paper referred to as axial non uniformity loss such a loss is caused by the mis match between the propeller slipstream and hull wake as well as flow non uniformities within the propeller slipstream which also is affected by the rudder this implies that all velocity perturbations downstream the system both positive and negative relative to the vessel speed constitutes deviations from the optimal completely filled wake and indicates the presence of axial non uniformity losses 2 2 transverse kinetic energy flux transverse kinetic energy flux is defined as kinetic energy flux in directions other than the vessel sailing direction transverse kinetic energy is often associated with radial and tangential velocity components induced by the propulsion unit hull curvature or other reasons such as a propeller slipstream not being in line with the sailing direction transverse kinetic energy flux behind the vessel is considered as a loss since the accelerated water in a direction else than the course of the vessel will not contribute to useful thrust in case the transverse kinetic energy outflow of the control volume is reduced in comparison to that of the control volume inflow this term will become negative which may indicate the recovery of the unfavorable transversal components to useful energy components 2 3 internal energy and turbulent kinetic energy flux in a viscous flow kinetic energy of the mean flow is converted to internal energy i e heat through two processes a dissipation of turbulent velocity fluctuations and b direct viscous dissipation from the mean flow to internal energy thus the internal energy flux is a measure of both these processes whereas the turbulent kinetic energy flux only accounts for an intermediate stage in a the turbulent kinetic energy has to be included only due to the cfd modeling where turbulence is modeled using an eddy viscosity model all these energy fluxes should be rated as viscous losses which are highly dependent on boundary layer losses and hence the velocity of the propeller blade relative to surrounding water the size of wetted surfaces and flow separation also the existence of spatial non uniformities in the flow such as circumferential variations associated with the finite number of blades as well as flow structures like hub and tip vortices contribute to increased viscous losses the internal energy is obtained through u ˆ c p t c p specific heat capacity t temperature i e a temperature field is required from cfd implying that the energy equation needs to be solved note that the temperature increase due to dissipation is very small requiring well resolved cfd results to obtain sufficient accuracy before focusing on the analysis of the open and ducted propeller configuration using an energy balance analysis in section 4 the details of the cfd simulations will be outlined in section 3 3 cfd simulation of vessel in model scale a model sized scale factor 1 22 629 single screw 120 m cargo vessel with two alternative propulsion systems an open and a ducted propeller are in focus in this paper these configurations have been studied in a previous research project at ntnu trondheim and self propulsion measurements of the same hull both with open and ducted propeller have therefore previously been carried out at marintek bhattacharyya and steen 2014a b rolls royce as designers of the hull and open propeller has a significant in house knowledge about the open propeller configuration and there may be possibilities for us to obtain full scale performance data on this configuration in the future in general it is not recommended to study interaction effects between hull and propulsions system in model scale because of a different wake field in comparison to the full scale moreover since a tow force is applied to the model scale hull to compensate for the larger frictional resistance relative to full scale the resistance and thrust are not in equilibrium however the main focus of this study is to apply and evaluate the energy balance methodology the full scale cargo vessel has a breadth of 20 8 m a total displacement of 8832 7 m 3 a block coefficient of 0 657 and a nominal draught of 5 5 m the aft ship for the studied configurations with open and ducted propeller are shown in fig 2 unfortunately the detailed propeller geometry for the tested ducted propeller is not available for us due to confidentiality therefore based on available open water characteristics general characteristics of the propeller and the detailed duct geometry we have reconstructed a propeller for this study the propeller characteristics for the open propeller and ducted propeller as reconstructed are provided in table 1 the propellers are also depicted in fig 3 the section shape profiles for both propellers are similar to naca16 the mean lines are close to naca 0 8 the duct profile is a standard 19 a with length equal to 0 54 d p d p propeller diameter the rudder designs are different for the two propulsion units bhattacharyya and steen 2014a b the open propeller is equipped with a rolls royce promas design i e an integrated rudder bulb propeller hubcap system whereas the ducted propeller is not the axial position of both propeller and rudder axis are identical for the two models both systems are studied at froude number 0 203 corresponding to 1 449 m s in model scale or 13 4 knots in full scale to obtain comparable results for the two cases the rotation rate of the propellers have been adjusted in cfd to meet the applied tow force in the model tests cavitation is expected to occur for both configurations but the influence on performance is assumed negligible and is therefore not accounted for within this study for validation of the computations the numerical simulations are carried out with a rotating propeller sliding mesh together with free water surface while the vessel is free to heave and pitch however due to slow convergence of the energy equation and limited computational resources the energy balance analysis is performed on a model with the free surface modeled as a symmetry plane double body model but still with a rotating propeller sinkage trim and propeller rotation rate for the double body model are taken from the corresponding free surface simulations results 3 1 computational domain the size of the computational domain for the free surface simulations given in x y z is 3 5lpp 2 5lpp 2lpp 2lpp 1 5lpp 1lpp 0 0 0 located at mid ship and lpp being the length between perpendiculars for the vessel as stated earlier the free surface is not modeled in the simulations used for the energy balance analysis and instead a horizontal plane at the undisturbed free surface level with symmetry boundary condition is used to determine the computational domains upper boundary a separate domain for the propeller is constructed as shown in fig 2 for the ducted propeller the propeller region circumferential boundary consists of the inner surface of the duct the computational grids are generated using star ccm v10 06 the main domain consists of predominantly hexahedral cut cells created using the trimmer mesher in star ccm on hull and rudder 7 prism layers along the material surfaces are applied for the propeller domain polyhedral cells which are suitable for geometries with highly curved surfaces are employed prism layers are extruded from the polyhedral surface mesh using the advancing layer mesher in star ccm the boundary layers on propellers and duct are resolved using 15 prism layers near the walls with an expansion ratio of 1 3 a grid sensitivity study is not performed in this paper however in order to ensure the mesh quality the grids are constructed based on previous studies andersson et al 2015 and andersson et al 2018 which also discuss the influence of grid refinement on the energy balance analysis wall functions are applied to model the boundary layers on the hull and rudder since the available turbulence models in star ccm v10 06 provide a better resistance prediction with wall models as shown in previous studies andersson et al 2015 although the reynolds stress model rsm predicts a more accurate wake field and resistance with resolved boundary layers it is computationally expensive to use for free surface simulations due to that highly anisotropic cells preferably used at the water surface can result in convergence problems the turbulence model k ω sst with resolved boundary layers results in an under estimated hull resistance which k ω sst using wall functions does not suffer from still the wake field may be less accurately resolved with the latter combination however our investigations shows that the computed bare hull wake field using k ω sst with curvature correction together with wall functions is in a good agreement with the measured wake field for the hull used in this study the propeller and duct boundary layers are resolved by creating prism layers with y 1 and letting the code switch between wall functions and resolving the boundary layer down to the wall based on the local y value volumetric controls and anisotropic mesh refinements are used to refine the region close to the hull the wake and the free surface except the region around the duct identical mesh refinements are used for the case with open and ducted propellers the region with refined grid at the stern is slightly larger for the double body model compared to the free surface model see fig 4 for the resulting mesh structure in the region surrounding the propeller and table 2 for a summary of the number of cells the average y for the hull domain below the water surface is 60 80 3 2 cfd simulation method the commercial cfd package star ccm v10 06 a finite volume method solver is employed star ccm is a general purpose cfd code used for a wide variety of applications it solves the conservation equations for momentum mass energy and turbulence quantities using a segregated solver based on the simple algorithm a second order upwind discretization scheme in space is used as well as a second order implicit scheme for time integration in addition to the standard procedure for self propulsion simulations the energy equation is also solved this enables the measurement of kinetic energy and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation in the form of a temperature rise in the flow first the simulations are performed with free surface and the hull is free to heave and pitch together with a rotating propeller the free surface is modeled using the volume of fluid vof method implying that the domain consists of one fluid which properties vary according to the volume fraction of water air the convective term is discretized using the high resolution interface capturing hric scheme the heave and pitch motions are modeled with the dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi equilibrium model in star ccm the model moves the body stepwise to obtain balanced forces and moments without solving the equations of motions the propeller domain is rotating and sliding mesh interfaces have been applied between the domains an inlet velocity boundary condition of 1 449 m s is specified at the inlet and lateral boundaries on the outlet a hydrostatic pressure is prescribed for the free surface setup and a uniform static pressure for the double body model the water surface level is initialized as the declared draft of the hull turbulence is modeled using k ω sst with curvature correction as discussed in section 3 1 in the beginning to speed up the simulation procedure the cases are run with a larger time step and a fixed propeller utilizing multiple reference frames mrf to simulate propeller rotation with frozen rotor interfaces the hull is released to freely heave and pitch after the forces are stabilized thereafter when sinkage trim and hull resistance again are stabilized the time step is reduced to a value corresponding to 1 propeller rotation per time step when overall results are stabilized after time step reduction the propeller domain is set to rotate using sliding mesh the rotation rate of the propeller is adjusted to meet the applied tow force from model tests this is performed manually since the simulation is very slow in reacting to changes in rotation rate and not much time would have been gained by automation the simulations are run until the initial transients have disappeared typically occurring after 20 100 propeller revolutions thereafter they are run for further five revolutions before data is gathered finally the double body simulations are performed with trim sinkage and propeller rotation rate obtained from the free surface simulation results these simulations are also initialized using mrf and thereafter applying sliding mesh interfaces with a time step corresponding to 1 propeller rotation 3 3 validation cfd results are compared to test data bhattacharyya and steen 2014a b in table 3 the propeller open water efficiencies η 0 t h r u s t v a p d have been obtained through thrust identity using open water performance data from corresponding open water cfd results not described within this article but propeller domain identical to the one used for self propulsion for the ducted propeller k t represents the total thrust from propeller and duct as mentioned earlier the propeller rotation rate has been adjusted to match the tow force used in the towing tank tests this adjustment is an iterative procedure and for computationally expensive simulations it becomes very time consuming to find the exact rotation speed which corresponds to the applied tow force as a result the tow force used in the simulations turned out to be 2 8 and 4 5 lower than the corresponding towing tank values for the open and ducted propeller respectively this also implies that the simulated tow force is 1 8 lower for the ducted propeller compared to the open propeller the comparison with tests as shown in table 3 is not very impressive for any of the configurations for both cases the thrust predicted by cfd is low compared to test data despite that the tow force is lower than test for both cases which theoretically should mean higher loaded propellers this ought to mean that either the thrust deduction or hull resistance is under estimated the cfd predicted bare hull resistance differed only 0 9 compared to commercial model tests conducted using the same model but at another occasion test data being rolls royce ip and therefore not possible to disclose within that test campaign also the bare hull wake field was measured and the agreement between cfd and these measurements is considered relatively good however even if both thrust coefficient k t t h r u s t ρ n 2 d p 4 and torque coefficient k q t o r q u e ρ n 2 d p 5 are inaccurately predicted the open propeller efficiency is actually relatively well predicted by cfd in self propulsion this is unfortunately not the case for the ducted propeller configuration as mentioned earlier a complicating matter is that the ducted propeller geometry in the cfd setup is not identical with the one tested the cfd method used for the ducted propeller in open water has previously been validated with good results and k t p propeller thrust coefficient and k q for the reconstructed propeller were both in good agreement with available open water results 1 however just as in self propulsion the duct thrust was clearly under predicted in open water the duct exhibits a distinct separation behind the leading edge in both operating conditions it is a well known fact that k ω sst has a tendency to over predict separations which may be the case here now with some perspective on the study alternatives to or modifications of the k ω sst turbulence model with curvature correction should have been considered in an earlier phase of the project to better predict the duct separation we should neither neglect that the propeller duct interaction may be poorly captured due to differences in simulated and tested propeller geometry which also may influence the duct thrust cfd also overestimate the ducted propeller torque which may be associated to the deviation in propeller rotation rate from the measured value by 4 which in turn can be a consequence of the tow force mismatch this validation exercise shows that the cfd results especially for the ducted propeller configuration is not fully representative for the tested conditions the energy balance analysis conducted in section 4 could therefore only be claimed to be valid for the computed setups further since accurate cfd results are crucial for the outcome of an energy balance analysis more effort needs to be spent on obtaining accurate cfd methods representative for model as well as full scale conditions due to that the detailed test conditions and procedures beside the exact geometry are unfamiliar to the authors for this case there may be a risk that the computed and tested configurations differ more than what we are aware of the test case is thus not optimal for a fair comparison of the two configurations but is still deemed satisfactory to use for demonstrating the principles and application of an energy balance analysis on two different propulsion system configurations to justify the use of a double body model for the energy balance analysis k t k t d and k q are compared to the free surface model results in table 4 the relative differences are negligible in comparison to the correspondence between test data and cfd possible reasons behind the deviations are influences from the free surface not accounted for in the double body model improper convergence of free surface simulations or the grid differences between free surface and double body model setups 4 energy balance analysis of vessel in model scale the energy balance analysis is applied on the vessel with open and ducted propeller first the energy balance over three different control volumes enclosing the propeller the aft ship and the entire vessel are evaluated and discussed in section 4 1 then in section 4 2 for a more detailed evaluation of the performance of each case the aft ship control volume is applied the control volumes are established as a post processing step using derived parts in star ccm the control volume boundaries are all located within the outer domain which has a cut cell grid aligned with a cartesian coordinate system to minimize interpolation errors the shape of the control volumes in this study is therefore a rectangular box aligned with the same coordinate system as the grid since we are dealing with a transient flow the energy fluxes through the control volume should be averaged over a certain time interval to accurately represent conversion of propeller shaft power to different energy components however a simplification has been carried out within this study and the presented results are obtained through averaging of three different propeller positions with the reference blade located at 0 defined as the top position 30 and 60 in this paper all graphic visualization of the results will be taken with the reference blade position at 60 throughout the analyses the work performed by shear stresses on the imaginary control volume surface is not included since it constitutes less than 0 01 of the total energy balance for the applied control volumes note that all energy balances are influenced by the fact that the systems are not in force equilibrium due to the applied tow force for compensation of scale effects this study is limited to analysis of the systems in model scale results which cannot be directly transferred to full scale 4 1 establishment of control volume establishment of a suitable control volume is a critical stage of the system energy balance investigation three different control volumes are here discussed and suggested enclosing the propeller a the aft ship b and the entire vessel c all illustrated in fig 5 the extensions of the control volumes are identical for the open and ducted propeller cases which are within the refined grid regions surrounding the vessel the energy balance for each of these control volumes is specified in tables 5 and 6 for the open and ducted propeller configuration respectively all numbers included in the tables are round off presentation of the computed values therefore the sum may not match the individual components exactly to better illustrate the difference between the control volumes the energy balance analysis for the open propeller is also shown as a bar chart in fig 6 the discrepancy between delivered power evaluated based on forces acting on the propeller and control volume energy balance varies within the range of 0 7 2 9 considering that the propeller is operating in an inhomogeneous wake behind the vessel and the transient flow in the vicinity of the propeller the agreement is reasonable among the studied control volumes the agreement is poorest for the control volume enclosing the aft ship b which may be associated with large flow fluctuations on control volume boundaries in this region not directly linked to propeller load variations moreover the effect of numerical dissipation numerical convergence and inaccuracies of evaluating energy fluxes over the control volume surface could also be contributing to the reported discrepancy the energy balance for control volume a represents the flow field over the propeller the axial kinetic energy flux and pressure work terms are a direct consequence of the propeller thrust generation a pressure difference is produced between the forward and rear surfaces of the blade and the water is accelerated downstream as described in section 2 a fraction of these terms will however be axial non uniformity losses due to for instance the circumferential variations associated with the finite number of blades and tip vortices for a propeller in undisturbed inflow the decomposition into useful thrust power and axial non uniformity losses can be performed indirectly through evaluation of the thrust power based on forces acting on the propeller blades multiplied with the advance velocity this cannot be conducted with similar accuracy for a propeller operating in behind due to undefined advance velocity the transverse kinetic energy flux component mainly represents the deflection of the flow over the propeller blades and hence is positive for both configurations the internal energy and turbulent kinetic energy flux describes the viscous losses over the propulsion unit which to the largest extent is due to boundary layer losses but also can incorporate the mixing out of velocity gradients within the flow such as the tip vortices since control volume a describes the flow in the vicinity of the propeller it is suitable for isolated studies of the propeller hydrodynamics but it cannot capture the interaction effects between the hull propeller and rudder therefore this control volume is less suitable for analyzing the system performance in order to resolve the aforementioned limitations of control volume a control volume b is proposed this control volume encloses a larger extent of the aft ship as well as the propulsor and the rudder the inflow to this control volume constitutes of hull boundary layer the positive pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux terms fig 6 are associated with a net positive thrust power over the material boundaries enclosing the control volume for a vessel at constant speed the net thrust within the control volume should balance the net drag on the remaining part of the hull outside the control volume minus the tow force similar to control volume a the pressure work and axial kinetic energy flux terms also constitutes of an axial non uniformity loss and neither for this control volume is it easily quantified since an advance velocity cannot be defined however through an understanding of the origin of the axial non uniformity loss i e non uniformities in the flow other qualitative methods can be applied concerning the transverse kinetic energy flux control volume b incorporates possible bilge vortices the propeller slipstream rotation as well as rudder performance since it extends sufficiently far upstream and downstream of the aforementioned regions the transverse kinetic energy flux term obtained for control volume b has a minor contribution to the total energy balance for both of the open and ducted propeller configurations this small contribution is caused by a transverse inflow through the lateral boundaries due to propeller suction which is canceled out by the propeller slipstream which to various extent is straightened up over the rudder the internal and turbulent kinetic energy fluxes describes all viscous losses occurring within the control volume an alternative solution to avoid the net positive thrust power of unknown magnitude present for both control volume a and b to facilitate the quantification of the axial non uniformity losses is to apply a larger control volume which encloses the entire vessel with such a large control volume the entire vessel is in focus not only the propulsor or aft ship the negative axial kinetic energy flux is caused by the fact that the vessel slows down the surrounding water more than accelerating it the magnitude of the axial kinetic energy flux term is smaller for the ducted propeller configuration due to larger flow acceleration over the propulsion unit and hence smaller axial kinetic energy flux deficit in the vessel wake the pressure work term is positive which considering the negative axial kinetic energy flux and bernoulli s principle is relatively intuitive to argue the transverse kinetic energy flux is mainly a combination of an inflow to the control volume from its lower side due to propeller suction and an outflow exceeding this downstream the rudder within the propeller slipstream the internal and turbulent kinetic energy fluxes are much larger in comparison to control volume a and b since boundary layer losses for the entire vessel are included the differences between the compared propeller configurations to a large extent originate from the aft ship since the remaining parts are identical as described in section 2 for an ideal self propelled system using a control volume surrounding the entire vessel the energy balance should sum up to zero this implies that the combined axial kinetic energy flux and pressure work term ideally should be zero for the studied cases the aforementioned sum results in negative values 8 29 w and 6 26 w for the open and ducted propeller respectively intuitively these negative values can be interpreted as a higher performance compared to the theoretically optimal one however we should not forget the existence of an external tow force acting on the system the assisting unloading power of the tow force can be expressed by multiplying the tow force with the ship speed 10 46 w however due to axial non uniformity losses the sum of the axial kinetic energy flux and pressure work terms does not sum up to the unloading tow force power the difference between these values represent the axial non uniformity losses seen from the perspective of control volume c which are 2 18 w and 4 20 w for the open and ducted propellers respectively we believe that the most complete picture of the system is obtained through control volume c enclosing the complete vessel using this control volume even weaker effects such as increased boundary layer losses far upstream due to an altered propeller suction are captured and it is possible to quantify the axial non uniformity loss the energy balance is however more difficult to grasp and use for pedagogical explanations especially since the axial kinetic energy flux and pressure work consists of positive and negative contributions from wake and propulsor slipstream that cancel each other control volume a cannot be used to capture the interaction effects between stern propulsor and rudder thus control volume b in this study is considered to be the most practical configuration for analyzing the system performance and will be used for comparison of the open and ducted propeller in section 4 2 4 2 analysis of open and ducted propeller configurations using an energy balance as shown in tables 5 and 6 the total required delivered power is increased by 28 for the ducted propeller configuration compared to the open propeller according to the cfd results the difference in open water efficiencies computed by cfd as listed in table 3 is much less than this observed difference in delivered power note also that the sinkage and trim for the respective configurations are almost the same 7 1 6 8 mm and 0 067 0 071 and thus not expected to contribute significantly to the difference in delivered power using the energy balance analysis we will try to examine the reasons behind the power discrepancy note also that this complete discussion will focus on the flow conditions as computed by cfd which disfavor the ducted propeller configuration in relation to tested cases see section 3 3 but in general a shorter duct is most often favored at operating points similar to the studied one and modern duct profiles with better performance at such speeds are available the energy balance analysis for the open and ducted propeller configurations using the control volume enclosing the aft ship b is illustrated in fig 7 the internal energy flux is 55 higher for the ducted propeller configuration which is an indication of much higher viscous losses the transverse kinetic energy flux is negative for the open propeller configuration and positive for the ducted propeller this implies a gain of transverse kinetic energy flux for the open propeller seen from the perspective of control volume b however the overall contribution to the total energy balance from this term is quite small the combined axial kinetic energy flux and pressure work terms are 13 higher for the ducted propeller configuration the useful thrust power for the ducted propeller configuration is most probably not very much different from the open propeller to propel the remaining part of the hull outside the control volume thus the axial non uniformity loss is most probably higher for the ducted propeller configuration to cover the difference which also was indicated using control volume c in section 4 1 an attempt is made to explain important factors contributing to the system performance through separation of the energy balance over control volume b into three internal control volumes upstream the propeller over the propeller and over the rudder as illustrated in fig 8 this data is provided in tables 7 and 8 since internal energy is a measure of dissipation of kinetic energy into heat the turbulent kinetic energy which is an intermediate stage in this process is not included within this analysis further since the transverse kinetic energy component is minor for both cases and relatively straightforward to analyze less attention is paid to this component in the discussion below a constant vessel speed is assured when the useful thrust matches the resistance of the entire vessel with a working propulsion unit the analysis is complex since thrust and resistance are tightly coupled i e an increased resistance implies a higher thrust a higher thrust is associated with higher velocities through the propulsion unit and thus increased viscous losses as well as an impaired pressure recovery on the hull upstream the propeller and increased forces on the rudder i e an even higher resistance tables 7 and 8 show that more pressure work axial kinetic energy is generated over the ducted propeller 5 5 23 8 w compared to 12 3 10 7 w over the open propeller i e a larger acceleration of the flow over the propulsor the thrust coefficients as listed in table 3 also correspond to a higher thrust for the ducted propeller case 20 3 n compared to 17 8 n furthermore it can be observed that the dissipation of kinetic energy to internal energy is higher for the ducted propeller configuration both over the propeller 38 and over the rudder 143 while the differences over the upstream part are much smaller this increased internal energy flux is caused by a set of reasons such as increased boundary layers losses due to higher induced velocities and larger wetted surfaces and mixing out of spatial wake non uniformities the minor increase over the upstream part is the easiest one to understand it can only be caused by increased boundary layers losses due to higher induced velocities by the propulsion unit since the geometry within this control volume is identical for both configurations the internal energy flux through the interface between the propeller and rudder control volumes are depicted in fig 9 for the ducted propeller configuration it is clear that the duct contributes to a large share of the increased viscous losses amplified levels of internal energy flux are noticed on both outer and inner side of the duct the semi circular form of high internal energy flux surrounding the duct originates from the flow separation behind the duct leading edge on the inner side the viscous losses to a large extent steam from the propeller tip vortex duct interaction for both configurations higher internal energy fluxes are observed in the right hand side blade wakes which are a consequence of more heavily loaded blades in the wake peak to reduce the internal energy flux i e the viscous losses for the ducted propeller a shorter duct would of course be beneficial implying less boundary layer losses also a propeller duct interaction implying less viscous losses as well as a duct with less tendency to separation for both cases a less pronounced wake peak would reduce the viscous losses a large difference in performance is observed over the rudder the energy balance in tables 7 and 8 shows that the overall energy conversion process is from pressure work and transverse kinetic energy to axial kinetic energy and internal energy for both configurations however for the open propeller 6 5 w is converted to axial kinetic energy while the figure for the ducted propeller configuration is only 0 9 w with a much larger share of conversion to internal energy flux 143 i e energy disappearing into viscous losses the internal energy flux behind the rudder is depicted in fig 10 for the open propeller it is clear that the internal energy fluxes at this instance deduce from the blade boundary layer losses and mixing out of tip vortices as well as from the rudder boundary layer losses the levels are higher on the right hand side of the rudder which is due to the higher losses originating from the propeller slipstream at this location but also enhanced by the rudder boundary layer losses which are larger on the rudder suction side i e the upper right and lower left sides of the rudder the internal energy flux for the ducted propeller at this plane is more irregular and can be traced back to several flow features firstly from the propulsion unit we have both the duct and propeller losses in addition to that the different rudder design seems to contribute significantly to the higher internal energy flux for the ducted propeller case the hub vortex hits the rudder leading edge due to the lack of a rudder bulb and hub cap the rudder profile is also thicker 25 and less streamlined moreover the rudder for the ducted propeller configuration has oval shaped horizontal plates on the upper and lower edges from which the internal energy flux traces are clearly visible in fig 10 since the propeller slipstream accelerates to higher velocities for the ducted propeller configuration higher boundary layer losses are expected to be able to quantify the additional losses associated with the different rudder designs it could have been of interest to study them separately in otherwise identical configurations in general to improve the systems through enhancing the rudder hydrodynamic performance the viscous loss associated with the rudder is one important parameter which is easily visualized through the internal energy flux however the viscous losses must be studied together with the other energy fluxes as well as maneuvering capacity since a reduction in the viscous losses may imply an increase in any of the other energy components to get further insight in the usefulness of the axial kinetic energy flux pressure work term these terms can also be visualized in general large velocity or pressure perturbations relative to the vessel speed imply strong gradients in the flow field that eventually will mix out downstream and dissipate in the form of internal energy in other words to minimize the axial non uniformity losses as homogeneous flow field as possible is preferable figs 11 and 12 show the axial kinetic energy flux through sections located between the propeller and the rudder as well as downstream the rudder respectively a less uniform wake is noted for the ducted propeller configuration at both instances which implies higher axial non uniformity losses since these flow fields will need to equalize downstream this also means that the spatially non uniform ducted propeller slip stream depicted in fig 11 most probably contribute to the large conversion to internal energy over the rudder region as noted above the level of axial flow non uniformity can possibly be evaluated through analyzing the conversion to internal energy flux over a control volume downstream the rudder however difficulties arise when the region with reasonably refined grid behind the vessel is too short so the rate of conversion to internal energy has the same order of magnitude as the accuracy of the energy balance method in an unsteady flow as observed in this study some possible use of the energy balance analysis for design improvements have been brought up above however on a more general level from the energy balance perspective there are three overall strategies to improve the system reducing transverse flows behind the vessel obtaining a more uniform flow field in the axial direction and reducing viscous losses an improvement in one aspect often implies an increment in other losses for instance a reduction in transverse kinetic losses often costs in form of increased viscous losses to be able to predict the interplay between the various loss components in advance experience of the use of energy balance analyses is preferable to facilitate learning between projects a standardized methodology for both cfd setup and post processing is highly recommended since the distribution into the various energy flux components is depends not only on control volume extension but also computational grid 5 conclusions we have shown that a control volume analysis of energy applied on cfd results provide an alternative approach for studying the required delivered power of a vessel the energy balance analysis is not a method replacing the traditional propulsive factors for ship scale performance predictions but however a promising tool for describing understanding and improving flow physics and associated system performance independent of system configuration it is a post processing tool with the only additional requirement of solving the energy equation which can be employed in any cfd code based on commonly available variables the energy balance analysis provide a very good illustration of the viscous losses through internal and turbulent kinetic energy fluxes as well as transverse kinetic energy losses the axial non uniformity losses are mostly illustrated visually in this paper however similar to the other loss components the quantification of the axial non uniformity losses is of a great interest and will be studied in the future associated with this is also studies on the most suitable control volume for these kind of analyses for a range of configurations additionally further understanding of the required power can be achieved by studying the flow field and energy balance through out a full blade revolution cycle the method is fully dependent on cfd results to describe the flow around the vessel and propulsion unit accurately therefore further method validation has to be carried out for different types of vessels and propulsor configurations at various operating conditions in both model and full scale acknowledgements this research is supported by the

bouaanani and miquel proposed a simplified procedure for finding the modal dynamic and earthquake response of the coupled flexible beam fluid systems bouaanani and miquel 2015 in this study it was assumed that the beam had lateral interaction with one or two semi infinite fluid domain it is worthwhile to highlight that an effective scheme for finding the solution of linear and nonlinear boundary initial and eigenvalue problems is the differential transformation method dtm this semi analytical technique is based on taylor series expansion abdel halim hassan 2008 chen and ho 1996 jang

circular plates based on dtm yalcin et al 2009 analogously lal and ahlawat 2015 analyzed the free vibration of a functionally graded circular plate lal and ahlawat 2015 to authors best knowledge dtm has not been previously employed in free vibration analysis of the beam fluid system although it has been applied in different eigenvalue problems consequently this paper aims to find the free vibration solution of a beam vibrating in contact with a finite fluid domain by taking advantage of the differential transformation approach in this process various boundary conditions are considered for the beam besides these activities proper comparison studies will be performed and the related discussions will be given throughout the article the rest of this paper is organized as follows based on the assumption that the liquid is inviscid irrotational and incompressible section 2 presents the coupled boundary value problem governing the free vibration of the flexible beam in contact with the finite fluid domain in section 3 the differential transformation method is briefly introduced after that section 4 applies this semi analytical approach for finding the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the flexible beam vibrating in contact with the fluid the finite element formulation of this problem is proposed in section 5 at the next stage the developed formulas are utilized in several different numerical examples in section 6 finally the conclusions are summarized in section 7 2 problem definition the current fluid structure problem includes a slender beam of height h vibrating in contact with fluid on one side as shown in fig 1 the geometry of the fluid domain is rectangular with constant height equal to that of the beam and its length is l the right side of the fluid domain is limited to a rigid beam the beam is presumed to be slender hence euler bernoulli beam theory is applied and only its flexural deformations are taken into account furthermore the beam is made of a linear homogenous and isotropic elastic material it is worth highlighting that only small deflections normal to the undeformed beam axis are included it should be added that the fluid is assumed to be incompressible irrotational and inviscid moreover the liquid remains in full contact with the beam due to the fact that the small displacements are considered it is worth emphasizing that the boundary conditions of the beam can be clamped free cf as illustrated in fig 1 or clamped pinned cp clamped sliding cs clamped clamped cc pinned pinned pp or pinned sliding ps as shown in fig 2 respectively bouaanani and miquel 2015 chen et al 2009 it should be reminded that the rotation and deflection of the beam are zero at the clamped c ends and the shear force and the rotation are equal to zero at the sliding s ones moreover the shear force and the deflection of free f and pinned p ends are zero correspondingly furthermore the flexural moment equals zero at the pinned and free ends laplace equation is the governing differential equation of the incompressible irrotational and inviscid fluid for the free vibration analysis and it has the subsequent form sandberg and ohayon 1 2 p x 2 2 p y 2 0 in which the unknown pressure function is shown by p recall that the pressure is a function of coordinates x y in the frequency domain the uniform beams equation of motion has the next appearance 2 e i 4 u y 4 ρ a ω 2 u p 0 y ω in this relation e i a and ρ are the flexural stiffness cross sectional area and mass density of the beam respectively furthermore ω is the natural frequency of the whole system these equations can be rewritten in terms of ξ x l and η y h correspondingly as follows 3 1 l 2 2 p ξ 2 1 h 2 2 p η 2 0 4 4 u η 4 ρ a h 4 ω 2 e i u h 4 e i p 0 η ω where p and u are the unknown pressure and deflection functions respectively these functions are depending on ω ξ and η by using these parameters the following simple domains are applicable 0 ξ 1 and 0 η 1 in this paper the fluid free surface motion is ignored consequently the next boundary condition can be written 5 p ξ 1 ω 0 note that the flux on fluid s boundaries is equal to the negative normal acceleration of the boundary multiplied by the fluid mass density rezaiee pajand et al 2016 therefore the flux is zero at the bottom and right side of the fluid domain because the free vibration is considered during this study hence the following conditions should be satisfied 6 p η ξ 0 ω 0 7 p ξ 1 η ω 0 in addition the dependent boundary condition named interaction boundary condition exists this boundary condition is dependent on both of the beam and fluid responses if ρ f denotes the fluid density the dependent boundary condition has the next formula 8 p ξ 1 η ω l ρ f ω 2 u 3 differential transformation method to explain the main tool dtm is briefly introduced in this approach the solution of the differential equation is expressed in the coming form nourifar et al 2018 rezaiee pajand and hashemian 2017 9 f x k 0 f k x x 0 k obviously this relation denotes the taylor series for f x about x x 0 furthermore f k is the differential transformed function which has the next appearance 10 f k 1 k d k f x d x k x x 0 inserting the last relation into eq 9 leads to the coming result 11 f x k 0 x x 0 k k d k f x d x k x x 0 in practice this infinite series is truncated to achieve a finite one as follows 12 f x k 0 n x x 0 k k d k f x d x k x x 0 in the former relationship n is the number of the terms used in the response series which is selected by the convergence test with the help of the basic definition of differential transformation certain laws of transformational operations are held nourifar et al 2017 among them some famous ones are listed in table 1 4 applying dtm at the first stage it is assumed that the pressure function has the subsequent formula rezaiee pajand et al 2016 13 p ξ η ω j 1 z j ξ cos λ j η where 14 λ j 2 j 1 π 2 j 1 2 obviously the pressure function 13 automatically satisfies relations 5 and 6 which are related to the free surface and bottom of the fluid domain respectively clearly the pressure is a series and each of its term should satisfy equation 3 after some basic mathematical operations the coming relation can be achieved 15 z j ξ λ 2 j z j ξ cos λ j η 0 in which 16 λ j l h λ j accordingly the next differential equation is required to be solved for finding the pressure function 17 z j ξ λ 2 j z j ξ 0 to find the solution of the last equation dtm is desired to be utilized to perform this action z j ξ is expressed in the succeeding form 18 z j ξ k 0 z j k ξ k in this relation z k has the next formula 19 z j k 1 k d k z ξ d ξ k ξ 0 additionally based on table 1 z j ξ is written as below 20 z j ξ k 0 k 1 k 2 z j k 2 ξ k consequently the following recurrence equation can be obtained 21 z j k 2 λ j 2 k 2 k 1 z j k accordingly the succeeding results can be achieved 22 z j 2 λ j 2 2 z j 0 23 z j 3 λ j 2 3 z j 1 24 z j 4 λ j 2 4 3 z j 2 λ j 4 4 z j 0 25 z j 5 λ j 2 5 4 z j 3 λ j 4 5 z j 1 26 z j 6 λ j 2 6 5 z j 4 λ j 6 6 z j 0 27 z j 7 λ j 2 7 6 z j 5 λ j 6 7 z j 1 clearly for the even and odd values of k z j k is related to z j 0 and z j 1 respectively therefore the consequent relations are deduced 28 z j 2 k λ j 2 k 2 k z j 0 29 z j 2 k 1 λ j 2 k 2 k 1 z j 1 from eq 7 and with the help of definition 18 the differential transform of the boundary condition at ξ 1 can be achieved as follows 30 k 1 k z j k 0 by using equalities 28 and 29 relation 30 can be changed into the coming shape 31 z j 0 λ j λ j 1 λ j 3 3 z j 1 1 λ j 2 2 λ j 4 4 0 consequently the next is obtained 32 z j 1 λ j z j 0 d j c j where 33 d j k 0 λ j 2 k 1 2 k 1 34 c j k 0 λ j 2 k 2 k now the interaction boundary condition i e eq 8 is rewritten as follows 35 j 1 z j 0 c o s λ j η l ρ f ω 2 u similarly the deflection function of the beam can be expressed in the subsequent form 36 u η k 0 u k η k by employing equations 18 and 36 the succeeding result is obtained 37 j 1 z j 1 c o s λ j η l ρ f ω 2 k 0 u k η k to find z j 1 both sides of this relation are multiplied by cos λ j η and integrated from 0 to 1 based on the orthogonal property of cosine function the next expression can be written 38 z j 1 2 l ρ f ω 2 k 0 b k j u k in which 39 b k j 0 1 c o s λ j η η k d η this integration results in a hypergeometric function which has the following appearance 40 b k j 1 f 2 k 2 2 1 2 3 k 2 λ j 2 2 q 0 k 2 2 q 4 λ j 2 q q 1 2 q 3 k 2 q it is worth mentioning that the hypergeometric function includes many other special functions as specific or limiting cases and it is represented by the hypergeometric series in relation 40 q denotes the pochhammer symbol hence the subsequent relations can be defined 41 k 2 2 q 1 q 0 k 2 2 k 2 2 1 k 2 2 q 1 q 0 42 3 k 2 q 1 q 0 3 k 2 3 k 2 1 3 k 2 q 1 q 0 43 1 2 q 1 q 0 1 2 3 2 1 2 q q 0 it should be reminded that a definite integral is defined by dtm in eq 39 arikoglu and ozkol 2005 2008 with the help of relations 32 and 38 z j 0 can be computed as below 44 z j 0 2 l ρ f ω 2 c j λ j d j k 0 b k j u k up to now it is proved that z j k can be expressed in terms of z j 0 in other words by finding z j 0 other z j k are achieved based on the presented relationships dtm version of the beam governing equation is accessible prior to this by inserting eq 13 into relationship 4 this equation is expressed as follows 45 4 u η 4 ρ a h 4 ω 2 e i u h 4 e i j 1 z j 0 cos λ j η with the help of table 1 the succeeding recurrence formula is gained 46 u k 4 1 k 4 k 3 k 2 k 1 ρ a h 4 ω 2 e i u k h 4 e i j 1 z j 0 g k j 47 g k j λ j k k cos k π 2 introducing relation 44 into equation 46 leads to the coming result 48 u k 4 ω 2 k 4 k 3 k 2 k 1 ρ a h 4 e i u k l 0 e k l u l where 49 e k l 2 l ρ f h 4 e i j 1 c j λ j d j g k j b l j as previously mentioned the infinite series 18 and 36 should be truncated for the practice propose and only their first n terms are utilized furthermore the pressure function 13 includes infinite terms similarly it should be truncated and only its first m terms are applied in other words only m terms of series whose numerator is j are deployed with the help of equation 36 and by finding u 0 u 1 u 2 and u n 1 the beam deflection function can be approximately achieved then by employing relations 13 18 and 44 the pressure function is estimated to compute these n unknowns n equations are required shiri 2013 it is obvious that relation 48 can produce n 4 equations the boundary conditions related to the beam ends establish the four lasting ones it should be reminded that various boundary conditions of the beam are presented in section 2 it is worth mentioning this system of equations is homogenous and setting the determinant of its coefficient matrix equal to zero results in the natural frequencies of the vibrating fluid structure system furthermore the pressure and deflection functions which construct the coupled mode shapes of this vibrating system can be calculated the obtained results will be presented in section 6 from mathematical point of view the application of dtm in a boundary value problem with coupled boundary conditions is interesting in itself to the authors best knowledge other researchers have mostly solved the coupled problems in which each condition is dependent on one of the unknown functions abazari and abazari 2012 odibat et al 2010 rajasekaran 2013 borhanifar and abazari 2010 in fact none of them has the generality of authors formulations 5 the finite element method in the previous section the coupled boundary value problem governing the free vibration of a fluid structure system was solved by using the differential transformation method now the well known finite element scheme is applied and the related governing equations are discretized the finite element approach divides a domain into sub regions referred to as elements as a result the governing differential equations whose response functions are continuous are changed into a system of linear equations by solving the new discretized version of the initial continuous problem the values of the unknown functions in a limited number of points named nodes are obtained fig 3 schematically depicts the discretized model of the problem the discretized version of the coupled undamped free vibration equation of the system has the next appearance aftabi and lotfi 2010 rezaiee pajand et al 2018 50 k b t 0 h ω 2 m 0 ρ f b 0 d p 0 in these relations the stiffness and mass matrix of the flexible beam are shown by k and m respectively these two matrices have n s rows and columns it should be mentioned that n s is equal to the numbers of the flexible beams degrees of freedom additionally h is a generalized stiffness matrix of the fluid which has n f rows and columns it should be noted that the number of fluid s degrees of freedom equals n f moreover b is a rectangular matrix which is referred to as the interaction matrix and relates the structural degrees of freedom to those of the fluid this matrix has n f rows and n s columns to establish these matrices the corresponding matrix of each element is required for the assembling process besides d and p denote the nodal displacements and pressures vectors respectively these vectors contain n s and n f entries correspondingly by using eq 50 the pressure vector can be obtained as follows 51 p ω 2 ρ f h 1 b d accordingly the coming result can be achieved 52 k ω 2 m m a d 0 where 53 m a ρ f b t h 1 b d it is worthwhile to remark that m a is generally named the added mass matrix whose size is similar to those of the structural characteristics matrices it should be mentioned that n s is equal to the numbers of the flexible beams degrees of freedom in this part the classical 2 node euler bernoulli beam and a four sided element are deployed for modeling the flexible beam and the fluid domain respectively schematically these two elements are illustrated in fig 4 the stiffness and mass matrix of the beam elements has the subsequent shape respectively rao 2005 54 k e 2 e i l e 3 6 3 l e 6 3 l e 3 l e 2 l e 2 3 l e l e

furthermore the generalized stiffness matrix of the fluid has the succeeding form 56 h e 2 3 1 6 1 3 1 6 1 6 2 3 1 6 1 3 1 3 1 6 2 3 1 6 1 6 1 3 1 6 2 3 besides the elemental interaction matrix has

and fluid degrees of freedom respectively as a result the entries of the first and the second rows are zero because only the third and the fourth node of the fluid element are connected to the beam element after establishing the characteristic matrices of the fluid structure system the eigenvalue problem 52 is solved consequently the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the coupled vibrating system are computed 6 numerical examples up to now the free vibration solution of the flexible beam fluid system has been obtained by using the differential transformation method in this section dtm is utilized in various numerical examples in these samples the boundary conditions of the beam ends are different for verification the aforesaid finite element formulation is employed and the natural frequencies and mode shapes of dtm are compared with those of the finite element strategy 6 1 clamped free beam fluid system this sub section deals with the beam fluid system in which the beam base is fixed and its other end is free in this example the structure is made of the material with elasticity modulus e 2 10 10 n m 2 and the density of ρ 2400 kg m 3 additionally its height and thickness are 5 m and 0 5 m correspondingly this beam is adjacent to the fluid domain with the length of 5 m besides the fluid density is ρ f 1000 kg m 3 firstly the finite element approach is utilized for computing the first three natural frequencies of this system different number of elements are used for modeling the beam it should be added that the fluid domain mesh includes square elements in fig 5 the curves which depict the relationship between the obtained values and the number of beam elements are shown the convergence curve proves the correctness of the finite element procedure employed in this study accordingly it is obvious that employing 20 beam elements and a 20 20 mesh for the fluid domain leads to the eigen values with acceptable accuracy and applying finer meshes slightly change the obtained results with the help of the new formulation and for the first three natural frequencies of the system the convergence curves corresponding to the number of terms of the series which forms the dtm solution are achieved at the first stage it is assumed that n 50 and m is increasing for each value of m the first three natural frequencies are computed the results are summarized in fig 6 clearly employing m greater than 3 leads to the fairly analogous results since m 5 yields good results it is assumed that m 5 and n is increasing for each value of n the first three natural frequencies are calculated in fig 7 the curves which demonstrate the relationship between the achieved natural frequencies and n are presented it is clear that the results obtained from n greater equal to 40 are fairly the same based on figs 6 and 7 the correctness of the dtm solution is proved herein by using the differential transformation and finite element techniques the first three natural frequencies of this system are computed and listed in table 2 in the dtm solution procedure it is assumed that m 5 and n 50 moreover 30 elements are applied for modeling the beam in the finite element process note that a 30 30 mesh is utilized for the fluid domain it is worthwhile to mention that the system of equations corresponding to the dtm and the finite element method include 50 and 990 unknowns respectively accordingly the results of the differential transformation method are slightly different from those of the finite element strategy at this stage the mode shapes are calculated by utilizing both dtm and fem it should be reminded that m 5 and n 50 for the differential transformation solution moreover in the finite element process a 30 30 mesh is applied for the fluid domain and 30 elements are used for modeling the beam to have a good revelation the pressure contours are illustrated in fig 8 it is clear that the dtm pressure contours slightly differs from those of fem in other words the differential transformation method is as successful as the finite element approach in computing the mode shapes corresponding to pressure at the next stage the beam mode shapes are computed by using these two numerical techniques and the achieved results are shown in fig 9 according to the obtained results the differential transformation tactic can successfully calculate the mode shapes corresponding to the beam now for the first three mode shapes the pressure distributions on the beam are calculated by using the two aforesaid numerical tactics and they are shown in fig 10 obviously the pressure distribution on the flexible beam obtained from dtm and fem are analogous because the sloshing is ignored the pressure is zero at the free surface in these three mode shapes 6 2 clamped clamped beam fluid system this sub section investigates the beam fluid system in which both ends are fixed in this example the beam elasticity modulus and density are e 2 10 10 n m 2 and ρ 2400 kg m 3 respectively moreover its height and thickness are 6 m and 0 6 m correspondingly and the fluid domain length is 3 m additionally the fluid density is ρ f 1000 kg m 3 now the finite element strategy is applied for calculating the first three natural frequencies of this system various numbers of elements are utilized for modeling the beam once again the fluid elements are square in fig 11 the curves which illustrate the relationship between the computed values and the number of beam elements are presented with the help of these curves the correctness of the finite element formulation is corroborated it is clear that employing 18 elements for the beam and a 18 9 mesh for the fluid domain results in natural frequencies with high accuracy obviously using finer meshes has slight effects on the calculated results at the next stage the convergence curves corresponding to the number of terms of the series which forms the dtm solution are presented firstly it is presumed that n 50 and m can be increased for each value of m the first three natural frequencies are calculated the achieved results are illustrated in fig 12 based on this figure using m greater than three results in the fairly similar results now it is presumed that m 5 and n can be increased for each value of n the first three natural frequencies are computed in an analogous manner the curves which depict the relationship between the computed natural frequencies and n are proposed in fig 13 according to the obtained results the natural frequencies achieved from n greater equal to 40 are fairly the same figs 12 and 13 prove the correctness of the dtm solution at this stage by applying the differential transformation and finite element approaches the first three natural frequencies of this system are calculated and tabulated in table 3 in the dtm solution process m 5 and n 50 are utilized furthermore 24 elements are employed for modeling the beam in the finite element procedure note that the fluid domain is modeled with the help of square elements i e a 24 12 mesh accordingly the results of the differential transformation method are very close to those of the finite element scheme now the mode shapes are computed by applying these two numerical strategies in this process m 5 and n 50 for the differential transformation solution besides in the finite element procedure a 24 12 mesh is applied for the fluid domain and 24 elements are employed for modeling the beam in fig 14 the pressure contours are illustrated obviously the pressure contours of dtm are very similar to those of the fem the differences are rooted in the errors which exist in both numerical approaches in what follows the beam mode shapes are presented in fig 15 based on this figure the differential transformation scheme can successfully calculate the mode shapes corresponding to the flexible beam now for the first three mode shapes fig 16 clearly demonstrates the pressure distributions on the clamped clamped beam based on the numerical outcomes the differential transformation method is as successful as the finite element approach in computing the pressure distribution on the flexible beam 6 3 natural frequencies of beam fluid systems with different boundary conditions at this stage dtm is applied to calculate the first three natural frequencies of the systems with various boundary conditions in this process it is presumed that m 5 and n 50 previously all boundary conditions were introduced for investigating the robustness of the differential transformation tactic the natural frequencies are also computed by the finite element approach for this purpose the beams are modeled by using 30 elements and the fluid domain mesh includes square elements i e a 30 60 mesh in these coupled beam fluid systems it is assumed that the beams are made of the material with elasticity modulus e 2 10 10 n m 2 and density of ρ 2400 kg m 3 furthermore their height and thickness are 5 m and 0 5 m respectively in addition the lengths of fluid domains are equal to 10 m and the fluid density is ρ f 1000 kg m 3 in table 4 the obtained results are demonstrated it is obvious that dtm can successfully compute the first three natural frequencies of the beam fluid systems with various boundary conditions 7 conclusions this paper was devoted to formulate the differential transformation method in free vibration analysis of a coupled flexible beam fluid system with various boundary conditions it should be highlighted that a coupled partial differential equations and the related boundary conditions govern this problem the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes of the various flexible beam fluid systems were obtained by employing both the differential transformation and finite element techniques all findings prove that almost the same results can be achieved by these two strategies it should be emphasized that the differential transformation method is simpler in use than the finite element scheme from the views of computer programing and also implementation aspects

circular plates based on dtm yalcin et al 2009 analogously lal and ahlawat 2015 analyzed the free vibration of a functionally graded circular plate lal and ahlawat 2015 to authors best knowledge dtm has not been previously employed in free vibration analysis of the beam fluid system although it has been applied in different eigenvalue problems consequently this paper aims to find the free vibration solution of a beam vibrating in contact with a finite fluid domain by taking advantage of the differential transformation approach in this process various boundary conditions are considered for the beam besides these activities proper comparison studies will be performed and the related discussions will be given throughout the article the rest of this paper is organized as follows based on the assumption that the liquid is inviscid irrotational and incompressible section 2 presents the coupled boundary value problem governing the free vibration of the flexible beam in contact with the finite fluid domain in section 3 the differential transformation method is briefly introduced after that section 4 applies this semi analytical approach for finding the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the flexible beam vibrating in contact with the fluid the finite element formulation of this problem is proposed in section 5 at the next stage the developed formulas are utilized in several different numerical examples in section 6 finally the conclusions are summarized in section 7 2 problem definition the current fluid structure problem includes a slender beam of height h vibrating in contact with fluid on one side as shown in fig 1 the geometry of the fluid domain is rectangular with constant height equal to that of the beam and its length is l the right side of the fluid domain is limited to a rigid beam the beam is presumed to be slender hence euler bernoulli beam theory is applied and only its flexural deformations are taken into account furthermore the beam is made of a linear homogenous and isotropic elastic material it is worth highlighting that only small deflections normal to the undeformed beam axis are included it should be added that the fluid is assumed to be incompressible irrotational and inviscid moreover the liquid remains in full contact with the beam due to the fact that the small displacements are considered it is worth emphasizing that the boundary conditions of the beam can be clamped free cf as illustrated in fig 1 or clamped pinned cp clamped sliding cs clamped clamped cc pinned pinned pp or pinned sliding ps as shown in fig 2 respectively bouaanani and miquel 2015 chen et al 2009 it should be reminded that the rotation and deflection of the beam are zero at the clamped c ends and the shear force and the rotation are equal to zero at the sliding s ones moreover the shear force and the deflection of free f and pinned p ends are zero correspondingly furthermore the flexural moment equals zero at the pinned and free ends laplace equation is the governing differential equation of the incompressible irrotational and inviscid fluid for the free vibration analysis and it has the subsequent form sandberg and ohayon 1 2 p x 2 2 p y 2 0 in which the unknown pressure function is shown by p recall that the pressure is a function of coordinates x y in the frequency domain the uniform beams equation of motion has the next appearance 2 e i 4 u y 4 ρ a ω 2 u p 0 y ω in this relation e i a and ρ are the flexural stiffness cross sectional area and mass density of the beam respectively furthermore ω is the natural frequency of the whole system these equations can be rewritten in terms of ξ x l and η y h correspondingly as follows 3 1 l 2 2 p ξ 2 1 h 2 2 p η 2 0 4 4 u η 4 ρ a h 4 ω 2 e i u h 4 e i p 0 η ω where p and u are the unknown pressure and deflection functions respectively these functions are depending on ω ξ and η by using these parameters the following simple domains are applicable 0 ξ 1 and 0 η 1 in this paper the fluid free surface motion is ignored consequently the next boundary condition can be written 5 p ξ 1 ω 0 note that the flux on fluid s boundaries is equal to the negative normal acceleration of the boundary multiplied by the fluid mass density rezaiee pajand et al 2016 therefore the flux is zero at the bottom and right side of the fluid domain because the free vibration is considered during this study hence the following conditions should be satisfied 6 p η ξ 0 ω 0 7 p ξ 1 η ω 0 in addition the dependent boundary condition named interaction boundary condition exists this boundary condition is dependent on both of the beam and fluid responses if ρ f denotes the fluid density the dependent boundary condition has the next formula 8 p ξ 1 η ω l ρ f ω 2 u 3 differential transformation method to explain the main tool dtm is briefly introduced in this approach the solution of the differential equation is expressed in the coming form nourifar et al 2018 rezaiee pajand and hashemian 2017 9 f x k 0 f k x x 0 k obviously this relation denotes the taylor series for f x about x x 0 furthermore f k is the differential transformed function which has the next appearance 10 f k 1 k d k f x d x k x x 0 inserting the last relation into eq 9 leads to the coming result 11 f x k 0 x x 0 k k d k f x d x k x x 0 in practice this infinite series is truncated to achieve a finite one as follows 12 f x k 0 n x x 0 k k d k f x d x k x x 0 in the former relationship n is the number of the terms used in the response series which is selected by the convergence test with the help of the basic definition of differential transformation certain laws of transformational operations are held nourifar et al 2017 among them some famous ones are listed in table 1 4 applying dtm at the first stage it is assumed that the pressure function has the subsequent formula rezaiee pajand et al 2016 13 p ξ η ω j 1 z j ξ cos λ j η where 14 λ j 2 j 1 π 2 j 1 2 obviously the pressure function 13 automatically satisfies relations 5 and 6 which are related to the free surface and bottom of the fluid domain respectively clearly the pressure is a series and each of its term should satisfy equation 3 after some basic mathematical operations the coming relation can be achieved 15 z j ξ λ 2 j z j ξ cos λ j η 0 in which 16 λ j l h λ j accordingly the next differential equation is required to be solved for finding the pressure function 17 z j ξ λ 2 j z j ξ 0 to find the solution of the last equation dtm is desired to be utilized to perform this action z j ξ is expressed in the succeeding form 18 z j ξ k 0 z j k ξ k in this relation z k has the next formula 19 z j k 1 k d k z ξ d ξ k ξ 0 additionally based on table 1 z j ξ is written as below 20 z j ξ k 0 k 1 k 2 z j k 2 ξ k consequently the following recurrence equation can be obtained 21 z j k 2 λ j 2 k 2 k 1 z j k accordingly the succeeding results can be achieved 22 z j 2 λ j 2 2 z j 0 23 z j 3 λ j 2 3 z j 1 24 z j 4 λ j 2 4 3 z j 2 λ j 4 4 z j 0 25 z j 5 λ j 2 5 4 z j 3 λ j 4 5 z j 1 26 z j 6 λ j 2 6 5 z j 4 λ j 6 6 z j 0 27 z j 7 λ j 2 7 6 z j 5 λ j 6 7 z j 1 clearly for the even and odd values of k z j k is related to z j 0 and z j 1 respectively therefore the consequent relations are deduced 28 z j 2 k λ j 2 k 2 k z j 0 29 z j 2 k 1 λ j 2 k 2 k 1 z j 1 from eq 7 and with the help of definition 18 the differential transform of the boundary condition at ξ 1 can be achieved as follows 30 k 1 k z j k 0 by using equalities 28 and 29 relation 30 can be changed into the coming shape 31 z j 0 λ j λ j 1 λ j 3 3 z j 1 1 λ j 2 2 λ j 4 4 0 consequently the next is obtained 32 z j 1 λ j z j 0 d j c j where 33 d j k 0 λ j 2 k 1 2 k 1 34 c j k 0 λ j 2 k 2 k now the interaction boundary condition i e eq 8 is rewritten as follows 35 j 1 z j 0 c o s λ j η l ρ f ω 2 u similarly the deflection function of the beam can be expressed in the subsequent form 36 u η k 0 u k η k by employing equations 18 and 36 the succeeding result is obtained 37 j 1 z j 1 c o s λ j η l ρ f ω 2 k 0 u k η k to find z j 1 both sides of this relation are multiplied by cos λ j η and integrated from 0 to 1 based on the orthogonal property of cosine function the next expression can be written 38 z j 1 2 l ρ f ω 2 k 0 b k j u k in which 39 b k j 0 1 c o s λ j η η k d η this integration results in a hypergeometric function which has the following appearance 40 b k j 1 f 2 k 2 2 1 2 3 k 2 λ j 2 2 q 0 k 2 2 q 4 λ j 2 q q 1 2 q 3 k 2 q it is worth mentioning that the hypergeometric function includes many other special functions as specific or limiting cases and it is represented by the hypergeometric series in relation 40 q denotes the pochhammer symbol hence the subsequent relations can be defined 41 k 2 2 q 1 q 0 k 2 2 k 2 2 1 k 2 2 q 1 q 0 42 3 k 2 q 1 q 0 3 k 2 3 k 2 1 3 k 2 q 1 q 0 43 1 2 q 1 q 0 1 2 3 2 1 2 q q 0 it should be reminded that a definite integral is defined by dtm in eq 39 arikoglu and ozkol 2005 2008 with the help of relations 32 and 38 z j 0 can be computed as below 44 z j 0 2 l ρ f ω 2 c j λ j d j k 0 b k j u k up to now it is proved that z j k can be expressed in terms of z j 0 in other words by finding z j 0 other z j k are achieved based on the presented relationships dtm version of the beam governing equation is accessible prior to this by inserting eq 13 into relationship 4 this equation is expressed as follows 45 4 u η 4 ρ a h 4 ω 2 e i u h 4 e i j 1 z j 0 cos λ j η with the help of table 1 the succeeding recurrence formula is gained 46 u k 4 1 k 4 k 3 k 2 k 1 ρ a h 4 ω 2 e i u k h 4 e i j 1 z j 0 g k j 47 g k j λ j k k cos k π 2 introducing relation 44 into equation 46 leads to the coming result 48 u k 4 ω 2 k 4 k 3 k 2 k 1 ρ a h 4 e i u k l 0 e k l u l where 49 e k l 2 l ρ f h 4 e i j 1 c j λ j d j g k j b l j as previously mentioned the infinite series 18 and 36 should be truncated for the practice propose and only their first n terms are utilized furthermore the pressure function 13 includes infinite terms similarly it should be truncated and only its first m terms are applied in other words only m terms of series whose numerator is j are deployed with the help of equation 36 and by finding u 0 u 1 u 2 and u n 1 the beam deflection function can be approximately achieved then by employing relations 13 18 and 44 the pressure function is estimated to compute these n unknowns n equations are required shiri 2013 it is obvious that relation 48 can produce n 4 equations the boundary conditions related to the beam ends establish the four lasting ones it should be reminded that various boundary conditions of the beam are presented in section 2 it is worth mentioning this system of equations is homogenous and setting the determinant of its coefficient matrix equal to zero results in the natural frequencies of the vibrating fluid structure system furthermore the pressure and deflection functions which construct the coupled mode shapes of this vibrating system can be calculated the obtained results will be presented in section 6 from mathematical point of view the application of dtm in a boundary value problem with coupled boundary conditions is interesting in itself to the authors best knowledge other researchers have mostly solved the coupled problems in which each condition is dependent on one of the unknown functions abazari and abazari 2012 odibat et al 2010 rajasekaran 2013 borhanifar and abazari 2010 in fact none of them has the generality of authors formulations 5 the finite element method in the previous section the coupled boundary value problem governing the free vibration of a fluid structure system was solved by using the differential transformation method now the well known finite element scheme is applied and the related governing equations are discretized the finite element approach divides a domain into sub regions referred to as elements as a result the governing differential equations whose response functions are continuous are changed into a system of linear equations by solving the new discretized version of the initial continuous problem the values of the unknown functions in a limited number of points named nodes are obtained fig 3 schematically depicts the discretized model of the problem the discretized version of the coupled undamped free vibration

are shown by k and m respectively these two matrices have n s rows and columns it should be mentioned that n s is equal to the numbers of the flexible beams degrees of freedom additionally h is a generalized stiffness matrix of the fluid which has n f rows and columns it should be noted that the number of fluid s degrees of freedom equals n f moreover b is a rectangular matrix which is referred to as the interaction matrix and relates the structural degrees of freedom to those of the fluid this matrix has n f rows and n s columns to establish these matrices the corresponding matrix of each element is required for the assembling process besides d and p denote the nodal displacements and pressures vectors respectively these vectors contain n s and n f entries correspondingly by using eq 50 the pressure vector can be obtained as follows 51 p ω 2 ρ f h 1 b d accordingly the coming result can be achieved 52 k ω 2 m m a d 0 where 53 m a ρ f b t h 1 b d it is worthwhile to remark that m a is generally named the added mass matrix whose size is similar to those of the structural characteristics matrices it should be mentioned that n s is equal to the numbers of the flexible beams degrees of freedom in this part the classical 2 node euler bernoulli beam and a four sided element are deployed for modeling the flexible beam and the fluid domain respectively schematically these two elements are illustrated in fig 4 the stiffness and mass matrix of the beam elements has the subsequent shape respectively rao 2005 54 k e 2 e i l e 3 6 3 l e 6 3 l e 3 l e 2 l e 2 3 l e l e

and fluid degrees of freedom respectively as a result the entries of the first and the second rows are zero because only the third and the fourth node of the fluid element are connected to the beam element after establishing the characteristic matrices of the fluid structure system the eigenvalue problem 52 is solved consequently the natural frequencies and mode shapes of the coupled vibrating system are computed 6 numerical examples up to now the free vibration solution of the flexible beam fluid system has been obtained by using the differential transformation method in this section dtm is utilized in various numerical examples in these samples the boundary conditions of the beam ends are different for verification the aforesaid finite element formulation is employed and the natural frequencies and mode shapes of dtm are compared with those of the finite element strategy 6 1 clamped free beam fluid system this sub section deals with the beam fluid system in which the beam base is

5 m and 0 5 m correspondingly this beam is adjacent to the fluid domain with the length of 5 m besides the fluid density is ρ f 1000 kg m 3 firstly the finite element approach is utilized for computing the first three natural frequencies of this system different number of elements are used for modeling the beam it should be added that the fluid domain mesh includes square elements in fig 5 the curves which depict the relationship between the obtained values and the number of beam elements are shown the convergence curve proves the correctness of the finite element procedure employed in this study accordingly it is obvious that employing 20 beam elements and a 20 20 mesh for the fluid domain leads to the eigen values with acceptable accuracy and applying finer meshes slightly change the obtained results with the help of the new formulation and for the first three natural frequencies of the system the convergence curves corresponding to the number of terms of the series which forms the dtm solution are achieved at the first stage it is assumed that n 50 and m is increasing for each value of m the first three natural frequencies are computed the results are summarized in fig 6 clearly employing m greater than 3 leads to the fairly analogous results since m 5 yields good results it is assumed that m 5 and n is increasing for each value of n the first three natural frequencies are calculated in fig 7 the curves which demonstrate the relationship between the achieved natural frequencies and n are presented it is clear that the results obtained from n greater equal to 40 are fairly the same based on figs 6 and 7 the correctness of the dtm solution is proved herein by using the differential transformation and finite element techniques the first three natural frequencies of this system are computed and listed in table 2 in the dtm solution procedure it is assumed that m 5 and n 50 moreover 30 elements are applied for modeling the beam in the finite element process note that a 30 30 mesh is utilized for the fluid domain it is worthwhile to mention that the system of equations corresponding to the dtm and the finite element method include 50 and 990 unknowns respectively accordingly the results of the differential transformation method are slightly different from those of the finite element strategy at this stage the mode shapes are calculated by utilizing both dtm and fem it should be reminded that m 5 and n 50 for the differential transformation solution moreover in the finite element process a 30 30 mesh is applied for the fluid domain and 30 elements are used for modeling the beam to have a good revelation the pressure contours are illustrated in fig 8 it is clear that the dtm pressure contours slightly differs from those of fem in other words the differential transformation method is as successful as the finite element approach in computing the mode shapes corresponding to pressure at the next stage the beam mode shapes are computed by using these two numerical techniques and the achieved results are shown in fig 9 according to the obtained results the differential transformation tactic can successfully calculate the mode shapes corresponding to the beam now for the first three mode shapes the pressure distributions on the beam are calculated by using the two aforesaid numerical tactics and they are shown in fig 10 obviously the pressure distribution on the flexible beam obtained from dtm and fem are analogous because the sloshing is ignored the pressure is zero at the free surface in these three mode shapes 6 2 clamped clamped beam fluid system this sub section investigates the beam fluid system in which both ends are fixed in this example the beam elasticity modulus and density are e 2 10 10 n m 2 and ρ 2400 kg m 3 respectively moreover its height and thickness are 6 m and 0 6 m correspondingly and the fluid domain length is 3 m additionally the fluid density is ρ f 1000 kg m 3 now the finite element strategy is applied for calculating the first three natural frequencies of this system various numbers of elements are utilized for modeling the beam once again the fluid elements are square in fig 11 the curves which illustrate the relationship between the computed values and the number of beam elements are presented with the help of these curves the correctness of the finite element formulation is corroborated it is clear that employing 18 elements for the beam and a 18 9 mesh for the fluid domain results in natural frequencies with high accuracy obviously using finer meshes has slight effects on the calculated results at the next stage the convergence curves corresponding to the number of terms of the series which forms the dtm solution are presented firstly it is presumed that n 50 and m can be increased for each value of m the first three natural frequencies are calculated the achieved results are illustrated in fig 12 based on this figure using m greater than three results in the fairly similar results now it is presumed that m 5 and n can be increased for each value of n the first three natural frequencies are computed in an analogous manner the curves which depict the relationship between the computed natural frequencies and n are proposed in fig 13 according to the obtained results the natural frequencies achieved from n greater equal to 40 are fairly the same figs 12 and 13 prove the correctness of the dtm solution at this stage by applying the differential transformation and finite element approaches the first three natural frequencies of this system are calculated and tabulated in table 3 in the dtm solution process m 5 and n 50 are utilized furthermore 24 elements are employed for modeling the beam in the finite element procedure note that the fluid domain is modeled with the help of square elements i e a 24 12 mesh accordingly the results of the differential transformation method are very close to those of the finite element scheme now the mode shapes are computed by applying these two numerical strategies in this process m 5 and n 50 for the differential transformation solution besides in the finite element procedure a 24 12 mesh is applied for the fluid domain and 24 elements are employed for modeling the beam in fig 14 the pressure contours are illustrated obviously the pressure contours of dtm are very similar to those of the fem the differences are rooted in the errors which exist in both numerical approaches in what follows the beam mode shapes are presented in fig 15 based on this figure the differential transformation scheme can successfully calculate the mode shapes corresponding to the flexible beam now for the first three mode shapes fig 16 clearly demonstrates the pressure distributions on the clamped clamped beam based on the numerical outcomes the differential transformation method is as successful as the finite element approach in computing the pressure distribution on the flexible beam 6 3 natural frequencies of beam fluid systems with different boundary conditions at this stage dtm is applied to calculate the first three natural frequencies of the systems with various boundary conditions in this process it is presumed that m 5 and n 50 previously all boundary conditions were introduced for investigating the robustness of the differential transformation tactic the natural frequencies are also computed by the finite element approach for this purpose the beams are modeled by using 30 elements and the fluid domain mesh includes square elements i e a 30 60 mesh in these coupled beam fluid systems it is assumed that the beams are made of the material with elasticity modulus e 2 10 10 n m 2 and density of ρ 2400 kg m 3 furthermore their height and thickness are 5 m and 0 5 m respectively in addition the lengths of fluid domains are equal to 10 m and the fluid density is ρ f 1000 kg m 3 in table 4 the obtained results are demonstrated it is obvious that dtm can successfully compute the first three natural frequencies of the beam fluid systems with various boundary conditions 7 conclusions this paper was devoted to formulate the differential transformation method in free vibration analysis of a coupled flexible beam fluid system with various boundary conditions it should be highlighted that a coupled partial differential equations and the related boundary conditions govern this problem the natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes of the various flexible beam fluid systems were obtained by employing both the differential transformation and finite element techniques all findings prove that almost the same results can be achieved by these two strategies it should be emphasized that the differential transformation method is simpler in use than the finite element scheme from the views of computer programing and also implementation aspects
