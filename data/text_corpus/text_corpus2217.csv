11085,the constant need to increase agricultural production together with the more and more frequent drought events in many areas of the world requires a more careful assessment of irrigation needs and therefore a more accurate estimation of actual evapotranspiration in recent years several water management issues have been addressed by means of models derived from artificial intelligence research when using machine learning based models the main challenging aspects are represented by the choice of the best possible algorithm the choice of adequately representative variables and the availability of appropriate data sets machine learning algorithms may be a powerful tool for the prediction of actual evapotranspiration when a time series of few years is available starting from the measurements of a sufficient number of climatic parameters it is possible to obtain forecasting models characterized by very high accuracy and precision three different evapotranspiration models have been compared in this study the models differ in the input variables four variants of each model were applied varying the machine learning algorithm m5p regression tree bagging random forest and support vector regression the data refers to an experimental site in central florida characterized by humid subtropical climate the best outcomes have been provided by model 1 whose input variables were net solar radiation sensible heat flux moisture content of the soil wind speed mean relative humidity and mean temperature model 3 built from data only of mean temperature mean relative humidity and net solar radiation has provided still satisfactory results model 2 which adds the wind speed to the input variables of model 3 has provided results that are absolutely comparable to those of model 3 itself keywords actual evapotranspiration machine learning regression tree ensemble methods support vector regression irrigation 1 introduction the progressive increase in the world population continuously requires increases in agricultural production agriculture is the anthropic activity that consumes most water the frequent events of drought affecting vast areas of the globe impose a more and more careful management of water resources both on a global scale and on the scale of the individual watersheds a careful estimate of all the components of the water balance in particular of evapotranspiration is essential for a careful planning of irrigation practice evapotranspiration is the combination of two separate processes whereby water is lost on the one hand from the soil surface by evaporation and on the other hand from the crop by transpiration jensen et al 2016 evaporation turns liquid water into water vapour which is removed from the evaporating surfaces generally lakes rivers soils and wet vegetation the energy required for the conversion process is provided by solar radiation and air temperature vapour pressure deficit and wind speed enhance the diffusion of water vapour in the atmosphere therefore solar radiation air temperature air humidity and wind speed are climatological parameters that mainly affect the evaporation process transpiration is the process by which the liquid water contained in plant organisms is vaporized and lost through the small stomatal openings on the leaves transpiration as well as direct evaporation depends on radiation air temperature air humidity and wind speed moreover transpiration is highly depending on crop characteristics and agricultural practices evaporation and transpiration are two simultaneous and almost indistinguishable processes kool et al 2014 an assessment that does not consider the factors characterizing the crops can be done by introducing the concept of reference evapotranspiration jensen 1968 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 that is generally denoted as et0 reference evapotranspiration is a climatic parameter and therefore depends only on climatic variables actual evapotranspiration eta can be evaluated from reference evapotranspiration by means of crop coefficients jensen et al 2016 outlined the evolution of evapotranspiration estimating methods over the past century many evapotranspiration estimation models are empirical models based on statistical correlations of evapotranspiration with meteorological parameters abtew and melesse 2013 performance may significantly depend on the location local recalibration may be needed the simplest models are based on temperature only the most popular empirical method the hargreaves samani equation depends on both temperature and solar radiation hargreaves and samani 1982 more complex are energy balance methods requiring knowledge of latent and sensible heat flux the penman monteith p m equation could be considered as a physically based evapotranspiration model jensen et al 2016 it is complete in describing the evapotranspiration because it takes into account moisture availability mass transfer and required energy for the process in any case the quality of evapotranspiration estimates is dependent both on the selected model and the quality of the input data there is so much literature on evapotranspiration that in this context it is practically impossible to propose even a partial review some recent remarkable contributions are due to zhang et al 2018 anapalli et al 2018 pozníková et al 2018 rongfan et al

xu et al 2018 employed different machine learning approaches for upscaling evapotranspiration from flux towers to regional scale however the applications of machine learning techniques to evapotranspiration estimation problems are currently limited and the knowledge on the topic is still partial and fragmented in this study three different data driven models were developed for the forecasting of actual evapotranspiration models differ in input variables four variants of each model were built changing the applied machine learning algorithm which are m5p regression tree bagging random forest and support vector regression in general terms no one machine learning algorithm is the best for all problems the performance of different machine learning algorithms strongly depends on the size and structure of available data the aforementioned algorithms have been chosen because they usually achieve high performance and they are very good at learning complex highly non linear relationships an effective alternative to the considered algorithms is represented by the artificial neural networks which have not been used in this study the models were trained and tested with data obtained in central florida at an experimental site whose vegetation mainly includes pastures of bahia grass 2 material and methods 2 1 algorithms support vector machines vapnik 1995 are supervised learning algorithms able to deal with classification or regression problems given a training dataset x1 y1 x2 y2 xl yl x r where x is the space of the input patterns e g x r n support vector regression svr pursues the goal of identifying a function f x as flat as possible and with a maximum ε deviation from the experimental target values yi fig 1 a hence given a linear function in the form 1 f x w x b in which w x b r and is the dot product in x the euclidean norm w 2 needs to be minimized leading to a constrained convex optimization problem however in many cases a certain error has to be accepted for that reason slack variables ξ ι ξ ι are introduced in the constraints and the optimization problem is formulated as 2 minimize 1 2 w 2 c i 1 l ξ i ξ i 3 subject to y i w x i b ε ξ i w x i b y i ε ξ i where the constant c 0 affects both the function flatness and the tolerated deviations the optimization problem may be properly solved in its dual formulation by means of lagrange multipliers the svr algorithm can be made nonlinear by preliminarily processing the training patterns x i by means of a function φ x f where f is some feature space the svr algorithm fig 1b is only depending on the dot products between the different patterns consequently it is possible to use a kernel k x i x j φ x i φ x j instead of explicitly employing the map φ the kernel functions commonly used in svr based models are linear polynomial radial basis function rbf and sigmoid which one produces the best results depends on the application in this study a rbf was selected as kernel it has the form 4 k x i x j exp γ x i x j 2 γ 0 preliminary tests have shown that the rbf leads to the best results in this specific problem rbf has advantages of good generalization and strong tolerance to input noise a regression tree rt model fig 2 employs a decision tree as predictive model breiman et al 1984 and the target variables take real values internal nodes denote the input variables whereas leaves correspond to given values of the target variables initially all training data is contained in a root node the development of a regression tree model involves the recursive subdivision of the input domain data into subdomains in each subdomain a multivariable linear regression model is used to make predictions the iterative algorithm initially allocates all data into two branches considering all the potential split on every field then the growth procedure of the regression tree is carried on by splitting each branch into smaller partitions as the system develops at each stage the process finds the subdivision in two separate partitions that minimizes the least squared deviation defined as 5 r t 1 n t i t y i y m t 2 where n t is the number of sample units in the node t yi is the value taken by the target variable in the i th unit and ym is the mean of the target variable in the node t this sum evaluates the impurity at each node indeed the split process at each node is conducted on the basis of the following function of r t 6 ϕ s p t r t p l r t l p r r t r in which tl and tr are the left and right nodes generated by the subdivision sp while pl and pr are the portions assigned in the left and right child node finally the split sp that maximizes the value of φ sp t is chosen the procedure is repeated until the lowest impurity level is attained or until a stopping rule is met a stopping rule may depend on the threshold for the minimum impurity variation provided by new splits the minimum amount of units in each node or the maximum tree complexity the algorithm implemented in this study is identified as m5p and arises from quinlan s m5 algorithm quinlan 1992 a fully developed regression tree model may undergo the problem of overfitting that occurs when a machine learning model has become too familiar with the data on which it was trained and therefore it is less effective if applied to any other dataset this risk is generally minimized by means of a pruning process it reduces the size of the regression tree model by removing the splits that do not improve significantly the predicting capability a combination of a number of learning models leads to an ensemble model the outputs of different regression tree models are combined into a single result generally using a weighted average bootstrap aggregating better known as bagging breiman 1996 is one of the most popular ensemble model fig 3 different training datasets having the same size are randomly chosen from the problem domain without replacement for each input dataset a regression tree model is built these trees will be different and will provide different predictions small alterations to the training data may lead to significant changes in ramifications and in forecasts for test instances bagging allows to obtain a combined model that may outperform the single tree model bagging attempts to counteract the instability of the process of regression tree growth by varying the original training dataset instead of sampling a novel training dataset each time some instances are removed and replaced by others at last the single predictions of the regression tree are averaged a set of uncorrelated simple regression trees breiman 2001 also allows to get a random forest one of the most effective ensemble algorithms each tree is developed starting from a different bootstrap sample of the data and each new training set is got with replacement from the original training set in addition random forests are different for the way regression trees are built in a standard tree each node is allocated referring to the best split among all variables during the process of development of a random forest instead at each node a small group of input variables to split on is randomly selected in the case of m input variables a number m m is identified such that at each node m variables are randomly chosen out of the m and the best split on these m is used to divide the node the value of m is kept constant during the growth of the forest each tree is expanded as far as possible no pruning process is carried out 2 2 study site data are provided by u s geological survey they were obtained during a study sumner and jacobs 2005 performed within a commercial farm located on a sand ridge near floral city florida usa fig 4 the farm is surrounded by wetlands a lake and residential areas the water table was approximately 6 9 m below land surface the area is characterized by a subtropical humid climate with a warm wet season lasting from june to september and a mild dry season lasting from october to may the average rainfall in the area is over 1300 mm per year the average annual air temperature is about 21 c in winter it rarely falls below 0 c while in summer it can exceed 35 c due to the evolution of cloud cover net solar radiation typically peaks about a month before the start of summer vegetation near the study site mainly includes pastures of bahia grass paspalum notatum flugge grass height averages about 8 12 cm in the area there are also agricultural fields of strawberries fragaria sp and brown top millet panicum ramosum the data were obtained by an eddy correlation station and ancillary sensors the eddy correlation technique also known as eddy covariance wilson et al 2001 is a key atmospheric measurement technique to evaluate vertical turbulent fluxes within atmospheric boundary layers it achieves turbulent flux data by computing the covariance of fluctuations in the vertical wind velocity and in the physical quantity to be evaluated the detailed characteristics of the measuring instruments can be found in sumner and jacobs 2005 the data used in the calculations were collected continuously between 28 september 2000 and 28 september 2004 3 results and discussion the effectiveness of forecasting models was assessed by means of four different criteria nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse and relative absolute error rae the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is a normalized statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the measured data variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 it is defined as 7 n s e 1 i 1 m y i f i 2 i 1 m y i y a 2 in which m is the experimental data total number fi is the model prediction for data point i yi is the experimental value for data point i ya is the average of the measured values nse is used to assess the predictive power of the model it can range from to 1 essentially the closer to 1 the more accurate the model is the mean absolute error evaluates the average magnitude of the errors in a set of forecasts without considering their sign it s the average over the test sample of the absolute differences between predicted and experimental values it is defined as 8 m a e i 1 m f i y i m rmse is the sample standard deviation of the differences between foreseen and actual values it is given by 9 r m s e i 1 m f i y i 2 m finally rae provides a normalized total absolute error according to the following definition 10 r a e i 1 m f i y i i 1 m y a y i the four adopted criteria are enough to fully characterize the efficiency of the models other evaluation metrics could be used median absolute percentage error mdape mean squared logarithmic error msle fourth root mean quadrupled error r4ms4e and some others dawson et al 2007 mdape is less sensitive to the larger errors occurring at high values r4ms4e is effective in evaluating model goodness of fit on peak and high values the msle due to the logarithmic transformations involved in its computation is a good measure for assessing model performances when predicting low values however preliminary tests have shown that different metrics do not alter the comparison so the use of the adopted more popular metrics was preferred based on the number of input variables three different models were obtained for the prediction of eta four variants of each model were built varying the implemented machine learning algorithm model 1 presents the following daily quantities as input variables net solar radiation sensible heat flux moisture content of the soil wind speed mean relative humidity and mean temperature model 2 is characterized instead by the following input variables net solar radiation wind speed mean relative humidity and mean temperature these variables are essentially the same as the penman monteith model finally model 3 admits as input variables the net solar radiation the mean relative humidity and the mean temperature model 3 is a simpler model than the others based only on the most important climatic variables for evapotranspiration estimation input variables can be measured with simple and inexpensive instruments practically everywhere so a similar model has the advantage of being able to be widely used on the other hand model 1 has the advantage of being quite complete with regard to the climatic input variables therefore it should be characterized by greater accuracy but it can only be used in areas where there are adequate measuring stations model 2 has a slightly larger complexity than model 3 and a slightly smaller applicability each model was developed through a k fold cross validation process using a set of 1360 vectors in k fold cross validation the original dataset is randomly partitioned into k subsets then a single subset is reserved as the validation data for testing the model while the remaining k 1 subsets are used as training data the cross validation process is repeated k times each of the k subsets is used once as the validation dataset finally the k results from the folds are averaged to provide a single estimation in this study k was chosen equal to 10 this value ensures satisfactory results table 1 and figs 5 16 show the effectiveness of the considered models in the evapotranspiration estimate model 1 shows the best predictive capabilities all implemented algorithms lead to very high values of nse table 1 greater than 0 98 in particular m5p is characterized by the highest value of nse and the lowest error values nse 0 987 mae 0 14 mm day rmse 0 179 mm day rae 15 4 the residual plot fig 5b shows that the highest errors occur in the range 0 2 mm the bagging algorithm although it provides remarkable results too is the least effective of the four showing the lowest value of nse equal to 0 98 and the highest error values mae 0 168 mm day rmse 0 219 mm day rae 18 5 also in this case the residual plot shows that the highest errors occur in the range 0 2 mm very similar performances are provided by random forest nse 0 981 mae 0 167 mm day rmse 0 218 mm day rae 18 5 which leads to the highest errors in the range 0 3 mm fig 6b svr which is characterized by nse 0 983 mae 0 153 mm day rmse 0 201 mm day and rae 16 9 shows better performance of both rf and bagging algorithms model 2 shows less effective forecasting capabilities than model 1 table 1 the values of nse are appreciably decreased while the errors are significantly increased however the results are still satisfactory unlike in the case of model 1 random forest provides best outcomes showing the highest value of nse equal to 0 951 and the lowest errors mae 0 267 mm day rmse 0 343 mm day rae 29 3 svr in this case is the least performing algorithm nse 0 933 mae 0 321 mm day rmse 0 399 mm day rae 35 4 while the forecasting capabilities of m5p nse 0 948 mae 0 271 mm day rmse 0 351 mm day rae 29 8 and bagging nse 0 949 mae 0 269 mm day rmse 0 347 mm day rae 29 7 are practically the same in addition m5p and bagging predictors are characterized by an appreciable increase of variance in the results for eta 3 mm day while svr shows a clear tendency to underestimate eta for values above 3 mm day m5p shows the highest residuals in the ranges 0 1 mm and 2 5 5 mm fig 9b as well as bagging fig 10b and svr fig 12b as regards rf fig 11b maximum residual values are comparable across the whole range of experimental measures therefore not including the sensible heat flux and the moisture content among the input variables has certain negative consequences on the effectiveness of the predicting model model 3 leads to results that are absolutely comparable with those of model 2 in some cases the results obtained by model 3 are even slightly better than those obtained by model 2 random forest nse 0 949 mae 0 267 mm day rmse 0 348 mm day rae 29 4 m5p nse 0 949 mae 0 27 mm day rmse 0 349 mm day rae 29 7 and bagging nse 0 949 mae 0 267 mm day rmse 0 347 mm day rae 29 4 show absolutely equivalent performance not even in this case an ensemble method can outperform a single regression tree svr is the least effective one in predicting actual evapotranspiration nse 0 932 mae 0 322 mm day rmse 0 400 mm day rae 35 4 m5p bagging and rf lead to highest residual values for eta 3 mm figs 13b 14 b 15 b while svr shows the highest errors in the ranges 0 1 mm and 3 6 mm in addition svr shows again a clear tendency to underestimate eta for values above 3 mm day a more effective representation of residuals for all models is provided by the notched box plots in fig 17 they represent the spread of errors with respect to the experimental values the lower end of each box plot represents the lower quartile q1 25th percentile the upper end represents the upper quartile q3 75th percentile the band inside the box represents the median of the data the whiskers extend from the bottom and top of the box to the smallest and highest non outlier in the dataset the blox plots confirm what previously stated on the different accuracy of the developed models the numerical details are shown in table 2 it is interesting to note that error distributions are characterized by greater symmetry for svr based models as expected finally a further comparison among the models can be shown by time series for the sake of conciseness and readability fig 18 shows the eta experimental values and predictions of the different models relating only to about two months from 29 july 2004 to 28 september 2004 once again it is possible to detect the greater accuracy of model 1 but also the very good forecasting capability of both model 2 and model 3 some relevant findings emerge from the results above shown the adopted machine learning algorithms are a powerful tool for the prediction of actual evapotranspiration when a time series of few years is available in particular starting from the measurements of a sufficient number of climatic parameters including the sensible heat flux and the soil moisture it is possible to obtain forecasting models characterized by very high accuracy and precision sensible heat flux as well as net solar radiation is a major component of the vertical energy balance at the surface on the other hand soil moisture dynamics are a central component of the hydrological cycle therefore a data driven model that takes into account the above two factors most likely leads to satisfactory results however in absence of experimental measurements of sensible heat flux and moisture content it is still possible to build a reliable forecasting model of eta with the aid of the machine learning algorithms based only on mean temperature net solar radiation and relative humidity data this last result is in agreement with the approach proposed by hargreaves according to which the evapotranspiration of reference in a given location depends essentially on the temperature on the extra terrestrial solar radiation and on appropriate coefficients to be calibrated according to local conditions hargreaves and samani 1982 these coefficients also take into account the relative humidity and the factors that lead from extra terrestrial solar radiation to the net solar radiation the advantage of the approach based on machine learning algorithms is that of directly providing effective evapotranspiration without the need to use crop coefficients moreover the presence of the wind speed among the input parameters does not bring appreciable advantages compared to its absence this result is in accordance with the penman monteith approach which suggests that in the absence of direct measurements of wind speed a constant value of 2 m s can be assumed the use of climatic data that are not very recent may appear to be a limitation of the study however projected temperature and precipitation trends in central florida appear to be quasi neutral with precipitation forecasts more uncertain lazarus 2009 these uncertainties are in part related to climate models and their inability to resolve aspects of the global circulation and internal oscillations however florida s recent climate does not seem to have undergone significant changes in either temperature or precipitation 4 conclusion an accurate prediction of actual evapotranspiration is essential for the estimation of irrigation needs and more generally for the careful management of water resources if experimental data are available machine learning algorithms represent a powerful tool able to provide accurate predictions in this study three different models were built to predict actual evapotranspiration at a central florida site with a humid subtropical climate four variants of each model were built varying the implemented machine learning algorithm m5p regression tree bagging random forest and support vector regression model 1 whose input variables are net solar radiation sensible heat flux moisture content of the soil wind speed mean relative humidity and mean temperature showed the best predictive capabilities all the implemented machine learning algorithms provided very good performances m5p proved to be the most accurate while rf was the least accurate model 2 whose input variables are net solar radiation wind speed mean relative humidity and mean temperature showed less effective forecasting capabilities than model 1 but still satisfactory unlike in the case of model 1 random forest provided best outcomes while svr was the least performing algorithm finally model 3 which also excludes wind speed from input variables led to results that are absolutely comparable with those of model 2 in this case random forest m5p and bagging show absolutely equivalent performance while svr is the least effective algorithm therefore it is definitely possible to build a reliable machine learning model for predicting actual evapotranspiration starting from mean temperature net solar radiation and relative humidity data the future developments of this study will concern the creation of more complex models based also on other machine learning algorithms e g ann elm that contemplate different climatic conditions and that subsequently take into account the effects of climate change if present

obtained in central florida at an experimental site whose vegetation mainly includes pastures of bahia grass 2 material and methods 2 1 algorithms support vector machines vapnik 1995 are supervised learning algorithms able to deal with classification or regression problems given a training dataset x1 y1 x2 y2 xl yl x r where x is the space of the input patterns e g x r n support vector regression svr pursues the goal of identifying a function f x as flat as possible and with a maximum ε deviation from the experimental target values yi fig 1 a hence given a linear function in the form 1 f x w x b in which w x b r and is the dot product in x the euclidean norm w 2 needs to be minimized leading to a constrained convex optimization problem however in many cases a certain error has to be accepted for that reason slack variables ξ ι ξ ι are introduced in the constraints and the optimization problem is formulated as 2 minimize 1 2 w 2 c i 1 l ξ i ξ i 3 subject to y i w x i b ε ξ i w x i b y i ε ξ i where the constant c 0 affects both the function flatness and the tolerated deviations the optimization problem may be properly solved in its dual formulation by means of lagrange multipliers the svr algorithm can be made nonlinear by preliminarily processing the training patterns x i by means of a function φ x f where f is some feature space the svr algorithm fig 1b is only depending on the dot products between the different patterns consequently it is possible to use a kernel k x i x j φ x i φ x j instead of explicitly employing the map φ the kernel functions commonly used in svr based models are linear polynomial radial basis function rbf and sigmoid which one produces the best results depends on the application in this study a rbf was selected as kernel it has the form 4 k x i x j exp γ x i x j 2 γ 0 preliminary tests have shown that the rbf leads to the best results in this specific problem rbf has advantages of good generalization and strong tolerance to input noise a regression tree rt model fig 2 employs a decision tree as predictive model breiman et al 1984 and the target variables take real values internal nodes denote the input variables whereas leaves correspond to given values of the target variables initially all training data is contained in a root node the development of a regression tree model involves the recursive subdivision of the input domain data into subdomains in each subdomain a multivariable linear regression model is used to make predictions the iterative algorithm initially allocates all data into two branches considering all the potential split on every field then the growth procedure of the regression tree is carried on by splitting each branch into smaller partitions as the system develops at each stage the process finds the subdivision in two separate partitions that minimizes the least squared deviation defined as 5 r t 1 n t i t y i y m t 2 where n t is the number of sample units in the node t yi is the value taken by the target variable in the i th unit and ym is the mean of the target variable in the node t this sum evaluates the impurity at each node indeed the split process at each node is conducted on the basis of the following function of r t 6 ϕ s p t r t p l r t l p r r t r in which tl and tr are the left and right nodes generated by the subdivision sp while pl and pr are the portions assigned in the left and right child node finally the split sp that maximizes the value of φ sp t is chosen the procedure is repeated until the lowest impurity level is attained or until a stopping rule is met a stopping rule may depend on the threshold for the minimum impurity variation provided by new splits the minimum amount of units in each node or the maximum tree complexity the algorithm implemented in this study is identified as m5p and arises from quinlan s m5 algorithm quinlan 1992 a fully developed regression tree model may undergo the problem of overfitting that occurs when a machine learning model has become too familiar with the data on which it was trained and therefore it is less effective if applied to any other dataset this risk is generally minimized by means of a pruning process it reduces the size of the regression tree model by removing the splits that do not improve significantly the predicting capability a combination of a number of learning models leads to an ensemble model the outputs of different regression tree models are combined into a single result generally using a weighted average bootstrap aggregating better known as bagging breiman 1996 is one of the most popular ensemble model fig 3 different training datasets having the same size are randomly chosen from the problem domain without replacement for each input dataset a regression tree model is built these trees will be different and will provide different predictions small alterations to the training data may lead to significant changes in ramifications and in forecasts for test instances bagging allows to obtain a combined model that may outperform the single tree model bagging attempts to counteract the instability of the process of regression tree growth by varying the original training dataset instead of sampling a novel training dataset each time some instances are removed and replaced by others at last the single predictions of the regression tree are averaged a set of uncorrelated simple regression trees breiman 2001 also allows to get a random forest one of the most effective ensemble algorithms each tree is developed starting from a different bootstrap sample of the data and each new training set is got with replacement from the original training set in addition random forests are different for the way regression trees are built in a standard tree each node is allocated referring to the best split among all variables during the process of development of a random forest instead at each node a small group of input variables to split on is randomly selected in the case of m input variables a number m m is identified such that at each node m variables are randomly chosen out of the m and the best split on these m is used to divide the node the value of m is kept constant during the growth of the forest each tree is expanded as far as possible no pruning process is carried out 2 2 study site data are provided by u s geological survey they were obtained during a study sumner and jacobs 2005 performed within a commercial farm located on a sand ridge near floral city florida usa fig 4 the farm is surrounded by wetlands a lake and residential areas the water table was approximately 6 9 m below land surface the area is characterized by a subtropical humid climate with a warm wet season lasting from june to september and a mild dry season lasting from october to may the average rainfall in the area is over 1300 mm per year the average annual air temperature is about 21 c in winter it rarely falls below 0 c while in summer it can exceed 35 c due to the evolution of cloud cover net solar radiation typically peaks about a month before the start of summer vegetation near the study site mainly includes pastures of bahia grass paspalum notatum flugge grass height averages about 8 12 cm in the area there are also agricultural fields of strawberries fragaria sp and brown top millet panicum ramosum the data were obtained by an eddy correlation station and ancillary sensors the eddy correlation technique also known as eddy covariance wilson et al 2001 is a key atmospheric measurement technique to evaluate vertical turbulent fluxes within atmospheric boundary layers it achieves turbulent flux data by computing the covariance of fluctuations in the vertical wind velocity and in the physical quantity to be evaluated the detailed characteristics of the measuring instruments can be found in sumner and jacobs 2005 the data used in the calculations were collected continuously between 28 september 2000 and 28 september 2004 3 results and discussion the effectiveness of forecasting models was assessed by means of four different criteria nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse and relative absolute error rae the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is a normalized statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the measured data variance nash and sutcliffe 1970 it is defined as 7 n s e 1 i 1 m y i f i 2 i 1 m y i y a 2 in which m is the experimental data total number fi is the model prediction for data point i yi is the experimental value for data point i ya is the average of the measured values nse is used to assess the predictive power of the model it can range from to 1 essentially the closer to 1 the more accurate the model is the mean absolute error evaluates the average magnitude of the errors in a set of forecasts without considering their sign it s the average over the test sample of the absolute differences between predicted and experimental values it is defined as 8 m a e i 1 m f i y i m rmse is the sample standard deviation of the differences between foreseen and actual values it is given by 9 r m s e i 1 m f i y i 2 m finally rae provides a normalized total absolute error according to the following definition 10 r a e i 1 m f i y i i 1 m y a y i the four adopted criteria are enough to fully characterize the efficiency of the models other evaluation metrics could be used median absolute percentage error mdape mean squared logarithmic error msle fourth root mean quadrupled error r4ms4e and some others dawson et al 2007 mdape is less sensitive to the larger errors occurring at high values r4ms4e is effective in evaluating model goodness of fit on peak and high values the msle due to the logarithmic transformations involved in its computation is a good measure for assessing model performances when predicting low values however preliminary tests have shown that different metrics do not alter the comparison so the use of the adopted more popular metrics was preferred based on the number of input variables three different models were obtained for the prediction of eta four variants of each model were built varying the implemented machine learning algorithm model 1 presents the following daily quantities as input variables net solar radiation sensible heat flux moisture content of the soil wind speed mean relative humidity and mean temperature model 2 is characterized instead by the following input variables net solar radiation wind speed mean relative humidity and mean temperature these variables are essentially the same as the penman monteith model finally model 3 admits as input variables the net solar radiation the mean relative humidity and the mean temperature model 3 is a simpler model than the others based only on the most important climatic variables for evapotranspiration estimation input variables can be measured with simple and inexpensive instruments practically everywhere so a similar model has the advantage of being able to be widely used on the other hand model 1 has the advantage of being quite complete with regard to the climatic input variables therefore it should be characterized by greater accuracy but it can only be used in areas where there are adequate measuring stations model 2 has a slightly larger complexity than model 3 and a slightly smaller applicability each model was developed through a k fold cross validation process using a set of 1360 vectors in k fold cross validation the original dataset is randomly partitioned into k subsets then a single subset is reserved as the validation data for testing the model while the remaining k 1 subsets are used as training data the cross validation process is repeated k times each of the k subsets is used once as the validation dataset finally the k results from the folds are averaged to provide a single estimation in this study k was chosen equal to 10 this value ensures satisfactory results table 1 and figs 5 16 show the effectiveness of the considered models in the evapotranspiration estimate model 1 shows the best predictive capabilities all implemented algorithms lead to very high values of nse table 1 greater than 0 98 in particular m5p is characterized by the highest value of nse and the lowest error values nse 0 987 mae 0 14 mm day rmse 0 179 mm day rae 15 4 the residual plot fig 5b shows that the highest errors occur in the range 0 2 mm the bagging algorithm although it provides remarkable results too is the least effective of the four showing the lowest value of nse equal to 0 98 and the highest error values mae 0 168 mm day rmse 0 219 mm day rae 18 5 also in this case the residual plot shows that the highest errors occur in the range 0 2 mm very similar performances are provided by random forest nse 0 981 mae 0 167 mm day rmse 0 218 mm day rae 18 5 which leads to the highest errors in the range 0 3 mm fig 6b svr which is characterized by nse 0 983 mae 0 153 mm day rmse 0 201 mm day and rae 16 9 shows better performance of both rf and bagging algorithms model 2 shows less effective forecasting capabilities than model 1 table 1 the values of nse are appreciably decreased while the errors are significantly increased however the results are still satisfactory unlike in the case of model 1 random forest provides best outcomes showing the highest value of nse equal to 0 951 and the lowest errors mae 0 267 mm day rmse 0 343 mm day rae 29 3 svr in this case is the least performing algorithm nse 0 933 mae 0 321 mm day rmse 0 399 mm day rae 35 4 while the forecasting capabilities of m5p nse 0 948 mae 0 271 mm day rmse 0 351 mm day rae 29 8 and bagging nse 0 949 mae 0 269 mm day rmse 0 347 mm day rae 29 7 are practically the same in addition m5p and bagging predictors are characterized by an appreciable increase of variance in the results for eta 3 mm day while svr shows a clear tendency to underestimate eta for values above 3 mm day m5p shows the highest residuals in the ranges 0 1 mm and 2 5 5 mm fig 9b as well as bagging fig 10b and svr fig 12b as regards rf fig 11b maximum residual values are comparable across the whole range of experimental measures therefore not including the sensible heat flux and the moisture content among the input variables has certain negative consequences on the effectiveness of the predicting model model 3 leads to results that are absolutely comparable with those of model 2 in some cases the results obtained by model 3 are even slightly better than those obtained by model 2 random forest nse 0 949 mae 0 267 mm day rmse 0 348 mm day rae 29 4 m5p nse 0 949 mae 0 27 mm day rmse 0 349 mm day rae 29 7 and bagging nse 0 949 mae 0 267 mm day rmse 0 347 mm day rae 29 4 show absolutely equivalent performance not even in this case an ensemble method can outperform a single regression tree svr is the least effective one in predicting actual evapotranspiration nse 0 932 mae 0 322 mm day rmse 0 400 mm day rae 35 4 m5p bagging and rf lead to highest residual values for eta 3 mm figs 13b 14 b 15 b while svr shows the highest errors in the ranges 0 1 mm and 3 6 mm in addition svr shows again a clear tendency to underestimate eta for values above 3 mm day a more effective representation of residuals for all models is provided by the notched box plots in fig 17 they represent the spread of errors with respect to the experimental values the lower end of each box plot represents the lower quartile q1 25th percentile the upper end represents the upper quartile q3 75th percentile the band inside the box represents the median of the data the whiskers extend from the bottom and top of the box to the smallest and highest non outlier in the dataset the blox plots confirm what previously stated on the different accuracy of the developed models the numerical details are shown in table 2 it is interesting to note that error distributions are characterized by greater symmetry for svr based models as expected finally a further comparison among the models can be shown by time series for the sake of conciseness and readability fig 18 shows the eta experimental values and predictions of the different models relating only to about two months from 29 july 2004 to 28 september 2004 once again it is possible to detect the greater accuracy of model 1 but also the very good forecasting capability of both model 2 and model 3 some relevant findings emerge from the results above shown the adopted machine learning algorithms are a powerful tool for the prediction of actual evapotranspiration when a time series of few years is available in particular starting from the measurements of a sufficient number of climatic parameters including the sensible heat flux and the soil moisture it is possible to obtain forecasting models characterized by very high accuracy and precision sensible heat flux as well as net solar radiation is a major component of the vertical energy balance at the surface on the other hand soil moisture dynamics are a central component of the hydrological cycle therefore a data driven model that takes into account the above two factors most likely leads to satisfactory results however in absence of experimental measurements of sensible heat flux and moisture content it is still possible to build a reliable forecasting model of eta with the aid of the machine learning algorithms based only on mean temperature net solar radiation and relative humidity data this last result is in agreement with the approach proposed by hargreaves according to which the evapotranspiration of reference in a given location depends essentially on the temperature on the extra terrestrial solar radiation and on appropriate coefficients to be calibrated according to local conditions hargreaves and samani 1982 these coefficients also take into account the relative humidity and the factors that lead from extra terrestrial solar radiation to the net solar radiation the advantage of the approach based on machine learning algorithms is that of directly providing effective evapotranspiration without the need to use crop coefficients moreover the presence of the wind speed among the input parameters does not bring appreciable advantages compared to its absence this result is in accordance with the penman monteith approach which suggests that in the absence of direct measurements of wind speed a constant value of 2 m s can be assumed the use of climatic data that are not very recent may appear to be a limitation of the study however projected temperature and precipitation trends in central florida appear to be quasi neutral with precipitation forecasts more uncertain lazarus 2009 these uncertainties are in part related to climate models and their inability to resolve aspects of the global circulation and internal oscillations however florida s recent climate does not seem to have undergone significant changes in either temperature or precipitation 4 conclusion an accurate prediction of actual evapotranspiration is essential for the estimation of irrigation needs and more generally for the careful management of water resources if experimental data are available machine learning algorithms represent a powerful tool able to provide accurate predictions in this study three different models were built to predict actual evapotranspiration at a central florida site with a humid subtropical climate four variants of each model were built varying the implemented machine learning algorithm m5p regression tree bagging random forest and support vector regression model 1 whose input variables are net solar radiation sensible heat flux moisture content of the soil wind speed mean relative humidity and mean temperature showed the best predictive capabilities all the implemented machine learning algorithms provided very good performances m5p proved to be the most accurate while rf was the least accurate model 2 whose input variables are net solar radiation wind speed mean relative humidity and mean temperature showed less effective forecasting capabilities than model 1 but still satisfactory unlike in the case of model 1 random forest provided best outcomes while svr was the least performing algorithm finally model 3 which also excludes wind speed from input variables led to results that are absolutely comparable with those of model 2 in this case random forest m5p and bagging show absolutely equivalent performance while svr is the least effective algorithm therefore it is definitely possible to build a reliable machine learning model for predicting actual evapotranspiration starting from mean temperature net solar radiation and relative humidity data the future developments of this study will concern the creation of more complex models based also on other machine learning algorithms e g ann elm that contemplate different climatic conditions and that subsequently take into account the effects of climate change if present

soil fertility and low soil moisture content in the tropical sub humid regions experiencing erratic rainfall keywords rain fed agriculture erratic rainfall organic inputs soil moisture content 1 introduction limited investment in soil nutrient replenishing inputs continuous land tillage and low and erratic rainfall are major causes of declining agricultural productivity in most countries of sub saharan africa ssa rusinamhodzi et al 2011 thierfelder et al 2013 tesfahunegn 2015 kiboi et al 2017 this is partly caused by continuous nutrient mining through crop harvesting and nutrient losses through runoff and erosion without commensurate replenishment through external soil fertility enhancing inputs application vanlauwe and giller 2006 bationo et al 2007 mucheru muna et al 2014 the effects of declining soil fertility are further exacerbated by the use of conventional tillage methods as most smallholder farmers believe that soil tillage is needed to maximise crop yield johansen et al 2012 also rain fed agriculture dominates the bulk of the arable land in ssa under smallholder farming system mupangwa et al 2012 besides the undesirable effect of tillage and low soil fertility in rain fed farming systems soil moisture is generally limited and crop growth is almost always stressed by drought during the growing season resulting in decreased and unsustainable crop yields ngetich et al 2014 hence there is a need for the assessment of the use of readily available organic inputs combined with different tillage methods for maximising soil water content and increasing crop production under the rainfed farming system several researchers have advocated soil fertility management through utilisation of organic resources solely or in combination with mineral fertiliser for increased crop yields mtambanengwe et al 2006 mucheru muna et al 2007 tueche and hauser 2011 herrmann et al 2014 pincus et al 2016 this is because most smallholder farmers use little or no inorganic fertilisers as they are expensive and unaffordable and sometimes not readily available when needed ayuke et al 2007 mugwe et al 2009 fermont et al 2010 for example farmers in the central highlands of kenya areas are harvesting maize yields below 1 0 mg ha 1 against a potential of 6 to 8 mg ha 1 partially due to declined soil moisture kiboi et al 2017 unbalanced nutrient mining and limited or none use of soil fertility restoring sources mucheru muna et al 2014 organic resources play essential roles in soil fertility management over inorganic fertiliser in sustainability terms they can supply plant nutrients and improve nutrient use efficiency contribute to long term soil organic matter som formation and maintenance and augmentation of soil physical properties palm et al 2001 lazcano et al 2013 combination of organic and inorganic resources has also been suggested as one of the effective ways of addressing soil fertility decline in farming systems with the low capacity to apply sufficient quantities of inorganic soil nutrients chivenge et al 2011a increased crop yield under sole organic inputs or combination of organic inputs and mineral fertilisers in ssa is widely reported teklay et al 2006 hepperly et al 2009 shisanya et al 2009 li et al 2010 pypers et al 2011 ibrahim et al 2015 hence the integration of organic and inorganic resources can have a positive impact on the soil quality and crop yields on smallholder farmers fields zingore et al 2007 besides nutrient additions through organic and inorganic sources different cropping intensification approaches like maize legume integration can aid in the maintenance of soil productivity improvement through soil nitrogen fixation and enhancement of som build up in the soil wortmann et al 2000 woomer et al 2003 however only a few farmers use mineral fertilisers and hardly use the recommended rates mugwe et al 2009 leading to partial soil nutrient replenishment and low yields although organic inputs are locally available in most smallholder farms most farmers seldom utilise them and mostly prefer to use mineral fertilisers which they rarely can afford in sufficient amounts in the central highlands of kenya soil fertility has been declining over time due to continuous cultivation with minimal soil nutrient replenishment in the quest to meet the food demands of the increasing population mucheru muna et al 2014 continuous cultivation which employs conventional continuous tillage method can alter soil physicochemical properties and crop performance conventional tillage alters the distribution of chemical properties in the soil profile and affects the physical and biochemical properties in the surface layer wyngaard et al 2012 it also leads to a decline in soil aggregate stability paul et al 2013 soil organic carbon soil water retention capacity martínez et al 2013 increases evaporation losses and heightens soils susceptibility to runoff generation ngetich et al 2014 resulting in decreased yields on the other hand according to luo et al 2010 minimum tillage can change the distribution of soil carbon in the soil profile concentrating it in the topsoil it can also foster som protection from hastened decomposition which can lead to the restoration of soil biological processes sanginga and woomer 2009 thus the potential of minimum tillage to increase crop yields can be attributed to its potential to improve water retention and consequently increase fertiliser responsiveness grabowski et al 2014 tillage systems that can enhance crop productivity under smallholder farming systems are therefore desirable erratic rainfall often obscures the responsiveness of crops to soil fertility management strategies aimed at increasing crop productivity in the study area crop production in the smallholder farming system is majorly rain fed the central highlands of kenya have been experiencing low and erratic rainfall with high occurrences of dry spells and drought jaetzold et al 2007 ngetich et al 2014 resulting in decreased and unstable yields kiboi et al 2017 crop residue retention increases water infiltration protects against soil erosion and enhance crop growth and development and can lead to increased grain yield and water use efficiency tao et al 2015 minimum tillage on the other hand can increase the capillary porosity as a result it enhances the water capacity of soil sharma and abrol 2005 application of organic inputs improves som which enhances soil water retention given that tillage systems and crop residue retention can influence soil water content and water use efficiency balwinder singh et al 2011 ma et al 2015 their judicious application in farming systems have the potential to pacify the effects of erratic rainfall patterns on crop performance to enhance crop performance and increase production emphasis should be placed on strengthening rain fed farming through effective soil management and tillage systems plants require a supply of sufficient nutrients and enough moisture for optimal productivity this can be achieved through the utilisation of assorted soil nutrients enhancing approaches such as animal manure biomass transfer cereal legume intercropping and crop residue retention the problem of unbalanced fertilisation is exacerbated by the limited range of fertiliser blends that are available and the prices thus inappropriate nutrient combinations are used particularly on food crops to enhance maize crop performance increase yields and improve soil water content effective tillage system and soil fertility management strategies are required we therefore set to determine the effects of minimum and conventional tillage systems and soil fertility inputs on maize crop performance and soil water content 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was carried out at chuka in tharaka nithi county and kandara in murang a county kenya fig 1 the rainfall pattern is bimodal in the two counties long rain season lr lasting from march to june and short rain season sr from late october to december jaetzold et al 2007 tharaka nithi county receives a total annual rainfall of 1200 to 1400 mm and an annual mean temperature of 20 c the predominant soil type is humic nitisols a typically deep and weathered soil with moderate to high inherent fertility jaetzold et al 2007 murang a county receives total annual rainfall of 900 to 1400 mm and a mean annual temperature of 21 3 c jaetzold et al 2007 the predominant soil type in the county is nitisols which are well drained extremely deep dusky red to dark reddish brown friable clay with acidic humic topsoil and moderate to high fertility maize is the dominant annual crop in the two counties the primary land use activities are subsistence farming livestock rearing cash crop farming and agroforestry the primary farming system in the area is mixed farming 2 2 experimental layout treatments and management a uniformity experiment was conducted during short rain season of 2015 sr15 in each site after which blocking was done based on crop performance we designed and established the experimental plots in chuka and kandara sites during long rains 2016 lr16 season the experimental design was a split plot arranged in a randomised complete block design the experiment was conducted for four cropping seasons long rains 2016 lr16 short rains 2016 sr16 long rains 2017 lr17 and short rains 2017 sr17 tillage was the main treatment while soil fertility inputs were the sub treatments the treatments table 1 were replicated four times at each site being the dominant annual crop in the two counties maize zea mays l variety h516 was the test crop the plot sizes were 6 m by 4 5 m and 4 5 m by 4 5 m in chuka and kandara respectively land preparation under conventional tillage d15 plots was done using a hand hoe to 15 cm depth while in minimum tillage d0 plots only planting holes were ploughed planting was done at inter and intra row spacing of 0 75 m by 0 5 m respectively in both sites three seeds were planted per hill to ensure maximum plant population two weeks after germination the excess plant was thinned out to remain with two plants per hill hence a population density of 53 333 plants ha 1 soil fertility inputs were applied to give an equivalent amount of 60 kg n ha 1 to meet maize nutrient requirements in the two study areas fertilizer use recommendation project furp 1987 phosphorus was applied as triple super phosphate tsp in treatments with sole mineral fertiliser and mineral fertiliser combination during planting at the rate of 90 kg p ha 1 the organic inputs animal manure and tithonia diversifolia were incorporated in the soil two weeks to the onset of the season in the d15 plots while in d0 plots they were incorporated only in the planting holes animal manure was obtained from local farms mixed thoroughly and dried under shade for at least two months tithonia diversifolia was harvested from nearby biomass transfer ridges weighed chopped into small pieces and incorporated in the soil a sample of each organic input was taken and n content determined animal manure had 2 1 of n while tithonia diversifolia had 3 8 from the n content results the amount of organics to be applied equivalent to 30 or 60 kg n ha 1 was calculated for the treatments with sole organics an equivalent of 60 kg n ha 1 was applied and for the treatments with combination an equivalent of 30 kg n ha 1 for each input was applied after thinning maize crop residue was uniformly 5 mg ha 1 surface applied in five treatments under each tillage system as shown in table 1 in d15 plots weeding was done thrice in a season using a hand hoe while under d0 it was by hand pulling stem borers were controlled by preventive application of tremor gr 0 05 a granule formulated synthetic pyrethroid insecticide with beta cyfluthrin being the active ingredient pesticide 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 crop growth indices four adjacent plants on the middle row per plot were sampled non destructive sampling during the 6th leaf stage ritchie et al 1997 and 10th leaf stage to determine the maize crop growth indices soil plant analysis development spad meter was used to measure the greenness or the relative chlorophyll concentration of maize leaves netto et al 2005 the relative maize leaf chlorophyll content chl measurements were taken from the 6th and 10th leaf counted from the base of the plant using a soil plant analysis development spad 502plus meter konica minolta optics inc japan three readings were recorded from the left and right sides and middle of the leaf and the mean recorded plant height was measured using a ruler as the distance from the base of the plant to the uppermost extended leaf tip 2 3 2 maize grain and stover yields maize grain was harvested at maturity from a net area of 21 m2 in chuka and 15 m2 in kandara after leaving out guard rows and the first and last maize plants in each row to minimise the edge effect the cobs in each plot were separated from the stover and fresh weight determined the cobs were then air dried separated from the grains through hand shelling weighed and grains moisture content determined the moisture content was determined using the dickey john minigac moisture meter the grain weight was corrected based on the measured moisture content determined to 12 5 equivalence and converted to per hectare basis stover weight was determined at harvest and samples taken weighted and further dried under shade until constant weight the ultimate weight of the dry stover was used to correct for moisture content of the stover weight and derivation of the per hectare stover yield 2 3 3 rainfall amount and soil water content daily rainfall measurement was obtained from a manual rain gauge installed at the sites at a distance of about 20 m from the experimental plots in the middle of each plot a pvc access tube was installed for soil water content measurement soil water content was measured weekly at 0 50 cm depth in each plot using diviner2000 version 1 5 190 capacitance sensor sentek sensor technologies stepney south australia the measurements were taken at regular intervals of 10 cm the diviner was gravimetrically calibrated using extra installed access tubes installed in adjacent plots next to the experimental plots with the same soil type the pvc access tubes were installed shortly after planting during the lr16 season thus measurements were not done immediately to allow the pvc tubes to equilibrate in the soil also during the lr17 season soil water content was not measured because the probe was damaged 2 4 data analyses the data were subjected to analysis of variance anova using the mixed procedure model in sas 9 3 software sas institute 2011 to obtain an f value of the model effect for treatments means comparison tukey s honestly significant difference test was used at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall amount and distribution differences in total rainfall amount and distribution between the cropping seasons were observed at each site fig 2 cumulatively rainfall received in chuka during the trials period was 2321 mm whereby 879 mm was received during lr16 385 mm during sr16 341 mm during lr17 571 mm during sr17 and 145 mm during off season periods fig 2a in kandara cumulative rainfall received during the trials period was 1197 mm with 329 mm received during lr16 243 mm during sr16 206 mm during lr17 419 mm during sr17 and 95 mm received during off seasons fig 2b both sites experienced a meteorological drought defined as the absence of rainfall for a period above twenty eight days during the growing season and dry spells absence of rainfall in periods ranging between 10 28 days during crop growing season during the experiment period rockström et al 2002 okeyo et al 2014 kiboi et al 2017 chuka site experienced a meteorological drought of 33 days and dry spells of 16 and 13 days while kandara site had a meteorological drought of 31 days and dry spells of 18 10 and 24 days during the lr16 season fig 2 at the beginning of the sr16 season a dry spell of 10 days was experienced in chuka and a meteorological drought of 31 days towards the end of the season fig 2 in kandara there were dry spells of 17 and 14 days at the onset of the sr16 season and a meteorological drought of 36 days at the end of the season during lr17 season there was a dry spell of 21 days at the beginning of the season and a meteorological drought of 31 days towards the end of the season in chuka during the same season in kandara there were dry spells of 17 10 and 16 days and a meteorological drought of 31 days at the end of the season in the sr17 season chuka experienced dry spells of 17 15 and 27 days while kandara had two dry spells of 10 days each and a meteorological drought of 43 days as earlier observed by mucheru muna et al 2014 in a study conducted in meru south tharaka nithi county dry spells mostly occurred during the peak periods of crop water requirement the differences in rainfall amounts beginning and end days and number of months the rain was received between long rains seasons and short rains seasons within each site indicated the distinction between the two cropping seasons annually we observed variation in rainfall amounts and distribution between seasons and frequent dry spells this was consistent with the findings of mucheru muna et al 2014 additionally rockström et al 2010 reported that sub humid agro ecosystems e g the study area experience high frequency of droughts and dry spells start days and the end of a rainy season and thus its length plus rainfall amounts and risk of dry spells within the season are essential aspects for crop growth because they strongly affect crop growth and productivity ngetich et al 2014 3 2 crop growth indices 3 2 1 relative leaf chlorophyll content spad values tillage and the interactions tillage soil fertility inputs had no significant effect on the relative leaf chlorophyll chl content during the trials period at the sixth and tenth leaf stage in chuka and kandara table 2 conversely chl content was significantly p 0001 affected by soil fertility inputs sfis during the 6th and 10th leaf stage table 2 throughout the trials period in both sites application of mineral fertiliser f showed the highest chl content during sixth leaf stage in all seasons in both sites except during lr17 season in chuka at the 6th leaf stage chl content was significantly p 0001 higher under f rf rfm rtim rtip and rml by 66 60 58

37 and 30 compared with the control chlorophyll content was also significantly higher under rf f rfm and rtim by 24 21 18 and 9 respectively compared with the control during the lr17 season in chuka in kandara chl content was significantly p 0001 higher under f rf rfm and rtim by 48 47 40 and 20 respectively compared with the control during the lr16 season similar to chuka chl content was significantly higher in sfis with mineral fertiliser f rfm and rf by 12 11 and 11 compared with the control during the sr16 season in kandara moreover during lr17 season chl content was significantly high under sfis with mineral fertiliser f and rf by 37 and rfm by 30 compared with the control in kandara during the sr17 season chl content was only measured in chuka and was significantly high under f rf rfm and rtim by 52 35 30 and 18 compared with the control during the 10th leaf stage chl content was significantly p 0001 higher under rfm and rf by 38 rtip rtim f and rml by 34 32 26 and 11 compared with the control during the lr16 season in chuka table 2 chlorophyll content was significantly higher under sfis with mineral fertiliser rf f and rfm by 42 36 and 32 during the sr16 and lr17 f rf and rfm by 38 37 and 29 seasons compared with the control during the sr17 season chl content under rfm f rf rml and rtim was significantly greater by 55 50 48 34 and 26 compared with the control in chuka in kandara chl content was significantly higher under rfm f and rf by 57 44 and 37 compared to the control during the lr16 season table 2 compared with the control chl content significantly increased under f rf and rfm treatments by 28 27 and 23 during the sr16 and under rf f and rfm by 14 12 and 11 in lr17 seasons in kandara on average sole mineral fertilization led to the highest chl content followed by combination with organic inputs at the 6th and 10th leaf stage in all seasons compared with the control at both sites table 3 application of sfis significantly influenced maize leaf chl content at the two study sites this corroborated with the results of bayoumi and hafez 2006 who found that different organic and mineral fertiliser treatments significantly influenced chl content spad green colour reading on cucumber it was observed that sole mineral fertiliser led to the highest chl content during the sixth leaf stage in all seasons in both sites table 3 other studies have also reported a significant increase in chl content with the addition of n fertiliser jing et al 2010 subaedah et al 2016 high chlorophyll content observed under the combination of mineral fertiliser with crop residues rf and rfm was attributed to the readily available nitrogen from the mineral fertiliser npk addition of n fertiliser enhances decomposition of organic resources and n release okalebo et al 2006 chlorophyll concentration or leaf greenness is significantly affected by n status of the plant adamtey et al 2010 mansouri far et al 2010 abbasi et al 2013 a study by hauggaard nielsen et al 2013 reported that fertiliser treatments significantly p 0 0001 influenced maize chl content compared with the green manure and control treatments the significant increase in chl content under the combination of organics and mineral fertiliser was also reported by mohammadi et al 2013 under application of farmyard manure compost and mineral fertiliser as also observed in our study under rfm and rtip the significant increase in chl content under rtim could be ascribed to the fast decomposition rates of tithonia diversifolia hence readily available n for plant uptake while under rml could be the n from the legume crop this corroborates with findings of bilalis et al 2009 who observed a significant increase in chlorophyll content spad values of tobacco leaves under green manure application compared to the control the consistence was likely due to the similar soil texture of clay the soils in their site as reported in our study site by kiboi et al 2018 on the contrary liu and wiatrak 2011 and széles et al 2012 reported no significant change in maize leaf chl content as a result of n doses under rain fed conditions at the 6th leaf growth stage however they observed higher chl content under treatments with higher amounts of n 120 kg ha 1 the inconsistence could be due to differences in weather conditions whereby the two studies were carried out in dryland conditions whereas our study was in the sub humid areas the lowest chl contents were observed in the control treatment during all the measurement stages as also reported in a study by széles et al 2012 this is because there was no inputs n fertilization addition in the treatment 3 2 2 maize plant height tillage significantly p 0 04 influenced maize height at the sixth leaf stage during the lr16 season in kandara site only fig 3 b soil fertility inputs sfis significantly influenced maize height at the 6th and 10th leaf stage throughout the trials period in chuka fig 3a in kandara

sr17 season in chuka fig 4 a and the lr17 season in kandara fig 4b soil fertility inputs significantly influenced maize height at the 10th leaf stage throughout the trials period in chuka during the lr16 season maize height significantly p 0 02 increased under rtim rfm rf rtip and f by 38 37 36 33 and 24 compared with the control in chuka fig 4a during the sr16 season maize height significantly p

significantly influenced plant height during lr16 lr17 and sr17 season at the 10th leaf stage maize height significantly p 0001 increased under f rf rfm rtip and rtim by 47 45 44 24 and 18 compared with the control at the 10th leaf stage during the lr16 season fig 4b during the sr16 season the treatments had no significant influence on the maize height during 10th leaf stage in kandara on the other hand maize height was significantly p 0 003 influenced under tillage during the lr17 season in kandara whereby d15 performed better than d0 soil fertility inputs rfm rf rtip f and rtim significantly increased maize height at the 10th leaf stage by 16 9 9 7 and 7 compared with the control in kandara during the lr17 season during sr17 season plant height significantly increased under rfm f rtip and rf by 11 10 8 and 8 compared with the control in kandara maize plant height during the two sampling stages was highest during the lr16 season on average application of sole mineral fertiliser led to the highest plant height at the 6th leaf stage followed by the combination of fertiliser and organic inputs compared with the control during the trials period in chuka table 4 at the 10th leaf stage maize height was highest under fert org followed by use of fert compared with the control throughout the trial period except during the sr16 season in kandara on average plant height was significantly p 0001 influenced by soil fertility inputs at the sixth leaf stage only during the lr17 season table 4 at the 10th leaf stage on average maize height was significantly high under fert and fert org by 45 and 34 respectively compared with the control during the lr16 season combination of mineral fertiliser and organic inputs led to the highest maize height compared with the control during the lr17 and sr17 seasons in kandara plant height is one of the maize growth parameter that is affected by n availability yin et al 2011 mokhtassi bidgoli et al 2013 and essential in determining yield grains machado et al 2002 freeman et al 2007 fertilization can impact crop growth parameters such as plant height boomsma et al 2010 soil fertility inputs with mineral fertiliser f rf rfm rtip consistently led to greater plant height which was attributed to the readily available n various studies have reported a significant increase in maize plant height with mineral fertiliser application makinde 2007 yin et al 2011 several authors have also reported an increase in plant height of various crops as a result of fertiliser application for instance wu jun et al 2014 observed a significant increase in rice oryza sativa plant height in china while ehsanipour et al 2012 observed in fennel foeniculum vulgare mill combination of organic inputs and mineral fertiliser rtip showed an increase in plant height in both sites tabu et al 2007 also reported an increase in plant height under treatments with tithonia diversifolia and phosphate rock by 53 and 39 respectively application of sole organic inputs rtim rml also showed an increase in plant height in both sites the significant increase in maize height under rtim could be ascribed to the fast decomposition rates of tithonia diversifolia while under rml could be as a result of n from the legume drakopoulos et al 2016 also reported increased plant height in treatments using organic resources such as lucerne pellets under tillage d15 had higher plant height compared with d0 during the lr16 season at the 6th leaf stage at chuka and sr17 season at the 10th stage and during the lr17 season in kandara at the 10th leaf stage this could be due to restriction in roots development at the early stages of crop growth under minimum tillage low maize and wheat plant height in minimum or no till treatments have also been reported by several researchers babalola and opara nadi 1993 atreya et al 2008 adekalu et al 2009 oicha et al 2010 however other researchers have reported increased plant height under minimum tillage compared to conventional tillage lafond et al 2006 araya et al 2012 the highest maize plant height observed during the lr16 season was ascribed to the high rainfall amounts received during the season fig 2 leading to improved soil fertility inputs decomposition enhancing increased inorganic n uptake by the plants 3 3 maize grain and stover yields tillage had significantly p 007 higher maize grain yields by 12 compared to minimum tillage during the lr17 season in chuka in kandara grain yields were significantly p 0 01 high under minimum tillage by 22 compared with tillage during sr17 season table 5 soil fertility inputs significantly influenced grain yields during the trials period in both study sites grain yields significantly p 0001 increased under rfm rtim rtip rf and f by 120 103 94 93 40 compared with the control during the lr16 season in chuka table 5 during the sr16 season a decrease in grain yields was observed in chuka nevertheless they were significantly p 0001 higher under rfm rf f rtim and rtip compared with the control during the lr17 season grain yields significantly p 0001 increased under rfm rf f rtim and rtip by 131 114 72 67 and 35 compared with the control in chuka table 5 in kandara grain yields significantly p 0001 increased under rfm f rf rtim and rtip by 97 61 56 30 and 23 compared with the control during the lr16 season similar to chuka site grain yields decreased in kandara during the sr16 season all the same the yields were significantly p 0001 higher under f rfm rtim and rf by 165 137 134 117 and 58 compared with the control no grain yields were harvested in kandara during the lr17 season table 5 in both sites grain yields were not significantly different under rml compared with the control throughout the trial period also the interactions had no significant influence on grain yields for the four cropping seasons in the two study sites table 5 tillage significantly influenced maize stover yields during the lr16 p 0001 and sr16 p 0 0009 seasons in chuka site table 6 soil fertility inputs significantly influenced stover yields during the trial period in chuka during lr16 season stover yields significantly increased under rfm rf rtim rtip f and rml by 205 150 145 123 113 and 88 compared with the control in the sr16 season stover yields in chuka were significantly higher under rf rfm f rtip and rtim by 200 179 176 85 and 62 compared with the control during the lr17 season stover yields significantly increased under rfm rf rtim f and rtip by 71 65 38 38 and 18 compared with the control in kandara tillage had no significant influence on stover yields throughout the tested cropping seasons compared with the control stover yields significantly p 0 05 increased under rf rfm f and rtip by 141 98 89 and 84 respectively during the lr16 season in kandara table 6 during the sr16 season stover yields were significantly higher under rtim by 61 while in the lr17 season the yields increased under rfm rf rtim and rtip by 52 52 50 and 23 respectively compared with the control stover yields were not significantly different between rml and the control treatment during sr16 and lr17 seasons in chuka and during lr16 and sr16 seasons in kandara on average grain yields were highest under the combination of fertiliser and organic inputs followed by use of sole mineral fertiliser compared with the control during the lr16 lr17 and sr17 seasons in chuka table 7 in kandara grain yields were highest under fert org compared with the control during the lr16 season during the sr16 and sr17 seasons the yields were highest under application of fertiliser only table 7 on average stover yields in chuka were highest under fert compared with the control during the trial period except in the lr16 season table 7 in kandara use of sole fertiliser led to the highest stover yields during the lr16 and sr17 seasons while fert org had the highest yields during sr16 and lr17 seasons table 7 the high grain yields under d15 in chuka during lr17 season were attributed to the quicker supply of nutrients due to tillage before meteorological drought towards the end of the season conventional tillage fastens decomposition of inputs hence quick supply of nutrients earlier in the rainfall events dikgwatlhe et al 2014 increased yields under d0 in kandara during sr16 season was ascribed to the ability of reduced tillage to conserve soil water minimum tillage enhances soil water retention and fertilizer responsiveness compared with conventional tillage grabowski et al 2014 except for rml application of soil fertility inputs rfm rtip f rf and rtim significantly increased maize yields our results were consistent with that of a meta analysis done by chivenge et al 2011b and a study conducted by mucheru muna et al 2014 in central kenya the increased maize yields under the combination of organics and mineral fertiliser treatments rfm rtip could be ascribed to increased fertiliser use efficiency due to the balanced supply of nutrients for the crop application of organics may cause initial immobilisation of n but a combination with n fertilisers may result in improved synchrony between supply and demand of nutrients partey et al 2013 this results in enhanced use efficiency of the two resources resulting in positive interactive effects on crop yield chivenge et al 2011b the organics also enhance build up and maintenance of soil organic matter and improved soil moisture retention gentile et al 2008 rurinda et al 2013 leading to increased yields furthermore a combination of n fertilisers with low quality organic inputs in clayey soils enhances decomposition chivenge et al 2011a in their meta analysis chivenge et al 2011b also reported that the combined application of organics and n fertilisers more than doubled maize yields 114 compared to the no input control a study conducted for three years by zhang et al 2016 showed significant increase in maize yields in combination of compost npk and wheat straw compared with the control additionally a significant increase in maize yield under a combination of mineral fertiliser and or manure or maize residues compared to the control have been reported in numerous studies mtambanengwe et al 2006 gentile et al 2009 mugwe et al 2009 increased maize yields under crop residue retention and mineral fertiliser rf application were also recorded by anyanzwa et al 2010 increased maize yields under sole organic inputs rtim were also observed during the trials period in both sites organic resources usually release soil nutrients gradually and supply the crop throughout the growing period adediran et al 2005 several studies have reported a significant increase in yields as a result of sole organic inputs application for instance following the application of sole tithonia diversifolia biomass mucheru muna et al 2007 reported an increase of up to 267 in central kenya jama et al 2000 reported a yield increase of up to 200 in western kenya while mtambanengwe et al 2006 reported an increase of 525 following manure application in zimbabwe however application of rml had no significant effect on maize yield compared with the control throughout the trial period which could be due to high nutrient competition from the legumes the slow release of nutrients from manure and n immobilisation from the crop residue retention animal manure and maize crop residues are classified to be poor in supplying short term plant available n palm et al 2001 ngwira et al 2012 observed a reduction in maize yields when intercropped with lablab a study conducted in the central highlands of kenya also reported lower maize yields in treatments with herbaceous legumes compared to the control as a result of nutrient competition shisanya et al 2009 nyamangara et al 2013 also observed grain yield decline of 28 48 in residue retention and or legume based crop rotation compared to the control the differences in grain and stover yield among the various soil fertility inputs could have been as a result of differences in input quality their decomposition rates and rainfall amount decomposition of organic inputs is highly sensitive to soil moisture and clay content of the soil chivenge et al 2011a turmel et al 2015 tian et al 2007 observed increased decomposition rate and nutrient release with high quality organic input in wetter climates than in drier climates during the trial period there were frequent dry spells which could have inhibited the decomposition of the organic inputs the percentage increases in maize yield in our study were lower compared to other studies jama et al 2000 mucheru muna et al 2007 2014 which we attributed to low soil moisture as a result of the continuous decline in rainfall amount during the trial period for instance both study sites experienced a considerable decline in grain yields during the sr16 season due to decline in rainfall amounts fig 2 besides no maize grains were harvested in kandara during the lr17 season enfors et al 2011 reported substantial differences in grain yield and biomass between the seasons to be as a result of variable rainfall tillage had no significant effect on maize grain yields which is ascribed to the short period the trials were conducted and rainfall variation between cropping seasons conventional tillage is widely reported to result in low yields kiboi et al 2017 and conversion to minimum tillage would require a longer period to increase yields significantly after eight cropping seasons paul et al 2013 observed that tillage alone did not have a significant effect on maize yields and high annual variation in crop yields due to rainfall variation weakened the significance of tillage effects still in a study conducted for eight cropping seasons in malawi by thierfelder et al 2013 reported no significant difference in maize yields between conventional tillage and no tillage moreover after twelve years of experimentation maltas et al 2013 observed that reduced tillage had no significant effect on maize grain and aboveground biomass yields 3 4 soil water content total soil water content swc at 0 50 cm depth was significantly affected by soil fertility inputs in both sites during the two tested seasons sr16 and sr17 tables 8 and 10 the moisture content of the soil profile closely followed the seasonal rainfall pattern at both sites figs 5 and 6 both tillage and the interactions had no significant influence on swc at 0 50 cm depth in both sites table 8 at the vegetative phase swc was significantly higher under rtim and rml by 10 and 6 on date 8 12 2016 9 and 6 15 12 2016 and 8 and 7 30 12 2016 respectively compared with the control in chuka during the sr16 season table 8 and fig 5a during the grain formation and filling phase swc was significantly p 0 05 affected under rtim and rml during the measured days in chuka fig 5a and table 8 in kandara soil fertility inputs had no significant influence on swc in the vegetative grain formation and filling phases during the sr16 season fig 5b and table 8 however we observed a trend of the swc increasing under soil fertility inputs with sole organic inputs generally soil moisture declined during grain formation and filling phase in both sites during the sr17 season soil fertility inputs significantly influenced swc throughout the vegetative phase in chuka site table 9 and fig 6 still rtim and rml showed the highest swc compared with the control with the effect being highest when the rains decreased on date 18 11 2017 by 11 and 8 respectively in the grain formation and filling phase swc was significantly influenced by the soil fertility inputs except on date 30 12 2017 the increase was highest at the end of the phase 13 012 2018 by 12 and 10 under rtim and rml respectively compared with the control at kandara site swc was significantly influenced by the sfis at the start of the vegetative phase in the sr17 season table 9 and fig 6b at the start 03 11 2017 of the vegetative phase swc was significantly higher under rml and rfm by 3 compared with the control in the following dates i e 10 17 24 november 2017 and 01 12 2017 swc was significantly high only under rml compared with the control table 9 the significant influence in soil water content was observed during grain formation and filling stage in both sites when rainfall amounts decreased the pattern of fluctuation of the swc during the vegetative grain formation and filling phases remained similar during the two cropping seasons soil moisture influences crop growth not only by affecting nutrient availability but also nutrient transformations and soil biological behaviour soil moisture deficit that occurs during critical crop growth phases for example during flowering and grain formation and filling phases of maize can cause substantial yield reductions or even occasionally total harvest failure sime et al 2015 we observed severe yield decline during the sr16 season in both sites and grain yields failure in kandara during the lr17 season table 5 in a study conducted in central kenya mucheru muna et al 2014 observed that drought spells frequently occurred during the peak crop water requirement periods flowering and tussling poor rainfall distribution and low amounts are the likely cause of crop failure due to low cumulative rainfall nyakudya and stroosnijder 2011 tillage had no significant influence on soil water content at the 0 50 cm depth for the tested period several studies have shown increased swc under minimum tillage sharma and abrol 2005 agbede 2010 which was contrary to our results minimum tillage plots could have experienced increased runoff and sediment yield limiting infiltration of water into the soil this was also observed by okeyo et al 2014 in a study conducted in the central highlands of kenya conventional tillage can lead to increased evaporation of moisture from the soil surface biazin and sterk 2013 hence reducing soil moisture a significant increase in swc under sole organic inputs rtim and rml particularly during low rainfall period could have been a result of increased soil organic carbon leading to increased water retention application of organic inputs such as manure biomass transfer tithonia diversifolia enhances soil organic carbon shisanya et al 2009 increased soil organic carbon leads to increased soil water retention rawls et al 2003 leon et al 2006 vanlauwe et al 2011 according to chivenge et al 2009 organic resources improve soil moisture availability many studies have also shown that addition of organic manure increases soil water repellency thus increasing aggregate stability and carbon sequestration khan et al 2007 blanco canqui and lal 2009 parras alcántara et al 2014 soil fertility inputs with organic manure rtim rml and rfm also led to increased swc in our study the organic inputs were also combined with the application of crop residues which is well known to increase soil water content lampurlanés and cantero martínez 2006 thierfelder and wall 2009 abdullah 2014 liu et al 2018 cereal legume intercrop rml significantly influenced swc in both sites legume based systems can induce improvements in soil physical structure predominantly soil water content due to reduced runoff during rainfall onset amede and kirkby 2004 masri and ryan 2006 the control showed higher soil water content than expected this could be ascribed to low plant transpiration due to poor foliage development leading to the observed low grain and stover yields in both sites 4 conclusion results from the on station trials in chuka and kandara central highlands of kenya showed enhanced maize crop performance and crop yields under soil fertility inputs in both sites treatments with mineral fertiliser sole mineral fertiliser crop residue mineral fertiliser and crop residue mineral fertiliser animal manure consistently affected maize plant positively as observed through enhanced chlorophyll content and plant height this underpins the importance of the combined effects of inorganic nitrogen during maize growth application of soil fertility inputs significantly improved grain and stover yields except under crop residue animal manure legume intercrop probably due to competition sole organic inputs enhanced soil moisture content in both sites this was attributed to the enhanced water holding capacity of the soil due to soil organic matter content increase thus this study highlights the possibility of improving agricultural production in the tropical sub humid regions experiencing erratic rainfall through the combined use of organic and inorganic inputs for soil fertility and soil water holding capacity restoration and enhancement emerging from the study however is the lack of advantage of minimum tillage over the conventional tillage within the period under consideration there is a pressing need to research on long term

11086,rigorous land ploughing and cropping fertiliser treatment and mineral fertiliser combined with animal manure treatment consistently enhanced maize crop growth and development as observed through enhanced chlorophyll content plant height and yields application of soil fertility inputs significantly improved grain and stover yields except in the crop residue combined with animal manure and legume intercrop treatment perhaps due to nutrients competition since lablab has an intensive rooting system sole organic inputs enhanced soil moisture content in both sites emerging from the study however is the lack of advantage of minimum tillage over the conventional tillage within the period under consideration thus this study highlights the possibility of improving soil water holding capacity through application of organic inputs such as crop residues tithonia diversifolia and manure either singly or in combination it further underpins the uniqueness of an integrated approach to soil fertility and low soil moisture content in the tropical sub humid regions experiencing erratic rainfallivity in the central highlands of kenya due to low and declining soil fertility inappropriate tillage methods soil water scarcity and prolonged dry spells in this study we assessed the effects of two tillage systems and soil fertility inputs on maize crop performance and soil water content the research was carried out in chuka and kandara sites in the central highlands of kenya for four seasons long rains 2016 short rains 2016 long rains 2017 and short rains 2017 the experimental design was a split plot with tillage method minimum and conventional as the main treatments and soil fertility inputs as the sub treatments sole mineral fertiliser mineral fertiliser combined with crop residue mineral fertiliser combined with animal manure tithonia diversifolia combined with phosphate rock minjingu animal manure intercropped with dolichos lablab l and a control conventional tillage with no inputs except for the control and sole mineral fertiliser crop residue was applied as mulch in all treatments based on the results the treatments with mineral fertiliser sole mineral fertiliser combined with mineral fertiliser treatment and mineral fertiliser combined with animal manure treatment consistently enhanced maize crop growth and development as observed through enhanced chlorophyll content plant height and yields application of soil fertility inputs significantly improved grain and stover yields except in the crop residue combined with animal manure and legume intercrop treatment perhaps due to nutrients competition since lablab has an intensive rooting system sole organic inputs enhanced soil moisture content in both sites emerging from the study however is the lack of advantage of minimum tillage over the conventional tillage within the period under consideration thus this study highlights the possibility of improving soil water holding capacity through application of organic inputs such as crop residues tithonia diversifolia and manure either singly or in combination it further underpins the uniqueness of an integrated approach to soil fertility and low soil moisture content in the tropical sub humid regions experiencing erratic rainfall keywords rain fed agriculture erratic rainfall organic inputs soil moisture content 1 introduction limited investment in soil nutrient replenishing inputs continuous land tillage and low and erratic rainfall are major causes of declining agricultural productivity in most countries of sub saharan africa ssa rusinamhodzi et al 2011 thierfelder et al 2013 tesfahunegn 2015 kiboi et al 2017 this is partly caused by continuous nutrient mining through crop harvesting and nutrient losses through runoff and erosion without commensurate replenishment through external soil fertility enhancing inputs application vanlauwe and giller 2006 bationo et al 2007 mucheru muna et al 2014 the effects of declining soil fertility are further exacerbated by the use of conventional tillage methods as most smallholder farmers believe that soil tillage is needed to maximise crop yield johansen et al 2012 also rain fed agriculture dominates the bulk of the arable land in ssa under smallholder farming system mupangwa et al 2012 besides the undesirable effect of tillage and low soil fertility in rain fed farming systems soil moisture is generally limited and crop growth is almost always stressed by drought during the growing season resulting in decreased and unsustainable crop yields ngetich et al 2014 hence there is a need for the assessment of the use of readily available organic inputs combined with different tillage methods for maximising soil water content and increasing crop production under the rainfed farming system several researchers have advocated soil fertility management through utilisation of organic resources solely or in combination with mineral fertiliser for increased crop yields mtambanengwe et al 2006 mucheru muna et al 2007 tueche and hauser 2011 herrmann et al 2014 pincus et al 2016 this is because most smallholder farmers use little or no inorganic fertilisers as they are expensive and unaffordable and sometimes not readily available when needed ayuke et al 2007 mugwe et al 2009 fermont et al 2010 for example farmers in the central highlands of kenya areas are harvesting maize yields below 1 0 mg ha 1 against a potential of 6 to 8 mg ha 1 partially due to declined soil moisture kiboi et al 2017 unbalanced nutrient mining and limited or none use of soil fertility restoring sources mucheru muna et al 2014 organic resources play essential roles in soil fertility management over inorganic fertiliser in sustainability terms they can supply plant nutrients and improve nutrient use efficiency contribute to long term soil organic matter som formation and maintenance and augmentation of soil physical properties palm et al 2001 lazcano et al 2013 combination of organic and inorganic resources has also been suggested as one of the effective ways of addressing soil fertility decline in farming systems with the low capacity to apply sufficient quantities of inorganic soil nutrients chivenge et al 2011a increased crop yield under sole organic inputs or combination of organic inputs and mineral fertilisers in ssa is widely reported teklay et al 2006 hepperly et al 2009 shisanya et al 2009 li et al 2010 pypers et al 2011 ibrahim et al 2015 hence the integration of organic and inorganic resources can have a positive impact on the soil quality and crop yields on smallholder farmers fields zingore et al 2007 besides nutrient additions through organic and inorganic sources different cropping intensification approaches like maize legume integration can aid in the maintenance of soil productivity improvement through soil nitrogen fixation and enhancement of som build up in the soil wortmann et al 2000 woomer et al 2003 however only a few farmers use mineral fertilisers and hardly use the recommended rates mugwe et al 2009 leading to partial soil nutrient replenishment and low yields although organic inputs are locally available in most smallholder farms most farmers seldom utilise them and mostly prefer to use mineral fertilisers which they rarely can afford in sufficient amounts in the central highlands of kenya soil fertility has been declining over time due to continuous cultivation with minimal soil nutrient replenishment in the quest to meet the food demands of the increasing population mucheru muna et al 2014 continuous cultivation which employs conventional continuous tillage method can alter soil physicochemical properties and crop performance conventional tillage alters the distribution of chemical properties in the soil profile and affects the physical and biochemical properties in the surface layer wyngaard et al 2012 it also leads to a decline in soil aggregate stability paul et al 2013 soil organic carbon soil water retention capacity martínez et al 2013 increases evaporation losses and heightens soils susceptibility to runoff generation ngetich et al 2014 resulting in decreased yields on the other hand according to luo et al 2010 minimum tillage can change the distribution of soil carbon in the soil profile concentrating it in the topsoil it can also foster som protection from hastened decomposition which can lead to the restoration of soil biological processes sanginga and woomer 2009 thus the potential of minimum tillage to increase crop yields can be attributed to its potential to improve water retention and consequently increase fertiliser responsiveness grabowski et al 2014 tillage systems that can enhance crop productivity under smallholder farming systems are therefore desirable erratic rainfall often obscures the responsiveness of crops to soil fertility management strategies aimed at increasing crop productivity in the study area crop production in the smallholder farming system is majorly rain fed the central highlands of kenya have been experiencing low and erratic rainfall with high occurrences of dry spells and drought jaetzold et al 2007 ngetich et al 2014 resulting in decreased and unstable yields kiboi et al 2017 crop residue retention increases water infiltration protects against soil erosion and enhance crop growth and development and can lead to increased grain yield and water use efficiency tao et al 2015 minimum tillage on the other hand can increase the capillary porosity as a result it enhances the water capacity of soil sharma and abrol 2005 application of organic inputs improves som which enhances soil water retention given that tillage systems and crop residue retention can influence soil water content and water use efficiency balwinder singh et al 2011 ma et al 2015 their judicious application in farming systems have the potential to pacify the effects of erratic rainfall patterns on crop performance to enhance crop performance and increase production emphasis should be placed on strengthening rain fed farming through effective soil management and tillage systems plants require a supply of sufficient nutrients and enough moisture for optimal productivity this can be achieved through the utilisation of assorted soil nutrients enhancing approaches such as animal manure biomass transfer cereal legume intercropping and crop residue retention the problem of unbalanced fertilisation is exacerbated by the limited range of fertiliser blends that are available and the prices thus inappropriate nutrient combinations are used particularly on food crops to enhance maize crop performance increase yields and improve soil water content effective tillage system and soil fertility management strategies are required we therefore set to determine the effects of minimum and conventional tillage systems and soil fertility inputs on maize crop performance and soil water content 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was carried out at chuka in tharaka nithi county and kandara in murang a county kenya fig 1 the rainfall pattern is bimodal in the two counties long rain season lr lasting from march to june and short rain season sr from late october to december jaetzold et al 2007 tharaka nithi county receives a total annual rainfall of 1200 to 1400 mm and an annual mean temperature of 20 c the predominant soil type is humic nitisols a typically deep and weathered soil with moderate to high inherent fertility jaetzold et al 2007 murang a county receives total annual rainfall of 900 to 1400 mm and a mean annual temperature of 21 3 c jaetzold et al 2007 the predominant soil type in the county is nitisols which are well drained extremely deep dusky red to dark reddish brown friable clay with acidic humic topsoil and moderate to high fertility maize is the dominant annual crop in the two counties the primary land use activities are subsistence farming livestock rearing cash crop farming and agroforestry the primary farming system in the area is mixed farming 2 2 experimental layout treatments and management a uniformity experiment was conducted during short rain season of 2015 sr15 in each site after which blocking was done based on crop performance we designed and established the experimental plots in chuka and kandara sites during long rains 2016 lr16 season the experimental design was a split plot arranged in a randomised complete block design the experiment was conducted for four cropping seasons long rains 2016 lr16 short rains 2016 sr16 long rains 2017 lr17 and short rains 2017 sr17 tillage was the main treatment while soil fertility inputs were the sub treatments the treatments table 1 were replicated four times at each site being the dominant annual crop in the two counties maize zea mays l variety h516 was the test crop the plot sizes were 6 m by 4 5 m and 4 5 m by 4 5 m in chuka and kandara respectively land preparation under conventional tillage d15 plots was done using a hand hoe to 15 cm depth while in minimum tillage d0 plots only planting holes were ploughed planting was done at inter and intra row spacing of 0 75 m by 0 5 m respectively in both sites three seeds were planted per hill to ensure maximum plant population two weeks after germination the excess plant was thinned out to remain with two plants per hill hence a population density of 53 333 plants ha 1 soil fertility inputs were applied to give an equivalent amount of 60 kg n ha 1 to meet maize nutrient requirements in the two study areas fertilizer use recommendation project furp 1987 phosphorus was applied as triple super phosphate tsp in treatments with sole mineral fertiliser and mineral fertiliser combination during planting at the rate of 90 kg p ha 1 the organic inputs animal manure and tithonia diversifolia were incorporated in the soil two weeks to the onset of the season in the d15 plots while in d0 plots they were incorporated only in the planting holes animal manure was obtained from local farms mixed thoroughly and dried under shade for at least two months tithonia diversifolia was harvested from nearby biomass transfer ridges weighed chopped into small pieces and incorporated in the soil a sample of each organic input was taken and n content determined animal manure had 2 1 of n while tithonia diversifolia had 3 8 from the n content results the amount of organics to be applied equivalent to 30 or 60 kg n ha 1 was calculated for the treatments with sole organics an equivalent of 60 kg n ha 1 was applied and for the treatments with combination an equivalent of 30 kg n ha 1 for each input was applied after thinning maize crop residue was uniformly 5 mg ha 1 surface applied in five treatments under each tillage system as shown in table 1 in d15 plots weeding was done thrice in a season using a hand hoe while under d0 it was by hand pulling stem borers were controlled by preventive application of tremor gr 0 05 a granule formulated synthetic pyrethroid insecticide with beta cyfluthrin being the active ingredient pesticide 2 3 data collection 2 3 1 crop growth indices four adjacent plants on the middle row per plot were sampled non destructive sampling during the 6th leaf stage ritchie et al 1997 and 10th leaf stage to determine the maize crop growth indices soil plant analysis development spad meter was used to measure the greenness or the relative chlorophyll concentration of maize leaves netto et al 2005 the relative maize leaf chlorophyll content chl measurements were taken from the 6th and 10th leaf counted from the base of the plant using a soil plant analysis development spad 502plus meter konica minolta optics inc japan three readings were recorded from the left and right sides and middle of the leaf and the mean recorded plant height was measured using a ruler as the distance from the base of the plant to the uppermost extended leaf tip 2 3 2 maize grain and stover yields maize grain was harvested at maturity from a net area of 21 m2 in chuka and 15 m2 in kandara after leaving out guard rows and the first and last maize plants in each row to minimise the edge effect the cobs in each plot were separated from the stover and fresh weight determined the cobs were then air dried separated from the grains through hand shelling weighed and grains moisture content determined the moisture content was determined using the dickey john minigac moisture meter the grain weight was corrected based on the measured moisture content determined to 12 5 equivalence and converted to per hectare basis stover weight was determined at harvest and samples taken weighted and further dried under shade until constant weight the ultimate weight of the dry stover was used to correct for moisture content of the stover weight and derivation of the per hectare stover yield 2 3 3 rainfall amount and soil water content daily rainfall measurement was obtained from a manual rain gauge installed at the sites at a distance of about 20 m from the experimental plots in the middle of each plot a pvc access tube was installed for soil water content measurement soil water content was measured weekly at 0 50 cm depth in each plot using diviner2000 version 1 5 190 capacitance sensor sentek sensor technologies stepney south australia the measurements were taken at regular intervals of 10 cm the diviner was gravimetrically calibrated using extra installed access tubes installed in adjacent plots next to the experimental plots with the same soil type the pvc access tubes were installed shortly after planting during the lr16 season thus measurements were not done immediately to allow the pvc tubes to equilibrate in the soil also during the lr17 season soil water content was not measured because the probe was damaged 2 4 data analyses the data were subjected to analysis of variance anova using the mixed procedure model in sas 9 3 software sas institute 2011 to obtain an f value of the model effect for treatments means comparison tukey s honestly significant difference test was used at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall amount and distribution differences in total rainfall amount and distribution between the cropping seasons were observed at each site fig 2 cumulatively rainfall received in chuka during the trials period was 2321 mm whereby 879 mm was received during lr16 385 mm during sr16 341 mm during lr17 571 mm during sr17 and 145 mm during off season periods fig 2a in kandara cumulative rainfall received during the trials period was 1197 mm with 329 mm received during lr16 243 mm during sr16 206 mm during lr17 419 mm during sr17 and 95 mm received during off seasons fig 2b both sites experienced a meteorological drought defined as the absence of rainfall for a period above twenty eight days during the growing season and dry spells absence of rainfall in periods ranging between 10 28 days during crop growing season during the experiment period rockström et al 2002 okeyo et al 2014 kiboi et al 2017 chuka site experienced a meteorological drought of 33 days and dry spells of 16 and 13 days while kandara site had a meteorological drought of 31 days and dry spells of 18 10 and 24 days during the lr16 season fig 2 at the beginning of the sr16 season a dry spell of 10 days was experienced in chuka and a meteorological drought of 31 days towards the end of the season fig 2 in kandara there were dry spells of 17 and 14 days at the onset of the sr16 season and a meteorological drought of 36 days at the end of the season during lr17 season there was a dry spell of 21 days at the beginning of the season and a meteorological drought of 31 days towards the end of the season in chuka during the same season in kandara there were dry spells of 17 10 and 16 days and a meteorological drought of 31 days at the end of the season in the sr17 season chuka experienced dry spells of 17 15 and 27 days while kandara had two dry spells of 10 days each and a meteorological drought of 43 days as earlier observed by mucheru muna et al 2014 in a study conducted in meru south tharaka nithi county dry spells mostly occurred during the peak periods of crop water requirement the differences in rainfall amounts beginning and end days and number of months the rain was received between long rains seasons and short rains seasons within each site indicated the distinction between the two cropping seasons annually we observed variation in rainfall amounts and distribution between seasons and frequent dry spells this was consistent with the findings of mucheru muna et al 2014 additionally rockström et al 2010 reported that sub humid agro ecosystems e g the study area experience high frequency of droughts and dry spells start days and the end of a rainy season and thus its length plus rainfall amounts and risk of dry spells within the season are essential aspects for crop growth because they strongly affect crop growth and productivity ngetich et al 2014 3 2 crop growth indices 3 2 1 relative leaf chlorophyll content spad values tillage and the interactions tillage soil fertility inputs had no significant effect on the relative leaf chlorophyll chl content during the trials period at the sixth and tenth leaf stage in chuka and kandara table 2 conversely chl content was significantly p 0001 affected by soil fertility inputs sfis during the 6th and 10th leaf stage table 2 throughout the trials period in both sites application of mineral fertiliser f showed the highest chl content during sixth leaf stage in all seasons in both sites except during lr17 season in chuka at the 6th leaf stage chl content was significantly p 0001 higher under f rf rfm rtim rtip and rml by 66 60 58 40 35 and 30 compared with the control in chuka during the lr16 season table 2 during the sr16 season chl content was significantly p 0001 higher under sfis with mineral fertiliser f rf and rfm by 49 37 and 30 compared with the control chlorophyll content was also significantly higher under rf f rfm and rtim by 24 21 18 and 9 respectively compared with the control during the lr17 season in chuka in kandara chl content was significantly p 0001 higher under f rf rfm and rtim by 48 47 40 and 20 respectively compared with the control during the lr16 season similar to chuka chl content was significantly higher in sfis with mineral fertiliser f rfm and rf by 12 11 and 11 compared with the control during the sr16 season in kandara moreover during lr17 season chl content was significantly high under sfis with mineral fertiliser f and rf by 37 and rfm by 30 compared with the control in kandara during the sr17 season chl content was only measured in chuka and was significantly high under f rf rfm and rtim by 52 35 30 and 18 compared with the control during the 10th leaf stage chl content was significantly p 0001 higher under rfm and rf by 38 rtip rtim f and rml by 34 32 26 and 11 compared with the control during the lr16 season in chuka table 2 chlorophyll content was significantly higher under sfis with mineral fertiliser rf f and rfm by 42 36 and 32 during the sr16 and lr17 f rf and rfm by 38 37 and 29 seasons compared with the control during the sr17 season chl content under rfm f rf rml and rtim was significantly greater by 55 50 48 34 and 26 compared with the control in chuka in kandara chl content was significantly higher under rfm f and rf by 57 44 and 37 compared to the control during the lr16 season table 2 compared with the control chl content significantly increased under f rf and rfm treatments by 28 27 and 23 during the sr16 and under rf f and rfm by 14 12 and 11 in lr17 seasons in kandara on average sole mineral fertilization led to the highest chl content followed by combination with organic inputs at the 6th and 10th leaf stage in all seasons compared with the control at both sites table 3 application of sfis significantly influenced maize leaf chl content at the two study sites this corroborated with the results of bayoumi and hafez 2006 who found that different organic and mineral fertiliser treatments significantly influenced chl content spad green colour reading on cucumber it was observed that sole mineral fertiliser led to the highest chl content during the sixth leaf stage in all seasons in both sites table 3 other studies have also reported a significant increase in chl content with the addition of n fertiliser jing et al 2010 subaedah et al 2016 high chlorophyll content observed under the combination of mineral fertiliser with crop residues rf and rfm was attributed to the readily available nitrogen from the mineral fertiliser npk addition of n fertiliser enhances decomposition of organic resources and n release okalebo et al 2006 chlorophyll concentration or leaf greenness is significantly affected by n status of the plant adamtey et al 2010 mansouri far et al 2010 abbasi et al 2013 a study by hauggaard nielsen et al 2013 reported that fertiliser treatments significantly p 0 0001 influenced maize chl content compared with the green manure and control treatments the significant increase in chl content under the combination of organics and mineral fertiliser was also reported by mohammadi et al 2013 under application of farmyard manure compost and mineral fertiliser as also observed in our study under rfm and rtip the significant increase in chl content under rtim could be ascribed to the fast decomposition rates of tithonia diversifolia hence readily available n for plant uptake while under rml could be the n from the legume crop this corroborates with findings of bilalis et al 2009 who observed a significant increase in chlorophyll content spad values of tobacco leaves under green manure application compared to the control the consistence was likely due to the similar soil texture of clay the soils in their site as reported in our study site by kiboi et al 2018 on the contrary liu and wiatrak 2011 and széles et al 2012 reported no significant change in maize leaf chl content as a result of n doses under rain fed conditions at the 6th leaf growth stage however they observed higher chl content under treatments with higher amounts of n 120 kg ha 1 the inconsistence could be due to differences in weather conditions whereby the two studies were carried out in dryland conditions whereas our study was in the sub humid areas the lowest chl contents were observed in the control treatment during all the measurement stages as also reported in a study by széles et al 2012 this is because there was no inputs n fertilization addition in the treatment 3 2 2 maize plant height tillage significantly p 0 04 influenced maize height at the sixth leaf stage during the lr16 season in kandara site only fig 3 b soil fertility inputs sfis significantly influenced maize height at the 6th and 10th leaf stage throughout the trials period in chuka fig 3a in kandara sfis significantly p 0001 influenced plant height during the lr17 season at the 6th leaf stage fig 3b compared with the control plant height significantly increased under sfis with mineral fertiliser that is rf f and rfm by 103 89 and 72 during the lr16 season and by 101 97 and 84 during both sr16 and lr17 season at the 6th leaf stage in chuka fig 3a during the sr17 season plant height

sr17 season in chuka fig 4 a and the lr17 season in kandara fig 4b soil fertility inputs significantly influenced maize height at the 10th leaf stage throughout the trials period in chuka during the lr16 season maize height significantly p 0 02 increased under rtim rfm rf rtip and f by 38 37 36 33 and 24 compared with the control in chuka fig 4a during the sr16 season maize height significantly p 0001 increased under rf f rfm rtim and rtip by 149 146 121 42 and 41 compared with the control while during lr17 season there was significant p 0001 increase under rfm rf f rml and rtip by 91 69 60 50 and 29 respectively during sr17 season plant height significantly increased in rtip rf rfm and f by 98 65 65 and 59 compared with the control at the 10th leaf stage in chuka in kandara sfi significantly influenced plant height during lr16 lr17 and sr17 season at the 10th leaf stage maize height significantly p 0001 increased under f rf rfm rtip and rtim by 47 45 44 24 and 18 compared with the control at the 10th leaf stage during the lr16 season fig 4b during the sr16 season the treatments had no significant influence on the maize height during 10th leaf stage in kandara on the other hand maize height was significantly p 0 003 influenced under tillage during the lr17 season in kandara whereby d15 performed better than d0 soil fertility inputs rfm rf rtip f and rtim significantly increased maize height at the 10th leaf stage by 16 9 9 7 and 7 compared with the control in kandara during the lr17 season during sr17 season plant height significantly increased under rfm f rtip and rf by 11 10 8 and 8 compared with the control in kandara maize plant height during the two sampling stages was highest during the lr16 season on average application of sole mineral fertiliser led to the highest plant height at the 6th leaf stage followed by the combination of fertiliser and organic inputs compared with the control during the trials period in chuka table 4 at the 10th leaf stage maize height was highest under fert org followed by use of fert compared with the control throughout the trial period except during the sr16 season in kandara on average plant height was significantly p 0001 influenced by soil fertility inputs at the sixth leaf stage only during the lr17 season table 4 at the 10th leaf stage on average maize height was significantly high under fert and fert org by 45 and 34 respectively compared with the control during the lr16 season combination of mineral fertiliser and organic inputs led to the highest maize height compared with the control during the lr17 and sr17 seasons in kandara plant height is one of the maize growth parameter that is affected by n availability yin et al 2011 mokhtassi bidgoli et al 2013 and essential in determining yield grains machado et al 2002 freeman et al 2007 fertilization can impact crop growth parameters such as plant height boomsma et al 2010 soil fertility inputs with mineral fertiliser f rf rfm rtip consistently led to greater plant height which was attributed to the readily available n various studies have reported a significant increase in maize plant height with mineral fertiliser application makinde 2007 yin et al 2011 several authors have also reported an increase in plant height of various crops as a result of fertiliser application for instance wu jun et al 2014 observed a significant increase in rice oryza sativa plant height in china while ehsanipour et al 2012 observed in fennel foeniculum vulgare mill combination of organic inputs and mineral fertiliser rtip showed an increase in plant height in both sites tabu et al 2007 also reported an increase in plant height under treatments with tithonia diversifolia and phosphate rock by 53 and 39 respectively application of sole organic inputs rtim rml also showed an increase in plant height in both sites the significant increase in maize height under rtim could be ascribed to the fast decomposition rates of tithonia diversifolia while under rml could be as a result of n from the legume drakopoulos et al 2016 also reported increased plant height in treatments using organic resources such as lucerne pellets under tillage d15 had higher plant height compared with d0 during the lr16 season at the 6th leaf stage at chuka and sr17 season at the 10th stage and during the lr17 season in kandara at the 10th leaf stage this could be due to restriction in roots development at the early stages of crop growth under minimum tillage low maize and wheat plant height in minimum or no till treatments have also been reported by several researchers babalola and opara nadi 1993 atreya et al 2008 adekalu et al 2009 oicha et al 2010 however other researchers have reported increased plant height under minimum tillage compared to conventional tillage lafond et al 2006 araya et al 2012 the highest maize plant height observed during the lr16 season was ascribed to the high rainfall amounts received during the season fig 2 leading to improved soil fertility inputs decomposition enhancing increased inorganic n uptake by the plants 3 3 maize grain and stover yields tillage had significantly p 007 higher maize grain yields by 12 compared to minimum tillage during the lr17 season in chuka in kandara grain yields were significantly p 0 01 high under minimum tillage by 22 compared with tillage during sr17 season table 5 soil fertility inputs significantly influenced grain yields during the trials period in both study sites grain yields significantly p 0001 increased under rfm rtim rtip rf and f by 120 103 94 93 40 compared with the control during the lr16 season in chuka table 5 during the sr16 season a decrease in grain yields was observed in chuka nevertheless they were significantly p 0001 higher under rfm rf f rtim and rtip compared with the control during the lr17 season grain yields significantly p 0001 increased under rfm rf f rtim and rtip by 131 114 72 67 and 35 compared with the control in chuka table 5 in kandara grain yields significantly p 0001 increased under rfm f rf rtim and rtip by 97 61 56 30 and 23 compared with the control during the lr16 season similar to chuka site grain yields decreased in kandara during the sr16 season all the same the yields were significantly p 0001 higher under f rfm rtim and rf by 165 137 134 117 and 58 compared with the control no grain yields were harvested in kandara during the lr17 season table 5 in both sites grain yields were not significantly different under rml compared with the control throughout the trial period also the interactions had no significant influence on grain yields for the four cropping seasons in the two study sites table 5 tillage significantly influenced maize stover yields during the lr16 p 0001 and sr16 p 0 0009 seasons in chuka site table 6 soil fertility inputs significantly influenced stover yields during the trial period in chuka during lr16 season stover yields significantly increased under rfm rf rtim rtip f and rml by 205 150 145 123 113 and 88 compared with the control in the sr16 season stover yields in chuka were significantly higher under rf rfm f rtip and rtim by 200 179 176 85 and 62 compared with the control during the lr17 season stover yields significantly increased under rfm rf rtim f and rtip by 71 65 38 38 and 18 compared with the control in kandara tillage had no significant influence on stover yields throughout the tested cropping seasons compared with the control stover yields significantly p 0 05 increased under rf rfm f and rtip by 141 98 89 and 84 respectively during the lr16 season in kandara table 6 during the sr16 season stover yields were significantly higher under rtim by 61 while in the lr17 season the yields increased under rfm rf rtim and rtip by 52 52 50 and 23 respectively compared with the control stover yields were not significantly different between rml and the control treatment during sr16 and lr17 seasons in chuka and during lr16 and sr16 seasons in kandara on average grain yields were highest under the combination of fertiliser and organic inputs followed by use of sole mineral fertiliser compared with the control during the lr16 lr17 and sr17 seasons in chuka table 7 in kandara grain yields were highest under fert org compared with the control during the lr16 season during the sr16 and sr17 seasons the yields were highest under application of fertiliser only table 7 on average stover yields in chuka were highest under fert compared with the control during the trial period except in the lr16 season table 7 in kandara use of sole fertiliser led to the highest stover yields during the lr16 and sr17 seasons while fert org had the highest yields during sr16 and lr17 seasons table 7 the high grain yields under d15 in chuka during lr17 season were attributed to the quicker supply of nutrients due to tillage before meteorological drought towards the end of the season conventional tillage fastens decomposition of inputs hence quick supply of nutrients earlier in the rainfall events dikgwatlhe et al 2014 increased yields under d0 in kandara during sr16 season was ascribed to the ability of reduced tillage to conserve soil water minimum tillage enhances soil water retention and fertilizer responsiveness compared with conventional tillage grabowski et al 2014 except for rml application of soil fertility inputs rfm rtip f rf and rtim significantly increased maize yields our results were consistent with that of a meta analysis done by chivenge et al 2011b and a study conducted by mucheru muna et al 2014 in central kenya the increased maize yields under the combination of organics and mineral fertiliser treatments rfm rtip could be ascribed to increased fertiliser use efficiency due to the balanced supply of nutrients for the crop application of organics may cause initial immobilisation of n but a combination with n fertilisers may result in improved synchrony between supply and demand of nutrients partey et al 2013 this results in enhanced use efficiency of the two resources resulting in positive interactive effects on crop yield chivenge et al 2011b the organics also enhance build up and maintenance of soil organic matter and improved soil moisture retention gentile et al 2008 rurinda et al 2013 leading to increased yields furthermore a combination of n fertilisers with low quality organic inputs in clayey soils enhances decomposition chivenge et al 2011a in their meta analysis chivenge et al 2011b also reported that the combined application of organics and n fertilisers more than doubled maize yields 114 compared to the no input control a study conducted for three years by zhang et al 2016 showed significant increase in maize yields in combination of compost npk and wheat straw compared with the control additionally a significant increase in maize yield under a combination of mineral fertiliser and or manure or maize residues compared to the control have been reported in numerous studies mtambanengwe et al 2006 gentile et al 2009 mugwe et al 2009 increased maize yields under crop residue retention and mineral fertiliser rf application were also recorded by anyanzwa et al 2010 increased maize yields under sole organic inputs rtim were also observed during the trials period in both sites organic resources usually release soil nutrients gradually and supply the crop throughout the growing period adediran et al 2005 several studies have reported a significant increase in yields as a result of sole organic inputs application for instance following the application of sole tithonia diversifolia biomass mucheru muna et al 2007 reported an increase of up to 267 in central kenya jama et al 2000 reported a yield increase of up to 200 in western kenya while mtambanengwe et al 2006 reported an increase of 525 following manure application in zimbabwe however application of rml had no significant effect on maize yield compared with the control throughout the trial period which could be due to high nutrient competition from the legumes the slow release of nutrients from manure and n immobilisation from the crop residue retention animal manure and maize crop residues are classified to be poor in supplying short term plant available n palm et al 2001 ngwira et al 2012 observed a reduction in maize yields when intercropped with lablab a study conducted in the central highlands of kenya also reported lower maize yields in treatments with herbaceous legumes compared to the control as a result of nutrient competition shisanya et al 2009 nyamangara et al 2013 also observed grain yield decline of 28 48 in residue retention and or legume based crop rotation compared to the control the differences in grain and stover yield among the various soil fertility inputs could have been as a result of differences in input quality their decomposition rates and rainfall amount decomposition of organic inputs is highly sensitive to soil moisture and clay content of the soil chivenge et al 2011a turmel et al 2015 tian et al 2007 observed increased decomposition rate and nutrient release with high quality organic input in wetter climates than in drier climates during the trial period there were frequent dry spells which could have inhibited the decomposition of the organic inputs the percentage increases in maize yield in our study were lower compared to other studies jama et al 2000 mucheru muna et al 2007 2014 which we attributed to low soil moisture as a result of the continuous decline in rainfall amount during the trial period for instance both study sites experienced a considerable decline in grain yields during the sr16 season due to decline in rainfall amounts fig 2 besides no maize grains were harvested in kandara during the lr17 season enfors et al 2011 reported substantial differences in grain yield and biomass between the seasons to be as a result of variable rainfall tillage had no significant effect on maize grain yields which is ascribed to the short period the trials were conducted and rainfall variation between cropping seasons conventional tillage is widely reported to result in low yields kiboi et al 2017 and conversion to minimum tillage would require a longer period to increase yields significantly after eight cropping seasons paul et al 2013 observed that tillage alone did not have a significant effect on maize yields and high annual variation in crop yields due to rainfall variation weakened the significance of tillage effects still in a study conducted for eight cropping seasons in malawi by thierfelder et al 2013 reported no significant difference in maize yields between conventional tillage and no tillage moreover after twelve years of experimentation maltas et al 2013 observed that reduced tillage had no significant effect on maize grain and aboveground biomass yields 3 4 soil water content total soil water content swc at 0 50 cm depth was significantly affected by soil fertility inputs in both sites during the two tested seasons sr16 and sr17 tables 8 and 10 the moisture content of the soil profile closely followed the seasonal rainfall pattern at both sites figs 5 and 6 both tillage and the interactions had no significant influence on swc at 0 50 cm depth in both sites table 8 at the vegetative phase swc was significantly higher under rtim and rml by 10 and 6 on date 8 12 2016 9 and 6 15 12 2016 and 8 and 7 30 12 2016 respectively compared with the control in chuka during the sr16 season table 8 and fig 5a during the grain formation and filling phase swc was significantly p 0 05 affected under rtim and rml during the measured days in chuka fig 5a and table 8 in kandara soil fertility inputs had no significant influence on swc in the vegetative grain formation and filling phases during the sr16 season fig 5b and table 8 however we observed a trend of the swc increasing under soil fertility inputs with sole organic inputs generally soil moisture declined during grain formation and filling phase in both sites during the sr17 season soil fertility inputs significantly influenced swc throughout the vegetative phase in chuka site table 9 and fig 6 still rtim and rml showed the highest swc compared with the control with the effect being highest when the rains decreased on date 18 11 2017 by 11 and 8 respectively in the grain formation and filling phase swc was significantly influenced by the soil fertility inputs except on date 30 12 2017 the increase was highest at the end of the phase 13 012 2018 by 12 and 10 under rtim and rml respectively compared with the control at kandara site swc was significantly influenced by the sfis at the start of the vegetative phase in the sr17 season table 9 and fig 6b at the start 03 11 2017 of the vegetative phase swc was significantly higher under rml and rfm by 3 compared with the control in the following dates i e 10 17 24 november 2017 and 01 12 2017 swc was significantly high only under rml compared with the control table 9 the significant influence in soil water content was observed during grain formation and filling stage in both sites when rainfall amounts decreased the pattern of fluctuation of the swc during the vegetative grain formation and filling phases remained similar during the two cropping seasons soil moisture influences crop growth not only by affecting nutrient availability but also nutrient transformations and soil biological behaviour soil moisture deficit that occurs during critical crop growth phases for example during flowering and grain formation and filling phases of maize can cause substantial yield reductions or even occasionally total harvest failure sime et al 2015 we observed severe yield decline during the sr16 season in both sites and grain yields failure in kandara during the lr17 season table 5 in a study conducted in central kenya mucheru muna et al 2014 observed that drought spells frequently occurred during the peak crop water requirement periods flowering and tussling poor rainfall distribution and low amounts are the likely cause of crop failure due to low cumulative rainfall nyakudya and stroosnijder 2011 tillage had no significant influence on soil water content at the 0 50 cm depth for the tested period several studies have shown increased swc under minimum tillage sharma and abrol 2005 agbede 2010 which was contrary to our results minimum tillage plots could have experienced increased runoff and sediment yield limiting infiltration of water into the soil this was also observed by okeyo et al 2014 in a study conducted in the central highlands of kenya conventional tillage can lead to increased evaporation of moisture from the soil surface biazin and sterk 2013 hence reducing soil moisture a significant increase in swc under sole organic inputs rtim and rml particularly during low rainfall period could have been a result of increased soil organic carbon leading to increased water retention application of organic inputs such as manure biomass transfer tithonia diversifolia enhances soil organic carbon shisanya et al 2009 increased soil organic carbon leads to increased soil water retention rawls et al 2003 leon et al 2006 vanlauwe et al 2011 according to chivenge et al 2009 organic resources improve soil moisture availability many studies have also shown that addition of organic manure increases soil water repellency thus increasing aggregate stability and carbon sequestration khan et al 2007 blanco canqui and lal 2009 parras alcántara et al 2014 soil fertility inputs with organic manure rtim rml and rfm also led to increased swc in our study the organic inputs were also combined with the application of crop residues which is well known to increase soil water content lampurlanés and cantero martínez 2006 thierfelder and wall 2009 abdullah 2014 liu et al 2018 cereal legume intercrop rml significantly influenced swc in both sites legume based systems can induce improvements in soil physical structure predominantly soil water content due to reduced runoff during rainfall onset amede and kirkby 2004 masri and ryan 2006 the control showed higher soil water content than expected this could be ascribed to low plant transpiration due to poor foliage development leading to the observed low grain and stover yields in both sites 4 conclusion results from the on station trials in chuka and kandara central highlands of kenya showed enhanced maize crop performance and crop yields under soil fertility inputs in both sites treatments with mineral fertiliser sole mineral fertiliser crop residue mineral fertiliser and crop residue mineral fertiliser animal manure consistently affected maize plant positively as observed through enhanced chlorophyll content and plant height this underpins the importance of the combined effects of inorganic nitrogen during maize growth application of soil fertility inputs significantly improved grain and stover yields except under crop residue animal manure legume intercrop probably due to competition sole organic inputs enhanced soil moisture content in both sites this was attributed to the enhanced water holding capacity of the soil due to soil organic matter content increase thus this study highlights the possibility of improving agricultural production in the tropical sub humid regions experiencing erratic rainfall through the combined use of organic and inorganic inputs for soil fertility and soil water holding capacity restoration and enhancement emerging from the study however is the lack of advantage of minimum tillage over the conventional tillage within the period under consideration there is a pressing need to research on long term

11087,the use of accurate and near real time volumetric soil moisture θ v m3 m 3 measurements informs not only precise irrigation scheduling but also decisions regarding fertiliser applications feed supply and stock management in non irrigated farming systems to assist θ v monitoring capacitance based aquacheck aquacheck south africa sensors are being increasingly used in precision agriculture applications however the performance of these sensors have not been investigated extensively under field conditions with dynamic soil moisture regimes for evaluation 20 probes 4 sensors unit were installed in predominantly silt loam soils on a pastoral hill country farm in the southern east coast of the north island of new zealand raw readings and θ v derived from a manufacturer recommended calibration were compared with 400 reference θ v values over a one year timespan 01 11 2016 01 12 2017 in addition three custom calibration methods were developed and assessed each tailored to suit the availability of soil information over all depths 100 to 400 mm the manufacturer calibration resulted in θ v readings with a mean rmse of 0 106 m3 m 3 a mean mbe of 0 099 m3 m 3 indicating underestimation and a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 58 when correlated to reference θ v values a single custom formula relevant to the local soils resulted in an improved rmse of 0 039 m3 m 3 and r2 0 58 while probe specific calibrations achieved an rmse of 0 029 m3 m 3 and r2 of 0 77 the application of sensor specific calibration resulted in an rmse of 0 019 m3 m 3 with r2 0 9 temporal sensor responses to the magnitude of rainfall events closely agreed sensor performance and accuracy errors were observed to vary as a function of soil wetness bulk density ρ b gcm 3 clay and total

monitoring is rapidly developing across different types of soil plant systems over many landscape features at a time of increasing food demand and more intense agricultural drought events howell 2001

meteorological applications rowntree and bolton 1983 and flood risk evaluation massari et al 2014 at catchment scales soil water content controls the soil infiltration rate runoff and evapotranspiration influencing plant water availability that plays an essential role in precision agriculture as the single most important natural resource for pasture production rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 woodward et al 2001 due to the interaction of numerous environmental parameters soil water content is generally considered a both temporally and spatially highly changeable soil physical state variable although the spatial patterns have been observed to remain stable over time vachaud et al 1985 vanderlinden et al 2012 brocca et al 2017 soil water content predictability and variability are not yet fully understood especially near the surface and within the root zone these being the layers of interest for most applications wilson et al 2004 petropoulos et al 2014 root zone soil moisture is particularly useful for the evaluation of climate land surface and energy exchange models while in situ near surface soil moisture data is utilised in the validation and calibration of remotely sensed soil water products dorigo et al 2011 liu et al 2017 consequently obtaining accurate frequent and non destructive soil water data is significantly advantageous if not essential to facilitate improved yield and water management strategies in both irrigated and non irrigated farming systems several indirect methods measure a physico chemical property of the soil to estimate soil water content evett and parkin 2005 the radioactive technology and the idea of the neutron moisture metre published by gardner and kirkham 1952 induced a breakthrough in modern soil moisture estimation calibrated neutron moisture meters are able to achieve high soil moisture sensing accuracy although the technique is extremely costly and it poses special requirements for installation and operation the technique remained the standard until the age of dielectric sensors arrived in the 1980s ochsner et al 2013 since then a wide range of electromagnetic soil water content sensing devices have been developed robinson et al 2008 state of the art continuous soil water measurement techniques make use of the dielectric property of the sensed soil matrix lekshmi et al 2014 it has long been recognised that the measurement of the soils apparent dielectric constant k a can be directly related to volumetric soil water content θ v m3 m 3 sensitivity dean et al 1987 time domain reflectometry tdr frequency domain reflectometry fdr and capacitance techniques are the most common methods to obtain soil water content by emitting electromagnetic energy pulses into the soil the basics of tdr fdr and capacitance techniques for soil water measurement were established by topp et al 1980 and dean et al 1987 the techniques rely on the physical principle that water in soil pores has a significantly higher k a 81 at 20 c than air in soil pores 1 and higher than the typical mineral matrix of soils 3 12 dean et al 1987 noborio 2001 chandler et al 2004 the tdr method relates soil water content to the travel time of the electromagnetic signal along a transmission line since the propagation velocity of the electromagnetic energy impulse is mainly influenced by soil k a blonquist et al 2005 the generally expensive tdr sensors are commonly utilised as a reference bogena et al 2007 due to their high accuracy and good agreement with observations obtained by neutron scattering serrarens et al 2000 the fdr technique differs from tdr in that the former measures the variation of frequency of the returned electromagnetic pulses capacitance based sensing devices are based on the frequency domain although they make use of the charging time of the emitted electromagnetic field which is a function of soil k a mittelbach et al 2012 during measurement a capacitor system is formed by two or more electrodes metal rods spikes or rings inserted in the soil which serves as the dielectric an oscillator is often connected to the circuit this converts the changes in soil k a to the variation in the frequency of the transmitted signal between the electrodes leib et al 2003 lekshmi et al 2014 soil k a is influenced by factors other than soil water content such as variation in soil bulk density ρ b clay content temperature soil organic matter and salinity topp et al 1980 roth et al 1990 tsheko and savage 2005 the sensing volume of fdr and capacitance techniques is relatively small and the operating frequency is generally below 100 mhz therefore these sensors have been observed to be sensitive to clay content soil organic matter content air gaps temperature amount of iron minerals and ρ b robinson et al 1994 muñoz carpena et al 2004 dobriyal et al 2012 mittelbach et al 2012 visconti et al 2014 fares et al 2016 in an attempt to circumvent this calibrations provided by the manufacturer are generally developed under laboratory conditions by immersing the sensing units in solutions or in a soil medium with known parameters kizito et al 2008 capacitance sensors have been proven to be accurate for effective soil water monitoring for either scientific or agronomic purposes if a soil specific calibration is provided matula et al 2016 singh et al 2018 offering a significantly lower cost alternative to tdr evett 2000 mittelbach et al 2012 visconti et al 2014 however their accuracy and dependency on soil properties have not been investigated extensively under field conditions particularly not in new zealand on diverse hill country landscapes and soils aquacheck ltd has more than 20 000 probes installed in more than 20 countries around the world highlighting its key role among the industry s leading vendors in the rapidly growing global soil moisture sensor market space agri optics 2017 these numbers are expected to rise worldwide imposed by the increased pressure on sustainable agricultural productivity and the growing concern about climate soil health and conservation to date aquacheck sub surface sensor performance and the assessment of standard calibration functions have received little scientific attention although they have been employed in several studies cronje and mostert 2008 murungu et al 2011 aquacheck reported soil moisture data were compared to enviroscan readings chosen as reference by nolz 2013 however no comparisons were made against direct soil moisture measurements recently singh et al 2018 presented a detailed evaluation of a variety of electromagnetic sensors in a loam soil in nebraska u s including the aquacheck classic probe aquacheck readings were related in reference to field calibrated neutron moisture meter observations however their study had a short timeframe from 28 july to 6 september 2016 and a narrow soil water content range additionally the research was based on the statistical comparison of averaged soil moisture readings from two replicates at each of two selected depths separately and combined a criticism of the singh et al 2018 paper was published by schwartz et al 2018 questioning and commenting on the meaningfulness of the comparison between electromagnetic sensors and a neutron probe in the reply of rudnick et al 2018 the authors reviewed the results in singh et al 2018 and rejected the claim proposed in schwartz et al 2018 rudnick et al 2018 clearly stated that their approach intended to generate a scientific review of the sensors available for customers rather than a comprehensive comparison our study aims to evaluate the performance of 400 mm aquacheck sub surface multi sensor capacitance probes during a one year period under field conditions in silt loam and silty clay loam soils a comparison was made between sensor data collected from 20 spatially distributed probes and reference thermo gravimetric observations to achieve this aim our objectives are to 1 assess the manufacturer supplied calibration functions and establish new functions between raw sensor readings and reference observations to improve θ v sensing accuracy at multiple depths these custom calibrations will occur at three scales i e farm i e single calibration probe i e site specific 20 calibrations and sensor i e sensor specific 80 calibrations 2 investigate temporal θ v patterns and compare differences in accuracy between the custom calibration methods and the manufacturer provided calibrations that were most suitable for the soil type at the research area 3 provide aspects about measurement accuracy for sensor users to help decision making on whether the complete at sensor level calibration is necessary for their applications 4 determine the effect of selected soil properties and soil wetness on sensor error distribution our intent is to inform future deployment of capacitance based sensor probes for accurate predictions of multi depth θ v patterns on new zealand hill country soils or in regions with similar soil characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and soil characterisation the study was conducted on a 2600 ha hill country property patitapu station located in the wairarapa region of the north island of new zealand 40 745020 s 175 887320 e fig 1 the research site is primarily non irrigated pastoral farmland mixed with native bush on rolling to steep hills interspersed with fertile flat land sixty four year annual average rainfall is 1144 mm in this area with a range between 721 1735 mm niwa cliflo 1953 2017niwa cliflo 2017niwa cliflo 1953 2017 although precipitation is often localised in hill country elevation ranges from 143 to 531 m above sea level the soil water monitoring sites fig 1 were selected from pastoral areas on the farm where the predominant plant communities are ryegrass and clover species a permanent weather station 40 750032 s 175 887493 e was installed at the property from where rainfall and air temperature observations were collected to investigate sensor response to climatic variables the minimum maximum and mean distance between the climate monitoring station and sensing probes were 0 34 2 9 and 1 8 km respectively soil resource information was retrieved from the fundamental soil layers that describes the spatial pattern of soil types defined by the new zealand soil classification nzsc hewitt 2010 the majority of the property is covered by brown soils as it is illustrated on fig 1 at the group level a common soil in the east side of the north island the orthic brown bo soil dominates over the study site while patches of orthic gley go soils occur along the main water ways and firm brown bf soils can be found in the eastern side of the property with higher altitudes the topsoil is typically described as dark grey brown while the subsoil is often brown or yellow brown with generally well drained characteristics and fine texture 2 2 instrumentation and sensor data collection 2 2 1 aquacheck multi sensor probe specifications the capacitance based 400 mm aquacheck sub surface probe is a robust multi level device with four sensors spaced at intervals of 100 mm and with a right hollow cylindrical shaped sampling range the sphere of influence can be approximated with geometric parameters of h 60 mm cylinder height r 16 mm internal radius and r 20 45 mm external radius the probes are designed to be completely buried with an attached wire for data transmission to a logger fig 2 b the sensor transforms the frequency readings to scaled frequency s f as raw output the s f values range from 0 100 where 0 is equal to a reading in open air and 100 when the sensor is immersed in distilled water s f is calculated as follows 1 s f f a i r f s f a i r f a where f s is the frequency reading in the soil f a i r is the sensor frequency reading in air and f a is the sensor frequency reading in distilled water zettl et al 2015 the s f readings are automatically corrected for possible inherent temperature change by embedded compensation functions to calculate θ v s f values need to be converted using an empirical laboratory based calibration curve the conversion is not a built in function therefore the device is offered with factory calibration equations for six soil textures e g sand clay silt loam loam clay and generic composited from sand silt loam and clay soils agri optics 2017 the linear calibration equations provided by the manufacturer are in the form shown by equation 2 2 θ v b 0 b 1 s f where b 0 and b 1 are the y intercept and slope parameters of the generalised linear regression model and are dependent on the six determined soil textures for the purpose of this study the resulting θ v output was converted to θ v m3 m 3 2 2 2 wireless sensor network based data collection and monitoring site design at patitapu station a communication network utilising wireless sensor network wsn technology was deployed for the investigation of soil water distribution and temporal change in the root zone over a wide range of topographical positions on the farm the wsn architecture is composed of 20 multi sensor probes a gateway unit base station and connecting point to the cellular network and a repeater station arrayed in a mesh topology a typical example of a soil moisture monitoring site is shown on fig 2a each multi sensor probe was connected to robust long range telemetry units for logging and transmission of data via radio connection to the gateway each multi sensor probe was buried vertically fig 2b and placed approximately 4 m away from the radio unit with a connecting cable running through a sealed underground alkathene pipe manufacturer provided instructions were followed during the probe installation to avoid preferential water flow and air gaps as well as to ensure optimal sensor contact with the soil the interface board and battery recharged by a solar panel were placed in a weatherproof enclosure mounted on a galvanised pole along with a long range omnidirectional antenna fig 2a the halo farm system an online service developed by tag i t technologies ltd new zealand hamilton was used for web based data collection and management via cellular network the criteria associated with the research objectives and the farm management required the multi sensor probes to be buried this also provided equipment protection a two month period prior to the experiment was allowed for the sensors to equilibrate with the surrounding soil for the purpose of this study sensor readings were retrieved from the wsn database at the time closest to the time stamps of the sampling events at each site giving a maximum of 7 5 min of time difference between sensor reading and sampling there was no false or unusual reading in the analysis based on a comparison to the previous and the following three sensor readings 2 2 3 soil sampling the soil sampling events were carried out during dry θ v 0 25 m3 m 3 moderately wet θ v 0 35 m3 m 3 and wet θ v 0 45 m3 m 3 stages of θ v conditions over five sampling events on 21 11 2016 23 02 2017 24 04 2017 31 10 2017 and 18 11 2017 as marked on fig 10 during four sampling events the gravimetric samples were taken using a soil auger 5 cm approximately 0 6 0 8 m away from the multi sensor probe location avoiding the upper slope areas fig 3 a three soil cores were collected at each location and the cores divided into four depths 70 130 170 230 270 330 and 370 430 mm corresponding to the depth of the soil volume sampled by each sensor fig 3b the samples were immediately placed in sealed containers inside a cooling box and taken directly to the laboratory to be processed for one sampling event the three soil cores were kept separate to ascertain variability caused by the sampling method for the other three sampling events the samples were composited for each depth and treated as one sample in the laboratory one sampling event acquired samples with known volume for both ρ b and gravimetric water content measurements by opening two narrow 0 5 m deep pits approximately 0 4 m from the multi sensor probe fig 3a and c the gravimetric samples were obtained using 84 76 cm3 steel cylinders within which the soil material was retained for subsequent drying at 105 c for 24 h and analysis soil variability tends to be greater near the soil surface in hill country due to the interrelated effects of grazing livestock soil organic matter land use topsoil downslope movement rooting characteristics and the presence of soil organisms stavi et al 2008 chaudhari et al 2013 hence five replicates were taken from 100 mm depth while three replicates were obtained for all other depths mid points of the sampling depths corresponded to those of the sensing volume of each sensor sampling holes were subsequently infilled with soil from the same horizon preserving the compaction and order of soil layers as much as possible 2 2 4 soil description and soil texture in this study a laser scattering particle size distribution analysis was performed on composited samples three replicates at each depth using a horiba la 950 horiba scientific kyoto japan instrument to determine texture the diameter range of the individual particle size classes were defined by the u s department of agriculture usda gee and bauder 1986 and their size limits adopted in this analysis since it has been generally used in new zealand for texture analysis fig 4 a and b summarise the results from the particle size analysis grouped by depth along with the means and standard deviations of the ρ b values at each site most of the 300 and 400 mm soil increments exhibited fine textured silty clay loam characteristics with 25 and 28 average clay content respectively soil layers nearer the surface tend to fall in the silt loam class with increased proportions of sand fractions and less than 20 clay content increasing ρ b values were observed with increasing depth with a mean ρ b of 1 1 gcm 3 for 100 mm 1 22 gcm 3 for 200 mm 1 32 gcm 3 for 300 mm and 1 37 gcm 3 at 400 mm depth fig 4b apart from ρ b soil water holding properties are dependent on particle size distribution as well as total organic carbon content toc which are the main parameters in most pedotransfer functions that predicts field capacity saturation plant available water and permanent wilting point yang et al 2014 minasny and mcbratney 2018 thus toc values were derived for each sensing depth at each site by a dry combustion method using a vario macro cube chns elemental analyser elementar analysensysteme gmbh hanau germany the soil samples taken on 31 10 2017 were used for the analysis providing a dominantly decreasing trend in toc content with depth at most monitored locations the toc values ranged between 2 01 5 31 mean 3 48 at 100 mm 0 64 4 27 mean 2 13 at 200 mm 0 54 2 91 mean 1 32 at 300 mm and 0 52 2 39 mean 0 99 at 400 mm soil depth reference soil water content to obtain reference soil water content values soil samples were taken from multiple depths and the gravimetric water content θ g was measured by the standard gravimetric technique schmugge et al 1980 this approach has been most widely used for the determination of soil moisture lekshmi et al 2014 and is still the most accurate reference technique for custom calibration parvin and degré 2016 brocca et al 2017 for each individual sensor the laboratory θ g value was converted to θ v by multiplying by the mean ρ b value a wide range of θ v values 0 177 0 498 m3 m 3 was obtained from a total of 400 θ g measurements these θ v values were employed as the standard base for comparisons and are referred to as reference θ v in the following sections of the paper 2 3 calibration methods and sensor evaluation 2 3 1 custom calibration approach custom calibration was carried out at three levels of scale to provide options for users depending on their knowledge regarding the monitored soils a farm specific calibration fc used the entire dataset to provide a single linear relationship i e a single equation for the research area at the next level of detail monitoring site specific calibration sic formulas were developed to provide a linear calibration for each site probe 20 in total these calibrations ignored the change in soil properties with depth at the highest level of detail sec a custom calibration formula was determined for each depth for each sensor resulting in 80 individual calibration equations 2 3 2 statistical assessment of factory calibration and sensor accuracy in this study θ v values computed by various factory calibration formulas were compared the relationship between s f and reference θ v was analysed and sensor reported θ v determined by three custom calibration and factory supplied functions were related to reference θ v a simple linear regression approach was followed to investigate how s f and reference θ v were associated the assessment was performed for different subsets based on depth and calibration type to identify errors and model fit for each group for the evaluation of sensor accuracy and the applicability of factory calibration functions two primary statistical indicators were utilised i e the degree of coincidence and the degree of association the degree of coincidence was expressed by absolute accuracy error aae eq 3 mean bias error mbe eq 4 mean absolute error mae eq 5 and root mean square error rmse eq 6 to assess how well sensor measurements matched the reference water content values following the equations in willmott 1982 aae mbe mae and rmse are considered as best measures of overall accuracy reliability and model performance the simultaneous use of these metrics are often beneficial to assess model performance thus their customised forms are commonly applied in evaluation studies willmott 1982 chai and draxler 2014 the simplest measure aae was used to retrieve the magnitude of difference for each sample pair of sensor reported values and reference θ v aae is the most useful when individual data pairs are examined if the aae values are averaged over multiple measurements the mbe can be obtained that intends to measure average model bias the mbe value can convey information on the degree of overestimation positive or underestimation negative sheiner and beal 1981 when calibration methods are compared to each other or to the reference θ v measurements the linear score of mae was also calculated that measures accuracy by giving the average magnitude of the prediction errors regardless their direction and by weighing individual differences equally ideally θ v measurements are preferred within a certain threshold depending on applications and sensor type and large errors are not desirable therefore rmse was computed to penalise data pairs with large differences by giving them proportionally high weights the coefficient of determination r2 the square of the pearson correlation coefficient was selected as a measure of the degree of association indicating how well regression models can be fitted to raw sensor data calibrated datasets and to reference θ v data 3 a a e y s e n i y r e f i 4 m b e 1 n i 1 n y s e n i y r e f i 5 m a e 1 n i 1 n y s e n i y r e f i 6 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y s e n i y r e f i 2 where i is the data pair index n is the number of observations y s e n is the sensor data and y r e f is the reference θ v a general linear model approach two way factorial analysis of variance anova was chosen to test the effect of soil physical properties soil depth and calibration type on sensor response firstly sensor readings at five s f levels i e 40 50 60 70 80 0 5 and their corresponding reference θ v values were selected to examine whether the sensors would produce the same s f values if either the soil texture or ρ b was different secondly anova offers a statistical means of assessing the influencing power of a measured variable i e clay content ρ b on a dependent continuous variable i e sensor error in addition to a secondary categorical variable i e depth calibration method that contain a finite number of categories the influencing power of soil properties was expressed by statistical significance p value and mean measurement error it is assumed that the measured soil variables have not been controlled by the experiment but are considered to influence sensor performance it is also assumed that the relationship between the measured soil properties and the sensor errors are linear based on previous findings regarding electromagnetic sensors types varble and chávez 2011 parvin and degré 2016 to help visualising these relationships interaction plots are commonly used to analyse the interaction between categorical variables and a continuous response depending on the value of another factor calibration method for example the effect of clay content and ρ b on sensor error was visualised by displaying the levels of clay content ρ b on the x axis with the means of the continuous variable for each factor level on the y axis both anova related analyses were conducted using the r statistical software version 3 4 1 r core team 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of manufacturer provided formulas the sensors measured s f was converted to θ v by the factory provided conversion equations and compared to 400 80 samples per sampling event corresponding reference θ v while the soils at the monitoring sites are mainly silt loam or silty clay loam five conversion formulas were selected for comparison table 1 provides a depthwise summary about the statistical measures of the various factory supplied calibration due to the linear nature of the factory calibration r2 values varied only with depth giving a range of 0 74 0 49 through the observed soil profile during the examination of the manufacturer calibration functions the closest agreement with reference θ v was achieved by the loam soil specific factory calibration performing slightly better than the clay soil formula the loam calibration resulted in a range of 0 038 0 043 m3 m 3 for rmse between the reference θ v and the sensor reported θ v across all depths providing the best overall accuracy the generic and clay loam calibration functions did not perform well providing very similar error levels with 0 071 0 109 m3 m 3 rmse the loam type of factory calibration resulted in 0 163 m3 m 3 root mean squared difference in loamy soils in comparison to neutron scattering observations according to singh et al 2018 which also highlights the uncertainty in the manufacturer calibrations and the need for soil or site specific formulas the silt loam type of conversion significantly underestimated the θ v giving 0 0985 m3 m 3 of mbe and rmse between 0 095 0 125 m3 m 3 depending on depth in comparison with the other four texture specific methods the silt loam calibration showed the largest underestimation of the true θ v the assessment also showed generally higher error values in the top half of the profile than in the deeper sections regardless of the calibration method which was also observed by nolz 2013 when comparing aquacheck readings to enviroscan estimations similar trends were reported by mittelbach et al 2012 during an evaluation of low cost sensors to tdr measurements on loam and clay loam soils in switzerland taking into consideration the soil textural properties found at the majority of the monitoring sites users would apply the silt loam specific equation to compute θ v for their applications therefore the silt loam formula was selected and referred to as manufacturer calibration mc in the further analysis and various comparisons 3 2 regression calibration 3 2 1 relating raw sensor readings to reference volumetric water content raw sensor outputs as a function of true θ v were analysed by fitting a linear model on s f and reference θ v the relationship between s f and reference θ v demonstrated significant positive linear correlations at every depth fig 5 a however the slope and intercept of the fitted models differed for the various soil depth intervals fig 5b the linear regression explained 58 of the variability on the entire dataset and 74 57 54 and 58 at 100 200 300 400 mm depth respectively since the correlation between raw aquacheck s f and reference θ v was characterised as positive moderate r2 between 0 5 0 7 and strong r2 0 7 a linear regression calibration approach was followed to develop custom calibration functions to improve the precision of θ v predictions at different sites and depths on the study farm since there is a saturation or plateau effect at the extremely wet end of the soil θ v range fig 10 a more complex model fit seems desirable for these conditions a laboratory based calibration process on site specific soil samples could potentially improve the model fit between raw s f readings and high resolution reference θ v covering the entire sensing range and lead to the development of non linear models considering the linear regression approach followed by the manufacturer and the main objectives of the study the linear calibration method seemed to be the most practical statistical approach that could be easily reproduced by individuals not belonging to the scientific community 3 2 2 development of the custom calibration functions and model fit analysis fig 6 presents the steps and results of an example how sic fig 6a and sec fig 6b equations were developed at a selected soil monitoring site namely site 9 notice mc fc and sic methods use only one single equation for each probe at a particular location the sic model was fitted on reference θ v and s f readings obtained from all four depths containing 20 data pair at each site the sec formula was generated from five data pair for every individual sensor as a final step θ v computed by mc fc sic sec were compared and correlated to the reference θ v to assess the difference in the converted θ v by various calibration functions fig 6c and d the general trend given by the reference θ v was followed by both the mc and the custom calibration formulas fig 6c although it is clearly indicated that the custom linear regression coefficients are able to offer a better agreement between the sensor predictions and the reference θ v fig 6d plots the model fits after calibration where sec method evidently demonstrated an improved 0 89 r2 as opposed to the 0 64 r2 given by the other three calibration methods the calibration process and the computation of r2 values were completed on every site at each depth for the four calibration methods fig 7 a summarises the results grouped by the methods and fig 7b presents the statistical distribution of r2 at each depth the correlations between the sensor predictions and the reference θ v obtained at the four soil depths fig 7b were significantly different indicating that one calibration formula for one monitoring site might not be sufficient thus sec for each soil depth may be used for applications where high accuracy is required the model fit for the 100 mm soil depth produced the highest mean r2 of 0 91 and the 400 mm soil depth demonstrated the lowest 0 70 r2 while 200 and 300 mm depth intervals performed similarly well giving 0 8 and 0 77 of r2 in terms of calibration methods sec method with 0 86 mean r2 demonstrated considerably better fit than the mc fc and sic methods showing mean r2 of 0 66 each 3 2 3 custom calibration accuracy and error assessment to investigate the improvement in accuracy θ v values calculated by mc fc sic and sec were correlated to reference θ v data and the change was examined both on the entire dataset fig 8 a and at each depth fig 8b the custom regression calibrations fc sic and sec led to substantial improvement in terms of accuracy of θ v prediction considering the entire dataset the overall regression developed for fc resulted in appreciable improvement compared to the mc method the sic method resulted in rmse of 0 029 m3 m 3 compared to 0 039 m3 m 3 for fc and 0 106 m3 m 3 if the mc approach was utilised the best performance was achieved by the sec formulas with mean rmse of 0 019 m3 m 3 table 2 the mae ranged from 0 09 0 118 0 025 0 039 0 019 0 029 and 0 013 0 019 m3 m 3 for mc fc sic and sec respectively meaning that the absolute error and the error range through four depths were reduced by moving towards the calibration at the sensor level mbe varied between 0 089 0 118 for mc 0 021 0 007 for fc 0 016 0 027 for sic and gave 0 000 m3 m 3 for sec suggesting that θ v obtained by mc considerably underestimated the gravimetrically measured reference θ v sec was able to remove the presence of systematic over or underestimation as the errors cancelled out table 2 these results show that even a single farm specific calibration will perform better than the universal factory formulas if the sensors are used in precision agriculture applications a sec calibration will produce accuracy beyond the single fc and sic calibration making perceivable difference on the long run in irrigation scheduling furthermore fertiliser applications are strongly dependent on the right amount of θ v monaghan et al 2007 ma and herath 2016 thus more precise timing of inputs at least matter of days can be chosen by using the most detailed sec method however the distribution of errors in relation to reference θ v was not uniform the pattern of error distributions was examined by the correlation of reference θ v and the calculated aae for each custom and mc methods as plotted in fig 9 to describe θ v conditions during the five sampling events the frequency distribution of reference θ v was displayed in the bottom of fig 9 for each depth the histograms clearly demonstrate the wider range and higher variability of reference θ v in the surface than in the deeper sections at the 300 and 400 mm depths the shape of the data is slightly skewed to the left showing that the deeper part of the soil profile was usually wetter than the surface on the date of sampling events in the upper section of fig 9 normal confidence ellipsoids were added to the scatter plot matrix with 95 confidence level as a graphical representation of correlation between aae and reference θ v friendly et al 2013 at every depth the ellipsoids are stretched out diagonally from top left to bottom right indicating negative linear correlation the analysis revealed that sensor readings tend to overestimate the true θ v at drier soil conditions θ v 0 28 0 35 m3 m 3 depending on the depth and calibration type on the other hand underestimation occurred during the wetter soil stages the largest aae increased to 0 012 m3 m 3 if fc and to 0 009 m3 m 3 if sic method was applied at 100 mm depth the fc and sic methods led to considerably reduced errors sic being more accurate than fc at every depth level in general the lowest aae was observed if sec calibration was used with less significant correlation while the largest absolute differences were given by the mc sec was able to limit the aae to around 0 05 m3 m 3 for most observations at all depths the more elongated ellipses in the 100 200 mm depths suggest higher correlation r2 of 0 56 for fc 0 5 for mc 0 30 for sic and 0 05 for sec at 100 mm than the less elongated nearly circular shaped ellipsoids for the deeper parts of the monitored soil profile r2 of 0 26 for fc 0 21 for mc 0 1 for sic and 0 13 for sec at 400 mm r2 typically decreased as the scale of the calibration moved from fc towards the sec suggesting improvement and less sensitivity to high and low moisture conditions these results depict that the effect can be minimised by calibration at the probe or sensor level thus underestimation and overestimation can be diminished in comparison with mc furthermore mittelbach et al 2011 and mittelbach et al 2012 found similar aae trends for capacitance and fdr based sensors who also emphasised the importance of site specific calibration and the sensitivity to soil types that agree with the findings of this study a sensor specific calibration might be an ideal option when the soils have variable physical properties within the monitored profile the collected and analysed data indicates that the aquacheck sensors can be effectively field calibrated using direct gravimetric measurements consequently the new calibration coefficients developed in this study could be used for soils with similar textural properties the key findings of this study is supported by other field based evaluation experiments stating that root mean square difference values dropped significantly when site specific or sensor specific equations were applied rudnick and irmak 2014 singh et al 2018 the generated custom calibration functions are expected to carry robust representations of accurate soil water measurements since a wide spectrum of θ v were used for the analysis along with sensor reported data acquired from 20 replicates therefore the wsn deployed at patitapu station can be applied to validate soil moisture products from other sources such as remote sensing 3 3 prediction of soil water temporal trends exploring the long term behaviour of sensor response and general probe reliability through a time series based comparison is of great importance since it can reveal hysteresis effects reliability issues technical problems and variation in measurement accuracy it also highlights the relevance of soil or site specific calibration development in capturing moisture sorption and desorption especially when irrigation scheduling is guided by real time soil water data from in situ sensors on the other hand in rainfed pastoral systems timing of fertiliser application in relation to the received rainfall and the current state of θ v can be crucial since untimely nutrient management can lead to nutrient loss and reduced amount of input taken up by plants beegle et al 2000 pasture growth rates are largely governed by soil water content therefore monitoring the temporal evolution of θ v serves a valuable part in land management practices and sufficient exploitation of the uncontrollable land resources scott et al 1985 shadbolt and martin 2005 temporal evolution of climate variables is presented on fig 10 including daily mean θ v computed by mc at 100 mm depth with standard deviation total daily rainfall daily mean near surface soil temperature obtained from 100 mm depth standard deviation and daily maximum 2 m air temperature prior to trend analysis the 15 min θ v readings were converted to daily time series of θ v and then the data obtained from 20 probes were averaged for each depth the probes have a built in compensation factor for correcting the effect of temperature thus the effectiveness of correction functions are not discussed in this paper the θ v monitoring started in the wet season nov 2016 which was followed by a drying out period for about 2 months in late january the soils began a rewetting stage leading towards near saturated conditions in july and the θ v levels remained high during the wintertime in the second half of october 2017 a rapid drying period occurred which was significantly more intense than in the previous year during the experiment 1111 2 mm rainfall was recorded by property s weather station showing an extremely heavy rainfall of 123 8 mm on 14 july 2017 the dynamic sensor response to the timing and magnitude of rainfall events drying cycles and the temporal trends of the climate variables were observed to be reasonable during the one year observation period it can be concluded that the sensors demonstrated stable response to changes in soil k a i e indirectly to θ v fluctuations making them reliable to use in non irrigated farm management as well as in irrigation scheduling the differences of the continuous data between mc and custom calibrations and the variation among the four depths are illustrated on fig 11 as it was expected the 100 mm near surface layer showed the highest rate of drying out process and the largest temporal variability of θ v ranging from 0 24 0 47 m3 m 3 if the sec method was applied the lowest temporal θ v variation was found in the deepest section of the observed soil profile giving a range of 0 29 0 42 m3 m 3 factory calibration and the custom calibration methods followed the same trend although the θ v variation and range among the 20 sites decreased downwards the soil profile sampling events were added to the timeline marked with dotted lines with the corresponding mean reference θ v so the temporal position of the collected gravimetric samples can be related to the evolution of θ v through the experiment period standard deviation was computed from the 20 composite samples at every sampling campaign for each depth overall the 100 mm reference measurements exceeded the greatest spatial variability whereas the reference set from 400 mm depth showed the smallest dispersion the interaction of numerous environmental parameters such as incoming solar radiation evapotranspiration precipitation and wind causes higher variation in the surface layers than deeper in the soil profile the comparison between mc and sec exhibited more significant differences in the top layer than in the deeper sections the mc approach presented underestimation over the entire observed timeframe at all depth although a reduced difference was observed during the dry seasons this result suggest that the measurement error tends to be larger when the θ v is close to field capacity while the sensor readings show closer agreement to reference θ v in dry conditions fc and sic showed very similar behaviour through the profile and the study period except at the shallowest depth where the wet season exerted the greatest differences in θ v between the mc and sec it was found that mc does not represent consistently the entire measurement range the difference between mc and sec began to increase at 0 33 m3 m 3 θ v levels especially in the 100 mm depth although better agreement was observed in the low θ v range 0 33 m3 m 3 the application of factory provided and custom calibration functions to the time series output of the probes resulted in a visually more sensible representation of the importance of using the custom calibration functions in case of irrigation scheduling the improved prediction of daily water content will improve water usage and optimise water management as well as reduce the amount of water leaching below the rootzone 3 4 effect of soil properties on sensor performance 3 4 1 raw sensor output dependence on clay content bulk density and total organic carbon content capacitance technique relies on the principle that θ v is the main influencing factor of the change in soil k a fig 12 a b and c present the sensor response at five predetermined s f levels with their corresponding reference θ v as a function of soil clay content ρ b and toc respectively reference θ v observations were selected corresponding to the s f output levels of 40 50 60 70 and 80 0 5 to explore the potential impact of the clay content ρ b and toc on the θ v readings at the 40 50 60 and 70 s f levels increasing clay content reflected lower reference θ v while the 80 s f level expressed the opposite trend a similar behaviour was observed for ρ b at the same s f categories however an a reversed trend occurred in the case of toc i e decreasing toc resulted in decreasing reference θ v at a given s f level fig 12c except at 80 s f that showed the opposite trend by the utilisation of the factory supplied conversion i e not depth specific calibration our interpretation would suggest that at 40 s f output the predicted θ v could fall anywhere between a relatively wide range of 0 27 0 17 m3 m 3 depending on ρ b or the amount of soil clay present in other words increasing clay content and ρ b can lead to increase in raw sensor outputs at the same θ v level dielectric sensors have been reported to overestimate θ v with increasing clay content rüdiger et al 2010 sharma et al 2017 parvin and degré 2016 reported increasing raw outputs for the layers with increasing clay content and ρ b in case of capacitance sensors in contrast to seyfried and murdock 2001 who observed that increased bound water i e increased clay content resulted in decreased ka hence lower raw output values in our study the former has been observed except in the very high θ v range i e at 80 s f level since the clay content and ρ b showed noticeable variation with soil depth at every site fig 2 the sec type is recommended to minimise these effects when aquacheck products are chosen under similar soil conditions 3 4 2 summary of the analysis of variance anova sensor errors were defined and computed as the difference between calibrated sensor readings and the reference θ v and used as input of the statistical analysis as a result of the two way factorial anova it was observed that soils clay content and the depth tend to have notable statistical effects on the sensor errors but their interaction is only significant on the 0 05 level table 3 since the soil texture including clay content and ρ b change with depth in a very similar manner fig 2 the combination of their influencing power may be reflected by the depth as a factor the correlation between the sensor errors and soil clay content showed a p value 0 001 and the soil depth exerted an important effect at the 0 001 level the interaction of clay content and the calibration method factor was defined to be significant with p value 0 001 the high importance of ρ b was also indicated by the anova giving a p value 0 001 calibration type and depth demonstrated strong influence on the sensor error distribution with a significant interaction between calibration method and ρ b at the 0 05 level according to the anova table soil clay content has statistically higher influencing power than the ρ b although they both represent the highest statistical significance category the soils toc content demonstrated strong impact on sensor errors p value 0 001 while the interaction effect between toc and soil depth was not significant p value of 0 55 in contrast the interaction between the calibration type and toc was found significant with p value 0 001 the two way interaction plots fig 13 display the clay content fig 13a ρ b fig 13b and toc fig 13c levels plotted against the mean of the θ v errors at each level for each calibration method the fitted regression lines with 95 confidence intervals helped to identify the differences caused by the factors considered the difference in the slopes of the linear functions indicates the rate of change thus the effect of clay content ρ b and toc is the most significant in the case of mc less important for fc hardly noticeable for sic and completely eliminated by the sec calibration furthermore low clay content and ρ b resulted in underestimation of θ v while increasing values of both variables showed overestimation when mc sic and fc were applied in contrast overestimation was observed with low toc content and greater toc values were associated with underestimation of θ v these findings represent defined influencing trends on sensor performance and error distribution fig 13 with increasing depth the ρ b also increased and it shifted the sensor errors towards the positive side meaning that overestimation of θ v could occur in soils with high ρ b and underestimation may be observed in soils with lower ρ b the slopes inflection points were found at 23 clay content and 1 27 gcm 3 ρ b dashed vertical lines respectively indicating the observed boundary between under and overestimation of θ v at the study sites interaction occurs mainly between mc fc sic and sec since the individually calibrated sensors acquired readings without sensitivity to the soil textural properties based on the results from anova and the generated graphs shown it is evident that the investigated soil physical properties have influencing power on the sensor readings which should be taken into consideration 4 conclusions we deployed and assessed capacitance based aquacheck subsurface multi sensor probes in terms of performance and accuracy in monitoring θ v at four depths and at 20 locations the 20 probes were organised into a wsn in order to collect high temporal resolution data from soils with varying physical properties on a hill country farm in the southern east coast of the north island of new zealand our results clearly indicate the need for at least farm specific calibration of the aquacheck sensors since the application of factory supplied formula for silt loam soils underestimated the true θ v mean rmse of 0 106 m3 m 3 these findings were supported by the significant effects of soil texture ρ b and toc p value 0 001 on the error distribution thus on the conversion of s f readings to θ v in the soil profile compared to direct thermo gravimetric θ v measurements the farm specific rmse of 0 039 m3 m 3 coefficient of determination of 0 58 r2 and site specific calibrations reduced the effect of the considered soil physical properties i e wetness clay content ρ b and toc resulting in a significant improvement in sensor measurement accuracy rmse of 0 029 m3 m 3 coefficient of determination of 0 77 r2 in terms of absolute error distribution positive errors were found in drier conditions θ v 0 28 0 35 m3 m 3 while negative errors were observed in the wetter soil stages if absolute errors are related to reference θ v to eliminate the impact of these physical parameters the sensor specific calibration approach is recommended rmse of 0 019 m3 m 3 coefficient of determination of 0 9 r2 that limited the absolute errors below 0 05 m3 m 3 the suggested calibration method is limited in that it requires soil samples to be taken at dry wet and intermediate θ v levels extending the time taken for this calibration procedure the results of our study provides a quantitative awareness concerning the precision level that can be achieved by different levels of calibration methods and the amount of fieldwork required therefore the paper aimed to provide valuable information and operational performance assessment for the application of the increasing number of aquacheck sensors being installed around the globe by taking into account the results of this study and the presented soil properties this type of sensor calibration may be applicable and useful for customers and researchers working with aquacheck sensors on variable landscapes with similar soil

applications however the performance of these sensors have not been investigated extensively under field conditions with dynamic soil moisture regimes for evaluation 20 probes 4 sensors unit were installed in predominantly silt loam soils on a pastoral hill country farm in the southern east coast of the north island of new zealand raw readings and θ v derived from a manufacturer recommended

the availability of soil information over all depths 100 to 400 mm the manufacturer calibration resulted in θ v readings with a mean rmse of 0 106 m3 m 3 a mean mbe of 0 099 m3 m 3 indicating underestimation and a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 58 when correlated to reference θ v values a single custom formula relevant to the local soils resulted in an improved rmse of 0 039 m3 m 3 and r2 0 58 while probe specific calibrations achieved an rmse of 0 029 m3 m 3 and r2 of 0 77 the application of sensor specific calibration resulted in an rmse of 0 019 m3 m 3 with r2 0 9 temporal

monitoring is rapidly developing across different types of soil plant systems over many landscape features at a time of increasing food demand and more intense agricultural drought events howell 2001

production matson et al 1997 irrigation management leib et al 2003 and nutrient cycling dougill et al 1998 at farm scale similarly it is essential for hydrological modelling western et al 2002 meteorological applications rowntree and bolton 1983 and flood risk evaluation massari et al 2014 at catchment scales soil water content controls the soil infiltration rate runoff and evapotranspiration influencing plant water availability that plays an essential role in precision agriculture as the single most important natural resource for pasture production rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 woodward et al 2001 due to the interaction of numerous environmental parameters soil water content is generally considered a both temporally and spatially highly changeable soil physical state variable although the spatial patterns have been observed to remain stable over time vachaud et al 1985 vanderlinden et al 2012 brocca et al 2017 soil water content predictability and variability are not yet fully understood especially near the surface and within the root zone these being the layers of interest for most applications wilson et al 2004 petropoulos et al 2014 root zone soil moisture is particularly useful for the evaluation of climate land surface and energy exchange models while in situ near surface soil moisture data is utilised in the validation and calibration of remotely sensed soil water products dorigo et al 2011 liu et al 2017 consequently obtaining accurate frequent and non destructive soil water data is significantly advantageous if not essential to facilitate improved yield and water management strategies in both irrigated and non irrigated farming systems several indirect methods measure a physico chemical property of the soil to estimate soil water content evett and parkin 2005 the radioactive technology and the idea of the neutron moisture metre published by gardner and kirkham 1952 induced a breakthrough in modern soil moisture estimation calibrated neutron moisture meters are able to achieve high soil moisture sensing accuracy although the technique is extremely costly and it poses special requirements for installation and operation the technique remained the standard until the age of dielectric sensors arrived in the 1980s ochsner et al 2013 since then a wide range of electromagnetic soil water content sensing devices have been developed robinson et al 2008 state of the art continuous soil water measurement techniques make use of the dielectric property of the sensed soil matrix lekshmi et al 2014 it has long been recognised that the measurement of the soils apparent dielectric constant k a can be directly related to volumetric soil water content θ v m3 m 3 sensitivity dean et al 1987 time domain reflectometry tdr frequency domain reflectometry fdr and capacitance techniques are the most common methods to obtain soil water content by emitting electromagnetic energy pulses into the soil the basics of tdr fdr and capacitance techniques for soil water measurement were established by topp et al 1980 and dean et al 1987 the techniques rely on the physical principle that water in soil pores has a significantly higher k a 81 at 20 c than air in soil pores 1 and higher than the typical mineral matrix of soils 3 12 dean et al 1987 noborio 2001 chandler et al 2004 the tdr method relates soil water content to the travel time of the electromagnetic signal along a transmission line since the propagation velocity of the electromagnetic energy impulse is mainly influenced by soil k a blonquist et al 2005 the generally expensive tdr sensors are commonly utilised as a reference bogena et al 2007 due to their high accuracy and good agreement with observations obtained by neutron scattering serrarens et al 2000 the fdr technique differs from tdr in that the former measures the variation of frequency of the returned electromagnetic pulses capacitance based sensing devices are based on the frequency domain although they make use of the charging time of the emitted electromagnetic field which is a function of soil k a mittelbach et al 2012 during measurement a capacitor system is formed by two or more electrodes metal rods spikes or rings inserted in the soil which serves as the dielectric an oscillator is often connected to the circuit this converts the changes in soil k a to the variation in the frequency of the transmitted signal between the electrodes leib et al 2003 lekshmi et al 2014 soil k a is influenced by factors other than soil water content such as variation in soil bulk density ρ b clay content temperature soil organic matter and salinity topp et al 1980 roth et al 1990 tsheko and savage 2005 the sensing volume of fdr and capacitance techniques is relatively small and the operating frequency is generally below 100 mhz therefore these sensors have been observed to be sensitive to clay content soil organic matter content air gaps temperature amount of iron minerals and ρ b robinson et al 1994 muñoz carpena et al 2004 dobriyal et al 2012 mittelbach et al 2012 visconti et al 2014 fares et al 2016 in an attempt to circumvent this calibrations provided by the manufacturer are generally developed under laboratory conditions by immersing the sensing units in solutions or in a soil medium with known parameters kizito et al 2008 capacitance sensors have been proven to be accurate for effective soil water monitoring for either scientific or agronomic purposes if a soil specific calibration is provided matula et al 2016 singh et al 2018 offering a significantly lower cost alternative to tdr evett 2000 mittelbach et al 2012 visconti et al 2014 however their accuracy and dependency on soil properties have not been investigated extensively under field conditions particularly not in new zealand on diverse hill country landscapes and soils aquacheck ltd has more than 20 000 probes installed in more than 20 countries around the world highlighting its key role among the industry s leading vendors in the rapidly growing global soil moisture sensor market space agri optics 2017 these numbers are expected to rise worldwide imposed by the increased pressure on sustainable agricultural productivity and the growing concern about climate soil health and conservation to date aquacheck sub surface sensor performance and the assessment of standard calibration functions have received little scientific attention although they have been employed in several studies cronje and mostert 2008 murungu et al 2011 aquacheck reported soil moisture data were compared to enviroscan readings chosen as reference by nolz 2013 however no comparisons were made against direct soil moisture measurements recently singh et al 2018 presented a detailed evaluation of a variety of electromagnetic sensors in a loam soil in nebraska u s including the aquacheck classic probe aquacheck readings were related in reference to field calibrated neutron moisture meter observations however their study had a short timeframe from 28 july to 6 september 2016 and a narrow soil water content range additionally the research was based on the statistical comparison of averaged soil moisture readings from two replicates at each of two selected depths separately and combined a criticism of the singh et al 2018 paper was published by schwartz et al 2018 questioning and commenting on the meaningfulness of the comparison between electromagnetic sensors and a neutron probe in the reply of rudnick et al 2018 the authors reviewed the results in singh et al 2018 and rejected the claim proposed in schwartz et al 2018 rudnick et al 2018 clearly stated that their approach intended to generate a scientific review of the sensors available for customers rather than a comprehensive comparison our study aims to evaluate the performance of 400 mm aquacheck sub surface multi sensor capacitance probes during a one year period under field conditions in silt loam and silty clay loam soils a comparison was made between sensor data collected from 20 spatially distributed probes and reference thermo gravimetric observations to achieve this aim our objectives are to 1 assess the manufacturer supplied calibration functions and establish new functions between raw sensor readings and reference observations to improve θ v sensing accuracy at multiple depths these custom calibrations will occur at three scales i e farm i e single calibration probe i e site specific 20 calibrations and sensor i e sensor specific 80 calibrations 2 investigate temporal θ v patterns and compare differences in accuracy between the custom calibration methods and the manufacturer provided calibrations that were most suitable for the soil type at the research area 3 provide aspects about measurement accuracy for sensor users to help decision making on whether the complete at sensor level calibration is necessary for their applications 4 determine the effect of selected soil properties and soil wetness on sensor error distribution our intent is to inform future deployment of capacitance based sensor probes for accurate predictions of multi depth θ v patterns on new zealand hill country soils or in regions with similar soil characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and soil characterisation the study was conducted on a 2600 ha hill country property patitapu station located in the wairarapa region of the north island of new zealand 40 745020 s 175 887320 e fig 1 the research site is primarily non irrigated pastoral farmland mixed with native bush on rolling to steep hills interspersed with fertile flat land sixty four year annual average rainfall is 1144 mm in this area with a range between 721 1735 mm niwa cliflo 1953 2017niwa cliflo 2017niwa cliflo 1953 2017 although precipitation is often localised in hill country elevation ranges from 143 to 531 m above sea level the soil water monitoring sites fig 1 were selected from pastoral areas on the farm where the predominant plant communities are ryegrass and clover species a permanent weather station 40 750032 s 175 887493 e was installed at the property from where rainfall and air temperature observations were collected to investigate sensor response to climatic variables the minimum maximum and mean distance between the climate monitoring station and sensing probes were 0 34 2 9 and 1 8 km respectively soil resource information was retrieved from the fundamental soil layers that describes the spatial pattern of soil types defined by the new zealand soil classification nzsc hewitt 2010 the majority of the property is covered by brown soils as it is illustrated on fig 1 at the group level a common soil in the east side of the north island the orthic brown bo soil dominates over the study site while patches of orthic gley go soils occur along the main water ways and firm brown bf soils can be found in the eastern side of the property with higher altitudes the topsoil is typically described as dark grey brown while the subsoil is often brown or yellow brown with generally well drained characteristics and fine texture 2 2 instrumentation and sensor data collection 2 2 1 aquacheck multi sensor probe specifications the capacitance based 400 mm aquacheck sub surface probe is a robust multi level device with four sensors spaced at intervals of 100 mm and with a right hollow cylindrical shaped sampling range the sphere of influence can be approximated with geometric parameters of h 60 mm cylinder height r 16 mm internal radius and r 20 45 mm external radius the probes are designed to be completely buried with an attached wire for data transmission to a logger fig 2 b the sensor transforms the frequency readings to scaled frequency s f as raw output the s f values range from 0 100 where 0 is equal to a reading in open air and 100 when the sensor is immersed in distilled water s f is calculated as follows 1 s f f a i r f s f a i r f a where f s is the frequency reading in the soil f a i r is the sensor frequency reading in air and f a is the sensor frequency reading in distilled water zettl et al 2015 the s f readings are automatically corrected for possible inherent temperature change by embedded compensation functions to calculate θ v s f values need to be converted using an empirical laboratory based calibration curve the conversion is not a built in function therefore the device is offered with factory calibration equations for six soil textures e g sand clay silt loam loam clay and generic composited from sand silt loam and clay soils agri optics 2017 the linear calibration equations provided by the manufacturer are in the form shown by equation 2 2 θ v b 0 b 1 s f where b 0 and b 1 are the y intercept and slope parameters of the generalised linear regression model and are dependent on the six determined soil textures for the purpose of this study the resulting θ v output was converted to θ v m3 m 3 2 2 2 wireless sensor network based data collection and monitoring site design at patitapu station a communication network utilising wireless sensor network wsn technology was deployed for the investigation of soil water distribution and temporal change in the root zone over a wide range of topographical positions on the farm the wsn architecture is composed of 20 multi sensor probes a gateway unit base station and connecting point to the cellular network and a repeater station arrayed in a mesh topology a typical example of a soil moisture monitoring site is shown on fig 2a each multi sensor probe was connected to robust long range telemetry units for logging and transmission of data via radio connection to the gateway each multi sensor probe was buried vertically fig 2b and placed approximately 4 m away from the radio unit with a connecting cable running through a sealed underground alkathene pipe manufacturer provided instructions were followed during the probe installation to avoid preferential water flow and air gaps as well as to ensure optimal sensor contact with the soil the interface board and battery recharged by a solar panel were placed in a weatherproof enclosure mounted on a galvanised pole along with a long range omnidirectional antenna fig 2a the halo farm system an online service developed by tag i t technologies ltd new zealand hamilton was used for web based data collection and management via cellular network the criteria associated with the research objectives and the farm management required the multi sensor probes to be buried this also provided equipment protection a two month period prior to the experiment was allowed for the sensors to equilibrate with the surrounding soil for the purpose of this study sensor readings were retrieved from the wsn database at the time closest to the time stamps of the sampling events at each site giving a maximum of 7 5 min of time difference between sensor reading and sampling there was no false or unusual reading in the analysis based on a comparison to the previous and the following three sensor readings 2 2 3 soil sampling the soil sampling events were carried out during dry θ v 0 25 m3 m 3 moderately wet θ v 0 35 m3 m 3 and wet θ v 0 45 m3 m 3 stages of θ v conditions over five sampling events on 21 11 2016 23 02 2017 24 04 2017 31 10 2017 and 18 11 2017 as marked on fig 10 during four sampling events the gravimetric samples were taken using a soil auger 5 cm approximately 0 6 0 8 m away from the multi sensor probe location avoiding the upper slope areas fig 3 a three soil cores were collected at each location and the cores divided into four depths 70 130 170 230 270 330 and 370 430 mm corresponding to the depth of the soil volume sampled by each sensor fig 3b the samples were immediately placed in sealed containers inside a cooling box and taken directly to the laboratory to be processed for one sampling event the three soil cores were kept separate to ascertain variability caused by the sampling method for the other three sampling events the samples were composited for each depth and treated as one sample in the laboratory one sampling event acquired samples with known volume for both ρ b and gravimetric water content measurements by opening two narrow 0 5 m deep pits approximately 0 4 m from the multi sensor probe fig 3a and c the gravimetric samples were obtained using 84 76 cm3 steel cylinders within which the soil material was retained for subsequent drying at 105 c for 24 h and analysis soil variability tends to be greater near the soil surface in hill country due to the interrelated effects of grazing livestock soil organic matter land use topsoil downslope movement rooting characteristics and the presence of soil organisms stavi et al 2008 chaudhari et al 2013 hence five replicates were taken from 100 mm depth while three replicates were obtained for all other depths mid points of the sampling depths corresponded to those of the sensing volume of each sensor sampling holes were subsequently infilled with soil from the same horizon preserving the compaction and order of soil layers as much as possible 2 2 4 soil description and soil texture in this study a laser scattering particle size distribution analysis was performed on composited samples three replicates at each depth using a horiba la 950 horiba scientific kyoto japan instrument to determine texture the diameter range of the individual particle size classes were defined by the u s department of agriculture usda gee and bauder 1986 and their size limits adopted in this analysis since it has been generally used in new zealand for texture analysis fig 4 a and b summarise the results from the particle size analysis grouped by depth along with the means and standard deviations of the ρ b values at each site most of the 300 and 400 mm soil increments exhibited fine textured silty clay loam characteristics with 25 and 28 average clay content respectively soil layers nearer the surface tend to fall in the silt loam class with increased proportions of sand fractions and less than 20 clay content increasing ρ b values were observed with increasing depth with a mean ρ b of 1 1 gcm 3 for 100 mm 1 22 gcm 3 for 200 mm 1 32 gcm 3 for 300 mm and 1 37 gcm 3 at 400 mm depth fig 4b apart from ρ b soil water holding properties are dependent on particle size distribution as well as total organic carbon content toc which are the main parameters in most pedotransfer functions that predicts field capacity saturation plant available water and permanent wilting point yang et al 2014 minasny and mcbratney 2018 thus toc values were derived for each sensing depth at each site by a dry combustion method using a vario macro cube chns elemental analyser elementar analysensysteme gmbh hanau germany the soil samples taken on 31 10 2017 were used for the analysis providing a dominantly decreasing trend in toc content with depth at most monitored locations the toc values ranged between 2 01 5 31 mean 3 48 at 100 mm 0 64 4 27 mean 2 13 at 200 mm 0 54 2 91 mean 1 32 at 300 mm and 0 52 2 39 mean 0 99 at 400 mm soil depth reference soil water content to obtain reference soil water content values soil samples were taken from multiple depths and the gravimetric water content θ g was measured by the standard gravimetric technique schmugge et al 1980 this approach has been most widely used for the determination of soil moisture lekshmi et al 2014 and is still the most accurate reference technique for custom calibration parvin and degré 2016 brocca et al 2017 for each individual sensor the laboratory θ g value was converted to θ v by multiplying by the mean ρ b value a wide range of θ v values 0 177 0 498 m3 m 3 was obtained from a total of 400 θ g measurements these θ v values were employed as the standard base for comparisons and are referred to as reference θ v in the following sections of the paper 2 3 calibration methods and sensor evaluation 2 3 1 custom calibration approach custom calibration was carried out at three levels of scale to provide options for users depending on their knowledge regarding the monitored soils a farm specific calibration fc used the entire dataset to provide a single linear relationship i e a single equation for the research area at the next level of detail monitoring site specific calibration sic formulas were developed to provide a linear calibration for each site probe 20 in total these calibrations ignored the change in soil properties with depth at the highest level of detail sec a custom calibration formula was determined for each depth for each sensor resulting in 80 individual calibration equations 2 3 2 statistical assessment of factory calibration and sensor accuracy in this study θ v values computed by various factory calibration formulas were compared the relationship between s f and reference θ v was analysed and sensor reported θ v determined by three custom calibration and factory supplied functions were related to reference θ v a simple linear regression approach was followed to investigate how s f and reference θ v were associated the assessment was performed for different subsets based on depth and calibration type to identify errors and model fit for each group for the evaluation of sensor accuracy and the applicability of factory calibration functions two primary statistical indicators were utilised i e the degree of coincidence and the degree of association the degree of coincidence was expressed by absolute accuracy error aae eq 3 mean bias error mbe eq 4 mean absolute error mae eq 5 and root mean square error rmse eq 6 to assess how well sensor measurements matched the reference water content values following the equations in willmott 1982 aae mbe mae and rmse are considered as best measures of overall accuracy reliability and model performance the simultaneous use of these metrics are often beneficial to assess model performance thus their customised forms are commonly applied in evaluation studies willmott 1982 chai and draxler 2014 the simplest measure aae was used to retrieve the magnitude of difference for each sample pair of sensor reported values and reference θ v aae is the most useful when individual data pairs are examined if the aae values are averaged over multiple measurements the mbe can be obtained that intends to measure average model bias the mbe value can convey information on the degree of overestimation positive or underestimation negative sheiner and beal 1981 when calibration methods are compared to each other or to the reference θ v measurements the linear score of mae was also calculated that measures accuracy by giving the average magnitude of the prediction errors regardless their direction and by weighing individual differences equally ideally θ v measurements are preferred within a certain threshold depending on applications and sensor type and large errors are not desirable therefore rmse was computed to penalise data pairs with large differences by giving them proportionally high weights the coefficient of determination r2 the square of the pearson correlation coefficient was selected as a measure of the degree of association indicating how well regression models can be fitted to raw sensor data calibrated datasets and to reference θ v data 3 a a e y s e n i y r e f i 4 m b e 1 n i 1 n y s e n i y r e f i 5 m a e 1 n i 1 n y s e n i y r e f i 6 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y s e n i y r e f i 2 where i is the data pair index n is the number of observations y s e n is the sensor data and y r e f is the reference θ v a general linear model approach two way factorial analysis of variance anova was chosen to test the effect of soil physical properties soil depth and calibration type on sensor response firstly sensor readings at five s f levels i e 40 50 60 70 80 0 5 and their corresponding reference θ v values were selected to examine whether the sensors would produce the same s f values if either the soil texture or ρ b was different secondly anova offers a statistical means of assessing the influencing power of a measured variable i e clay content ρ b on a dependent continuous variable i e sensor error in addition to a secondary categorical variable i e depth calibration method that contain a finite number of categories the influencing power of soil properties was expressed by statistical significance p value and mean measurement error it is assumed that the measured soil variables have not been controlled by the experiment but are considered to influence sensor performance it is also assumed that the relationship between the measured soil properties and the sensor errors are linear based on previous findings regarding electromagnetic sensors types varble and chávez 2011 parvin and degré 2016 to help visualising these relationships interaction plots are commonly used to analyse the interaction between categorical variables and a continuous response depending on the value of another factor calibration method for example the effect of clay content and ρ b on sensor error was visualised by displaying the levels of clay content ρ b on the x axis with the means of the continuous variable for each factor level on the y axis both anova related analyses were conducted using the r statistical software version 3 4 1 r core team 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of manufacturer provided formulas the sensors measured s f was converted to θ v by the factory provided conversion equations and compared to 400 80 samples per sampling event corresponding reference θ v while the soils at the monitoring sites are mainly silt loam or silty clay loam five conversion formulas were selected for comparison table 1 provides a depthwise summary about the statistical measures of the various factory supplied calibration due to the linear nature of the factory calibration r2 values varied only with depth giving a range of 0 74 0 49 through the observed soil profile during the examination of the manufacturer calibration functions the closest agreement with reference θ v was achieved by the loam soil specific factory calibration performing slightly better than the clay soil formula the loam calibration resulted in a range of 0 038 0 043 m3 m 3 for rmse between the reference θ v and the sensor reported θ v across all depths providing the best overall accuracy the generic and clay loam calibration functions did not perform well providing very similar error levels with 0 071 0 109 m3 m 3 rmse the loam type of factory calibration resulted in 0 163 m3 m 3 root mean squared difference in loamy soils in comparison to neutron scattering observations according to singh et al 2018 which also highlights the uncertainty in the manufacturer calibrations and the need for soil or site specific formulas the silt loam type of conversion significantly underestimated the θ v giving 0 0985 m3 m 3 of mbe and rmse between 0 095 0 125 m3 m 3 depending on depth in comparison with the other four texture specific methods the silt loam calibration showed the largest underestimation of the true θ v the assessment also showed generally higher error values in the top half of the profile than in the deeper sections regardless of the calibration method which was also observed by nolz 2013 when comparing aquacheck readings to enviroscan estimations similar trends were reported by mittelbach et al 2012 during an evaluation of low cost sensors to tdr measurements on loam and clay loam soils in switzerland taking into consideration the soil textural properties found at the majority of the monitoring sites users would apply the silt loam specific equation to compute θ v for their applications therefore the silt loam formula was selected and referred to as manufacturer calibration mc in the further analysis and various comparisons 3 2 regression calibration 3 2 1 relating raw sensor readings to reference volumetric water content raw sensor outputs as a function of true θ v were analysed by fitting a linear model on s f and reference θ v the relationship between s f and reference θ v demonstrated significant positive linear correlations at every depth fig 5 a however the slope and intercept of the fitted models differed for the various soil depth intervals fig 5b the linear regression explained 58 of the variability on the entire dataset and 74 57 54 and 58 at 100 200 300 400 mm depth respectively since the correlation between raw aquacheck s f and reference θ v was characterised as positive moderate r2 between 0 5 0 7 and strong r2 0 7 a linear regression calibration approach was followed to develop custom calibration functions to improve the precision of θ v predictions at different sites and depths on the study farm since there is a saturation or plateau effect at the extremely wet end of the soil θ v range fig 10 a more complex model fit seems desirable for these conditions a laboratory based calibration process on site specific soil samples could potentially improve the model fit between raw s f readings and high resolution reference θ v covering the entire sensing range and lead to the development of non linear models considering the linear regression approach followed by the manufacturer and the main objectives of the study the linear calibration method seemed to be the most practical statistical approach that could be easily reproduced by individuals not belonging to the scientific community 3 2 2 development of the custom calibration functions and model fit analysis fig 6 presents the steps and results of an example how sic fig 6a and sec fig 6b equations were developed at a selected soil monitoring site namely site 9 notice mc fc and sic methods use only one single equation for each probe at a particular location the sic model was fitted on reference θ v and s f readings obtained from all four depths containing 20 data pair at each site the sec formula was generated from five data pair for every individual sensor as a final step θ v computed by mc fc sic sec were compared and correlated to the reference θ v to assess the difference in the converted θ v by various calibration functions fig 6c and d the general trend given by the reference θ v was followed by both the mc and the custom calibration formulas fig 6c although it is clearly indicated that the custom linear regression coefficients are able to offer a better agreement between the sensor predictions and the reference θ v fig 6d plots the model fits after calibration where sec method evidently demonstrated an improved 0 89 r2 as opposed to the 0 64 r2 given by the other three calibration methods the calibration process and the computation of r2 values were completed on every site at each depth for the four calibration methods fig 7 a summarises the results grouped by the methods and fig 7b presents the statistical distribution of r2 at each depth the correlations between the sensor predictions and the reference θ v obtained at the four soil depths fig 7b were significantly different indicating that one calibration formula for one monitoring site might not be sufficient thus sec for each soil depth may be used for applications where high accuracy is required the model fit for the 100 mm soil depth produced the highest mean r2 of 0 91 and the 400 mm soil depth demonstrated the lowest 0 70 r2 while 200 and 300 mm depth intervals performed similarly well giving 0 8 and 0 77 of r2 in terms of calibration methods sec method with 0 86 mean r2 demonstrated considerably better fit than the mc fc and sic methods showing mean r2 of 0 66 each 3 2 3 custom calibration accuracy and error assessment to investigate the improvement in accuracy θ v values calculated by mc fc sic and sec were correlated to reference θ v data and the change was examined both on the entire dataset fig 8 a and at each depth fig 8b the custom regression calibrations fc sic and sec led to substantial improvement in terms of accuracy of θ v prediction considering the entire dataset the overall regression developed for fc resulted in appreciable improvement compared to the mc method the sic method resulted in rmse of 0 029 m3 m 3 compared to 0 039 m3 m 3 for fc and 0 106 m3 m 3 if the mc approach was utilised the best performance was achieved by the sec formulas with mean rmse of 0 019 m3 m 3 table 2 the mae ranged from 0 09 0 118 0 025 0 039 0 019 0 029 and 0 013 0 019 m3 m 3 for mc fc sic and sec respectively meaning that the absolute error and the error range through four depths were reduced by moving towards the calibration at the sensor level mbe varied between 0 089 0 118 for mc 0 021 0 007 for fc 0 016 0 027 for sic and gave 0 000 m3 m 3 for sec suggesting that θ v obtained by mc considerably underestimated the gravimetrically measured reference θ v sec was able to remove the presence of systematic over or underestimation as the errors cancelled out table 2 these results show that even a single farm specific calibration will perform better than the universal factory formulas if the sensors are used in precision agriculture applications a sec calibration will produce accuracy beyond the single fc and sic calibration making perceivable difference on the long run in irrigation scheduling furthermore fertiliser applications are strongly dependent on the right amount of θ v monaghan et al 2007 ma and herath 2016 thus more precise timing of inputs at least matter of days can be chosen by using the most detailed sec method however the distribution of errors in relation to reference θ v was not uniform the pattern of error distributions was examined by the correlation of reference θ v and the calculated aae for each custom and mc methods as plotted in fig 9 to describe θ v conditions during the five sampling events the frequency distribution of reference θ v was displayed in the bottom of fig 9 for each depth the histograms clearly demonstrate the wider range and higher variability of reference θ v in the surface than in the deeper sections at the 300 and 400 mm depths the shape of the data is slightly skewed to the left showing that the deeper part of the soil profile was usually wetter than the surface on the date of sampling events in the upper section of fig 9 normal confidence ellipsoids were added to the scatter plot matrix with 95 confidence level as a graphical representation of correlation between aae and reference θ v friendly et al 2013 at every depth the ellipsoids are stretched out diagonally from top left to bottom right indicating negative linear correlation the analysis revealed that sensor readings tend to overestimate the true θ v at drier soil conditions θ v 0 28 0 35 m3 m 3 depending on the depth and calibration type on the other hand underestimation occurred during the wetter soil stages the largest aae increased to 0 012 m3 m 3 if fc and to 0 009 m3 m 3 if sic method was applied at 100 mm depth the fc and sic methods led to considerably reduced errors sic being more accurate than fc at every depth level in general the lowest aae was observed if sec calibration was used with less significant correlation while the largest absolute differences were given by the mc sec was able to limit the aae to around 0 05 m3 m 3 for most observations at all depths the more elongated ellipses in the 100 200 mm depths suggest higher correlation r2 of 0 56 for fc 0 5 for mc 0 30 for sic and 0 05 for sec at 100 mm than the less elongated nearly circular shaped ellipsoids for the deeper parts of the monitored soil profile r2 of 0 26 for fc 0 21 for mc 0 1 for sic and 0 13 for sec at 400 mm r2 typically decreased as the scale of the calibration moved from fc towards the sec suggesting improvement and less sensitivity to high and low moisture conditions these results depict that the effect can be minimised by calibration at the probe or sensor level thus underestimation and overestimation can be diminished in comparison with mc furthermore mittelbach et al 2011 and mittelbach et al 2012 found similar aae trends for capacitance and fdr based sensors who also emphasised the importance of site specific calibration and the sensitivity to soil types that agree with the findings of this study a sensor specific calibration might be an ideal option when the soils have variable physical properties within the monitored profile the collected and analysed data indicates that the aquacheck sensors can be effectively field calibrated using direct gravimetric measurements consequently the new calibration coefficients developed in this study could be used for soils with similar textural properties the key findings of this study is supported by other field based evaluation experiments stating that root mean square difference values dropped significantly when site specific or sensor specific equations were applied rudnick and irmak 2014 singh et al 2018 the generated custom calibration functions are expected to carry robust representations of accurate soil water measurements since a wide spectrum of θ v were used for the analysis along with sensor reported data acquired from 20 replicates therefore the wsn deployed at patitapu station can be applied to validate soil moisture products from other sources such as remote sensing 3 3 prediction of soil water temporal trends exploring the long term behaviour of sensor response and general probe reliability through a time series based comparison is of great importance since it can reveal hysteresis effects reliability issues technical problems and variation in measurement accuracy it also highlights the relevance of soil or site specific calibration development in capturing moisture sorption and desorption especially when irrigation scheduling is guided by real time soil water data from in situ sensors on the other hand in rainfed pastoral systems timing of fertiliser application in relation to the received rainfall and the current state of θ v can be crucial since untimely nutrient management can lead to nutrient loss and reduced amount of input taken up by plants beegle et al 2000 pasture growth rates are largely governed by soil water content therefore monitoring the temporal evolution of θ v serves a valuable part in land management practices and sufficient exploitation of the uncontrollable land resources scott et al 1985 shadbolt and martin 2005 temporal evolution of climate variables is presented on fig 10 including daily mean θ v computed by mc at 100 mm depth with standard deviation total daily rainfall daily mean near surface soil temperature obtained from 100 mm depth standard deviation and daily maximum 2 m air temperature prior to trend analysis the 15 min θ v readings were converted to daily time series of θ v and then the data obtained from 20 probes were averaged for each depth the probes have a built in compensation factor for correcting the effect of temperature thus the effectiveness of correction functions are not discussed in this paper the θ v monitoring started in the wet season nov 2016 which was followed by a drying out period for about 2 months in late january the soils began a rewetting stage leading towards near saturated conditions in july and the θ v levels remained high during the wintertime in the second half of october 2017 a rapid drying period occurred which was significantly more intense than in the previous year during the experiment 1111 2 mm rainfall was recorded by property s weather station showing an extremely heavy rainfall of 123 8 mm on 14 july 2017 the dynamic sensor response to the timing and magnitude of rainfall events drying cycles and the temporal trends of the climate variables were observed to be reasonable during the one year observation period it can be concluded that the sensors demonstrated stable response to changes in soil k a i e indirectly to θ v fluctuations making them reliable to use in non irrigated farm management as well as in irrigation scheduling the differences of the continuous data between mc and custom calibrations and the variation among the four depths are illustrated on fig 11 as it was expected the 100 mm near surface layer showed the highest rate of drying out process and the largest temporal variability of θ v ranging from 0 24 0 47 m3 m 3 if the sec method was applied the lowest temporal θ v variation was found in the deepest section of the observed soil profile giving a range of 0 29 0 42 m3 m 3 factory calibration and the custom calibration methods followed the same trend although the θ v variation and range among the 20 sites decreased downwards the soil profile sampling events were added to the timeline marked with dotted lines with the corresponding mean reference θ v so the temporal position of the collected gravimetric samples can be related to the evolution of θ v through the experiment period standard deviation was computed from the 20 composite samples at every sampling campaign for each depth overall the 100 mm reference measurements exceeded the greatest spatial variability whereas the reference set from 400 mm depth showed the smallest dispersion the interaction of numerous environmental parameters such as incoming solar radiation evapotranspiration precipitation and wind causes higher variation in the surface layers than deeper in the soil profile the comparison between mc and sec exhibited more significant differences in the top layer than in the deeper sections the mc approach presented underestimation over the entire observed timeframe at all depth although a reduced difference was observed during the dry seasons this result suggest that the measurement error tends to be larger when the θ v is close to field capacity while the sensor readings show closer agreement to reference θ v in dry conditions fc and sic showed very similar behaviour through the profile and the study period except at the shallowest depth where the wet season exerted the greatest differences in θ v between the mc and sec it was found that mc does not represent consistently the entire measurement range the difference between mc and sec began to increase at 0 33 m3 m 3 θ v levels especially in the 100 mm depth although better agreement was observed in the low θ v range 0 33 m3 m 3 the application of factory provided and custom calibration functions to the time series output of the probes resulted in a visually more sensible representation of the importance of using the custom calibration functions in case of irrigation scheduling the improved prediction of daily water content will improve water usage and optimise water management as well as reduce the amount of water leaching below the rootzone 3 4 effect of soil properties on sensor performance 3 4 1 raw sensor output dependence on clay content bulk density and total organic carbon content capacitance technique relies on the principle that θ v is the main influencing factor of the change in soil k a fig 12 a b and c present the sensor response at five predetermined s f levels with their corresponding reference θ v as a function of soil clay content ρ b and toc respectively reference θ v observations were selected corresponding to the s f output levels of 40 50 60 70 and 80 0 5 to explore the potential impact of the clay content ρ b and toc on the θ v readings at the 40 50 60 and 70 s f levels increasing clay content reflected lower reference θ v while the 80 s f level expressed the opposite trend a similar behaviour was observed for ρ b at the same s f categories however an a reversed trend occurred in the case of toc i e decreasing toc resulted in decreasing reference θ v at a given s f level fig 12c except at 80 s f that showed the opposite trend by the utilisation of the factory supplied conversion i e not depth specific calibration our interpretation would suggest that at 40 s f output the predicted θ v could fall anywhere between a relatively wide range of 0 27 0 17 m3 m 3 depending on ρ b or the amount of soil clay present in other words increasing clay content and ρ b can lead to increase in raw sensor outputs at the same θ v level dielectric sensors have been reported to overestimate θ v with increasing clay content rüdiger et al 2010 sharma et al 2017 parvin and degré 2016 reported increasing raw outputs for the layers with increasing clay content and ρ b in case of capacitance sensors in contrast to seyfried and murdock 2001 who observed that increased bound water i e increased clay content resulted in decreased ka hence lower raw output values in our study the former has been observed except in the very high θ v range i e at 80 s f level since the clay content and ρ b showed noticeable variation with soil depth at every site fig 2 the sec type is recommended to minimise these effects when aquacheck products are chosen under similar soil conditions 3 4 2 summary of the analysis of variance anova sensor errors were defined and computed as the difference between calibrated sensor readings and the reference θ v and used as input of the statistical analysis as a result of the two way factorial anova it was observed that soils clay content and the depth tend to have notable statistical effects on the sensor errors but their interaction is only significant on the 0 05 level table 3 since the soil texture including clay content and ρ b change with depth in a very similar manner fig 2 the combination of their influencing power may be reflected by the depth as a factor the correlation between the sensor errors and soil clay content showed a p value 0 001 and the soil depth exerted an important effect at the 0 001 level the interaction of clay content and the calibration method factor was defined to be significant with p value 0 001 the high importance of ρ b was also indicated by the anova giving a p value 0 001 calibration type and depth demonstrated strong influence on the sensor error distribution with a significant interaction between calibration method and ρ b at the 0 05 level according to the anova table soil clay content has statistically higher influencing power than the ρ b although they both represent the highest statistical significance category the soils toc content demonstrated strong impact on sensor errors p value 0 001 while the interaction effect between toc and soil depth was not significant p value of 0 55 in contrast the interaction between the calibration type and toc was found significant with p value 0 001 the two way interaction plots fig 13 display the clay content fig 13a ρ b fig 13b and toc fig 13c levels plotted against the mean of the θ v errors at each level for each calibration method the fitted regression lines with 95 confidence intervals helped to identify the differences caused by the factors considered the difference in the slopes of the linear functions indicates the rate of change thus the effect of clay content ρ b and toc is the most significant in the case of mc less important for fc hardly noticeable for sic and completely eliminated by the sec calibration furthermore low clay content and ρ b resulted in underestimation of θ v while increasing values of both variables showed overestimation when mc sic and fc were applied in contrast overestimation was observed with low toc content and greater toc values were associated with underestimation of θ v these findings represent defined influencing trends on sensor performance and error distribution fig 13 with increasing depth the ρ b also increased and it shifted the sensor errors towards the positive side meaning that overestimation of θ v could occur in soils with high ρ b and underestimation may be observed in soils with lower ρ b the slopes inflection points were found at 23 clay content and 1 27 gcm 3 ρ b dashed vertical lines respectively indicating the observed boundary between under and overestimation of θ v at the study sites interaction occurs mainly between mc fc sic and sec since the individually calibrated sensors acquired readings without sensitivity to the soil textural properties based on the results from anova and the generated graphs shown it is evident that the investigated soil physical properties have influencing power on the sensor readings which should be taken into consideration 4 conclusions we deployed and assessed capacitance based aquacheck subsurface multi sensor probes in terms of performance and accuracy in monitoring θ v at four depths and at 20 locations the 20 probes were organised into a wsn in order to collect high temporal resolution data from soils with varying physical properties on a hill country farm in the southern east coast of the north island of new zealand our results clearly indicate the need for at least farm specific calibration of the aquacheck sensors since the application of factory supplied formula for silt loam soils underestimated the true θ v mean rmse of 0 106 m3 m 3 these findings were supported by the significant effects of soil texture ρ b and toc p value 0 001 on the error distribution thus on the conversion of s f readings to θ v in the soil profile compared to direct thermo gravimetric θ v measurements the farm specific rmse of 0 039 m3 m 3 coefficient of determination of 0 58 r2 and site specific calibrations reduced the effect of the considered soil physical properties i e wetness clay content ρ b and toc resulting in a significant improvement in sensor measurement accuracy rmse of 0 029 m3 m 3 coefficient of determination of 0 77 r2 in terms of absolute error distribution positive errors were found in drier conditions θ v 0 28 0 35 m3 m 3 while negative errors were observed in the wetter soil stages if absolute errors are related to reference θ v to eliminate the impact of these physical parameters the sensor specific calibration approach is recommended rmse of 0 019 m3 m 3 coefficient of determination of 0 9 r2 that limited the absolute errors below 0 05 m3 m 3 the suggested calibration method is limited in that it requires soil samples to be taken at dry wet and intermediate θ v levels extending the time taken for this calibration procedure the results of our study provides a quantitative awareness concerning the precision level that can be achieved by different levels of calibration methods and the amount of fieldwork required therefore the paper aimed to provide valuable information and operational performance assessment for the application of the increasing number of aquacheck sensors being installed around the globe by taking into account the results of this study and the presented soil properties this type of sensor calibration may be applicable and useful for customers and researchers working with aquacheck sensors on variable landscapes with similar soil

11088,coupling crop growth models and remote sensing data has shown great potential to improve crop yield and biomass forecasting however few such applications are used at field level in this study the plug in version of aquacrop a water driven model initially designed for conditions in which water is the limiting factor in crop production was adapted to assess maize in belgium field campaigns were organised in 2015 2016 and 2017 during which ground measurements were collected at field level and under rainfed conditions above ground total dry biomass and field management information crop density planting dates biomass measurements etc was collected green fractional vegetation cover fcover data were retrieved from high spatial and temporal satellite images dmc 2 deimos 1 and sentinel 2 maximum canopy cover and emergence date were derived from the time series and assimilated into aquacrop the model was calibrated with the 2015 2016 dataset and validated with 2017 data the root mean square error rmse for the biomass assessment was 0 7 ton ha and the r² reached 0 85 the r² between the canopy cover simulated by the model and the remotely sensed fcover ranged from 0 76 0 98 in most of the cases to simultaneously run and evaluate the ensemble of field level simulations a semi automated r environment was developed this robust and automated approach offers vast potential for large scale field level yield assessments for temperate as well as tropical conditions keywords aquacrop model remote sensing data integration semi automatic approach maize belgium 1 introduction crop yield and total biomass assessment is vital for human well being with regards to agriculture activities such as productivity management traditional yield and biomass estimation is usually carried out through either field sampling measurements or agro meteorological modelling wellens et al 2017b however field measurements are often costly and time consuming moreover the accuracy of the agrometeorological models is not always sufficient for operational purposes for an efficient crop biomass or yield prediction integrating remotely sensed data into a crop growth model has great advantages when compared to traditional methods ma et al 2013 several previous studies have illustrated the positive influence of data integration into different crop growth models on yield or biomass estimation using different methods over various crop curnel et al 2011 dente et al 2008 guerif and duke 2000 launay and guerif 2005 zhao et al 2013 a large number of crop growth models have been developed by the scientific community dssat jones et al 2003 and wofost diepen et al 1989 crop models are the most well known depending on their complexity the largest disadvantage of these models is the requirement for a huge amount of input data and parameters van gaelen et al 2015 the fao s aquacrop model raes et al 2009 however stands out by its simplicity accuracy robustness and the requirement for a relatively small number of input parameters the model has been tested in different conditions for several crops cabbage rice wheat maize teff etc in several locations abedinpour et al 2012 akumaga et al 2017 hussein et al 2011 wellens et al 2013 however model prediction can be improved by using remote sensing data remote sensing technology is able to quantitatively depict crop growth conditions at different scales and reflect the impact of environmental factors on crop growth and development remote sensing information can reflect the actual crop growth and development and provide an objective observation of crop growth conditions since the rapid development and availability of products with different spatial and temporal resolutions the integration of remote sensing data into crop growth models has increased in recent years linker and ioslovich 2017 have successfully shown the possibility of assimilating ground measured canopy cover data using digital images above the canopy during the growing season within the aquacrop model for potato and cotton based on the extended kalman filter algorithm however this innovative procedure requires field data collection during the season which is budget and time consuming but today it can be facilitated and improved using earth observation data especially from sentinel 2 satellite sensors whose temporal and spatial resolution is adapted for parcel monitoring jin et al 2016 used spectral based biomass values computed with on field spectral measurement data to calibrate the aquacrop model with a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm for winter wheat in china the same pso algorithm was used for winter wheat by silvestro et al 2017 and jin et al 2017 to assimilate optical and radar satellite data into the aquacrop model several coupling methods have been categorised and detailed by delécolle et al 1992 and jin et al 2018 one of these methods is by substituting crop growth models variables with remotely sensed data modelling results can then be tuned in line with observed results by readjusting model parameters or reparametrizing the crop growth model zhao et al 2013 a similar approach using remote sensing coarse resolution data was used to calibrate the aquacrop model with the leaf area index from modis for winter wheat in italy by trombetta et al 2016 it was only applied to large agricultural parcels due to modis s limited spatial resolution the main objective of this study is to couple high temporal and spatial resolution remote sensing data and an agrometeorological crop model aquacrop to estimate maize growth and total above ground dry biomass at parcel level in belgium for these purposes the standalone aquacrop plug in was embedded in an r environment team 2014 to semi automatically run field simulations and assess the results the specific objectives consist of i acquire process and smooth using swets algorithm satellite time series data dmc 2 deimos 1 and sentinel 2 ii retrieve maximum canopy cover and emergence date from the smoothed time series iii ingest field specific data into the aquacrop model since aquacrop was not calibrated for such a purpose for maize in belgium calibration work was conducted simultaneously with data integration on the 2015 and 2016 datasets to fix model parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 field data throughout 2015 2016 and 2017 maize fields were monitored at different degrees of intensity fields were selected based on several criteria the location of experimental fields is shown in fig 1 each field should not be smaller than 2 ha and field width must exceed 80 m to include enough pixels only one cultivar must be sown per field a total of 40 maize fields were monitored over 3 years detailed information about the fields is given in table 1 a sampling approach proposed by centre indépendant de promotion fourragère cipf and based on their experience and practical knowledge was used in the present study the biomass samples were collected at harvest for each field a total number of three maize rows of 3 4 m length were harvested the samples were collected at different locations on the fields considering an inner buffer of 6 m from the field boundaries to avoid edge effects a lateral distance of at least 10 m depending on the field size separated the extremities of the harvested rows each sampling row consisted of approximately 21 27 plants which formed a batch each batch was shredded separately and mixed homogeneously then sub biomass particles of nearly 1 kg for each batch were oven dried at 70 c for a time frame of 72 h and finally the dry matter content was calculated for a given parcel the average dry matter content of the three batches was considered the biomass was extrapolated to 1 ha table 2 summarises the statistics of biomass data due to a communication issue three parcels were harvested before sampling farmers were invited to deliver additional information on management practices e g plant densities planting and harvest dates fertiliser applications type date and amount and observations of extreme events water stress water logging pests and diseases all monitored fields were under rainfed conditions 2 2 crop model description 2 2 1 aquacrop the aquacrop model predicts crops yield and biomass as a response to water under rainfed deficit or full irrigation conditions after separating the evapotranspiration into i crop transpiration tr which is the amount of water taken by the roots and used for the crop metabolism and ii soil evaporation which is the amount of water lost through the atmosphere biomass b growth is simulated through its assumed linear relationship with crop transpiration tr this separation avoids the confounding effect of the non productive consumptive use of water more details on the model description are available in steduto et al 2009 and raes et al 2009 a water productivity wp parameter converts the actual crop transpiration into biomass for a given time and climate condition the biomass is the result of wp and accumulated transpiration eq 1 de wit 1958 hanks 1983 steduto et al 2009 1 b w p σ t r 2 w p b σ t r e t o 3 y h i b the wp is a crop specific parameter defining the amount of produced biomass per unit of consumed water if normalised for evapotranspiration eq 2 it remains virtually constant over a range of environments steduto et al 2007 which makes aquacrop applicable across diverse locations and seasons wp represents the normalised water productivity for most crops only part of the biomass produced is considered harvestable this harvestable yield y is the product of the harvest index hi also a crop specific parameter and biomass b eq 3 no intermediary hierarchical or physiological processes are considered in the biomass growth simulation as a result the model remains simple and robust requiring only a limited number of input parameters steduto et al 2009 furthermore crop transpiration and hence also crop development are driven by the more straightforward canopy ground cover cc fractional coverage of green cover per unit of soil instead of the usual leaf area index lai two kinds of parameters are differentiated in aquacrop i fixed or conservative and ii case specific or non conservative parameters conservative parameters are not influenced by geography field management or time and remain constant for different cultivars and agrometeorological conditions steduto et al 2012 they are obtained under non limiting growing conditions and remain applicable in cases of stress thanks to the necessary stress response functions raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 the main conservative parameters are canopy growth cgc and canopy decline cdc coefficients full canopy crop transpiration coefficient kc biomass wp and soil water depletion thresholds other crop parameters are case specific and non conservative e g sowing density length of phenological stages and influenced by climate field management practices and soil type they must be provided for each specific case or can if needed be estimated by the model raes et al 2012 2009 the aquacrop database already comes with a default set of calibrated crop files and research results on supplemental crops are widely available in the literature 2 2 2 aquacrop plug in acsav50 identical to the standard program the aquacrop plug in program uses the same calculation procedures but as a stand alone executable version 5 0 of the plug in was used in time calendar setting when run the program generates and executes a list of projects containing all required simulation information and results are stored in output files wellens et al 2017a the plug in program is intended for external applications with iterative or large numbers of simulations lorite et al 2013 2 3 meteorological and soil data soil data were retrieved from the belgian crop growth monitoring system b cgms soil map de wit et al 2012 a sub set version of the 1 1 000 000 soil geographical database of europe lambert et al 2003 the available soil characteristics were water content at saturation at field capacity and at wilting and saturated hydraulic conductivity since aquacrop is a water driven crop model this information perfectly suited the water balance calculations meteorological data for belgium were received daily by ftp transfer from the royal meteorological institute based on 125 weather stations an interpolation grid with 10 km 10 km grid cells was elaboration by van der voet et al 1994 the used daily climate data included minimum and maximum temperature relative humidity evapotranspiration and precipitation 2 4 model embedded r environment for this study a tool was developed in an r environment fig 2 this tool integrated the aquacrop plug in in a database containing the soil map of belgium and its physical parameters meteorological data a calibrated maize crop file and provided by farmers information on field management practices i e date of sowing plant density etc r scripts were developed to pick up the required data launch the aquacrop plug in executable and read out the simulation results this approach considerably improved crop file assessments now with a single run a multitude of fields were assessed the results gave a per field and overall evaluation of the simulations 2 5 crop data and model calibration vanuytrecht 2013 calibrated and validated the aquacrop model using a limited set of fields and focused mainly on the impact of climate change on yield those existing crop files served as a basis to calibrate and validate aquacrop with the current dataset model calibration consisted in revising crop and model parameters based on satellite measurement and literature in order to obtain accurate simulations versus observation two major steps were necessary for calibration canopy cover simulation is a crucial first step andarzian et al 2011 main canopy cover calibration parameters are cgc cdc and stress indices affecting leaf expansion and early senescence the effect of soil fertility was not considered as it was not a limiting factor since sufficient amounts of nutrients were added on all the monitored fields cgc and cdc were iteratively calibrated using a trial error approach until the minimum root mean square error rmse and the highest coefficient of determination r² were obtained between simulated canopy cover and cleaned see 2 7 2 time series cleaning satellite data at acquisition dates moreover the results were evaluated by graphical inspection comparing daily simulated canopy cover and daily interpolated satellite derived data however only the statistical metrics guided the calibration the graphical evaluation was given as an overview after calibrating canopy cover related parameters wp was re adjusted by comparing simulated and observed final above ground dry total biomass using the same approach as for canopy cover related parameters biomass data throughout the growing season were not available the entire dataset was divided in two parts according to the year of acquisition the first dataset composed of 2015 and 2016 data was used for calibration during which parameters were adjusted the 2017 dataset was used for the validation using the parameters fixed at the calibration 2 6 assimilation procedure detailed review of remote sensing data assimilation in crop models has been provided by jin et al 2018 in the present study a continuous assimilation strategy was applied on canopy cover related parameters the assimilation was performed on both calibration and validation datasets only during calibration are modelling results tuned in line with the observed results by adjusting the initial conditions or readjusting model parameters as canopy expansion expresses crop development it is assumed that maximum canopy cover provides indirectly useful information about the state of the crop at flowering stage water stress soil fertility and salinity stress hamper canopy development and result in a lower maximum canopy cover providing this information can therefore improve the crop modelling hence assimilation concentrated firstly on retrieving each field s maximum canopy cover from the satellite canopy cover time series and integrating that value into the processing chain by updating the model value the time from sowing to emergence is another important parameter in crop growth simulation raes et al 2009 since this information triggers the start of the simulation when badly defined a gap between the actual crop cycle and the simulated cycle is observed the second assimilation consisted therefore in updating the model emergence dates with emergence dates derived from the satellite canopy cover time series this allowed to match the satellite observed with the simulated growing cycle for each field the step by step approach was especially important to calibration as it facilitated the parameters settings for validation the assimilation of maximum canopy cover and the emergence date was done directly using the calibrated crop file 2 7 satellite data a time series of 17 commercial dmc 2 deimos 1 images with maximum cloud cover percentage of 30 was acquired over belgium between 8 march and 11 october 2015 to cover the first field campaign dmc 2 deimos 1 sensors provide three spectral bands in the green red and nir near infrared ranges with 650 625 km swath and a spatial resolution of 22 m for the last two field campaigns freely available sentinel 2 images were used sentinel 2 data are acquired on 13 spectral bands in the vnir visible and near infrared and swir short wave infrared range of which four bands at 10 m resolution blue green red and nir six bands at 20 m three red edge bands a narrow nir and two swir bands and three bands at 60 m a coastal aerosol water vapour and cirrus band swath width is 290 km in 2016 only sentinel 2 a were available with a frequency of 10 days between 1 april and 30 october 2016 a total of 82 sentinel 2 a images were acquired in july 2017 sentinel 2b became operational increasing the revisiting time to 5 days at high latitudes however sentinel 2 swaths overlap and some regions are observed twice or more every 5 days the number of sentinel 2 a and 2b images acquired between 1 april and 31 october 2017 increased to 129 2 7 1 pre processing georeferenced top of atmosphere reflectance data received from esa for sentinel 2 and deimos imaging for dmc 2 deimos 1 were pre processed the geolocation of the sentinel 2 data was inspected visually by an operator using a vector file with a set of control points consisting of 4 to 7 easily recognizable features per image 100 100 km² when the average deviation from the control points was larger than five meters in the x and or y direction a correction was applied a linear shift was performed on the image in the x and or y direction equal to the average deviation from the control points the dmc 2 deimos 1 images were corrected for geolocation errors by the provider deimos imaging atmospheric correction of both dmc 2 deimos 1 and sentinel 2 images was based on the icor algorithm de keukelaere et al 2018 for cloud haze and shadow detection in dmc 2 deimos 1 images the following method was used areas affected with haze and cloud cover were mapped by applying a haze optimized transform hot image transformation marais et al 2011 to map shadowed areas a hue saturation intensity hsi image transformation was applied using predefined reflectance thresholds that richter and schläpfer 2011 pixels of clouds haze and shadows were sampled the hot and hsi pixel values of these pixels were stored in arrays the hot and hsi mean μ and standard deviation σ of these arrays were determined the hot and his threshold values t were determined using eq 4 4 t if μ 3σ tmin μ 3σ tmin where tmin is a minimum threshold value to detect cloud haze and shadow in the sentinel 2 images the sen2cor algorithm was used mueller wilm 2017 finally biophysical parameters fcover fapar and lai were calculated from the top of canopy normalised reflectances following the bv net method described in weiss and baret 2016 the bv net version used here was calibrated with green red and near infrared bands since these spectral bands are similar between dmc 2 deimos 1 and sentinel 2 thereby increasing consistency between the biophysical parameters of both sensors 2 7 2 time series cleaning satellite time series of biophysical parameters over belgium are by nature irregular due to the strong presence of clouds and shadows furthermore cloud shadow detection often leads to omission errors leaving behind undetected observations of mostly haze and cloud shadows apparent as negative outliers in the temporal profiles therefore a crop specific method was applied to clean such time series by outlier elimination interpolation and smoothing procedures the latter relies on the weighted least squares smoothing algorithm by swets 1999 and adapted by klisch et al 2006 which was implemented in the spirits software for analysing image time series eerens et al 2014 rembold et al 2015 the assumption for outlier detection was that within the growing season a sudden drop of the crops biophysical performance is highly unlikely hence the method removed such local minima in predefined periods based on specific thresholds and number of iterations the remaining valid observations were connected through linear interpolation the last step was the smoothing procedure which assigned weights to local minima maxima and equal values which do not change between consecutive timesteps in the swets smoothing procedure swets 1999 the weights were fixed over the entire smoothing period mainly based on the assumption that local minima were mostly caused by undetected cloud shadows this was often the case when such local minima occurred throughout the growing season but the events that occurred at the start of the crop season clearing the field sowing planting and emergence could also result in temporal dips especially when there were only sparse observations in time available these start of season dips were often smoothed out when local minima was given a low weight the same occurred at the end of the season hence it was chosen to split up the season in temporal windows with each window having their own weights table 3 in most cases the cleaning of the time series of biophysical parameters led to more realistic growth curves as illustrated for maize fcover canopy cover in the next paragraph when only very few satellite observations were available over a longer period the interpolation step led to false results and deviating curves fig 3 shows two examples of the original fcover observations and the cleaned and smoothed version 2 7 3 phenological parameters phenological parameters were extracted from smoothed time series using a modified version of the pixel wise adaptive thresholding technique proposed by white et al 1997 this procedure is available in the spirits software eerens et al 2014 and has been described in van hoolst et al 2016 the most important parameters for this study were start of season sos which can be linked to crop emergence and maximum of the season mos sos is defined as the moment when the rising vegetation index vi curve the canopy cover in this case meets the threshold visos 5 visos vi min sos tsos x vi max vi min sos where vimax is the vi at the maximum of the cycle and vimin sos the value of the preceding minimum tsos was constant at 0 15 both parameters sos and mos were used further for data assimilation fig 4 shows the emergence date detected by the algorithm for four different maize fields a b c and d respectively it corresponds to 20 32 30 and 24 days after planting dap 2 8 performance metrics to assess the model performance for both calibration and validation steps basic accuracy estimators were used the rmse eq 6 provided weighted variations in error residual between estimated and observed canopy cover or above ground total dry biomass the closer the rmse is to zero the better the model simulation performance 6 r m s e s s e n where n is total number of observations and sse the sum of square error the coefficient of determination r² showed the goodness of fit eq 7 7 r 2 i 1 n y ˆ i y ² i 1 n y i y ² where y i is observed value number i y ˆ i the corresponding predicted value and y the average of observed values 3 results and discussion 3 1 water balance depletion monitoring due to the spatial dispersion of the parcels the water balance is different from a parcel to another because of underlying differences in rainfall regime soil characteristics and management practices it is also different from one year to another because of varying weather conditions e g 2015 was dry and 2016 was wet the aim of this study is not the quantification of water stress at parcel level nevertheless for each parcel the root zone water depletion is automatically plotted on a dashboard to better understand its impact on the canopy expansion in case of small canopy expansion water depletion provided a potential explanation fig 5 shows the water depletion in the rooting zone with several water stress thresholds when water depletion reaches a certain threshold canopy expansion is delayed or even stopped other factors that might reduce canopy development nutrient stress pathogens etc were not monitored 3 2 performance for canopy cover assessment the model was calibrated by minimising the difference between simulated canopy cover values and those from remote sensing the main calibrated parameters conservative and non conservative are summarised in table 4 most conservative parameters are comparable to those reported for maize in the literature hsiao et al 2009 paredes et al 2014 given the variability in sowing densities 94 000 110 000 plants ha in sowing dates april 10 may 18 and harvest dates september 7 october 24 the assimilation of satellite based emergence dates and maximum canopy cover allowed us to better simulate the crop cycle for each parcel the crop growth curves were improved by recalibrating the shape parameters cgc and cdc as a result the r² between the simulated canopy cover and satellite data for the entire calibration dataset evolved from 0 36 to 0 81 and the rmse from 41 17 to 16 69 after the calibration the calibrated cgc is higher than the one obtained by hsiao et al 2009 and paredes et al 2014 but lower than in abedinpour et al 2012 the cdc value is lower than the one reported in the literature because of the particular climate of belgium table 5 shows detailed statistics metrics calculated between simulated and remotely sensed canopy cover for each field cleaned satellite data at acquisition dates were used for the comparison instead of daily interpolated data to minimise temporal autocorrelation for the calibration dataset 84 of parcels showed an r² between 0 7 0 98 while for 16 of parcels the r² varied between 0 37 0 68 the rmse of the entire parcels of the calibration dataset varied between 5 6 and 29 53 the validation dataset comprised of 2017 data showed an r² between 0 76 0 98 for 93 33 of the parcels while for 6 67 of the parcels the r² was equal to 0 25 the root mean square error varied between 8 19 33 74 the potential of satellite derived canopy cover assimilation depends mainly on the availability of exploitable images especially at the onset of the growth cycle and the ability of the clouds and aerosols detection algorithm used some fields showed atypical maize growth profiles i e canopy cover evolution suggesting the presence of outliers having escaped the time series cleaning fig 6 i this may explain in some cases the weak agreement between satellite based and simulated canopy cover the current field extraction outlier and smoothing methodology has two main limitations firstly it does not fully take into account the scene classification layer as provided by esa which labels each pixel amongst a number of categories such as cloud cloud shadows cirrus vegetation soils deserts water snow etc secondly the smoothing procedure includes an interpolation step before the actual smoothing is done this hampers the impact of the weights assigned to local extrema the per field time series are expected to become more reliable if they are a priori masked with the scene classification and if the remaining clean points are directly fed into a temporally weighted smoothing procedure in other cases the presence of weeds due to a late herbicide application impacted the canopy cover values wellens et al 2017b 3 3 performance for aboveground total dry biomass assessment wp are the main calibrated parameters that affect above ground total dry biomass the values were gradually readjusted until a best agreement was reached between simulated and observed biomass results are shown in fig 7 where the red line represents the x y line the water productivity retained during calibration wp 29 3 is at the limit of the range suggested by the model developers raes et al 2012 for c4 crops the r² between simulated and measured above ground total dry biomass in the calibration dataset was equal to 0 82 and the rmse 0 69 ton ha which represents 3 75 of the average biomass for validation the r² reached 0 85 and the rmse was equal to 0 7 ton ha it is important to remember that maximum canopy cover and emergence date assimilation were not limited to the calibration phase but were also applied to the validation data set in 2017 the sentinel constellation was enriched with the sentinel 2b satellite which increased the temporal resolution of sentinel 2 images from 10 to 5 days the increased number of satellite observations which only affect the validation data set may have allowed a better smoothing of the time series and therefore a better detection of maximum canopy cover and emergence dates this would explain the slightly higher r² for validation compared to calibration fig 6 g and h shows examples of canopy cover time series obtained with a 10 day image acquisition frequency in these cases the period of maximum canopy cover from flowering to start of senescence is detected very late and lasts only a few days akumaga et al 2017 and paredes et al 2014 used aquacrop to estimate above ground total dry biomass under different irrigation and fertilisation conditions the reported rmse are higher than those obtained in this study but are in line with those obtained by abedinpour et al 2012 in order to evaluate the contribution of the satellite data assimilation to the total biomass estimation four different scenarios were followed table 6 presents the different scenarios and obtained results for all scenarios data from the validation dataset were used first the crop growth model was exclusively used with default parameters and without assimilation then the remote sensing derived canopy cover data were assimilated to the model without prior calibration even when using the default parameters the assimilation procedure increased the r² between measured and simulated above ground total dry biomass from 0 04 to 0 35 and decreased the rmse from 5 36 ton ha to 3 8 ton ha when using the calibrated instead of default parameters the performance of the model is significantly higher after assimilation the r² further increases from 0 48 to 0 85 and the rmse decreases from 3 31 ton ha to 0 7 ton ha this result illustrates the remarkable influence of the remotely sensed field specific data on the above ground dry total biomass estimation 4 conclusion this study showed the possibility to estimate rainfed maize above ground dry total biomass at field level using satellite based estimated field specific emergence date and maximum canopy cover by updating the data within the aquacrop model however despite the model calibration and the daily interpolation of satellite canopy cover before detecting emergence date and maximum canopy high frequency and reliable satellite data especially at the season onset could be decisive regarding the results embedding the aquacrop plugin an r environment considerably facilitated model calibration and validation before similar assessments were carried out field by field the r environment enabled to run and evaluate the ensemble of fields in a single run hence gaining time and increasing user friendliness the restricted amount of assimilated data and number of calibrated parameters showed the solidness and robustness of the aquacrop model in different locations in belgium and therefore in different pedoclimatic environments the growth model also proved its potential to ingest earth observation data good agreements was found between simulated and observed canopy cover good agreement was also noted between simulated and measured above ground dry biomass the successful combination of a crop growth model and field level satellite canopy cover data is promising for monitoring agricultural fields over larger areas declarations of

11088,coupling crop growth models and remote sensing data has shown great potential to improve crop yield and biomass forecasting however few such applications are used at field level in this study the plug in version of aquacrop a water driven model initially designed for conditions in which water is the limiting factor in crop production was adapted to assess maize in belgium field campaigns were organised in 2015 2016 and 2017 during which ground measurements were collected at field level and under rainfed conditions above ground total dry biomass and field management information crop density planting dates biomass measurements etc was collected green fractional vegetation cover fcover data were retrieved from high spatial and temporal satellite images dmc 2 deimos 1 and sentinel 2 maximum canopy cover and emergence date were derived from the time series and assimilated into aquacrop the model was calibrated with the 2015 2016 dataset and validated with 2017 data the root mean square error rmse for the biomass assessment was 0 7 ton ha and the r² reached 0 85 the r² between the canopy cover simulated by the model and the remotely sensed fcover ranged from 0 76 0 98 in most of the cases to simultaneously run and evaluate the ensemble of field level simulations a semi automated r environment was developed this robust and automated approach offers vast potential for large scale field level yield assessments for temperate as well as tropical conditions keywords aquacrop model remote sensing data integration semi automatic approach maize belgium 1 introduction crop yield and total biomass assessment is vital for human well being with regards to agriculture activities such as productivity management traditional yield and biomass estimation is usually carried out through either field sampling measurements or agro meteorological modelling wellens et al 2017b however field measurements are often costly and time consuming moreover the accuracy of the agrometeorological models is not always sufficient for operational purposes for an efficient crop biomass or yield prediction integrating remotely sensed data into a crop growth model has great advantages when compared to traditional methods ma et al 2013 several previous studies have illustrated the positive influence of data integration into different crop growth models on yield or biomass estimation using different methods over various crop curnel et al 2011 dente et al 2008 guerif and duke 2000 launay and guerif 2005 zhao et al 2013 a large number of crop growth models have been developed by the scientific community dssat jones et al 2003 and wofost diepen et al 1989 crop models are the most well known depending on their complexity the largest disadvantage of these models is the requirement for a huge amount of input data and parameters van gaelen et al 2015 the fao s aquacrop model raes et al 2009 however stands out by its simplicity accuracy robustness and the requirement for a relatively small number of input parameters the model has been tested in different conditions for several crops cabbage rice wheat maize teff etc in several locations abedinpour et al 2012 akumaga et al 2017 hussein et al 2011 wellens et al 2013 however model prediction can be improved by using remote sensing data remote sensing technology is able to quantitatively depict crop growth conditions at different scales and reflect the impact of environmental factors on crop growth and development remote sensing information can reflect the actual crop growth and development and provide an objective observation of crop growth conditions since the rapid development and availability of products with different spatial and temporal resolutions the integration of remote sensing data into crop growth models has increased in recent years linker and ioslovich 2017 have successfully shown the possibility of assimilating ground measured canopy cover data using digital images above the canopy during the growing season within the aquacrop model for potato and cotton based on the extended kalman filter algorithm however this innovative procedure requires field data collection during the season which is budget and time consuming but today it can be facilitated and improved using earth observation data especially from sentinel 2 satellite sensors whose temporal and spatial resolution is adapted for parcel monitoring jin et al 2016 used spectral based biomass values computed with on field spectral measurement data to calibrate the aquacrop model with a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm for winter wheat in china the same pso algorithm was used for winter wheat by silvestro et al 2017 and jin et al 2017 to assimilate optical and radar satellite data into the aquacrop model several coupling methods have been categorised and detailed by delécolle et al 1992 and jin et al 2018 one of these methods is by substituting crop growth models variables with remotely sensed data modelling results can then be tuned in line with observed results by readjusting model parameters or reparametrizing the crop growth model zhao et al 2013 a similar approach using remote sensing coarse resolution data was used to calibrate the aquacrop model with the leaf area index from modis for winter wheat in italy by trombetta et al 2016 it was only applied to large agricultural parcels due to modis s limited spatial resolution the main objective of this study is to couple high temporal and spatial resolution remote sensing data and an agrometeorological crop model aquacrop to estimate maize growth and total above ground dry biomass at parcel level in belgium for these purposes the standalone aquacrop plug in was embedded in an r environment team 2014 to semi automatically run field simulations and assess the results the specific objectives consist of i acquire process and smooth using swets algorithm satellite time series data dmc 2 deimos 1 and sentinel 2 ii retrieve maximum canopy cover and emergence date from the smoothed time series iii ingest field specific data into the aquacrop model since aquacrop was not calibrated for such a purpose for maize in belgium calibration work was conducted simultaneously with data integration on the 2015 and 2016 datasets to fix model parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 field data throughout 2015 2016 and 2017 maize fields were monitored at different degrees of intensity fields were selected based on several criteria the location of experimental fields is shown in fig 1 each field should not be smaller than 2 ha and field width must exceed 80 m to include enough pixels only one cultivar must be sown per field a total of 40 maize fields were monitored over 3 years detailed information about the fields is given in table 1 a sampling approach proposed by centre indépendant de promotion fourragère cipf and based on their experience and practical knowledge was used in the present study the biomass samples were collected at harvest for each field a total number of three maize rows of 3 4 m length were harvested the samples were collected at different locations on the fields considering an inner buffer of 6 m from the field boundaries to avoid edge effects a lateral distance of at least 10 m depending on the field size separated the extremities of the harvested rows each sampling row consisted of approximately 21 27 plants which formed a batch each batch was shredded separately and mixed homogeneously then sub biomass particles of nearly 1 kg for each batch were oven dried at 70 c for a time frame of 72 h and finally the dry matter content was calculated for a given parcel the average dry matter content of the three batches was considered the biomass was extrapolated to 1 ha table 2 summarises the statistics of biomass data due to a communication issue three parcels were harvested before sampling farmers were invited to deliver additional information on management practices e g plant densities planting and harvest dates fertiliser applications type date and amount and observations of extreme events water stress water logging pests and diseases all monitored fields were under rainfed conditions 2 2 crop model description 2 2 1 aquacrop the aquacrop model predicts crops yield and biomass as a response to water under rainfed deficit or full irrigation conditions after separating the evapotranspiration into i crop transpiration tr which is the amount of water taken by the roots and used for the crop metabolism and ii soil evaporation which is the amount of water lost through the atmosphere biomass b growth is simulated through its assumed linear relationship with crop transpiration tr this separation avoids the confounding effect of the non productive consumptive use of water more details on the model description are available in steduto et al 2009 and raes et al 2009 a water productivity wp parameter converts the actual crop transpiration into biomass for a given time and climate condition the biomass is the result of wp and accumulated transpiration eq 1 de wit 1958 hanks 1983 steduto et al 2009 1 b w p σ t r 2 w p b σ t r e t o 3 y h i b the wp is a crop specific parameter defining the amount of produced biomass per unit of consumed water if normalised for evapotranspiration eq 2 it remains virtually constant over a range of environments steduto et al 2007 which makes aquacrop applicable across diverse locations and seasons wp represents the normalised water productivity for most crops only part of the biomass produced is considered harvestable this harvestable yield y is the product of the harvest index hi also a crop specific parameter and biomass b eq 3 no intermediary hierarchical or physiological processes are considered in the biomass growth simulation as a result the model remains simple and robust requiring only a limited number of input parameters steduto et al 2009 furthermore crop transpiration and hence also crop development are driven by the more straightforward canopy ground cover cc fractional coverage of green cover per unit of soil instead of the usual leaf area index lai two kinds of parameters are differentiated in aquacrop i fixed or conservative and ii case specific or non conservative parameters conservative parameters are not influenced by geography field management or time and remain constant for different cultivars and agrometeorological conditions steduto et al 2012 they are obtained under non limiting growing conditions and remain applicable in cases of stress thanks to the necessary stress response functions raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 the main conservative parameters are canopy growth cgc and canopy decline cdc coefficients full canopy crop transpiration coefficient kc biomass wp and soil water depletion thresholds other crop parameters are case specific and non conservative e g sowing density length of phenological stages and influenced by climate field management practices and soil type they must be provided for each specific case or can if needed be estimated by the model raes et al 2012 2009 the aquacrop database already comes with a default set of calibrated crop files and research results on supplemental crops are widely available in the literature 2 2 2 aquacrop plug in acsav50 identical to the standard program the aquacrop plug in program uses the same calculation procedures but as a stand alone executable version 5 0 of the plug in was used in time calendar setting when run the program generates and executes a list of projects containing all required simulation information and results are stored in output files wellens et al 2017a the plug in program is intended for external applications with iterative or large numbers of simulations lorite et al 2013 2 3 meteorological and soil data soil data were retrieved from the belgian crop growth monitoring system b cgms soil map de wit et al 2012 a sub set version of the 1 1 000 000 soil geographical database of europe lambert et al 2003 the available soil characteristics were water content at saturation at field capacity and at wilting and saturated hydraulic conductivity since aquacrop is a water driven crop model this information perfectly suited the water balance calculations meteorological data for belgium were received daily by ftp transfer from the royal meteorological institute based on 125 weather stations an interpolation grid with 10 km 10 km grid cells was elaboration by van der voet et al 1994 the used daily climate data included minimum and maximum temperature relative humidity evapotranspiration and precipitation 2 4 model embedded r environment for this study a tool was developed in an r environment fig 2 this tool integrated the aquacrop plug in in a database containing the soil map of belgium and its physical parameters meteorological data a calibrated maize crop file and provided by farmers information on field management practices i e date of sowing plant density etc r scripts were developed to pick up the required data launch the aquacrop plug in executable and read out the simulation results this approach considerably improved crop file assessments now with a single run a multitude of fields were assessed the results gave a per field and overall evaluation of the simulations 2 5 crop data and model calibration vanuytrecht 2013 calibrated and validated the aquacrop model using a limited set of fields and focused mainly on the impact of climate change on yield those existing crop files served as a basis to calibrate and validate aquacrop with the current dataset model calibration consisted in revising crop and model parameters based on satellite measurement and literature in order to obtain accurate simulations versus observation two major steps were necessary for calibration canopy cover simulation is a crucial first step andarzian et al 2011 main canopy cover calibration parameters are cgc cdc and stress indices affecting leaf expansion and early senescence the effect of soil fertility was not considered as it was not a limiting factor since sufficient amounts of nutrients were added on all the monitored fields cgc and cdc were iteratively calibrated using a trial error approach until the minimum root mean square error rmse and the highest coefficient of determination r² were obtained between simulated canopy cover and cleaned see 2 7 2 time series cleaning satellite data at acquisition dates moreover the results were evaluated by graphical inspection comparing daily simulated canopy cover and daily interpolated satellite derived data however only the statistical metrics guided the calibration the graphical evaluation was given as an overview after calibrating canopy cover related parameters wp was re adjusted by comparing simulated and observed final above ground dry total biomass using the same approach as for canopy cover related parameters biomass data throughout the growing season were not available the entire dataset was divided in two parts according to the year of acquisition the first dataset composed of 2015 and 2016 data was used for calibration during which parameters were adjusted the 2017 dataset was used for the validation using the parameters fixed at the calibration 2 6 assimilation procedure detailed review of remote sensing data assimilation in crop models has been provided by jin et al 2018 in the present study a continuous assimilation strategy was applied on canopy cover related parameters the assimilation was performed on both calibration and validation datasets only during calibration are modelling results tuned in line with the observed results by adjusting the initial conditions or readjusting model parameters as canopy expansion expresses crop development it is assumed that maximum canopy cover provides indirectly useful information about the state of the crop at flowering stage water stress soil fertility and salinity stress hamper canopy development and result in a lower maximum canopy cover providing this information can therefore improve the crop modelling hence assimilation concentrated firstly on retrieving each field s maximum canopy cover from the satellite canopy cover time series and integrating that value into the processing chain by updating the model value the time from sowing to emergence is another important parameter in crop growth simulation raes et al 2009 since this information triggers the start of the simulation when badly defined a gap between the actual crop cycle and the simulated cycle is observed the second assimilation consisted therefore in updating the model emergence dates with emergence dates derived from the satellite canopy cover time series this allowed to match the satellite observed with the simulated growing cycle for each field the step by step approach was especially important to calibration as it facilitated the parameters settings for validation the assimilation of maximum canopy cover and the emergence date was done directly using the calibrated crop file 2 7 satellite data a time series of 17 commercial dmc 2 deimos 1 images with maximum cloud cover percentage of 30 was acquired over belgium between 8 march and 11 october 2015 to cover the first field campaign dmc 2 deimos 1 sensors provide three spectral bands in the green red and nir near infrared ranges with 650 625 km swath and a spatial resolution of 22 m for the last two field campaigns freely available sentinel 2 images were used sentinel 2 data are acquired on 13 spectral bands in the vnir visible and near infrared and swir short wave infrared range of which four bands at 10 m resolution blue green red and nir six bands at 20 m three red edge bands a narrow nir and two swir bands and three bands at 60 m a coastal aerosol water vapour and cirrus band swath width is 290 km in 2016 only sentinel 2 a were available with a frequency of 10 days between 1 april and 30 october 2016 a total of 82 sentinel 2 a images were acquired in july 2017 sentinel 2b became operational increasing the revisiting time to 5 days at high latitudes however sentinel 2 swaths overlap and some regions are observed twice or more every 5 days the number of sentinel 2 a and 2b images acquired between 1 april and 31 october 2017 increased to 129 2 7 1 pre processing georeferenced top of atmosphere reflectance data received from esa for sentinel 2 and deimos imaging for dmc 2 deimos 1 were pre processed the geolocation of the sentinel 2 data was inspected visually by an operator using a vector file with a set of control points consisting of 4 to 7 easily recognizable features per image 100 100 km² when the average deviation from the control points was larger than five meters in the x and or y direction a correction was applied a linear shift was performed on the image in the x and or y direction equal to the average deviation from the control points the dmc 2 deimos 1 images were corrected for geolocation errors by the provider deimos imaging atmospheric correction of both dmc 2 deimos 1 and sentinel 2 images was based on the icor algorithm de keukelaere et al 2018 for cloud haze and shadow detection in dmc 2 deimos 1 images the following method was used areas affected with haze and cloud cover were mapped by applying a haze optimized transform hot image transformation marais et al 2011 to map shadowed areas a hue saturation intensity hsi image transformation was applied using predefined reflectance thresholds that richter and schläpfer 2011 pixels of clouds haze and shadows were sampled the hot and hsi pixel values of these pixels were stored in arrays the hot and hsi mean μ and standard deviation σ of these arrays were determined the hot and his threshold values t were determined using eq 4 4 t if μ 3σ tmin μ 3σ tmin where tmin is a minimum threshold value to detect cloud haze and shadow in the sentinel 2 images the sen2cor algorithm was used mueller wilm 2017 finally biophysical parameters fcover fapar and lai were calculated from the top of canopy normalised reflectances following the bv net method described in weiss and baret 2016 the bv net version used here was calibrated with green red and near infrared bands since these spectral bands are similar between dmc 2 deimos 1 and sentinel 2 thereby increasing consistency between the biophysical parameters of both sensors 2 7 2 time series cleaning satellite time series of biophysical parameters over belgium are by nature irregular due to the strong presence of clouds and shadows furthermore cloud shadow detection often leads to omission errors leaving behind undetected observations of mostly haze and cloud shadows apparent as negative outliers in the temporal profiles therefore a crop specific method was applied to clean such time series by outlier elimination interpolation and smoothing procedures the latter relies on the weighted least squares smoothing algorithm by swets 1999 and adapted by klisch et al 2006 which was implemented in the spirits software for analysing image time series eerens et al 2014 rembold et al 2015 the assumption for outlier detection was that within the growing season a sudden drop of the crops biophysical performance is highly unlikely hence the method removed such local minima in predefined periods based on specific thresholds and number of iterations the remaining valid observations were connected through linear interpolation the last step was the smoothing procedure which assigned weights to local minima maxima and equal values which do not change between consecutive timesteps in the swets smoothing procedure swets 1999 the weights were fixed over the entire smoothing period mainly based on the assumption that local minima were mostly caused by undetected cloud shadows this was often the case when such local minima occurred throughout the growing season but the events that occurred at the start of the crop season clearing the field sowing planting and emergence could also result in temporal dips especially when there were only sparse observations in time available these start of season dips were often smoothed out when local minima was given a low weight the same occurred at the end of the season hence it was chosen to split up the season in temporal windows with each window having their own weights table 3 in most cases the cleaning of the time series of biophysical parameters led to more realistic growth curves as illustrated for maize fcover canopy cover in the next paragraph when only very few satellite observations were available over a longer period the interpolation step led to false results and deviating curves fig 3 shows two examples of the original fcover observations and the cleaned and smoothed version 2 7 3 phenological parameters phenological parameters were extracted from smoothed time series using a modified version of the pixel wise adaptive thresholding technique proposed by white et al 1997 this procedure is available in the spirits software eerens et al 2014 and has been described in van hoolst et al 2016 the most important parameters for this study were start of season sos which can be linked to crop emergence and maximum of the season mos sos is defined as the moment when the rising vegetation index vi curve the canopy cover in this case meets the threshold visos 5 visos vi min sos tsos x vi max vi min sos where vimax is the vi at the maximum of the cycle and vimin sos the value of the preceding minimum tsos was constant at 0 15 both parameters sos and mos were used further for data assimilation fig 4 shows the emergence date detected by the algorithm for four different maize fields a b c and d respectively it corresponds to 20 32 30 and 24 days after planting dap 2 8 performance metrics to assess the model performance for both calibration and validation steps basic accuracy estimators were used the rmse eq 6 provided weighted variations in error residual between estimated and observed canopy cover or above ground total dry biomass the closer the rmse is to zero the better the model simulation performance 6 r m s e s s e n where n is total number of observations and sse the sum of square error the coefficient of determination r² showed the goodness of fit eq 7 7 r 2 i 1 n y ˆ i y ² i 1 n y i y ² where y i is observed value number i y ˆ i the corresponding predicted value and y the average of observed values 3 results and discussion 3 1 water balance depletion monitoring due to the spatial dispersion of the parcels the water balance is different from a parcel to another because of underlying differences in rainfall regime soil characteristics and management practices it is also different from one year to another because of varying weather conditions e g 2015 was dry and 2016 was wet the aim of this study is not the quantification of water stress at parcel level nevertheless for each parcel the root zone water depletion is automatically plotted on a dashboard to better understand its impact on the canopy expansion in case of small canopy expansion water depletion provided a potential explanation fig 5 shows the water depletion in the rooting zone with several water stress thresholds when water depletion reaches a certain threshold canopy expansion is delayed or even stopped other factors that might reduce canopy development nutrient stress pathogens etc were not monitored 3 2 performance for canopy cover assessment the model was calibrated by minimising the difference between simulated canopy cover values and those from remote sensing the main calibrated parameters conservative and non conservative are summarised in table 4 most conservative parameters are comparable to those reported for maize in the literature hsiao et al 2009 paredes et al 2014 given the variability in sowing densities 94 000 110 000 plants ha in sowing dates april 10 may 18 and harvest dates september 7 october 24 the assimilation of satellite based emergence dates and maximum canopy cover allowed us to better simulate the crop cycle for each parcel the crop growth curves were improved by recalibrating the shape parameters cgc and cdc as a result the r² between the simulated canopy cover and satellite data for the entire calibration dataset evolved from 0 36 to 0 81 and the rmse from 41 17 to 16 69 after the calibration the calibrated cgc is higher than the one obtained by hsiao et al 2009 and paredes et al 2014 but lower than in abedinpour et al 2012 the cdc value is lower than the one reported in the literature because of the particular climate of belgium table 5 shows detailed statistics metrics calculated between simulated and remotely sensed canopy cover for each field cleaned satellite data at acquisition dates were used for the comparison instead of daily interpolated data to minimise temporal autocorrelation for the calibration dataset 84 of parcels showed an r² between 0 7 0 98 while for 16 of parcels the r² varied between 0 37 0 68 the rmse of the entire parcels of the calibration dataset varied between 5 6 and 29 53 the validation dataset comprised of 2017 data showed an r² between 0 76 0 98 for 93 33 of the parcels while for 6 67 of the parcels the r² was equal to 0 25 the root mean square error varied between 8 19 33 74 the potential of satellite derived canopy cover assimilation depends mainly on the availability of exploitable images especially at the onset of the growth cycle and the ability of the clouds and aerosols detection algorithm used some fields showed atypical maize growth profiles i e canopy cover evolution suggesting the presence of outliers having escaped the time series cleaning fig 6 i this may explain in some cases the weak agreement between satellite based and simulated canopy cover the current field extraction outlier and smoothing methodology has two main limitations firstly it does not fully take into account the scene classification layer as provided by esa which labels each pixel amongst a number of categories such as cloud cloud shadows cirrus vegetation soils deserts water snow etc secondly the smoothing procedure includes an interpolation step before the actual smoothing is done this hampers the impact of the weights assigned to local extrema the per field time series are expected to become more reliable if they are a priori masked with the scene classification and if the remaining clean points are directly fed into a temporally weighted smoothing procedure in other cases the presence of weeds due to a late herbicide application impacted the canopy cover values wellens et al 2017b 3 3 performance for aboveground total dry biomass assessment wp are the main calibrated parameters that affect above ground total dry biomass the values were gradually readjusted until a best agreement was reached between simulated and observed biomass results are shown in fig 7 where the red line represents the x y line the water productivity retained during calibration wp 29 3 is at the limit of the range suggested by the model developers raes et al 2012 for c4 crops the r² between simulated and measured above ground total dry biomass in the calibration dataset was equal to 0 82 and the rmse 0 69 ton ha which represents 3 75 of the average biomass for validation the r² reached 0 85 and the rmse was equal to 0 7 ton ha it is important to remember that maximum canopy cover and emergence date assimilation were not limited to the calibration phase but were also applied to the validation data set in 2017 the sentinel constellation was enriched with the sentinel 2b satellite which increased the temporal resolution of sentinel 2 images from 10 to 5 days the increased number of satellite observations which only affect the validation data set may have allowed a better smoothing of the time series and therefore a better detection of maximum canopy cover and emergence dates this would explain the slightly higher r² for validation compared to calibration fig 6 g and h shows examples of canopy cover time series obtained with a 10 day image acquisition frequency in these cases the period of maximum canopy cover from flowering to start of senescence is detected very late and lasts only a few days akumaga et al 2017 and paredes et al 2014 used aquacrop to estimate above ground total dry biomass under different irrigation and fertilisation conditions the reported rmse are higher than those obtained in this study but are in line with those obtained by abedinpour et al 2012 in order to evaluate the contribution of the satellite data assimilation to the total biomass estimation four different scenarios were followed table 6 presents the different scenarios and obtained results for all scenarios data from the validation dataset were used first the crop growth model was exclusively used with default parameters and without assimilation then the remote sensing derived canopy cover data were assimilated to the model without prior calibration even when using the default parameters the assimilation procedure increased the r² between measured and simulated above ground total dry biomass from 0 04 to 0 35 and decreased the rmse from 5 36 ton ha to 3 8 ton ha when using the calibrated instead of default parameters the performance of the model is significantly higher after assimilation the r² further increases from 0 48 to 0 85 and the rmse decreases from 3 31 ton ha to 0 7 ton ha this result illustrates the remarkable influence of the remotely sensed field specific data on the above ground dry total biomass estimation 4 conclusion this study showed the possibility to estimate rainfed maize above ground dry total biomass at field level using satellite based estimated field specific emergence date and maximum canopy cover by updating the data within the aquacrop model however despite the model calibration and the daily interpolation of satellite canopy cover before detecting emergence date and maximum canopy high frequency and reliable satellite data especially at the season onset could be decisive regarding the results embedding the aquacrop plugin an r environment considerably facilitated model calibration and validation before similar assessments were carried out field by field the r environment enabled to run and evaluate the ensemble of fields in a single run hence gaining time and increasing user friendliness the restricted amount of assimilated data and number of calibrated parameters showed the solidness and robustness of the aquacrop model in different locations in belgium and therefore in different pedoclimatic environments the growth model also proved its potential to ingest earth observation data good agreements was found between simulated and observed canopy cover good agreement was also noted between simulated and measured above

11089,hyperspectral sensing technique can provide an exact and expeditious manner for effective management of deficit irrigation through assessment of changes in plant water status in a large scale and real time this hypothesis was tested in this study using the hyperspectral signatures of the canopy in the visible vis near nir and shortwave infrared swir to estimate and predict the leaf water status measured here in terms of leaf water potential lwp relative water content rwc and equivalent water thickness ewt and grain yield gy of wheat cultivars exposed to 1 00 0 75 and 0 50 of the estimated evapotranspiration etc results showed that the three parameters of leaf water status exhibited strong correlations with gy under 0 75 except lwp and 0 50 etc treatments this indicates that these parameters can be used as early indicators for management of deficit irrigation based on the relationships between these four phenotypic parameters and original canopy spectral reflectance within 350 2500 nm the sensitive spectral wavelengths that exhibited strong correlations with all parameters existed mainly within the nir and swir regions with peak wavelengths around 351 518 and 687 nm in the vis 762 974 1100 and 1240 nm in the nir and 1392 1515 1930 and 2273 nm in the swir regions these peak wavelengths were used to build new two and three band normalized spectral reflectance indices ndsis the ndsis that combine nir and vis nir and nir swir and nir and swir and swir wavelengths were more effective for tracking changes in leaf water status and gy than those that combine only vis wavelengths the high fit between the observed and predicted values for phenotypic parameters based on twelve newly developed and published ndsis indicates that the most recently developed ndsi models were more precise and accurate and thus could be used for monitoring the changes in leaf water status and wheat production caused by deficit irrigation the performance of partial least square regression plsr based on either eleven wavelengths or different ndsis as a predictive approach was the same and sometimes better than the individual ndsis for assessment of phenotypic parameters the results of spectral reflectance data and plsr tools can serve as rapid and non destructive alternative approaches for monitoring the water status and wheat production and can be used to develop certain spectral indices for management of deficit irrigation in arid regions keywords equivalent water thickness estimated evapotranspiration hyperspectral reflectance leaf water potential phenotyping wavelength selection 1 introduction water shortage currently plagues almost every country in arid and semiarid regions and is one of the key factors for stagnation and decrease of crop production in these regions in addition the global climate change which is synchronously accompanied by low and variable precipitation high evaporation rates and frequent incidences of drought causing water shortage in these regions has already become the rule rather than the exception furthermore most of cropping areas in these regions are irrigated and consumes about 75 of the total available water supply thus gradually shifting from full irrigation to deficit irrigation practices in order to achieve maximum crop production per unit of irrigation water applied rather than emphasizing on production per unit of area represents a plausible solution to deal with this issue el hendawy et al 2017a fereres and soriano 2007 accurate estimation and real time detection of the responses of different plant parameters to deficit irrigation particularly those associated with the plant water status are increasingly required for effective water management in precision agriculture the valuable information provided by the monitoring of plant water status can be used directly or indirectly for different purposes such as assessment of drought indicators understanding the relationships between plant and soil water mapping and monitoring the conditions of plant biosphere processes aiding in yield estimation and making sound decisions related to irrigation scheduling which involve deciding when and how much water should be applied gutierrez et al 2010 peñuelas et al 1994 stimson et al 2005 wang et al 2015 leaf water potential lwp relative water content rwc and equivalent water thickness ewt have been developed and widely used as indicators for monitoring plant water status lwp is used as the standard parameter while rwc is often used as a substitute plant parameter for detecting plant water status clevers et al 2008 elsayed et al 2011 kakani et al 2007 rwc is expressed as a fraction of the water volume for the leaf at full turgidity and has a real physiological meaning because it measures the amount of water available for leaf transpiration and reflects the physiological outcome of cellular water deficit chaves et al 2003 rossini et al 2013 ewt is defined as the ratio between the volume of water and the leaf area danson et al 1992 yao et al 2014 therefore gaining a comprehensive and better understanding of these plant water parameters will play an important role in managing deficit irrigation and sustaining crop production under such conditions the ordinary methods for the measurement of these three plant water status parameters that include measuring the area and fresh weight of the leaves and drying them in an oven are practicable very simple and do not require special expertise nonetheless they are generally time and cost inefficient destructive and tedious fail to fulfill the requirement of real time evaluation and are not feasible when the measurements are made on a large scale importantly some methods provide information on the plant water status such as lwp solely on a single effective leaf such measurements are not only time and cost inefficient but also subject to errors and unrepresentative of the water status of the entire canopy consequently quantitative and instantaneous methods for assessment of these plant parameters are needed to address the aforementioned drawbacks of the conventional measurement methods as well as to advance deficit irrigation regulation in wheat through precision agriculture practices spectral reflectance techniques have been demonstrated to be instantaneous cheap applicable for a large scale and non destructive alternative methods for integrative assessment of several phenotypic parameters under different environmental conditions el hendawy et al 2017a b elsayed et al 2017 gitelson et al 2003 lobos et al 2014 rapaport et al 2017 sun et al 2008 the ground based hyperspectral reflectance technique which detects the spectral reflectance of the canopy from visible vis to shortwave infrared swir has been shown to have a great potential to detect even the slight variations and modifications in biophysical and biochemical characteristics of the canopy therefore it is successfully used to track the changes in plant parameters related to plant water status the possibility of detecting various water related parameters through proximal remote sensing data derives from the fact that canopy reflectance in the near infrared nir 700 1300 nm and the shortwave infrared swir 1300 2500 nm regions is strongly influenced by several internal leaf structural and water content of the canopy the oh bonds in the canopy water strongly absorbs solar radiation in the nir and swir regions with the strong water absorption bands found in the swir region and centered at approximately 1450 1950 2250 and 2500 nm and the weak absorption bands located in the nir region near 970 and 1200 nm bowyer and danson 2004 ceccato et al 2002 seelig et al 2008 wang et al 2009 the canopy spectral reflectance in the nir region is also strongly affected by several internal leaf structural factors such as leaf cuticles intercellular air spaces and the ratio between palisade mesophyll and spongy mesophyll that are strongly associated with the leaf water status although the vis region 400 700 nm does not have water bands previous studies have shown that the wavelengths in this region could indirectly be used to estimate the plant water status through the effects of dehydration on the properties of the leaf pigments carter 1991 vescovo et al 2012 therefore there is also a secondary effect of plant water status on canopy spectral reflectance in the nir and vis regions thus many studies have demonstrated that various parameters related to plant water statuscould be assessed with hyperspectral instruments using different spectral reflectance indices sris based on the wavelengths of the three parts of the electromagnetic spectrum vis nir and swir for example rapaport et al 2017 developed a new index the water balance index wabi r1500 r531 r1500 r531 for monitoring the plant water status and detecting the irrigation scheduling in grapevine vitis vinifera under field conditions several studies have also found that the wavelengths in the nir region are appropriate to detect plant water status and the sris formulated based on nir wavelengths such as the water index wi r970 r900 and different normalized water indices nwi 1 r970 r900 r970 r900 nwi 2 r970 r850 r970 r850 nwi 3 r970 r880 r970 r880 and nwi 4 r970 r920 r970 r920 are better for identifying genotypic differences in plant water content under water limited conditions babar et al 2006 el hendawy et al 2015 gutierrez et al 2010 peñuelas et al 1994 prasad et al 2007 rischbeck et al 2014 zarco tejada et al 2003 estimated the leaf water content in relation to leaf area ewt and dry matter content fuel moisture content fmc using the simple ratio water index srwi r860 r1240 interestingly the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi r900 r680 r900 r680 which is one of the most widely used vegetation indices showed significant correlation with lwp and leaf water content stimson et al 2005 yao et al 2014 successfully estimated ewt in wheat under various water and nitrogen treatments by using a three band index r1429 r416 r1865 r1429 r416 r1865 gaulton et al 2013 found strong correlations between leaf ewt r2 0 80 root mean square error rmse 0 0069 g cm2 and the normalized ratio between 1063 and 1545 nm wavelengths junttila et al 2016 showed that the sris calculated from 690 905 and 1550 nm showed significant correlations with leaf ewt importantly although the strong water absorption bands located in swir are more sensitive to plant water status than the weak water absorption bands located in nir the sris that are used to assess the different parameters related to plant water status are effective when nir and swir wavelengths are combined in order to overcome the sensitivity of swir to the other leaf parameters such as dry matter and internal structure ceccato et al 2001 2002 chuvieco et al 2002 in other words the sris are efficient when measurement bands where water absorption is high and reference bands where the water absorption is weak are included although several sris have great potential for assessing different water related parameters as aforementioned and can easily be calculated these indices focus mostly on 2 3 wavelengths only importantly there are different factors related to the conditions for the measurement the spectral reflectance of the canopy i e crop phenological growth stages cultivars levels of treatments and year influencing the performance of the sris in the assessment of plant parameters additionally most regression analyses used for assessment of plant parameters relies on a single sri and therefore very few sris are applied in published work although hundreds of sris are available lobos and poblete echeverría 2017 therefore there are compelling reasons for integrating multiple sris as a single index for improving prediction analysis in the assessment of plant parameters the advantages of such analysis in the assessment of plant parameters are that 1 the plant parameters can be simultaneously assessed through different types of sris e g simple ratio sr normalized spectral indices ndsis perpendicular vegetation index pvi soil adjusted vegetation index savi and 2 the plant parameters can be simultaneously assessed through a wide range of wavelengths from the three parts of the electromagnetic spectrum multivariate regression analyses including partial least square regression plsr are found to be suitable methods for dealing with a large number of sris as a single index in order to improve the prediction of plant parameters recently plsr has been widely used to estimate and predict different plant parameters for instance plsr based on different normalized sris increased the accuracy estimations of grain yield under field conditions by decreasing rmse and increasing the coefficients of determination r2 elsayed et al 2017 strong and significant relationships were found between the observed and predicted values as well as the validation value of wheat grain yield r2 0 87 rmse 413 kg ha 1 when plsr based on different wavelengths sharabian et al 2014 in general hyperspectral measurements allow various multivariate analyses to deal with the whole spectrum wavelengths and various sris the objectives of this study were to 1 identify most wavelengths within the three regions of the spectrum vis nir and swir that were specifically sensitive to leaf water status lwp rwc and ewt and gy measured for different wheat cultivars under different levels of irrigation 2 utilize these wavelengths for developing new specific normalized spectral reflectance indices ndsis 3 examine the suitability of these new ndsis and published sris for assessment of leaf water status and gy 4 develop and validate prediction models for accurate estimation of leaf water status and gy based on various new and published ndsis and 5 compare the performance of plsr based on either different wavelengths or ndsis for estimating the leaf water status and gy in wheat we propose that developing the new ndsis will help in precise assessment and monitoring of plant water status in semiarid regions and will be useful for irrigation scheduling and maximizing the water productivity of wheat 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and growing conditions this study was

less or greater than 2 m s 1 and the minimum relative humidity differ from 45 based on eq 1 the total amounts of irrigation water applied for 1 00 etc were 571 0 and 565 0 mm ha 1 in first and second seasons respectively these amounts of irrigation water were reduced by 25 0 and 50 0 for the 0 75 and 0 50 etc treatments respectively the irrigation water was applied using surface irrigation system

leaf water potential lwp using the scholander pressure chamber scholander et al 1965 and leaf area la using a leaf area meter li 3100 li cor inc lincoln ne usa leaves were then rehydrated in deionised

forced air oven for 48 h to obtain dry weight dw relative water content rwc and equivalent water thickness ewt were calculated using the following equations 2 rwc fw dw tw dw 100 3 ewt g cm 2 fw dw la after physiological maturity five internal rows in each subplot each 3 m long 2 25 m2 total area were harvested and threshed and the water content in the seed was adjusted to 15 to determine the total grain yield per hectare 2 5 canopy hyperspectral reflectance measurements along with measurement of phenotypic parameters canopy hyperspectral reflectance was measured using a portable asd

1050 to 2500 nm respectively however moving averages were calculated automatically to achieve 1 0 nm width continuous bands measurements were taken within 2 h of solar noon under cloudless conditions using a fiber optic probe with a 25 full conical angle and 2 3 mm diameter the probe was held vertically at approximately 80 cm above the canopy in a nadir position on an adjustable monopod pole to cover the three central rows a spectralon white reference panel labsphere inc north sutton nh was used to calibrate the spectroradiometer and to generate reflected light percentages the calibrations were made before and after reflectance measurements for each sub plot four measurements were taken for each subplot on the three central rows an average of 10 scans calculated automatically was used

860 1640 2130 yao et al 2014 in this study based on the relationship between the original spectral reflectance of the full wavelengths range 350 2500 nm and the tested phenotypic parameters eleven wavelengths were selected to create all possible combinations between pairs of wavelengths as normalized difference spectral indices ndsis based on the following formula 4 ndsi rλ1 rλ2 rλ1 rλ2 where rλ1 and rλ2 are the spectral reflectance at the sensitive wavelengths λ1 and λ2 respectively 2 6 data analysis data for phenotypic parameters lwp rwc ewt and gy were tested using analysis of variance anova appropriate for a randomized complete block split plot design with the irrigation rate and cultivar considered as the main factor and the split factor respectively duncan s test at the 95 probability level was used to compare the differences between the mean values of cultivars irrigation rates and their interactions pearson s correlation coefficient matrix was used to determine the relationship between all phenotypic parameters for each irrigation rate as well as to determine the relationship between the original spectral reflectance of the full wavelength range and phenotypic parameters to select the sensitive wavelengths linear and non linear curve fitting models were used to test the relationships between exiting and novel ndsis as independent variables and the phenotypic parameters as dependent variables the relationships with the highest coefficients of determination r2 were considered as the best fit relationships different statistical parameters were used to evaluate the fit of different models of the predicted and observed values the fitting accuracy was visually assessed from a 1 1 scatter plot of the measured and predicted phenotypic values the statistical parameters included the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse the mean relative error re the amemiya s prediction criterion pc and the intercept and slope of the linear regression between the observed and predicted values of the phenotypic parameters a model with highest values of r2 and slope and lowest values of rmse re and pc was considered as the model of the higher prediction accuracy these statistical parameters were performed with xlstat statistical package vers 2017 4 excel add ins soft sarl new york ny usa the r package lattice from the software r statistics version 3 0 2 r foundation for statistical computing 2013 was used to produce the contour maps partial least square regression plsr was performed with the unscrambler x multivariate data analysis software version 10 2 camo software as oslo the plsr is a technique that specifies a linear relationship between a set of independent variables ndsis and wavelengths and target variables lwp rwc ewt and gy it seeks the sensitive information from reflectance bands or ndsis eleven wavelengths or sixty six ndsis were used as input variables in the plsr the optimum number of plsr factors was identified based on the minimum rmse for cross validation to avoid over fitting or under fitting problems the quality of calibration and validation models was tested through rmse and r2 both for calibration rmsecal and r2 cal and validation rmseval and r2 val 3 results 3 1 variation of phenotypic parameters between irrigation rates and cultivars the all phenotypic parameters of leaf water status leaf water potential lwp relative water content rwc and equivalent water thickness ewt and grain yield per hectare gy were significantly affected by irrigation rates with the values of rwc and gy for 0 75 etc treatment being similar to those of the full irrigation treatment 1 0 etc however when averaged over the two seasons severe water stress treatment 0 50 etc was found to have resulted in decreases in lwp of 35 5 and 78 0 rwc of 13 8 and 22 4 ewt of 35 6 and 52 4 and gy of 19 7 and 31 4 when compared with the 0 75 and 1 00 etc treatments respectively table 1 regardless of irrigation rates the differences in all phenotypic parameters between pavon 76 and sakha 93 were not significant with the drought sensitive cultivar yecora rojo producing the lowest values for these parameters table 1 the interaction between irrigation rate and cultivar had a significant effect on all phenotypic parameters in both growing seasons the differences in all phenotypic parameters between pavon 76 and sakha 93 appeared only under the severe water stress treatment 0 50 etc with the exception of ewt which showed non significant differences between both cultivars in the first season when compared with these two cultivars yecora rojo produced the lowest values for rwc and gy even under the full irrigation treatment 1 00 etc and the values of both parameters for pavon 76 under 0 50 etc were competitive with those of yecora rojo under 1 00 etc table 1 3 2 correlation of phenotypic parameters related to individual irrigation rate the only significant correlation found between phenotypic parameters under the full irrigation treatment 1 00 etc was a positive and strong correlation between gy and rwc with a coefficient of 0 70 table 2 under moderate 0 75 etc and severe water stress 0 50 etc treatments all phenotypic parameters showed a stronger positive or negative correlation with each other with the exception of the correlation between gy and lwp under the 0 75 etc treatment in addition all phenotypic parameters showed a stronger relationship with each other under 0 50 etc compared with 0 75 etc table 2 3 3 correlation between spectral reflectance and phenotypic parameters the relationship between the original spectral reflectance of the full wavelength range 350 to 2500 nm and the tested phenotypic parameters were analyzed using pearson correlation coefficients and the pooled data of years replications irrigation rates and cultivars fig 1 generally the wavelengths in the near infrared nir 700 1300 nm and shortwave infrared swir 1300 2500 nm regions exhibited higher pearson correlation coefficients with all phenotypic parameters than those in the visible vis 400 700 nm region lwp was positively correlated with the wavelengths in the vis and swir regions while the other parameters rwc ewt and gy displayed opposite relations the opposite held true for the wavelengths in the nir region the wavelengths in the three parts of the spectrum vis nir and swir exhibited higher correlation with rwc and gy than the lwp and ewt the wavelength intervals from 708 to 734 nm in the nir region and from 1301 to 1388 nm in the swir were the only two regions that showed no significant correlation with all phenotypic parameters the peaks with the strongest correlations were observed around 351 518 and 687 nm in the vis region 762 974 1100 and 1240 nm in the nir region and 1392 1515 1930 and 2273 nm in the swir region fig 1 3 4 the relationships between wavelengths and phenotypic parameters determined using a contour map to further identify the sensitive band regions in the full wavelength range 350 to 2500 nm the coefficients of determination r2 of the relationships between phenotypic parameters and all normalized difference spectral indices ndsis based on the combination of one wavelength on the horizontal axis wavelength 1 and one wavelength on the vertical axis wavelength 2 were plotted on contour maps which is a two dimensional representation of three dimensional data using the pooled data of years replications irrigation rates and cultivars n 54 fig 2 the relationships between phenotypic parameters and ndsis were determined using the linear regression fits based on r2 wavelengths in the vis region on the vertical axis showed significant relationships with phenotypic parameters when they combined only with wavelengths in the nir region on the horizontal axis wavelengths in the nir region on the vertical axis observed significant relationships with phenotypic parameters when they combined with wavelengths in the swir regions on the horizontal axis the combination of wavelengths in the swir region on both the vertical and horizontal axes showed significant relationships with phenotypic parameters fig 2 the r2 values for the relationships between phenotypic parameters and ndsis were mostly greater than 0 60 when the ndsis were based on the combination of wavelengths in the nir and swir regions on the vertical axis and wavelengths in the swir region on the horizontal axis or based on the combination of wavelengths in the vis region on the vertical axis and wavelengths in the nir region on the horizontal axis yellow color in fig 2 the hotspot regions for r2 values larger than 0 80 were confined between the wavelength interval from 740 to 1240 nm on the vertical axis and the wavelength intervals from 1300 to 1550 nm and 1900 to 2200 nm on the horizontal axis as well as at around 2100 nm on the vertical axis and around 2300 nm on the horizontal axis white color in fig 2 3 5 formulation of novel ndsis to remotely assess phenotypic parameters fifty nine ndsis were constructed in this study using all possible combinations of wavelengths which were identified by the strongest peaks in fig 1 ndsis no 1 59 in table 3 the efficiency of these ndsis in the estimation of phenotypic parameters was compared with seven published spectral reflectance indices sris no 60 66 in table 3 which are sensitive to plant water status the best models of regression and coefficients of determination r2 for the relationships for all data n 54 between phenotypic parameters and these sixty six spectral indices are summarized in table 3 the linear and quadratic polynomial regressions were the best models fitting the relationships between ndsis and lwp and rwc while the exponential regression and quadratic polynomial regressions best modeled the relationships between ndsis and ewt the three types of regression models linear quadratic polynomial and exponential were the best models providing the highest r2 for the relationships between ndsis and gy table 3 generally most ndsis estimated rwc and gy better than lwp and ewt the ndsis that incorporate vis vis or swir vis were poorly correlated with all phenotypic parameters while most ndsis that incorporate nir vis nir nir or swir nir showed strongest relationships with all phenotypic parameters with r2 values for these relationships ranging from 0 50 to 0 68 from 0 58 to 0 81 from 0 54 to 0 69 and from 0 59 to 0 81 for lwp rwc ewt and gy respectively table 3 in addition these ndsis were competitive with the published sris no 60 66 in table 3 in estimating the phenotypic parameters with the moisture stress index msi normalized difference water index 1640 ndwi1640 and ndsi 860 1640 2130 showed strongest relationships with all phenotypic parameters the corresponding r2 for these relationships ranged from 0 65 to 0 66 0 78 to 0 82 0 65 to 0 68 and 0 73 to 0 74 for lwp rwc ewt and gy respectively the water index wi and normalized water index 3 nwi 3 were comparable to the msi ndwi1640 and ndsi 860 1640 2130 in estimating lwp and rwc table 3 3 6 assessment of phenotypic parameters for each irrigation rate using a wide range of ndsis twelve different ndsis eight ndsis constructed in this study and four ndsis published in the literature were selected from the previous 66 ndsis to assess the phenotypic parameters individually for each irrigation rate the relationships between these twelve ndsis and phenotypic parameters are shown in figs 3 6 coefficients of determination r2 values for these relationships depended on irrigation rate and phenotypic parameters all selected ndsis constructed and published ndsis failed to assess lwp and ewt under the full irrigation treatment 1 00 etc all published ndsis msi nwi 3 ndwi1640 and ndsi 860 1640 2130 and two constructed ndsis ndsi 1240 687 and ndsi 2273 1240 also failed to assess gy under the same irrigation rate except ndsi 1240 687 and nwi 3 the other ndsis showed a moderate to strong correlation with rwc under the 1 00 etc treatment r2 0 51 0 70 fig 4 under severe water stress 0 50 etc most selected ndsis were highly correlated with lwp r2 0 74 0 82 and gy r2 0 73 0 89 figs 3 and 6 but showed weak and moderate correlations with rwc r2 0 36 0 69 and ewt r2 0 33 0 67 with the exception of nwi 3 and ndsi 860 1640 2130 which showed a strong relationship figs 4 and 5 under the moderate irrigation rate 0 75 etc most selected ndsis failed to assess ewt while most correlations associated with the other parameters lwp rwc and gy showed moderate to strong correlations figs 3 6 3 7 validation of predictive models for phenotypic parameters based on different ndsis the twelve ndsis which were used to assess the phenotypic parameters for each irrigation rate were also used to predict the measured phenotypic parameters the data of ndsis of the second year were used to predict the measured phenotypic parameters of the first year table 4 shows various statistical parameters for determining the accuracy of the validation of predictive models between the observed and predicted values of the phenotypic parameter see materials and methods a model with highest values of r2 and slope and lowest values of rmse re and pc displayed the beast prediction accuracy the models that fulfilled most criteria of the six statistical parameters were selected for accurate prediction of each phenotypic parameter and presented on a 1 1 scatter plot line fig 7 in general based on the criteria of six parameters different models of the twelve ndsis provided a more accurate estimation of rwc and gy than of lwp and ewt among the twelve ndsis five confirmed the most criteria of the accuracies of the models for each phenotypic parameter fig 7 and table 4 the models based on ndsi no 39 ndsi 1930 974 no 44 ndsi 1930 1100 and no 58 ndsi 762 518 1930 provided accurate estimation of all phenotypic parameters no of ndsis listed in table 3 the four phenotypic parameters can also be estimated effectively from the prediction models based on the ndsi no 56 ndsi 974 518 1392 with the exception of lwp the lwp rwc and gy can also be estimated effectively from the prediction models based on ndsis no 65 ndwi1640 no 32 ndsi 1515 762 and no 23 ndsi 1240 687 respectively the models based on the ndsi no 66 ndsi 860 1640 2130 provided accurate estimation for only lwp and ewt table 4 and fig 7 furthermore the three band ndsis such as ndsis no 56 and no 58 provided accurate estimation of lwp and rwc similar to the two band ndsis but provided more accurate estimation of ewt and gy than the two band ndsis importantly some ndsis formulated in this study such as ndsis no 39 44 56 and 58 provided more accurate estimation of the measured phenotypic parameters than the published ndsis such as ndsis no 62 63 and 65 table 4 3 8 prediction of phenotypic parameters based on wavelengths and ndsis using partial least squares regression plsr with full cross validation the eleven wavelengths selected from fig 1 and sixty six ndsis listed in table 3 as independent data were also used to predict the measured phenotypic parameters using the plsr model the data of spectral reflectance of eleven wavelengths or the data of sixty six ndsis of the second year were used to predict the measured phenotypic parameters of the first year using the pooled data of years replications irrigation rates and cultivars the equation r2 and rmse of the linear validations between the observed and predicted values of all phenotypic parameters are shown in fig 8 in general different models of the spectral reflectance or ndsis provided also a more accurate estimation of rwc and gy than of lwp and ewt as such as the individual ndsi in addition the performance of plsr model was the same and sometimes better than some individual ndsis for assessment of phenotypic parameters table 5 summarizes the statistical parameters of the calibration and validation results of the plsr models for predicting phenotypic parameters based on eleven wavelengths selected from fig 1 and sixty six ndsis listed in table 3 fifty nine ndsis formulated from the eleven wavelengths and seven published ndsis the plsr models were determined for each season across irrigation rates and cultivars as well as for each irrigation rate across two seasons and cultivars table 5 generally increasing the number factors of plsr models tended to decrease rmse and increase r2 and slope of regression in both calibration and validation models an accurate model should have a low rmse value with high values for r2 and slope based on all 14 wavelengths these principles of accurate model were observed in 7 4 and 7 factors of the plsr model for lwp rwc and ewt respectively in the 2nd season as well as in 5 and 4 factors for rwc and ewt for 0 75 etc based on all 66 ndsis these principles were found in 4 and 6 factors for rwc and gy in the 1st season 7 and 7 factors for lwp and ewt in the 2nd season 7 and 5 factors for lwp and rwc for 0 75 etc and 7 and 6 factors for lwp and gy for 0 50 etc respectively in both the calibration and validation models table 5 based on either wavelengths or ndsis the plsr model showed greater modeling and prediction accuracy for phenotypic parameters in the 2nd season than in the 1st season as well as for 0 75 and 0 50 etc than 1 00 etc generally the r2 and slope of regression in the calibration sets were higher than those in the validation sets the opposite held true for rmse interestingly the plsr model failed to predict the lwp ewt and gy in both calibration and validation sets under the 1 00 etc treatment when based on wavelengths as well as lwp and ewt under the same treatment when based on ndsis the validation sets were poorer than the calibration sets for ewt under 0 75 and 0 50 etc when the plsr model was based on wavelengths and ndsis as well as for rwc under 0 50 etc and lwp and ewt in the 1st season when the plsr model was based on ndsis but still showed significant relationships between the measured and predicted values r2 ranged from 0 28 to 0 46 table 5 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between plant water status and crop production crop productivity under deficit irrigation is closely related to plant water status and the latter status is directly influenced by soil water conditions as expected increasing deficit irrigation stress negatively affected the plant water relations which in turn reduced leaf expansion and elongation leaf initiation rates and dry matter accumulation ultimately resulting in significant reduction in final grain yield therefore the assessment of plant water status through monitoring the status of leaf water potential lwp relative water content rwc and equivalent water thickness ewt could provide important insights for enhancing crop productivity under deficit irrigation stress by taking the right decisions of the irrigation scheduling such as when and how much water should be applied rwc is an immediate response to deficit irrigation at the canopy level and thus is widely used for describing the water stress levels chaves et al 2003 chen et al 2016 changes in lwp which provides a good indication of the degree of tissue and cell hydration are synchronously accompanied by the changes in the soil water potential next to the plant roots bellvert et al 2016 elsayed et al 2011 gutierrez et al 2010 drought stress affects ewt before any symptoms appear on the canopy therefore detecting the changes in ewt under deficit irrigation stress provides an early warning signal for water deficit in the soil next to the plant roots ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 zarco tejada et al 2003 this indicates that these three plant water relation parameters could serve as key indicators for providing information about the actual water stress level and thus accurate detection of these parameters could potentially minimize crop irreversible physiological damage and yield loss under deficit irrigation conditions as observed in this study final grain yield gy per hectare gradually decreased with decreasing irrigation rates and was accompanied by parallel reductions in lwp rwc and ewt table 1 this result was also supported by the strong positive and negative correlations between gy and the three plant water relation parameters under moderate 0 75 etc except for lwp and severe 0 50 etc water stress treatments table 2 close relationships between gy and these plant water relation parameters on one side and the strong relationships between each other on the other side suggest that these three plant water status parameters could be used to understand the mechanisms of plant response and adaption to deficit irrigation stress and optimize crop production through right irrigation scheduling 4 2 performance of spectral reflectance for assessment of plant water status and grain yield the relative importance of these three plant water status parameters in improving irrigation water management depends on monitoring their status at frequent times in order to determine irrigation thresholds and implementation of suitable irrigation scheduling fortunately various changes in plant water status which can be induced by deficit irrigation stress generate variability in the canopy spectral reflectance in the range of 400 2500 nm el hendawy et al 2017a therefore many studies have shown significant correlations between different water relation parameters and spectral information of the canopy at different wavelengths which offers the possibility of assessing plant water status in a non destructive and expeditious manner using the spectroradiometer el hendawy et al 2017a elsayed et al 2017 erdle et al 2011 2013 in this study with the exception of the wavelength intervals from 708 to 734 nm and 1301 to 1388 nm all other wavelengths in the three parts of the spectrum showed moderate to strong significant correlations with the three plant water relation parameters and gy r 0 50 0 84 with some clear peaks at around 351 518 and 687 nm in the visible region vis 762 974 1100 and 1240 nm in the near infrared region nir and 1392 1515 1930 and 2273 nm in the shortwave infrared region swir fig 1 these results reveal that these eleven peaks may have some specific roles in the eco physiological process that is directly and indirectly associated with the plant water status therefore building different spectral reflectance indices sris based on these wavelengths could be used effectively to assess the leaf water relation parameters and grain yield interestingly a series of typical wavelengths have been identified in literature at the reflection peaks valleys and inflection points of the canopy spectral reflectance from vis to swir of the spectrum ranges previous studies have shown that the wavebands centered at 540 610 630 680 760 970 1100 1200 1240 1400 1450 1730 1930 2100 2250 and 2500 nm provided insights for estimating different parameters related to plant water status under different irrigation treatments and for different crops cheng et al 2010 curran et al 2001 clevers et al 2008 elsayed et al 2017 yao et al 2014 datt 1999 reported significant negative correlations between the wavelengths intervals of 1120 1870 nm and 1980 2440 nm and ewt kriston vizi et al 2008 reported moderate correlations between the plant water status of mandarin and peach canopies expressed by lwp and reflectance at green 490 580 nm and red 580 760 nm regions sun et al 2008 reported that the wavelengths in the swir region i e 1502 1391 and 1656 nm were also found to be more sensitive to changes in rwc in olive plants exposed to different levels of water stress than other wavelengths in the nir region zhang et al 2012 also found significant correlations r 0 60 between leaf water content and the wavelength intervals of 553 556 nm 689 720 nm 755 842 nm 950 970 nm 1013 1034 nm and 1055 1075 nm under different water stress levels in grass poa pratensis bayat et al 2016 found that the wavelengths at 1400 1516 1870 2225 and 2273 nm exhibited strong relationships with leaf water content under drought stress all the wavelengths listed above other published wavelengths not mentioned here or the wavelengths discovered in this study indicate that the effects of leaf water status on spectral reflectance may include both direct and indirect effects the direct effects which are manifested by the magnitude in spectral reflectance in the swir region are related to the plant water status as well as to leaf biochemical properties that are independent of leaf water status such as sugar cellulose or lignin the indirect effects which are manifested by changes in spectral reflectance in the vis and nir regions are not explained by the spectral properties of plant water status but associated with other vegetation properties such as leaf pigment concentration cell wall air interfaces leaf anatomy and the leaf thickness and structure which are indirect influenced by the state of hydration in the leaf therefore it is feasible to use different wavelengths from the three parts of the spectrum vis nir and swir and incorporate it in the different sris to assess changes in plant water relation parameters and grain yield under different levels of irrigation rates the contour map fig 2 which shows the best coefficients of determination r2 between phenotypic parameters and normalized difference spectral indices ndsis based on linear regression and the data in table 3 which shows the best models of regression and r2 for the relationships between the tested parameters and 55 ndsis constructed from the possible combinations of eleven wavelength peaks and 7 published ndsis reinforce these findings and also show that the ndsis based on nir vs vis nir vs nir swir vs nir and swir vs swir wavelengths showed significant relationships r2 values ranging from 0 50 to 0 81 with the three plant water relation parameters and gy the ndsis based on vis vs vis wavelengths failed to track the changes in these parameters these findings also reinforce the direct and indirect effects of the state of water hydration in the leaf on spectral reflectance features as well as suggest that it is advantageous to construct the ndsis based on combined information from the three parts of the spectrum vis nir and swir to assess plant water relations and crop productivity under a wide range of water irrigation rates furthermore these findings also indicate that to build new ndsis for monitoring plant water relations the ndsis should be established using bands not sensitive to plant water content the absorption of light by water in tissues at these bands is very weak or do not occur which makes them suitable for use as reference bands these bands should be combined with bands sensitive to plant water content and the absorption of light by water in tissues at these bands is moderate or high data from literature allow us to conclude that the ndsis formulated using swir combined with nir combining two wavelengths from the nir regions but the energy of one of them is not absorbed by water in tissues or using nir combined with vis are useful for monitoring the plant water relations for different crops under different levels of water stress bayat et al 2016 ceccato et al 2002 colombo et al 2008 elsayed et al 2011 gao 1996 gutierrez et al 2010 ollinger 2011 elsayed et al 2011 also assessed lwp of wheat under drought stress using the sri r100 r1100 strong correlations between the sri based on the ratio between the water index wi and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and rwc as well as between nwi 3 and lwp of wheat have been reported gutierrez et al 2010 kakani et al 2007 winterhalter et al 2011 successfully identified strong relationships between the water status of wheat and sris based on vis nir regions ruthenkolk et al 2002 also reported that although the ndsis based only on the swir regions delivered favorable relationships with lwp the ndsi based on the nir vis regions were found to be more related to lwp yao et al 2014 successfully estimated ewt in wheat under various water regimes using a three band index r1429 r416 r1865 r1429 r416 r1865 no consistent relationship was found between the photochemical reflectance index pri which is based only on the vis and the water potential of olive plants because pri was strongly affected by canopy structure and soil background suárez et al 2008 different factors affect the measured canopy spectral reflectance affecting the performance of sris for tracking the changes in the measured parameters under different conditions for instance some sris performed the best for tracking the changes in the measured parameters under drought stress conditions but failed to track these changes under well watered conditions and vice versa garriga et al 2017 found that various sris showed the strongest predictive power for assessment of the measured parameters when the data of spectral reflectance for full irrigation and water stress were combined together as compared with the results obtained for individual treatments on the contrary el hendawy et al 2017a reported that various sris failed to track the changes in transpiration rate e when the data of spectral reflectance of different irrigation rates were pooled together whereas they successfully tracked these changes under each irrigation rate elsayed et al 2011 also found that the changes in lwp of wheat can reliably be tracked under either well watered or water stress conditions the results of this study showed that most selected ndsis showed moderate to strong relationships with rwc under the full irrigation rate r2 0 51 0 70 although they failed to assess the lwp and ewt which suggest that the relationships between the ndsis and both lwp and ewt were independent of rwc under full irrigation conditions figs 3 5 however half of the ndsis six out of 12 ndsis showed moderate relationships with gy under full irrigation conditions r2 0 41 0 65 fig 6 although the lwp was tracked effectively by the ndsis under both moderate 0 75 etc and severe 0 50 etc water stress conditions similar to rwc and gy these ndsis showed moderate to strong relationships with ewt under severe water stress conditions only r2 0 43 0 70 fig 5 these results indicate that major changes in ewt did not occur until the plants were exposed to highly water stress conditions and therefore the analyzed ndsis are not able to detect light and moderate changes in ewt under full and moderate irrigation conditions furthermore ewt may be less related to spectral reflectance than to rwc and sometimes lwp the reason for this may be that although the ewt provides information about canopy water content such as the rwc and lwp it is very sensitive to changes in the leaf area of the plant severe water stress is sufficient to notably decrease the plant leaf area thus strong responses of leaf area to severe water stress may also have strong impacts on the canopy spectral reflectance therefore the results of this study suggest that ewt does not directly provide information about water status as such as lwp and rwc because it is dependent of the leaf area of the plant 4 3 validation of predictive models the three water relation parameters lwp rwc and ewt and gy were estimated from the developed predictive models based on the twelve ndsis that are used for tracking changes in these parameters under each irrigation rate interestingly all of these twelve ndsi models provided very good prediction accuracy of all parameters as indicated by the six validation statistics with the prediction of rwc and gy being more accurate than those of lwp and ewt at least five out of the 12 ndsi models were selected for each parameter with very high accuracy because they fulfilled most criteria of the six validation statistics table 4 and fig 7 the new ndsis constructed in this study such as ndsis no 32 39 44 and 49 as well as the published sris such as sris no 62 and 65 which showed very good prediction accuracy with the observed values of all phenotypic parameters combined most relevant swir wavelengths with the most relevant nir wavelengths table 4 the three band indices such as ndsis no 56 58 and 66 also combined swir wavelengths together with nir and vis wavelengths this indicates that most ndsis composed of the nir and swir bands could be used for indirect management of irrigation scheduling through detecting the changes in plant water status the three water relation parameters tested in this study are always used to detect the water status of plants this is because the sensitivity of the ndsis to changes in plant water status depends on the selection of the wavelengths whose energy are weakly and strongly absorbed by water which found always with the nir and swir wavelengths respectively the wavelengths within the swir region are less sensitive to noise caused by the leaf internal structure penetrate less far into the canopy and are more sensitive to changes in plant water status the opposite is true for the wavelengths within the nir region eitel et al 2006 mariotto et al 2013 rapaport et al 2017 as a result the models derived from this study are simple applicable and conforms to the principle of remote sensing in management of irrigation scheduling the results of this study also showed that the tested phenotypic parameters can also be accurately estimated from the prediction models based on the ndsis that incorporate nir vis regions such as ndsi no 5 ndsi 1100 351 or only nir wavelengths such as ndsi no 63 nwi3 r970 r880 r970 r880 these results indicate significant responses of leaf structure photosynthetic efficiency and photosynthetic pigments to deficit irrigation stress therefore it is likely that a cheaper nir vis broadband sensor may be suitable also for detecting vegetation water status under a range of irrigation water levels this assumption is supported by becker and schmidhalter 2017 elsayed et al 2011 gutierrez et al 2010 marino et al 2014 prasad et al 2007 rapaport et al 2017 and ruthenkolk et al 2002 who reported that the nir based indices and nir vis based indices are sufficient to detect the parameters of plant water status such as lwp and rwc and are sufficient to explain a large proportion of the variability in gy the nir wavelengths at 970 and 1100 nm penetrate deeper into the canopy and successfully detect the direct changes in the internal leaf structure caused by water deficit and therefore are also suitable for detecting changes in plant water status however the other wavelengths at 880 and 351 nm are used as a reference because their energy is not absorbed by water 4 4 evaluation of the partial least square regression plsr model although several sris have great potential for detecting the changes in different phenotypic parameters of plants under different environmental conditions most common sris with simple ratios and normalized or combined formulas focus on 2 3 wavelengths only this makes it difficult to build a unified spectral index to cover most associated bands related to the crop biophysical and biochemical parameters as well as to deal with potentially confounding factors several researchers have used plsr to improve the prediction accuracy of phenotypic parameters of plants by using several and different sensitive wavelengths or sris colombo et al 2008 elsayed et al 2017 gislum et al 2004 jin et al 2013 li et al 2014 for instance colombo et al 2008 examined the performance of different sris for estimation of leaf ewt using the model of plsr the results of this study showed that leaf ewt could be successfully estimated through different sris using the plsr model with the mean relative errors between the predicted and the measured values around 19 jin et al 2013 also reported that the plsr model has great potential similar to the three band indices for estimating the leaf water content of winter wheat under water stress conditions using the entire spectral dataset with r2 value of 0 74 and rmse value of 9 82 elsayed et al 2017 also found that the plsr model based on different ndsis improved the estimation accuracy of leaf and canopy rwc of wheat by decreasing the rmse value and increasing the coefficients of determination garriga et al 2017 compared different regression algorithms including plsr with different sris for the estimation of different agronomic parameters of wheat under full irrigation and water stress conditions the results indicated that the plsr model was similar to or better than the individual sris for estimation of gy similarly the results of this study found that the plsr model based on either the data of spectral reflectance of eleven wavelengths selected from fig 1 or the data of sixty six ndsis listed in table 3 was similar to or better than most individual ndsis for estimation of water relation parameters and gy fig 8 plsr was better than the ndsi for estimation of lwp and ewt in the 2nd year and lwp under 0 75 and 0 50 etc treatments especially in the validation datasets table 5 this further confirms that the plsr model includes a wide range of sensitive wavelengths compared to the method of sris 5 conclusion in this study close relationships between gy and three parameters of plant water relations lwp rwc and ewt under moderate and severe water stress conditions suggested that accurate and real time estimation of these three plant water status parameters could be useful for irrigation scheduling and maximizing the water productivity of wheat the observed significant relationships between plant water status parameters and the spectral information of the canopy at different wavelengths identified a series of novel wavelengths and therefore indicate that it is possible to assess changes in plant water status in a non destructive and expeditious manner using the spectroradiometer in this study fifty nine novel ndsis were also developed and the nir vis nir nir swir nir and swir swir based indices were most effective for tracking changes in leaf water status and gy different phenotypic parameters can be estimated from the prediction models based on a series novel ndsis with very high

11089,hyperspectral sensing technique can provide an exact and expeditious manner for effective management of deficit irrigation through assessment of changes in plant water status in a large scale and real time this hypothesis was tested in this study using the hyperspectral signatures of the canopy in the visible vis near nir and shortwave infrared swir to estimate and predict the leaf water status measured here in terms of leaf water potential lwp relative water content rwc and equivalent water thickness ewt and grain yield gy of wheat cultivars exposed to 1 00 0 75 and 0 50 of the estimated evapotranspiration etc results showed that the three parameters of leaf water status exhibited strong correlations with gy under 0 75 except lwp and 0 50 etc treatments this indicates that these parameters can be used as early indicators for management of deficit irrigation based on the relationships between these four phenotypic parameters and original canopy spectral reflectance within 350 2500 nm the sensitive spectral wavelengths that exhibited strong correlations with all parameters existed mainly within the nir and swir regions with peak wavelengths around 351 518 and 687 nm in the vis 762 974 1100 and 1240 nm in the nir and 1392 1515 1930 and 2273 nm in the swir regions these peak wavelengths were used to build new two and three band normalized spectral reflectance indices ndsis the ndsis that combine nir and vis nir and nir swir and nir and swir and swir wavelengths were more effective for tracking changes in leaf water status and gy than those that combine only vis wavelengths the high fit between the observed and predicted values for phenotypic parameters based on twelve newly developed and published ndsis indicates that the most recently developed ndsi models were more precise and accurate and thus could be used for monitoring the changes in leaf water status and wheat production caused by deficit irrigation the performance of partial least square regression plsr based on either eleven wavelengths or different ndsis as a predictive approach was the same and sometimes better than the individual ndsis for assessment of phenotypic parameters the results of spectral reflectance data and plsr tools can serve as rapid and non destructive alternative approaches for monitoring the water status and wheat production and can be used to develop certain spectral indices for management of deficit irrigation in arid regions keywords equivalent water thickness estimated evapotranspiration hyperspectral reflectance leaf water potential phenotyping wavelength selection 1 introduction water shortage currently plagues almost every country in arid and semiarid regions and is one of the key factors for stagnation and decrease of crop production in these regions in addition the global climate change which is synchronously accompanied by low and variable precipitation high evaporation rates and frequent incidences of drought causing water shortage in these regions has already become the rule rather than the exception furthermore most of cropping areas in these regions are irrigated and consumes about 75 of the total available water supply thus gradually shifting from full irrigation to deficit irrigation practices in order to achieve maximum crop production per unit of irrigation water applied rather than emphasizing on production per unit of area represents a plausible solution to deal with this issue el hendawy et al 2017a fereres and soriano 2007 accurate estimation and real time detection of the responses of different plant parameters to deficit irrigation particularly those associated with the plant water status are increasingly required for effective water management in precision agriculture the valuable information provided by the monitoring of plant water status can be used directly or indirectly for different purposes such as assessment of drought indicators understanding the relationships between plant and soil water mapping and monitoring the conditions of plant biosphere processes aiding in yield estimation and making sound decisions related to irrigation scheduling which involve deciding when and how much water should be applied gutierrez et al 2010 peñuelas et al 1994 stimson et al 2005 wang et al 2015 leaf water potential lwp relative water content rwc and equivalent water thickness ewt have been developed and widely used as indicators for monitoring plant water status lwp is used as the standard parameter while rwc is often used as a substitute plant parameter for detecting plant water status clevers et al 2008 elsayed et al 2011 kakani et al 2007 rwc is expressed as a fraction of the water volume for the leaf at full turgidity and has a real physiological meaning because it measures the amount of water available for leaf transpiration and reflects the physiological outcome of cellular water deficit chaves et al 2003 rossini et al 2013 ewt is defined as the ratio between the volume of water and the leaf area danson et al 1992 yao et al 2014 therefore gaining a comprehensive and better understanding of these plant water parameters will play an important role in managing deficit irrigation and sustaining crop production under such conditions the ordinary methods for the measurement of these three plant water status parameters that include measuring the area and fresh weight of the leaves and drying them in an oven are practicable very simple and do not require special expertise nonetheless they are generally time and cost inefficient destructive and tedious fail to fulfill the requirement of real time evaluation and are not feasible when the measurements are made on a large scale importantly some methods provide information on the plant water status such as lwp solely on a single effective leaf such measurements are not only time and cost inefficient but also subject to errors and unrepresentative of the water status of the entire canopy consequently quantitative and instantaneous methods for assessment of these plant parameters are needed to address the aforementioned drawbacks of the conventional measurement methods as well as to advance deficit irrigation regulation in wheat through precision agriculture practices spectral reflectance techniques have been demonstrated to be instantaneous cheap applicable for a large scale and non destructive alternative methods for integrative assessment of several phenotypic parameters under different environmental conditions el hendawy et al 2017a b elsayed et al 2017 gitelson et al 2003 lobos et al 2014 rapaport et al 2017 sun et al 2008 the ground based hyperspectral reflectance technique which detects the spectral reflectance of the canopy from visible vis to shortwave infrared swir has been shown to have a great potential to detect even the slight variations and modifications in biophysical and biochemical characteristics of the canopy therefore it is successfully used to track the changes in plant parameters related to plant water status the possibility of detecting various water related parameters through proximal remote sensing data derives from the fact that canopy reflectance in the near infrared nir 700 1300 nm and the shortwave infrared swir 1300 2500 nm regions is strongly influenced by several internal leaf structural and water content of the canopy the oh bonds in the canopy water strongly absorbs solar radiation in the nir and swir regions with the strong water absorption bands found in the swir region and centered at approximately 1450 1950 2250 and 2500 nm and the weak absorption bands located in the nir region near 970 and 1200 nm bowyer and danson 2004 ceccato et al 2002 seelig et al 2008 wang et al 2009 the canopy spectral reflectance in the nir region is also strongly affected by several internal leaf structural factors such as leaf cuticles intercellular air spaces and the ratio between palisade mesophyll and spongy mesophyll that are strongly associated with the leaf water status although the vis region 400 700 nm does not have water bands previous studies have shown that the wavelengths in this region could indirectly be used to estimate the plant water status through the effects of dehydration on the properties of the leaf pigments carter 1991 vescovo et al 2012 therefore there is also a secondary effect of plant water status on canopy spectral reflectance in the nir and vis regions thus many studies have demonstrated that various parameters related to plant water statuscould be assessed with hyperspectral instruments using different spectral reflectance indices sris based on the wavelengths of the three parts of the electromagnetic spectrum vis nir and swir for example rapaport et al 2017 developed a new index the water balance index wabi r1500 r531 r1500 r531 for monitoring the plant water status and detecting the irrigation scheduling in grapevine vitis vinifera under field conditions several studies have also found that the wavelengths in the nir region are appropriate to detect plant water status and the sris formulated based on nir wavelengths such as the water index wi r970 r900 and different normalized water indices nwi 1 r970 r900 r970 r900 nwi 2 r970 r850 r970 r850 nwi 3 r970 r880 r970 r880 and nwi 4 r970 r920 r970 r920 are better for identifying genotypic differences in plant water content under water limited conditions babar et al 2006 el hendawy et al 2015 gutierrez et al 2010 peñuelas et al 1994 prasad et al 2007 rischbeck et al 2014 zarco tejada et al 2003 estimated the leaf water content in relation to leaf area ewt and dry matter content fuel moisture content fmc using the simple ratio water index srwi r860 r1240 interestingly the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi r900 r680 r900 r680 which is one of the most widely used vegetation indices showed significant correlation with lwp and leaf water content stimson et al 2005 yao et al 2014 successfully estimated ewt in wheat under various water and nitrogen treatments by using a three band index r1429 r416 r1865 r1429 r416 r1865 gaulton et al 2013 found strong correlations between leaf ewt r2 0 80 root mean square error rmse 0 0069 g cm2 and the normalized ratio between 1063 and 1545 nm wavelengths junttila et al 2016 showed that the sris calculated from 690 905 and 1550 nm showed significant correlations with leaf ewt importantly although the strong water absorption bands located in swir are more sensitive to plant water status than the weak water absorption bands located in nir the sris that are used to assess the different parameters related to plant water status are effective when nir and swir wavelengths are combined in order to overcome the sensitivity of swir to the other leaf parameters such as dry matter and internal structure ceccato et al 2001 2002 chuvieco et al 2002 in other words the sris are efficient when measurement bands where water absorption is high and reference bands where the water absorption is weak are included although several sris have great potential for assessing different water related parameters as aforementioned and can easily be calculated these indices focus mostly on 2 3 wavelengths only importantly there are different factors related to the conditions for the measurement the spectral reflectance of the canopy i e crop phenological growth stages cultivars levels of treatments and year influencing the performance of the sris in the assessment of plant parameters additionally most regression analyses used for assessment of plant parameters relies on a single sri and therefore very few sris are applied in published work although hundreds of sris are available lobos and poblete echeverría 2017 therefore there are compelling reasons for integrating multiple sris as a single index for improving prediction analysis in the assessment of plant parameters the advantages of such analysis in the assessment of plant parameters are that 1 the plant parameters can be simultaneously assessed through different types of sris e g simple ratio sr normalized spectral indices ndsis perpendicular vegetation index pvi soil adjusted vegetation index savi and 2 the plant parameters can be simultaneously assessed through a wide range of wavelengths from the three parts of the electromagnetic spectrum multivariate regression analyses including partial least square regression plsr are found to be suitable methods for dealing with a large number of sris as a single index in order to improve the prediction of plant parameters recently plsr has been widely used to estimate and predict different plant parameters for instance plsr based on different normalized sris increased the accuracy estimations of grain yield under field conditions by decreasing rmse and increasing the coefficients of determination r2 elsayed et al 2017 strong and significant relationships were found between the observed and predicted values as well as the validation value of wheat grain yield r2 0 87 rmse 413 kg ha 1 when plsr based on different wavelengths sharabian et al 2014 in general hyperspectral measurements allow various multivariate analyses to deal with the whole spectrum wavelengths and various sris the objectives of this study were to 1 identify most wavelengths within the three regions of the spectrum vis nir and swir that were specifically sensitive to leaf water status lwp rwc and ewt and gy measured for different wheat cultivars under different levels of irrigation 2 utilize these wavelengths for developing new specific normalized spectral reflectance indices ndsis 3 examine the suitability of these new ndsis and published sris for assessment of leaf water status and gy 4 develop and validate prediction models for accurate estimation of leaf water status and gy based on various new and published ndsis and 5 compare the performance of plsr based on either different wavelengths or ndsis for estimating the leaf water status and gy in wheat we propose that developing the new ndsis will help in precise assessment and monitoring of plant water status in semiarid regions and will be useful for irrigation scheduling and maximizing the water productivity of wheat 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and growing conditions this study was

less or greater than 2 m s 1 and the minimum relative humidity differ from 45 based on eq 1 the total amounts of irrigation water applied for 1 00 etc were 571 0 and 565 0 mm ha 1 in first and second seasons respectively these amounts of irrigation water were reduced by 25 0 and 50 0 for the 0 75 and 0 50 etc treatments respectively the irrigation water was applied using surface irrigation system to deliver equal and consistent amounts of water to each experimental unit subplot the main pipe of the irrigation system was equipped with a water meter and distributed to the sub main hoses at each unit and equipped with a manual control valve at each experimental unit 2 3 experimental design and crop management the field experiments were laid out in a randomized complete block split plot design with three main plot irrigation treatments and three subplot cultivar treatments replicated three times each subplot was 4 0 m long and 1 5 m wide 6 0 m2 plot 1 the seeds of each cultivar were planted in ten rows per subplot at a seeding rate of 17 g m 2 all treatments were fertilized with 180 kg ha 1 of ammonium nitrate 33 5 n 60 kg ha 1 of potassium chloride 60 k2o and 90 kg ha 1 of calcium superphosphate 15 5 p2o5 nitrogen fertilizer was applied at seeding tillering and booting stages in three equal doses the entire amount of phosphorus and potassium were applied prior to seeding and at booting stage respectively other field practices such as application of fungicides and herbicides were undertaken to control diseases and weed infestation respectively 2 4 measurements of phenotypic parameters six fully developed leaves from each subplot were collected randomly at the anthesis growth stage at 9 30 12 30 am and immediately weighed for fresh weight fw determination after measuring leaf water potential lwp using the scholander pressure chamber scholander et al 1965 and leaf area la using a leaf area meter li 3100 li cor inc lincoln ne usa leaves were then rehydrated in deionised water in a dark cold room at 5 c for 16 h until they were fully turgid following rehydration each leaf was blotted and immediately weighed to obtain turgid weight tw and then oven dried at 75 c in a forced air oven for 48 h to obtain dry weight dw relative water content rwc and equivalent water thickness ewt were calculated using the following equations 2 rwc fw dw tw dw 100 3 ewt g cm 2 fw dw la after physiological maturity five internal rows in each subplot each 3 m long 2 25 m2 total area were harvested and threshed and the water content in the seed was adjusted to 15 to determine the total grain yield per hectare 2 5 canopy hyperspectral reflectance measurements along with measurement of phenotypic parameters canopy hyperspectral reflectance was measured using a portable asd spectroradiometer field spec fr 350 2500 nm analytical spectral devices inc boulder co usa the spectrum of this instrument is characterized by 1 4 and 2 0 nm sampling intervals from 350 to 1050 nm and 1050 to 2500 nm respectively however moving averages were calculated automatically to achieve 1 0 nm width continuous bands measurements were taken within 2 h of solar noon under cloudless conditions using a fiber optic probe with a 25 full conical angle and 2 3 mm diameter the probe was held vertically at approximately 80 cm above the canopy in a nadir position on an adjustable monopod pole to cover the three central rows a spectralon white reference panel labsphere inc north sutton nh was used to calibrate the spectroradiometer and to generate reflected light percentages the calibrations were made before and after reflectance measurements for each sub plot four measurements were taken for each subplot on the three central rows an average of 10 scans calculated automatically was used for each measurement and the average of four measurements was considered a measured spectrum for a sub plot based on the hyperspectral reflectance data seven existing indices that are effective for assessing plant water status and combined wavelengths from three parts of the spectrum vis nir and swir regions were calculated these indices were the water index wi r900 r970 peñuelas et al 1994 the

860 1640 2130 yao et al 2014 in this study based on the relationship between the original spectral reflectance of the full wavelengths range 350 2500 nm and the tested phenotypic parameters eleven wavelengths were selected to create all possible combinations between pairs of wavelengths as normalized difference spectral indices ndsis based on the following formula 4 ndsi rλ1 rλ2 rλ1 rλ2 where rλ1 and rλ2 are the spectral reflectance at the sensitive wavelengths λ1 and λ2 respectively 2 6 data analysis data for phenotypic parameters lwp rwc ewt and gy were tested using analysis of variance anova appropriate for a randomized complete block split plot design with the irrigation rate and cultivar considered as the main factor and the split factor respectively duncan s test at the 95 probability level was used to compare the differences between the mean values of cultivars irrigation rates and their interactions pearson s correlation coefficient matrix was used to determine the relationship between all phenotypic parameters for each irrigation rate as well as to determine the relationship between the original spectral reflectance of the full wavelength range and phenotypic parameters to select the sensitive wavelengths linear and non linear curve fitting models were used to test the relationships between exiting and novel ndsis as independent variables and the phenotypic parameters as dependent variables the relationships with the highest coefficients of determination r2 were considered as the best fit relationships different statistical parameters were used to evaluate the fit of different models of the predicted and observed values the fitting accuracy was visually assessed from a 1 1 scatter plot of the measured and predicted phenotypic values the statistical parameters included the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse the mean relative error re the amemiya s prediction criterion pc and the intercept and slope of the linear regression between the observed and predicted values of the phenotypic parameters a model with highest values of r2 and slope and lowest values of rmse re and pc was considered as the model of the higher prediction accuracy these statistical parameters were performed with xlstat statistical package vers 2017 4 excel add ins soft sarl new york ny usa the r package lattice from the software r statistics version 3 0 2 r foundation for statistical computing 2013 was used to produce the contour maps partial least square regression plsr was performed with the unscrambler x multivariate data analysis software version 10 2 camo software as oslo the plsr is a technique that specifies a linear relationship between a set of independent variables ndsis and wavelengths and target variables lwp rwc ewt and gy it seeks the sensitive information from reflectance bands or ndsis eleven wavelengths or sixty six ndsis were used as input variables in the plsr the optimum number of plsr factors was identified based on the minimum rmse for cross validation to avoid over fitting or under fitting problems the quality of calibration and validation models was tested through rmse and r2 both for calibration rmsecal and r2 cal and validation rmseval and r2 val 3 results 3 1 variation of phenotypic parameters between irrigation rates and cultivars the all phenotypic parameters of leaf water status leaf water potential lwp relative water content rwc and equivalent water thickness ewt and grain yield per hectare gy were significantly affected by irrigation rates with the values of rwc and gy for 0 75 etc treatment being similar to those of the full irrigation treatment 1 0 etc however when averaged over the two seasons severe water stress treatment 0 50 etc was found to have resulted in decreases in lwp of 35 5 and 78 0 rwc of 13 8 and 22 4 ewt of 35 6 and 52 4 and gy of 19 7 and 31 4 when compared with the 0 75 and 1 00 etc treatments respectively table 1 regardless of irrigation rates the differences in all phenotypic parameters between pavon 76 and sakha 93 were not significant with the drought sensitive cultivar yecora rojo producing the lowest values for these parameters table 1 the interaction between irrigation rate and cultivar had a significant effect on all phenotypic parameters in both growing seasons the differences in all phenotypic parameters between pavon 76 and sakha 93 appeared only under the severe water stress treatment 0 50 etc with the exception of ewt which showed non significant differences between both cultivars in the first season when compared with these two cultivars yecora rojo produced the lowest values for rwc and gy even under the full irrigation treatment 1 00 etc and the values of both parameters for pavon 76 under 0 50 etc were competitive with those of yecora rojo under 1 00 etc table 1 3 2 correlation of phenotypic parameters related to individual irrigation rate the only significant correlation found between phenotypic parameters under the full irrigation treatment 1 00 etc was a positive and strong correlation between gy and rwc with a coefficient of 0 70 table 2 under moderate 0 75 etc and severe water stress 0 50 etc treatments all phenotypic parameters showed a stronger positive or negative correlation with each other with the exception of the correlation between gy and lwp under the 0 75 etc treatment in addition all phenotypic parameters showed a stronger relationship with each other under 0 50 etc compared with 0 75 etc table 2 3 3 correlation between spectral reflectance and phenotypic parameters the relationship between the original spectral reflectance of the full wavelength range 350 to 2500 nm and the tested phenotypic parameters were analyzed using pearson correlation coefficients and the pooled data of years replications irrigation rates and cultivars fig 1 generally the wavelengths in the near infrared nir 700 1300 nm and shortwave infrared swir 1300 2500 nm regions exhibited higher pearson correlation coefficients with all phenotypic parameters than those in the visible vis 400 700 nm region lwp was positively correlated with the wavelengths in the vis and swir regions while the other parameters rwc ewt and gy displayed opposite relations the opposite held true for the wavelengths in the nir region the wavelengths in the three parts of the spectrum vis nir and swir exhibited higher correlation with rwc and gy than the lwp and ewt the wavelength intervals from 708 to 734 nm in the nir region and from 1301 to 1388 nm in the swir were the only two regions that showed no significant correlation with all phenotypic parameters the peaks with the strongest correlations were observed around 351 518 and 687 nm in the vis region 762 974 1100 and 1240 nm in the nir region and 1392 1515 1930 and 2273 nm in the swir region fig 1 3 4 the relationships between wavelengths and phenotypic parameters determined using a contour map to further identify the sensitive band regions in the full wavelength range 350 to 2500 nm the coefficients of determination r2 of the relationships between phenotypic parameters and all normalized difference spectral indices ndsis based on the combination of one wavelength on the horizontal axis wavelength 1 and one wavelength on the vertical axis wavelength 2 were plotted on contour maps which is a two dimensional representation of three dimensional data using the pooled data of years replications irrigation rates and cultivars n 54 fig 2 the relationships between phenotypic parameters and ndsis were determined using the linear regression fits based on r2 wavelengths in the vis region on the vertical axis showed significant relationships with phenotypic parameters when they combined only with wavelengths in the nir region on the horizontal axis wavelengths in the nir region on the vertical axis observed significant relationships with phenotypic parameters when they combined with wavelengths in the swir regions on the horizontal axis the combination of wavelengths in the swir region on both the vertical and horizontal axes showed significant relationships with phenotypic parameters fig 2 the r2 values for the relationships between phenotypic parameters and ndsis were mostly greater than 0 60 when the ndsis were based on the combination of wavelengths in the nir and swir regions on the vertical axis and wavelengths in the swir region on the horizontal axis or based on the combination of wavelengths in the vis region on the vertical axis and wavelengths in the nir region on the horizontal axis yellow color in fig 2 the hotspot regions for r2 values larger than 0 80 were confined between the wavelength interval from 740 to 1240 nm on the vertical axis and the wavelength intervals from 1300 to 1550 nm and 1900 to 2200 nm on the horizontal axis as well as at around 2100 nm on the vertical axis and around 2300 nm on the horizontal axis white color in fig 2 3 5 formulation of novel ndsis to remotely assess phenotypic parameters fifty nine ndsis were constructed in this study using all possible combinations of wavelengths which were identified by the strongest peaks in fig 1 ndsis no 1 59 in table 3 the efficiency of these ndsis in the estimation of phenotypic parameters was compared with seven published spectral reflectance indices sris no 60 66 in table 3 which are sensitive to plant water status the best models of regression and coefficients of determination r2 for the relationships for all data n 54 between phenotypic parameters and these sixty six spectral indices are summarized in table 3 the linear and quadratic polynomial regressions were the best models fitting the relationships between ndsis and lwp and rwc while the exponential regression and quadratic polynomial regressions best modeled the relationships between ndsis and ewt the three types of regression models linear quadratic polynomial and exponential were the best models providing the highest r2 for the relationships between ndsis and gy table 3 generally most ndsis estimated rwc and gy better than lwp and ewt the ndsis that incorporate vis vis or swir vis were poorly correlated with all phenotypic parameters while most ndsis that incorporate nir vis nir nir or swir nir showed strongest relationships with all phenotypic parameters with r2 values for these relationships ranging from 0 50 to 0 68 from 0 58 to 0 81 from 0 54 to 0 69 and from 0 59 to 0 81 for lwp rwc ewt and gy respectively table 3 in addition these ndsis were competitive with the published sris no 60 66 in table 3 in estimating the phenotypic parameters with the moisture stress index msi normalized difference water index 1640 ndwi1640 and ndsi 860 1640 2130 showed strongest relationships with all phenotypic parameters the corresponding r2 for these relationships ranged from 0 65 to 0 66 0 78 to 0 82 0 65 to 0 68 and 0 73 to 0 74 for lwp rwc ewt and gy respectively the water index wi and normalized water index 3 nwi 3 were comparable to the msi ndwi1640 and ndsi 860 1640 2130 in estimating lwp and rwc table 3 3 6 assessment of phenotypic parameters for each irrigation rate using a wide range of ndsis twelve different ndsis eight ndsis constructed in this study and four ndsis published in the literature were selected from the previous 66 ndsis to assess the phenotypic parameters individually for each irrigation rate the relationships between these twelve ndsis and phenotypic parameters are shown in figs 3 6 coefficients of determination r2 values for these relationships depended on irrigation rate and phenotypic parameters all selected ndsis constructed and published ndsis failed to assess lwp and ewt under the full irrigation treatment 1 00 etc all published ndsis msi nwi 3 ndwi1640 and ndsi 860 1640 2130 and two constructed ndsis ndsi 1240 687 and ndsi 2273 1240 also failed to assess gy under the same irrigation rate except ndsi 1240 687 and nwi 3 the other ndsis showed a moderate to strong correlation with rwc under the 1 00 etc treatment r2 0 51 0 70 fig 4 under severe water stress 0 50 etc most selected ndsis were highly correlated with lwp r2 0 74 0 82 and gy r2 0 73 0 89 figs 3 and 6 but showed weak and moderate correlations with rwc r2 0 36 0 69 and ewt r2 0 33 0 67 with the exception of nwi 3 and ndsi 860 1640 2130 which showed a strong relationship figs 4 and 5 under the moderate irrigation rate 0 75 etc most selected ndsis failed to assess ewt while most correlations associated with the other parameters lwp rwc and gy showed moderate to strong correlations figs 3 6 3 7 validation of predictive models for phenotypic parameters based on different ndsis the twelve ndsis which were used to assess the phenotypic parameters for each irrigation rate were also used to predict the measured phenotypic parameters the data of ndsis of the second year were used to predict the measured phenotypic parameters of the first year table 4 shows various statistical parameters for determining the accuracy of the validation of predictive models between the observed and predicted values of the phenotypic parameter see materials and methods a model with highest values of r2 and slope and lowest values of rmse re and pc displayed the beast prediction accuracy the models that fulfilled most criteria of the six statistical parameters were selected for accurate prediction of each phenotypic parameter and presented on a 1 1 scatter plot line fig 7 in general based on the criteria of six parameters different models of the twelve ndsis provided a more accurate estimation of rwc and gy than of lwp and ewt among the twelve ndsis five confirmed the most criteria of the accuracies of the models for each phenotypic parameter fig 7 and table 4 the models based on ndsi no 39 ndsi 1930 974 no 44 ndsi 1930 1100 and no 58 ndsi 762 518 1930 provided accurate estimation of all phenotypic parameters no of ndsis listed in table 3 the four phenotypic parameters can also be estimated effectively from the prediction models based on the ndsi no 56 ndsi 974 518 1392 with the exception of lwp the lwp rwc and gy can also be estimated effectively from the prediction models based on ndsis no 65 ndwi1640 no 32 ndsi 1515 762 and no 23 ndsi 1240 687 respectively the models based on the ndsi no 66 ndsi 860 1640 2130 provided accurate estimation for only lwp and ewt table 4 and fig 7 furthermore the three band ndsis such as ndsis no 56 and no 58 provided accurate estimation of lwp and rwc similar to the two band ndsis but provided more accurate estimation of ewt and gy than the two band ndsis importantly some ndsis formulated in this study such as ndsis no 39 44 56 and 58 provided more accurate estimation of the measured phenotypic parameters than the published ndsis such as ndsis no 62 63 and 65 table 4 3 8 prediction of phenotypic parameters based on wavelengths and ndsis using partial least squares regression plsr with full cross validation the eleven wavelengths selected from fig 1 and sixty six ndsis listed in table 3 as independent data were also used to predict the measured phenotypic parameters using the plsr model the data of spectral reflectance of eleven wavelengths or the data of sixty six ndsis of the second year were used to predict the measured phenotypic parameters of the first year using the pooled data of years replications irrigation rates and cultivars the equation r2 and rmse of the linear validations between the observed and predicted values of all phenotypic parameters are shown in fig 8 in general different models of the spectral reflectance or ndsis provided also a more accurate estimation of rwc and gy than of lwp and ewt as such as the individual ndsi in addition the performance of plsr model was the same and sometimes better than some individual ndsis for assessment of phenotypic parameters table 5 summarizes the statistical parameters of the calibration and validation results of the plsr models for predicting phenotypic parameters based on eleven wavelengths selected from fig 1 and sixty six ndsis listed in table 3 fifty nine ndsis formulated from the eleven wavelengths and seven published ndsis the plsr models were determined for each season across irrigation rates and cultivars as well as for each irrigation rate across two seasons and cultivars table 5 generally increasing the number factors of plsr models tended to decrease rmse and increase r2 and slope of regression in both calibration and validation models an accurate model should have a low rmse value with high values for r2 and slope based on all 14 wavelengths these principles of accurate model were observed in 7 4 and 7 factors of the plsr model for lwp rwc and ewt respectively in the 2nd season as well as in 5 and 4 factors for rwc and ewt for 0 75 etc based on all 66 ndsis these principles were found in 4 and 6 factors for rwc and gy in the 1st season 7 and 7 factors for lwp and ewt in the 2nd season 7 and 5 factors for lwp and rwc for 0 75 etc and 7 and 6 factors for lwp and gy for 0 50 etc respectively in both the calibration and validation models table 5 based on either wavelengths or ndsis the plsr model showed greater modeling and prediction accuracy for phenotypic parameters in the 2nd season than in the 1st season as well as for 0 75 and 0 50 etc than 1 00 etc generally the r2 and slope of regression in the calibration sets were higher than those in the validation sets the opposite held true for rmse interestingly the plsr model failed to predict the lwp ewt and gy in both calibration and validation sets under the 1 00 etc treatment when based on wavelengths as well as lwp and ewt under the same treatment when based on ndsis the validation sets were poorer than the calibration sets for ewt under 0 75 and 0 50 etc when the plsr model was based on wavelengths and ndsis as well as for rwc under 0 50 etc and lwp and ewt in the 1st season when the plsr model was based on ndsis but still showed significant relationships between the measured and predicted values r2 ranged from 0 28 to 0 46 table 5 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between plant water status and crop production crop productivity under deficit irrigation is closely related to plant water status and the latter status is directly influenced by soil water conditions as expected increasing deficit irrigation stress negatively affected the plant water relations which in turn reduced leaf expansion and elongation leaf initiation rates and dry matter accumulation ultimately resulting in significant reduction in final grain yield therefore the assessment of plant water status through monitoring the status of leaf water potential lwp relative water content rwc and equivalent water thickness ewt could provide important insights for enhancing crop productivity under deficit irrigation stress by taking the right decisions of the irrigation scheduling such as when and how much water should be applied rwc is an immediate response to deficit irrigation at the canopy level and thus is widely used for describing the water stress levels chaves et al 2003 chen et al 2016 changes in lwp which provides a good indication of the degree of tissue and cell hydration are synchronously accompanied by the changes in the soil water potential next to the plant roots bellvert et al 2016 elsayed et al 2011 gutierrez et al 2010 drought stress affects ewt before any symptoms appear on the canopy therefore detecting the changes in ewt under deficit irrigation stress provides an early warning signal for water deficit in the soil next to the plant roots ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 zarco tejada et al 2003 this indicates that these three plant water relation parameters could serve as key indicators for providing information about the actual water stress level and thus accurate detection of these parameters could potentially minimize crop irreversible physiological damage and yield loss under deficit irrigation conditions as observed in this study final grain yield gy per hectare gradually decreased with decreasing irrigation rates and was accompanied by parallel reductions in lwp rwc and ewt table 1 this result was also supported by the strong positive and negative correlations between gy and the three plant water relation parameters under moderate 0 75 etc except for lwp and severe 0 50 etc water stress treatments table 2 close relationships between gy and these plant water relation parameters on one side and the strong relationships between each other on the other side suggest that these three plant water status parameters could be used to understand the mechanisms of plant response and adaption to deficit irrigation stress and optimize crop production through right irrigation scheduling 4 2 performance of spectral reflectance for assessment of plant water status and grain yield the relative importance of these three plant water status parameters in improving irrigation water management depends on monitoring their status at frequent times in order to determine irrigation thresholds and implementation of suitable irrigation scheduling fortunately various changes in plant water status which can be induced by deficit irrigation stress generate variability in the canopy spectral reflectance in the range of 400 2500 nm el hendawy et al 2017a therefore many studies have shown significant correlations between different water relation parameters and spectral information of the canopy at different wavelengths which offers the possibility of assessing plant water status in a non destructive and expeditious manner using the spectroradiometer el hendawy et al 2017a elsayed et al 2017 erdle et al 2011 2013 in this study with the exception of the wavelength intervals from 708 to 734 nm and 1301 to 1388 nm all other wavelengths in the three parts of the spectrum showed moderate to strong significant correlations with the three plant water relation parameters and gy r 0 50 0 84 with some clear peaks at around 351 518 and 687 nm in the visible region vis 762 974 1100 and 1240 nm in the near infrared region nir and 1392 1515 1930 and 2273 nm in the shortwave infrared region swir fig 1 these results reveal that these eleven peaks may have some specific roles in the eco physiological process that is directly and indirectly associated with the plant water status therefore building different spectral reflectance indices sris based on these wavelengths could be used effectively to assess the leaf water relation parameters and grain yield interestingly a series of typical wavelengths have been identified in literature at the reflection peaks valleys and inflection points of the canopy spectral reflectance from vis to swir of the spectrum ranges previous studies have shown that the wavebands centered at 540 610 630 680 760 970 1100 1200 1240 1400 1450 1730 1930 2100 2250 and 2500 nm provided insights for estimating different parameters related to plant water status under different irrigation treatments and for different crops cheng et al 2010 curran et al 2001 clevers et al 2008 elsayed et al 2017 yao et al 2014 datt 1999 reported significant negative correlations between the wavelengths intervals of 1120 1870 nm and 1980 2440 nm and ewt kriston vizi et al 2008 reported moderate correlations between the plant water status of mandarin and peach canopies expressed by lwp and reflectance at green 490 580 nm and red 580 760 nm regions sun et al 2008 reported that the wavelengths in the swir region i e 1502 1391 and 1656 nm were also found to be more sensitive to changes in rwc in olive plants exposed to different levels of water stress than other wavelengths in the nir region zhang et al 2012 also found significant correlations r 0 60 between leaf water content and the wavelength intervals of 553 556 nm 689 720 nm 755 842 nm 950 970 nm 1013 1034 nm and 1055 1075 nm under different water stress levels in grass poa pratensis bayat et al 2016 found that the wavelengths at 1400 1516 1870 2225 and 2273 nm exhibited strong relationships with leaf water content under drought stress all the wavelengths listed above other published wavelengths not mentioned here or the wavelengths discovered in this study indicate that the effects of leaf water status on spectral reflectance may include both direct and indirect effects the direct effects which are manifested by the magnitude in spectral reflectance in the swir region are related to the plant water status as well as to leaf biochemical properties that are independent of leaf water status such as sugar cellulose or lignin the indirect effects which are manifested by changes in spectral reflectance in the vis and nir regions are not explained by the spectral properties of plant water status but associated with other vegetation properties such as leaf pigment concentration cell wall air interfaces leaf anatomy and the leaf thickness and structure which are indirect influenced by the state of hydration in the leaf therefore it is feasible to use different wavelengths from the three parts of the spectrum vis nir and swir and incorporate it in the different sris to assess changes in plant water relation parameters and grain yield under different levels of irrigation rates the contour map fig 2 which shows the best coefficients of determination r2 between phenotypic parameters and normalized difference spectral indices ndsis based on linear regression and the data in table 3 which shows the best models of regression and r2 for the relationships between the tested parameters and 55 ndsis constructed from the possible combinations of eleven wavelength peaks and 7 published ndsis reinforce these findings and also show that the ndsis based on nir vs vis nir vs nir swir vs nir and swir vs swir wavelengths showed significant relationships r2 values ranging from 0 50 to 0 81 with the three plant water relation parameters and gy the ndsis based on vis vs vis wavelengths failed to track the changes in these parameters these findings also reinforce the direct and indirect effects of the state of water hydration in the leaf on spectral reflectance features as well as suggest that it is advantageous to construct the ndsis based on combined information from the three parts of the spectrum vis nir and swir to assess plant water relations and crop productivity under a wide range of water irrigation rates furthermore these findings also indicate that to build new ndsis for monitoring plant water relations the ndsis should be established using bands not sensitive to plant water content the absorption of light by water in tissues at these bands is very weak or do not occur which makes them suitable for use as reference bands these bands should be combined with bands sensitive to plant water content and the absorption of light by water in tissues at these bands is moderate or high data from literature allow us to conclude that the ndsis formulated using swir combined with nir combining two wavelengths from the nir regions but the energy of one of them is not absorbed by water in tissues or using nir combined with vis are useful for monitoring the plant water relations for different crops under different levels of water stress bayat et al 2016 ceccato et al 2002 colombo et al 2008 elsayed et al 2011 gao 1996 gutierrez et al 2010 ollinger 2011 elsayed et al 2011 also assessed lwp of wheat under drought stress using the sri r100 r1100 strong correlations between the sri based on the ratio between the water index wi and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and rwc as well as between nwi 3 and lwp of wheat have been reported gutierrez et al 2010 kakani et al 2007 winterhalter et al 2011 successfully identified strong relationships between the water status of wheat and sris based on vis nir regions ruthenkolk et al 2002 also reported that although the ndsis based only on the swir regions delivered favorable relationships with lwp the ndsi based on the nir vis regions were found to be more related to lwp yao et al 2014 successfully estimated ewt in wheat under various water regimes using a three band index r1429 r416 r1865 r1429 r416 r1865 no consistent relationship was found between the photochemical reflectance index pri which is based only on the vis and the water potential of olive plants because pri was strongly affected by canopy structure and soil background suárez et al 2008 different factors affect the measured canopy spectral reflectance affecting the performance of sris for tracking the changes in the measured parameters under different conditions for instance some sris performed the best for tracking the changes in the measured parameters under drought stress conditions but failed to track these changes under well watered conditions and vice versa garriga et al 2017 found that various sris showed the strongest predictive power for assessment of the measured parameters when the data of spectral reflectance for full irrigation and water stress were combined together as compared with the results obtained for individual treatments on the contrary el hendawy et al 2017a reported that various sris failed to track the changes in transpiration rate e when the data of spectral reflectance of different irrigation rates were pooled together whereas they successfully tracked these changes under each irrigation rate elsayed et al 2011 also found that the changes in lwp of wheat can reliably be tracked under either well watered or water stress conditions the results of this study showed that most selected ndsis showed moderate to strong relationships with rwc under the full irrigation rate r2 0 51 0 70 although they failed to assess the lwp and ewt which suggest that the relationships between the ndsis and both lwp and ewt were independent of rwc under full irrigation conditions figs 3 5 however half of the ndsis six out of 12 ndsis showed moderate relationships with gy under full irrigation conditions r2 0 41 0 65 fig 6 although the lwp was tracked effectively by the ndsis under both moderate 0 75 etc and severe 0 50 etc water stress conditions similar to rwc and gy these ndsis showed moderate to strong relationships with ewt under severe water stress conditions only r2 0 43 0 70 fig 5 these results indicate that major changes in ewt did not occur until the plants were exposed to highly water stress conditions and therefore the analyzed ndsis are not able to detect light and moderate changes in ewt under full and moderate irrigation conditions furthermore ewt may be less related to spectral reflectance than to rwc and sometimes lwp the reason for this may be that although the ewt provides information about canopy water content such as the rwc and lwp it is very sensitive to changes in the leaf area of the plant severe water stress is sufficient to notably decrease the plant leaf area thus strong responses of leaf area to severe water stress may also have strong impacts on the canopy spectral reflectance therefore the results of this study suggest that ewt does not directly provide information about water status as such as lwp and rwc because it is dependent of the leaf area of the plant 4 3 validation of predictive models the three water relation parameters lwp rwc and ewt and gy were estimated from the developed predictive models based on the twelve ndsis that are used for tracking changes in these parameters under each irrigation rate interestingly all of these twelve ndsi models provided very good prediction accuracy of all parameters as indicated by the six validation statistics with the prediction of rwc and gy being more accurate than those of lwp and ewt at least five out of the 12 ndsi models were selected for each parameter with very high accuracy because they fulfilled most criteria of the six validation statistics table 4 and fig 7 the new ndsis constructed in this study such as ndsis no 32 39 44 and 49 as well as the published sris such as sris no 62 and 65 which showed very good prediction accuracy with the observed values of all phenotypic parameters combined most relevant swir wavelengths with the most relevant nir wavelengths table 4 the three band indices such as ndsis no 56 58 and 66 also combined swir wavelengths together with nir and vis wavelengths this indicates that most ndsis composed of the nir and swir bands could be used for indirect management of irrigation scheduling through detecting the changes in plant water status the three water relation parameters tested in this study are always used to detect the water status of plants this is because the sensitivity of the ndsis to changes in plant water status depends on the selection of the wavelengths whose energy are weakly and strongly absorbed by water which found always with the nir and swir wavelengths respectively the wavelengths within the swir region are less sensitive to noise caused by the leaf internal structure penetrate less far into the canopy and are more sensitive to changes in plant water status the opposite is true for the wavelengths within the nir region eitel et al 2006 mariotto et al 2013 rapaport et al 2017 as a result the models derived from this study are simple applicable and conforms to the principle of remote sensing in management of irrigation scheduling the results of this study also showed that the tested phenotypic parameters can also be accurately estimated from the prediction models based on the ndsis that incorporate nir vis regions such as ndsi no 5 ndsi 1100 351 or only nir wavelengths such as ndsi no 63 nwi3 r970 r880 r970 r880 these results indicate significant responses of leaf structure photosynthetic efficiency and photosynthetic pigments to deficit irrigation stress therefore it is likely that a cheaper nir vis broadband sensor may be suitable also for detecting vegetation water status under a range of irrigation water levels this assumption is supported by becker and schmidhalter 2017 elsayed et al 2011 gutierrez et al 2010 marino et al 2014 prasad et al 2007 rapaport et al 2017 and ruthenkolk et al 2002 who reported that the nir based indices and nir vis based indices are sufficient to detect the parameters of plant water status such as lwp and rwc and are sufficient to explain a large proportion of the variability in gy the nir wavelengths at 970 and 1100 nm penetrate deeper into the canopy and successfully detect the direct changes in the internal leaf structure caused by water deficit and therefore are also suitable for detecting changes in plant water status however the other wavelengths at 880 and 351 nm are used as a reference because their energy is not absorbed by water 4 4 evaluation of the partial least square regression plsr model although several sris have great potential for detecting the changes in different phenotypic parameters of plants under different environmental conditions most common sris with simple ratios and normalized or combined formulas focus on 2 3 wavelengths only this makes it difficult to build a unified spectral index to cover most associated bands related to the crop biophysical and biochemical parameters as well as to deal with potentially confounding factors several researchers have used plsr to improve the prediction accuracy of phenotypic parameters of plants by using several and different sensitive wavelengths or sris colombo et al 2008 elsayed et al 2017 gislum et al 2004 jin et al 2013 li et al 2014 for instance colombo et al 2008 examined the performance of different sris for estimation of leaf ewt using the model of plsr the results of this study showed that leaf ewt could be successfully estimated through different sris using the plsr model with the mean relative errors between the predicted and the measured values around 19 jin et al 2013 also reported that the plsr model has great potential similar to the three band indices for estimating the leaf water content of winter wheat under water stress conditions using the entire spectral dataset with r2 value of 0 74 and rmse value of 9 82 elsayed et al 2017 also found that the plsr model based on different ndsis improved the estimation accuracy of leaf and canopy rwc of wheat by decreasing the rmse value and increasing the coefficients of determination garriga et al 2017 compared different regression algorithms including plsr with different sris for the estimation of different agronomic parameters of wheat under full irrigation and water stress conditions the results indicated that the plsr model was similar to or better than the individual sris for estimation of gy similarly the results of this study found that the plsr model based on either the data of spectral reflectance of eleven wavelengths selected from fig 1 or the data of sixty six ndsis listed in table 3 was similar to or better than most individual ndsis for estimation of water relation parameters and gy fig 8 plsr was better than the ndsi for estimation of lwp and ewt in the 2nd year and lwp under 0 75 and 0 50 etc treatments especially in the validation datasets table 5 this further confirms that the plsr model includes a wide range of sensitive wavelengths compared to the method of sris 5 conclusion in this study close relationships between gy and three parameters of plant water relations lwp rwc and ewt under moderate and severe water stress conditions suggested that accurate and real time estimation of these three plant water status parameters could be useful for irrigation scheduling and maximizing the water productivity of wheat the observed significant relationships between plant water status parameters and the spectral information of the canopy at different wavelengths identified a series of novel wavelengths and therefore indicate that it is possible to assess changes in plant water status in a non destructive and expeditious manner using the spectroradiometer in this study fifty nine novel ndsis were also developed and the nir vis nir nir swir nir and swir swir based indices were most effective for tracking changes in leaf water status and gy different phenotypic parameters can be estimated from the prediction models based on a series novel ndsis with very high
