21460,the results of a dedicated boundary layer measurement campaign which was conducted by using a 2d ldv system over transitionally rough and irregular marine surfaces in a large flow channel are presented and discussed in this study the experimental campaign aimed to investigate the turbulence statistics for zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layers developed over marine fouling control coatings which represent transitionally rough and irregular surfaces along with hydraulically smooth and fully rough reference surfaces a particular emphasis was placed on the wall outer layer similarity at the same time the main characteristics of the boundary layer flow such as the velocity defect profiles reynolds stresses triple correlations of turbulence velocities skewness distributions and flatness factors were comparatively discussed for six different surfaces the surface roughness properties boundary layer characteristic parameters wake parameters and frictional drag properties were also presented for the tested surfaces along with their roughness functions the outer layer similarity was observed for the surfaces coated with the fouling control coatings in general the current study presented perhaps for the first time in such details the higher order statistics of turbulence for the turbulent boundary layer flow developed over the state of the art marine fouling control coatings keywords zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer transitionally rough surfaces irregular roughness turbulence statistics marine fouling control coatings 1 introduction most of the engineering wall bounded turbulent flows develop under the influence of surface roughness and therefore the turbulent boundary layer over rough surfaces has been a widely studied research topic the most recent and comprehensive reviews on rough wall turbulent boundary layer are those of jimenez 2004 and raupach et al 1991 whilst gad el hak and bushman 2011 give a review of turbulent boundary layers with particular emphasis to the cornerstones and fault lines of the classical theories a considerable amount of the research on rough wall turbulent boundary layer flow pays attention to the roughness effects of regular or geometrically defined two or three dimensional surface roughness types such as arrays of bars spheres or rods woven meshes sandpaper sand grain and cones etc e g perry et al 1969 krogstad and antonia 1999 djenidi et al 1999 akinlade et al 2004 schultz and flack 2005 pailhas et al 2008 schultz and flack 2009 volino et al 2009 brzek et al 2010 wu et al 2019 nevertheless the studies on the irregularly rough walls also grow in number with the works of e g schultz 2004 candries and atlar 2005 wu and christensen 2010 mejia alverez and christensen 2010 bons 2010 ünal et al 2012 flack et al 2016 and busse et al 2017 the observation of jimenez 2004 on the transitionally rough regime which occurs at moderate roughness reynolds number as being the least well understood one still holds its place due to the varying roughness function behaviour and large amount of possibilities to define surface characteristics accordingly there exists a significant amount of effort in the recent literature that looks for a universal behaviour for correlation of surface roughness and frictional drag for this flow regime e g thakkar et al 2017 flack et al 2016 ünal 2015 a review of the different roughness parameters that can be used to determine the equivalent roughness height is given in flack and schultz 2010 whilst the recent study of flack et al 2020 concludes that different surface properties variable skewness rms roughness height effective slope may require different or additional parameters for a roughness function correlation the effect of surface roughness is thought to be limited to the roughness sublayer which is within a few roughness heights from the boundary except the indirect role of roughness on the outer scales therefore outer layer similarity is expected in rough walls according to the wall similarity hypothesis which is an extension of townsend s 1961 1976 reynolds number similarity for turbulent flows the existence of outer layer similarity has been one of the debate topics in rough wall research since the invalidity of wall similarity hypothesis poses a significant challenge in the modelling of wall bounded turbulence based on the literature reviewed in their study raupach et al 1991 conclude that similarity exists in the outer region of the rough wall boundary layer however shortly after that the questioning of the wall similarity began with the study of krogstad et al 1992 who report that the roughness effects extent well into the outer layer since then krogstad and antonia 1994 1999 tachie et al 2000 djenidi et al 2008 and leonardi et al 2003 observed significant differences in the turbulent stresses in the outer region of the boundary layer for types of two dimensional roughness brzek et al 2007 studied the rough wall effects with sand grain roughness over a wide range of reynold numbers and different flow regimes and reported that differences in the roughness geometry result in variation of reynolds stresses on the other hand the findings of flack et al 2005 kunkel and marusic 2006 schultz and flack 2003 2007 flack et al 2007 wu and christensen 2007 and brzek et al 2008 provide support to the existence of outer layer similarity jimenez 2004 attributes the conflicting views on outer layer similarity to the largely varying values of relative roughness height k δ compared to the boundary layer thickness and concludes that outer layer similarity exists if the relative roughness height is small enough k δ 1 50 flack et al 2005 support the conclusion of jimenez 2004 while they state that a criterion based on equivalent sand roughness is observed to represent this limit better on the other hand bakken et al 2005 report that the roughness effects are confined to the inner region in internal flows and argue that the confusing results are due to the difference in the outer boundary condition of internal and external flows connelly et al 2006 report experimental results on flat plates over a wide range of relative roughness heights 1 16 k δ 1 110 which expands the validity of outer layer similarity for mean flow variables castro 2007 and flack et al 2007 also suggest outer layer similarity at even higher values of relative roughness height moreover volino et al 2007 and flores and jimenez 2006 experimentally and numerically studied wall roughness effects and found similarity in the turbulence structure the common property of the studies that report outer layer similarity is being confined to the effects of three dimensional k type roughness most studies e g keirsbulck et al 2002 djenidi et al 2008 lee and sung 2007 volino et al 2009 that focus on the two dimensional roughness effects report differences in the outer layer that contradicts with the wall similarity squire et al 2016 notes that there exists a tendency to look for outer layer similarity in the literature where it may not be expected such as rough surfaces with large length scales parallel to the wall and or highly anisotropic surface conditions as in e g volino et al 2011 and anderson et al 2015 busse and jelly 2020 investigate the effect of surface anisotropy by using direct numerical simulation dns modelling for channel flow on the other hand large eddy simulation les and dns modelling of flow over irregular surface roughness pave the way for better understanding of near wall behaviour marchis et al 2019 busse et al 2017 macdonald et al 2016 kuwata and kawaguchi 2019 however there still exists a lack of data especially for the information on the higher order turbulence statistics for turbulent boundary layers developed over transitionally rough and irregular surfaces although the third order moments or triple correlations may be a more sensitive indicator of the wall roughness effect in order to improve the above mentioned lack of data with the associated investigation dedicated experimental research was conducted in the emerson cavitation tunnel to investigate the turbulence statistics for zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layers developed over the marine fouling control coatings this paper presents the details and results of this test campaign by measuring the boundary layer flow using 2d ldv system over transitionally rough irregular surfaces along with smooth and fully rough references therefore following this introduction section 2 of the paper presents the experimental details of the study and uncertainty analysis while section 3 includes the results and discussions of the experiments finally a set of concluding remarks based on the study is presented in section 5 of the paper 2 experimental set up and uncertainty analysis a set of zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer experiments was carried out by using 2 dimensional dantec laser doppler velocimetry ldv in the emerson cavitation tunnel of newcastle university six different surfaces were included in the tests which consisted of a 40 sand grit surface sand40 one smooth reference surface made of acrylic acrylic and four surfaces coated with the state of the art commercial marine fouling control coatings including spray applied self polishing co polymer spc and foul ing release types applied either by spraying fr or rollering frr the sixt surface was coated with a hard coating hc which is generally used in very large pipe systems in marine environment for antifouling purposes a flat plate testbed with an overall length of 3 924 m was used in the experiments which allowed 600 mm long and 220 mm wide flat plate test specimens to be fitted on it a 36 grid sandpaper with a length of 400 mm was used as a turbulent stimulator following the leading edge of the testing bed to thicken the boundary layer and hasten the transition to fully turbulent flow near the wall a schematic of the testbed can be seen in fig 1 the boundary layer measurements were performed at the midline of the test plates and 500 mm from their leading edges pos1 accordingly a distance of 2724 mm was achieved for the boundary layer growth the measurements were conducted for three freestream velocities 2 m s 4 m s and 6 m s accordingly the length based local reynolds number rex varied between 5 45 106 and 1 63 107 during the tests the 60 mm ldv probe which was used together with a 1 98 ratio beam expander and a 500 mm focal length lens was fixed with 45 rotation angle and 5 tilt angle in order to reduce the uncertainty in the wall normal velocity component seeding particles with a diameter of 2 μm were used in the experiments in order to control the zero pressure gradient condition 2d ldv measurements were performed at 80 different streamwise positions at y 60 mm distance from the test bed wall for inflow velocities of 2 4 and 6 m s prior to the test this leaded to a 400 mm distance parallel to the wall with 5 mm intervals the level of the pressure gradient can be witnessed by the acceleration parameter k which is defined as 1 k υ u e 2 d u e d x where υ is the kinematic viscosity and u e is the streamwise velocity the acceleration parameter stayed below 1 10 8 for the entire test velocities and thus the zero pressure gradient condition is assured during the measurements schultz and flack 2007 flack et al 2007 velocity time data were collected at 56 points which were selected with logarithmically increasing intervals throughout the boundary layer and at one point at the outer flow at 80 mm from the wall for each test case data collection took place for 120 or 200 s at each point leading to large data populations of 30000 50000 at every point depending upon the sampling rate the entire data was collected at the coincidence mode by using overlapping in order to calculate the roughness characteristics of the tested flat plates a series of roughness measurements were performed by using a uniscan osp100 laser profilometer 102 roughness profiles with a length of 91 mm were measured for every tested surface with 25 μm and 0 5 mm spatial resolution in the streamwise direction and transverse direction respectively the roughness amplitude and texture parameters calculated at 2 5 mm cut off length are tabulated in table 1 the roughness parameters listed in table 1 are defined as the largest peak to valley height rt the average roughness height ra the root mean square roughness height rq the skewness sk the kurtosis ku and the mean spacing between profile peaks at the mean line sm the power spectral density functions psd of the surfaces which give an idea of the contribution of different wavelengths on the surface structure are comparatively shown for 2 5 mm cut off length in fig 2 the method of benedict and gould 1996 was used to account for the statistical uncertainty associated with the random sampling and limited sample population for uncertainty analysis on the other hand repetitive tests were performed for the calculation of uncertainty according to coleman and steele 2009 for the calculation of uncertainty due to possible inconsistencies in the experimental setup 95 confidence bounds were used in both uncertainty analysis procedures the average uncertainty levels in the streamwise and transverse velocities are about 0 18 and 7 82 respectively for up to y δ 0 1 and continue decreasing till the end of the boundary layer the mean uncertainty in u and v for y δ 0 15 can be given as 0 12 and 2 48 respectively the average uncertainty percentages for u u v v and u v are 1 30 1 62 and 2 93 respectively between 0 02 y δ 0 5 the average uncertainty in u u v v and u v are 2 01 1 97 and 3 72 respectively for 0 05 y δ the average uncertainty in u u u and v v v can be given as 7 25 and 9 83 for 0 05 y δ 3 results and discussions presented in table 2 are the basic boundary layer parameters of the test cases in this table δ represents the thickness of the boundary layer while δ 1 and θ is the displacement and momentum thicknesses respectively h is the shape factor defined as the ratio of displacement thickness to momentum thickness r e δ 1 and r e θ are the displacement and momentum thickness reynolds numbers respectively the mean freestream velocities u e are also included in the table the general convention for the naming of the test cases is the surface type followed by the test velocity presented in fig 3 are the mean streamwise velocity profiles of the tested surfaces that are plotted in the outer variables the non dimensionalization of the streamwise velocity component u and wall normal distance y are conventionally made using the outer flow velocity u e and the boundary layer thickness δ in this figure the velocity profiles of the sand40 test specimen can easily be distinguished by the highest velocity defect while the others generally collapse within the experimental uncertainty the calculated friction velocities u τ in m s local skin friction drag coefficients c f wake strength π and error in origin ε in mm are presented in table 3 for the test cases it should be noted here that the calculated ε values also include the positioning errors of the probe volume the presented friction velocities and local skin friction drag coefficients are calculated with the velocity profile fitting method vp according to krogstad et al 1992 the wake strength varies between 0 21 and 0 31 for the test cases and no significant difference is observed for the coated test specimens or the fully rough reference surface although some studies report increased wake strength for rough walls e g tani 1988 krogstad et al 1992 keirsbulck et al 2002 akinlade et al 2004 the change in the wake strength observed for rough surfaces was generally attributed to the higher growth rate and more significant entrainment of irrotational fluid in the rough wall boundary layers in the mentioned studies on the other hand the wake strength was reported as 0 55 by coles 1956 and as 0 52 by bandhopadhyay 1987 for zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layers and there exists a difference of about 40 with the ones given in the present study however this difference is related with the inflow properties and are indeed associated with the high streamwise turbulence intensity values of about 4 that were observed just after the outer edge of the boundary layer approximately at y δ 1 6 1 8 brzek et al 2009 observed π values decreasing from 0 66 to 0 02 in the presence of 5 2 freestream turbulence intensity for rough walls moreover candries 2001 reports wake strength values ranging between 0 15 and 0 52 which generally accumulates around 0 3 for smooth coated and rough test surfaces which were tested in the ect with a test set up that is rather similar to the present experiments the roughness functions δ u are also given in table 3 along with the roughness reynolds number k the k values that are presented in the table are calculated according to below relation as given in flack and schultz 2010 2 k 4 43 r q 1 s k 1 37 it is observed from the table that the highest roughness function values were obtained for the sand40 test specimen as expected while frr surface has the highest roughness function values between the coated surfaces the variation of roughness function values with the roughness reynolds number is reported as a plot in erbaş 2019 fig 4 a b and c shows the mean velocity profiles of the tested surfaces at tested free stream velocities of 2 m s 4 m s and 6 m s respectively using inner scaling the viscous velocity profile y u and the logarithmic law for a smooth surface are also included in the figure for comparison it is observed that the smooth reference acrylic surface closely follows the smooth logarithmic law log law line as expected at 2 m s free stream velocity the velocity profiles of the fr spc and hc test specimens almost overlap with that of the acrylic a downwards shift is expected in the velocity profiles due to the increased skin friction drag as a result of the surface roughness in general although a significant shift is not observed for the fr spc and hc test specimens it is seen that their profiles dissociate as the inflow velocity increases which points at the increasing values of roughness functions for these surfaces as the reynold number increases on the other hand the velocity profile of the frr and sand40 surfaces display easily observed larger deviations from the smooth log law the mean velocity profiles of the tested surfaces for various inflow velocities are plotted in fig 5 in velocity defect form both using conventional outer scaling a and rotta scaling b the displacement thickness which is an integral length parameter is used as the outer length scale in rotta scaling clauser 1956 rather than the boundary layer thickness which is difficult to be determined accurately and has a relatively arbitrary definition in this kind of scaling the non dimensionalization includes both the outer and inner velocity scales which are the freestream and friction velocities respectively as a result a very good collapse of the velocity defect profiles is observed throughout the logarithmic and outer part of the boundary layer the excellent collapse of the test cases supports townsend s 1976 hypothesis of reynolds number similarity similar to the works of e g schultz and flack 2007 2009 the collapse in the overlap region of the defect profiles also constitutes as a support to the calculated wake strength values presented in fig 6 are the streamwise reynolds normal stresses u u u τ 2 or u u in inner variables a and outer scaling b for all test cases the results in inner variables imply that the surface roughness of the tested coated and fully rough surfaces alter the u u values being valid from y ε 20 40 when compared to the smooth reference this behaviour is less significant at lower inflow velocities however the effect is more pronounced especially at 6 m s test cases the high peak values near the wall observed at y ε 10 20 which are generally associated primarily with the viscous effects and streamwise vortices grass 1971 jimenez 2004 decrease as the roughness reynolds number increases and totally disappears for the sand40 surface this may be related to the fact that the viscous region and some parts of the inner region are destroyed together with the breakup of the streamwise vortices due to the roughness elements extending further away from the wall for this surface however the rise in u u which begins from y ε 1 and continues up to y ε 15 exists in all the test cases of coated surfaces along with the smooth reference the rise came to rest around 8 0 to 9 5 with a peak located at y ε 10 20 for the coated surfaces and the smooth reference this observation is consistent with the previous works of for example degraff and eaton 2000 brzek et al 2008 and ligrani and moffat 1986 u u values of the test cases are around 3 5 5 0 for y ε 1000 which is also in good agreement with e g brzek et al 2008 schultz and flack 2007 and raupach et al 1991 a lower stress region is apparent for the sand40 surface over the band 25 y ε 300 or y δ 1 15 this region consistently produced lower streamwise fluctuations for all freestream velocities for the sand40 surface compared to the rest of the surfaces this is in accordance with the results documented in schultz and flack 2007 who reported lower u u values in a similar but narrower range for a surface with roughness geometry similar to honed pipe with roughness reynolds number of 26 at 27080 momentum thickness reynolds number this may be attributed to the high streamwise turbulence energy production of fully rough surfaces in these regions ligrani and moffat 1986 in the outer region reynolds number dependence is noticed for the tested surfaces when examined in inner scaling similar reynolds number profiles perfectly collapse within the uncertainty beginning from y ε 400 700 for the coated and smooth surfaces depending upon the inflow velocity and y ε 1000 for sand40 the profiles of wall normal reynolds stresses v v u τ 2 or v v in inner scaling for the smooth and rough surfaces are presented in fig 7 a it was only possible to capture the increasing trend of the profiles for some of the test cases which can be observed up to y ε 50 70 the v v profiles form a band due to the reynolds number dependency it is observed that the profiles of similar reynolds numbers overlap for the smooth coated and rough surfaces and the overall shape of the profiles are nearly identical for the different surfaces a large plateau can be noted in the profiles beginning from y ε 50 the extension of which increases with the increasing reynolds number the plateau forms around v v values of 1 4 1 6 which agrees with the results of brzek et al 2008 the reynolds number effect almost forms three groups of profiles in the outer layer as seen from the figure there exists no distinctive difference between the profiles due to the surface roughness in the overlap and outer region of the boundary layer when they are expressed in inner scaling which supports the wall similarity hypothesis as put forward by e g krogstad et al 2005 raupach et al 1991 schultz and flack 2007 and flack et al 2005 the plot in fig 7 b presents the wall normal reynolds stresses for each test case against normalized wall distance in outer scaling the profiles of the smooth and coated surfaces collapse within the uncertainty however the lower profiles of the sand40 surface for the range y δ 0 15 produce a discrepancy this may be attributed to the effect of a step change in the surface roughness in the present experimental set up according to antonia and luxton 1971 a distance of almost 20 δ from smooth to the rough junction is required to obtain a self preserving nature of turbulence properties for the rough boundary layer on the other hand bandyopadhyay 1987 showed that the sand roughness requires a distance of nearly 35 δ to reach the self preserving state following the step change from smooth to rough accordingly the unexpected low values of the wall normal fluctuations obtained for sand40 may be attributed to the effect of the sudden transition from smooth to rough surface since the measurements were carried out at about 10 δ distance to the beginning of the sand grit the reynolds shear stress u v profiles for the test cases are given in inner scaling a and outer scaling b in fig 8 if the reynolds shear stress profiles in inner scaling are considered it is observed that the profiles form plateaus at the constant stress region with a peak value between 0 95 and 1 04 at approx 30 y ε 500 these peak values also validate the calculated friction velocities since the total shear stress can be assumed to be composed of only reynolds shear stresses in the constant stress region which implies that u v u τ 2 1 there is a reynolds number dependence monitored at the outer layer which also causes the profiles spread out over a comparatively wide band for similar reynolds numbers the reynolds shear stress profiles associated with the smooth coated or rough surfaces form groups by collapsing on each other in the level of uncertainty and no significant difference was observed between the tested surfaces in the outer layer this is in agreement with ligrani and moffat 1986 and schultz and flack 2007 who did not find any influence of roughness on the reynolds shear stresses the reynolds shear stress profiles can alternatively be examined in outer scaling given in fig 8 b similar to the wall normal fluctuations no difference is observed between the coated and smooth surface reynolds shear stress profiles although those of sand40 surface follow a lower trend for y δ 0 15 krogstad et al 1992 and krogstad and antonia 1999 found that the difference in the v v profiles of various rough surfaces were considerable and even more pronouncedly reflected in the reynolds shear stresses in the present experiments the behaviour of the u v profiles of sand40 surface is observed in a very similar manner to that of the v v profiles this discrepancy again can be attributed to the effect of the step change in the surface roughness in the present experimental set up the examination of the mean flow properties along with the normal and shear reynolds stresses indicated that the roughness effects were confined to the inner region of the boundary layer for the transitionally rough surfaces antonia and krogstad 2001 emphasize that the third order moments or triple correlations may be a more sensitive indicator of the wall roughness effect the third order moments of the streamwise and transverse fluctuating velocity components are presented in fig 9 a and b respectively for the test cases in outer scaling the triple correlation of the streamwise fluctuating velocity component represents the average transport of turbulent kinetic energy due to streamwise fluctuations by the turbulent motion in the streamwise direction the triple moments display a weak reynolds number dependence similar to that was noted by murlis et al 1982 the general form of the u u u profiles associated with the smooth and coated surfaces present great similarity to those observed in raupach 1981 raupach et al 1991 and akinlade 2005 whilst the trend of the sand40 profiles is similar to that given in schultz and flack 2007 for a fully rough surface the u u u values of the sand40 surface appear to be higher up to y δ 0 2 present a collapse within the uncertainty between y δ 0 2 and 0 3 followed by a rather rapid approach to value of zero compared to the other cases the u u u profiles of this surface have a minimum value of approximately 2 15 at y δ 0 3 the difference between the rough and smooth walls similar to that observed up to y δ 0 2 was also noted by flack et al 2005 2007 the difference between the smooth and rough surfaces observed until y δ 0 2 are attributed to the reduced frequency of sweep events occurrence of high speed fluid from regions distant from the wall for the smooth walls compared to the rough surfaces resulting in an increase in the turbulent flux of reynolds stresses in the streamwise direction for rough surfaces akinlade 2005 the lack of collapse in the profiles of sand40 with those of the other tested surfaces in the outer region may be related with the strong step effect that the flow over such a highly rough surface encounters in the present experimental set up on the other hand the u u u profiles of the other tested surfaces collapse within the uncertainty in the inner layer while some differences are observed in the outer layer the coated and smooth surface profiles present their minimum points between 2 95 and 4 45 at about 0 5 y δ 0 7 the profiles achieve reasonable collapse beyond this region the variation of the third order moments of the transverse fluctuating velocity component v v v for the tested surfaces at various inflow velocities are given in the plot located at the bottom in fig 9 b in outer scaling this quantity represents the average transport of turbulent kinetic energy due to wall normal fluctuations by the turbulent motion in the transverse direction the values of this triple product are positive throughout the boundary layer for the test cases which imply that the transport of the turbulent kinetic energy occurs away from the wall as expected from a smooth wall and was observed in most of the rough wall studies e g flack et al 2005 raupach et al 1991 akinlade 2005 schultz and flack 2007 however this is in contrast with the findings of antonia and krogstad 2001 who presented negative v v v values over a surface composed of two dimensional rods for a significant portion of the boundary layer this suggests that the orientation of the turbulent kinetic energy transport may depend on the geometrical structure or texture of the surface roughness no such behaviour was observed in the present study the v v v profiles of the coated surfaces show agreement between each other and with the smooth reference acrylic within their experimental uncertainty at the outer layer for y δ 0 6 the triple product values of the coated surfaces and sand40 are slightly lower than those of the smooth surface near the wall up to y δ 0 2 which is in line with the findings of raupach 1981 and flack et al 2007 the profiles of the sand40 surface overlap with those of the coated surfaces near the wall for y δ 0 3 and follow a distinctive trend until they reach to zero outside the boundary layer this behaviour of the fully rough reference may also be attributed to the step effect the distributions of u 2 v and u v 2 quantities which represent the normalized streamwise and wall normal turbulent flux of the reynolds shear stresses respectively are presented in fig 10 a and b respectively the difference in the trends of the sand40 is also observed in these quantities due to the effect coming from the individual wall normal turbulent fluctuations for the fully rough reference a drop in the u 2 v values are encountered near the wall until y δ 0 2 compared to the smooth and coated surfaces a similar trend was also reported by krogstad and antonia 1999 for wire mesh and by akinlade 2005 for wire mesh perforated sheet and sand grain roughness the gradient u 2 v y represents the turbulent diffusion of u 2 in the reynolds stress transport equation of u 2 therefore the reduction of u 2 v values near the wall for the rough surface will lead to a gain in the streamwise reynolds stresses u 2 by the turbulent diffusion while a loss is expected for the smooth and coated surfaces the u 2 v profiles of the coated surfaces display a collapse with those of the smooth wall through the outer layer and support outer layer similarity the general shape of the distribution of this quantity is in agreement with the literature e g flack et al 2005 whilst the location and magnitude of the peak at y δ 0 6 with varying values of 0 75 0 90 according to surfaces are in line with those reported by raupach et al 1991 the u v 2 quantity represents the wall normal turbulent transport of the reynolds shear stresses the general trends in the distribution of u v 2 quantity for smooth and coated surfaces are very similar on the other hand for the sand40 and frr surfaces the u v 2 values near the wall are greater than those of the smooth and other coated surfaces with a change of sign for both of them andreopoulos and bradshaw 1981 and flack et al 2007 noted similar near wall differences for rough surfaces including a change of sign within 10k from the wall they concluded that such differences are associated with strong sweeps near the surface of a rough wall on the other hand the profiles of the smooth and coated surfaces other than frr stay in the negative zone throughout the boundary layer and present minimum values around 0 5 at approximately y δ 0 5 the present findings are in accordance with those of e g flack et al 2007 and raupach 1981 the skewness and flatness factors may provide useful information about the ejection and sweep events occurring in the boundary layer the third and fourth moments of the velocity fluctuations are non dimensionalized with the third or fourth powers of the associated root mean square values of the velocity fluctuations respectively to determine the skewness s and flatness f parameters presented in fig 11 a and b are the distributions of the skewness factors associated with the streamwise su and wall normal sv turbulent velocity fluctuations respectively for the test cases in semi log scales the su values of the smooth and coated surfaces almost perfectly collapse throughout the boundary layer whereas those of the sand40 surface present positive values for y δ 0 07 minimal positive values were also observed in a more restricted part of the near wall region for the higher two reynolds number cases of the coated surfaces the positive skewness values near the rough walls may occur due to the less strict wall normal boundary condition which in turn results in the strong sweep events in which more high momentum fluid is swept into the near wall region grass 1971 flack et al 2007 akinlade 2005 it is observed that the test cases display non zero skewness factors in the overlap and outer regions which indicate the degree of temporal asymmetry of the turbulent fluctuations such as sweep versus ejection or acceleration versus deceleration relatively large negative skewness values occurring in the outer layer imply the existence of deceleration dominated ejection events due to arriving low speed fluid from the wall the overall observations related to the su distribution are in agreement with e g flack et al 2005 if the skewness factors of the wall normal turbulent fluctuations sv which are shown in fig 11 b are considered it is observed that these values are positive through the boundary layer and does not change sign for any of the tested surfaces however lower values are encountered for the sand40 surface very near the wall when compared to the smooth and coated test surfaces this behaviour is associated with the lower triple products of wall normal fluctuations that were observed for this fully rough surface in the same region of the inner layer and reflected the lower rate of transport of v 2 by wall normal fluctuations due to the less strict wall boundary and energy being sucked by the larger cavities between the roughness elements the sand40 surface sv distribution displays higher values at the outer layer which indicates higher asymmetry in the wall normal fluctuations and the higher occurrence of sudden large values of wall normal turbulent velocity bandhopadhyay and watson 1988 and keirsbulck et al 2002 observed significant differences in the wall normal skewness factors between smooth and rough surfaces which extended into the outer layer bandhopadhyay and watson 1988 related the observed differences to the shape of the hairpin vortices which can induce different wall normal motions and thus different wall normal diffusion of turbulence in the rough walls the variations of the flatness factors for the streamwise fu and transverse fv turbulent fluctuations are given in fig 12 a and b respectively the fu values associated with the smooth coated and rough walls collapse well in most of the boundary layer and are slightly lower than the gaussian value of 3 until y δ 0 6 similar observations were reported by flack et al 2005 and bergstrom and akinlade 2005 the fv profiles also overlap for smooth coated and rough surfaces in most parts of the boundary layer with a value of about 3 5 in average however slightly higher values are observed for the sand40 surface both for fu and fv around y δ 0 35 to 0 55 this behaviour may be associated with the occurrence of the low speed fluid that is driven from the low velocity region by large vortical structures the large values of fu that are encountered in the outer region point out the occurrence of intermittent large scale negative fluctuations as a result of the large eddies that transport low speed fluid from the near wall region this property is less emphasized for the fv values and the smaller values of fv compared to fu close to the end of the boundary layer imply that wall normal fluctuations are less intermittent than the streamwise ones 4 concluding remarks the results of two dimensional ldv boundary layer measurements which were conducted over transitionally rough surfaces coated with marine fouling control coatings along with the hydraulically smooth and fully rough reference surfaces were presented the surface roughness measurements of the tested surfaces that were carried out with a laser profilometer and associated characteristics were also included the boundary layer flow measurements were specifically designed for data collection suitable for the investigation of turbulence statistics of this flow as part of this investigation the basic findings of the boundary layer properties such as the integral parameters local skin friction drag coefficients roughness functions turbulent normal and shear stresses were examined in detail following these the higher order moments which included the triple correlations along with the skewness and flatness factors were discussed that are usually not included in the rough wall studies due to the lack of needed accuracy in the statistics a very good collapse of the velocity defect profiles was observed throughout the logarithmic and outer region of the boundary layer in the conventional outer scaling and no significant difference was found in the wake strength values for the smooth reference surface coated surfaces or the fully rough surfaces that supported townsend s 1976 reynolds number similarity as far as the results of reynolds stresses are concerned it was observed that there existed a consistent variation in the streamwise turbulent normal stresses in the buffer region due to the effect of the surface roughness the peak values of the streamwise turbulent normal stresses near the wall decreased as the roughness reynolds number increased and totally disappeared for the fully rough surface since the viscous region and some parts of the inner region were destroyed together with the breakup of the streamwise vortices due to the roughness elements extending further away from the wall at this surface in the outer region reynolds number dependence was noticed for the tested surfaces the profiles for similar reynolds numbers perfectly collapsed within the uncertainty beginning from y ε 400 700 for the coated and smooth surfaces and y ε 1000 for the sand40 surface respectively for the transverse turbulent normal stresses there existed no distinctive difference between the profiles due to the surface roughness in the overlap and outer region of the boundary layer when they were expressed in inner scaling the profiles of the same quantity for the smooth and coated surfaces also collapsed within the uncertainty in outer scaling providing support to the wall similarity concept however those of the sand40 presented a discrepancy with lower values over the range y δ 0 15 which was attributed to the effect of the step change in the surface roughness in the present experimental set up similar behaviour was also observed for the reynolds shear stresses to the authors knowledge the higher order statistics of turbulence were for the first time investigated in the literature for turbulent boundary layer flow developing over surfaces coated with marine fouling control coatings the triple moments of the turbulent velocity components displayed weaker reynolds number dependence the u u u values displayed differences between the rough and smooth walls up to y δ 0 2 which were attributed to the reduced frequency of sweep events for the smooth walls compared to the rough surfaces increasing the turbulent flux of reynolds stresses in the streamwise direction for rough surfaces the v v v values were positive throughout the boundary layer for the test cases which imply that the transport of the turbulent kinetic energy occurs away from the wall the u 2 v and u v 2 profiles of the coated surfaces displayed a collapse with those of the smooth wall through the outer layer and supported outer layer similarity for the sand40 and frr surfaces the u v 2 values near the wall were greater than those of the smooth and other coated surfaces with a change of sign for both of them which are associated with strong sweeps near the surface of a rough wall the different trends of the sand40 were also observed in these quantities due to the reflection of the behaviour of the wall normal turbulent fluctuations the streamwise skewness values of the smooth and coated surfaces almost perfectly collapsed throughout the boundary layer whereas those of the sand40 surface presented positive values for y δ 0 07 which may occur due to the less strict wall normal boundary condition and result in strong sweep events the skewness factors of the wall normal turbulent fluctuations were positive along with the boundary layer and did not change the sign for any of the tested surfaces however lower values were encountered for the sand40 surface very near the wall and higher values at the outer layer these suggest higher asymmetry in the wall normal fluctuations and the frequent appearance of sudden large values of the wall normal turbulent velocity the streamwise flatness factors associated with the smooth coated and fully rough walls collapsed well in most of the boundary layer and their values are slightly lower than the gaussian value of 3 until y δ 0 6 the wall normal flatness factors also overlap for smooth coated and fully rough surfaces in most parts of the boundary layer with a value of about 3 5 on average however slightly higher values were also observed for the sand40 surface both for fu and fv around y δ 0 35 to 0 55 this behaviour may be associated with the occurrence of the low speed fluid that is driven from the low velocity region by large vortical structures credit authorship contribution statement burcu erbaş conceptualization formal analysis investigation writing original draft

21460,the results of a dedicated boundary layer measurement campaign which was conducted by using a 2d ldv system over transitionally rough and irregular marine surfaces in a large flow channel are presented and discussed in this study the experimental campaign aimed to investigate the turbulence statistics for zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layers developed over marine fouling control coatings which represent transitionally rough and irregular surfaces along with hydraulically smooth and fully rough reference surfaces a particular emphasis was placed on the wall outer layer similarity at the same time the main characteristics of the boundary layer flow such as the velocity defect profiles reynolds stresses triple correlations of turbulence velocities skewness distributions and flatness factors were comparatively discussed for six different surfaces the surface roughness properties boundary layer characteristic parameters wake parameters and frictional drag properties were also presented for the tested surfaces along with their roughness functions the outer layer similarity was observed for the surfaces coated with the fouling control coatings in general the current study presented perhaps for the first time in such details the higher order statistics of turbulence for the turbulent boundary layer flow developed over the state of the art marine fouling control coatings keywords zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer transitionally rough surfaces irregular roughness turbulence statistics marine fouling control coatings 1 introduction most of the engineering wall bounded turbulent flows develop under the influence of surface roughness and therefore the turbulent boundary layer over rough surfaces has been a widely studied research topic the most recent and comprehensive reviews on rough wall turbulent boundary layer are those of jimenez 2004 and raupach et al 1991 whilst gad el hak and bushman 2011 give a review of turbulent boundary layers with particular emphasis to the cornerstones and fault lines of the classical theories a considerable amount of the research on rough wall turbulent boundary layer flow pays attention to the roughness effects of regular or geometrically defined two or three dimensional surface roughness types such as arrays of bars spheres or rods woven meshes sandpaper sand grain and cones etc e g perry et al 1969 krogstad and antonia 1999 djenidi et al 1999 akinlade et al 2004 schultz and flack 2005 pailhas et al 2008 schultz and flack 2009 volino et al 2009 brzek et al 2010 wu et al 2019 nevertheless the studies on the irregularly rough walls also grow in number with the works of e g schultz 2004 candries and atlar 2005 wu and christensen 2010 mejia alverez and christensen 2010 bons 2010 ünal et al 2012 flack et al 2016 and busse et al 2017 the observation of jimenez 2004 on the transitionally rough regime which occurs at moderate roughness reynolds number as being the least well understood one still holds its place due to the varying roughness function behaviour and large amount of possibilities to define surface characteristics accordingly there exists a significant amount of effort in the recent literature that looks for a universal behaviour for correlation of surface roughness and frictional drag for this flow regime e g thakkar et al 2017 flack et al 2016 ünal 2015 a review of the different roughness parameters that can be used to determine the equivalent roughness height is given in flack and schultz 2010 whilst the recent study of flack et al 2020 concludes that different surface properties variable skewness rms roughness height effective slope may require different or additional parameters for a roughness function correlation the effect of surface roughness is thought to be limited to the roughness sublayer which is within a few roughness heights from the boundary except the indirect role of roughness on the outer scales therefore outer layer similarity is expected in rough walls according to the wall similarity hypothesis which is an extension of townsend s 1961 1976 reynolds number similarity for turbulent flows the existence of outer layer similarity has been one of the debate topics in rough wall research since the invalidity of wall similarity hypothesis poses a significant challenge in the modelling of wall bounded turbulence based on the literature reviewed in their study raupach et al 1991 conclude that similarity exists in the outer region of the rough wall boundary layer however shortly after that the questioning of the wall similarity began with the study of krogstad et al 1992 who report that the roughness effects extent well into the outer layer since then krogstad and antonia 1994 1999 tachie et al 2000 djenidi et al 2008 and leonardi et al 2003 observed significant differences in the turbulent stresses in the outer region of the boundary layer for types of two dimensional roughness brzek et al 2007 studied the rough wall effects with sand grain roughness over a wide range of reynold numbers and different flow regimes and reported that differences in the roughness geometry result in variation of reynolds stresses on the other hand the findings of flack et al 2005 kunkel and marusic 2006 schultz and flack 2003 2007 flack et al 2007 wu and christensen 2007 and brzek et al 2008 provide support to the existence of outer layer similarity jimenez 2004 attributes the conflicting views on outer layer similarity to the largely varying values of relative roughness height k δ compared to the boundary layer thickness and concludes that outer layer similarity exists if the relative roughness height is small enough k δ 1 50 flack et al 2005 support the conclusion of jimenez 2004 while they state that a criterion based on equivalent sand roughness is observed to represent this limit better on the other hand bakken et al 2005 report that the roughness effects are confined to the inner region in internal flows and argue that the confusing results are due to the difference in the outer boundary condition of internal and external flows connelly et al 2006 report experimental results on flat plates over a wide range of relative roughness heights 1 16 k δ 1 110 which expands the validity of outer layer similarity for mean flow variables castro 2007 and flack et al 2007 also suggest outer layer similarity at even higher values of relative roughness height moreover volino et al 2007 and flores and jimenez 2006 experimentally and numerically studied wall roughness effects and found similarity in the turbulence structure the common property of the studies that report outer layer similarity is being confined to the effects of three dimensional k type roughness most studies e g keirsbulck et al 2002 djenidi et al 2008 lee and sung 2007 volino et al 2009 that focus on the two dimensional roughness effects report differences in the outer layer that contradicts with the wall similarity squire et al 2016 notes that there exists a tendency to look for outer layer similarity in the literature where it may not be expected such as rough surfaces with large length scales parallel to the wall and or highly anisotropic surface conditions as in e g volino et al 2011 and anderson et al 2015 busse and jelly 2020 investigate the effect of surface anisotropy by using direct numerical simulation dns modelling for channel flow on the other hand large eddy simulation les and dns modelling of flow over irregular surface roughness pave the way for better understanding of near wall behaviour marchis et al 2019 busse et al 2017 macdonald et al 2016 kuwata and kawaguchi 2019 however there still exists a lack of data especially for the information on the higher order turbulence statistics for turbulent boundary layers developed over transitionally rough and irregular surfaces although the third order moments or triple correlations may be a more sensitive indicator of the wall roughness effect in order to improve the above mentioned lack of data with the associated investigation dedicated experimental research was conducted in the emerson cavitation tunnel to investigate the turbulence statistics for zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layers developed over the marine fouling control coatings this paper presents the details and results of this test campaign by measuring the boundary layer flow using 2d ldv system over transitionally rough irregular surfaces along with smooth and fully rough references therefore following this introduction section 2 of the paper presents the experimental details of the study and uncertainty analysis while section 3 includes the results and discussions of the experiments finally a set of concluding remarks based on the study is presented in section 5 of the paper 2 experimental set up and uncertainty analysis a set of zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer experiments was carried out by using 2 dimensional dantec laser doppler velocimetry ldv in the emerson cavitation tunnel of newcastle university six different surfaces were included in the tests which consisted of a 40 sand grit surface sand40 one smooth reference surface made of acrylic acrylic and four surfaces coated with the state of the art commercial marine fouling control coatings including spray applied self polishing co polymer spc and foul ing release types applied either by spraying fr or rollering frr the sixt surface was coated with a hard coating hc which is generally used in very large pipe systems in marine environment for antifouling purposes a flat plate testbed with an overall length of 3 924 m was used in the experiments which allowed 600 mm long and 220 mm wide flat plate test specimens to be fitted on it a 36 grid sandpaper with a length of 400 mm was used as a turbulent stimulator following the leading edge of the testing bed to thicken the boundary layer and hasten the transition to fully turbulent flow near the wall a schematic of the testbed can be seen in fig 1 the boundary layer measurements were performed at the midline of the test plates and 500 mm from their leading edges pos1 accordingly a distance of 2724 mm was achieved for the boundary layer growth the measurements were conducted for three freestream velocities 2 m s 4 m s and 6 m s accordingly the length based local reynolds number rex varied between 5 45 106 and 1 63 107 during the tests the 60 mm ldv probe which was used together with a 1 98 ratio beam expander and a 500 mm focal length lens was fixed with 45 rotation angle and 5 tilt angle in order to reduce the uncertainty in the wall normal velocity component seeding particles with a diameter of 2 μm were used in the experiments in order to control the zero pressure gradient condition 2d ldv measurements were performed at 80 different streamwise positions at y 60 mm distance from the test bed wall for inflow velocities of 2 4 and 6 m s prior to the test this leaded to a 400 mm distance parallel to the wall with 5 mm intervals the level of the pressure gradient can be witnessed by the acceleration parameter k which is defined as 1 k υ u e 2 d u e d x where υ is the kinematic viscosity and u e is the streamwise velocity the acceleration parameter stayed below 1 10 8 for the entire test velocities and thus the zero pressure gradient condition is assured during the measurements schultz and flack 2007 flack et al 2007 velocity time data were collected at 56 points which were selected with logarithmically increasing intervals throughout the boundary layer and at one point at the outer flow at 80 mm from the wall for each test case data collection took place for 120 or 200 s at each point leading to large data populations of 30000 50000 at every point depending upon the sampling rate the entire data was collected at the coincidence mode by using overlapping in order to calculate the roughness characteristics of the tested flat plates a series of roughness measurements were performed by using a uniscan osp100 laser profilometer 102 roughness profiles with a length of 91 mm were measured for every tested surface with 25 μm and 0 5 mm spatial resolution in the streamwise direction and transverse direction respectively the roughness amplitude and texture parameters calculated at 2 5 mm cut off length are tabulated in table 1 the roughness parameters listed in table 1 are defined as the largest peak to valley height rt the average roughness height ra the root mean square roughness height rq the skewness sk the kurtosis ku and the mean spacing between profile peaks at the mean line sm the power spectral density functions psd of the surfaces which give an idea of the contribution of different wavelengths on the surface structure are comparatively shown for 2 5 mm cut off length in fig 2 the method of benedict and gould 1996 was used to account for the statistical uncertainty associated with the random sampling and limited sample population for uncertainty analysis on the other hand repetitive tests were performed for the calculation of uncertainty according to coleman and steele 2009 for the calculation of uncertainty due to possible inconsistencies in the experimental setup 95 confidence bounds were used in both uncertainty analysis procedures the average uncertainty levels in the streamwise and transverse velocities are about 0 18 and 7 82 respectively for up to y δ 0 1 and continue decreasing till the end of the boundary layer the mean uncertainty in u and v for y δ 0 15 can be given as 0 12 and 2 48 respectively the average uncertainty percentages for u u v v and u v are 1 30 1 62 and 2 93 respectively between 0 02 y δ 0 5 the average uncertainty in u u v v and u v are 2 01 1 97 and 3 72 respectively for 0 05 y δ the average uncertainty in u u u and v v v can be given as 7 25 and 9 83 for 0 05 y δ 3 results and discussions presented in table 2 are the basic boundary layer parameters of the test cases in this table δ represents the thickness of the boundary layer while δ 1 and θ is the displacement and momentum thicknesses respectively h is the shape factor defined as the ratio of displacement thickness to momentum thickness r e δ 1 and r e θ are the displacement and momentum thickness reynolds numbers respectively the mean freestream velocities u e are also included in the table the general convention for the naming of the test cases is the surface type followed by the test velocity presented in fig 3 are the mean streamwise velocity profiles of the tested surfaces that are plotted in the outer variables the non dimensionalization of the streamwise velocity component u and wall normal distance y are conventionally made using the outer flow velocity u e and the boundary layer thickness δ in this figure the velocity profiles of the sand40 test specimen can easily be distinguished by the highest velocity defect while the others generally collapse within the experimental uncertainty the calculated friction velocities u τ in m s local skin friction drag coefficients c f wake strength π and error in origin ε in mm are presented in table 3 for the test cases it should be noted here that the calculated ε values also include the positioning errors of the probe volume the presented friction velocities and local skin friction drag coefficients are calculated with the velocity profile fitting method vp according to krogstad et al 1992 the wake strength varies between 0 21 and 0 31 for the test cases and no significant difference is observed for the coated test specimens or the fully rough reference surface although some studies report increased wake strength for rough walls e g tani 1988 krogstad et al 1992 keirsbulck et al 2002 akinlade et al 2004 the change in the wake strength observed for rough surfaces was generally attributed to the higher growth rate and more significant entrainment of irrotational fluid in the rough wall boundary layers in the mentioned studies on the other hand the wake strength was reported as 0 55 by coles 1956 and as 0 52 by bandhopadhyay 1987 for zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layers and there exists a difference of about 40 with the ones given in the present study however this difference is related with the inflow properties and are indeed associated with the high streamwise turbulence intensity values of about 4 that were observed just after the outer edge of the boundary layer approximately at y δ 1 6 1 8 brzek et al 2009 observed π values decreasing from 0 66 to 0 02 in the presence of 5 2 freestream turbulence intensity for rough walls moreover candries 2001 reports wake strength values ranging between 0 15 and 0 52 which generally accumulates around 0 3 for smooth coated and rough test surfaces which were tested in the ect with a test set up that is rather similar to the present experiments the roughness functions δ u are also given in table 3 along with the roughness reynolds number k the k values that are presented in the table are calculated according to below relation as given in flack and schultz 2010 2 k 4 43 r q 1 s k 1 37 it is observed from the table that the highest roughness function values were obtained for the sand40 test specimen as expected while frr surface has the highest roughness function values between the coated surfaces the variation of roughness function values with the roughness reynolds number is reported as a plot in erbaş 2019 fig 4 a b and c shows the mean velocity profiles of the tested surfaces at tested free stream velocities of 2 m s 4 m s and 6 m s respectively using inner scaling the viscous velocity profile y u and the logarithmic law for a smooth surface are also included in the figure for comparison it is observed that the smooth reference acrylic surface closely follows the smooth logarithmic law log law line as expected at 2 m s free stream velocity the velocity profiles of the fr spc and hc test specimens almost overlap with that of the acrylic a downwards shift is expected in the velocity profiles due to the increased skin friction drag as a result of the surface roughness in general although a significant shift is not observed for the fr spc and hc test specimens it is seen that their profiles dissociate as the inflow velocity increases which points at the increasing values of roughness functions for these surfaces as the reynold number increases on the other hand the velocity profile of the frr and sand40 surfaces display easily observed larger deviations from the smooth log law the mean velocity profiles of the tested surfaces for various inflow velocities are plotted in fig 5 in velocity defect form both using conventional outer scaling a and rotta scaling b the displacement thickness which is an integral length parameter is used as the outer length scale in rotta scaling clauser 1956 rather than the boundary layer thickness which is difficult to be determined accurately and has a relatively arbitrary definition in this kind of scaling the non dimensionalization includes both the outer and inner velocity scales which are the freestream and friction velocities respectively as a result a very good collapse of the velocity defect profiles is observed throughout the logarithmic and outer part of the boundary layer the excellent collapse of the test cases supports townsend s 1976 hypothesis of reynolds number similarity similar to the works of e g schultz and flack 2007 2009 the collapse in the overlap region of the defect profiles also constitutes as a support to the calculated wake strength values presented in fig 6 are the streamwise reynolds normal stresses u u u τ 2 or u u in inner variables a and outer scaling b for all test cases the results in inner variables imply that the surface roughness of the tested coated and fully rough surfaces alter the u u values being valid from y ε 20 40 when compared to the smooth reference this behaviour is less significant at lower inflow velocities however the effect is more pronounced especially at 6 m s test cases the high peak values near the wall observed at y ε 10 20 which are generally associated primarily with the viscous effects and streamwise vortices grass 1971 jimenez 2004 decrease as the roughness reynolds number increases and totally disappears for the sand40 surface this may be related to the fact that the viscous region and some parts of the inner region are destroyed together with the breakup of the streamwise vortices due to the roughness elements extending further away from the wall for this surface however the rise in u u which begins from y ε 1 and continues up to y ε 15 exists in all the test cases of coated surfaces along with the smooth reference the rise came to rest around 8 0 to 9 5 with a peak located at y ε 10 20 for the coated surfaces and the smooth reference this observation is consistent with the previous works of for example degraff and eaton 2000 brzek et al 2008 and ligrani and moffat 1986 u u values of the test cases are around 3 5 5 0 for y ε 1000 which is also in good agreement with e g brzek et al 2008 schultz and flack 2007 and raupach et al 1991 a lower stress region is apparent for the sand40 surface over the band 25 y ε 300 or y δ 1 15 this region consistently produced lower streamwise fluctuations for all freestream velocities for the sand40 surface compared to the rest of the surfaces this is in accordance with the results documented in schultz and flack 2007 who reported lower u u values in a similar but narrower range for a surface with roughness geometry similar to honed pipe with roughness reynolds number of 26 at 27080 momentum thickness reynolds number this may be attributed to the high streamwise turbulence energy production of fully rough surfaces in these regions ligrani and moffat 1986 in the outer region reynolds number dependence is noticed for the tested surfaces when examined in inner scaling similar reynolds number profiles perfectly collapse within the uncertainty beginning from y ε 400 700 for the coated and smooth surfaces depending upon the inflow velocity and y ε 1000 for sand40 the profiles of wall normal reynolds stresses v v u τ 2 or v v in inner scaling for the smooth and rough surfaces are presented in fig 7 a it was only possible to capture the increasing trend of the profiles for some of the test cases which can be observed up to y ε 50 70 the v v profiles form a band due to the reynolds number dependency it is observed that the profiles of similar reynolds numbers overlap for the smooth coated and rough surfaces and the overall shape of the profiles are nearly identical for the different surfaces a large plateau can be noted in the profiles beginning from y ε 50 the extension of which increases with the increasing reynolds number the plateau forms around v v values of 1 4 1 6 which agrees with the results of brzek et al 2008 the reynolds number effect almost forms three groups of profiles in the outer layer as seen from the figure there exists no distinctive difference between the profiles due to the surface roughness in the overlap and outer region of the boundary layer when they are expressed in inner scaling which supports the wall similarity hypothesis as put forward by e g krogstad et al 2005 raupach et al 1991 schultz and flack 2007 and flack et al 2005 the plot in fig 7 b presents the wall normal reynolds stresses for each test case against normalized wall distance in outer scaling the profiles of the smooth and coated surfaces collapse within the uncertainty however the lower profiles of the sand40 surface for the range y δ 0 15 produce a discrepancy this may be attributed to the effect of a step change in the surface roughness in the present experimental set up according to antonia and luxton 1971 a distance of almost 20 δ from smooth to the rough junction is required to obtain a self preserving nature of turbulence properties for the rough boundary layer on the other hand bandyopadhyay 1987 showed that the sand roughness requires a distance of nearly 35 δ to reach the self preserving state following the step change from smooth to rough accordingly the unexpected low values of the wall normal fluctuations obtained for sand40 may be attributed to the effect of the sudden transition from smooth to rough surface since the measurements were carried out at about 10 δ distance to the beginning of the sand grit the reynolds shear stress u v profiles for the test cases are given in inner scaling a and outer scaling b in fig 8 if the reynolds shear stress profiles in inner scaling are considered it is observed that the profiles form plateaus at the constant stress region with a peak value between 0 95 and 1 04 at approx 30 y ε 500 these peak values also validate the calculated friction velocities since the total shear stress can be assumed to be composed of only reynolds shear stresses in the constant stress region which implies that u v u τ 2 1 there is a reynolds number dependence monitored at the outer layer which also causes the profiles spread out over a comparatively wide band for similar reynolds numbers the reynolds shear stress profiles associated with the smooth coated or rough surfaces form groups by collapsing on each other in the level of uncertainty and no significant difference was observed between the tested surfaces in the outer layer this is in agreement with ligrani and moffat 1986 and schultz and flack 2007 who did not find any influence of roughness on the reynolds shear stresses the reynolds shear stress profiles can alternatively be examined in outer scaling given in fig 8 b similar to the wall normal fluctuations no difference is observed between the coated and smooth surface reynolds shear stress profiles although those of sand40 surface follow a lower trend for y δ 0 15 krogstad et al 1992 and krogstad and antonia 1999 found that the difference in the v v profiles of various rough surfaces were considerable and even more pronouncedly reflected in the reynolds shear stresses in the present experiments the behaviour of the u v profiles of sand40 surface is observed in a very similar manner to that of the v v profiles this discrepancy again can be attributed to the effect of the step change in the surface roughness in the present experimental set up the examination of the mean flow properties along with the normal and shear reynolds stresses indicated that the roughness effects were confined to the inner region of the boundary layer for the transitionally rough surfaces antonia and krogstad 2001 emphasize that the third order moments or triple correlations may be a more sensitive indicator of the wall roughness effect the third order moments of the streamwise and transverse fluctuating velocity components are presented in fig 9 a and b respectively for the test cases in outer scaling the triple correlation of the streamwise fluctuating velocity component represents the average transport of turbulent kinetic energy due to streamwise fluctuations by the turbulent motion in the streamwise direction the triple moments display a weak reynolds number dependence similar to that was noted by murlis et al 1982 the general form of the u u u profiles associated with the smooth and coated surfaces present great similarity to those observed in raupach 1981 raupach et al 1991 and akinlade 2005 whilst the trend of the sand40 profiles is similar to that given in schultz and flack 2007 for a fully rough surface the u u u values of the sand40 surface appear to be higher up to y δ 0 2 present a collapse within the uncertainty between y δ 0 2 and 0 3 followed by a rather rapid approach to value of zero compared to the other cases the u u u profiles of this surface have a minimum value of approximately 2 15 at y δ 0 3 the difference between the rough and smooth walls similar to that observed up to y δ 0 2 was also noted by flack et al 2005 2007 the difference between the smooth and rough surfaces observed until y δ 0 2 are attributed to the reduced frequency of sweep events occurrence of high speed fluid from regions distant from the wall for the smooth walls compared to the rough surfaces resulting in an increase in the turbulent flux of reynolds stresses in the streamwise direction for rough surfaces akinlade 2005 the lack of collapse in the profiles of sand40 with those of the other tested surfaces in the outer region may be related with the strong step effect that the flow over such a highly rough surface encounters in the present experimental set up on the other hand the u u u profiles of the other tested surfaces collapse within the uncertainty in the inner layer while some differences are observed in the outer layer the coated and smooth surface profiles present their minimum points between 2 95 and 4 45 at about 0 5 y δ 0 7 the profiles achieve reasonable collapse beyond this region the variation of the third order moments of the transverse fluctuating velocity component v v v for the tested surfaces at various inflow velocities are given in the plot located at the bottom in fig 9 b in outer scaling this quantity represents the average transport of turbulent kinetic energy due to wall normal fluctuations by the turbulent motion in the transverse direction the values of this triple product are positive throughout the boundary layer for the test cases which imply that the transport of the turbulent kinetic energy occurs away from the wall as expected from a smooth wall and was observed in most of the rough wall studies e g flack et al 2005 raupach et al 1991 akinlade 2005 schultz and flack 2007 however this is in contrast with the findings of antonia and krogstad 2001 who presented negative v v v values over a surface composed of two dimensional rods for a significant portion of the boundary layer this suggests that the orientation of the turbulent kinetic energy transport may depend on the geometrical structure or texture of the surface roughness no such behaviour was observed in the present study the v v v profiles of the coated surfaces show agreement between each other and with the smooth reference acrylic within their experimental uncertainty at the outer layer for y δ 0 6 the triple product values of the coated surfaces and sand40 are slightly lower than those of the smooth surface near the wall up to y δ 0 2 which is in line with the findings of raupach 1981 and flack et al 2007 the profiles of the sand40 surface overlap with those of the coated surfaces near the wall for y δ 0 3 and follow a distinctive trend until they reach to zero outside the boundary layer this behaviour of the fully rough reference may also be attributed to the step effect the distributions of u 2 v and u v 2 quantities which represent the normalized streamwise and wall normal turbulent flux of the reynolds shear stresses respectively are presented in fig 10 a and b respectively the difference in the trends of the sand40 is also observed in these quantities due to the effect coming from the individual wall normal turbulent fluctuations for the fully rough reference a drop in the u 2 v values are encountered near the wall until y δ 0 2 compared to the smooth and coated surfaces a similar trend was also reported by krogstad and antonia 1999 for wire mesh and by akinlade 2005 for wire mesh perforated sheet and sand grain roughness the gradient u 2 v y represents the turbulent diffusion of u 2 in the reynolds stress transport equation of u 2 therefore the reduction of u 2 v values near the wall for the rough surface will lead to a gain in the streamwise reynolds stresses u 2 by the turbulent diffusion while a loss is expected for the smooth and coated surfaces the u 2 v profiles of the coated surfaces display a collapse with those of the smooth wall through the outer layer and support outer layer similarity the general shape of the distribution of this quantity is in agreement with the literature e g flack et al 2005 whilst the location and magnitude of the peak at y δ 0 6 with varying values of 0 75 0 90 according to surfaces are in line with those reported by raupach et al 1991 the u v 2 quantity represents the wall normal turbulent transport of the reynolds shear stresses the general trends in the distribution of u v 2 quantity for smooth and coated surfaces are very similar on the other hand for the sand40 and frr surfaces the u v 2 values near the wall are greater than those of the smooth and other coated surfaces with a change of sign for both of them andreopoulos and bradshaw 1981 and flack et al 2007 noted similar near wall differences for rough surfaces including a change of sign within 10k from the wall they concluded that such differences are associated with strong sweeps near the surface of a rough wall on the other hand the profiles of the smooth and coated surfaces other than frr stay in the negative zone throughout the boundary layer and present minimum values around 0 5 at approximately y δ 0 5 the present findings are in accordance with those of e g flack et al 2007 and raupach 1981 the skewness and flatness factors may provide useful information about the ejection and sweep events occurring in the boundary layer the third and fourth moments of the velocity fluctuations are non dimensionalized with the third or fourth powers of the associated root mean square values of the velocity fluctuations respectively to determine the skewness s and flatness f parameters presented in fig 11 a and b are the distributions of the skewness factors associated with the streamwise su and wall normal sv turbulent velocity fluctuations respectively for the test cases in semi log scales the su values of the smooth and coated surfaces almost perfectly collapse throughout the boundary layer whereas those of the sand40 surface present positive values for y δ 0 07 minimal positive values were also observed in a more restricted part of the near wall region for the higher two reynolds number cases of the coated surfaces the positive skewness values near the rough walls may occur due to the less strict wall normal boundary condition which in turn results in the strong sweep events in which more high momentum fluid is swept into the near wall region grass 1971 flack et al 2007 akinlade 2005 it is observed that the test cases display non zero skewness factors in the overlap and outer regions which indicate the degree of temporal asymmetry of the turbulent fluctuations such as sweep versus ejection or acceleration versus deceleration relatively large negative skewness values occurring in the outer layer imply the existence of deceleration dominated ejection events due to arriving low speed fluid from the wall the overall observations related to the su distribution are in agreement with e g flack et al 2005 if the skewness factors of the wall normal turbulent fluctuations sv which are shown in fig 11 b are considered it is observed that these values are positive through the boundary layer and does not change sign for any of the tested surfaces however lower values are encountered for the sand40 surface very near the wall when compared to the smooth and coated test surfaces this behaviour is associated with the lower triple products of wall normal fluctuations that were observed for this fully rough surface in the same region of the inner layer and reflected the lower rate of transport of v 2 by wall normal fluctuations due to the less strict wall boundary and energy being sucked by the larger cavities between the roughness elements the sand40 surface sv distribution displays higher values at the outer layer which indicates higher asymmetry in the wall normal fluctuations and the higher occurrence of sudden large values of wall normal turbulent velocity bandhopadhyay and watson 1988 and keirsbulck et al 2002 observed significant differences in the wall normal skewness factors between smooth and rough surfaces which extended into the outer layer bandhopadhyay and watson 1988 related the observed differences to the shape of the hairpin vortices which can induce different wall normal motions and thus different wall normal diffusion of turbulence in the rough walls the variations of the flatness factors for the streamwise fu and transverse fv turbulent fluctuations are given in fig 12 a and b respectively the fu values associated with the smooth coated and rough walls collapse well in most of the boundary layer and are slightly lower than the gaussian value of 3 until y δ 0 6 similar observations were reported by flack et al 2005 and bergstrom and akinlade 2005 the fv profiles also overlap for smooth coated and rough surfaces in most parts of the boundary layer with a value of about 3 5 in average however slightly higher values are observed for the sand40 surface both for fu and fv around y δ 0 35 to 0 55 this behaviour may be associated with the occurrence of the low speed fluid that is driven from the low velocity region by large vortical structures the large values of fu that are encountered in the outer region point out the occurrence of intermittent large scale negative fluctuations as a result of the large eddies that transport low speed fluid from the near wall region this property is less emphasized for the fv values and the smaller values of fv compared to fu close to the end of the boundary layer imply that wall normal fluctuations are less intermittent than the streamwise ones 4 concluding remarks the results of two dimensional ldv boundary layer measurements which were conducted over transitionally rough surfaces coated with marine fouling control coatings along with the hydraulically smooth and fully rough reference surfaces were presented the surface roughness measurements of the tested surfaces that were carried out with a laser profilometer and associated characteristics were also included the boundary layer flow measurements were specifically designed for data collection suitable for the investigation of turbulence statistics of this flow as part of this investigation the basic findings of the boundary layer properties such as the integral parameters local skin friction drag coefficients roughness functions turbulent normal and shear stresses were examined in detail following these the higher order moments which included the triple correlations along with the skewness and flatness factors were discussed that are usually not included in the rough wall studies due to the lack of needed accuracy in the statistics a very good collapse of the velocity defect profiles was observed throughout the logarithmic and outer region of the boundary layer in the conventional outer scaling and no significant difference was found in the wake strength values for the smooth reference surface coated surfaces or the fully rough surfaces that supported townsend s 1976 reynolds number similarity as far as the results of reynolds stresses are concerned it was observed that there existed a consistent variation in the streamwise turbulent normal stresses in the buffer region due to the effect of the surface roughness the peak values of the streamwise turbulent normal stresses near the wall decreased as the roughness reynolds number increased and totally disappeared for the fully rough surface since the viscous region and some parts of the inner region were destroyed together with the breakup of the streamwise vortices due to the roughness elements extending further away from the wall at this surface in the outer region reynolds number dependence was noticed for the tested surfaces the profiles for similar reynolds numbers perfectly collapsed within the uncertainty beginning from y ε 400 700 for the coated and smooth surfaces and y ε 1000 for the sand40 surface respectively for the transverse turbulent normal stresses there existed no distinctive difference between the profiles due to the surface roughness in the overlap and outer region of the boundary layer when they were expressed in inner scaling the profiles of the same quantity for the smooth and coated surfaces also collapsed within the uncertainty in outer scaling providing support to the wall similarity concept however those of the sand40 presented a discrepancy with lower values over the range y δ 0 15 which was attributed to the effect of the step change in the surface roughness in the present experimental set up similar behaviour was also observed for the reynolds shear stresses to the authors knowledge the higher order statistics of turbulence were for the first time investigated in the literature for turbulent boundary layer flow developing over surfaces coated with marine fouling control coatings the triple moments of the turbulent velocity components displayed weaker reynolds number dependence the u u u values displayed differences between the rough and smooth walls up to y δ 0 2 which were attributed to the reduced frequency of sweep events for the smooth walls compared to the rough surfaces increasing the turbulent flux of reynolds stresses in the streamwise direction for rough surfaces the v v v values were positive throughout the boundary layer for the test cases which imply that the transport of the turbulent kinetic energy occurs away from the wall the u 2 v and u v 2 profiles of the coated surfaces displayed a collapse with those of the smooth wall through the outer layer and supported outer layer similarity for the sand40 and frr surfaces the u v 2 values near the wall were greater than those of the smooth and other coated surfaces with a change of sign for both of them which are associated with strong sweeps near the surface of a rough wall the different trends of the sand40 were also observed in these quantities due to the reflection of the behaviour of the wall normal turbulent fluctuations the streamwise skewness values of the smooth and coated surfaces almost perfectly collapsed throughout the boundary layer whereas those of the sand40 surface presented positive values for y δ 0 07 which may occur due to the less strict wall normal boundary condition and result in strong sweep events the skewness factors of the wall normal turbulent fluctuations were positive along with the boundary layer and did not change the sign for any of the tested surfaces however lower values were encountered for the sand40 surface very near the wall and higher values at the outer layer these suggest higher asymmetry in the wall normal fluctuations and the frequent appearance of sudden large values of the wall normal turbulent velocity the streamwise flatness factors associated with the smooth coated and fully rough walls collapsed well in most of the boundary layer and their values are slightly lower than the gaussian value of 3 until y δ 0 6 the wall normal flatness factors also overlap for smooth coated and fully rough surfaces in most parts of the boundary layer with a value of about 3 5 on average however slightly higher values were also observed for the sand40 surface both for fu and fv around y δ 0 35 to 0 55 this behaviour may be associated with the occurrence of the low speed fluid that is driven from the low velocity region by large vortical structures credit authorship contribution statement burcu erbaş conceptualization formal analysis investigation writing original draft

maulana azad national institute of technology bhopal india corresponding author savonius hydrokinetic turbine is considered as an environmentally friendly and cost effective turbine to extract hydrokinetic potential available in flowing streams however this turbine has not been fully explored as the solution for the main problem of low efficiency of savonius turbine is still being investigated around the globe in order to study the effect of number of stages this study aims to analyze the performance of modified savonius hydrokinetic turbine having twisted blade under different values of number of stages a commercial unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans solver in conjunction with realizable k ε turbulence model has been used for the numerical analysis pressure and

its high energy concentration and predictability considering the large energy potential of naturally occurring high energy flows viz river stream canal flow and the limited availability of non renewable energy resources hydrokinetic energy could play a pertinent role tampier et al 2017 development of hydrokinetic technology can be described in four phases traditional empirical establishment growth and modern periods van els and brasil 2015 the hydrokinetic technology is capable to meet wide range of energy demands viz instrumentation 101 w to small communities 104 w to regional utilities 108 w forbush et al 2016 although innovative techniques to extract hydrokinetic energy are also being investigated hydrokinetic energy converters can be broadly categorized as turbine type system rotational motion and non turbine type viz oscillatory motion laws and epps 2016 furthermore axial flow horizontal axis turbine and cross flow systems vertical axis turbine are considered as two distinct classes of turbine type systems based on rotor axis alignment with water flow kumar and saini 2016 lee et al 2019 the horizontal axis turbines are predominantly used in tidal energy or marine current energy extraction due to their higher efficiency but these turbines are expensive for small scale energy conversion due to their certain advantages viz design simplicity independency of flow direction and ease of installation the vertical axis turbine is generally preferred over the horizontal axis turbine for small scale power generation saini and saini 2018 moreover these turbines need relatively lesser maintenance as various electrical components can be installed above the free surface of the water khan et al 2009 stated that vertical axis turbines can be installed either as a single unit in small rivers or stacked together in large rivers these certain advantages of vertical axis turbine have encouraged intensive research for the design and development of improved turbine saini and saini 2020a in recent years a number of techniques such as cyclic blade system hwang et al 2009 central deflector amelio et al 2012 flapping blades yang and lawn 2011 yang and lawn 2013 wu et al 2020 flexible foils gundersen 2015 hybrid rotor saini and saini 2020b and variable pitch blade jing et al 2014 have been adopted to improve the efficiency of vertical axis turbine for river tidal and ocean applications one of the most prominent rotor configurations of hydrokinetic turbines is savonius rotor turbine which was design and developed by finish engineer s j savonius in 1920 for wind energy applications fernandes and rostami 2015 it is a drag based energy conversion device which has good starting characteristics at low speed saini and saini 2019 savonius hydrokinetic turbines shts face the problem of poor performance and it is difficult to integrate with a generator because of its low operating speed however it has several advantages such as rotation is independent of fluid flow direction simple to design and manufacture cost effective and less vibration load on the supporting structure unlike the wind flow water flows in a well defined direction this eliminates the need of yaw control mechanism and reduces complexity this improves reliability and reduces maintenance considering the aforementioned advantages savonius hydrokinetic turbine is suitable for the following application small scale standalone hydraulic turbine that can be used to generate electrical power for household applications and for operating water pumps charging batteries powering telecommunications and several other low power applications patel et al 2017 in the recent years a number of studies have been carried out to improve the performance of savonius rotor as wind and water turbine flow field generated by hydrokinetic and wind turbine is quite different because water flow is governed by gravity while wind flow is governed by pressure difference the contours of free surface flow may be changed due to presence of turbine in channel subsequently performance of turbine is affected hence there is need to investigate the effect of different parameters on the performance of savonius rotor working as water turbine kumar and saini 2016 reviewed and presented the parameters which influence of the performance of savonius type hydrokinetic turbine furthermore a number of studies were reported to evaluate the performance of savonius rotor as hydrokinetic turbine as given in table 1 kamoji et al 2008 also carried out experimental investigation to study the effect of number of stages on the performance of savonius wind turbine kamoji et al 2009 also proposed and investigated the modified shape of blade for semicircular profile of single savonius wind turbine golecha et al 2011 carried out experimental investigation on single double and three stage of savonius hydrokinetic turbine having modified shape of blade proposed by kamoji et al 2009 2 objective of the present study the aforementioned investigations highlight that effect of number of stages with twisted blade profile is still not explored for modified savonius hydrokinetic turbine hence there is a need to study the effect of number of stages on the performance of modified savonius hydrokinetic turbine with twisted blades in an open channel flow based on gap identified in earlier studies the objectives of present research are given below i to study the effect of a number of stages on the performance of the modified savonius hydrokinetic turbine having twisted blades for different values of reynolds number ii to develop a correlation for power coefficient in terms of tsr number of stages and reynolds number using commercial available software fluent unsteady and rotating 3d cfd simulations are carried out in present study to evaluate the effect of number of stages for hydrokinetic turbine 3 selection of design parameters of savonius turbine and open channel under the present study the performance parameters considered are number of stages st and reynolds number the conventional savonius turbine with geometrical changes in the blade shape has been referred to as modified savonius turbine the blades shape of the conventional savonius rotor is altered by taking blade arc angle ψ and blade shape factor p q kumar and saini 2017b the blade arc angle refers the reduction in curvature profile of blade which assist in the reduction of backward drag force the blade shape factor is the measure of the reduction of inner curvature near rotor shaft which results in reduction of energy losses during rotation on the other hand the twist angle refers the angle throughout the length height of the blade instead of straight line the twist angle provides the uniform gliding of water over the blade profile which results in reduction of torque fluctuations fig 1 a shows the top view of modified blade shape while fig 1 b graphical representation of twisted blade profile front view schematic of single stage double stage and three stage turbine are also illustrated in fig 1 c fig 1 d and fig 1 e respectively two blade savonius rotor having zero overlap ratio and aspect ratio h d of 1 51 is considered for the numerical investigations based on earlier studies kumar and saini 2017a 2017b turbine having twist angle α of 12 5 blade arc angle ψ of 150 and blade shape factor p q of 0 6 are considered as modified savonius hydrokinetic turbine having twisted blade table 2 gives details of rotor diameter rotor height stage height stage aspect ratio and rotor aspect ratio of modified savonius hydrokinetic turbine having twisted blades diameter of end plate is taken 10 larger than diameter of rotor diameter and no shaft is considered between the end plates kamoji et al 2009 for numerical investigations the turbine is considered to be submerged completely in the open channel the open channel having rectangular cross section of 0 55 m 0 65 m for a length of 3 0 m is considered under the present study the turbine is placed at distance of 1 5 m from the inlet of open channel effect of boundary proximity i e distance between turbine and around walls on the performance of turbine has not been considered under the present study therefore turbine position inside the channel at equal distance from the walls and channel blockage ratio of 11 8 has been kept constant the range of reynolds number is considered as 9 38 104 to 37 52 104 which corresponds to 0 5 m s to 2 m s range of tsr has been considered as 0 5 1 0 for a typical value of rotor diameter and flow velocity or reynolds number 4 numerical investigation 4 1 3d modelling of computational domain a 3d model of multi stage savonius hydrokinetic turbine is created using ansys design modeler as per aforementioned parameters three dimensional model of turbine for one two and three stage are shown in fig 2 a computational domain which represents open channel is also modeled for cfd study this domain is divided into sub domains i e stationary zone and rotating zone to generate the rotating zone cylindrical volume enclosing turbine is created about z axis the circumference of the cylindrical volume is set as an interface to make sure the continuity of the flow field fig 3 shows the complete computational domain where z axis is rotation axis of the turbine 4 2 mesh generation the mesh generation of computational domain is crucial step which is generated in ansys mesh using non conformal unstructured grid of tetrahedral elements fig 4 shows the discretization of the rotating zones for single double and three stage in order to effectively capture the flow field and boundary layer formations mesh is refined at the blade surface by providing the inflations layers as shown in fig 5 under earlier studies zhou and rempfer 2013 tian et al 2016 to apply the realizable k ε turbulence model y value less than one was recommended to fix the height of first cell thickness above the blade surface accordingly the value of y has been considered as less than one under the present investigation various mesh quality parameters viz aspect ratio 16 skewness 0 22 and orthogonal quality 0 21 were monitored and are found to be in good agreement 4 3 turbulence model and boundary conditions computational mesh is imported to ansys fluent v 15 0 to solve unsteady incompressible navier stokes equations in order to resemble the turbine rotation under actual operating conditions transient unsteady numerical simulations have been performed and appropriate turbulence model along with necessary boundary conditions are employed the published experimental results for a classical savonius turbine has been compared with results of employed turbulence models to study the effect of turbulence model as shown in fig 6 hayashi et al 2005 the good agreement has been found between results of cfd and experiments for power coefficient when using the realizable k ε turbulence model as shown in fig 6 therefore the realizable k ε model has been considered under present numerical simulations the selection of boundary conditions is shown in fig 7 under the present study it is assumed that turbine operates with complete submerged conditions in order to reduce the surface effect therefore top of the domain is assigned with symmetry condition sarma et al 2014 the extreme right boundary in y direction has been set as outflow condition for channel outlet sarma et al 2014 kolekar and banerjee 2015 the rotating zone of the computational domain is provided an angular rotational speed of rotor sliding mesh method has been considered to resemble the rotating behavior of the turbine rotor convergence criteria for all residuals of momentum continuity and turbulence equations is defined as 1 10 5 for each time step 4 4 grid independence test in order to perform spatial grid independence test a number of simulations have been carried out with different refinement level of mesh which covers a wide range of mesh elements of 12 4 20 1 million the level of refinement has extended up to that grid independent limit gil after which quantitative change in results becomes insignificant table 3 gives various level of refinement of the mesh adopted for grid independence test on the basis of earlier study sarma et al 2014 pressure coefficient at mid point of turbine blade is considered as decisive parameter for which gil is determined pressure coefficient has been obtained for each refinement level adopted at the mid height of the rotor and at the mid chord of the blade fig 8 shows the variation of the pressure coefficient with different refinement levels adopted under grid independence test as a result the refinement level 5 with 14 8 million numbers of elements is found as grid independent limit for mesh count under spatial test this level of refinement for mesh has been considered for the simulation after performing grid independence test after spatial convergence of grid temporal test for time step convergence for transient simulations is an important step in order to maintain accuracy therefore to obtain the time step independent results the discretization of time step is performed on the spatially converged mesh and the results are assessed in terms of power coefficient the simulations were performed on a single stage savonius rotor under a constant flow velocity and tsr values of 0 5 m s and 0 8 respectively time step size represents increment angle for each step rotation the range of time step size is considered as 3 24 with increment rotation angle of 3 the error was computed between two consecutive time step sizes based on the this calculation it was observed that at larger time step size the deviations in the results is maximum which is caused due to ineffectively capturing of rotor characteristics for time step size corresponding to 15 rotation angle the power coefficient is not found to be varying significantly therefore the time step size corresponding to 15 rotation angle is chosen for minimal deviation in results fig 9 and with the least computational cost further the time step corresponding to the least rotation angle increases the computational time with insignificant improvement in the results thus a total of 24 time step sizes are simulated for a complete revolution of the turbine 5 complete rotations of turbine are simulated with 120 time steps it is observed that for the last revolution of turbine asymptomatic value of average torque is obtained 5 results and discussion in ansys cfd post all the simulations cases have been processed to obtain results under the present study total seventy two simulations have been performed for the entire range of parameters considered such as number of stages reynolds number and tsr in order to visualize flow patterns around turbine xy planes are drawn at cross section however velocity and pressure contours around the turbine are described corresponding to maximum value of power coefficient at time point t of 0 583 s corresponds to rotor angular position of 180 half revolution it is notable here that turbine takes 1 166 s to complete one revolution at water velocity of 0 5 m s and tsr of 0 9 5 1 flow field distribution as discussed earlier this study is aimed to understand the flow distribution velocity and pressure contours around the turbine in open channel velocity contours have been obtained from simulations results for all the stages under the flow velocity ranging from 0 5 m s 2 0 m s fig 10 shows the velocity contours for all the stages at flow velocity of 0 5 m s it is observed from fig 10 that velocity at inlet of channel is in same order as per the inlet boundary condition due to turbine rotation and thrust produced by advancing blade maximum velocity is observed at the tip of the blade advancing of upper stage at the moment water flow approaches towards the blades of the rotor flow velocity decreases at trailing edge of blade and wake zone low velocity is formed on the downstream side of the channel the reduction in flow velocity is caused by kinetic energy extraction by rotor blades however the reduction in flow velocity starts recuperating gradually at upper and lower side of wake zone which can be termed as periodic high speed zone further due to continuous bed slope flow regains its original velocity by gravity flow in the downstream of wake zone an attempt has also been made to compare the velocity contours across the rotor with the velocity contours obtained by zhang et al 2017 as shown in fig 11 based on the observation from fig 11 and present velocity contours it is concluded that velocity contours follows the similar trends maximum velocity is found near the edge of advancing blade further wake zone low velocity zone is also found in the downstream side of the channel in order to predict the pressure variations within the flow domain pressure contours are obtained for all the stages under the flow velocity ranging from 0 5 m s to 2 0 m s fig 12 shows the distribution of pressure at tsr corresponding to the maximum power coefficient it is seen from fig 12 that due to inlet kinetic energy maximum pressure is obtained in the upstream side near blade surface while at the downstream side low pressure zone is observed due to swirling flow and low kinetic energy density due to pressure difference across the turbine blades net force drag is developed which causes the rotation of turbine blades further wake zone is also found in the flow domain behind rotating savonius rotor because of flow separation and re circulating flow the pressure contours obtained under present study is compared with the pressure contours obtained by roy and saha 2013 as shown in fig 13 a good agreement in results for patterns of pressure distribution is found with the results reported in earlier study roy and saha 2013 under the present study velocity and pressure distribution have also been obtained for the flow velocity values of 1 0 m s 1 5 m s and 2 m s a similar pattern having different magnitude of velocity and pressure have been found for all the contours however these contours are not shown in the present paper in order to avoid the repetition 5 2 performance characteristics 5 2 1 validation of numerical results in the present study an attempt has been made to validate the numerical results obtained at 0 5 m s for single stage modified sht with the experiment results as shown in fig 14 sarma et al 2014 talukdar et al 2018 it is observed that results of the present study follow the similar trends further the difference in the results are due to variation in the operating conditions during experiments and due to computational constraints assumed during numerical simulations 5 2 2 effect of number of stages on power coefficient cp the numerical simulations are carried out on a savonius hydrokinetic turbine having twist angle of 12 5 blade arc angle of 150 and blade shape factor of 0 6 with varying number of stages st number of stages st studied are single double and three stage table 4 gives the values of power coefficient obtained numerically through simulations for one double and three stage of turbine under different values of reynolds number considered based on numerical results performance characteristics cp λ curves are drawn for different stages and reynolds number as shown in fig 15 it can be noted that the maximum value of power coefficient is found at a tsr value of 0 9 the increment in tsr value results in increase in turbine rpm therefore with further increase in tsr beyond 0 9 the effect of backward drag produced by returning side blade retard the turbine motion and hence reduction in the development of net torque and power coefficient in order to analyze the effect of number of stages on the performance of savonius hydrokinetic turbine the variation of maximum power coefficient with number of stages under different values of flow velocity is also shown in fig 16 it is clearly seen that magnitude of power coefficient increases with increase in number of stages attaining the maximum value for double stage sht and then decreases with further increase in number of stages for double stage savonius rotor the maximum power coefficient is observed due to reduction in torque fluctuations the reduction in torque fluctuation increased the net torque generation and alteration in system structure reduced the rotor inertia which may slightly increase the initial starting torque requirement for a double stage sht the maximum power coefficient has been found as 0 40 0 41 0 43 and 0 44 correspond to reynolds number re of 9 38 104 18 76 104 28 15 104 and 37 53 104 respectively 5 2 3 effect of number of stages on static torque coefficient ctst the three rotor models having variable stages are investigated corresponding to the 12 5 twist angle blade 150 arc angle and blade shape factor of 0 6 to observe the effect of rotor staging in terms of static torque coefficient ctst in order to analyze the performance static torque coefficient of rotor is computed at each azimuth position using the torque statistics during turbine rotation the plot of static torque coefficient versus azimuth angle is shown in fig 17 and it can be observed that on increasing the rotor stages the frequency of the maximum and minimum torque generation is decreasing on the other hand the increment in number of stage leads to reduction in the peak of the torque and hence more smooth torque on the turbine shaft the reduction in peak torque is caused due to phase shifting of rotor blades and increase in the interaction frequency of water with rotor blades for a complete revolution of the turbine rotor the maximum average torque is found corresponding to the two stage turbine rotor 5 2 4 effect of reynolds number savonius hydrokinetic turbine is subjected to varying water velocity when placed in a river or open channel hence it is important to investigate the effect of reynolds number on turbine performance over a wide range of flow velocities therefore the effect of reynolds number is discussed for savonius hydrokinetic turbine fig 18 shows the variation of maximum power coefficient with different values of reynolds number for number of stages considered power coefficient has been found to increase monotonically with increase in reynolds number for number of stages considered maximum and minimum values of power coefficient have been observed at reynolds number of 37 53 104 and 9 38 104 respectively at higher values of reynolds number the boundary layer separation got delayed which results in decrease of drag force on returning blade this may increase the moment on the rotor and hence improve the power coefficient this trend of power coefficient with reynolds number has been found on similar lines reported under earlier studies kolekar and banerjee 2015 yang and shu 2012 5 2 5 development of correlation for power coefficient it has been found that the values of power coefficient is strong function of number of stages and operating parameter i e tip speed ratio tsr and reynolds number under the present study tsr is varied on the basis of angular velocity for a given value of reynolds number and rotor diameter the functional relationship for power coefficient in term of these parameters can therefore be stated as 1 cp f λ st re under earlier studies of hydro turbines padhy and saini 2011 gohil and saini 2015 authors have found the feasibility of statistical approach for the development of the correlation from result data obtained it is therefore similar approach has been considered to develop the correlations in this paper the procedure adopted for developing the correlation is detailed in the appendix a it has been found that regression of data deals with the first order and second order the value of the constant and exponents for re st and tsr are found as 0 154 0 063 0 247 and 0 202 respectively the generalized form of the correlation for power coefficient is obtained on the basis of regression analysis and expressed as 2 c p 0 154 re 0 063 s t 0 247 λ 0 202 e 0 196 ln s t 2 e 1 726 ln λ 2 above given eq 2 is the correlation developed for a range of parameters taken under the present study fig 19 shows the comparison of the numerical data of power coefficient and those obtained from the above correlation the red dots represent the data points between power coefficients obtained numerically and power coefficient predicted by equation the black line shows best fit line while green lines represent the prediction band it has been found that around all of the data are observed to lie within 10 the maximum and minimum percentage deviations of the cp predicted by the equation with the value of cp obtained numerically have been found as 20 18 and 2 27 respectively the regression coefficient value for this correlation is 0 95 and average absolute percentage deviation is 11 73 therefore it can be concluded that above power coefficient correlation is reasonably satisfactory for the prediction of the power coefficient for savonius hydrokinetic turbine with reasonable accuracy 6 conclusion the effect of number of stages on the performance of the modified savonius hydrokinetic turbine having twisted blades has been investigated using cfd simulations under different values of reynolds number ranging from 9 38 104 to 37 53 104 based on numerical analysis flow distribution across the turbine vicinity has been analyzed and discussed in the present paper the flow distributions obtained through simulation results has also been validated based on the simulation results maximum value of power coefficient has been found as 0 44 corresponding to tsr value of 0 9 and reynolds number of 37 53 104 for double stage modified savonius hydrokinetic turbine the power coefficient is found to be increased with reynolds number an attempt has been made to develop the correlation for power coefficient as a function of number of stages reynolds number and tsr these computational results can provide information of velocity flow field and pressure variation across the turbine blade which is responsible for rotation of savonius hydrokinetic turbine further the developed correlation may be useful for the turbine designers or researchers to predict the performance of savonius hydrokinetic turbine for the considered range of parameters credit authorship

competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a procedure to develop correlation for power coefficient based on the numerical study carried out under the present paper it has been found that power coefficient of savonius hydrokinetic turbine was affected by tip speed ratio tsr reynolds number and number of stage due to complex geometry of turbine rotor no analytical relationship for power coefficient is possible hence empirical correlation of power coefficient as a function of tip speed ratio reynolds number and number of stage is required to be developed from the results data obtained for a given range of parameters it has been found that the regression of data deals with first order and second order polynomials the procedure adopted for developing the correlation is detailed to understand the general form of first order and second order equation in following sections 1 1 first order equation the relationship is said to be linear when one variable y is equal to other x multiplied by a constant m first order equation for a linear relationship or for a straight line has simple variable with highest power of 1 and can be written as a1 y m x c where m is the slope of line and c is the intercept of the line on ordinate by transforming the x and y data into log form eq a 1 can be written as a2 ln y m ln x c 1 or a3 ln y ln x m ln a n t i ln c 1 or a4 ln y ln x m a n t i ln c 1 by taking anti log on both sides the above equation can be written as a5 y antiln c 1 x m which is the general form of first order equation the values of c1 and m can be obtained from the first order regression of the data on plot of ln x and ln y the first order equation can be obtained by putting the values of c1 and m in the eq a 5 1 2 second order equation in second order the highest power of the independent variable is 2 in general it can be written as a 6 y c 0 c 1 x c 2 x 2 by transforming the x and y data into log form eq a 6 can be written as a 7 ln y c 0 c 1 ln x c 2 ln x 2 following the method discussed in section a 1 the above equation can be written as a 8 y a n t i ln c 0 x c 1 exp c 2 ln x 2 the values of c0 c1 and c2 can be obtained from the second order regression of the data on the plot of ln x and ln y therefore the second order equation can be obtained by putting the values of c0 c1 and c2 in the eq a 8 1 3 development of correlation in order to determine the functional relationship between power coefficient and tsr a second order polynomial as given in eq a 8 has been employed for fixed values of all the system parameters average value of equation coefficients i e c0 c1 and c2 is found as 0 94 0 20 and 1 73 through regression analysis a plot of ln c p as a function of ln λ has been shown in fig a 1 which resulted in following relationship a 9 c p a 0 λ 0 202 e 1 726 ln λ 2 coefficient a0 is equal to antilog c0 as given in above mentioned eq a 8 the parameter a0 is also function of others parameters like number of stage st and reynolds number re therefore in order to induce the effect of number of stage st a functional relationship between coefficient of power cp and number of stage st has been established by plotting values of ln a 0 against different values of tsr and fixed values of other parameters a plot of ln a 0 and ln s t as shown in fig a 2 resulted in second order expression as given in eq a 10 a10 a 0 b 0 s t 0 247 e 0 196 ln s t 2 replacing the value of a0 using eq a 9 and after rearranging the relationship of power coefficient cp with tsr λ and number of stage st is written as a11 c p b 0 s t 0 247 λ 0 202 e 0 196 ln s t 2 e 1 726 ln λ 2 fig a1 plot of ln c p as a function of ln λ fig a1 fig a2 plot of ln a 0 as a function of ln s t fig a2 similarly in order to induce the effect of reynolds number in the correlation the relationship between ln b 0 versus ln re can be described by using following first order equation as shown in fig a3 a12 b 0 d 0 re 0 063 where d0 antiln 1 871 0 154 using value of b0 and d0 in eq a 11 and after rearranging the equation following expression between power coefficient cp and tsr λ number of stage st and reynolds number re is obtained a13 c p 0 154 re 0 063 s t 0 247 λ 0 202 e 0 196 ln s t 2 e 1 726 ln λ 2 fig a3 plot of ln b 0 as a function of ln re fig a3 finally eq a 13 represents the correlation for power coefficient as a function of system and operating parameters this eq a 13 is similar to eq 2 of the

maulana azad national institute of technology bhopal india corresponding author savonius hydrokinetic turbine is considered as an environmentally friendly and cost effective turbine to extract hydrokinetic potential available in flowing streams however this turbine has not been fully explored as the solution for the main problem of low efficiency of savonius turbine is still being investigated around the globe in order to study the effect of number of stages this study aims to analyze the performance of modified savonius hydrokinetic turbine having twisted blade under different

its high energy concentration and predictability considering the large energy potential of naturally occurring high energy flows viz river stream canal flow and the limited availability of non renewable energy resources hydrokinetic energy could play a pertinent role tampier et al 2017 development of hydrokinetic technology can be described in four phases traditional empirical establishment growth and modern periods van els and brasil 2015 the hydrokinetic technology is capable to meet wide range of energy demands viz instrumentation 101 w to small communities 104 w to regional utilities 108 w forbush et al 2016 although innovative techniques to extract hydrokinetic energy are also being investigated hydrokinetic energy converters can be broadly categorized as turbine type system rotational motion and non turbine type viz oscillatory motion laws and epps 2016 furthermore axial flow horizontal axis turbine and cross flow systems vertical axis turbine are considered as two distinct classes of turbine type systems based on rotor axis alignment with water flow kumar and saini 2016 lee et al 2019 the horizontal axis turbines are predominantly used in tidal energy or marine current energy extraction due to their higher efficiency but these turbines are expensive for small scale energy conversion due to their certain advantages viz design simplicity independency of flow direction and ease of installation the vertical axis turbine is generally preferred over the horizontal axis turbine for small scale power generation saini and saini 2018 moreover these turbines need relatively lesser maintenance as various electrical components can be installed above the free surface of the water khan et al 2009 stated that vertical axis turbines can be installed either as a single unit in small rivers or stacked together in large rivers these certain advantages of vertical axis turbine have encouraged intensive research for the design and development of improved turbine saini and saini 2020a in recent years a number of techniques such as cyclic blade system hwang et al 2009 central deflector amelio et al 2012 flapping blades yang and lawn 2011 yang and lawn 2013 wu et al 2020 flexible foils gundersen 2015 hybrid rotor saini and saini 2020b and variable pitch blade jing et al 2014 have been adopted to improve the efficiency of vertical axis turbine for river tidal and ocean applications one of the most prominent rotor configurations of hydrokinetic turbines is savonius rotor turbine which was design and developed by finish engineer s j savonius in 1920 for wind energy applications fernandes and rostami 2015 it is a drag based energy conversion device which has good starting characteristics at low speed saini and saini 2019 savonius hydrokinetic turbines shts face the problem of poor performance and it is difficult to integrate with a generator because of its low operating speed however it has several advantages such as rotation is independent of fluid flow direction simple to design and manufacture cost effective and less vibration load on the supporting structure unlike the wind flow water flows in a well defined direction this eliminates the need of yaw control mechanism and reduces complexity this improves reliability and reduces maintenance considering the aforementioned advantages savonius hydrokinetic turbine is suitable for the following application small scale standalone hydraulic turbine that can be used to generate electrical power for household applications and for operating water pumps charging batteries powering telecommunications and several other low power applications patel et al 2017 in the recent years a number of studies have been carried out to improve the performance of savonius rotor as wind and water turbine flow field generated by hydrokinetic and wind turbine is quite different because water flow is governed by gravity while wind flow is governed by pressure difference the contours of free surface flow may be changed due to presence of turbine in channel subsequently performance of turbine is affected hence there is need to investigate the effect of different parameters on the performance of savonius rotor working as water turbine kumar and saini 2016 reviewed and presented the parameters which influence of the performance of savonius type hydrokinetic turbine furthermore a number of studies were reported to evaluate the performance of savonius rotor as hydrokinetic turbine as given in table 1 kamoji et al 2008 also carried out experimental investigation to study the effect of number of stages on the performance of savonius wind turbine kamoji et al 2009 also proposed and investigated the modified shape of blade for semicircular profile of single savonius wind turbine golecha et al 2011 carried out experimental investigation on single double and three stage of savonius hydrokinetic turbine having modified shape of blade proposed by kamoji et al 2009 2 objective of the present study the aforementioned investigations highlight that effect of number of stages with twisted blade profile is still not explored for modified savonius hydrokinetic turbine hence there is a need to study the effect of number of stages on the performance of modified savonius hydrokinetic turbine with twisted blades in an open channel flow based on gap identified in earlier studies the objectives of present research are given below i to study the effect of a number of stages on the performance of the modified savonius hydrokinetic turbine having twisted blades for different values of reynolds number ii to develop a correlation for power coefficient in terms of tsr number of stages and reynolds number using commercial available software fluent unsteady and rotating 3d cfd simulations are carried out in present study to evaluate the effect of number of stages for hydrokinetic turbine 3 selection of design parameters of savonius turbine and open channel under the present study the performance parameters considered are number of stages st and reynolds number the conventional savonius turbine with geometrical changes in the blade shape has been referred to as modified savonius turbine the blades shape of the conventional savonius rotor is altered by taking blade arc angle ψ and blade shape factor p q kumar and saini 2017b the blade arc angle refers the reduction in curvature profile of blade which assist in the reduction of backward drag force the blade shape factor is the measure of the reduction of inner curvature near rotor shaft which results in reduction of energy losses during rotation on the other hand the twist angle refers the angle throughout the length height of the blade instead of straight line the twist angle provides the uniform gliding of water over the blade profile which results in reduction of torque fluctuations fig 1 a shows the top view of modified blade shape while fig 1 b graphical representation of twisted blade profile front view schematic of single stage double stage and three stage turbine are also illustrated in fig 1 c fig 1 d and fig 1 e respectively two blade savonius rotor having zero overlap ratio and aspect ratio h d of 1 51 is considered for the numerical investigations based on earlier studies kumar and saini 2017a 2017b turbine having twist angle α of 12 5 blade arc angle ψ of

end plates kamoji et al 2009 for numerical investigations the turbine is considered to be submerged completely in the open channel the open channel having rectangular cross section of 0 55 m 0 65 m for a length of 3 0 m is considered under the present study the turbine is placed at distance of 1 5 m from the inlet of open channel effect of boundary proximity i e distance between turbine and around walls on the performance of turbine has not been considered under the present study therefore turbine position inside the channel at equal distance from the walls and channel blockage ratio of 11 8 has been kept constant the range of reynolds number is considered as 9 38 104 to 37 52 104 which corresponds to 0 5 m s to 2 m s range of tsr has been considered as 0 5 1 0 for a typical value of rotor diameter and flow velocity or reynolds number 4 numerical investigation 4 1 3d modelling of computational domain a 3d model of multi stage savonius hydrokinetic turbine is created using ansys design modeler as per aforementioned parameters three dimensional model of turbine for one two and three stage are shown in fig 2 a computational domain which represents open channel is also modeled for cfd study this domain is divided into sub domains i e stationary zone and rotating zone to generate the rotating zone cylindrical volume enclosing turbine is created about z axis the circumference of the cylindrical volume is set as an interface to make sure the continuity of the flow field fig 3 shows the complete computational domain where z axis is rotation axis of the turbine 4 2 mesh generation the mesh generation of computational domain is crucial step which is generated in ansys mesh using non conformal unstructured grid of tetrahedral elements fig 4 shows the discretization of the rotating zones for single double and three stage in order to effectively capture the flow field and boundary layer formations mesh is refined at the blade surface by providing the inflations layers as shown in fig 5 under earlier studies zhou and rempfer 2013 tian et al 2016 to apply the realizable k ε turbulence model y value less than one was recommended to fix the height of first cell thickness above the blade surface accordingly the value of y has been considered as less than one under the present investigation various mesh quality parameters viz aspect ratio 16 skewness 0 22 and orthogonal quality 0 21 were monitored and are found to be in good agreement 4 3 turbulence model and boundary conditions computational mesh is imported to ansys fluent v 15 0 to solve unsteady incompressible navier stokes equations in order to resemble the turbine rotation under actual operating conditions transient unsteady numerical simulations have been performed and appropriate turbulence model along with necessary boundary conditions are employed the published experimental results for a classical savonius turbine has been compared with results of employed turbulence models to study the effect of turbulence model as shown in fig 6 hayashi et al 2005 the good agreement has been found between results of cfd and experiments for power coefficient when using the realizable k ε turbulence model as shown in fig 6 therefore the realizable k ε model has been considered under present numerical simulations the selection of boundary conditions is shown in fig 7 under the present study it is assumed that turbine operates with complete submerged conditions in order to reduce the surface effect therefore top of the domain is assigned with symmetry condition sarma et al 2014 the extreme right boundary in y direction has been set as outflow condition for channel outlet sarma et al 2014 kolekar and banerjee 2015 the rotating zone of the computational domain is provided an angular rotational speed of rotor sliding mesh method has been considered to resemble the rotating behavior of the turbine rotor convergence criteria for all residuals of momentum continuity and turbulence equations is defined as 1 10 5 for each time step 4 4 grid independence test in order to perform spatial grid independence test a number of simulations have been carried out with different refinement level of mesh which covers a wide range of mesh elements of 12 4 20 1 million the level of refinement has extended up to that grid independent limit gil after which quantitative change in results becomes insignificant table 3 gives various level of refinement of the mesh adopted for grid independence test on the basis of earlier study sarma et al 2014 pressure coefficient at mid point of turbine blade is considered as decisive parameter for which gil is determined pressure coefficient has been obtained for each refinement level adopted at the mid height of the rotor and at the mid chord of the blade fig 8 shows the variation of the pressure coefficient with different refinement levels adopted under grid independence test as a result the refinement level 5 with 14 8 million numbers of elements is found as grid independent limit for mesh count under spatial test this level of refinement for mesh has been considered for the simulation after performing grid independence test after spatial convergence of grid temporal test for time step convergence for transient simulations is an important step in order to maintain accuracy therefore to obtain the time step independent results the discretization of time step is performed on the spatially converged mesh and the results are assessed in terms of power coefficient the simulations were performed on a single stage savonius rotor under a constant flow velocity and tsr values of 0 5 m s and 0 8 respectively time step size represents increment angle for each step rotation the range of time step size is considered as 3 24 with increment rotation angle of 3 the error was computed between two consecutive time step sizes based on the this calculation it was observed that at larger time step size the deviations in the results is maximum which is caused due to ineffectively capturing of rotor characteristics for time step size corresponding to 15 rotation angle the power coefficient is not found to be varying significantly therefore the time step size corresponding to 15 rotation angle is chosen for minimal deviation in results fig 9 and with the least computational cost further the time step corresponding to the least rotation angle increases the computational time with insignificant improvement in the results thus a total of 24 time step sizes are simulated for a complete revolution of the turbine 5 complete rotations of turbine are simulated with 120 time steps it is observed that for the last revolution of turbine asymptomatic value of average torque is obtained 5 results and discussion in ansys cfd post all the simulations cases have been processed to obtain results under the present study total seventy two simulations have been performed for the entire range of parameters considered such as number of stages reynolds number and tsr in order to visualize flow patterns around turbine xy planes are drawn at cross section however velocity and pressure contours around the turbine are described corresponding to maximum value of power coefficient at time point t of 0 583 s corresponds to rotor angular position of 180 half revolution it is notable here that turbine takes 1 166 s to complete one revolution at water velocity of 0 5 m s and tsr of 0 9 5 1 flow field distribution as discussed earlier this study is aimed to understand the flow distribution velocity and pressure contours around the turbine in open channel velocity contours have been obtained from simulations results for all the stages under the flow velocity ranging from 0 5 m s 2 0 m s fig 10 shows the velocity contours for all the stages at flow velocity of 0 5 m s it is observed from fig 10 that velocity at inlet of channel is in same order as per the inlet boundary condition due to turbine rotation and thrust produced by advancing blade maximum velocity is observed at the tip of the blade advancing of upper stage at the moment water flow approaches towards the blades of the rotor flow velocity decreases at trailing edge of blade and wake zone low velocity is formed on the downstream side of the channel the reduction in flow velocity is caused by kinetic energy extraction by rotor blades however the reduction in flow velocity starts recuperating gradually at upper and lower side of wake zone which can be termed as periodic high speed zone further due to continuous bed slope flow regains its original velocity by gravity flow in the downstream of wake zone an attempt has also been made to compare the velocity contours across the rotor with the velocity contours obtained by zhang et al 2017 as shown in fig 11 based on the observation from fig 11 and present velocity contours it is concluded that velocity contours follows the similar trends maximum velocity is found near the edge of advancing blade further wake zone low velocity zone is also found in the downstream side of the channel in order to predict the pressure variations within the flow domain pressure contours are obtained for all the stages under the flow velocity ranging from 0 5 m s to 2 0 m s fig 12 shows the distribution of pressure at tsr corresponding to the maximum power coefficient it is seen from fig 12 that due to inlet kinetic energy maximum pressure is obtained in the upstream side near blade surface while at the downstream side low pressure zone is observed due to swirling flow and low kinetic energy density due to pressure difference across the turbine blades net force drag is developed which causes the rotation of turbine blades further wake zone is also found in the flow domain behind rotating savonius rotor because of flow separation and re circulating flow the pressure contours obtained under present study is compared with the pressure contours obtained by roy and saha 2013 as shown in fig 13 a good agreement in results for patterns of pressure distribution is found with the results reported in earlier study roy and saha 2013 under the present study velocity and pressure distribution have also been obtained for the flow velocity values of 1 0 m s 1 5 m s and 2 m s a similar pattern having different magnitude of velocity and pressure have been found for all the contours however these contours are not shown in the present paper in order to avoid the repetition 5 2 performance characteristics 5 2 1 validation of numerical results in the present study an attempt has been made to validate the numerical results obtained at 0 5 m s for single stage modified sht with the experiment results as shown in fig 14 sarma et al 2014 talukdar et al 2018 it is observed that results of the present study follow the similar trends further the difference in the results are due to variation in the operating conditions during experiments and due to computational constraints assumed during numerical simulations 5 2 2 effect of number of stages on power coefficient cp the numerical simulations are carried out on a savonius hydrokinetic turbine having twist angle of 12 5 blade arc angle of 150 and blade shape factor of 0 6 with varying number of stages st number of stages st studied are single double and three stage table 4 gives the values of power coefficient obtained numerically through simulations for one double and three stage of turbine under different values of reynolds number considered based on numerical results performance characteristics cp λ curves are drawn for different stages and reynolds number as shown in fig 15 it can be noted that the maximum value of power coefficient is found at a tsr value of 0 9 the increment in tsr value results in increase in turbine rpm therefore with further increase in tsr beyond 0 9 the effect of backward drag produced by returning side blade retard the turbine motion and hence reduction in the development of net torque and power coefficient in order to analyze the effect of number of stages on the performance of savonius hydrokinetic turbine the variation of maximum power coefficient with number of stages under different values of flow velocity is also shown in fig 16 it is clearly seen that magnitude of power coefficient increases with increase in number of stages attaining the maximum value for double stage sht and then decreases with further increase in number of stages for double stage savonius rotor the maximum power coefficient is observed due to reduction in torque fluctuations the reduction in torque fluctuation increased the net torque generation and alteration in system structure reduced the rotor inertia which may slightly increase the initial starting torque requirement for a double stage sht the maximum power coefficient has been found as 0 40 0 41 0 43 and 0 44 correspond to reynolds number re of 9 38 104 18 76 104 28 15 104 and 37 53 104 respectively 5 2 3 effect of number of stages on static torque coefficient ctst the three rotor models having variable stages are investigated corresponding to the 12 5 twist angle blade 150 arc angle and blade shape factor of 0 6 to observe the effect of rotor staging in terms of static torque coefficient ctst in order to analyze the performance static torque coefficient of rotor is computed at each azimuth position using the torque statistics during turbine rotation the plot of static torque coefficient versus azimuth angle is shown in fig 17 and it can be observed that on increasing the rotor stages the frequency of the maximum and minimum torque generation is decreasing on the other hand the increment in number of stage leads to reduction in the peak of the torque and hence more smooth torque on the turbine shaft the reduction in peak torque is caused due to phase shifting of rotor blades and increase in the interaction frequency of water with rotor blades for a complete revolution of the turbine rotor the maximum average torque is found corresponding to the two stage turbine rotor 5 2 4 effect of reynolds number savonius hydrokinetic turbine is subjected to varying water velocity when placed in a river or open channel hence it is important to investigate the effect of reynolds number on turbine performance over a wide range of flow velocities therefore the effect of reynolds number is discussed for savonius hydrokinetic turbine fig 18 shows the variation of maximum power coefficient with different values of reynolds number for number of stages considered power coefficient has been found to increase monotonically with increase in reynolds number for number of stages considered maximum and minimum values of power coefficient have been observed at reynolds number of 37 53 104 and 9 38 104 respectively at higher values of reynolds number the boundary layer separation got delayed which results in decrease of drag force on returning blade this may increase the moment on the rotor and hence improve the power coefficient this trend of power coefficient with reynolds number has been found on similar lines reported under earlier studies kolekar and banerjee 2015 yang and shu 2012 5 2 5 development of correlation for power coefficient it has been found that the values of power coefficient is strong function of number of stages and operating parameter i e tip speed ratio tsr and reynolds number under the present study tsr is varied on the basis of angular velocity for a given value of reynolds number and rotor diameter the functional relationship for power coefficient in term of these parameters can therefore be stated as 1 cp f λ st re under earlier studies of hydro turbines padhy and saini 2011 gohil and saini 2015 authors have found the feasibility of statistical approach for the development of the correlation from result data obtained it is therefore similar approach has been considered to develop the correlations in this paper the procedure adopted for developing the correlation is detailed in the appendix a it has been found that regression of data deals with the first order and second order the value of the constant and exponents for re st and tsr are found as 0 154 0 063 0 247 and 0 202 respectively the generalized form of the correlation for power coefficient is obtained on the basis of regression analysis and expressed as 2 c p 0 154 re 0 063 s t 0 247 λ 0 202 e 0 196 ln s t 2 e 1 726 ln λ 2 above given eq 2 is the correlation developed for a range of parameters taken under the present study fig 19 shows the comparison of the numerical data of power coefficient and those obtained from the above correlation the red dots represent the data points between power coefficients obtained numerically and power coefficient predicted by equation the black line shows best fit line while green lines represent the prediction band it has been found that around all of the data are observed to lie within 10 the maximum and minimum percentage deviations of the cp predicted by the equation with the value of cp obtained numerically have been found as 20 18 and 2 27 respectively the regression coefficient value for this correlation is 0 95 and average absolute percentage deviation is 11 73 therefore it can be concluded that above power coefficient correlation is reasonably satisfactory for the prediction of the power coefficient for savonius hydrokinetic turbine with reasonable accuracy 6 conclusion the effect of number of stages on the performance of the modified savonius hydrokinetic turbine having twisted blades has been investigated using cfd simulations under different values of reynolds number ranging from 9 38 104 to 37 53 104 based on numerical analysis flow distribution across the turbine vicinity has been analyzed and discussed in the present paper the flow distributions obtained through simulation results has also been validated based on the simulation results maximum value of power coefficient has been found as 0 44 corresponding to tsr value of 0 9 and reynolds number of 37 53 104 for double stage modified savonius hydrokinetic turbine the power coefficient is found to be increased with reynolds number an attempt has been made to develop the correlation for power coefficient as a function of number of stages reynolds number and tsr these computational results can provide information of velocity flow field and pressure variation across the turbine blade which is responsible for rotation of savonius hydrokinetic turbine further the developed correlation may be useful for the turbine designers or researchers to predict the performance of savonius hydrokinetic turbine for the considered range of parameters credit authorship

competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper appendix a procedure to develop correlation for power coefficient based on the numerical study carried out under the present paper it has been found that power coefficient of savonius hydrokinetic turbine was affected by tip speed ratio tsr reynolds number and number of stage due to complex geometry of turbine rotor no analytical relationship for power coefficient is possible hence empirical correlation of power coefficient as a function of tip speed ratio reynolds number and number of stage is required to be developed from the results data obtained for a given range of parameters it has been found that the regression of data deals with first order and second order polynomials the procedure adopted for developing the correlation is detailed to understand the general form of first order and second order equation in following sections 1 1 first order equation the relationship is said to be linear when one variable y is equal to other x multiplied by a constant m first order equation for a linear relationship or for a straight line has simple variable with highest power of 1 and can be written as a1 y m x c where m is the slope of line and c is the intercept of the line on ordinate by transforming the x and y data into log form eq a 1 can be written as a2 ln y m ln x c 1 or a3 ln y ln x m ln a n t i ln c 1 or a4 ln y ln x m a n t i ln c 1 by taking anti log on both sides the above equation can be written as a5 y antiln c 1 x m which is the general form of first order equation the values of c1 and m can be obtained from the first order regression of the data on plot of ln x and ln y the first order equation can be obtained by putting the values of c1 and m in the eq a 5 1 2 second order equation in second order the highest power of the independent variable is 2 in general it can be written as a 6 y c 0 c 1 x c 2 x 2 by transforming the x and y data into log form eq a 6 can be written as a 7 ln y c 0 c 1 ln x c 2 ln x 2 following the method discussed in section a 1 the above equation can be written as a 8 y a n t i ln c 0 x c 1 exp c 2 ln x 2 the values of c0 c1 and c2 can be obtained from the second order regression of the data on the plot of ln x and ln y therefore the second order equation can be obtained by putting the values of c0 c1 and c2 in the eq a 8 1 3 development of correlation in order to determine the functional relationship between power coefficient and tsr a second order polynomial as given in eq a 8 has been employed for fixed values of all the system parameters average value of equation coefficients i e c0 c1 and c2 is found as 0 94 0 20 and 1 73 through regression analysis a plot of ln c p as a function of ln λ has been shown in fig a 1 which resulted in following relationship a 9 c p a 0 λ 0 202 e 1 726 ln λ 2 coefficient a0 is equal to antilog c0 as given in above mentioned eq a 8 the parameter a0 is also function of others parameters like number of stage st and reynolds number re therefore in order to induce the effect of number of stage st a functional relationship between coefficient of power cp and number of stage st has been established by plotting values of ln a 0 against different values of tsr and fixed values of other parameters a plot of ln a 0 and ln s t as shown in fig a 2 resulted in second order expression as given in eq a 10 a10 a 0 b 0 s t 0 247 e 0 196 ln s t 2 replacing the value of a0 using eq a 9 and after rearranging the relationship of power coefficient cp with tsr λ and number of stage st is written as a11 c p b 0 s t 0 247 λ 0 202 e 0 196 ln s t 2 e 1 726 ln λ 2 fig a1 plot of ln c p as a function of ln λ fig a1 fig a2 plot of ln a 0 as a function of ln s t fig a2 similarly in order to induce the effect of reynolds number in the correlation the relationship between ln b 0 versus ln re can be described by using following first order equation as shown in fig a3 a12 b 0 d 0 re 0 063 where d0 antiln 1 871 0 154 using value of b0 and d0 in eq a 11 and after rearranging the equation following expression between power coefficient cp and tsr λ number of stage st and reynolds number re is obtained a13 c p 0 154 re 0 063 s t 0 247 λ 0 202 e 0 196 ln s t 2 e 1 726 ln λ 2 fig a3 plot of ln b 0 as a function of ln re fig a3 finally eq a 13 represents the correlation for power coefficient as a function of system and operating parameters this eq a 13 is similar to eq 2 of the

21462,the present article deals with the coupling of hydrodynamic loading modelled by openfoam finite volume fv framework for computational fluid dynamics cfd and the structural response modelled by the general 3d finite element fe approach the overall methodology and the numerical approaches which are discussed are very general and remain valid for any type of hydro structure interaction problems but here the main concern is on marine structures ships off shore platforms where the loading is induced by water waves in the present work the accent is placed on the linear quasi static structural response which is the problem belonging to the one way coupling procedures particularly this means that the hydrodynamic and structural simulations can be performed independently of each other the main technical issue becomes the consistent transfer of the hydrodynamic loads from the hydrodynamic cfd mesh to the structural fe mesh this paper presents a novel methodology of the load transfer based on the projection method for the specific application to fv hydrodynamic and fe structural coupling validation tests are performed on a simple fixed vertical cylinder in presence of waves and on a more practical case of container ship in large waves demonstrating the robustness and accuracy of the method keywords cfd fem fluid structure interaction nastran openfoam nomenclature l

pressure p d dynamic pressure w element deflection vector 1 introduction striving for continuous improvement and weight reduction in marine structures impacts the design philosophy from the initial stage conservative classification rules based on the experience are often regarded as too rigorous with respect to the real sea loadings exerted on the structures in order to reduce the potentially over dimensioned structural elements while preserving the structural integrity modern computational tools are increasingly developed for a more realistic sea load calculations the first step in the general hydro structure interaction calculations is the interpolation between partially overlapping meshes of fluid and structure in recent works frequently used interpolation method for the field transfer on partially overlapping meshes is the radial basis function rbf interpolation due to its robustness see dou et al 2019 thomas et al 2019 however the drawback of the rbf is in the reconstruction of the interpolation matrix at every change of field values and to increase the accuracy of the method a global interpolation is often performed all this requires at every time step to construct and solve a full matrix which can hold huge computational expense in the entire simulation more efficient alternative to the rbf is the projection method ji et al 2014 proposed a projection of the entire panel to the fluid mesh in case the structural element projects to multiple fluid elements for each part of the structural element different pressure is assigned the method results with a difference in the total force and moment on the fluid mesh which are then artificially removed by an optimizing algorithm another type of projection is shown by piro and maki 2013 here the projection is based from structural integration points per finite element i e gauss points the pressure value is obtained by averaging the values in four closest fluid face centres although robust and stable the averaging of the pressure obviously diffuses the pressure peaks especially present in slamming effects hence lowering the structural response approach featuring structural integration points is also presented by paik et al 2009 and farhat et al 1998 where the accent is placed upon the two way interaction on the other hand interesting approach is presented by martínez ferrer et al 2018 where the entire interaction is solved inside the finite volume fv framework thus contributing significantly to the efficiency of the method in parallel from a practical point of view recently there is a significant rise in the application of hydro structural tools most often solvers employed in the interaction are the finite element method fem for the structural part and the cfd for the fluid solution paik and carrica 2014 employed cfd fem coupling and studied the rolling tank motions including the free surface effects where a good agreement is found with the experimental data in order to reduce the vortex vibrations matin nikoo et al 2018 successfully optimized the design using the cfd fem interface pernod et al 2019 performed the experimental analysis of the composite hydrofoil and validated the experimental data with the cfd fem numerical method also investigating the hydrofoil vibrations huang et al 2019 found similar wet frequencies compared to experimental data other applications of hydro structure coupling can also be found when investigating sloshing effects hwang et al 2016 as well as in offshore structures lim and xiao 2016 obvious need for a more accurate structural response with respect to fluid loadings has also influenced a number of industrial software available see cole and neu 2019 dhavalikar et al 2015 majority of the above references and some additional recent works see el el moctar et al 2017 takami et al 2018 feature a two way coupling procedure with the significance of the work based around the preservation of motions and forces on the interface which mutually interact in some practical cases there is no need for the elastic motions to be taken into account and the only major problem becomes how to transfer correctly the fluid surface forces to the structural nodes pressure transfer and grid interpolation is frequently referred as a small part of the entire procedure and is not studied in detail due to complexities involved in the communication between the meshes additionally in a two way coupling physical problems are rather different comparing to the quasi static approach such as the geometrical change of the mesh topology and the influence of structural deformation on the flow field for the stated reason methods employed in a two way approach can often be too robust when used in a quasi static manner the present paper deals with the one way coupling methods within the linear quasi static assumptions for the structural response i e constant structural stiffness matrix in this sense the main technical issue is related to the consistent pressure transfer from the hydrodynamic mesh to the structural mesh as a loading of the fe structural model in the present work the fluid solution is based on the fv arbitrary polyhedra framework of openfoam in the community driven branch foam extend coupling with the fem solver is performed using the method which could be classified as the projection method the nodal forces are computed from the fluid pressure field on the projection of the structural integration points gauss points for this particular work it is assumed that the interface structural elements are linear plate elements which are almost exclusively found in the offshore and shipping industry and include finite elements in contact with water full theoretical and practical details are given regarding the calculation of nodal forces and the comparison is made with the simpler uniform pressure transfer per element it is important to stress that the use of different elements would be fairly easy to add since the interaction tool is developed in the objected oriented environment using c furthermore the procedure to calculate the pressure at the structural points projected on the fluid mesh is thoroughly described with the highlighted benefits of the rigid body assumption in the quasi static approach pressure is taken without decreasing the possible peak of the loading at a certain fluid cell by careful geometrical consideration regarding the differing mesh densities i e if the structural model contains few elements at the location of the strong pressure gradients the number of gaussian points per element can simply be increased thus capturing the non uniformity of the pressure field more accurately the paper is divided into four main sections second section describes separately the mathematical background of the hydrodynamic and the structural solver with the full implementation details of the coupling interface third section features two test cases force and moment transfer for the fixed cylinder in waves and container ship encountering green water phenomena for which structural analysis of the breakwater structure is performed finally in the fourth section conclusions are drawn 2 hydro structure interaction model for the sake of clarity the theoretical background of the hydrodynamic and the structural numerical models is presented 2 1 hydrodynamic model hydrodynamic model is based on the fully non linear cfd solver using the open source code openfoam in the fv discretisation the two phase model for naval applications is solved using a dedicated navalhydro pack the governing equations for the incompressible flow are continuity equation 1 u 0 momentum equation 2 u t uu ν u 1 ρ x p d r where p d is the dynamic pressure x is the spatial vector g is gravitational acceleration ρ x is the density dependent on the fluid properties r is the reynolds stress tensor and ν is the kinematic viscosity as can be seen in equation 2 surface tension effects are neglected since they are assumed to be small for the naval hydrodynamic applications the two phase flow formulation is handled with the most conservative indicator function α or the so called volume of fluid approach ubbink and issa 1999 3 α t u α u r α 1 α 0 where the third term is called the compressive term active only in the vicinity of the free surface i e when α is between 0 and 1 well known problem of the free surface smearing due to the non physical density interpolation is handled with the ghost fluid method gfm theoretical details are provided in huang et al 2007 with the detailed implementation of the vof and gfm coupled with the incompressible flow given in vukčević et al 2017 it is important to note that with the gfm the smearing does not influence the density field additionally the tangential stress balance is approximated with the continuous effective viscosity field defined in the following equation 4 ν e α ν e w 1 α ν e a where ν e a and ν e w are effective kinematic viscosities for air and water respectively in case of fixed cylinder simulations different method is applied to the two phase flow formulation since there is no separation of the free surface instead of the vof method the level set ls formulation is applied sun and beckermann 2007 with the phase field pf defined as the signed distance function which is the shortest euclidean distance from the free surface 5 φ ψ tanh ψ ε 2 where ψ is the signed distance field and ε is the interface smearing parameter details of the implementation are provided in vukčević et al 2016a and vukčević et al 2016b with the detailed verification and validation of the method the waves are defined using a fully non linear stream function wave theory to eliminate the wave reflection from the boundaries relaxation zones are placed at the edges of the boundaries following jasak et al 2015 2 2 structural model without loss of generality a general quadrilateral plate finite element is considered as shown in fig 1 description of the element in parametric space eases the evaluation of the different integrals when using the gauss quadrature integration method parametric space can be obtained by mapping the initial physical space using the following shape mapping functions 6 n i 1 4 1 ξ i ξ 1 η i η where ξ i and η i are the coordinates of the four nodes in the parametric space with these notations the local coordinates and local space derivatives can be evaluated using the following expressions 7 x l i 1 4 n i ξ η x i l y l i 1 4 n i ξ η y i l 8 x l ξ i 1 4 n i ξ η ξ x i l y l ξ i 1 4 n i ξ η ξ y i l 9 x l η i 1 4 n i ξ η η x i l y l η i 1 4 n i ξ η η y i l where x i l and y i l are the nodal coordinates in the local coordinate system specific to each finite element furthermore the local deformation of the typical plate element is defined by local deflection w l and two local rotation vectors β x l and β y l 10 β x l w l x l β y l w l y l it follows that there exist three degrees of freedom per node and the vector of the nodal unknowns in the local coordinate system become 11 δ l t w 1 l β x 1 l β y 1 l w 4 l β x 4 l β y 4 l where the notation t is used to denote the transpose operation with these notations the local plate deflection w l inside the finite element can be formally written in the following form 12 w l x l ξ η y l ξ η w l ξ η i 1 n n i w ξ η δ i l n w t δ l the vector n w in the above equation is composed of the interpolation functions which are in principle independent of the previously defined shape functions n i there are many different ways to chose the interpolation functions and usually the polynomial representation is chosen it is common to write 13 n w t n 11 w n 12 w n 13 w n 41 w n 42 w n 43 w the well known case of the simple iso parametric elements is recovered by writing 14 n i 1 w n i n i 2 w n i 3 w 0 the simple iso parametric finite elements are known not to be very precise and usually more sophisticated elements are used typical example are the cquad elements in nastran siemens 2014 or the dkq elements in open source software code aster edf 2020 the quality and efficiency of the different formulations depends on the choice of those functions details of different formulations will not be mentioned here it is only noted that the representation equation 13 remains formally valid for all of them although this section contains the details regarding the quadrilateral element the same principles apply to the triangular plate element the main difference is the number of nodes and the number and position of gauss points for the sake of simplicity the detailed expressions are not presented here 2 2 1 generalized nodal forces as already indicated in the introduction only the pressure induced forces are considered here so that the virtual work can be written as 15 w s l p w l d s where p is the external pressure within the parametric representation of the finite element surface equation of the element surface and its differential element can be written as follows 16 r l ξ η x l ξ η i l y l ξ η j l d s r l ξ r l η d ξ d η so that the virtual work can be written as 17 w 1 1 1 1 p w l x l ξ y l η y l ξ x l η d ξ d η this can be written in compact form as 18 w f w l t δ l where 19 f w l t f 11 w l f 12 w l f 13 w l f 41 w l f 42 w l f 43 w l and 20 f i j w l 1 1 1 1 p n i j w x l ξ y l η y l ξ x l η d ξ d η where the interpolation functions n i j w are defined by equation 13 this is the final expression for the nodal force vector in the local coordinate system as can be seen the expression in equation 20 does not include the viscous shear forces the viscous shear force contribution would require the consideration of the virtual work in the plane of the element however these effects are judged to be negligible for current purposes and are neglected the main technical issue in the present work is the calculation of nodal forces shown in equation 20 which are evaluated using the classical gauss quadrature method in order to perform such calculations the pressure needs to be evaluated at the gauss points for all finite elements finally it is important to stress that the number of gauss points does affect the computed nodal forces on each finite element since the computed hydrodynamic pressure obtained from cfd is fully non linear the increase in gauss points provides a more accurate calculation of the nodal force integral from equation 20 of course this is true only for the cases where there is a discontinuous pressure distribution along the finite element for a reasonably smooth pressure field the number of gauss points per element could be even reduced to 1 without any loss in the integral calculation 2 2 2 reference to global coordinate system for the nodal forces evaluated in the local coordinate system certain transformations need to be defined in order to compute the global vector field of nodal forces as known any vector quantity can be expressed in multiple reference frames preserving its magnitude and direction and the same applies to the nodal force vector since the fem final system of equations is written in the global coordinate system certain geometrical transformations are necessary the local coordinate system can be observed in fig 1 and the definition is expressed as 21 i l p 2 p 1 p 2 p 1 j l k l i l k l n r l ξ r l η r l ξ r l η d ξ d η where k l is the vector oriented in the vertical direction from the element and i l is chosen as the tangential vector with the definition of the local coordinate system the orthogonal transformation matrix q can be easily evaluated hence for an arbitrary vector v it can be written 22 v q t v l v l q v it is important to note that the definition of the virtual work is independent of the coordinate system meaning 23 w f w l t δ l f w t δ 2 3 fem cfd interface as already indicated the nodal forces follow from the integrals equation 20 which are evaluated using the gauss quadrature rule which requires the values of the hydrodynamic pressure in each gauss point even if the number of gauss point is very important for the precision of the integration it is somehow irrelevant in the context of the pressure value interpolation indeed whatever the number of gauss points the generic problem reduces to the interpolation of the hydrodynamic pressure from the cfd mesh to one particular gauss point g i which position in space is arbitrary the straightforward method of evaluating the pressure at gauss point would be to simply read the pressure value at the point spatial location from cfd two types of inconsistencies can occur with this approach first the gauss point can be located outside of the cfd domain i e where the pressure is undefined hence making the interpolation invalid second it is possible for the gauss point to be located in the cfd domain but outside of the surface layer cells which would significantly reduce the interpolated pressure value especially when assessing impact loads these two types of inconsistencies are shown in fig 2 the present subsection describes the theory and implementation of the method developed within this work the main difficulty is the preservation of the pressure field smoothness absence of the discontinuous or step wise pressure pattern and the relative balance of total forces on both meshes without any artificial adjustment the method employed in this study is usually addressed as the consistent interpolation based scheme the method features a projection based algorithm for the transfer of the field between two non matching 2d surfaces in 3d space algorithms employed are similar to gluing method projection of structural integration points described by maman and farhat 1995 and farhat et al 1998 with certain important differences in further abbreviation structural integration point will be addressed as g i with its corresponding point on the fluid mesh noted as g i h 2 3 1 processing of cfd interface mesh from the cfd point of view in the fv framework during the calculation of the fluid solution only the face and cell centres of the cfd surface mesh are used in the linear system of equations while solving the discretised form of equation 1 and equation 2 fig 3 shows the spatial points involved in the discretisation on the boundary surface since only the flux between the internal faces is solved in a non linear loop achieving conservative fluid solution the key step is how to connect the step wise profile of the fluid boundary face centre values to a continuous pressure field to be more clear on the subject the interpolation problem is additionally visualised in fig 4 along a simplified 1d cfd surface where the pressure value is sought for the green point p 1 value is obtained with no interpolation on the interface surface while p 2 assumes linear variation between control volumes complexity is highly increased for a 3d cfd domain and 2d interface surface but the problem remains similar strictly speaking any interpolation extrapolation of the pressure from those discrete values to other points in the domain represents an additional approximation however there are different more or less efficient ways to perform the interpolation the quality of this interpolation can be critical for the cases where the gradient of the pressure is important and where the size of the hydrodynamic and the structural meshes is comparable in practice these situations occur regularly especially in the cases of the hydrodynamic impact where depending on the local flow conditions the gradient of the pressure can be huge in order to reduce the influence of these abrupt changes of the pressure on the structural response the interpolation procedure should be performed very carefully and the smooth distribution needs to be targeted without the reduction of accuracy the methodology in this study combines two main steps interpolation from face and cell centres to points shape function interpolation inside the fluid boundary face the interpolation is carried out using all the adjacent face centres and cell centres for the selected point the interpolation is performed using the weighted linear least squares fit the details of the least square are given in the appendix a all values contributing to the final value at the point are shown in fig 5 main advantage of this approach lies in its computational efficiency method is purely geometrical meaning that the distance relation between the points governs the interpolation the largest part of the procedure lies in the construction of the geometrical matrix abbreviated as m g for each cfd interface mesh point in these circumstances if usual mesh morphing algorithms are considered for instance the closest point morphing or overset the geometrical relation near the moving body usually does not change during the entire run time in the fluid solution hence leaving the geometrical matrix equal for each point this advantage is unable to achieve using the usual rbf interpolation which requires the construction of the matrix at every change of surrounding field values in any case if the relation between the points has changed i e for a deforming body the geometrical matrix can be simply updated slightly increasing the computational expense however in the scope of quasi static approach the geometrical matrix should remain equal during the entire pressure transfer process at the end of this step using the presented interpolation field values are known both at the nodes and at the centres of the surface elements on the cfd interface mesh due to important practical reasons additionally explained in the following subsection 2 3 2 the fluid mesh is fully triangulated meaning that at the end of the step all the elements of the cfd interface surface contain exactly three nodes one of the key points is how to properly perform the triangulation for the later use of the interpolation functions without loosing any valuable information from the fluid solution the straightforward method would be to completely skip the triangulation and use directly the shape functions inside each cfd surface face with the values at the points obtained by the least square interpolation however this approach would results in a small diffusion of the peak value contained in the face centre since all the adjacent point values contain smaller or equal values in order to keep intact the pressure values at the centres of the faces of cfd interface mesh the triangulation is performed around the face centre to clarify it is necessary to assume a regular triangular face on the fluid surface mesh this triangle is not kept for the triangulation surface but is subdivided into three triangles around its geometrical centre recall that the geometrical centre is equivalent to the face centre which is used in solving of discretised system of equations in cfd with the proposed method the value at any point can be obtained by simply using the interpolation function for each triangle type of the interpolation functions used should be established according to the order of accuracy of the fluid solver for that reason linear approximation of the pressure is selected with this approach the cfd value at the face centre is preserved with the fully defined variation of the pressure field on the entire cfd interface mesh triangulation additionally improves the robustness of the approach without any loss of accuracy in the interpolation process assuming linear field variation inside a cfd control volume visual description of the triangulation process and the pressure calculation is shown in fig 6 furthermore similar to fem for an arbitrary element belonging to the triangulated fluid surface and given the projected point inside the triangle it can be written for the pressure 24 p g i h j 1 3 n j g i h x l y l p j where g i h x y z is expressed in the local coordinate system as g i h x l y l in order to determine the shape function coefficient with respect to the triangulation of the surface each triangle has two pressure values obtained from the least square interpolation to points and one taken exactly as the value at the face centre in the fluid domain the shape function coefficients are defined as 25 n j h 0 5 x j 1 l y j 2 l x j 2 l y j 1 l y j 1 l y j 2 l x l x j 2 l x j 1 l y l a where a is the area of the triangle the superscript h in n j h denotes the hydro shape function coefficients and the subscript j goes from 1 to 3 since all the elements are triangles as can be seen from the above expression the shape function coefficients n j h are only dependant on the spatial location of nodes and the projected point once again the rigid body assumption where the elastic motions are considered negligible in the flow solution quasi static approach can be used to gain advantage obviously for a non deformable body n j coefficients remain equal throughout the cfd simulation and can simply be stored during the pre processing stage of the pressure transfer 2 3 2 processing of fem interface mesh when processing the cfd interface mesh the hydrodynamic pressure is known at the nodes of all the triangles of the cfd interface surface hence it is easily calculated at an arbitrary surface location the distribution of the pressure on each triangle is assumed linear and the same shape functions as those for the finite elements are used in the present case the points where the pressure needs to be interpolated are the projections of the gauss points of the fe mesh this means that the dedicated procedure for projection of an arbitrary point in space gauss point onto an arbitrary surface in space discretised by the triangular elements cfd interface surface should be established due to the continuous rise in the mesh sizes finding the adjacent closest point on a large meshes can be cpu time consuming this is where the fact that only triangular elements are involved plays an important practical role the triangular representation allows the use of highly efficient search algorithms the algorithm used in the current study is based on a tree data structure called the octree the algorithm subdivides the searching bounding box into eight sub boxes octants with the process recursively repeating until the boxes with the potentially closest elements are found at this point the different closest elements can be tested since all of the elements are triangles specialized algorithm for the distance calculation between a point and a triangle in 3d is used to additionally accelerate the mapping procedure method is based on the approach from eberly 1999 method handles both the search when the projection is inside the triangle as well as the marginal case when the projection is on the edge or on the point of the element making the overall procedure very robust different possibilities for the projected gauss point are summarized in fig 7 where three possible cases are identified 2 4 summary coupling procedure after the evaluation of the separate data structures fem and cfd has been defined in subsections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 the outline of the coupling will be given here together with the key aspects of the procedure the above desccribed procedure allows calculating the nodal forces for each fe individually in its local coordinate system in order to build the final system of equations for the whole structure it is necessary to transfer the nodal forces from the local to the global coordinate system this operation is relatively easy and can be done using the explanations in subsection 2 2 2 finally it should also be noted that for moving floating structures additional acceleration loading needs to be added but the description of this part of the loading is trivial and requires the knowledge of the global body accelerations of the center of gravity as previously stated the entire procedure is currently made for the application to the linear quasi static approach bearing this assumption in mind the following procedure can be summarized as follows pre processing stage triangulation of the cfd surface mesh around the face centres projection of the gauss points only for fem elements in contact with water onto the fluid surface mesh 26 g k i g k i h for k 1 2 n s for i 1 2 m k g p where n s is the number of finite elements in the structural model and m k g p is the number of gauss points for k th element construction of the weighted linear least square geometrical matrix m g for each point on the cfd interface mesh calculation of shape function coefficients on the triangulated cfd interface mesh n j h for every g k i h with j 1 2 3 processing stage obtain pressure values for each time step in fluid simulation t 1 t 2 t n calculate interpolated values at cfd surface mesh points 27 m g i b t p i for t t 1 t 2 t n for i 1 2 n h where n h denotes the number of points in the cfd interface mesh and b contains the pressure values at cell centres and face centres at a given time step t the same cell and face centres were used to construct the m g in the pre processing stage compute values at the projected points by using previously stored n j h looping through all elements and gauss projected points as in equation 26 and also for all selected time steps t 28 p g k i h t j 1 3 n j g k i h x l y l p j t using calculated pressure values at gauss points compute the global vector field of nodal forces transformation from local to global system post processing stage loading file for the fem solver nodal forces accelerations etc this procedure is very general and due to the object oriented techniques it is fairly easy to use it within any fem software the interventions are required only in the fem reader and writer libraries leaving the core of the interface intact at the same time it should be noted that the developed tool gives in the comparison of the total forces and moments acting on both meshes which can be used as an initial indicator of how well the pressure transfer was achieved additionally the visualization files of the two interface meshes hydro and structure together with corresponding pressure distributions are produced making the tool easy to use and inspect the possible errors the overall procedure is shown schematically in fig 8 3 results and discussion two test cases are selected to verify and validate the hydro structure interface the main idea is to demonstrate the accuracy of the pressure transfer by measuring the forces and moments on cfd mesh and comparing them to the ones acting on the fem mesh first case features a fixed vertical circular cylinder exposed to the waves of two different wavelengths the second test case concerns more complex wave body interactions of the container ship in large waves the second case is particularly interesting because it leads to the occurrence of the green water phenomena on the ship deck and consequently to large hydrodynamic impact on the structure of the breakwater for this case both global loads on the whole ship as well as the local loads on breakwater are investigated together with the structural response on the breakwater which is studied in detail with respect to the mesh density finally the proposed method is compared against a more simpler method for all cases within this simpler method the pressure value at the structural gauss points is taken to be equal to the pressure at the cell centre where the projection occurred which basically means that the interpolation introduced in section 2 3 1 is not used i e for the green point in fig 4 value p 1 is selected it is important to note that the projection step is also done for this method because if the fem gauss point happens to be located outside of the cfd domain see point b shown in fig 2 the entire transfer would be invalid since the pressure for that specific point remains non existing this method will be abbreviated as simple method while the current method will be abbreviated as new method in the subsequent graphs of the current section 3 1 fixed vertical cylinder in regular waves in the present study the focus is on the accuracy of the load transfer so the flow solution is not examined in detail and the cfd results are assumed to be converged it should be noted that this fact does not influence the conclusions about the quality of the pressure transfer because the origin of the cfd solution is somehow irrelevant in the present context of course in the general application cases the convergence of the cfd solution needs to be studied first circular cylinder of 10m height h and of 2m diameter d is fixed to the seabed in the water of 5m depth wave height is chosen as 0 22m while the wave length λ is set to 2 9m equalling λ 1 1 45 d for the first wave and 1 6m or λ 2 0 8 d for the second this leads to the wave steepness of a λ 0 038 and a λ 0 069 respectively cfd domain spans 4 d in front of the cylinder 4 d on the sides with 10 d behind the cylinder to prevent wave reflection computational domain is shown in fig 9 the total number of cells is approximately 10 6 which is deemed enough for the current study in order to ensure the convergence of the flow more than 10 periods are computed with 400 time steps per wave period after convergence is achieved the pressure is stored for the last period with 40 time steps per wave period snapshot of the computations is shown in fig 10 for the first wave with the surface elevation and the dynamic pressure contours on the fixed cylinder at this point cfd calculations are finished and hydro structure interface can be run as already indicated in this particular case no structural calculations are performed the comparison between the forces and moments on fluid and structural meshes is examined only for that purpose three different structural fem meshes are built with 5 404 finite elements for the finest mesh 2 860 for the medium mesh and 825 elements for the coarse mesh on the fluid side the resulting cfd mesh at the hydro structure interface has 18310 faces fluid and structural meshes are shown in fig 11 pressure transfer is performed only for the dynamic pressure in this case the dominant force acting on the cylinder is in the axial direction i e aligned with the wave advancing axis and the relevant moment is around the axis perpendicular to the wave direction in the horizontal plane in the current simulation abbreviation is f x for the force and m y for the moment three different numbers of gauss points per finite element are tested depending on the order of interpolation 1 4 and 9 for quadrilateral or 1 3 and 4 for triangular element and the corresponding approximations are abbreviated with respect to the quadrilateral element as g p 1 for 1 gauss point g p 4 for 4 gauss points and g p 9 for 9 gauss points it is also noted that the g p 1 approximation corresponds to the uniform distribution of the pressure over the element this means that in summary 9 types of different comparisons are possible i e three different meshes combined with three orders of approximation although force and moment signal in time give a visual impression of the load transfer quality for example see fig 12 the difference between the forces is examined more quantitatively with the error defined as the percentage of the force range this is done in fig 13 where the distribution of the error for each of the interpolation order and fem mesh is presented together with the comparison to the simple method it can be seen that for all fem meshes the simplest g p 1 approximation shows the worst performance and contains a relatively large error which for the coarsest mesh even rises to 10 however the computation of the nodal forces using at least g p 4 approximation increases the accuracy drastically particularly for the coarsest fe mesh finally as expected the g p 9 approximation additionally improves the accuracy of the model with the error at maximum about 2 meaning that most of the pressure field has been correctly captured and applied to the structural mesh irrelevant to the fem mesh density the reason is not only because larger number of gauss points is included per finite element in the transfer but also because the nodal forces are calculated using the shape functions relevant to the given element this basically creates a smooth distribution of the pressure field in the background of the computation which corresponds more accurately to the cfd solution obviously a non uniform pressure field per element is mandatory fig 13 also shows the reduction in the calculated error compared to the simple method in all of the orders of interpolation hence justifying the improved pressure value computation by proper interpolation scheme in the case of long wave the average absolute error in the entire wave period for the g p 9 approximation and for all meshes is 0 50 0 25 and 0 21 ranging from coarsest to finest fem by the new method while for the simple method the average error is 0 68 0 63 and 0 58 respectively for the shorter wavelength the force transfer features similar pattern of improvement compared to the simple method with the overall error increased for all cases with respect to the longer wavelength see fig 14 this general increase in the error is attributed to the steeper wave profile thus creating a stronger pressure gradient on the cylinder surface however by observing the results even for the coarsest fem mesh the error is kept below 3 with the g p 9 approximation which is deemed acceptable another important measure of the pressure transfer quality is the bending moment m y acting on the structure the results for the moment on the coarsest mesh are shown in fig 15 it can be seen that the relative error for this particular case is lower than for the force transfer with the maximum error rising to about 0 5 for g p 9 on coarsest mesh again an increase in accuracy is observed when using the direct evaluation of the nodal forces instead of applying the constant pressure g p 1 comparison of the averaged errors for the entire period for both force and moment are given in fig 16 against the simple method and for the g p 9 approximation from the results the advantage of applying the proper pressure interpolation is clearly visible on this simple example of a vertical cylinder in regular waves the advantages of the proper interpolation method as well as the more accurate integration scheme increased number of gauss points have been demonstrated and now in the following section a more complex case of a ship sailing in large waves is presented 3 2 container ship in large waves the model of the container ships which was used in the present calculations is the skybench ultra large container ship gatin et al 2019 ship particulars are given in table 1 and the wave characteristics are chosen to maximize the green water event on the deck which lead to the head wave conditions with the wave of amplitude 10 6 m and the wavelength of 385 0 m ship forward speed is set different from the design speed and equals 5 knots according to the expected operating conditions in severe sea state and classification rules full structural model with the extracted wetted surface and side by side with the cfd mesh is shown in fig 17 highlighting the breakwater structure on the deck 3 2 1 hydrodynamic solution cfd simulation is run with a vof two phase model and in order to ensure the convergence of the global ship motions more than 30 wave periods are simulated after geometrical mapping between the overlapping regions is achieved the pressure can be transferred to the fem model first results are compared for the forces and the moments on the entire ship hull and for one fem hull mesh only time signal and the error are shown in fig 18 the error for the larger number of structural integration points is decreased below 0 5 while the g p 1 with the uniform pressure transfer is again relatively inaccurate as was the case in the fixed cylinder case moving on to the breakwater three different breakwater fem meshes have been created with 340 1027 and 4524 finite elements respectively the corresponding number of the cfd cell faces at the interface is 2663 as expected the present case features a violent fluid impact see in fig 19 the snapshot from the simulation on the deck three consecutive time steps around the moment of water impact are shown in fig 20 for cfd original solution and for the fem coarse mesh only first order of interpolation is shown where the pressure is directly transferred visualization of the higher interpolation orders is not feasible since the pressure is directly transformed into nodal forces which cannot be explicitly compared with the cfd surface pressures similar to the cylinder case the error is estimated for the total force f x on the breakwater and the moment m y around the breakwater base the corresponding time signals are shown in fig 21 from where it is obvious the coarsest mesh is capable of only capturing the main impact contours different quantities are used for the error estimation in this case namely the peak values and the corresponding time integrals over the duration of impact which in some sense represent the average error main results are summarized in fig 22 where the comparisons with the simple method are also included the difference between the new method and the simple method is clearly visible for all the fe meshes and for any number of gauss points g p 1 g p 4 and g p 9 indeed the new method shows monotonic covergence properties leading to the same result whatever the number of the gauss points while the simple method shows somehow random behaviour even if the error is not very large this is due to the large pressure gradients which occur during the hydrodynamic impact which can not be properly captured by the simple method and the jumps in pressure distribution on gauss points are likely to occur this is not the case for the method proposed here where the pressure interpolation method is used in preprocessing stage and the pressure distribution was made continuous prior to pressure transfer in addition the increase in the number of gauss points allows for uniform convergence properties of the calculated integrals equation 20 which are needed for the evaluation of the nodal forces this fact represents the significant advantage of the new method which allows the uniform convergence properties regardless of the possible discontinuities in the cfd results when hydrodynamic impact occurs 3 2 2 structural response structural mesh consists mainly of 2d plate elements mostly quadrilateral breakwater front pane is supported by 2d beam elements and additional vertical plate stiffeners fixed constraints are placed at the structure bottom since it is analysed separately from the full ship model fem solution is calculated with the commercial fem software nx nastran within the framework of femap software hydrodynamic loads are transferred for the same time steps as presented in the previous section 3 2 1 besides the pressure or nodal forces ship accelerations are also imported to the fem solver i e translational and rotational acceleration fem model is kept constant while the global accelerations are rotated to account for the ship motion during transient load in total 41 load cases were considered in order to cover the encounter period the fem model is shown on fig 23 for the finest mesh structural analysis is performed for all three orders of interpolation g p 1 g p 4 and g p 9 and for the new method and simple method on all three breakwater fem meshes differing in grid density the deformation of two fem nodes is analysed in more detail one node is chosen at the middle side of the breakwater where the impact is highest and the other node is selected more to the side of a breakwater top structure these nodes are abbreviated as p m and p s for middle and side node respectively node location and corresponding time signal during the impact is presented in fig 24 detailed comparison is made only for the instant of the pressure peak comparison between all possible cases for the two selected fem nodes is presented in fig 25 from the results it can be seen that the new method shows consistency with relation to the mesh density for the finest mesh the order of interpolation almost does not change the resulting nodal displacement and the improvement is obvious comparing the coarse and medium mesh while the fine mesh can be regarded to as the reference the simple method performs similar as when comparing the force transfer in section 3 2 1 solution does not follow consistent improvement with respect to mesh density or interpolation and also for the finest mesh the oscillation dependant on the order is too high this can be explained by the cfd step wise pressure pattern since the method depends too much on the location of the gauss point projection the new method simply overcomes this issue by performing the smooth pressure distribution along the cfd interface mesh which makes the method far less influenced by the geometrical differences in the fluid and structural interface surfaces and projection errors according to the presented results the pressure interpolation step proves to be important in terms of robustness and consistency of the load mapping method not only for the hydrodynamic pressure transfer but also for the resulting structural response 4 conclusion in this paper an efficient numerical procedure for the load transfer from the cfd hydrodynamic model fv framework and the general fem structural solver is described and validated the method is relevant for any type of the hydro structure calculations where the structural response is assumed not to influence the hydrodynamic solution in that respect the proposed methodology belongs to the class of the one way coupling methods and is applied here to the evaluation of the linear quasi static structural response once the interface meshes are properly identified the proposed approach provides an extremely robust tool able to consistently consider any type of the local load variations which might occur in practice this is achieved by evaluating the nodal forces outside of the fem model using very precise numerical integration procedure this point represents a major difference between the present approach and the more common approaches based on simple pressure transfer using the closest point method furthermore in order not to alter the accuracy of the hydrodynamic solution the original values of the hydrodynamic pressure are kept within the interpolation procedure using the special triangulation scheme by doing this no additional numerical error is introduced and the method becomes very stable showing excellent convergence properties the superiority of the present method when compared to the simple pressure transfer is demonstrated on two practical examples the first example considers the water wave diffraction by the circular vertical cylinder where the hydrodynamic loading is relatively smooth in space and no major issues related to the pressure interpolation occur two waves were selected with the difference in wave length to inspect the influence of the interpolation on a smoother or steeper wave profile satisfactory results are found for both waves with the error in the force transfer decreasing with the larger number of gauss points per element or the number of fem elements when comparing to the simpler method the proposed method performs better in both cylinder wave cases when computing the force transfer error with respect to the hydrodynamic solution the second example is related to the evaluation of the structural response of the breakwater to the non uniform impulsive pressure loading induced by the green water event the proposed approach shows stable and consistent behaviour of the transferred hydrodynamic loads with respect to mesh density and number of gauss points same amount of consistency is observed when assessing the breakwater structural response for the proposed method while the simpler approach shows quite unstable behaviour with the inconsistent convergence properties on both cases even if the work presented here concerns the one way coupling procedure only an important part of this work is applicable to the two way coupling procedures indeed having clearly defined interfaces between the hydro and structural meshes together with the corresponding distribution of the physical quantities e g pressure for cfd and displacements for fem allows for the consistent exchange of any type of information between the two solvers this means in particular that the transfer of the structural deformations from fem to cfd which is necessary in the two way coupling methods can be done using exactly the same procedure as the one which was used here for the pressure transfer however it should be noted that when the dynamic two way coupling simulations are of concern and depending on the coupling procedure it might happen that the cfd interface mesh changes at each time step so that the new coupling needs to be performed at each time step this will of course lead to the increase of the cpu time but the consistency of the approach will be preserved the development of the two way coupling procedure on the basis of the principles presented here are left for further studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

21462,the present article deals with the coupling of hydrodynamic loading modelled by openfoam finite volume fv framework for computational fluid dynamics cfd and the structural response modelled by the general 3d finite element fe approach the overall methodology and the numerical approaches which are discussed are very general and remain valid for any type of hydro structure interaction problems but here the main concern is on marine structures ships off shore platforms where the loading is induced by water waves in the present work the accent is placed on the linear quasi static structural response which is the problem belonging to the one way coupling procedures particularly this means that the hydrodynamic and structural simulations can be performed independently of each other the main technical issue becomes the consistent transfer of the hydrodynamic loads from the hydrodynamic cfd mesh to the structural fe mesh this paper presents a novel methodology of the load transfer based on the projection method for the specific application to fv hydrodynamic and fe structural coupling validation tests are performed on a simple fixed vertical cylinder in presence of

stage conservative classification rules based on the experience are often regarded as too rigorous with respect to the real sea loadings exerted on the structures in order to reduce the potentially over dimensioned structural elements while preserving the structural integrity modern computational tools are increasingly developed for a more realistic sea load calculations the first step in the general hydro structure interaction calculations is the interpolation between partially overlapping meshes of fluid and structure in recent works frequently used interpolation method for the field transfer on partially overlapping meshes is the radial basis function rbf interpolation due to its robustness see dou et al 2019 thomas et al 2019 however the drawback of the rbf is in the reconstruction of the interpolation matrix at every change of field values and to increase the accuracy of the method a global interpolation is often performed all this requires at every time step to construct and solve a full matrix which can hold huge computational expense in the entire simulation more efficient alternative to the rbf is the projection method ji et al 2014 proposed a projection of the entire panel to the fluid mesh in case the structural element projects to multiple fluid elements for each part of the structural element different pressure is assigned the method results with a difference in the total force and moment on the fluid mesh which are then artificially removed by an optimizing algorithm another type of projection is shown by piro and maki 2013 here the projection is based from structural integration points per finite element i e gauss points the pressure value is obtained by averaging the values in four closest fluid face centres although robust and stable the averaging of the pressure obviously diffuses the pressure peaks especially present in slamming effects hence lowering the structural response approach featuring structural integration points is also presented by paik et al 2009 and farhat et al 1998 where the accent is placed upon the two way interaction on the other hand interesting approach is presented by martínez ferrer et al 2018 where the entire interaction is solved inside the finite volume fv framework thus contributing significantly to the efficiency of the method in parallel from a practical point of view recently there is a significant rise in the application of hydro structural tools most often solvers employed in the interaction are the finite element method fem for the structural part and the cfd for the fluid solution paik and carrica 2014 employed cfd fem coupling and studied the rolling tank motions including the free surface effects where a good agreement is found with the experimental data in order to reduce the vortex vibrations matin nikoo et al 2018 successfully optimized the design using the cfd fem interface pernod et al 2019 performed the experimental analysis of the composite hydrofoil and validated the experimental data with the cfd fem numerical method also investigating the hydrofoil vibrations huang et al 2019 found similar wet frequencies compared to experimental data other applications of hydro structure coupling can also be found when investigating sloshing effects hwang et al 2016 as well as in offshore structures lim and xiao 2016 obvious need for a more accurate structural response with respect to fluid loadings has also influenced a number of industrial software available see cole and neu 2019 dhavalikar et al 2015 majority of the above references and some additional recent works see el el moctar et al 2017 takami et al 2018 feature a two way coupling procedure with the significance of the work based around the preservation of motions and forces on the interface which mutually interact in some practical cases there is no need for the elastic motions to be taken into account and the only major problem becomes how to transfer correctly the fluid surface forces to the structural nodes pressure transfer and grid interpolation is frequently referred as a small part of the entire procedure and is not studied in detail due to complexities involved in the communication between the meshes additionally in a two way coupling physical problems are rather different comparing to the quasi static approach such as the geometrical change of the mesh topology and the influence of structural deformation on the flow field for the stated reason methods employed in a two way approach can often be too robust when used in a quasi static manner the present paper deals with the one way coupling methods within the linear quasi static assumptions for the structural response i e constant structural stiffness matrix in this sense the main technical issue is related to the consistent pressure transfer from the hydrodynamic mesh to the structural mesh as a loading of the fe structural model in the present work the fluid solution is based on the fv arbitrary polyhedra framework of openfoam in the community driven branch foam extend coupling with the fem solver is performed using the method which could be classified as the projection method the nodal forces are computed from the fluid pressure field on the projection of the structural integration points gauss points for this particular work it is assumed that the interface structural elements are linear plate elements which are almost exclusively found in the offshore and shipping industry and include finite elements in contact with water full theoretical and practical details are given regarding the calculation of nodal forces and the comparison is made with the simpler uniform pressure transfer per element it is important to stress that the use of different elements would be fairly easy to add since the interaction tool is developed in the objected oriented environment using c furthermore the procedure to calculate the pressure at the structural points projected on the fluid mesh is thoroughly described with the highlighted benefits of the rigid body assumption in the quasi static approach pressure is taken without decreasing the possible peak of the loading at a certain fluid cell by careful geometrical consideration regarding the differing mesh densities i e if the structural model contains few elements at the location of the strong pressure gradients the number of gaussian points per element can simply be increased thus capturing the non uniformity of the pressure field more accurately the paper is divided into four main sections second section describes separately the mathematical background of the hydrodynamic and the structural solver with the full implementation details of the coupling interface third section features two test cases force and moment transfer for the fixed cylinder in waves and container ship encountering green water phenomena for which structural analysis of the breakwater structure is performed finally in the fourth section conclusions are drawn 2 hydro structure interaction model for the sake of clarity the theoretical background of the hydrodynamic and the structural numerical models is presented 2 1 hydrodynamic model hydrodynamic model is based on the fully non linear cfd solver using the open source code openfoam in the fv discretisation the two phase model for naval applications is solved using a dedicated navalhydro pack the governing equations for the incompressible flow are continuity equation 1 u 0 momentum equation 2 u t uu ν u 1 ρ x p d r where p d is the dynamic pressure x is the spatial vector g is gravitational acceleration ρ x is the density dependent on the fluid properties r is the reynolds stress tensor and ν is the kinematic viscosity as can be seen in equation 2 surface tension effects are neglected since they are assumed to be small for the naval hydrodynamic applications the two phase flow formulation is handled with the most conservative indicator function α or the so called volume of fluid approach ubbink and issa 1999 3 α t u α u r α 1 α 0 where the third term is called the compressive term active only in the vicinity of the free surface i e when α is between 0 and 1 well known problem of the free surface smearing due to the non physical density interpolation is handled with the ghost fluid method gfm theoretical details are provided in huang et al 2007 with the detailed implementation of the vof and gfm coupled with the incompressible flow given in vukčević et al 2017 it is important to note that with the gfm the smearing does not influence the density field additionally the tangential stress balance is approximated with the continuous effective viscosity field defined in the following equation 4 ν e α ν e w 1 α ν e a where ν e a and ν e w are effective kinematic viscosities for air and water respectively in case of fixed cylinder simulations different method is applied to the two phase flow formulation since there is no separation of the free surface instead of the vof method the level set ls formulation is applied sun and beckermann 2007 with the phase field pf defined as the signed distance function which is the shortest euclidean distance from the free surface 5 φ ψ tanh ψ ε 2 where ψ is the signed distance field and ε is the interface smearing parameter details of the implementation are provided in vukčević et al 2016a and vukčević et al 2016b with the detailed verification and validation of the method the waves are defined using a fully non linear stream function wave theory to eliminate the wave reflection from the boundaries relaxation zones are placed at the edges of the boundaries following jasak et al 2015 2 2 structural model without loss of generality a general quadrilateral plate finite element is considered as shown in fig 1 description of the element in parametric space eases the evaluation of the different integrals when using the gauss quadrature integration method parametric space can be obtained by mapping the initial physical space using the following shape mapping functions 6 n i 1 4 1 ξ i ξ 1 η i η where ξ i and η i are the coordinates of the four nodes in the parametric space with these notations the local coordinates and local space derivatives can be evaluated using the following expressions 7 x l i 1 4 n i ξ η x i l y l i 1 4 n i ξ η y i l 8 x l ξ i 1 4 n i ξ η ξ x i l y l ξ i 1 4 n i ξ η ξ y i l 9 x l η i 1 4 n i ξ η η x i l y l η i 1 4 n i ξ η η y i l where x i l and y i l are the nodal coordinates in the local coordinate system specific to each finite element furthermore the local deformation of the typical plate element is defined by local deflection w l and two local rotation vectors β x l and β y l 10 β x l w l x l β y l w l y l it follows that there exist three degrees of freedom per node and the vector of the nodal unknowns in the local coordinate system become 11 δ l t w 1 l β x 1 l β y 1 l w 4 l β x 4 l β y 4 l where the notation t is used to denote the transpose operation with these notations the local plate deflection w l inside the finite element can be formally written in the following form 12 w l x l ξ η y l ξ η w l ξ η i 1 n n i w ξ η δ i l n w t δ l the vector n w in the above equation is composed of the interpolation functions which are in principle independent of the previously defined shape functions n i there are many different ways to chose the interpolation functions and usually the polynomial representation is chosen it is common to write 13 n w t n 11 w n 12 w n 13 w n 41 w n 42 w n 43 w the well known case of the simple iso parametric elements is recovered by writing 14 n i 1 w n i n i 2 w n i 3 w 0 the simple iso parametric finite elements are known not to be very precise and usually more sophisticated elements are used typical example are the cquad elements in nastran siemens 2014 or the dkq elements in open source software code aster edf 2020 the quality and efficiency of the different formulations depends on the choice of those functions details of different formulations will not be mentioned here it is only noted that the representation equation 13 remains formally valid for all of them although this section contains the details regarding the quadrilateral element the same principles apply to the triangular plate element the main difference is the number of nodes and the number and position of gauss points for the sake of simplicity the detailed expressions are not presented here 2 2 1 generalized nodal forces as already indicated in the introduction only the pressure induced forces are considered here so that the virtual work can be written as 15 w s l p w l d s where p is the external pressure within the parametric representation of the finite element surface equation of the element surface and its differential element can be written as follows 16 r l ξ η x l ξ η i l y l ξ η j l d s r l ξ r l η d ξ d η so that the virtual work can be written as 17 w 1 1 1 1 p w l x l ξ y l η y l ξ x l η d ξ d η this can be written in compact form as 18 w f w l t δ l where 19 f w l t f 11 w l f 12 w l f 13 w l f 41 w l f 42 w l f 43 w l and 20 f i j w l 1 1 1 1 p n i j w x l ξ y l η y l ξ x l η d ξ d η where the interpolation functions n i j w are defined by equation 13 this is the final expression for the nodal force vector in the local coordinate system as can be seen the expression in equation 20 does not include the viscous shear forces the viscous shear force contribution would require the consideration of the virtual work in the plane of the element however these effects are judged to be negligible for current purposes and are neglected the main technical issue in the present work is the calculation of nodal forces shown in equation 20 which are evaluated using the classical gauss quadrature method in order to perform such calculations the pressure needs to be evaluated at the gauss points for all finite elements finally it is important to stress that the number of gauss points does affect the computed nodal forces on each finite element since the computed hydrodynamic pressure obtained from cfd is fully non linear the increase in gauss points provides a more accurate calculation of the nodal force integral from equation 20 of course this is true only for the cases where there is a discontinuous pressure distribution along the finite element for a reasonably smooth pressure field the number of gauss points per element could be even reduced to 1 without any loss in the integral calculation 2 2 2 reference to global coordinate system for the nodal forces evaluated in the local coordinate system certain transformations need to be defined in order to compute the global vector field of nodal forces as known any vector quantity can be expressed in multiple reference frames preserving its magnitude and direction and the same applies to the nodal force vector since the fem final system of equations is written in the global coordinate system certain geometrical transformations are necessary the local coordinate system can be observed in fig 1 and the definition is expressed as 21 i l p 2 p 1 p 2 p 1 j l k l i l k l n r l ξ r l η r l ξ r l η d ξ d η where k l is the vector oriented in the vertical direction from the element and i l is chosen as the tangential vector with the definition of the local coordinate system the orthogonal transformation matrix q can be easily evaluated hence for an arbitrary vector v it can be written 22 v q t v l v l q v it is important to note that the definition of the virtual work is independent of the coordinate system meaning 23 w f w l t δ l f w t δ 2 3 fem cfd interface as already indicated the nodal forces follow from the integrals equation 20 which are evaluated using the gauss quadrature rule which requires the values of the hydrodynamic pressure in each gauss point even if the number of gauss point is very important for the precision of the integration it is somehow irrelevant in the context of the pressure value interpolation indeed whatever the number of gauss points the generic problem reduces to the interpolation of the hydrodynamic pressure from the cfd mesh to one particular gauss point g i which position in space is arbitrary the straightforward method of evaluating the pressure at gauss point would be to simply read the pressure value at the point spatial location from cfd two types of inconsistencies can occur with this approach first the gauss point can be located outside of the cfd domain i e where the pressure is undefined hence making the interpolation invalid second it is possible for the gauss point to be located in the cfd domain but outside of the surface layer cells which would significantly reduce the interpolated pressure value especially when assessing impact loads these two types of inconsistencies are shown in fig 2 the present subsection describes the theory and implementation of the method developed within this work the main difficulty is the preservation of the pressure field smoothness absence of the discontinuous or step wise pressure pattern and the relative balance of total forces on both meshes without any artificial adjustment the method employed in this study is usually addressed as the consistent interpolation based scheme the method features a projection based algorithm for the transfer of the field between two non matching 2d surfaces in 3d space algorithms employed are similar to gluing method projection of structural integration points described by maman and farhat 1995 and farhat et al 1998 with certain important differences in further abbreviation structural integration point will be addressed as g i with its corresponding point on the fluid mesh noted as g i h 2 3 1 processing of cfd interface mesh from the cfd point of view in the fv framework during the calculation of the fluid solution only the face and cell centres of the cfd surface mesh are used in the linear system of equations while solving the discretised form of equation 1 and equation 2 fig 3 shows the spatial points involved in the discretisation on the boundary surface since only the flux between the internal faces is solved in a non linear loop achieving conservative fluid solution the key step is how to connect the step wise profile of the fluid boundary face centre values to a continuous pressure field to be more clear on the subject the interpolation problem is additionally visualised in fig 4 along a simplified 1d cfd surface where the pressure value is sought for the green point p 1 value is obtained with no interpolation on the interface surface while p 2 assumes linear variation between control volumes complexity is highly increased for a 3d cfd domain and 2d interface surface but the problem remains similar strictly speaking any interpolation extrapolation of the pressure from those discrete values to other points in the domain represents an additional approximation however there are different more or less efficient ways to perform the interpolation the quality of this interpolation can be critical for the cases where the gradient of the pressure is important and where the size of the hydrodynamic and the structural meshes is comparable in practice these situations occur regularly especially in the cases of the hydrodynamic impact where depending on the local flow conditions the gradient of the pressure can be huge in order to reduce the influence of these abrupt changes of the pressure on the structural response the interpolation procedure should be performed very carefully and the smooth distribution needs to be targeted without the reduction of accuracy the methodology in this study combines two main steps interpolation from face and cell centres to points shape function interpolation inside the fluid boundary face the interpolation is carried out using all the adjacent face centres and cell centres for the selected point the interpolation is performed using the weighted linear least squares fit the details of the least square are given in the appendix a all values contributing to the final value at the point are shown in fig 5 main advantage of this approach lies in its computational efficiency method is purely geometrical meaning that the distance relation between the points governs the interpolation the largest part of the procedure lies in the construction of the geometrical matrix abbreviated as m g for each cfd interface mesh point in these circumstances if usual mesh morphing algorithms are considered for instance the closest point morphing or overset the geometrical relation near the moving body usually does not change during the entire run time in the fluid solution hence leaving the geometrical matrix equal for each point this advantage is unable to achieve using the usual rbf interpolation which requires the construction of the matrix at every change of surrounding field values in any case if the relation between the points has changed i e for a deforming body the geometrical matrix can be simply updated slightly increasing the computational expense however in the scope of quasi static approach the geometrical matrix should remain equal during the entire pressure transfer process at the end of this step using the presented interpolation field values are known both at the nodes and at the centres of the surface elements on the cfd interface mesh due to important practical reasons additionally explained in the following subsection 2 3 2 the fluid mesh is fully triangulated meaning that at the end of the step all the elements of the cfd interface surface contain exactly three nodes one of the key points is how to properly perform the triangulation for the later use of the interpolation functions without loosing any valuable information from the fluid solution the straightforward method would be to completely skip the triangulation and use directly the shape functions inside each cfd surface face with the values at the points obtained by the least square interpolation however this approach would results in a small diffusion of the peak value contained in the face centre since all the adjacent point values contain smaller or equal values in order to keep intact the pressure values at the centres of the faces of cfd interface mesh the triangulation is performed around the face centre to clarify it is necessary to assume a regular triangular face on the fluid surface mesh this triangle is not kept for the triangulation surface but is subdivided into three triangles around its geometrical centre recall that the geometrical centre is equivalent to the face centre which is used in solving of discretised system of equations in cfd with the proposed method the value at any point can be obtained by simply using the interpolation function for each triangle type of the interpolation functions used should be established according to the order of accuracy of the fluid solver for that reason linear approximation of the pressure is selected with this approach the cfd value at the face centre is preserved with the fully defined variation of the pressure field on the entire cfd interface mesh triangulation additionally improves the robustness of the approach without any loss of accuracy in the interpolation process assuming linear field variation inside a cfd control volume visual description of the triangulation process and the pressure calculation is shown in fig 6 furthermore similar to fem for an arbitrary element belonging to the triangulated fluid surface and given the projected point inside the triangle it can be written for the pressure 24 p g i h j 1 3 n j g i h x l y l p j where g i h x y z is expressed in the local coordinate system as g i h x l y l in order to determine the shape function coefficient with respect to the triangulation of the surface each triangle has two pressure values obtained from the least square interpolation to points and one taken exactly as the value at the face centre in the fluid domain the shape function coefficients are defined as 25 n j h 0 5 x j 1 l y j 2 l x j 2 l y j 1 l y j 1 l y j 2 l x l x j 2 l x j 1 l y l a where a is the area of the triangle the superscript h in n j h denotes the hydro shape function coefficients and the subscript j goes from 1 to 3 since all the elements are triangles as can be seen from the above expression the shape function coefficients n j h are only dependant on the spatial location of nodes and the projected point once again the rigid body assumption where the elastic motions are considered negligible in the flow solution quasi static approach can be used to gain advantage obviously for a non deformable body n j coefficients remain equal throughout the cfd simulation and can simply be stored during the pre processing stage of the pressure transfer 2 3 2 processing of fem interface mesh when processing the cfd interface mesh the hydrodynamic pressure is known at the nodes of all the triangles of the cfd interface surface hence it is easily calculated at an arbitrary surface location the distribution of the pressure on each triangle is assumed linear and the same shape functions as those for the finite elements are used in the present case the points where the pressure needs to be interpolated are the projections of the gauss points of the fe mesh this means that the dedicated procedure for projection of an arbitrary point in space gauss point onto an arbitrary surface in space discretised by the triangular elements cfd interface surface should be established due to the continuous rise in the mesh sizes finding the adjacent closest point on a large meshes can be cpu time consuming this is where the fact that only triangular elements are involved plays an important practical role the triangular representation allows the use of highly efficient search algorithms the algorithm used in the current study is based on a tree data structure called the octree the algorithm subdivides the searching bounding box into eight sub boxes octants with the process recursively repeating until the boxes with the potentially closest elements are found at this point the different closest elements can be tested since all of the elements are triangles specialized algorithm for the distance calculation between a point and a triangle in 3d is used to additionally accelerate the mapping procedure method is based on the approach from eberly 1999 method handles both the search when the projection is inside the triangle as well as the marginal case when the projection is on the edge or on the point of the element making the overall procedure very robust different possibilities for the projected gauss point are summarized in fig 7 where three possible cases are identified 2 4 summary coupling procedure after the evaluation of the separate data structures fem and cfd has been defined in subsections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 the outline of the coupling will be given here together with the key aspects of the procedure the above desccribed procedure allows calculating the nodal forces for each fe individually in its local coordinate system in order to build the final system of equations for the whole structure it is necessary to transfer the nodal forces from the local to the global coordinate system this operation is relatively easy and can be done using the explanations in subsection 2 2 2 finally it should also be noted that for moving floating structures additional acceleration loading needs to be added but the description of this part of the loading is trivial and requires the knowledge of the global body accelerations of the center of gravity as previously stated the entire procedure is currently made for the application to the linear quasi static approach bearing this assumption in mind the following procedure can be summarized as follows pre processing stage triangulation of the cfd surface mesh around the face centres projection of the gauss points only for fem elements in contact with water onto the fluid surface mesh 26 g k i g k i h for k 1 2 n s for i 1 2 m k g p where n s is the number of finite elements in the structural model and m k g p is the number of gauss points for k th element construction of the weighted linear least square geometrical matrix m g for each point on the cfd interface mesh calculation of shape function coefficients on the triangulated cfd interface mesh n j h for every g k i h with j 1 2 3 processing stage obtain pressure values for each time step in fluid simulation t 1 t 2 t n calculate interpolated values at cfd surface mesh points 27 m g i b t p i for t t 1 t 2 t n for i 1 2 n h where n h denotes the number of points in the cfd interface mesh and b contains the pressure values at cell centres and face centres at a given time step t the same cell and face centres were used to construct the m g in the pre processing stage compute values at the projected points by using previously stored n j h looping through all elements and gauss projected points as in equation 26 and also for all selected time steps t 28 p g k i h t j 1 3 n j g k i h x l y l p j t using calculated pressure values at gauss points compute the global vector field of nodal forces transformation from local to global system post processing stage loading file for the fem solver nodal forces accelerations etc this procedure is very general and due to the object oriented techniques it is fairly easy to use it within any fem software the interventions are required only in the fem reader and writer libraries leaving the core of the interface intact at the same time it should be noted that the developed tool gives in the comparison of the total forces and moments acting on both meshes which can be used as an initial indicator of how well the pressure transfer was achieved additionally the visualization files of the two interface meshes hydro and structure together with corresponding pressure distributions are produced making the tool easy to use and inspect the possible errors the overall procedure is shown schematically in fig 8 3 results and discussion two test cases are selected to verify and validate the hydro structure interface the main idea is to demonstrate the accuracy of the pressure transfer by measuring the forces and moments on cfd mesh and comparing them to the ones acting on the fem mesh first case features a fixed vertical circular cylinder exposed to the waves of two different wavelengths the second test case concerns more complex wave body interactions of the container ship in large waves the second case is particularly interesting because it leads to the occurrence of the green water phenomena on the ship deck and consequently to large hydrodynamic impact on the structure of the breakwater for this case both global loads on the whole ship as well as the local loads on breakwater are investigated together with the structural response on the breakwater which is studied in detail with respect to the mesh density finally the proposed method is compared against a more simpler method for all cases within this simpler method the pressure value at the structural gauss points is taken to be equal to the pressure at the cell centre where the projection occurred which basically means that the interpolation introduced in section 2 3 1 is not used i e for the green point in fig 4 value p 1 is selected it is important to note that the projection step is also done for this method because if the fem gauss point happens to be located outside of the cfd domain see point b shown in fig 2 the entire transfer would be invalid since the pressure for that specific point remains non existing this method will be abbreviated as simple method while the current method will be abbreviated as new method in the subsequent graphs of the current section 3 1 fixed vertical cylinder in regular waves in the present study the focus is on the accuracy of the load transfer so the flow solution is not examined in detail and the cfd results are assumed to be converged it should be noted that this fact does not influence the conclusions about the quality of the pressure transfer because the origin of the cfd solution is somehow irrelevant in the present context of course in the general application cases the convergence of the cfd solution needs to be studied first circular cylinder of 10m height h and of 2m diameter d is fixed to the seabed in the water of 5m depth wave height is chosen as 0 22m while the wave length λ is set to 2 9m equalling λ 1 1 45 d for the first wave and 1 6m or λ 2 0 8 d for the second this leads to the wave steepness of a λ 0 038 and a λ 0 069 respectively cfd domain spans 4 d in front of the cylinder 4 d on the sides with 10 d behind the cylinder to prevent wave reflection computational domain is shown in fig 9 the total number of cells is approximately 10 6 which is deemed enough for the current study in order to ensure the convergence of the flow more than 10 periods are computed with 400 time steps per wave period after convergence is achieved the pressure is stored for the last period with 40 time steps per wave period snapshot of the computations is shown in fig 10 for the first wave with the surface elevation and the dynamic pressure contours on the fixed cylinder at this point cfd calculations are finished and hydro structure interface can be run as already indicated in this particular case no structural calculations are performed the comparison between the forces and moments on fluid and structural meshes is examined only for that purpose three different structural fem meshes are built with 5 404 finite elements for the finest mesh 2 860 for the medium mesh and 825 elements for the coarse mesh on the fluid side the resulting cfd mesh at the hydro structure interface has 18310 faces fluid and structural meshes are shown in fig 11 pressure transfer is performed only for the dynamic pressure in this case the dominant force acting on the cylinder is in the axial direction i e aligned with the wave advancing axis and the relevant moment is around the axis perpendicular to the wave direction in the horizontal plane in the current simulation abbreviation is f x for the force and m y for the moment three different numbers of gauss points per finite element are tested depending on the order of interpolation 1 4 and 9 for quadrilateral or 1 3 and 4 for triangular element and the corresponding approximations are abbreviated with respect to the quadrilateral element as g p 1 for 1 gauss point g p 4 for 4 gauss points and g p 9 for 9 gauss points it is also noted that the g p 1 approximation corresponds to the uniform distribution of the pressure over the element this means that in summary 9 types of different comparisons are possible i e three different meshes combined with three orders of approximation although force and moment signal in time give a visual impression of the load transfer quality for example see fig 12 the difference between the forces is examined more quantitatively with the error defined as the percentage of the force range this is done in fig 13 where the distribution of the error for each of the interpolation order and fem mesh is presented together with the comparison to the simple method it can be seen that for all fem meshes the simplest g p 1 approximation shows the worst performance and contains a relatively large error which for the coarsest mesh even rises to 10 however the computation of the nodal forces using at least g p 4 approximation increases the accuracy drastically particularly for the coarsest fe mesh finally as expected the g p 9 approximation additionally improves the accuracy of the model with the error at maximum about 2 meaning that most of the pressure field has been correctly captured and applied to the structural mesh irrelevant to the fem mesh density the reason is not only because larger number of gauss points is included per finite element in the transfer but also because the nodal forces are calculated using the shape functions relevant to the given element this basically creates a smooth distribution of the pressure field in the background of the computation which corresponds more accurately to the cfd solution obviously a non uniform pressure field per element is mandatory fig 13 also shows the reduction in the calculated error compared to the simple method in all of the orders of interpolation hence justifying the improved pressure value computation by proper interpolation scheme in the case of long wave the average absolute error in the entire wave period for the g p 9 approximation and for all meshes is 0 50 0 25 and 0 21 ranging from coarsest to finest fem by the new method while for the simple method the average error is 0 68 0 63 and 0 58 respectively for the shorter wavelength the force transfer features similar pattern of improvement compared to the simple method with the overall error increased for all cases with respect to the longer wavelength see fig 14 this general increase in the error is attributed to the steeper wave profile thus creating a stronger pressure gradient on the cylinder surface however by observing the results even for the coarsest fem mesh the error is kept below 3 with the g p 9 approximation which is deemed acceptable another important measure of the pressure transfer quality is the bending moment m y acting on the structure the results for the moment on the coarsest mesh are shown in fig 15 it can be seen that the relative error for this particular case is lower than for the force transfer with the maximum error rising to about 0 5 for g p 9 on coarsest mesh again an increase in accuracy is observed when using the direct evaluation of the nodal forces instead of applying the constant pressure g p 1 comparison of the averaged errors for the entire period for both force and moment are given in fig 16 against the simple method and for the g p 9 approximation from the results the advantage of applying the proper pressure interpolation is clearly visible on this simple example of a vertical cylinder in regular waves the advantages of the proper interpolation method as well as the more accurate integration scheme increased number of gauss points have been demonstrated and now in the following section a more complex case of a ship sailing in large waves is presented 3 2 container ship in large waves the model of the container ships which was used in the present calculations is the skybench ultra large container ship gatin et al 2019 ship particulars are given in table 1 and the wave characteristics are chosen to maximize the green water event on the deck which lead to the head wave conditions with the wave of amplitude 10 6 m and the wavelength of 385 0 m ship forward speed is set different from the design speed and equals 5 knots according to the expected operating conditions in severe sea state and classification rules full structural model with the extracted wetted surface and side by side with the cfd mesh is shown in fig 17 highlighting the breakwater structure on the deck 3 2 1 hydrodynamic solution cfd simulation is run with a vof two phase model and in order to ensure the convergence of the global ship motions more than 30 wave periods are simulated after geometrical mapping between the overlapping regions is achieved the pressure can be transferred to the fem model first results are compared for the forces and the moments on the entire ship hull and for one fem hull mesh only time signal and the error are shown in fig 18 the error for the larger number of structural integration points is decreased below 0 5 while the g p 1 with the uniform pressure transfer is again relatively inaccurate as was the case in the fixed cylinder case moving on to the breakwater three different breakwater fem meshes have been created with 340 1027 and 4524 finite elements respectively the corresponding number of the cfd cell faces at the interface is 2663 as expected the present case features a violent fluid impact see in fig 19 the snapshot from the simulation on the deck three consecutive time steps around the moment of water impact are shown in fig 20 for cfd original solution and for the fem coarse mesh only first order of interpolation is shown where the pressure is directly transferred visualization of the higher interpolation orders is not feasible since the pressure is directly transformed into nodal forces which cannot be explicitly compared with the cfd surface pressures similar to the cylinder case the error is estimated for the total force f x on the breakwater and the moment m y around the breakwater base the corresponding time signals are shown in fig 21 from where it is obvious the coarsest mesh is capable of only capturing the main impact contours different quantities are used for the error estimation in this case namely the peak values and the corresponding time integrals over the duration of impact which in some sense represent the average error main results are summarized in fig 22 where the comparisons with the simple method are also included the difference between the new method and the simple method is clearly visible for all the fe meshes and for any number of gauss points g p 1 g p 4 and g p 9 indeed the new method shows monotonic covergence properties leading to the same result whatever the number of the gauss points while the simple method shows somehow random behaviour even if the error is not very large this is due to the large pressure gradients which occur during the hydrodynamic impact which can not be properly captured by the simple method and the jumps in pressure distribution on gauss points are likely to occur this is not the case for the method proposed here where the pressure interpolation method is used in preprocessing stage and the pressure distribution was made continuous prior to pressure transfer in addition the increase in the number of gauss points allows for uniform convergence properties of the calculated integrals equation 20 which are needed for the evaluation of the nodal forces this fact represents the significant advantage of the new method which allows the uniform convergence properties regardless of the possible discontinuities in the cfd results when hydrodynamic impact occurs 3 2 2 structural response structural mesh consists mainly of 2d plate elements mostly quadrilateral breakwater front pane is supported by 2d beam elements and additional vertical plate stiffeners fixed constraints are placed at the structure bottom since it is analysed separately from the full ship model fem solution is calculated with the commercial fem software nx nastran within the framework of femap software hydrodynamic loads are transferred for the same time steps as presented in the previous section 3 2 1 besides the pressure or nodal forces ship accelerations are also imported to the fem solver i e translational and rotational acceleration fem model is kept constant while the global accelerations are rotated to account for the ship motion during transient load in total 41 load cases were considered in order to cover the encounter period the fem model is shown on fig 23 for the finest mesh structural analysis is performed for all three orders of interpolation g p 1 g p 4 and g p 9 and for the new method and simple method on all three breakwater fem meshes differing in grid density the deformation of two fem nodes is analysed in more detail one node is chosen at the middle side of the breakwater where the impact is highest and the other node is selected more to the side of a breakwater top structure these nodes are abbreviated as p m and p s for middle and side node respectively node location and corresponding time signal during the impact is presented in fig 24 detailed comparison is made only for the instant of the pressure peak comparison between all possible cases for the two selected fem nodes is presented in fig 25 from the results it can be seen that the new method shows consistency with relation to the mesh density for the finest mesh the order of interpolation almost does not change the resulting nodal displacement and the improvement is obvious comparing the coarse and medium mesh while the fine mesh can be regarded to as the reference the simple method performs similar as when comparing the force transfer in section 3 2 1 solution does not follow consistent improvement with respect to mesh density or interpolation and also for the finest mesh the oscillation dependant on the order is too high this can be explained by the cfd step wise pressure pattern since the method depends too much on the location of the gauss point projection the new method simply overcomes this issue by performing the smooth pressure distribution along the cfd interface mesh which makes the method far less influenced by the geometrical differences in the fluid and structural interface surfaces and projection errors according to the presented results the pressure interpolation step proves to be important in terms of robustness and consistency of the load mapping method not only for the hydrodynamic pressure transfer but also for the resulting structural response 4 conclusion in this paper an efficient numerical procedure for the load transfer from the cfd hydrodynamic model fv framework and the general fem structural solver is described and validated the method is relevant for any type of the hydro structure calculations where the structural response is assumed not to influence the hydrodynamic solution in that respect the proposed methodology belongs to the class of the one way coupling methods and is applied here to the evaluation of the linear quasi static structural response once the interface meshes are properly identified the proposed approach provides an extremely robust tool able to consistently consider any type of the local load variations which might occur in practice this is achieved by evaluating the nodal forces outside of the fem model using very precise numerical integration procedure this point represents a major difference between the present approach and the more common approaches based on simple pressure transfer using the closest point method furthermore in order not to alter the accuracy of the hydrodynamic solution the original values of the hydrodynamic pressure are kept within the interpolation procedure using the special triangulation scheme by doing this no additional numerical error is introduced and the method becomes very stable showing excellent convergence properties the superiority of the present method when compared to the simple pressure transfer is demonstrated on two practical examples the first example considers the water wave diffraction by the circular vertical cylinder where the hydrodynamic loading is relatively smooth in space and no major issues related to the pressure interpolation occur two waves were selected with the difference in wave length to inspect the influence of the interpolation on a smoother or steeper wave profile satisfactory results are found for both waves with the error in the force transfer decreasing with the larger number of gauss points per element or the number of fem elements when comparing to the simpler method the proposed method performs better in both cylinder wave cases when computing the force transfer error with respect to the hydrodynamic solution the second example is related to the evaluation of the structural response of the breakwater to the non uniform impulsive pressure loading induced by the green water event the proposed approach shows stable and consistent behaviour of the transferred hydrodynamic loads with respect to mesh density and number of gauss points same amount of consistency is observed when assessing the breakwater structural response for the proposed method while the simpler approach shows quite unstable behaviour with the inconsistent convergence properties on both cases even if the work presented here concerns the one way coupling procedure only an important part of this work is applicable to the two way coupling procedures indeed having clearly defined interfaces between the hydro and structural meshes together with the corresponding distribution of the physical quantities e g pressure for cfd and displacements for fem allows for the consistent exchange of any type of information between the two solvers this means in particular that the transfer of the structural deformations from fem to cfd which is necessary in the two way coupling methods can be done using exactly the same procedure as the one which was used here for the pressure transfer however it should be noted that when the dynamic two way coupling simulations are of concern and depending on the coupling procedure it might happen that the cfd interface mesh changes at each time step so that the new coupling needs to be performed at each time step this will of course lead to the increase of the cpu time but the consistency of the approach will be preserved the development of the two way coupling procedure on the basis of the principles presented here are left for further studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

21463,breakwater concrete armour units have been continuously evolving since the 1950s lower concrete consumption increased hydraulic stability reduced wave run up and easier placement techniques are the main drivers of this development a recent innovative solution for breakwater armour based on one of the oldest type of units available consists of a configuration adopting a single layer of concrete cubes placed in a regular pattern and a porosity of 0 25 0 30 this paper presents a summary of the laboratory test results available from literature in terms of hydraulic stability and wave overtopping studies indicate that this is a feasible solution with several advantages over other armour configurations related to the simplicity of the cube unit and placement pattern however there is still some degree of uncertainty in both hydraulic stability and wave overtopping estimates for a structure with this configuration where few laboratory tests have been conducted in comparison to other armour units furthermore the available methods for quantification of damage are not considered adequate for use in single layer cube armour with a regular placement pattern this paper discusses current knowledge gaps and provides guidelines for future research graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydraulic stability wave overtopping breakwaters single layer cube regular placement physical modelling 1 introduction a breakwater main function is to protect port s entrances basins and berths to ensure safe navigation and operation in these areas the breakwater armour stone or block weight is a critical parameter in the design of the structure the choice between rock and concrete armour units for the armour layer in a project typically depends on the availability of an adequate rock grading constructability or cost related aspects construction costs depend on numerous factors these being associated to design and logistic factors including the type of armour material unreinforced concrete granite rock sandstone rock etc armour unit mass personnel and material unit costs total concrete consumption placement equipment casting handling and stacking procedures medina et al 2014 during the design process once a unit is selected guidelines for placement hydraulic stability and wave overtopping are available for the various types of concrete units e g ciria 2007 eurotop et al 2007 the empirical formulas in the guidelines are based on laboratory research and experience with prototypes the use of single layer cubes with a regularly placed pattern and low porosity 0 20 0 35 on the seaside of breakwaters is a recent concept and therefore the application of empirical formulas from available guidelines should be viewed with care studies on hydraulic stability and wave overtopping are relatively few compared to other units and only one prototype fig 1 with such configuration has been built to date van der lem et al 2016 this review paper summarizes the state of the art for single layer cube armoured breakwaters identifies gaps in knowledge and presents future research challenges the paper is organized as follows after a brief introduction in section 1 a summary of the use and performance of concrete armour cubes is presented in section 2 section 3 describes the laboratory test results of hydraulic stability and wave overtopping for single layer cube armoured breakwaters knowledge gaps identified in the literature on this breakwater armour configuration are also reported and future research directions provided section 4 presents the main conclusions of this study 2 concrete armour cube structures 2 1 introduction cubes or parallelepipeds are the simplest types of concrete armour unit which have been applied in different configurations table 1 in either physical models or prototypes in regions where rock is not available such as the netherlands cubes or other types of concrete blocks are typically adopted for impermeable patterned block revetments in dike protections klein breteler et al 2014 cubes in patterned block revetments with very low porosity mainly rely on friction between units as a stabilizing force concrete cubes for breakwater armour are traditionally built in a two layer system and with a random placement pattern the cubes of the first layer tend to slide and align with the slope thus creating a less permeable surface which could be subject to excessive pore pressure and subsequent lifting of the blocks muttray and reedjik 2009 the second layer provides additional resilience and aids in increasing permeability which improves hydraulic stability and reduces wave run up when placed randomly the stability of the blocks is obtained primarily through their weight concrete hollow parallelepipeds in a regularly placed pattern have been used on the lee side of breakwaters e g burcharth et al 2015 double layer the stability of a randomly placed double layer of cubes has also been investigated in low crest breakwaters argente et al 2018 table 1 shows different examples of cube armoured breakwater configurations other types of structure configurations common in other units such as coastal revetments berm breakwaters or low crest submerged breakwaters using regularly placed single layer cubes with low porosity 0 3 have still not been thoroughly investigated and applied for example information on single layer cube armoured low crest or submerged breakwaters is limited to few tests e g almeida 2013 unlike other units e g muttray et al 2012 argente et al 2018 where detailed studies have been conducted a regularly placed cube armoured lower slope and berm was adopted in van gent and van der werf 2017 but the focus of the study was to assess the stability of the upper slope built of rock and not the lower slope or the berm 2 2 hydraulic stability detailed research on hydraulic stability of double layer cube armoured breakwaters include cube concrete density triemstra 2000 density of cube placement van den bosch et al 2002 armour porosity and placement methods medina et al 2010 wave obliquity van gent 2003 wolters and van gent 2010 van gent 2014 and roundhead stability vidal et al 1991 maciñeira and burcharth 2007 maciñeira and burcharth 2016 damage in concrete armour layer systems is typically defined by the relative damage number n od proposed by van der meer 1988 as the number of displaced units within a strip of width d n defined as 1 n o d n o b d n where n o represents the number of units displaced out of the armour layer b the width of the tested section and d n the armour unit nominal diameter or equivalent cube length van der meer 1988 developed an empirical formula based on small scale tests with a slope of 1 v 1 5h on a uniform 1 v 30h foreshore slope to estimate the stability number n s in double layer cube armoured breakwaters for a fixed value of related damage number 2 n s h s δ d n 6 7 n o d 0 4 n 0 3 1 0 s o m 0 1 where h s represents the significant wave height δ ρ c ρ w 1 the relative buoyant density with ρ c the rock or concrete density and ρ w the water density n the number of waves and s o m the deepwater wave steepness defined as s o m h m 0 l o m where l o m represents the deepwater wavelength based on the mean wave period t m the use of single layer armour systems has increased since the development of the accropode unit the main advantage of a single layer armour is the concrete volume reduction compared to double layer systems van der meer 1999 found that the start of damage in single layer armour unit systems accropode and core loc occurs at very high stability numbers however the start of damage in single layer armour unit systems is usually followed by a sudden failure and therefore additional safety factors should be applied to provide some margin due to their failure mechanism medina and gomez martin 2012 the initial damage in double layer cube armour structures occurs at lower stability numbers than for single layer structures fig 2 even assuming the definition of failure different for double n od 2 and single layer n od 0 2 as defined in van gent 2003 and van gent and luís 2013 available results show that the failure still occurs at higher stability numbers for single layer structures fig 2 however the damage curves show that for double layer structures it occurs more gradually than for single layers van gent et al 1999 concluded that the performance of single layer cube armour systems is good and that the strength of single top layers seems to be a combination of strength due to weight as for double top layers strength due to contact forces between adjacent blocks as for placed block revetments and less wave attack on single units due to a smoother surface of the entire slope van gent 2003 carried out small scale tests to assess the influence of wave obliquity on the stability of double and single layer cube armoured structures test results show that to reach the same amount of damage e g n od 0 2 a considerable higher wave height is required in the case of cubes in a single layer if the angle of wave attack is 30 or more for cubes in a single layer the wave height compared to perpendicular wave attack needs to be a factor for increased stability number n s of about 2 2 5 higher for an angle of wave attack of 45 whilst for cubes in a double layer this factor is about 1 5 a summary of the stability numbers recommended in ciria 2007 for the design of breakwaters trunk and roundhead sections for cube armour units is presented in table 2 similar stability numbers for single and double layer are proposed for the trunk section which would result in the same unit weight the armour layer stability at breakwaters roundheads is critical with respect to the exposure of the breakwater head muttray and reedijk 2009 this is related to the location of the roundhead usually in deeper water than the trunk and therefore exposed to more energetic wave conditions additionally due to the curvature of the roundhead and subsequent implications such as deviation of unit placement from a regular grid and larger gaps between units reduced stability that the trunk section is typically achieved muttray and reedijk 2009 for double layer cube armour ciria 2007 recommends a lower stability number for the roundhead than for the trunk table 2 to our knowledge investigation on stability of roundheads in single layer cube armoured breakwaters was not published to date and therefore no value is presented in table 2 for other units such as the cubipod sande et al 2018 show that roundheads with double layer armour have stability values similar to that of the single ones under certain conditions 2 3 wave overtopping wave overtopping is a critical aspect of the design and performance of a breakwater several research works in wave overtopping in double layer cube armoured breakwaters have been conducted e g pearson et al 2004 andersen and burcharth 2009 molines et al 2012b mares nassare et al 2019 mean overtopping rates can be estimated with the empirical formula of van der meer and janssen 1994 3 q g h m 0 3 0 2 e x p 2 6 r c h m 0 1 γ f where q represents the mean overtopping discharge h m0 the spectral significant wave height r c the crest freeboard the difference between the still water level and crest elevation and γ f the roughness factor wave overtopping in single layer systems are typically higher due to the lower structure permeability e g molines and medina 2015 for comparison between double and single layer armour of cubipods roughness factors to be applied in eq 3 for different armour layer configurations were estimated in bruce et al 2009 based on small scale model tests double layer systems have lower roughness factors table 3 due to the additional armour layer which provides increased permeability and associated lower wave run up wave overtopping is also expected to be higher in the case of a single layer of cubes than for other one layer systems due to the lower roughness of the cube several studies to assess the influence of wave obliquity on overtopping rates in rubble mound structures have been carried out to date e g galland 1994 andersen and burcharth 2009 nørgaard et al 2013 van gent and van der werf 2019 mares nassare and van gent 2020 andersen and burcharth 2009 show that for rubble mound structures overtopping discharge decreases with increasing wave obliquity and propose reduction factors for short and long crested waves the study also indicates that two layers of randomly placed cubes give just slightly more overtopping than rock armour to the authors knowledge there is no information available on the influence of wave obliquity on overtopping rates for single layer cube armoured structures for comparison against a double layer configuration 3 single layer cube armoured breakwaters 3 1 armour unit placement the placement of single layer interlocking armour units on a breakwater slope has to meet strict requirements for armour unit position and contact points with neighbouring units and slope reedijk et al 2018 a regular placement pattern is understandable simpler and typically preferred in construction sites another advantage of the regular placement is the increased hydraulic stability when compared to randomly placed configurations hald et al 1998 showed that higher stability was achieved when using orderly methods of placement for single layer rock armour units for breakwaters in norway safari et al 2018 compared a regular to random placement of single layer starbloc armour units and found that higher stability numbers are achieved with the regular pattern placement the regular placement of cubes needs to be carefully controlled to achieve the required gap distance between cubes and subsequently the specified porosity the gaps provide a solution for the excess pore pressure gradients when cubes are closely spaced to each other as in very low porosity block revetments in small scale laboratory tests it is feasible to place a single layer of cubes with the required precision however it is uncertain if a specified placing density can be achieved in prototype situations tests have been carried out by verhagen et al 2002 to determine the requirements for dropping concrete blocks from a crane onto a breakwater slope the conclusion is that at a water depth of approximately 10 times the block size this can be achieved and for smaller depths this placing density can be reached without too many difficulties single layer concrete cubes with a regular placement pattern for breakwater armour is a relatively new configuration van gent and luís 2013 concluded that a breakwater with cubes in a single layer is feasible and potentially economically competitive with other single layer units despite having a lower stability number the main advantages of a single layer of cubes compared to other one layer systems are the simplicity of formwork in fabrication high structural strength patent free smaller casting yard area requirements since the removal of the formwork is done vertically safer handling using pressure clamps whilst some other units make use of rope slings efficient area utilization for stacking simple placement grid the lower likelihood of breaking units during construction greater production rate and easier repair works disadvantages are related to the low resilience offered if some blocks are extracted or settlement occurs as in any single layer configuration negligible interlocking between units higher concrete consumption compared to other single layer units and difficulties during construction in the presence of waves due to a strict placement tolerance 3 2 laboratory tests on single layer cube armoured breakwaters 3 2 1 hydraulic stability experimental studies focused on the evaluation of the stability performance of a single layer armour of cubes with low porosity values have been ongoing for the last twenty years several researchers van gent and spaan 1998 d angremond et al 1999 van gent et al 1999 2001 have studied the feasibility of a single layer cube armoured breakwater with porosities between 0 25 and 0 40 with an irregular placement fig 3 left more recent research van buchem 2009 almeida 2013 van gent 2014 van gent and luís 2013 van der lem et al 2016 van gent and van der werf 2017 investigated the combination of a single layer cube armour breakwater with a regular placement fig 3 right van gent et al 1999 carried out small scale physical model tests on a single armour layer of cubes d n 0 036 m cube mass m c 0 110 kg ρ c 2433 kg m3 the cubes were placed with one face laying flat on the underlayer but not in a regular pattern and porosities of 0 25 0 30 and 0 40 were considered the tests were performed in a flume with a 1 v 30h foreshore slope and a structure slope of 1 v 1 5h tests were conducted for various relative freeboard r c d n where r c represents the structure freeboard conditions 2 1 5 2 and 11 1 three different filter mass ranges m 50 filter m c where m 50 filter represents the median mass of the filter layer of 1 10 1 5 1 20 1 10 and 1 50 and three wave steepnesses s om 0 03 0 05 and 0 06 were tested the test results showed that a lower structure porosity p 0 25 corresponds to a more stable structure larger stability number n s with fewer displacements the larger filter results in a slightly less stable top layer than the mid filter grading tests with the smaller filter showed some erosion of the filter through the gaps of the armour layer no clear conclusion could be drawn from the results on the influence of the wave steepness on the structure stability start of damage and failure occur for lower wave heights for the tests with larger water depth according to van gent et al 1999 this could be related to the ratio of h 2 h s where h 2 represents the wave heights exceeded by 2 of all wave heights which is higher for deeper than shallower water conditions and therefore larger waves will impact the structure another reason could be associated with the longer slope below still water level swl for the deeper water case for the same percentage of displaced units below swl n od is higher for the deeper water case van gent et al 2001 analysed the test results of triemstra 2000 for a single layer cube armour with normal density d n 0 0443 m m c 0 203 kg ρ c 2328 kg m3 and high density concrete d n 0 0221 m m c 0 042 kg ρ c 3907 kg m3 the physical model setup was similar to the one of van gent et al 1999 the best performance higher stability was obtained in general for a lower structure porosity p 0 25 washing out of filter rocks through the gaps in the armour occurred for the smaller filter m 50 filter m c 1 75 the larger filter 1 10th of the cube mass showed better performance the results also show that there is a tendency that lower wave steepnesses lead to initial damage at lower wave heights initial damage for normal and high density cubes occurs roughly at the same n s for a structure porosity of 0 30 for p 0 25 the normal density cubes showed initial damage at slightly higher stability numbers than the high density cubes similar stability is achieved with less concrete volume when high density is used van buchem 2009 carried out eighteen tests in a small scale physical model for a single layer of cubes d n 0 045 m m c 0 171 kg ρ c 1875 kg m3 regularly placed the foreshore was flat and two structure slopes 1 v 2h and 1 v 1 5h were tested for structure porosities of 0 20 0 28 and 0 35 and wave steepnesses of 0 02 0 04 and 0 06 a filter layer with m 50 filter m c 1 20 1 10 and a relative freeboard of r c d n 6 7 was adopted in all tests the number of waves in each test was set to 1000 and therefore if no damage occurred during this period no damage curves could be obtained it was found that a gentler structure slope 1 v 2h was less stable than a steeper slope 1 v 1 5h which demonstrates the importance of the friction effects on the structure stability the best results in terms of stability were obtained for a structure porosity of 0 28 compared to 0 20 and 0 35 larger damage occurred for higher wave steepnesses 0 04 and 0 06 compared to 0 02 the van gent et al 1999 physical model experiment was reproduced by almeida 2013 a single layer cube d n 0 036 m m c 0 110 kg ρ c 2433 kg m3 with regular placement and porosities of 0 25 and 0 30 were tested the results showed that the best results higher stability are achieved for a lower structure porosity p 0 25 higher porosities result in large gaps at the intersection between the slope and crest a filter layer grading of 1 20th to 1 10th of the cube mass has shown to be more stable than the 1 50th some erosion of the filter layer occurred for a filter of 1 50th of the cube mass the sensitivity to wave steepness is inconclusive as it was found that the structure is more stable for a wave steepness of 0 06 but the start of damage occurs earlier for a wave steepness of 0 05 it was also found that the failure is more sudden for higher water levels according to almeida 2013 this is likely because in the higher water level case the structure is almost submerged and the initial damage occurs at the crest which then propagates down the slope the results are generally in agreement with van gent et al 1999 but higher stability numbers for failure were obtained the causes for these differences are not entirely clear but can be related to the fact that in van gent et al 1999 the cubes were placed randomly but with one face lying flat on the underlayer as opposed to this experiment were a regular placement was implemented other factors such as model construction methods materials used measurement techniques and analysis tools can also contribute to the differences in results van gent 2014 carried out physical model experiments to assess the effect of wave obliquity in various types of armour units the structure had a single layer armour of cubes d n 0 025 m with a porosity of 0 25 on a 1 v 1 5h slope the influence of oblique waves was found to be larger for cubes in a single layer than for cubes in a double layer and for rock likely due to the smoother surface of the armour layer a more gradual damage progression with increased wave angle was observed van der lem et al 2016 presented the results of physical model tests for the sal rei breakwater in boavista island cape verde the 2d tests were done for assessing the stability of single layer cubes placed regularly with a porosity of 0 28 on a 1 v 1 5h slope under specific design conditions and not for developing damage curves they found that the stability number for failure assumed as n od 0 2 occurred at an approximate value of 2 5 a summary of the range of test conditions from the existing literature is presented in table 4 the stability numbers for n od 0 05 and n od 0 2 range from 1 7 to 3 9 and 2 1 to 4 5 respectively considering all test results available fig 4 there is a relatively wide range of stability numbers obtained in the various studies the values are derived from an extensive range of test conditions with several tests aimed at performing sensitivity analysis on parameters such as filter layer and porosity some of the tested values are in reality not feasible or effective in prototype cases such as porosity of 0 4 or filter mass m 50 filter m c less than 1 20 fig 4 shows filtered data that correspond to tests for a structure configuration with a slope of 1 v 1 5h emerged structure a porosity of 0 25 0 30 and filter mass larger than 1 20th of the armour unit the stability numbers for n od 0 05 and n od 0 2 range from 2 3 to 3 9 and 2 5 to 4 5 respectively which are larger than if all tests are considered 3 2 2 wave overtopping regularly placed single layer cubes with very low porosity 0 are considered smooth structures in terms of wave run up and overtopping several overtopping studies have been conducted for smooth slope structures such as owen 1980 owen and steele 1993 van gent et al 1999 this type of structure has a roughness factor γ f of 1 0 eurotop et al 2007 a limited number of studies have focused on the evaluation of overtopping performance for breakwaters with a single layer of cubes regularly placed with low porosity values 0 25 0 35 bruce et al 2006 presented the results of pearson et al 2004 from an extensive laboratory test programme which was part of the clash project the tests for a single layer of cubes d n 0 030 m m 0 062 kg ρ cubes 2361 kg m3 adopted a stability number n s 2 2 a porosity of 0 30 was chosen but the actual built structure had a porosity of 0 35 tests were carried out for a spectral significant wave height h m0 h 0 0 75h 0 and 0 5h 0 where h 0 is the wave height under design conditions derived from the stability number n s 2 2 a flat seabed was adopted in the model and therefore h m0 at the wavemaker is similar to h m0 at the toe of the structure each wave height was repeated for three offshore wave steepnesses s op 0 02 0 035 and 0 05 and two relative freeboard levels r c h 0 1 3 and 0 8 water depths of 2 5h 0 and 3 0h 0 were imposed for all tests to avoid wave breaking the structure slope was 1 v 1 5h and the crest and toe were 3d n wide the weight of the underlayer material was in the range of 1 5th to 1 15th of the weight of the armour blocks the best fit of mean overtopping rate q between the data and the van der meer and janssen 1994 formula was obtained for γ f 0 50 bruce et al 2009 re analysed the database and obtained γ f 0 52 it is important to highlight that the values presented in this section are different from those of table 3 the roughness factors in table 3 are 5 lower as the roughness factor for a smooth slope obtained in pearson et al 2004 was 1 05 and therefore all values obtained for the various armour configurations are reduced by 5 molines and medina 2015 re analysed the clash database and derived roughness factors based on various overtopping estimators the optimum roughness factors were estimated by minimizing the relative mean squared error between measurements and different γ f were obtained for the various estimators table 5 there is generally a good fit for the pearson et al 2004 test results compared to van der meer and janssen 1994 formula in particular for γ f 0 52 fig 5 in eurotop 2018 it is proposed to use the van der meer and bruce 2014 equation with γ f given by bruce et al 2009 however the overtopping values for a relative freeboard of r c h m0 2 0 are under estimated in this case a slightly better prediction is obtained with γ f 0 53 molines et al 2015 chen et al 2020 presented wave overtopping results for mild slope 1 v 3h revetments impermeable core with regularly placed single layer cubes but these results cannot be directly applied to breakwaters permeable core and steeper slopes the study found that the roughness influence is considerably overestimated by the taw method taw 2002 using the roughness factor presented in eurotop 2018 and therefore this factor may not be reasonable for dikes with an impermeable core 3 3 knowledge gaps and future research 3 3 1 hydraulic stability the ranges of stability numbers for single layer cube armoured breakwaters obtained from available studies present a relatively large variability which leads to a high degree of uncertainty for preliminary design purposes this may be explained by several reasons such as cube placement model construction methods differences in materials and scale used different structure configurations or measurement techniques and analysis tools adopted in the various studies model armour layer responses are usually described using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods including visual assessment not all of which can be covered by generic guidelines garcia et al 2013 the evolution of the armour layer is typically described by quantifying unit extraction rocking of units rotation of units settlement and changes in packing density one of the most common methods for quantifying stability in concrete armour units is the relative damage parameter n od n od when applied to double layer systems is a relatively objective criterion as it provides valuable information on the damage evolution which is a gradual process in these structures corresponding to the development of an s shape profile until exposure of the filter layer the classic methodologies to measure damage do not reflect the real behaviour of a single layer armour system these methodologies account for one piece movement if it moves more than one d n thus they do not allow to measure the settlements and analyse the first phases of damage which are very important in breakwaters with rigid behaviour sande et al 2018 n od is not an adequate method for providing quantitative assessments of damage in single layer cube armoured breakwaters since the extraction of one unit from the armour layer which could correspond to a very low n od results in exposure of the filter layer failure unlike double layer systems for example assuming a d n 0 04 m a flume width of 1 0 m the extraction of 1 unit corresponds to a n od d n 0 04 this means that the start of damage and failure for this structure occurs for any n od 0 and information on the armour layer evolution leading to the unit extraction is unknown this method also does not provide detailed information on full armour layer evolution and associated damage as it does not quantify unit rocking rotation or changes in packing density along the slope which eventually may lead to extraction or large displacement of armour units small armour displacements without unit extraction may lead to exposure of the filter layer and subsequent damage phases may follow up quickly brittle failure failure exposure of underlayer can occur for very low values of n od only one gap of length d n50 filter is sufficient to be considered failure for example let us consider a cube size of d n a porosity of 0 25 and a rock filter layer with mcube m50 filter 15 and ρ r 2650 kg m3 d n50 filter d n 0 4 the horizontal gap distance is then gap d n 0 33 or gap d n50 filter 0 85 fig 6 assuming one cube moves horizontally by a distance of 0 1d n it will create a gap between adjacent cubes of gap d n 0 43 or gap d n50 filter 1 10 in this case the cube has only been displaced from the original position by 0 1d n that is typically considered no displacement but this displacement has caused exposure of the filter layer with the potential consequences of extraction of filter through the gaps in the armour fig 6 whilst in this case it is assumed that a gap larger than d n50 filter could result in extraction of the filter layer in reality given the grading curve of the filter layer and random placement of rock it would be difficult to confirm if all gaps larger than d n50 filter would result in actual extraction of filter rocks or if this would only occur after a certain number of waves perhaps the extraction of some of the smaller rocks does not cause any significant impact on the overall slope integrity additional testing specifically aiming at understanding this issue would provide essential information on defining the appropriate gap tolerances and the maximum admissible limits for the motion of the armour layer blocks which are supposed to be related to the block placement pattern selected armour porosity and subsequent gap distances between units and grading of the filter material the gap size in the analysis needs to be defined in terms of size area but also taking into consideration the vertical horizontal v h ratio in an ideal structure the vertical gap is close to d n which if the horizontal gap distance is small will unlikely result in the extraction of filter layer rocks however rearrangement of armour units may lead to different h v gap ratios n od is defined differently by various researchers a unit can be considered displaced if it moves out of its original location by a certain factor of the distance d n this factor is typically assumed as one 1d n for being considered displacement hellinga 2016 used lower factors for the assessment of the damage of single layer cubes on the rear side of breakwaters cubes with large displacement higher than 0 3d n were considered for the calculation of armour damage the method used in loman et al 2012 to quantify damage in a single layer armour of cubes in a revetment for the sea defence of maasvlakte 2 is more adequate since it considers gaps between cubes exceeding the size of one cube d n in addition to cube displacements of more than 1d n for calculation of n od this method also accounts for gaps created by settlement or heterogeneous packing however gaps smaller than d n which are not accounted for may still result in the exposure of the underlayer and subsequently be considered failure another limitation in loman et al 2012 method is that one gap width of d n or one cube displaced by a distance of 1d n will most likely result in the exposure of the underlayer despite n od corresponding to a small value niels 2018 highlights an important aspect for regularly placed single layer cube armour units where the lack of overlay between cubes in the upper and lower rows may displace the cube in the upper row and cause settlement of the rows above resulting in possible damage failure to the structure fig 7 although the methods described previously are an improvement in comparison to the description of damage levels for double layer systems which only take into account the number of displaced extracted units it still lacks consistency and generalization to broadly be applied in single layer cube systems with a regular placement pattern it also does not provide information on the evolution of the armour unit movement and associated damage level another aspect still not fully investigated and most relevant in construction sites where wave conditions are relatively rough is the influence of the underlayer profile irregularities on the displacement of units from the armour layer van den berg et al 2020 analysed the effect of the underlayer irregularities on the stability of the xblocplus concrete armour unit it was found that large scale convex protruding outwards undulations on the underlayer influenced the stability of the armour layer and recommendations on underlayer profile tolerances are provided for that type of block this could be also a relevant aspect to take into account when designing regularly placed single layer cube armour structures that have relatively strict placement tolerances on one hand a larger m 50 filter provides more porosity thus increasing hydraulic stability and also allows for larger cube displacements as gaps can be slightly larger before rocks from the filter layer get extracted through the gaps but on the other hand the irregularities of the filter layer will likely be larger which can affect the cube placement pattern and consequently reducing the stability of the armour layer the above mentioned aspects are mainly aimed at the trunk slope of the structure which typically corresponds to the longest section of a breakwater and therefore receives the most attention and focuses on research studies however other components of a breakwater such as crest and roundhead are crucial for the overall integrity of a breakwater detailed research on crest stability of regularly placed single layer cube armour structures is not available in the available literature there is an indication that unless the breakwater is subject to limited overtopping the crest units may have to be larger than those of the slope or a different configuration should be implemented to ensure adequate stability in terms of roundheads the only information available is in van der lem et al 2016 where it is mentioned that in contrast to normal practice the steepness of the breakwater slope at the roundhead as well as the cube size was kept similar to the breakwater trunk it is important to quantify the evolution of movements that lead to exposure of the filter layer some options proposed for a detailed evaluation of the armour damage evolution are to be analysed for the top center and bottom areas of the slope relate the number of units displaced for the various displacement classes to be defined according to test results with stability number this would provide evidence of whether there are many small movements before a large displacement occurs an analysis of the results of almeida 2013 show that a cube was only removed from the armour layer after 28 of the armour units moved and a corresponding n s 3 9 fig 8 results for other test series with different porosity and wave steepness did not show any cube removed from the armour layer for higher relative number of displaced units 32 relate the number and magnitude of gap distances or distance between adjacent cubes between all cubes in the slope through a regularity index ri and its evolution with the stability number being a regular placement it is relatively straightforward to identify how much the constructed and subsequent damaged armour unit placement grid is modified from the ideal perfect placement grid initial placement may also play an important role in the damage evolution of the armour layer this index could provide information on how well the structure is built and what is the influence on the damage evolution relate settlement with stability number hofland and van gent 2016 developed a method for quantification of settlement in single layer systems aspects like rocking toe support changes in packing density movement of the entire armour layer will result in settlement after a test these results can provide an insight into potential settlement thresholds before a unit is extracted from the armour layer categories of the different damage levels for double layer systems were proposed by losada et al 1986 and vidal et al 1991 as follows initiation of damage ida a certain number of armour units are displaced from their original position at a distance of or larger than a unit length and or holes larger than average porous size are clearly appreciable iribarren damage ir armour units from the lower armour layer are exposed initiation of destruction ide a small number of units is removed from the lower armour layer and the filter is exposed destruction filter layer units are removed these definitions are not directly applicable to single layer systems and therefore a new classification is proposed for ida ida for single layer idasl can be defined when units are displaced from their original position considered as displacements of armour units by less than a unit length but the filter layer is not exposed for example if gaps between units are smaller than filter size d n50 filter and therefore the structure still provides some level of protection ir is not applicable for single layer systems the definition of ide for single layer systems idesl can be adopted as when the filter layer is exposed due to large holes gaps in the armour layer destruction will occur when the filter material starts to be removed a flowchart of the proposed levels of damage and associated damage parameters and structure behaviour is presented in fig 9 where ri0 represents the regularity index of the as built structure it is recommended that future physical model tests adopt the proposed damage levels definition to try to identify thresholds for stability number percentage of displaced units and regularity index for the different classes sensitivity to the thresholds should be assessed for various structure porosities wave steepnesses number of waves and all other parameters that may influence the stability of the armour layer knowledge of the damage evolution and failure processes in this type of structure needs to be investigated more exhaustively using modern techniques that can provide detailed information on individual armour movements as well as the definition of overall parameters that characterize the condition of the whole slope or structure the studies mentioned in section 3 2 1 made use of photographic overlay methods for quantification of unit displacements recent high resolution technologies such as digital stereo photography dsp or laser scanners with typical sub millimetre accuracy have been successfully applied to assess damage in rock and concrete armoured breakwaters rigden and stewart 2012 molines et al 2012a puente et al 2014 shen et al 2018 de almeida et al 2019 these techniques would provide additional information on the damage areas settlements variation in porosity along the slope crest and roundhead identification of position and configuration of units at trigger points for the initiation of damage 3 3 2 wave overtopping available wave overtopping studies for regularly placed cube armoured breakwaters are limited to the tests of pearson et al 2004 although this study provides a solid base for research in this type of configuration additional research is required to assess the influence of armour porosity on wave overtopping rates this was done for other concrete units molines et al 2012b molines and medina 2015 presented a method for calculating the roughness factor for different armour porosities based on the clash database van der meer et al 2009 and the clash neural network method van gent et al 2007 armour units placed with higher porosity tend to have a smaller roughness factor resulting in lower overtopping rates molines and medina 2015 the recommended roughness factor for overtopping estimates with a single layer regularly placed cube armour in eurotop 2018 is based on the tests of pearson et al 2004 however it is unlikely that a prototype will be constructed with a porosity of 0 35 as tested in pearson et al 2004 since it will result in a structure with lower hydraulic stability performance better hydraulic stability has been achieved for porosities between 0 25 and 0 30 the available physical model tests also focused on a specific range of relative freeboard values 0 8 and 1 3 further investigation on low crested structures r c h m0 0 5 and low overtopping structures r c h m0 1 5 would be valuable for extending the range of applicability of the empirical formulations or adjusting these formulations in general there is very limited information on the effect of wave obliquity on wave overtopping particularly for single layer cube armoured breakwaters more detailed information on wave overtopping could be obtained through recently developed techniques which combine video imagery with deep learning algorithms e g den bieman et al 2020 these imagery based techniques provide additional information in terms of the spatial and temporal domains without the use of any sensors that can have interference with the physical processes in addition to providing detailed information on wave overtopping the measurements based on imagery can be useful to understand better the relation between overtopping and rear side damage 4 conclusions the sizing of armour units and crest levels in rubble mound structures is typically based on empirical formulations specifically developed for the different types of units these formulations are based on many laboratory tests and experience with prototypes a review of available studies on hydraulic stability and wave overtopping for single layer cube armoured breakwaters is presented this is an innovative solution obtained by combining cube units in a single layer with a regular placement pattern with medium porosity 0 25 0 30 test results show that this configuration is relatively stable and provides several advantages over other units such as the simple formwork and placement grid which can be major constraints on construction sites however it also has some disadvantages such as the difficult regular cube placement pattern under wave action the brittle failure after the start of damage associated with single layer armour behaviour and higher concrete volumes compared to other single layer systems the review of available literature indicates a relatively wide range of stability numbers that lead to a high degree of uncertainty for preliminary design purposes this raises the need for additional research similar to what is available for double layer cube armoured structures another limitation associated with this type of structure is related to the inappropriate methods currently used for quantification of damage evolution that are similar to the ones applied in double layer concrete armour unit structures regularly placed single layer cube armoured structures are not as flexible as double layer armour structures but are also not as rigid as friction type concrete armour unit such as seabee and shed structures therefore one of the key research questions related to hydraulic stability is how much is the structure allowed to move between the initiation of damage and initiation od destruction knowledge of the damage evolution and failure processes for this configuration needs to be investigated in more detail using modern techniques such as laser scanners that can provide additional information on armour unit movements and overall armour layer behaviour various parameters proposed in this paper could be useful to provide a better insight into the damage evolution processes additional research aspects relate to other components of the structure such as the crest and roundhead or other configurations where little or no investigation has been carried out to date limited research was conducted for wave overtopping in single layer cube armoured breakwaters roughness factors from empirical formulas in the available design guidelines for wave overtopping estimates are based on a limited number of tests for a single structure configuration with a porosity of 0 35 porosities lower than 0 30 are typically preferred to increase the structure hydraulic stability and therefore additional information on the influence of porosity on wave overtopping is essential further research and physical model testing will provide more confidence in the evaluation of hydraulic stability and wave overtopping for single layer cube armour with a regularly placed pattern the tests should aim at assessing other structure configurations shallow foreshores depth limiting conditions seabed steepness toe berm height width and armour and filter placement tolerances

21463,breakwater concrete armour units have been continuously evolving since the 1950s lower concrete consumption increased hydraulic stability reduced wave run up and easier placement techniques are the main drivers of this development a recent innovative solution for breakwater armour based on one of the oldest type of units available consists of a configuration adopting a single layer of concrete cubes placed in a regular pattern and a porosity of 0 25 0 30 this paper presents a summary of the laboratory test results available from literature in terms of hydraulic stability and wave overtopping studies indicate that this is a feasible solution with several advantages over other armour configurations related to the simplicity of the cube unit and placement pattern however there is still some degree of uncertainty in both hydraulic stability and wave overtopping estimates for a structure with this configuration where few laboratory tests have been conducted in comparison to other armour units furthermore the available methods for quantification of damage are not considered adequate for use in single layer cube armour with a regular placement pattern this paper discusses current knowledge gaps and provides guidelines for future research graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydraulic stability wave overtopping breakwaters single layer cube regular placement physical modelling 1 introduction a breakwater main function is to protect port s entrances basins and berths to ensure safe navigation and operation in these areas the breakwater armour stone or block weight is a critical parameter in the design of the structure the choice between rock and concrete armour units for the armour layer in a project typically depends on the availability of an adequate rock grading constructability or cost related aspects construction costs depend on numerous factors these being associated to design and logistic factors including the type of armour material unreinforced concrete granite rock sandstone rock etc armour unit mass personnel and material unit costs total concrete consumption placement equipment casting handling and stacking procedures medina et al 2014 during the design process once a unit is selected guidelines for placement hydraulic stability and wave overtopping are available for the various types of concrete units e g ciria 2007 eurotop et al 2007 the empirical formulas in the guidelines are based on laboratory research and experience with prototypes the use of single layer cubes with a regularly placed pattern and low porosity 0 20 0 35 on the seaside of breakwaters is a recent concept and therefore the application of empirical formulas from available guidelines should be viewed with care studies on hydraulic stability and wave overtopping are relatively few compared to other units and only one prototype fig 1 with such configuration has been built to date van der lem et al 2016 this review paper summarizes the state of the art for single layer cube armoured breakwaters identifies gaps in knowledge and presents future research challenges the paper is organized as follows after a brief introduction in section 1 a summary of the use and performance of concrete armour cubes is presented in section 2 section 3 describes the laboratory test results of hydraulic stability and wave overtopping for single layer cube armoured breakwaters knowledge gaps identified in the literature on this breakwater armour configuration are also reported and future research directions provided section 4 presents the main conclusions of this study 2 concrete armour cube structures 2 1 introduction cubes or parallelepipeds are the simplest types of concrete armour unit which have been applied in different configurations table 1 in either physical models or prototypes in regions where rock is not available such as the netherlands cubes or other types of concrete blocks are typically adopted for impermeable patterned block revetments in dike protections klein breteler et al 2014 cubes in patterned block revetments with very low porosity mainly rely on friction between units as a stabilizing force concrete cubes for breakwater armour are traditionally built in a two layer system and with a random placement pattern the cubes of the first layer tend to slide and align with the slope thus creating a less permeable surface which could be subject to excessive pore pressure and subsequent lifting of the blocks muttray and reedjik 2009 the second layer provides additional resilience and aids in increasing permeability which improves hydraulic stability and reduces wave run up when placed randomly the stability of the blocks is obtained primarily through their weight concrete hollow parallelepipeds in a regularly placed pattern have been used on the lee side of breakwaters e g burcharth et al 2015 double layer the stability of a randomly placed double layer of cubes has also been investigated in low crest breakwaters argente et al 2018 table 1 shows different examples of cube armoured breakwater configurations other types of structure configurations common in other units such as coastal revetments berm breakwaters or low crest submerged breakwaters using regularly placed single layer cubes with low porosity 0 3 have still not been thoroughly investigated and applied for example information on single layer cube armoured low crest or submerged breakwaters is limited to few tests e g almeida 2013 unlike other units e g muttray et al 2012 argente et al 2018 where detailed studies have been conducted a regularly placed cube armoured lower slope and berm was adopted in van gent and van der werf 2017 but the focus of the study was to assess the stability of the upper slope built of rock and not the lower slope or the berm 2 2 hydraulic stability detailed research on hydraulic stability of double layer cube armoured breakwaters include cube concrete density triemstra 2000 density of cube placement van den bosch et al 2002 armour porosity and placement methods medina et al 2010 wave obliquity van gent 2003 wolters and van gent 2010 van gent 2014 and roundhead stability vidal et al 1991 maciñeira and burcharth 2007 maciñeira and burcharth 2016 damage in concrete armour layer systems is typically defined by the relative damage number n od proposed by van der meer 1988 as the number of displaced units within a strip of width d n defined as 1 n o d n o b d n where n o represents the number of units displaced out of the armour layer b the width of the tested section and d n the armour unit nominal diameter or equivalent cube length van der meer 1988 developed an empirical formula based on small scale tests with a slope of 1 v 1 5h on a uniform 1 v 30h foreshore slope to estimate the stability number n s in double layer cube armoured breakwaters for a fixed value of related damage number 2 n s h s δ d n 6 7 n o d 0 4 n 0 3 1 0 s o m 0 1 where h s represents the significant wave height δ ρ c ρ w 1 the relative buoyant density with ρ c the rock or concrete density and ρ w the water density n the number of waves and s o m the deepwater wave steepness defined as s o m h m 0 l o m where l o m represents the deepwater wavelength based on the mean wave period t m the use of single layer armour systems has increased since the development of the accropode unit the main advantage of a single layer armour is the concrete volume reduction compared to double layer systems van der meer 1999 found that the start of damage in single layer armour unit systems accropode and core loc occurs at very high stability numbers however the start of damage in single layer armour unit systems is usually followed by a sudden failure and therefore additional safety factors should be applied to provide some margin due to their failure mechanism medina and gomez martin 2012 the initial damage in double layer cube armour structures occurs at lower stability numbers than for single layer structures fig 2 even assuming the definition of failure different for double n od 2 and single layer n od 0 2 as defined in van gent 2003 and van gent and luís 2013 available results show that the failure still occurs at higher stability numbers for single layer structures fig 2 however the damage curves show that for double layer structures it occurs more gradually than for single layers van gent et al 1999 concluded that the performance of single layer cube armour systems is good and that the strength of single top layers seems to be a combination of strength due to weight as for double top layers strength due to contact forces between adjacent blocks as for placed block revetments and less wave attack on single units due to a smoother surface of the entire slope van gent 2003 carried out small scale tests to assess the influence of wave obliquity on the stability of double and single layer cube armoured structures test results show that to reach the same amount of damage e g n od 0 2 a considerable higher wave height is required in the case of cubes in a single layer if the angle of wave attack is 30 or more for cubes in a single layer the wave height compared to perpendicular wave attack needs to be a factor for increased stability number n s of about 2 2 5 higher for an angle of wave attack of 45 whilst for cubes in a double layer this factor is about 1 5 a summary of the stability numbers recommended in ciria 2007 for the design of breakwaters trunk and roundhead sections for cube armour units is presented in table 2 similar stability numbers for single and double layer are proposed for the trunk section which would result in the same unit weight the armour layer stability at breakwaters roundheads is critical with respect to the exposure of the breakwater head muttray and reedijk 2009 this is related to the location of the roundhead usually in deeper water than the trunk and therefore exposed to more energetic wave conditions additionally due to the curvature of the roundhead and subsequent implications such as deviation of unit placement from a regular grid and larger gaps between units reduced stability that the trunk section is typically achieved muttray and reedijk 2009 for double layer cube armour ciria 2007 recommends a lower stability number for the roundhead than for the trunk table 2 to our knowledge investigation on stability of roundheads in single layer cube armoured breakwaters was not published to date and therefore no value is presented in table 2 for other units such as the cubipod sande et al 2018 show that roundheads with double layer armour have stability values similar to that of the single ones under certain conditions 2 3 wave overtopping wave overtopping is a critical aspect of the design and performance of a breakwater several research works in wave overtopping in double layer cube armoured breakwaters have been conducted e g pearson et al 2004 andersen and burcharth 2009 molines et al 2012b mares nassare et al 2019 mean overtopping rates can be estimated with the empirical formula of van der meer and janssen 1994 3 q g h m 0 3 0 2 e x p 2 6 r c h m 0 1 γ f where q represents the mean overtopping discharge h m0 the spectral significant wave height r c the crest freeboard the difference between the still water level and crest elevation and γ f the roughness factor wave overtopping in single layer systems are typically higher due to the lower structure permeability e g molines and medina 2015 for comparison between double and single layer armour of cubipods roughness factors to be applied in eq 3 for different armour layer configurations were estimated in bruce et al 2009 based on small scale model tests double layer systems have lower roughness factors table 3 due to the additional armour layer which provides increased permeability and associated lower wave run up wave overtopping is also expected to be higher in the case of a single layer of cubes than for other one layer systems due to the lower roughness of the cube several studies to assess the influence of wave obliquity on overtopping rates in rubble mound structures have been carried out to date e g galland 1994 andersen and burcharth 2009 nørgaard et al 2013 van gent and van der werf 2019 mares nassare and van gent 2020 andersen and burcharth 2009 show that for rubble mound structures overtopping discharge decreases with increasing wave obliquity and propose reduction factors for short and long crested waves the study also indicates that two layers of randomly placed cubes give just slightly more overtopping than rock armour to the authors knowledge there is no information available on the influence of wave obliquity on overtopping rates for single layer cube armoured structures for comparison against a double layer configuration 3 single layer cube armoured breakwaters 3 1 armour unit placement the placement of single layer interlocking armour units on a breakwater slope has to meet strict requirements for armour unit position and contact points with neighbouring units and slope reedijk et al 2018 a regular placement pattern is understandable simpler and typically preferred in construction sites another advantage of the regular placement is the increased hydraulic stability when compared to randomly placed configurations hald et al 1998 showed that higher stability was achieved when using orderly methods of placement for single layer rock armour units for breakwaters in norway safari et al 2018 compared a regular to random placement of single layer starbloc armour units and found that higher stability numbers are achieved with the regular pattern placement the regular placement of cubes needs to be carefully controlled to achieve the required gap distance between cubes and subsequently the specified porosity the gaps provide a solution for the excess pore pressure gradients when cubes are closely spaced to each other as in very low porosity block revetments in small scale laboratory tests it is feasible to place a single layer of cubes with the required precision however it is uncertain if a specified placing density can be achieved in prototype situations tests have been carried out by verhagen et al 2002 to determine the requirements for dropping concrete blocks from a crane onto a breakwater slope the conclusion is that at a water depth of approximately 10 times the block size this can be achieved and for smaller depths this placing density can be reached without too many difficulties single layer concrete cubes with a regular placement pattern for breakwater armour is a relatively new configuration van gent and luís 2013 concluded that a breakwater with cubes in a single layer is feasible and potentially economically competitive with other single layer units despite having a lower stability number the main advantages of a single layer of cubes compared to other one layer systems are the simplicity of formwork in fabrication high structural strength patent free smaller casting yard area requirements since the removal of the formwork is done vertically safer handling using pressure clamps whilst some other units make use of rope slings efficient area utilization for stacking simple placement grid the lower likelihood of breaking units during construction greater production rate and easier repair works disadvantages are related to the low resilience offered if some blocks are extracted or settlement occurs as in any single layer configuration negligible interlocking between units higher concrete consumption compared to other single layer units and difficulties during construction in the presence of waves due to a strict placement tolerance 3 2 laboratory tests on single layer cube armoured breakwaters 3 2 1 hydraulic stability experimental studies focused on the evaluation of the stability performance of a single layer armour of cubes with low porosity values have been ongoing for the last twenty years several researchers van gent and spaan 1998 d angremond et al 1999 van gent et al 1999 2001 have studied the feasibility of a single layer cube armoured breakwater with porosities between 0 25 and 0 40 with an irregular placement fig 3 left more recent research van buchem 2009 almeida 2013 van gent 2014 van gent and luís 2013 van der lem et al 2016 van gent and van der werf 2017 investigated the combination of a single layer cube armour breakwater with a regular placement fig 3 right van gent et al 1999 carried out small scale physical model tests on a single armour layer of cubes d n 0 036 m cube mass m c 0 110 kg ρ c 2433 kg m3 the cubes were placed with one face laying flat on the underlayer but not in a regular pattern and porosities of 0 25 0 30 and 0 40 were considered the tests were performed in a flume with a 1 v 30h foreshore slope and a structure slope of 1 v 1 5h tests were conducted for various relative freeboard r c d n where r c represents the structure freeboard conditions 2 1 5 2 and 11 1 three different filter mass ranges m 50 filter m c where m 50 filter represents the median mass of the filter layer of 1 10 1 5 1 20 1 10 and 1 50 and three wave steepnesses s om 0 03 0 05 and 0 06 were tested the test results showed that a lower structure porosity p 0 25 corresponds to a more stable structure larger stability number n s with fewer displacements the larger filter results in a slightly less stable top layer than the mid filter grading tests with the smaller filter showed some erosion of the filter through the gaps of the armour layer no clear conclusion could be drawn from the results on the influence of the wave steepness on the structure stability start of damage and failure occur for lower wave heights for the tests with larger water depth according to van gent et al 1999 this could be related to the ratio of h 2 h s where h 2 represents the wave heights exceeded by 2 of all wave heights which is higher for deeper than shallower water conditions and therefore larger waves will impact the structure another reason could be associated with the longer slope below still water level swl for the deeper water case for the same percentage of displaced units below swl n od is higher for the deeper water case van gent et al 2001 analysed the test results of triemstra 2000 for a single layer cube armour with normal density d n 0 0443 m m c 0 203 kg ρ c 2328 kg m3 and high density concrete d n 0 0221 m m c 0 042 kg ρ c 3907 kg m3 the physical model setup was similar to the one of van gent et al 1999 the best performance higher stability was obtained in general for a lower structure porosity p 0 25 washing out of filter rocks through the gaps in the armour occurred for the smaller filter m 50 filter m c 1 75 the larger filter 1 10th of the cube mass showed better performance the results also show that there is a tendency that lower wave steepnesses lead to initial damage at lower wave heights initial damage for normal and high density cubes occurs roughly at the same n s for a structure porosity of 0 30 for p 0 25 the normal density cubes showed initial damage at slightly higher stability numbers than the high density cubes similar stability is achieved with less concrete volume when high density is used van buchem 2009 carried out eighteen tests in a small scale physical model for a single layer of cubes d n 0 045 m m c 0 171 kg ρ c 1875 kg m3 regularly placed the foreshore was flat and two structure slopes 1 v 2h and 1 v 1 5h were tested for structure porosities of 0 20 0 28 and 0 35 and wave steepnesses of 0 02 0 04 and 0 06 a filter layer with m 50 filter m c 1 20 1 10 and a relative freeboard of r c d n 6 7 was adopted in all tests the number of waves in each test was set to 1000 and therefore if no damage occurred during this period no damage curves could be obtained it was found that a gentler structure slope 1 v 2h was less stable than a steeper slope 1 v 1 5h which demonstrates the importance of the friction effects on the structure stability the best results in terms of stability were obtained for a structure porosity of 0 28 compared to 0 20 and 0 35 larger damage occurred for higher wave steepnesses 0 04 and 0 06 compared to 0 02 the van gent et al 1999 physical model experiment was reproduced by almeida 2013 a single layer cube d n 0 036 m m c 0 110 kg ρ c 2433 kg m3 with regular placement and porosities of 0 25 and 0 30 were tested the results showed that the best results higher stability are achieved for a lower structure porosity p 0 25 higher porosities result in large gaps at the intersection between the slope and crest a filter layer grading of 1 20th to 1 10th of the cube mass has shown to be more stable than the 1 50th some erosion of the filter layer occurred for a filter of 1 50th of the cube mass the sensitivity to wave steepness is inconclusive as it was found that the structure is more stable for a wave steepness of 0 06 but the start of damage occurs earlier for a wave steepness of 0 05 it was also found that the failure is more sudden for higher water levels according to almeida 2013 this is likely because in the higher water level case the structure is almost submerged and the initial damage occurs at the crest which then propagates down the slope the results are generally in agreement with van gent et al 1999 but higher stability numbers for failure were obtained the causes for these differences are not entirely clear but can be related to the fact that in van gent et al 1999 the cubes were placed randomly but with one face lying flat on the underlayer as opposed to this experiment were a regular placement was implemented other factors such as model construction methods materials used measurement techniques and analysis tools can also contribute to the differences in results van gent 2014 carried out physical model experiments to assess the effect of wave obliquity in various types of armour units the structure had a single layer armour of cubes d n 0 025 m with a porosity of 0 25 on a 1 v 1 5h slope the influence of oblique waves was found to be larger for cubes in a single layer than for cubes in a double layer and for rock likely due to the smoother surface of the armour layer a more gradual damage progression with increased wave angle was observed van der lem et al 2016 presented the results of physical model tests for the sal rei breakwater in boavista island cape verde the 2d tests were done for assessing the stability of single layer cubes placed regularly with a porosity of 0 28 on a 1 v 1 5h slope under specific design conditions and not for developing damage curves they found that the stability number for failure assumed as n od 0 2 occurred at an approximate value of 2 5 a summary of the range of test conditions from the existing literature is presented in table 4 the stability numbers for n od 0 05 and n od 0 2 range from 1 7 to 3 9 and 2 1 to 4 5 respectively considering all test results available fig 4 there is a relatively wide range of stability numbers obtained in the various studies the values are derived from an extensive range of test conditions with several tests aimed at performing sensitivity analysis on parameters such as filter layer and porosity some of the tested values are in reality not feasible or effective in prototype cases such as porosity of 0 4 or filter mass m 50 filter m c less than 1 20 fig 4 shows filtered data that correspond to tests for a structure configuration with a slope of 1 v 1 5h emerged structure a porosity of 0 25 0 30 and filter mass larger than 1 20th of the armour unit the stability numbers for n od 0 05 and n od 0 2 range from 2 3 to 3 9 and 2 5 to 4 5 respectively which are larger than if all tests are considered 3 2 2 wave overtopping regularly placed single layer cubes with very low porosity 0 are considered smooth structures in terms of wave run up and overtopping several overtopping studies have been conducted for smooth slope structures such as owen 1980 owen and steele 1993 van gent et al 1999 this type of structure has a roughness factor γ f of 1 0 eurotop et al 2007 a limited number of studies have focused on the evaluation of overtopping performance for breakwaters with a single layer of cubes regularly placed with low porosity values 0 25 0 35 bruce et al 2006 presented the results of pearson et al 2004 from an extensive laboratory test programme which was part of the clash project the tests for a single layer of cubes d n 0 030 m m 0 062 kg ρ cubes 2361 kg m3 adopted a stability number n s 2 2 a porosity of 0 30 was chosen but the actual built structure had a porosity of 0 35 tests were carried out for a spectral significant wave height h m0 h 0 0 75h 0 and 0 5h 0 where h 0 is the wave height under design conditions derived from the stability number n s 2 2 a flat seabed was adopted in the model and therefore h m0 at the wavemaker is similar to h m0 at the toe of the structure each wave height was repeated for three offshore wave steepnesses s op 0 02 0 035 and 0 05 and two relative freeboard levels r c h 0 1 3 and 0 8 water depths of 2 5h 0 and 3 0h 0 were imposed for all tests to avoid wave breaking the structure slope was 1 v 1 5h and the crest and toe were 3d n wide the weight of the underlayer material was in the range of 1 5th to 1 15th of the weight of the armour blocks the best fit of mean overtopping rate q between the data and the van der meer and janssen 1994 formula was obtained for γ f 0 50 bruce et al 2009 re analysed the database and obtained γ f 0 52 it is important to highlight that the values presented in this section are different from those of table 3 the roughness factors in table 3 are 5 lower as the roughness factor for a smooth slope obtained in pearson et al 2004 was 1 05 and therefore all values obtained for the various armour configurations are reduced by 5 molines and medina 2015 re analysed the clash database and derived roughness factors based on various overtopping estimators the optimum roughness factors were estimated by minimizing the relative mean squared error between measurements and different γ f were obtained for the various estimators table 5 there is generally a good fit for the pearson et al 2004 test results compared to van der meer and janssen 1994 formula in particular for γ f 0 52 fig 5 in eurotop 2018 it is proposed to use the van der meer and bruce 2014 equation with γ f given by bruce et al 2009 however the overtopping values for a relative freeboard of r c h m0 2 0 are under estimated in this case a slightly better prediction is obtained with γ f 0 53 molines et al 2015 chen et al 2020 presented wave overtopping results for mild slope 1 v 3h revetments impermeable core with regularly placed single layer cubes but these results cannot be directly applied to breakwaters permeable core and steeper slopes the study found that the roughness influence is considerably overestimated by the taw method taw 2002 using the roughness factor presented in eurotop 2018 and therefore this factor may not be reasonable for dikes with an impermeable core 3 3 knowledge gaps and future research 3 3 1 hydraulic stability the ranges of stability numbers for single layer cube armoured breakwaters obtained from available studies present a relatively large variability which leads to a high degree of uncertainty for preliminary design purposes this may be explained by several reasons such as cube placement model construction methods differences in materials and scale used different structure configurations or measurement techniques and analysis tools adopted in the various studies model armour layer responses are usually described using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods including visual assessment not all of which can be covered by generic guidelines garcia et al 2013 the evolution of the armour layer is typically described by quantifying unit extraction rocking of units rotation of units settlement and changes in packing density one of the most common methods for quantifying stability in concrete armour units is the relative damage parameter n od n od when applied to double layer systems is a relatively objective criterion as it provides valuable information on the damage evolution which is a gradual process in these structures corresponding to the development of an s shape profile until exposure of the filter layer the classic methodologies to measure damage do not reflect the real behaviour of a single layer armour system these methodologies account for one piece movement if it moves more than one d n thus they do not allow to measure the settlements and analyse the first phases of damage which are very important in breakwaters with rigid behaviour sande et al 2018 n od is not an adequate method for providing quantitative assessments of damage in single layer cube armoured breakwaters since the extraction of one unit from the armour layer which could correspond to a very low n od results in exposure of the filter layer failure unlike double layer systems for example assuming a d n 0 04 m a flume width of 1 0 m the extraction of 1 unit corresponds to a n od d n 0 04 this means that the start of damage and failure for this structure occurs for any n od 0 and information on the armour layer evolution leading to the unit extraction is unknown this method also does not provide detailed information on full armour layer evolution and associated damage as it does not quantify unit rocking rotation or changes in packing density along the slope which eventually may lead to extraction or large displacement of armour units small armour displacements without unit extraction may lead to exposure of the filter layer and subsequent damage phases may follow up quickly brittle failure failure exposure of underlayer can occur for very low values of n od only one gap of length d n50 filter is sufficient to be considered failure for example let us consider a cube size of d n a porosity of 0 25 and a rock filter layer with mcube m50 filter 15 and ρ r 2650 kg m3 d n50 filter d n 0 4 the horizontal gap distance is then gap d n 0 33 or gap d n50 filter 0 85 fig 6 assuming one cube moves horizontally by a distance of 0 1d n it will create a gap between adjacent cubes of gap d n 0 43 or gap d n50 filter 1 10 in this case the cube has only been displaced from the original position by 0 1d n that is typically considered no displacement but this displacement has caused exposure of the filter layer with the potential consequences of extraction of filter through the gaps in the armour fig 6 whilst in this case it is assumed that a gap larger than d n50 filter could result in extraction of the filter layer in reality given the grading curve of the filter layer and random placement of rock it would be difficult to confirm if all gaps larger than d n50 filter would result in actual extraction of filter rocks or if this would only occur after a certain number of waves perhaps the extraction of some of the smaller rocks does not cause any significant impact on the overall slope integrity additional testing specifically aiming at understanding this issue would provide essential information on defining the appropriate gap tolerances and the maximum admissible limits for the motion of the armour layer blocks which are supposed to be related to the block placement pattern selected armour porosity and subsequent gap distances between units and grading of the filter material the gap size in the analysis needs to be defined in terms of size area but also taking into consideration the vertical horizontal v h ratio in an ideal structure the vertical gap is close to d n which if the horizontal gap distance is small will unlikely result in the extraction of filter layer rocks however rearrangement of armour units may lead to different h v gap ratios n od is defined differently by various researchers a unit can be considered displaced if it moves out of its original location by a certain factor of the distance d n this factor is typically assumed as one 1d n for being considered displacement hellinga 2016 used lower factors for the assessment of the damage of single layer cubes on the rear side of breakwaters cubes with large displacement higher than 0 3d n were considered for the calculation of armour damage the method used in loman et al 2012 to quantify damage in a single layer armour of cubes in a revetment for the sea defence of maasvlakte 2 is more adequate since it considers gaps between cubes exceeding the size of one cube d n in addition to cube displacements of more than 1d n for calculation of n od this method also accounts for gaps created by settlement or heterogeneous packing however gaps smaller than d n which are not accounted for may still result in the exposure of the underlayer and subsequently be considered failure another limitation in loman et al 2012 method is that one gap width of d n or one cube displaced by a distance of 1d n will most likely result in the exposure of the underlayer despite n od corresponding to a small value niels 2018 highlights an important aspect for regularly placed single layer cube armour units where the lack of overlay between cubes in the upper and lower rows may displace the cube in the upper row and cause settlement of the rows above resulting in possible damage failure to the structure fig 7 although the methods described previously are an improvement in comparison to the description of damage levels for double layer systems which only take into account the number of displaced extracted units it still lacks consistency and generalization to broadly be applied in single layer cube systems with a regular placement pattern it also does not provide information on the evolution of the armour unit movement and associated damage level another aspect still not fully investigated and most relevant in construction sites where wave conditions are relatively rough is the influence of the underlayer profile irregularities on the displacement of units from the armour layer van den berg et al 2020 analysed the effect of the underlayer irregularities on the stability of the xblocplus concrete armour unit it was found that large scale convex protruding outwards undulations on the underlayer influenced the stability of the armour layer and recommendations on underlayer profile tolerances are provided for that type of block this could be also a relevant aspect to take into account when designing regularly placed single layer cube armour structures that have relatively strict placement tolerances on one hand a larger m 50 filter provides more porosity thus increasing hydraulic stability and also allows for larger cube displacements as gaps can be slightly larger before rocks from the filter layer get extracted through the gaps but on the other hand the irregularities of the filter layer will likely be larger which can affect the cube placement pattern and consequently reducing the stability of the armour layer the above mentioned aspects are mainly aimed at the trunk slope of the structure which typically corresponds to the longest section of a breakwater and therefore receives the most attention and focuses on research studies however other components of a breakwater such as crest and roundhead are crucial for the overall integrity of a breakwater detailed research on crest stability of regularly placed single layer cube armour structures is not available in the available literature there is an indication that unless the breakwater is subject to limited overtopping the crest units may have to be larger than those of the slope or a different configuration should be implemented to ensure adequate stability in terms of roundheads the only information available is in van der lem et al 2016 where it is mentioned that in contrast to normal practice the steepness of the breakwater slope at the roundhead as well as the cube size was kept similar to the breakwater trunk it is important to quantify the evolution of movements that lead to exposure of the filter layer some options proposed for a detailed evaluation of the armour damage evolution are to be analysed for the top center and bottom areas of the slope relate the number of units displaced for the various displacement classes to be defined according to test results with stability number this would provide evidence of whether there are many small movements before a large displacement occurs an analysis of the results of almeida 2013 show that a cube was only removed from the armour layer after 28 of the armour units moved and a corresponding n s 3 9 fig 8 results for other test series with different porosity and wave steepness did not show any cube removed from the armour layer for higher relative number of displaced units 32 relate the number and magnitude of gap distances or distance between adjacent cubes between all cubes in the slope through a regularity index ri and its evolution with the stability number being a regular placement it is relatively straightforward to identify how much the constructed and subsequent damaged armour unit placement grid is modified from the ideal perfect placement grid initial placement may also play an important role in the damage evolution of the armour layer this index could provide information on how well the structure is built and what is the influence on the damage evolution relate settlement with stability number hofland and van gent 2016 developed a method for quantification of settlement in single layer systems aspects like rocking toe support changes in packing density movement of the entire armour layer will result in settlement after a test these results can provide an insight into potential settlement thresholds before a unit is extracted from the armour layer categories of the different damage levels for double layer systems were proposed by losada et al 1986 and vidal et al 1991 as follows initiation of damage ida a certain number of armour units are displaced from their original position at a distance of or larger than a unit length and or holes larger than average porous size are clearly appreciable iribarren damage ir armour units from the lower armour layer are exposed initiation of destruction ide a small number of units is removed from the lower armour layer and the filter is exposed destruction filter layer units are removed these definitions are not directly applicable to single layer systems and therefore a new classification is proposed for ida ida for single layer idasl can be defined when units are displaced from their original position considered as displacements of armour units by less than a unit length but the filter layer is not exposed for example if gaps between units are smaller than filter size d n50 filter and therefore the structure still provides some level of protection ir is not applicable for single layer systems the definition of ide for single layer systems idesl can be adopted as when the filter layer is exposed due to large holes gaps in the armour layer destruction will occur when the filter material starts to be removed a flowchart of the proposed levels of damage and associated damage parameters and structure behaviour is presented in fig 9 where ri0 represents the regularity index of the as built structure it is recommended that future physical model tests adopt the proposed damage levels definition to try to identify thresholds for stability number percentage of displaced units and regularity index for the different classes sensitivity to the thresholds should be assessed for various structure porosities wave steepnesses number of waves and all other parameters that may influence the stability of the armour layer knowledge of the damage evolution and failure processes in this type of structure needs to be investigated more exhaustively using modern techniques that can provide detailed information on individual armour movements as well as the definition of overall parameters that characterize the condition of the whole slope or structure the studies mentioned in section 3 2 1 made use of photographic overlay methods for quantification of unit displacements recent high resolution technologies such as digital stereo photography dsp or laser scanners with typical sub millimetre accuracy have been successfully applied to assess damage in rock and concrete armoured breakwaters rigden and stewart 2012 molines et al 2012a puente et al 2014 shen et al 2018 de almeida et al 2019 these techniques would provide additional information on the damage areas settlements variation in porosity along the slope crest and roundhead identification of position and configuration of units at trigger points for the initiation of damage 3 3 2 wave overtopping available wave overtopping studies for regularly placed cube armoured breakwaters are limited to the tests of pearson et al 2004 although this study provides a solid base for research in this type of configuration additional research is required to assess the influence of armour porosity on wave overtopping rates this was done for other concrete units molines et al 2012b molines and medina 2015 presented a method for calculating the roughness factor for different armour porosities based on the clash database van der meer et al 2009 and the clash neural network method van gent et al 2007 armour units placed with higher porosity tend to have a smaller roughness factor resulting in lower overtopping rates molines and medina 2015 the recommended roughness factor for overtopping estimates with a single layer regularly placed cube armour in eurotop 2018 is based on the tests of pearson et al 2004 however it is unlikely that a prototype will be constructed with a porosity of 0 35 as tested in pearson et al 2004 since it will result in a structure with lower hydraulic stability performance better hydraulic stability has been achieved for porosities between 0 25 and 0 30 the available physical model tests also focused on a specific range of relative freeboard values 0 8 and 1 3 further investigation on low crested structures r c h m0 0 5 and low overtopping structures r c h m0 1 5 would be valuable for extending the range of applicability of the empirical formulations or adjusting these formulations in general there is very limited information on the effect of wave obliquity on wave overtopping particularly for single layer cube armoured breakwaters more detailed information on wave overtopping could be obtained through recently developed techniques which combine video imagery with deep learning algorithms e g den bieman et al 2020 these imagery based techniques provide additional information in terms of the spatial and temporal domains without the use of any sensors that can have interference with the physical processes in addition to providing detailed information on wave overtopping the measurements based on imagery can be useful to understand better the relation between overtopping and rear side damage 4 conclusions the sizing of armour units and crest levels in rubble mound structures is typically based on empirical formulations specifically developed for the different types of units these formulations are based on many laboratory tests and experience with prototypes a review of available studies on hydraulic stability and wave overtopping for single layer cube armoured breakwaters is presented this is an innovative solution obtained by combining cube units in a single layer with a regular placement pattern with medium porosity 0 25 0 30 test results show that this configuration is relatively stable and provides several advantages over other units such as the simple formwork and placement grid which can be major constraints on construction sites however it also has some disadvantages such as the difficult regular cube placement pattern under wave action the brittle failure after the start of damage associated with single layer armour behaviour and higher concrete volumes compared to other single layer systems the review of available literature indicates a relatively wide range of stability numbers that lead to a high degree of uncertainty for preliminary design purposes this raises the need for additional research similar to what is available for double layer cube armoured structures another limitation associated with this type of structure is related to the inappropriate methods currently used for quantification of damage evolution that are similar to the ones applied in double layer concrete armour unit structures regularly placed single layer cube armoured structures are not as flexible as double layer armour structures but are also not as rigid as friction type concrete armour unit such as seabee and shed structures therefore one of the key research questions related to hydraulic stability is how much is the structure allowed to move between the initiation of damage and initiation od destruction knowledge of the damage evolution and failure processes for this configuration needs to be investigated in more detail using modern techniques such as laser scanners that can provide additional information on armour unit movements and overall armour layer behaviour various parameters proposed in this paper could be useful to provide a better insight into the damage evolution processes additional research aspects relate to other components of the structure such as the crest and roundhead or other configurations where little or no investigation has been carried out to date limited research was conducted for wave overtopping in single layer cube armoured breakwaters roughness factors from empirical formulas in the available design guidelines for wave overtopping estimates are based on a limited number of tests for a single structure configuration with a porosity of 0 35 porosities lower than 0 30 are typically preferred to increase the structure hydraulic stability and therefore additional information on the influence of porosity on wave overtopping is essential further research and physical model testing will provide more confidence in the evaluation of hydraulic stability and wave overtopping for single layer cube armour with a regularly placed pattern the tests should aim at assessing other structure configurations shallow foreshores depth limiting conditions seabed steepness toe berm height width and armour and filter placement tolerances

21464,rectangular cylinders are insensitive to the reynolds number re due to the geometrically restricted flow separation the introduction of asymmetry e g inclination asymmetric cross section and

and ishihara 2002 sohankar 2006 the wide applications of this flow contain but are not limited to the field of civil engineering e g buildings towers and bridges the field of mechanical engineering e g turbines and heat exchangers and the field of ocean engineering e g offshore platforms risers and pipes from the fluid mechanics point of view the flow over a rectangular cylinder involves plenty of physical phenomena e g flow separation and reattachment vortex formation and shedding and unsteady wake a prominent feature in this type of flow is the fixed point of flow separation at sharp corners which is quite a contrast to the flow past a circular cylinder while the curved surface of circular cylinders permits the shift of separation position or laminar to turbulent transition relying on the reynolds number re ud ν where d is the characteristic length bloor 1964 catalano et al 2003 norberg 2003 williamson 1996 yokuda and ramaprian 1990 the geometrically fixed flow separation of rectangular cylinders renders the influence of re insignificant especially when re is greater than 2 0 104 franke et al 1990 norberg 1993 sohankar 2006 sohankar et al 1999 note that the significant reynolds number effect on the rectangular cylinder flow at low to moderate re e g 70 re 2 0 104 is associated with the flow transition from laminar to turbulent as observed by okajima 1982 which is outside the scope of the present study one way to make the influence of re significant in the moderate to high range is to incorporate asymmetry in the flow configuration mannini et al 2010 found that when the rectangular cylinder with a width to length ratio w l where w and l are the width and length of the rectangular cylinder respectively of 5 0 is inclined at an angle of α 4 the flow features change significantly and the lift coefficient rises as re increases from 2 6 104 to 1 9 106 schewe 2013 experimentally studied the same flow but at several angles of attack over a range of re from 4 0 103 to 6 0 105 and reported similar phenomena of strong reynolds number effect as mannini et al 2010 schewe 2013 also found that the influence of re on the rectangular cylinder with a small w l 0 2 is small due to the lack of flow reattachment moreover when the cross section of a cylinder is asymmetric e g a trapezoidal shaped bridge section the strong effect of re is also exhibited larose and d auteuil 2006 schewe 2001 apart from using geometric modification to gain asymmetric property in the flow another way of achieving that is through introducing an asymmetric boundary condition the problem of concern in this study is the flow past a rectangular cylinder near a free surface the presence of a free surface has a significant influence on the vortex shedding and wake structures of the rectangular cylinder opening the possibility of strong reynolds number effect zhong et al 2019 this free surface flow has been studied by some scholars malavasi and guadagnini 2003 2007 experimentally studied the interaction between the free surface and a submerged rectangular cylinder with w l 3 0 which is a simplified model of bridge decks under a flooding event malavasi and guadagnini 2007 found that when the water depth 7 0l is fixed the drag coefficient increases as the depth decreases from 4 5l to 0 while the lift coefficient roughly levels from d 4 5l to d 1 5l and decreases from d 1 5l to d 0 liu et al 2016 numerically investigated the flow past a plate with w l 0 1 close to a free surface in efforts to identify the optimum depth of hydrokinetic turbines for river applications where the power extraction is maximum they reported that the drag coefficient of the plate decreases as the depth decreases and a dramatic decrease in drag occurs between the depths of 0 6l and 0 5l the disagreement between the force variations with depth in malavasi and guadagnini 2007 and liu et al 2016 was explained as the difference in w l by zhong et al 2019 they conducted a comparison between rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 1 0 and 3 0 placed at various depths in a steady flow and observed distinct variations of the force coefficients with depth at the two w l values later a broad range of w l 0 7 5 0 was considered by zhong et al 2020 in their numerical investigations through which general conclusions on the force behaviors under varying depth were drawn zhong et al 2020 also observed that when the rectangular cylinder approaches the free surface the anti symmetric vortex shedding shown at deep depths becomes asymmetric at moderate depths and suppressed at shallow depths and the features of the asymmetric flow exhibit three patterns depending on w l separated 0 7 w l 1 5 one sidedly reattached 1 5 w l 2 8 and asymmetrically reattached 2 8 w l 5 0 the dramatic change of the flow with depth especially the suppression of vortex shedding reported in zhong et al 2020 is similar to that in liu et al 2016 but the formation of surface jet along with the highly distorted free surface shown in liu et al 2016 is not displayed in zhong et al 2020 this may be attributed to the difference in re i e 5 0 104 and 2 5 104 in liu et al 2016 and zhong et al 2020 respectively malavasi and guadagnini 2007 pointed out that for a submerged rectangular cylinder the presence of the free surface causes strong dependence of the surface distortion and wake on re 1 2 104 3 7 104 in specific significant reynolds number effect on the force coefficients when d l is lower than 3 0 and a positive relationship between the vortex shedding frequency and re were observed malavasi and guadagnini 2007 till now a specialized study of the reynolds number effect on the flow past rectangular cylinders close to a free surface is still lacking to the authors knowledge the experimental research by malavasi and guadagnini 2007 was the first one to indicate the strong reynolds number effect in this free surface flow later chu et al 2016 numerically studied the same flow as malavasi and guadagnini 2007 but reported that re is not the most influential factor while the froude number fr u gl 0 5 where g is the acceleration due to gravity is essential for the hydrodynamic loading however only two re values i e 6 0 104 and 1 9 106 were considered in chu et al 2016 and the comparison was made between two model scales for the counterpart of the present flow the influence of re in the scenario of a rectangular cylinder placed in proximity to a wall has been investigated cigada et al 2006 experimentally studied the effect of wall proximity on the flow past a rectangular cylinder with w l 3 0 over the re range from 6 0 103 to 4 0 104 the results in cigada et al 2006 showed a noticeable influence of re on the force coefficients it is recognized that the flow in the presence of a plane wall and a free surface is distinct which can be described by two factors one is the difference between the formation of boundary layer at the no slip wall and surface jet at the deformable free surface and the other is the distorted evolution associated with a free surface causing complexities in the interaction between the free surface and the vortex shedding sheridan et al 1997 experimentally studied the flow around a circular cylinder close to a free surface and observed that the surface jet forms at certain combinations of d l and fr and exhibits three metastable states a attachment to the free surface b attachment to the cylinder and c an intermediate state in between the same flow was simulated by reichl et al 2005 who focused more on physical parameters such as force shedding frequency etc they found that the surface jet emerges owing to the high local fr which results from the combined effects of the locally increased velocity and the lowered water surface reichl et al 2005 also deduced that the suppression of vortex shedding accompanying the surface jet is because of the surface vortices which enter the wake and cross annihilate with the wake vorticity more complicated factors come into play when the air is trapped by the highly distorted free surface these flow phenomena collaborate to necessitate the study of the reynolds number effect on the flow past a rectangular cylinder in the presence of a free surface the aim of the present study is to explore the effect of re on the flow past a rectangular cylinder near a free surface in order to do that numerical simulations are conducted using computational fluid dynamics cfd which can provide unlimited details of the flow field despite its high computational demands the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans formulation based on statistical models is adopted to track the air water interface the volume of fluid vof model hirt and nichols 1981 which is implemented by adding an extra transport equation of the volume fraction to the rans modeling is employed applicability of the multiphase model has been validated previously in zhong et al 2019 2020 the case of the rectangular cylinder with w l 1 0 is focused in the study four depth to length ratios d l where d is the distance between the undisturbed free surface and the top of the square i e 0 3 0 7 1 0 and 4 5 are considered note that while systematic studies on the effects of w l and d l have been conducted in previous papers of the authors zhong et al 2019 2020 this study regarded as an extension to the previous two focuses on the influence of re thus only one geometric case and four typical d l values are considered the deep depth cases d l 4 5 are used to confirm the insignificant reynolds number effect when the free surface interference is absent and are also used as the reference for the shallow and moderate depth cases a range of re from 2 0 104 to 9 9 104 are considered the strong reynolds number effect is demonstrated by analyses on the global quantities and flow structures results from this study reveal that the reynolds number effect is significant for the submerged square in terms of forces streamlines free surface distortions and vortex dynamics moreover the linkage between the formation of surface jet and the local fr the characteristics of the local fr variation and the mechanism of the suppression of vortex shedding specific for the present flow are discussed the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the flow problem and computational configuration are described in the next section the governing equations and numerical methods are given in section 3 the simulation results regarding the effect of re are presented in section 4 then in section 5 dedicated discussions on the surface jet the local fr and the suppression of vortex shedding are provided finally the conclusions are made in section 6 2 problem description two dimensional multiphase simulations of the flow past a square beneath a free surface are conducted the schematic of the computational domain and the coordinate system is shown in fig 1 as seen the coordinate system is fixed at the center of the square with the x axis aligned with the inlet flow direction the inlet is 20l upstream of the square and the outlet is 50l downstream of the square the distance between the square and the outlet is believed to be sufficiently large that the outlet effects on the wake are negligible liu et al 2016 sohankar 2006 sohankar et al 1999 the computational domain is composed of air on the top and water at the bottom the top boundary is 10l above the undisturbed surface and the bottom is 10l below the square center the square is placed under the free surface the distance between the undisturbed surface and the top of the square denoted by d has a significant impact on the flow and force details of the sizes of the square together with other parameters used in the simulations are given in table 1 the boundary conditions are also depicted in fig 1 as seen the lower left boundary of the computational domain is the inlet where a uniform velocity u 1 u is assumed throughout the simulation and a zero normal gradient pressure is imposed the volume fraction at the inlet is set to 1 and the turbulence parameters k and ω are initialized based on the following equations 1 k 1 5 u i 2 2 ω k 0 5 c μ 0 25 l where i 5 is the turbulence intensity and l 0 07l is the turbulence length the empirical constant c μ is 0 09 the lower right boundary is the outlet where zero normal gradient conditions are applied to all variables the atmosphere includes the top the upper left and upper right boundaries of the domain a constant total pressure p 0 is used at the atmosphere which prescribes that the pressure adjusts according to the velocity as p rgh p 0 0 5ρ u 2 the surface of the square and the bottom boundary are modeled as walls to which no flux and no slip conditions and zero normal gradient pressure are specified in order to reduce the computing time wall functions are used in the near wall regions as required the first internal grid points are placed in the inertial layer 11 06 y 200 00 where the empirical relations apply moukalled et al 2015 due to the simple flow configuration the cartesian grid is used as shown in fig 2 the mesh orthogonality favors the computations by avoiding correction loops for the calculation of gradients moukalled et al 2015 non uniform mesh distributions are intentionally achieved with which the free surface evolution and vortex dynamics near the square can be captured at reasonably reduced computational cost a small mesh size near the square is chosen δx 1 40l this small mesh size is used in the region between 0 5l upstream and 3 0l downstream of the square see fig 2 b and increases toward the inlet or outlet with a low ratio see fig 2 a the grid convergence study for the cases with re 2 5 104 shows small changes of the force coefficients when the ratio varies among 1 025 1 03 and 1 04 as available in zhong et al 2019 the cases with re 9 9 104 are simulated in the present convergence study the results of which are provided in table 2 as shown in the table the relative changes of the force coefficients when the ratio varies among 1 025 1 03 and 1 04 are mostly within 1 0 in this study medium mesh densities i e the ratio in the longitudinal direction is equal to 1 03 or 1 1 03 are used as the basis for the mesh generations the timestep δt is set as 0 001 for the cases with re 9 9 104 and is reduced to 0 0005 for the cases with re 9 9 104 following the cfl rule which suggests uδt δx 1 0 throughout the simulations the cfl number is mostly lower than 0 5 as stated in zhong et al 2019 for the cases with re 2 5 104 the flow takes a longer time to reach the stable status at low d l than at high d l in specific the flow becomes stable after 300s when d l 1 0 while the stable flow emerges after 200s when d l 1 0 the same situations apply to the cases with other re values considered in this study nevertheless it is found that when re rises to a high value the required time for the stable flow formation reduces notably in order to simplify the simulation setup and data processing all the simulation time durations obey the rule in zhong et al 2019 the drag and lift coefficients as functions of time when re is 9 9 104 are plotted in fig 3 moreover the distance of the first internal grid point to the wall is selected as 0 025 l at the square surface and 0 050 l at the bottom respectively the temporally and spatially averaged y over the square surface for the cases with re 9 9 104 are between 11 06 and 100 00 as shown in table 2 indicating that the first internal grid points are positioned in the logarithmic layer 3 numerical simulations 3 1 governing equations computation of free surface flows involves modeling two immiscible fluids i e water and air in the simulations the vof model hirt and nichols 1981 is adopted to capture the surface evolution one notable advantage inherent in the model s surface capturing is the static mesh allowance which makes this method popular among cfd practitioners and engineers bruinsma et al 2018 higuera et al 2013 hu et al 2016 martínez ferrer et al 2018 the surface capturing in vof hirt and nichols 1981 is realized through the volume fraction which varies from 0 to 1 according to the percentage of one fluid in the cell volume a water cell is marked with α 1 an air cell is marked with α 0 and the air water interface is presented where 0 α 1 the advection equation of the volume fraction is given as 3 α t u α u c α 1 α 0 where u c is the artifical compressive velocity and is calculated by equation 4 the factor c a in equation 4 usually takes 1 the last term on the left hand side of equation 3 acts as a source of artificial compression for the convection of volume faction helping maintain the sharpness of air water interface and the boundedness of α between 0 and 1 this term is active only in the interface region and vanishes at both limits of α for further reference see rusche 2003 with the introduction of volume fraction the fluid properties at each cell are evaluated in the form φ αφ water 1 α φ air for example the fluid density is calculated as ρ αρ water 1 α ρ air 4 u cf α α min c α u f max u f the incompressible flow continuity and navier stokes n s equations are averaged over time to derive the reynolds averaged equations for the conservation of mass and momentum of the fluid as follows 5 u 0 6 ρ u t ρ uu p r g h g x ρ μ μ t u u μ μ t σ α α α where u denotes the mean velocity and p rgh is the modified pressure defined as p rgh p ρ g x the last term on the right hand side of equation 6 is the pressure gradient caused by the surface tension at the air water interface the time averaging process leads to the reynolds stress terms in the momentum equations bringing the benefits of using statistical analyses to account for turbulence effects although the accuracy of rans relies on the statistical models its favorable performance in industrial applications is acknowledged by the cfd community mannini et al 2010 ong et al 2009 stringer et al 2014 tian et al 2013 the unknown reynolds stress terms in equation 6 are approximated with boussinesq equation which is a basic equation for eddy viscosity models that transforms the calculation of reynolds stresses to the computation of turbulent eddy viscosity μ t the mentor sst k ω model menter 1994 is adopted to compute the turbulent eddy viscosity the turbulent eddy viscosity is obtained by solving two additional equations i e the transport equations of the turbulent kinetic energy k and the specific turbulence dissipation ω 7 ρ k t ρ u k μ μ t σ k k p k 0 09 ρ k ω 8 ρ ω t ρ u ω μ μ t σ ω ω c α ω k p k c β ρ ω 2 2 1 f 1 σ ω 2 ρ ω k ω 9 μ t 0 31 ρ k max 0 31 ω 2 s r f 2 where p k is the production of turbulent kinetic energy and s r is the magnitude of strain rate the constants in equations 7 and 8 depend on the blending function f 1 in the form φ f 1 φ 1 1 f 1 φ 2 where φ 1 and φ 2 are the corresponding constants in the original k ω and k ε models respectively the constants of the original models are assigned the following values c α1 0 5532 c β1 0 075 σ k1 2 00 σ ω1 2 00 c α2 0 4403 c β2 0 0828 σ k2 1 00 and σ ω2 1 186 the turbulent eddy viscosity is computed by equation 9 which is favorable as it guarantees that bradshow s assumption is satisfied moukalled et al 2015 3 2 numerical methods the continuity and reynolds averaged n s equations the transport equation of the volume fraction and the turbulence model equations are discretized using the finite volume method fvm performed in the open source package openfoam openfoam is a bundle of c libraries designed to solve problems like fluid flows combustions electromagnetics chemical reactions etc the fvm is implemented by integrating each term in the equations over a control volume and relating the volume integrals to the surface integrals using gauss s theorem the surface and volume integrals are both evaluated with the mid point integration approximation which yields second order accuracy the convective and diffusive fluxes at cell faces are evaluated with the second order upwind sou and central differencing cd schemes respectively the second order crank nicolson cn scheme is used for the time integration the interfoam solver in openfoam is adopted interfoam is capable of simulating two phase flows using the fvm discretization and the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 a flow chart regarding the solver was given in higuera et al 2013 interfoam employs the pimple algorithm to treat the pressure velocity coupling the principal of the algorithm is as follows within each time step both the outer and inner loops are executed in the outer loop the momentum and pressure correction equations are solved sequentially in an implicit manner while in the inner loop the momentum and pressure correction equations are explicitly established and solved the calculations are repeated until convergence is achieved in the present simulations three outer loops and nine inner loops are executed within each time step the solutions are regarded as being converged when the residuals of the velocity and pressure are lower than 1e 06 4 simulation results 4 1 global quantities the results from the present study are compared to those in luo et al 1994 norberg 1993 okajima 1982 saha et al 2000 sohankar 2006 and vickery 1966 as shown in fig 4 it is seen that when the square is placed at d l 4 5 where the free surface interference is weak the predicted force coefficients are in good agreement with the published data over a broad range of re thus it confirms that the present multiphase simulations can provide reliable predictions for the free surface flow note that a detailed validation of the present multiphase model for the simulation of rectangular cylinders near a free surface is referred to zhong et al 2019 2020 fig 4 also indicates that when d l is 4 5 the influence of re on the force coefficients is small this is consistent with the discussion by sohankar 2006 who reported that when re is in the range from 3 0 103 to 5 0 106 the reynolds number effect on the forces and wakes of a square is small sohankar 2006 registered that the insensitiveness of the flow to re is due to the fixed flow separation at the upstream corners of the square which undermines the role of laminar to turbulent transition in the boundary layer nevertheless for a reattached flow although the flow separation is spatially restricted the reattachment of the flow provides the basis of strong reynolds number effect mannini et al 2010 and schewe 2013 demonstrated that when the rectangular cylinder with w l 5 0 is inclined with respect to an incoming flow the symmetry of the flow is broken and as a result the separation bubbles on the upper and lower sides of the cylinder differ from each other specifically the separation bubble on the side which the rectangular cylinder is inclined toward expands or disappears while the separation bubble on the other side shrinks the differences in the shape and curvature of the bubbles lead to the dependence of the flow on re for the present study the flow symmetry is altered when an asymmetric boundary i e the free surface is included zhong et al 2020 observed that when a square cylinder approaches a free surface the separated vortex shedding becomes asymmetric at 0 6 d l 1 0 and suppressed at 0 3 d l 0 5 the asymmetry or suppression of the flow brings about the strong reynolds number effect on the wakes and consequently the forces as pointed out by malavasi and guadagnini 2003 through experiments of the flow past a submerged rectangular cylinder with w l 3 0 over the re range from 1 2 104 to 3 7 104 fig 4 shows that when d l is 0 3 0 7 or 1 0 the force coefficients vary significantly with re note that the selected d l values i e d l 0 7 1 0 and d l 0 3 respectively locate within the two ranges where the vortex shedding is asymmetrically separated and suppressed zhong et al 2020 despite the complex variations of the curves in fig 4 some characteristics of the relation between the force coefficients and re are observed the curves denoting the drag coefficient c d of the square located at d l 0 7 1 0 fluctuate with re while a constantly rising curve is shown when d l 0 3 see fig 4 a the two variation patterns of c d reflect the difference between the influences of the free surface on the separated and suppressed vortex shedding and vice versa this conception is confirmed by fig 4 d which shows notable fluctuations of st with re at d l 0 7 1 0 and a constantly decreasing st at d l 0 3 the jump in st at re 6 5 104 will be discussed later note that the variations of st with re when d l is 1 0 from the present results are different from those in malavasi and guadagnini 2007 where a positive relationship between st and re over the range of 1 2 104 re 3 7 104 was reported the apparent reason is the difference in w l i e 1 0 in the present study and 3 0 in malavasi and guadagnini 2007 but a comprehensive investigation on this is left for future works fig 4 c corresponding to the r m s value of lift coefficient c l further manifests the two patterns of variations at d l 0 7 1 0 and d l 0 3 respectively however the results in fig 4 b show that for both the moderate and shallow depth cases the averaged c l decreases drastically for the majority of re considered in the study it reflects the fact that the square receives larger cross flow downward pushing forces from the free surface at higher re regardless of the flow patterns the influence of the difference in vortex shedding i e asymmetric and suppressed due to the varying proximity to the surface is only disclosed by the r m s value of c l furthermore fig 4 d shows that when d l is 0 3 there exists a sudden jump in the st curve at re 6 5 104 the drastic variation in st implies the change of the suppressed flow which will be explored in the following flow structure sections in fact there exists a small range of re i e 5 0 104 re 6 0 104 where the characteristic vortex shedding frequency is bimodal as shown in fig 4 d 4 2 streamlines the time averaged streamlines over the square at three re values are shown in fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 respectively it is seen that the deep depth cases are characterized by symmetric separation bubbles between the upper and lower half of the flow which are independent of re when comparing figs 5 c 6 c and 7 c this is in accordance with the force variations with re see fig 4 besides the streamlines in the three figures are similar to those for re 2 2 104 in sohankar 2006 where three dimensional single phase large eddy simulations les were conducted re dependent streamlines display when the square is in moderate or high closeness to the free surface the re dependence results from the surface induced modifications to the vortex shedding fig 5 a and b illustrate two streamline patterns of the square located at d l 0 3 and d l 0 7 when re is 2 5 104 in specific when d l is 0 7 the bubble above the square is compressed while the bubble under the square is expanded see fig 5 b the flow asymmetry is more evident in the wake where the upper bubble increases in size crossing the centerline of the square however although the flow is skewed due to the free surface proximity the periodic vortex shedding is retained the flow pattern is thus described as asymmetrically separated by zhong et al 2020 when d l is 0 3 the vortex shedding is suppressed see fig 5 a instead of periodic vortex shedding two large scale counter rotating vortices form behind the square occupying the major portion of the near wake the flow time series reveal that the two counter rotating vortices maintain their presence throughout while the strengths of the vortices rise and fall periodically leading to the periodicity of the flow which is notably lower than that of vortex shedding flows the two flow patterns displayed depending on the proximity to the free surface exhibit different variations with re fig 6 a and b show that as re rises to 5 0 104 the suppressed flow varies in a way that the sizes of the counter rotating vortices increase while the asymmetrically separated flow is manifested with enhanced asymmetry a different streamline pattern emerges when re is high as shown in fig 7 a and b when re is 9 9 104 the flow is remarkably skewed at both d l values accompanying the drastic surface evolution the resultant flow signifies the influence of surface jet and vortex interaction in the wake which will be presented later moreover fig 7 a indicates that with the formation of surface jet which enters and interacts with the wake the periodic vortex shedding is retained this is reflected by the jump in st when re is higher than 6 5 104 as shown in fig 4 d 4 3 free surface evolution and vortex dynamics the free surface is captured with the volume fraction α as aforementioned the air water interface is displayed where α is between 0 and 1 in fig 8 fig 9 the interface is depicted by three values of α i e 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 the vorticity around the square is also shown in figs 8 9 to present the wakes beneath the distorted free surface the vorticity component in the x 2 direction is defined as 10 ω 2 u 1 x 3 u 3 x 1 fig 8 shows the instantaneous free surface and vorticity around the square located at d l 0 7 with four re strong reynolds number effect on the flow is clearly demonstrated it is seen in fig 8 b that the positive vortices above the square are pressed at re 2 5 104 causing the asymmetry of the flow on the other side the free surface varies slightly with several small negative vortices sparsely distributed at the surface in fact the surface evolves notably during each cycle of vortex shedding following the regression and progression of shear layers and a description of this is available in zhong et al 2020 the small vortices at the free surface are restricted by diffusion from entering the wake while no extra contributions to facilitate the vertical motion of the vortices are received from the slightly curving surface when re rises to 5 0 104 the free surface distortion enhances showing a sign of overturning see fig 8 c fig 8 d indicates that the vortices at the surface increase in strength and start to interact with the shear layers from the square as re further increases the vortex interaction between the free surface and the square is evident fig 8 e shows that the free surface rises in front of the square but drops noticeably behind the square a distinct overturning surface is formed facilitated by the curved free surface the negative vortices from the surface move effectively downward and enter and interact with the wake due to the vorticity layer from the surface the vortex shedding becomes more skewed which matches the decrease of the averaged c l in fig 4 b the interaction of vortices becomes stronger when re rises to 9 9 104 fig 8 g shows that with the drastic surface evolution a large quantity of air is trapped in the wake and participates in the vortex interaction the transport of vorticity layer from the surface is dramatic as shown in fig 8 h resembling the surface jet in liu et al 2016 for a thin plate in the vicinity of a free surface and reichl et al 2005 for a shallowly submerged circular cylinder due to the surface jet two flow regions in the wake are identified with the upper right region occupied by the vorticity layer from the free surface and the lower left region occupied by the shear layers from the square the vortex interaction mainly appears along the slanting line area between the two flow regions the free surface evolution and vorticity of the square located at d l 0 3 is shown in fig 9 different variation process of the flow with re from the cases with d l 0 7 is observed fig 9 b shows that when re is 2 5 104 the positive vortices above the square are significantly pressed and flow in parallel with the free surface while the negative vortices produced at the lower corner of the leading edge are shed downward from the lower surface the vortex shedding is suppressed but the vortices are greatly lengthened the concept by reichl et al 2005 who stated a close relation of the suppressed vortex shedding to the reduced fluxes of vorticity fed into shear layers when d l decreases applies to the situation here analyses on the suppression of vortex shedding in section 5 2 will provide more insights into this fig 9 a shows that the free surface on top of the square fluctuates with the shape of the fluctuations resembling waves as re increases the free surface in front of the square rises but drops when passing the square causing fluctuations of the upper shear layer from the square see fig 9 c d although the strengths of the vortices increase due to the increased re the vortex interaction appears to occur far downstream where the positive vortices from the square approach the free surface the tendency of the upper shear layer shed from the square to move toward the surface is analogous to one of the metastable behaviors of the flow past a circular cylinder close to a free surface i e attachment to the free surface sheridan et al 1997 the vorticity layer from the surface or surface jet is evident when re is 7 4 104 and 9 9 104 fig 9 f and h show that the cross annihilation between the vortices from the surface and the square are more intense than that when d l is 0 7 see fig 8 h importantly the regular vortex shedding recovers from being suppressed with the help of the surface jet interference which is reflected by the sharp rise of st when re 6 5 104 as shown in fig 4 d this disagrees with the positive relation between the surface jet and the cessation of vortex shedding reported in reichl et al 2005 and arouses the authors interests in examining the mechanism of the suppression of vortex shedding discussions on this will be presented in section 5 2 it is worth noting that at the depth of 4 5l no surface jet develops even when re rises to 9 9 104 the formation of surface jet is considered to associate with the local froude number fr u 1 gd local 0 5 where u 1 represents the streamwise velocity in the area between the free surface and the square and d local is the instantaneous distance between the evolving surface and the upper surface of the square as will be presented for a shallowly or moderately submerged square the local fr is remarkably larger than the global fr and rises rapidly as re increases when the local fr is close to or higher than 1 0 the surface distortion increases drastically facilitating the transport of vortices from the free surface to the wake and thus the surface jet forms reichl et al 2005 5 discussions on flow features 5 1 surface jet and local froude number there are two processes involved when re increases as indicated by the analyses on the flow structure one is the surface jet and the other is the vortex interaction between the vorticity layer from the surface and the shear layers from the square note that the surface jet and the vortex interaction are not absolutely corresponding in terms of formation as shown in figss 8 9 but certainly the latter is a consequence of the former the formation of surface jet which is linked to the local fr is of interests in the present research it should be clear that the vortices at the surface with the strength equal to twice the local angular velocity multiplied by the local curvature lugt 1987 rood 1995 form as a result of the surface distortion but the surface jet establishes only when the vorticity layer accumulates in strength along with the increment of the surface curvature the surface jet is thus seen as the enhanced form of the vorticity layer at the surface although the separation of these two states is not straightforward as observed from the flow visualization the local fr provides a quantitative way to distinguish the states fig 10 shows the instantaneous maximum local fr in the area between the free surface and the upper surface of the square the local fr is sampled at eleven x positions equally spaced along the width of the square the instantaneous distance between the evolving surface and the square at each x position is used to obtain an accurate prediction the instants correspond to the time when the lift is minimum which are the same as those in figs 8 9 note that the main features of the local fr variation are well revealed by this instant since when the lift is maximum with the regression of the upper shear layer the free surface lowers resulting in a larger local fr the pre formation and formation of surface jet are plotted with dashed and solid lines in fig 10 respectively the absence of surface jet under deep depth condition is properly reflected by fig 10 d as the local fr of the deep depth cases remains lower than 1 0 over the whole re range for the shallow and moderate depths the local fr approaches or exceeds 1 0 when re is high fig 10 a shows that at d l 0 3 the local fr exceeds 1 0 when re is higher than 3 0 104 which corresponds to the formation of surface jet it is also seen that the local fr at the trailing corner position x l 0 5 is evidently higher than that at the leading corner position x l 0 5 this is due to the fact that as re increases the evolving surface reaches an elevated position upstream of the square but drops when passing across the square see fig 9 c e and g causing a higher local fr at near the trailing edge besides the variations of the local fr along the width of the square shown in fig 10 a exhibit a change when re is higher than 6 5 104 this re value relates to the development of vortex interaction in the wake and the restoration of regular vortex shedding similar to that in fig 9 f and h and also corresponds to the st jump in fig 4 d fig 10 b and c show that when d l is 0 7 and 1 0 the local fr rises gradually with re the critical re values for the formation of surface jet when d l is 0 7 and 1 0 are 4 0 104 and 4 5 104 respectively a reasonable conclusion is drawn that the critical re for the formation of surface jet increases with d l but when d l is sufficiently large achieving the deep depth condition the surface jet will not be developed whatever re values see fig 10 d furthermore there exists two important phenomena of the local fr first the present flow configuration is analogous to the open channel flow across a broad crested weir as documented in munson et al 2009 the flow passing over the weir block accelerates and reaches the critical condition fr 1 0 but does not accelerate to the supercritical condition fr 1 0 the flow remains critical over the weir block however fig 10 a c show that when the surface jet is formed the local fr transits from subcritical to nearly critical conditions and remains for a while before continuing rising to the supercritical condition along the width of the square note that the theoretical interpretation in munson et al 2009 is based on steady laminar flow assumptions for the present flow as shown in both figs 8 and 9 complex phenomena such as vortices from the surface and the square and the interaction between them contribute to the unbounded increase of the local fr second fig 10 a shows that the formation of surface jet is accompanied with the local fr larger than 1 0 at d l 0 3 while fig 10 b and c indicate that at d l 7 0 and d l 1 0 even when the local fr is lower than 1 0 the surface jet is formed together with the highly distorted surface this is because the skewed vortex shedding shown at moderate depths see fig 8 c d causes the rising and falling of the proximal free surface aiding the formation of surface jet 5 2 the suppression of vortex shedding from a general perspective there have been extensive studies on the suppression of vortex shedding due to the fact that vortex shedding phenomena can lead to unsteady forces on objects which is a source of vortex induced vibration viv and thus the failure of structures there are at present various methods to control vortex shedding e g introducing external objects in one of the shear layers imposing self oscillation on the objects modifying surface roughness and utilizing electric magnetic or thermal effects rashidi et al 2016 related to the present study is the flow over cylinders close to a plane wall or a free surface the explanation to the cessation of vortex shedding in the scenario of a circular cylinder near a plane boundary as stated in lei et al 2000 is the cancellation of the lower shear layer by the opposite signed vorticity of the wall shear layer preventing the interaction between the upper and lower shear layers for the case of approaching a free surface a similar conclusion was drawn by reichl et al 2005 who reported that the jet like flow around the submerged circular cylinder forms as the result of the reduced fluxes of vorticity fed into the upper shear layer following a quadratic dependence on the reduced velocity reichl et al 2005 also observed that when the vortex shedding ceases an extremely long quasi steady recirculation zone emerges at the rear of the cylinder which is the same for the present square case as shown in figs 5 a and fig 6 a however the difference between circular and square cylinders is obvious while the curvedness of a circular cylinder allows the free shift of shear layers over the structural surface the sharp cornered square restrains the separation position and shedding direction of shear layers wang and tan 2008 found that due to a straightened effect of shear layers the wake spreading and momentum exchange of square cylinders are lower than those of circular cylinders at the same gap above a plane wall thus it is anticipated that the suppression of vortex shedding for a square near a free surface may be contributed by factors other than just the reduction in vorticity fluxes in order to quantitatively demonstrate the relative strength between the upper and lower shear layers the vorticity fluxes calculated using equation 11 are employed this approach has been utilized by sheridan et al 1997 to describe the coupling between the upper shear layer from a circular cylinder and the vorticity layer from the free surface in forming a jet for the quasi parallel jet in sheridan et al 1997 the equality between f and f is satisfied at any section of the jet but in the present study the imbalance between vorticity fluxes is sought 11 f 0 u 1 ω 2 d y a n d f 0 u 1 ω 2 d y fig 11 and fig 12 show the time averaged vorticity fluxes at four x positions of the square located at d l 0 3 when re is 2 5 104 and 9 9 104 respectively the two cases represent the suppression and restoration of vortex shedding corresponding to fig 9 b and h respectively it is seen in fig 11 that when the vortex shedding is suppressed the vorticity fluxes in the upper shear layer are roughly comparable to those in the lower shear layer as indicated by the relative vorticity fluxes at positions a to d with values of 1 264 0 876 0 832 and 0 688 respectively fig 12 corresponding to the restored vortex shedding indicates that although the vorticity fluxes in the upper shear layer are notably lower than those in the lower shear layer at position a the relative vorticity fluxes at position b where the vortex interaction takes place is close to one by comparing fig 11 with fig 12 it is found that the cessation of vortex shedding is not only contributed by the modifications of vorticity fluxes in the shear layers due to the free surface interference but also more profoundly affected by the alterations of shedding directions of the shear layers the positions of peak vorticity fluxes in fig 11 imply that the upper shear layer flows nearly in parallel with the free surface while the lower shear layer moves downward leading to a gap between the two shear layers the restrained shedding direction of the upper shear layer mainly results from the presence of the upper corner of the trailing edge which prevents the shear layer from flowing downward as that of a circular cylinder reichl et al 2005 the restoration of vortex shedding at high re is aided by the skewed surface jet see fig 9 h which forces the recontact of the upper and lower shear layers to couple with each other forming the periodic vortex shedding note that positions c and d in fig 12 locate in the upper right wake region isolated by the surface jet where the upper shear layer is absent as shown in fig 9 h the characteristics of vorticity fluxes when anti symmetric vortex shedding displays are illustrated by fig 13 as shown in fig 13 nearly equal vorticity fluxes between the upper and lower shear layers are observed and close contact of the shear layers is also reflected therefore a reasonable explanation to the suppression of vortex shedding for the present flow is the detachment of shear layers caused by the sharp corners of the square combined with the modifications of vorticity fluxes due to the presence of a free surface the influence of re on restoring the vortex shedding functions with the formation of surface jet which promotes the recontact of the shear layers across the sharp corners 6 conclusions the reynolds number effect on the flow past a square cylinder close to a free surface was investigated in the present study two dimensional rans simulations with the mentor sst k ω model were conducted to reveal the flow properties the vof model was adopted in the multiphase simulations to track the free surface evolution the influence of re ranging from 2 0 104 to 9 9 104 on the global quantities and flow structures was analyzed as a reference case the square located at a deep depth i e d l 4 5 was simulated to demonstrate the small influence of re on the flow which is consistent with the published data for the shallow d l 0 3 and moderate d l 0 7 and d l 1 0 depths significant reynolds number effect was observed the main conclusions are summarized in the following 1 the force coefficients of a shallowly or moderately submerged square vary significantly with re different variation patterns of c d r m s value of c l and st with re at the two depth ranges were observed for the averaged c l a falling trend with re was observed for both the shallow and moderate depth cases moreover a sudden jump in st appears at re 6 5 104 for the cases with d l 0 3 2 the streamlines of the deep depth cases are characterized by symmetric separation bubbles about the centerline of the square which exhibit negligible dependence on re for the moderate depth cases the separation bubbles around the square are asymmetric which enhance in asymmetry as re increases for the shallow depth cases with the cessation of vortex shedding large scale counter rotating vortices emerge in the near wake the streamlines of both the shallow and moderate depth cases display a similar pattern at high re which correspond to the vortex interaction between the free surface and the square 3 the influence of re on the vortex dynamics of the square is intertwined with the rising surface distortion with re at both the shallow and moderate depths negative vortices form at the surface which accumulate in strength together with the increment in surface curvature as re increases and reach the state of surface jet when re is larger than a critical value for the deep depth cases no surface jet develops 4 the critical re values for the formation of surface jet at the 3 d l values i e 0 3 0 7 and 1 0 are 3 0 104 4 0 104 and 4 5 104 respectively moreover the occurrence of supercritical flow in the area between the free surface and the square indicates the significance of the complex flow phenomena such as surface jet vortex formation and shedding and vortex interaction the formation of surface jet at the local fr lower than 1 0 for the moderate depth cases is aided by the falling and rising of the free surface following the regression and progression of shear layers 5 the suppression of vortex shedding for the square located at d l 0 3 is more closely related to the detachment of shear layers caused by the sharp corners of the square than the modifications of vorticity fluxes by the free surface interference the restoration of vortex shedding at high re is due to the surface jet interference which forces the recontact of the upper and lower shear layers to couple with each other forming the periodic vortex shedding credit authorship contribution statement wenjie zhong conceptualization methodology software validation writing original draft visualization

21464,rectangular cylinders are insensitive to the reynolds number re due to the geometrically restricted flow separation the introduction of asymmetry e g inclination asymmetric cross section and asymmetric boundary in the flow can signify the role of re to date the effect of re on rectangular cylinders near a free surface has not been comprehensively investigated in this study multiphase simulations of a square located at four depth to length ratios 0 3 0 7 1 0 and 4 5 over the re range from 2 0 104 to 9 9 104 were conducted strong reynolds number effect on the flow was observed at the shallow and moderate depths the surface jet forming as the result of surface curvature when re increases is related to the local froude number fr the critical re values for the surface jet formation at the three depth to length ratios i e 0 3 0 7 and 1 0 are 3 0 104 4 0 104 and 4 5 104 respectively the suppression of vortex shedding at the shallow depths is explained as the detachment of shear layers together with the modifications of vorticity fluxes the restoration of vortex shedding when re is high is due to the surface jet interference which forces the recontact of the shear

and ishihara 2002 sohankar 2006 the wide applications of this flow contain but are not limited to the field of civil engineering e g buildings towers and bridges the field of mechanical engineering e g turbines and heat exchangers and the field of ocean engineering e g offshore platforms risers and pipes from the fluid mechanics point of view the flow over a rectangular cylinder involves plenty of physical phenomena e g flow separation and reattachment vortex formation and shedding and unsteady wake a prominent feature in this type of flow is the fixed point of flow separation at sharp corners which is quite a contrast to the flow past a circular cylinder while the curved surface of circular cylinders permits the shift of separation position or laminar to turbulent transition relying on the reynolds number re ud ν where d is the characteristic length bloor 1964 catalano et al 2003 norberg 2003 williamson 1996 yokuda and ramaprian 1990 the geometrically fixed flow separation of rectangular cylinders renders the influence of re insignificant especially when re is greater than 2 0 104 franke et al 1990 norberg 1993 sohankar 2006 sohankar et al 1999 note that the significant reynolds number effect on the rectangular cylinder flow at low to moderate re e g 70 re 2 0 104 is associated with the flow transition from laminar to turbulent as observed by okajima 1982 which is outside the scope of the present study one way to make the influence of re significant in the moderate to high range is to incorporate asymmetry in the flow configuration mannini et al 2010 found that when the rectangular cylinder with a width to length ratio w l where w and l are the width and length of the rectangular cylinder respectively of 5 0 is inclined at an angle of α 4 the flow features change significantly and the lift coefficient rises as re increases from 2 6 104 to 1 9 106 schewe 2013 experimentally studied the same flow but at several angles of attack over a range of re from 4 0 103 to 6 0 105 and reported similar phenomena of strong reynolds number effect as mannini et al 2010 schewe 2013 also found that the influence of re on the rectangular cylinder with a small w l 0 2 is small due to the lack of flow reattachment moreover when the cross section of a cylinder is asymmetric e g a trapezoidal shaped bridge section the strong effect of re is also exhibited larose and d auteuil 2006 schewe 2001 apart from using geometric modification to gain asymmetric property in the flow another way of achieving that is through introducing an asymmetric boundary condition the problem of concern in this study is the flow past a rectangular cylinder near a free surface the presence of a free surface has a significant influence on the vortex shedding and wake structures of the rectangular cylinder opening the possibility of strong reynolds number effect zhong et al 2019 this free surface flow has been studied by some scholars malavasi and guadagnini 2003 2007 experimentally studied the interaction between the free surface and a submerged rectangular cylinder with w l 3 0 which is a simplified model of bridge decks under a flooding event malavasi and guadagnini 2007 found that when the water depth 7 0l is fixed the drag coefficient increases as the depth decreases from 4 5l to 0 while the lift coefficient roughly levels from d 4 5l to d 1 5l and decreases from d 1 5l to d 0 liu et al 2016 numerically investigated the flow past a plate with w l 0 1 close to a free surface in efforts to identify the optimum depth of hydrokinetic turbines for river applications where the power extraction is maximum they reported that the drag coefficient of the plate decreases as the depth decreases and a dramatic decrease in drag occurs between the depths of 0 6l and 0 5l the disagreement between the force variations with depth in malavasi and guadagnini 2007 and liu et al 2016 was explained as the difference in w l by zhong et al 2019 they conducted a comparison between rectangular cylinders with w l equal to 1 0 and 3 0 placed at various depths in a steady flow and observed distinct variations of the force coefficients with depth at the two w l values later a broad range of w l 0 7 5 0 was considered by zhong et al 2020 in their numerical investigations through which general conclusions on the force behaviors under varying depth were drawn zhong et al 2020 also observed that when the rectangular cylinder approaches the free surface the anti symmetric vortex shedding shown at deep depths becomes asymmetric at moderate depths and suppressed at shallow depths and the features of the asymmetric flow exhibit three patterns depending on w l separated 0 7 w l 1 5 one sidedly reattached 1 5 w l 2 8 and asymmetrically reattached 2 8 w l 5 0 the dramatic change of the flow with depth especially the suppression of vortex shedding reported in zhong et al 2020 is similar to that in liu et al 2016 but the formation of surface jet along with the highly distorted free surface shown in liu et al 2016 is not displayed in zhong et al 2020 this may be attributed to the difference in re i e 5 0 104 and 2 5 104 in liu et al 2016 and zhong et al 2020 respectively malavasi and guadagnini 2007 pointed out that for a submerged rectangular cylinder the presence of the free surface causes strong dependence of the surface distortion and wake on re 1 2 104 3 7 104 in specific significant reynolds number effect on the force coefficients when d l is lower than 3 0 and a positive relationship between the vortex shedding frequency and re were observed malavasi and guadagnini 2007 till now a specialized study of the reynolds number effect on the flow past rectangular cylinders close to a free surface is still lacking to the authors knowledge the experimental research by malavasi and guadagnini 2007 was the first one to indicate the strong reynolds number effect in this free surface flow later chu et al 2016 numerically studied the same flow as malavasi and guadagnini 2007 but reported that re is not the most influential factor while the froude number fr u gl 0 5 where g is the acceleration due to gravity is essential for the hydrodynamic loading however only two re values i e 6 0 104 and 1 9 106 were considered in chu et al 2016 and the comparison was made between two model scales for the counterpart of the present flow the influence of re in the scenario of a rectangular cylinder placed in proximity to a wall has been investigated cigada et al 2006 experimentally studied the effect of wall proximity on the flow past a rectangular cylinder with w l 3 0 over the re range from 6 0 103 to 4 0 104 the results in cigada et al 2006 showed a noticeable influence of re on the force coefficients it is recognized that the flow in the presence of a plane wall and a free surface is distinct which can be described by two factors one is the difference between the formation of boundary layer at the no slip wall and surface jet at the deformable free surface and the other is the distorted evolution associated with a free surface causing complexities in the interaction between the free surface and the vortex shedding sheridan et al 1997 experimentally studied the flow around a circular cylinder close to a free surface and observed that the surface jet forms at certain combinations of d l and fr and exhibits three metastable states a attachment to the free surface b attachment to the cylinder and c an intermediate state in between the same flow was simulated by reichl et al 2005 who focused more on physical parameters such as force shedding frequency etc they found that the surface jet emerges owing to the high local fr which results from the combined effects of the locally increased velocity and the lowered water surface reichl et al 2005 also deduced that the suppression of vortex shedding accompanying the surface jet is because of the surface vortices which enter the wake and cross annihilate with the wake vorticity more complicated factors come into play when the air is trapped by the highly distorted free surface these flow phenomena collaborate to necessitate the study of the reynolds number effect on the flow past a rectangular cylinder in the presence of a free surface the aim of the present study is to explore the effect of re on the flow past a rectangular cylinder near a free surface in order to do that numerical simulations are conducted using computational fluid dynamics cfd which can provide unlimited details of the flow field despite its high computational demands the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans formulation based on statistical models is adopted to track the air water interface the volume of fluid vof model hirt and nichols 1981 which is implemented by adding an extra transport equation of the volume fraction to the rans modeling is employed applicability of the multiphase model has been validated previously in zhong et al 2019 2020 the case of the rectangular cylinder with w l 1 0 is focused in the study four depth to length ratios d l where d is the distance between the undisturbed free surface and the top of the square i e 0 3 0 7 1 0 and 4 5 are considered note that while systematic studies on the effects of w l and d l have been conducted in previous papers of the authors zhong et al 2019 2020 this study regarded as an extension to the previous two focuses on the influence of re thus only one geometric case and four typical d l values are considered the deep depth cases d l 4 5 are used to confirm the insignificant reynolds number effect when the free surface interference is absent and are also used as the reference for the shallow and moderate depth cases a range of re from 2 0 104 to 9 9 104 are considered the strong reynolds number effect is demonstrated by analyses on the global quantities and flow structures results from this study reveal that the reynolds number effect is significant for the submerged square in terms of forces streamlines free surface distortions and vortex dynamics moreover the linkage between the formation of surface jet and the local fr the characteristics of the local fr variation and the mechanism of the suppression of vortex shedding specific for the present flow are discussed the remainder of the paper is organized as follows the flow problem and computational configuration are described in the next section the governing equations and numerical methods are given in section 3 the simulation results regarding the effect of re are presented in section 4 then in section 5 dedicated discussions on the surface jet the local fr and the suppression of vortex shedding are provided finally the conclusions are made in section 6 2 problem description two dimensional multiphase simulations of the flow past a square beneath a free surface are conducted the schematic of the computational domain and the coordinate system is shown in fig 1 as seen the coordinate system is fixed at the center of the square with the x axis aligned with the inlet flow direction the inlet is 20l upstream of the square and the outlet is 50l downstream of the square the distance between the square and the outlet is believed to be sufficiently large that the outlet effects on the wake are negligible liu et al 2016 sohankar 2006 sohankar et al 1999 the computational domain is composed of air on the top and water at the bottom the top boundary is 10l above the undisturbed surface and the bottom is 10l below the square center the square is placed under the free surface the distance between the undisturbed surface and the top of the square denoted by d has a significant impact on the flow and force details of the sizes of the square together with other parameters used in the simulations are given in table 1 the boundary conditions are also depicted in fig 1 as seen the lower left boundary of the computational domain is the inlet where a uniform velocity u 1 u is assumed throughout the simulation and a zero normal gradient pressure is imposed the volume fraction at the inlet is set to 1 and the turbulence parameters k and ω are initialized based on the following equations 1 k 1 5 u i 2 2 ω k 0 5 c μ 0 25 l where i 5 is the turbulence intensity and l 0 07l is the turbulence length the empirical constant c μ is 0 09 the lower right boundary is the outlet where zero normal gradient conditions are applied to all variables the atmosphere includes the top the upper left and upper right boundaries of the domain a constant total pressure p 0 is used at the atmosphere which prescribes that the pressure adjusts according to the velocity as p rgh p 0 0 5ρ u 2 the surface of the square and the bottom boundary are modeled as walls to which no flux and no slip conditions and zero normal gradient pressure are specified in order to reduce the computing time wall functions are used in the near wall regions as required the first internal grid points are placed in the inertial layer 11 06 y 200 00 where the empirical relations apply moukalled et al 2015 due to the simple flow configuration the cartesian grid is used as shown in fig 2 the mesh orthogonality favors the computations by avoiding correction loops for the calculation of gradients moukalled et al 2015 non uniform mesh distributions are intentionally achieved with which the free surface evolution and vortex dynamics near the square can be captured at reasonably reduced computational cost a small mesh size near the square is chosen δx 1 40l this small mesh size is used in the region between 0 5l upstream and 3 0l downstream of the square see fig 2 b and increases toward the inlet or outlet with a low ratio see fig 2 a the grid convergence study for the cases with re 2 5 104 shows small changes of the force coefficients when the ratio varies among 1 025 1 03 and 1 04 as available in zhong et al 2019 the cases with re 9 9 104 are simulated in the present convergence study the results of which are provided in table 2 as shown in the table the relative changes of the force coefficients when the ratio varies among 1 025 1 03 and 1 04 are mostly within 1 0 in this study medium mesh densities i e the ratio in the longitudinal direction is equal to 1 03 or 1 1 03 are used as the basis for the mesh generations the timestep δt is set as 0 001 for the cases with re 9 9 104 and is reduced to 0 0005 for the cases with re 9 9 104 following the cfl rule which suggests uδt δx 1 0 throughout the simulations the cfl number is mostly lower than 0 5 as stated in zhong et al 2019 for the cases with re 2 5 104 the flow takes a longer time to reach the stable status at low d l than at high d l in specific the flow becomes stable after 300s when d l 1 0 while the stable flow emerges after 200s when d l 1 0 the same situations apply to the cases with other re values considered in this study nevertheless it is found that when re rises to a high value the required time for the stable flow formation reduces notably in order to simplify the simulation setup and data processing all the simulation time durations obey the rule in zhong et al 2019 the drag and lift coefficients as functions of time when re is 9 9 104 are plotted in fig 3 moreover the distance of the first internal grid point to the wall is selected as 0 025 l at the square surface and 0 050 l at the bottom respectively the temporally and spatially averaged y over the square surface for the cases with re 9 9 104 are between 11 06 and 100 00 as shown in table 2 indicating that the first internal grid points are positioned in the logarithmic layer 3 numerical simulations 3 1 governing equations computation of free surface flows involves modeling two immiscible fluids i e water and air in the simulations the vof model hirt and nichols 1981 is adopted to capture the surface evolution one notable advantage inherent in the model s surface capturing is the static mesh allowance which makes this method popular among cfd practitioners and engineers bruinsma et al 2018 higuera et al 2013 hu et al 2016 martínez ferrer et al 2018 the surface capturing in vof hirt and nichols 1981 is realized through the volume fraction which varies from 0 to 1 according to the percentage of one fluid in the cell volume a water cell is marked with α 1 an air cell is marked with α 0 and the air water interface is presented where 0 α 1 the advection equation of the volume fraction is given as 3 α t u α u c α 1 α 0 where u c is the artifical compressive velocity and is calculated by equation 4 the factor c a in equation 4 usually takes 1 the last term on the left hand side of equation 3 acts as a source of artificial compression for the convection of volume faction helping maintain the sharpness of air water interface and the boundedness of α between 0 and 1 this term is active only in the interface region and vanishes at both limits of α for further reference see rusche 2003 with the introduction of volume fraction the fluid properties at each cell are evaluated in the form φ αφ water 1 α φ air for example the fluid density is calculated as ρ αρ water 1 α ρ air 4 u cf α α min c α u f max u f the incompressible flow continuity and navier stokes n s equations are averaged over time to derive the reynolds averaged equations for the conservation of mass and momentum of the fluid as follows 5 u 0 6 ρ u t ρ uu p r g h g x ρ μ μ t u u μ μ t σ α α α where u denotes the mean velocity and p rgh is the modified pressure defined as p rgh p ρ g x the last term on the right hand side of equation 6 is the pressure gradient caused by the surface tension at the air water interface the time averaging process leads to the reynolds stress terms in the momentum equations bringing the benefits of using statistical analyses to account for turbulence effects although the accuracy of rans relies on the statistical models its favorable performance in industrial applications is acknowledged by the cfd community mannini et al 2010 ong et al 2009 stringer et al 2014 tian et al 2013 the unknown reynolds stress terms in equation 6 are approximated with boussinesq equation which is a basic equation for eddy viscosity models that transforms the calculation of reynolds stresses to the computation of turbulent eddy viscosity μ t the mentor sst k ω model menter 1994 is adopted to compute the turbulent eddy viscosity the turbulent eddy viscosity is obtained by solving two additional equations i e the transport equations of the turbulent kinetic energy k and the specific turbulence dissipation ω 7 ρ k t ρ u k μ μ t σ k k p k 0 09 ρ k ω 8 ρ ω t ρ u ω μ μ t σ ω ω c α ω k p k c β ρ ω 2 2 1 f 1 σ ω 2 ρ ω k ω 9 μ t 0 31 ρ k max 0 31 ω 2 s r f 2 where p k is the production of turbulent kinetic energy and s r is the magnitude of strain rate the constants in equations 7 and 8 depend on the blending function f 1 in the form φ f 1 φ 1 1 f 1 φ 2 where φ 1 and φ 2 are the corresponding constants in the original k ω and k ε models respectively the constants of the original models are assigned the following values c α1 0 5532 c β1 0 075 σ k1 2 00 σ ω1 2 00 c α2 0 4403 c β2 0 0828 σ k2 1 00 and σ ω2 1 186 the turbulent eddy viscosity is computed by equation 9 which is favorable as it guarantees that bradshow s assumption is satisfied moukalled et al 2015 3 2 numerical methods the continuity and reynolds averaged n s equations the transport equation of the volume fraction and the turbulence model equations are discretized using the finite volume method fvm performed in the open source package openfoam openfoam is a bundle of c libraries designed to solve problems like fluid flows combustions electromagnetics chemical reactions etc the fvm is implemented by integrating each term in the equations over a control volume and relating the volume integrals to the surface integrals using gauss s theorem the surface and volume integrals are both evaluated with the mid point integration approximation which yields second order accuracy the convective and diffusive fluxes at cell faces are evaluated with the second order upwind sou and central differencing cd schemes respectively the second order crank nicolson cn scheme is used for the time integration the interfoam solver in openfoam is adopted interfoam is capable of simulating two phase flows using the fvm discretization and the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 a flow chart regarding the solver was given in higuera et al 2013 interfoam employs the pimple algorithm to treat the pressure velocity coupling the principal of the algorithm is as follows within each time step both the outer and inner loops are executed in the outer loop the momentum and pressure correction equations are solved sequentially in an implicit manner while in the inner loop the momentum and pressure correction equations are explicitly established and solved the calculations are repeated until convergence is achieved in the present simulations three outer loops and nine inner loops are executed within each time step the solutions are regarded as being converged when the residuals of the velocity and pressure are lower than 1e 06 4 simulation results 4 1 global quantities the results from the present study are compared to those in luo et al 1994 norberg 1993 okajima 1982 saha et al 2000 sohankar 2006 and vickery 1966 as shown in fig 4 it is seen that when the square is placed at d l 4 5 where the free surface interference is weak the predicted force coefficients are in good agreement with the published data over a broad range of re thus it confirms that the present multiphase simulations can provide reliable predictions for the free surface flow note that a detailed validation of the present multiphase model for the simulation of rectangular cylinders near a free surface is referred to zhong et al 2019 2020 fig 4 also indicates that when d l is 4 5 the influence of re on the force coefficients is small this is consistent with the discussion by sohankar 2006 who reported that when re is in the range from 3 0 103 to 5 0 106 the reynolds number effect on the forces and wakes of a square is small sohankar 2006 registered that the insensitiveness of the flow to re is due to the fixed flow separation at the upstream corners of the square which undermines the role of laminar to turbulent transition in the boundary layer nevertheless for a reattached flow although the flow separation is spatially restricted the reattachment of the flow provides the basis of strong reynolds number effect mannini et al 2010 and schewe 2013 demonstrated that when the rectangular cylinder with w l 5 0 is inclined with respect to an incoming flow the symmetry of the flow is broken and as a result the separation bubbles on the upper and lower sides of the cylinder differ from each other specifically the separation bubble on the side which the rectangular cylinder is inclined toward expands or disappears while the separation bubble on the other side shrinks the differences in the shape and curvature of the bubbles lead to the dependence of the flow on re for the present study the flow symmetry is altered when an asymmetric boundary i e the free surface is included zhong et al 2020 observed that when a square cylinder approaches a free surface the separated vortex shedding becomes asymmetric at 0 6 d l 1 0 and suppressed at 0 3 d l 0 5 the asymmetry or suppression of the flow brings about the strong reynolds number effect on the wakes and consequently the forces as pointed out by malavasi and guadagnini 2003 through experiments of the flow past a submerged rectangular cylinder with w l 3 0 over the re range from 1 2 104 to 3 7 104 fig 4 shows that when d l is 0 3 0 7 or 1 0 the force coefficients vary significantly with re note that the selected d l values i e d l 0 7 1 0 and d l 0 3 respectively locate within the two ranges where the vortex shedding is asymmetrically separated and suppressed zhong et al 2020 despite the complex variations of the curves in fig 4 some characteristics of the relation between the force coefficients and re are observed the curves denoting the drag coefficient c d of the square located at d l 0 7 1 0 fluctuate with re while a constantly rising curve is shown when d l 0 3 see fig 4 a the two variation patterns of c d reflect the difference between the influences of the free surface on the separated and suppressed vortex shedding and vice versa this conception is confirmed by fig 4 d which shows notable fluctuations of st with re at d l 0 7 1 0 and a constantly decreasing st at d l 0 3 the jump in st at re 6 5 104 will be discussed later note that the variations of st with re when d l is 1 0 from the present results are different from those in malavasi and guadagnini 2007 where a positive relationship between st and re over the range of 1 2 104 re 3 7 104 was reported the apparent reason is the difference in w l i e 1 0 in the present study and 3 0 in malavasi and guadagnini 2007 but a comprehensive investigation on this is left for future works fig 4 c corresponding to the r m s value of lift coefficient c l further manifests the two patterns of variations at d l 0 7 1 0 and d l 0 3 respectively however the results in fig 4 b show that for both the moderate and shallow depth cases the averaged c l decreases drastically for the majority of re considered in the study it reflects the fact that the square receives larger cross flow downward pushing forces from the free surface at higher re regardless of the flow patterns the influence of the difference in vortex shedding i e asymmetric and suppressed due to the varying proximity to the surface is only disclosed by the r m s value of c l furthermore fig 4 d shows that when d l is 0 3 there exists a sudden jump in the st curve at re 6 5 104 the drastic variation in st implies the change of the suppressed flow which will be explored in the following flow structure sections in fact there exists a small range of re i e 5 0 104 re 6 0 104 where the characteristic vortex shedding frequency is bimodal as shown in fig 4 d 4 2 streamlines the time averaged streamlines over the square at three re values are shown in fig 5 fig 6 and fig 7 respectively it is seen that the deep depth cases are characterized by symmetric separation bubbles between the upper and lower half of the flow which are independent of re when comparing figs 5 c 6 c and 7 c this is in accordance with the force variations with re see fig 4 besides the streamlines in the three figures are similar to those for re 2 2 104 in sohankar 2006 where three dimensional single phase large eddy simulations les were conducted re dependent streamlines display when the square is in moderate or high closeness to the free surface the re dependence results from the surface induced modifications to the vortex shedding fig 5 a and b illustrate two streamline patterns of the square located at d l 0 3 and d l 0 7 when re is 2 5 104 in specific when d l is 0 7 the bubble above the square is compressed while the bubble under the square is expanded see fig 5 b the flow asymmetry is more evident in the wake where the upper bubble increases in size crossing the centerline of the square however although the flow is skewed due to the free surface proximity the periodic vortex shedding is retained the flow pattern is thus described as asymmetrically separated by zhong et al 2020 when d l is 0 3 the vortex shedding is suppressed see fig 5 a instead of periodic vortex shedding two large scale counter rotating vortices form behind the square occupying the major portion of the near wake the flow time series reveal that the two counter rotating vortices maintain their presence throughout while the strengths of the vortices rise and fall periodically leading to the periodicity of the flow which is notably lower than that of vortex shedding flows the two flow patterns displayed depending on the proximity to the free surface exhibit different variations with re fig 6 a and b show that as re rises to 5 0 104 the suppressed flow varies in a way that the sizes of the counter rotating vortices increase while the asymmetrically separated flow is manifested with enhanced asymmetry a different streamline pattern emerges when re is high as shown in fig 7 a and b when re is 9 9 104 the flow is remarkably skewed at both d l values accompanying the drastic surface evolution the resultant flow signifies the influence of surface jet and vortex interaction in the wake which will be presented later moreover fig 7 a indicates that with the formation of surface jet which enters and interacts with the wake the periodic vortex shedding is retained this is reflected by the jump in st when re is higher than 6 5 104 as shown in fig 4 d 4 3 free surface evolution and vortex dynamics the free surface is captured with the volume fraction α as aforementioned the air water interface is displayed where α is between 0 and 1 in fig 8 fig 9 the interface is depicted by three values of α i e 0 25 0 5 and 0 75 the vorticity around the square is also shown in figs 8 9 to present the wakes beneath the distorted free surface the vorticity component in the x 2 direction is defined as 10 ω 2 u 1 x 3 u 3 x 1 fig 8 shows the instantaneous free surface and vorticity around the square located at d l 0 7 with four re strong reynolds number effect on the flow is clearly demonstrated it is seen in fig 8 b that the positive vortices above the square are pressed at re 2 5 104 causing the asymmetry of the flow on the other side the free surface varies slightly with several small negative vortices sparsely distributed at the surface in fact the surface evolves notably during each cycle of vortex shedding following the regression and progression of shear layers and a description of this is available in zhong et al 2020 the small vortices at the free surface are restricted by diffusion from entering the wake while no extra contributions to facilitate the vertical motion of the vortices are received from the slightly curving surface when re rises to 5 0 104 the free surface distortion enhances showing a sign of overturning see fig 8 c fig 8 d indicates that the vortices at the surface increase in strength and start to interact with the shear layers from the square as re further increases the vortex interaction between the free surface and the square is evident fig 8 e shows that the free surface rises in front of the square but drops noticeably behind the square a distinct overturning surface is formed facilitated by the curved free surface the negative vortices from the surface move effectively downward and enter and interact with the wake due to the vorticity layer from the surface the vortex shedding becomes more skewed which matches the decrease of the averaged c l in fig 4 b the interaction of vortices becomes stronger when re rises to 9 9 104 fig 8 g shows that with the drastic surface evolution a large quantity of air is trapped in the wake and participates in the vortex interaction the transport of vorticity layer from the surface is dramatic as shown in fig 8 h resembling the surface jet in liu et al 2016 for a thin plate in the vicinity of a free surface and reichl et al 2005 for a shallowly submerged circular cylinder due to the surface jet two flow regions in the wake are identified with the upper right region occupied by the vorticity layer from the free surface and the lower left region occupied by the shear layers from the square the vortex interaction mainly appears along the slanting line area between the two flow regions the free surface evolution and vorticity of the square located at d l 0 3 is shown in fig 9 different variation process of the flow with re from the cases with d l 0 7 is observed fig 9 b shows that when re is 2 5 104 the positive vortices above the square are significantly pressed and flow in parallel with the free surface while the negative vortices produced at the lower corner of the leading edge are shed downward from the lower surface the vortex shedding is suppressed but the vortices are greatly lengthened the concept by reichl et al 2005 who stated a close relation of the suppressed vortex shedding to the reduced fluxes of vorticity fed into shear layers when d l decreases applies to the situation here analyses on the suppression of vortex shedding in section 5 2 will provide more insights into this fig 9 a shows that the free surface on top of the square fluctuates with the shape of the fluctuations resembling waves as re increases the free surface in front of the square rises but drops when passing the square causing fluctuations of the upper shear layer from the square see fig 9 c d although the strengths of the vortices increase due to the increased re the vortex interaction appears to occur far downstream where the positive vortices from the square approach the free surface the tendency of the upper shear layer shed from the square to move toward the surface is analogous to one of the metastable behaviors of the flow past a circular cylinder close to a free surface i e attachment to the free surface sheridan et al 1997 the vorticity layer from the surface or surface jet is evident when re is 7 4 104 and 9 9 104 fig 9 f and h show that the cross annihilation between the vortices from the surface and the square are more intense than that when d l is 0 7 see fig 8 h importantly the regular vortex shedding recovers from being suppressed with the help of the surface jet interference which is reflected by the sharp rise of st when re 6 5 104 as shown in fig 4 d this disagrees with the positive relation between the surface jet and the cessation of vortex shedding reported in reichl et al 2005 and arouses the authors interests in examining the mechanism of the suppression of vortex shedding discussions on this will be presented in section 5 2 it is worth noting that at the depth of 4 5l no surface jet develops even when re rises to 9 9 104 the formation of surface jet is considered to associate with the local froude number fr u 1 gd local 0 5 where u 1 represents the streamwise velocity in the area between the free surface and the square and d local is the instantaneous distance between the evolving surface and the upper surface of the square as will be presented for a shallowly or moderately submerged square the local fr is remarkably larger than the global fr and rises rapidly as re increases when the local fr is close to or higher than 1 0 the surface distortion increases drastically facilitating the transport of vortices from the free surface to the wake and thus the surface jet forms reichl et al 2005 5 discussions on flow features 5 1 surface jet and local froude number there are two processes involved when re increases as indicated by the analyses on the flow structure one is the surface jet and the other is the vortex interaction between the vorticity layer from the surface and the shear layers from the square note that the surface jet and the vortex interaction are not absolutely corresponding in terms of formation as shown in figss 8 9 but certainly the latter is a consequence of the former the formation of surface jet which is linked to the local fr is of interests in the present research it should be clear that the vortices at the surface with the strength equal to twice the local angular velocity multiplied by the local curvature lugt 1987 rood 1995 form as a result of the surface distortion but the surface jet establishes only when the vorticity layer accumulates in strength along with the increment of the surface curvature the surface jet is thus seen as the enhanced form of the vorticity layer at the surface although the separation of these two states is not straightforward as observed from the flow visualization the local fr provides a quantitative way to distinguish the states fig 10 shows the instantaneous maximum local fr in the area between the free surface and the upper surface of the square the local fr is sampled at eleven x positions equally spaced along the width of the square the instantaneous distance between the evolving surface and the square at each x position is used to obtain an accurate prediction the instants correspond to the time when the lift is minimum which are the same as those in figs 8 9 note that the main features of the local fr variation are well revealed by this instant since when the lift is maximum with the regression of the upper shear layer the free surface lowers resulting in a larger local fr the pre formation and formation of surface jet are plotted with dashed and solid lines in fig 10 respectively the absence of surface jet under deep depth condition is properly reflected by fig 10 d as the local fr of the deep depth cases remains lower than 1 0 over the whole re range for the shallow and moderate depths the local fr approaches or exceeds 1 0 when re is high fig 10 a shows that at d l 0 3 the local fr exceeds 1 0 when re is higher than 3 0 104 which corresponds to the formation of surface jet it is also seen that the local fr at the trailing corner position x l 0 5 is evidently higher than that at the leading corner position x l 0 5 this is due to the fact that as re increases the evolving surface reaches an elevated position upstream of the square but drops when passing across the square see fig 9 c e and g causing a higher local fr at near the trailing edge besides the variations of the local fr along the width of the square shown in fig 10 a exhibit a change when re is higher than 6 5 104 this re value relates to the development of vortex interaction in the wake and the restoration of regular vortex shedding similar to that in fig 9 f and h and also corresponds to the st jump in fig 4 d fig 10 b and c show that when d l is 0 7 and 1 0 the local fr rises gradually with re the critical re values for the formation of surface jet when d l is 0 7 and 1 0 are 4 0 104 and 4 5 104 respectively a reasonable conclusion is drawn that the critical re for the formation of surface jet increases with d l but when d l is sufficiently large achieving the deep depth condition the surface jet will not be developed whatever re values see fig 10 d furthermore there exists two important phenomena of the local fr first the present flow configuration is analogous to the open channel flow across a broad crested weir as documented in munson et al 2009 the flow passing over the weir block accelerates and reaches the critical condition fr 1 0 but does not accelerate to the supercritical condition fr 1 0 the flow remains critical over the weir block however fig 10 a c show that when the surface jet is formed the local fr transits from subcritical to nearly critical conditions and remains for a while before continuing rising to the supercritical condition along the width of the square note that the theoretical interpretation in munson et al 2009 is based on steady laminar flow assumptions for the present flow as shown in both figs 8 and 9 complex phenomena such as vortices from the surface and the square and the interaction between them contribute to the unbounded increase of the local fr second fig 10 a shows that the formation of surface jet is accompanied with the local fr larger than 1 0 at d l 0 3 while fig 10 b and c indicate that at d l 7 0 and d l 1 0 even when the local fr is lower than 1 0 the surface jet is formed together with the highly distorted surface this is because the skewed vortex shedding shown at moderate depths see fig 8 c d causes the rising and falling of the proximal free surface aiding the formation of surface jet 5 2 the suppression of vortex shedding from a general perspective there have been extensive studies on the suppression of vortex shedding due to the fact that vortex shedding phenomena can lead to unsteady forces on objects which is a source of vortex induced vibration viv and thus the failure of structures there are at present various methods to control vortex shedding e g introducing external objects in one of the shear layers imposing self oscillation on the objects modifying surface roughness and utilizing electric magnetic or thermal effects rashidi et al 2016 related to the present study is the flow over cylinders close to a plane wall or a free surface the explanation to the cessation of vortex shedding in the scenario of a circular cylinder near a plane boundary as stated in lei et al 2000 is the cancellation of the lower shear layer by the opposite signed vorticity of the wall shear layer preventing the interaction between the upper and lower shear layers for the case of approaching a free surface a similar conclusion was drawn by reichl et al 2005 who reported that the jet like flow around the submerged circular cylinder forms as the result of the reduced fluxes of vorticity fed into the upper shear layer following a quadratic dependence on the reduced velocity reichl et al 2005 also observed that when the vortex shedding ceases an extremely long quasi steady recirculation zone emerges at the rear of the cylinder which is the same for the present square case as shown in figs 5 a and fig 6 a however the difference between circular and square cylinders is obvious while the curvedness of a circular cylinder allows the free shift of shear layers over the structural surface the sharp cornered square restrains the separation position and shedding direction of shear layers wang and tan 2008 found that due to a straightened effect of shear layers the wake spreading and momentum exchange of square cylinders are lower than those of circular cylinders at the same gap above a plane wall thus it is anticipated that the suppression of vortex shedding for a square near a free surface may be contributed by factors other than just the reduction in vorticity fluxes in order to quantitatively demonstrate the relative strength between the upper and lower shear layers the vorticity fluxes calculated using equation 11 are employed this approach has been utilized by sheridan et al 1997 to describe the coupling between the upper shear layer from a circular cylinder and the vorticity layer from the free surface in forming a jet for the quasi parallel jet in sheridan et al 1997 the equality between f and f is satisfied at any section of the jet but in the present study the imbalance between vorticity fluxes is sought 11 f 0 u 1 ω 2 d y a n d f 0 u 1 ω 2 d y fig 11 and fig 12 show the time averaged vorticity fluxes at four x positions of the square located at d l 0 3 when re is 2 5 104 and 9 9 104 respectively the two cases represent the suppression and restoration of vortex shedding corresponding to fig 9 b and h respectively it is seen in fig 11 that when the vortex shedding is suppressed the vorticity fluxes in the upper shear layer are roughly comparable to those in the lower shear layer as indicated by the relative vorticity fluxes at positions a to d with values of 1 264 0 876 0 832 and 0 688 respectively fig 12 corresponding to the restored vortex shedding indicates that although the vorticity fluxes in the upper shear layer are notably lower than those in the lower shear layer at position a the relative vorticity fluxes at position b where the vortex interaction takes place is close to one by comparing fig 11 with fig 12 it is found that the cessation of vortex shedding is not only contributed by the modifications of vorticity fluxes in the shear layers due to the free surface interference but also more profoundly affected by the alterations of shedding directions of the shear layers the positions of peak vorticity fluxes in fig 11 imply that the upper shear layer flows nearly in parallel with the free surface while the lower shear layer moves downward leading to a gap between the two shear layers the restrained shedding direction of the upper shear layer mainly results from the presence of the upper corner of the trailing edge which prevents the shear layer from flowing downward as that of a circular cylinder reichl et al 2005 the restoration of vortex shedding at high re is aided by the skewed surface jet see fig 9 h which forces the recontact of the upper and lower shear layers to couple with each other forming the periodic vortex shedding note that positions c and d in fig 12 locate in the upper right wake region isolated by the surface jet where the upper shear layer is absent as shown in fig 9 h the characteristics of vorticity fluxes when anti symmetric vortex shedding displays are illustrated by fig 13 as shown in fig 13 nearly equal vorticity fluxes between the upper and lower shear layers are observed and close contact of the shear layers is also reflected therefore a reasonable explanation to the suppression of vortex shedding for the present flow is the detachment of shear layers caused by the sharp corners of the square combined with the modifications of vorticity fluxes due to the presence of a free surface the influence of re on restoring the vortex shedding functions with the formation of surface jet which promotes the recontact of the shear layers across the sharp corners 6 conclusions the reynolds number effect on the flow past a square cylinder close to a free surface was investigated in the present study two dimensional rans simulations with the mentor sst k ω model were conducted to reveal the flow properties the vof model was adopted in the multiphase simulations to track the free surface evolution the influence of re ranging from 2 0 104 to 9 9 104 on the global quantities and flow structures was analyzed as a reference case the square located at a deep depth i e d l 4 5 was simulated to demonstrate the small influence of re on the flow which is consistent with the published data for the shallow d l 0 3 and moderate d l 0 7 and d l 1 0 depths significant reynolds number effect was observed the main conclusions are summarized in the following 1 the force coefficients of a shallowly or moderately submerged square vary significantly with re different variation patterns of c d r m s value of c l and st with re at the two depth ranges were observed for the averaged c l a falling trend with re was observed for both the shallow and moderate depth cases moreover a sudden jump in st appears at re 6 5 104 for the cases with d l 0 3 2 the streamlines of the deep depth cases are characterized by symmetric separation bubbles about the centerline of the square which exhibit negligible dependence on re for the moderate depth cases the separation bubbles around the square are asymmetric which enhance in asymmetry as re increases for the shallow depth cases with the cessation of vortex shedding large scale counter rotating vortices emerge in the near wake the streamlines of both the shallow and moderate depth cases display a similar pattern at high re which correspond to the vortex interaction between the free surface and the square 3 the influence of re on the vortex dynamics of the square is intertwined with the rising surface distortion with re at both the shallow and moderate depths negative vortices form at the surface which accumulate in strength together with the increment in surface curvature as re increases and reach the state of surface jet when re is larger than a critical value for the deep depth cases no surface jet develops 4 the critical re values for the formation of surface jet at the 3 d l values i e 0 3 0 7 and 1 0 are 3 0 104 4 0 104 and 4 5 104 respectively moreover the occurrence of supercritical flow in the area between the free surface and the square indicates the significance of the complex flow phenomena such as surface jet vortex formation and shedding and vortex interaction the formation of surface jet at the local fr lower than 1 0 for the moderate depth cases is aided by the falling and rising of the free surface following the regression and progression of shear layers 5 the suppression of vortex shedding for the square located at d l 0 3 is more closely related to the detachment of shear layers caused by the sharp corners of the square than the modifications of vorticity fluxes by the free surface interference the restoration of vortex shedding at high re is due to the surface jet interference which forces the recontact of the upper and lower shear layers to couple with each other forming the periodic vortex shedding credit authorship contribution statement wenjie zhong conceptualization methodology software validation writing original draft visualization
